Now she is pregnant and asked me if I can scoop the litter until she give birth because of toxoplasmosis but I looked it up and as long as she wears gloves and washes her hands she should be good. So I told her absolutely not. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t happy but i reminded her of our agreement when we got the cat. I told her it was her responsibility and if she didn\u2019t want to take care of it anymore with the new baby coming we can get rid of it and find it a new home. She said no and has been scooping the litter. Her sister was over and saw her doing this and flipped out at me telling how dangerous it is. But of course her sister is going to be on her side and overreact.

OP- YTA.", "That part got me heated too. \nI'm pregnant and when my husband empties out the whole litter box to replace it with fresh litter, he makes me go into a different room completely because he doesn't even want to risk the chance of the tiny dust particles floating over to me as it gets dumped in the trash. \n\nOP YTA and you suck.", "Also, the fact that OP is 36 and his wife is 28 just makes me think OP has a maturity complex on her, making him feel like she's the immature one, while he is always the sensible one.", "We have *many* cats and my fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t really specifically WANT any of them, more of \u201cokay if it makes you happy go ahead\u201d but he doesn\u2019t particularly desire them type deal. Some are rescue fails when we did a lot of rescue work. Regardless, he volunteered himself/just took over cleaning our *four* litter boxes when I got pregnant without any complaints whatsoever (except how the one cat aims her pee outside the box\u2026 tall sides fixed that at least). \n\nNot only has he willingly done it for every pregnancy BUT ALSO just kept doing it between them because it had become habit \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nYes, OP, some women do change boxes when pregnant if they have nobody else to do it, and it would *probably* be fine\u2026 but why why why why why would you take the risk of it at all?! Just to stick it to your wife and be stubborn? How silly. Like\u2026 my freakin\u2019 dad would come scoop my boxes if I was pregnant and asked\u2026 so yeah definitely YTA my dude.", "Are 90% of AITA posts just about people hating their wives? Because wow does this man hate his wife. \n\nYTA.", "I read both your comments squished together and saw \" This made me snort crystals\" and was 90% sure that's not how that works XD", "Inb4 \"husband\" demands a doctor's note like a shitty boss would.", "Seriously. I've cared for two young people who's mother's were infected with toxoplasmosis while pregnant and they were both profoundly disabled, one tube fed, both in wheelchairs. This is the more extreme end of the spectrum but you just shouldn't risk it. We have a cat that my husband isn't fond of but he sucked it up while I was pregnant because he cared about our child.", "Happens all the time to cancer patients. They get diagnosed and the husband leaves. Switch the genders and the wife is statistically less likely to leave", "Sounds like a compromise baby too just like the cat. This is not going to end well.", "Yeah, his wife and baby\u2019s health are in serious danger, but he won the argument! That\u2019s worth more than anything and a *fantastic* way to start their parenting journey!", "\"But he Googled it!\" made me giggle snort. Bravo.", "My two boys are 14 & 16, the only time they see their father is at their grandparents house (who stay involved) it's in and out, both boys barely acknowledge him. He gave the boys each 10$ last year for x-mas, never a gift on b-day, no cards. He has a total of 5 children & his parents are the reason he has any contact with any of them. It's been this way for a very long time. Every time he gets in a serious relationship he knocks the new girl up , and he barely holds down a min wage job. I never went after him for child support bc his parents help me with anything I've ever needed. But even when we were together and I was pregnant HE STILL CLEANED THE LITTER BOX. This guy is TA 10000000%", "He\u2019s a giant Turd. I do not see any replies from him\u2026. I would like someone who knows Reddit better than me to list the things that it causes and how workplaces won\u2019t let you work with cat waste if your pregnant or trying to get pregnant. How to get it to the top.? Cause I bet he didn\u2019t read further once he realized he got lit up for his behaviour. Wonder what else he is awful about. I hope she runs. Or he at least gets advice from Reddit. And takes it.", "To be fair, we have a dog who refuses to acknowledge **my** existence. He is totally obsessed with my partner. I tell him regularly that if it weren\u2019t for me, he\u2019d still be in rescue because I\u2019m the one who found him. But he doesn\u2019t care. Hopefully the cat doesn\u2019t give a crap about OP (pun not intended, but I\u2019m going with it).", "Absolutely. Had a doctor tell me toxoplasmosis can be airborne while I was pregnant and that pregnant women should wear masks if they have to scoop, but that they really shouldn't scoop litter boxes at all. To be clear, toxoplasmosis exposure in utero causes SEVERE birth defects. This guy is sacrificing his wife and child on the altar of sticking to his guns, he's a monumental asshole.", "I have 2 kids as a single mom and one cat. I scooped litter while pregnant with gloves, mask and thorough handwashing, and my kids are fine. OP, YTA though because there is no reason for your wife to bother with having a husband if you don't do this sort of thing to help her.  Sure, she can scoop the litter and probably be fine, but than what use is putting up with your crap attitude towards the opportunity to be considerate to her?\n\nIf she is  on her own for this she might as well move her own things to her own apartment before it gets worse for her having you in her life. The only thing tougher than having a new helpless baby is having the entry of said baby be the time you realize your life partner doesn't care for you or your baby's welfare.  \n\nThe fact that you are asking this question and the way you ask make me think you are not likely to be a helpful partner and coparent. Kids come with a lot you have to do that you didn't specifically consent to in advance, man. So does marriage.  If you can't hack it you shouldn't be a husband/ parent. This is just such an easy thing to do for her. Are you going to make her bend down and scoop poop after a c section? When she is recovering from birth?", "Exactly. OP is intentionally being manipulative and putting his unborn child and wife at risk to convince her to get rid of the cat. \n\nI would be disgusted with my spouse if I was going through the pain, trauma and stress of pregnancy/childbirth and they refused to help with basic tasks during the pregnancy to help make things safer or a little bit easier.", "That's awful.  I'm so sorry.  I hope you have a better man now.", "lovely to see responsible well informed society here \ud83d\udc9c toxo is no joke", "I think this is my favourite reply. \n\nThere are other, well-reasoned and informative comments but THIS is the best. \n\nBe a decent human, OP.\n\nYTA", "I think some people want to prove a point so much that they would put someone's health at risk in order to do it.\n\nWhat would he do if his wife got hit by a car and was in the hospital and couldn't scoop the cat box?", "Also, the fact that OP is 36 and his wife is 28 just makes me think OP has a maturity complex on her, making him feel like she's the immature one, while he is always the sensible one.", "Why would his wife want to have a baby with this man who totally ignores their cat? Poor cat. Poor wife. Poor baby", "LMFAOOO", "People like this would use events such as hospitalization as an excuse to rehome or have the animal put down. He would argue OP isn\u2019t caring for it(since she\u2019d be in the hospital it wouldn\u2019t be possible) and would immediately get rid of the cat", "My friend and her husband have 4 cats (they both had 2 cats each when they first started dating). When she got pregnant, it wasn't *his* and *her* cats, it was **their** cats. So the husband took care of cleaning **their** cats' litterboxes for the sake of **their** baby.\n\nIt also bothers me that OP is enforcing what sounds like a verbal (and not legally binding) agreement that his pregnant wife has to honor or else he'll get rid of her cat. I can't fathom what other \"agreements\" he wants to enforce after the child is born.", "Word for word what I was thinking", "Yeah, until the baby does inconvenient baby-type things like crying in the night, or -- as another poster pointed out -- his wife gets tears or mastitis or another blow that inconveniences him.", "OP needs to read this.", "I like your neighbor.\n\nYeah, how do you live with a floof for 3 years and not feel the slightest attachment?", "Yes, it was. I think these pre-commitment conversations are important. I met too many women in my sister's mothers' groups where they didn't have these kinds of conversations and it turned out the husbands all became unwilling fathers. Every one of the kids now has some kind of behavioral issue from abandonment or the parents contradicting each other's discipline, etc. Even if the man in any of those couples eventually came around once the child was a teenager, by then the child didn't want anything to do with him. Just have those talks!", "Well, I mean, if this is how he treats his wife, he basically sees her as a shitty roommate whose cat he resents and who he HATEs having to do favors for.  \n\n\nWith husbands like that, who needs enemies?", "My neighbor is a great guy all-around. But also exactly what you said about OP. Unless there is some legitimate reason it\u2019s just a lack of normal empathy. I could understand if the cat had a habit of eating his stuff of peeing on his bed or pooping in his shoes, but it sounds like the cat is just chilling and he just hates it. I feel like OP would have said something about the cat\u2019s bad behavior if it had any to at least try and make himself look better.\n\nNot creating any kind of meaningful bond with an animal that lives under your roof for three years seems near impossible to me. Hell, I would go wave hello to my little brothers goldfish growing up because it was cute", "Loved this! I had a friend when I worked in a store in the mall, who could hear kids shrieking from a nearby playground, who proclaimed \"My tubes just tied themselves in knots.\" This is even better!", "You are the asshole. I\u2019d say your options to redeem yourself are to\n1. Suck it up and clean the litter box yourself.\n2. Buy a self cleaning box.\n3. Hire someone to clean the box for you\n\nYour wife is pregnant. She\u2019s dealing with emotional and physical changes you can\u2019t even imagine, and you can\u2019t even change a litter box for a couple months?", "I wonder what will happen if she is bedridden after labour? Does he bring her the litter box to bed? \n\nHe clearly doesn't understand what partnership means.", "I mean, given how he feels about cats, I\u2019m not feeling like he\u2019s going to handle a baby well\u2026. \n\nLike, there\u2019s not liking cats - and then there\u2019s refusing to help your pregnant wife with a cat because she\u2019s the one who wanted it. I sincerely hope he wanted a child!", "My father was the same way about scooping cat boxes when my mom was pregnant with me.  Unfortunately, at that time little was known about toxoplasmosis and there was no widespread internet yet.\n\nI developed schizophrenia in my teens.  My mother, to this day, blames that for my disease. (Edit to add: There are studies linking the two.)", "I keep thinking I wish I could say to Wife, \"When someone shows you who they are, believe them.\" Even if mother and baby get out of this unscathed, it's hard to imagine a happy household in their future.", "Lol maybe for some people?", "As a dude, this makes me puke. My wife has been thru 2 rounds of cancer, and I was there for her all the way. Not because I am so amazing, but because she's my wife who I love FFS.", "There's even a German phrase that means 'I'm disagreeing with you not because you're wrong but because you're being an asshole about being right.'", "Exactly...", "But it SHOULD be ok /s \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I was looking for this exact comment.\n\n\"Mu unborn child will probably be okay, maybe dead though we'll see.\"\n\nNarcissism goes fucking hard.", "This\n\nI was basically gonna say this without even reading the post", "He was useful....
