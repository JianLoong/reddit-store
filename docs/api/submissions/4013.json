Now she is pregnant and asked me if I can scoop the litter until she give birth because of toxoplasmosis but I looked it up and as long as she wears gloves and washes her hands she should be good. So I told her absolutely not. \n\nShe wasn\u2019t happy but i reminded her of our agreement when we got the cat. I told her it was her responsibility and if she didn\u2019t want to take care of it anymore with the new baby coming we can get rid of it and find it a new home. She said no and has been scooping the litter. Her sister was over and saw her doing this and flipped out at me telling how dangerous it is. But of course her sister is going to be on her side and overreact.

So basically, my brief Google search found that a pregnant woman should practically dress in a hazmat suit if they're going to be near kitty litter, but this man interprets that as \"she'll be good\" so he can invoke their pre-pregnancy cat chore agreement.\n\nOP, YTA eight ways to Sunday. Grow up and take out the kitty litter, hazmat suit optional.", "Actually I think OP cherry picked that information, only including the bit that he thought supported his case. \n\nAccording to the CDC:\n\n**Avoid changing cat litter if possible. If no one else can perform the task, wear disposable gloves and wash your hands with soap and water afterwards.**\n\n\nI'm betting many of the sites out there say this or something close to it. That it's best to get someone else to change the litter, but if you **can't** then you should use gloves and wash your hands after. \n\nObviously since that doesn't fit OP's narrative they conveniently left that bit out.", "And then I even asked some randos on internet too and they said it is all fine too.", "\"The baby came out of her body, why do I need to change the diapers? Ugh.\"", "One can hope", "We were this close to an \u201coh my god and they were roommates!\u201d opportunity", "I upvoted your comment. It happens so often. I'm so sorry for your boys.", "Solid birth control and shoring me up on the \u201cNEVER EVER trust a man who baldheadedly says he hates any animal but especially cats\u201d front.", "My uterus just curled in on itself like those roly-poly bugs.", "I\u2019m pregnant and it still read like birth control to me. Pregnancy, labor and post partum are fucking wild.", "In which case, I imagine he's going to get rolled by divorce proceedings and child support.", "I doubt he's going to be much of a parent. If he can't scoop poop for almost a year, how's he going to handle dirty diapers and puke? My bf and I have had an agreement for our entire relationship that if I get pregnant, litter box becomes his job until I can do it again, assuming we have cats. \n\nYTA OP. Your wife and child can get sick because you won't clean up poop.", "Absolutely. The husband is an AH and dumb as hell smh", "And that is why your husband is a keeper!\n\nRelationships are about each person putting in 100% of the work - not 50/50", "The first time there's a vomit or poop explosion, it's going to be mom's job to clean it up while he settles baby, for sure. Only for him to hand her the still-screaming child because he \"just couldn't get the crying to stop\", of course.", "hold up...you're an Elderberry too?!?!?! What up cous?!?!? You coming to the family reunion?", "Oh it\u2019s all good. I\u2019m learning to accept things as they are. I just wanted to add that in there because it for sure wasn\u2019t what a lot of folks planned, I imagine.", "Let us hope that his wife has the health, energy and support for this as a new mother.", "From your keyboard to God's ears. This guy is unreal. Or he's in denial. Or both.", "Oh come on we all know he won\u2019t even do that much as he cannot spend a few minutes cleaning a litter box. I hope she realizes how much she doesn\u2019t matter to her husband as he does not care about her..", "Wouldn't miss it for the world"]}
