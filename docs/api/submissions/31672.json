All was well until the topic of social media came up at dinner. I mentioned something about how Twitter was a toxic waste dump, full of hostility. My husband decides this is something to argue about and says that's not true. So we start arguing about it, and he's getting angry. Our guests were clearly becoming uncomfortable and quiet. Eventually he furiously says \"this conversation is over\", gets up, and abruptly leaves the room. I'm left in awkward silence, and have to apologize to my relatives.\r  \n\r  \nAfter they left, I told him how upset I was, that he made us look like two psychos arguing over something so stupid, and that wasn't a normal way to act with guests. He apologized, said he wouldn't do it again, and admitted to me that Twitter was awful and didn't know why he even argued about it.\r  \n\r  \nSix months later, we were visiting with another relative and he did THE SAME THING.

Today, he says nothing to me and doesn't bother to acknowledge it or apologize. I feel like I'm married to some big domineering gorilla that likes to make displays to show he's in charge and make everyone bow down to his foul moods. He doesn't even actually disagree or care about this topic, so I don't know why he does this. \r  \n\r  \nFinally I boil over and tell him I want him to leave the house, three strikes and you're out.

You\u2019re complaining that he turns into some big mean gorilla on this opinion that supposedly he doesn\u2019t agree with anyway (newsflash, HE OBVIOUSLY DOES) but you keep engaging in an actual argument over something so fucking stupid. \n\nShould he be getting so angry over it? No. Should you be arguing about it at all? No. And really should you keep insisting you\u2019re right until he\u2019s angry over it? No. \n\nYou\u2019re both acting crappy, but you seem to be egging it on. The fact that he concedes to you in private, tells me that he probably just wants to be able to enjoy his damn twitter without you insulting it and harping on it. What you\u2019ve done is insult something he partakes in, in a public setting, and instead of just letting it be a passive comment he disagrees with, arguing about something he obviously enjoys or he wouldn\u2019t be on it, until he feels belittled and angry. \n\nYep I talked myself into it. \n\nYTA. This is on you. Leave the man alone and stop making everyone around y\u2019all uncomfortable with your domineering personality. He may be getting mad and upsetting people because he\u2019s big, but it\u2019s you who\u2019s actually making things awkward by being a pushy jerk.", "NTA. If he only escalates in front of your family then it sounds like fragile male ego thing. You two need to have a serious discussion about boundaries. No more discussing the Twitter thing ever, even if someone else brings it up. Honestly debating things all the time sounds exhausting though. Are you sure it\u2019s always friendly banter? You should both probably talk with therapists separately and together because this feels like a \u2018it\u2019s not about the Iranian yogurt situation.\u2019 The subject of contention is not as important as why he admits he doesn\u2019t actually believe what he\u2019s saying but keeps getting furious over it and making a scene in public.", "I totally accept and admit that on this particular topic, I did not back down because I think it's honestly not even arguable and everyone knows Twitter is a cesspool. The initial time, he is the one who turned it from playful type banter into actually being hostile and angry though. For context, he is quite intimidating and large and serious, so when he gets mad it basically makes everyone go quiet and get nervous, like it actually has angry silverback gorilla in the room type vibes. I don't think it's okay to act like that in front of guests and make them nervous, and I feel like if I just back down and let him get away with acting like that, it will encourage him to do it more. I fully accept that maybe I somehow provoke him in social settings or something or maybe he gets embarrassed that I disagree with him on anything bc he thinks I should concede in front of others? I don't know bc he doesn't act like this when it's just us, he does this in front of my family specifically. On the Twitter topic specifically, we've had multiple totally good natured and normal conversations...sometimes initiated by him...where he actually agrees it's a cesspool, which is why I couldn't believe he argued about it again at the dinner table with my family last night.", "Judging by the number of times OP has argued with everyone\u2019s comments, this is spot on.", "Honestly though, isn't it kind of a fact? Don't get me wrong I scroll it now and then but mostly because it's like watching a car accident. If you type in \"why is Twitter such a\" into Google the first results are cesspool and horrible place...I feel like it basically is a fact? \n\nAlso we don't turn all events into this, they're not like screaming matches or anything, the first time it was playful banter and then he for some reason got mad and stormed out (he'd had a few drinks, that probably contributed to it). This last time there was no alcohol and I was just astonished he argued about it again when he had already apologized twice for this exact thing and promised not to do it again.  I do admit to not conceding the argument  bc I think I shouldn't roll over when he acts like this or Id just be playing into a stereotype that the man gets to be grouchy and angry in front of others and it's the wife job to smooth everything over and make sure hes not upset.", "Yes I kind of agree we are both AH. We do have other redeeming qualities but yeah. \n\nOn the kicking him out of the house, technically it's my house, I bought it before we were married and I pay the mortgage and he doesn't. Still, it is his home and he lives here. I did it because he wasn't talking to me and just being in a silent tense house together was making me want to crawl out of my skin. If we are a disaster bc we argue too much as everyone says maybe not living together is for the best, though we usually get along fine when it's just us, this only happens at holidays/family visits.", "people who say gaslight arent? i mean, venn diagram. theres a *lot* of overlap.", "Well technically it's my house, I bought it before we married and I pay the mortgage. He is supposed to pay 1/4 of monthly mortgage amount to me each month as shared living expenses but he only paid me one month out of twelve the past year. That said, although I bought it and it's in my name I don't generally consider it or call it \"my\" house, we both live here and he contributes to running the household. \n\nI know you can't have an argument unless someone argues back, but I feel that when he brings hostility and anger to a family event if I back down than I'm encouraging him to do it more...he is the one who gets mad, not me. I only got upset the second two times bc he specifically told me he doesn't even think what he was arguing and was sorry that he upset my relatives. For context we only see our families a couple days a year, so he has done this at every single family get together this year.", "I get it that an argument can only occur with two parties. But serious question, if one party is arguing for nonsense is it not more their fault? Or at the very least, why shouldn't they be the one to concede or drop it? Bc on this specific topic, he's arguing a position he doesn't even think is true and has told me that several times. So does that mean I just have to drop it and concede to him when he's arguing a nonsense position he doesn't even believe? Just to keep the peace and not cause a scene at the family events we only go to a couple days a year? I would never even argue with him in front of his family so I don't know why it's okay for him to do it front of mine and the only way I can stop it is to roll over like a doormat and let him domineer even on issues I know for a fact aren't even his actual opinion. It's like he's trolling me to embarrass me in front of my family.", "I agree it's totally weird. Why would he argue a position that he literally doesn't even believe, in front of my family at the dinner table? It may just be because he is surly and prickly in general about socializing and doesn't really enjoy having to \"play nice\" around others. He would rather be at home on the couch in his own domain where he's comfortable, so perhaps already being in a sort of stressed and sour mood makes him act like this. He doesn't act like this at home when it's just us. Or maybe he does and I don't notice because I'm more worried about not acting like the bickersons and people enjoying themselves in social situations? Not sure, I just know it severely embarrasses me when a hostile argument makes everyone in the room get quiet.", "Neither of us are kids for sure we're in our 40s. And fully admit we are both argumentative and stubborn. The difference is that when we argue at home alone it is usually playful and humorous and not an actual fight, usually we are laughing and teasing each other, or even if not no one gets mad and it's just a debate. But in front of others he actually gets angry and turns it uncomfortable. Which makes me suspect maybe he's okay arguing and bantering in private but in front of others that I should always agree with him bc he's supposed to be in charge or something. On plenty of other topics I just let it go and it's not a big deal and I would NEVER do this in front of his family. So I don't know why he does it in front of mine. Admittedly I did not concede or let it go the first time bc I honestly don't understand how anyone can argue with a straight face that Twitter is not one of the more toxic social media sites. I honestly was confused why he would even make that assertion. But yeah I get it one can't have a one sided argument.", "He wouldn't get the blame normally, he does in this case because it's in front of my family and I care about them not being made nervous or uncomfortable about stupid arguments, while he doesn't care. I would never argue with him in front of his family. After the first time I asked him to please not start arguments or bring bad moods/anger in front of my family when we only see them less than 5 days a year. So he knew that embarrassed me but did it anyway. I concede I am a contributing factor which is why I'm asking if IATA.", "eh op isnt just coming here talking about how bad it was, theyre still making their point about twitter! u/Sensitive-Aside-1224 is right there in this. i wouldnt trust its exactly how they say.", "Yeah it was the storming out and getting mad that was upsetting. Before that everyone was having a lively and fun conversation and that turned it completely awkward and embarrassing. He has a bad temper which is why he later apologized for that. The reason I feel it's okay to tell him to leave is because it's actually my house that I bought before we married, and I pay the mortgage not him. Granted it's his home now too and I consider it \"ours\" but he can afford a couple nights hotel room.", ">he doesn't act like this when it's just us, he does this in front of my family specifically\n\nThis seems an oddly specific trigger for this intermittent hectoring habit. Is there some previous awkward history between your family and your partner?", "reddits a cesspool too so you really have no room to talk", "I understand that backing down can seem like letting it happen, but he's unlikely to be able to continue arguing with no opposition. In future, I'd recommend trying to concede and diffuse the situation until the social situation's over, then confront him about it in private to avoid continuing to endanger/frighten whoever's with you.", "Not sure why you are stating your opinions as objective truths.

He doesn't like holiday/family events and isn't the most social person, so he's already starting out in a bad mood and gets easily annoyed or whatever and loses his temper. He does have a bad temper and flips out about tiny minor things every day (like accidentally knocking something over or not being able to find something). The difference is at home, he blows it out and yells and swears and then 5 minutes later is totally over it. So it's not really a big deal and is mostly comical. But you can't exactly act like that at a dinner with elderly parents or cousins that you see once a year. So when he loses it at dinner and shocks everyone into silence I'm left completely mortified and then angry at him afterwards bc he \"ruined\" the night. \n\nWe get along perfectly fine 99% of the time at home. I suppose I talked myself into a head of steam that he was purposely trying to humiliate me in front of my family bc it happened 3 times this year which are all the times we saw my family. But it probably wasn't on purpose. Maybe he should do some relaxation exercises beforehand or something, or I should be more accommodating in social settings. \n\nSome of my \"baggage\" is both my dad and my granddad were bad tempered men who frequently blew up and yelled and scared people at holidays, and their wives spent their whole lives fluttering around them, trying to soothe them and make everything okay. So I've always felt the need to not act like that or back down. However, my technique of not backing down isn't getting any better results than the concede and smoothe things over technique I witnessed.  I suppose a solution could simply be that he stays home and doesn't participate in family events since they're pretty rare. But I don't know if I want to be married to someone who can't just be good humoured and sociable for 5 days a year. We don't have kids so no issue there.

It seems to be more about his mood than the topic. Like one thing I know is to NEVER argue about anything before dinner when he's hangry. I guess I should add family holiday events to that list too.", "This is absolutely possible. He doesn't enjoy big holiday get togethers or visitors that are with us for more than a few days.", "We both use Twitter. I don't care that he uses it and I use it too. I totally see the appeal in scrolling the dumpster fire. Either our use or anyone else's never came up, the argument was purely about whether or not it was a dumpster fire. Which he actually DOES agree on, he's not just saying that to appease me lol I assure you he never does anything to appease me (which is fine, I don't need to be appeased). It's not about Twitter, it's something else. the more I am reading comments, the more I am convinced that the real issue here is just that he hates family holiday events, starts off uncomfortable, and if there's drinking that doesn't help so he just loses his temper more easily when he thinks I'm being annoying. We don't have this type of argument where he gets angry at home, we get along fine and any debates involve teasing and humor. It's something about being in the pressurized family context. \n\nI also probably am more sensitive there bc I don't want my family to think we're crazy or that I'm married to an angry guy, so I get embarrassed. Maybe he's not that different and I just don't notice when he's peevish at home, but it embarrasses me at a holiday dinner where people are on their best behavior.", "Don't worry, we don't and won't.", "I do have the legal right bc it's my house, I bought it before we married and our prenup says it remains mine if we ever split. That said, I actually did not want him to leave, I wanted him to apologize and explain why he keeps doing this and what suggestions he had for fixing it in the future. But that's what we did the last two times and clearly it didn't work to stop it happening again. So after he was ignoring me all day (and took the dogs for a fun hike without asking me to come) I had too long to stew about it and started convincing myself he must be doing it purposely to try to humiliate me in front of my family. Now that I've calmed down I don't think that's true. But I got wound up enough that I asked him to leave and he did not object or say anything, he just got up got his stuff and went.", "Lol see that's the kind of answer that would make both of us laugh. Probably all three TBH.", "For the most part our life is so boring and routine that I don't think it could be said to run on drama \ud83d\ude09. But yeah, we need some kind of game plan or clear rules for these rare holiday/family events to prevent this from replaying. Either that or stop attending together.", "Thank you! I think I'd have a hard time convincing him to go, but after reading all these comments, I'm willing to consider it when I wasn't before.", "But she doesn\u2019t? They both sound draining", "Yeah the Twitter subject is totally irrelevant and neither of us even care about that. The issue is blowing up and causing awkward silences at family/holiday events in the first place. That's not the kind of thing that bothers him, but deeply humiliates me. He is not at all afraid of conflict and will get into arguments with strangers at like the grocery store or in a park, if they do something he doesn't like. In those cases I always apologize and say sorry to try to smooth it over or mediate. But I don't like the idea of having to apologize for him and smooth things over with my family bc I think he just shouldn't act like that on the 5 days a year he's with them.", "Sounds like they both need to be the smartest people in the room\u2026", "There's more to this than I could fit into the character limit. \n\nAfter the first time when he stormed out, I had to have a whole conversation with my relative to calm her down and apologize. She's a retired psychologist so I went through the whole thing with her, had to convince her that he doesn't have PTSD from his service but just has a temper that blows over quickly and then he's totally fine five minutes later. \n\nAfter the guests left, he and I had a LONG conversation where I explained how embarrassing that was for me, and asked him to understand that when I only see my parents every one or two years, I do not want this to be the only thing they see when actually we get along fine most of the time and I don't want them to think he's scary or mean. He isn't, he's just used to a military culture where people yell and display anger and it's NBD. I pointed out that I never do this in front of his family (which he agreed I don't) and that it humiliates me when it happens in front of mine, and I begged him to PLEASE not argue about stupid stuff or get hostile in a way that makes people uncomfortable when we're at family events. Which he said he totally understood and agreed to and apologized both to me and apparently also texted our two guests and apologized to them (I found that out later). \n\nAll seemingly good. But then it happens again and it's like WTF we talked about this. That time I was more upset and when we made up we again had a lengthy conversation, where I tried to dig into why he did it and what made him get hostile or what set him off. He could not come up with any reason and said he didn't know, but promised it would absolutely never happen again. \n\nAnd then it did (granted my brother brought it up but he thought it was funny bc at the time we were joking around about how my dad is basically the dictator of his marriage so it was sort of a related topic). So the third time I just couldn't believe it and bc he didn't speak to me for the next 24 hrs I worked myself up into a boil thinking he either 1. Was doing it purposely to try to hurt or embarrass or fuck with me or something, or 2. Just literally didn't give a shit enough to care if he was embarrassing me. So I asked him to leave rather than sit around a tense and hostile house together. Now that I've calmed down I don't think it was either of those things and I probably overreacted but am also still hurt/angry that he did this repeatedly after we'd had long discussions and he promised not to.", "It's my house I bought it before we were married, and he didn't protest or object to leaving, he just left in silence.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Is it just whoever calls dibs first?", "Very astute. I am sensitive to it bc my dad was basically a dictator growing up and my stepmom spends her whole life fluttering around him, catering to him, waiting on him hand and foot and apologizing/interpreting for him. So I don't want to be like that. And my mom divorced my dad for being such a domineering AH so I don't want her to think I married my dad (though maybe I did). \n\nHe is not violent and I have no worries about that...I mean to be clear he absolutely would relish an opportunity to be violent in situations where he thought it was called for/acceptable. Like he has gotten into physical fights with other men when he saw them abusing their girlfriend or an animal or something (not regularly, like a few times over two decades). But he is very tall, fit, usually has zero expression on his face and talks in a very serious deadpan manner, and has no fear or much social sense whatsoever about conflicts or causing offense to peoole. So if he gets grumpy or loses his temper it's the type of thing that intimidates and silences everyone in the room. So everyone always defers to him. Like every male lawyer in my firm says things to me like \"I would never fuck with that guy\". In fact, my own dad said that to me! I think I am actually the only person who is not somewhat afraid of him, so that's part of why I try to stand up/push back and not just let him dictate social situations and what people are allowed to talk about according to his whims. \n\nYes, he is a good man. He home cooks dinner for our pets every night (and me). He takes our dogs literally every single day out on a long hike in the mountains. When it snows he doesn't just do our driveway, he does the entire neighborhood. He pitches in more than his fair share of housework. He goes and helps people replace their roof or build a deck or clear out a shed or anything else anyone needs. He volunteers. He would unhesitatingly run into any emergency or danger to help someone. \n\nHis personality is just kind of like not calibrated for civilian society. I am realizing reading through all this that I shouldn't have asked him to leave...problem is he kind of wouldn't even notice softer discussions and it takes a fairly strong/assertive move for anything to even register with him. But clearly we need some kind of rules/strategy here...maybe even god forbid therapy even though I can't imagine him going and not being annoyed by it.", "Thank you. I must say that after reading all of this and then sleeping on it, my conclusion is that this is a culture/military issue more than anything. It has absolutely nothing to do with Twitter so I shouldn't have titled it that way bc that's really not the issue it's more a general behavior in social settings thing where I get embarrassed bc his conduct breaks social norms... I just used the Twitter thing as a concrete example but that wasn't even a very illustrative one.\n\nBut he was in the military from 19 to his early 40s, and in a special forces unit where there are literally zero women so his whole adult socialization and norms are based on a culture that is just a completely different world than anything normal people are used to. He says things and acts in a way that would be completely offensive and out of bounds for most people, but that are par for the course normal behavior when you live for decades in that scenario. \n\nThe first time I overheard him on a work call I said oh my god did you just get fired? He's was like no of course not. I said did you just fire someone? He's like no what are you talking about that? That's my good buddy that was a normal conversation, that's just how we talk. But I'm telling you, if you overheard this conversation, it was laced with so much profanity and insults and seeming hostility you would think there was zero possibility it could be anything but a conversation where someone just lost their job. \n\nAnd you are right, he 100% thinks his time being deployed and in active combat was the greatest time in his life, super exciting and cool, and will never be topped. So I absolutely think that living a boring domestic life can be tough for him and having to go sit for 5 hours in situations with like kids running around yelling and adults making pleasant small talk conversation is for him somewhat like sitting through torture. The love of his life is his dog that he doesn't have to talk to but always up for adventures. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nSo the problem here is that I love him and accept his personality, but in social settings I am constantly on alert to prevent him from outright insulting or offending people, or steer conversations to safe topics, or explain it away when he just dropped a totally deadpan straight faced declaration that someone's hobbies or taste or lifestyle is garbage. He would think nothing of telling someone they're fat or that their kid's a brat, bc that's how he and his friends talk to each other but as you can imagine that would absolutely offend a \"civilian\". He feels like in doing so I'm being an annoying paranoid schoolmarm who is overly concerned with everyone else's opinions, treating him like a child and condescending, and should just leave him alone. \n\nI don't think he is capable of changing what seem like pretty deeply baked in personality traits, and would resist therapy. Or if he went he would think it was stupid and resent me for asking him to go. So you know if they have therapists who specialize in military guys? I assume yes and that's a dumb question.

But, I value the relationship more than my opinions and can respectfully change topics or not engage when I realize the conversation isn\u2019t productive and no opinions will change. Do better.", "Just the first time? You're still being argumentative in this post with literal internet strangers.", "I mean, you sound like you\u2019re just as much of a bully and a jerk than your husband. I HIGHLY doubt that your family doesn\u2019t fine you insufferable as well.", "You continue stupid arguments because you don't want to seem a pushover?\n\nThat's kindergarten thinking. \n\nAnyone who gets pulled into silly arguments that mean nothing is a maximum pushover. You get goaded into arguments over nothing because YOU ARE A PUSHOVER.", "Do you feel like the two might be related? I wonder if it\u2019s possible he\u2019s feeling stress or like he doesn\u2019t have control in his life and he\u2019s developed an unhealthy coping strategy. What people are saying is true about it taking two people to have an argument- but you should be able to have your own opinions and express them. It doesnt seem like at the start of the first few arguments that you were trying to have a discussion or argue with him, that you were just stating an opinion. It might be worth setting aside the twitter portion (which you both seem hung up on), and seeing if you can have a conversation about why theres been a change in the way you communicate", "I understand it\u2019s her house. They are married. She is the one that\u2019s upset. How long would you stay married to somebody? Who kicked you out of your own home when they were upset with you?

But the third and fourth time you should be prepared and therefore you should have your plan ready and it should be easy to execute.  \n\nI think it's fairly easy to ignore someone at a dinner table because there are a million other things to talk about amongst family.", "I agree that she should have but who's to say she didn't try to? I'll admit it, I'm assuming here but the husband sounds like one of those types who will keep going once something has been brought up despite a change in the subject.", "Mmmm no, not sure the onus should be on her to prevent her husband from going off on an extended rant when he knows it makes everyone else in the room uncomfortable. He's a grown man.", "It also sounds like he\u2019s doubling down on these topics because he\u2019s already feeling resentful about not being able to enjoy holidays at home\u2026", "This sub is like a meeting place of narcissists and people craving for validation in their real life. The later frame entire thing as if how innocent they are, many times leaving out tiny crucial details, while the former act as if how untangled life they live and throw out judgements and suggestions as if they are offsprings of Judge Judy and Dr. Phil. \n\nI am here because of the same reason why everyone watches shows like judge Judy and Dr. Phil, drama drama drama...", "totally agree. So much is fake here yet we all just eat it up so we can judge people. it is pretty close to the bottom when it comes to the cesspool.", "I\u2019m so glad someone else caught all of this!", "Does he disagree though? It sounds like in private, he concedes that he agrees with her and only disagrees in front of other people.", "Yep. That doesn\u2019t mean his behavior is the best either, but I completely understand it.

Counseling is always good idea as no couple is the same and what worked for us might not work for you. But if you want to try your self, first it needs \"the talk\" that is done when you both are calm (not during the argument). \n\nFor us we tried to pin point what are the triggers for us and what are the things that helps us to calm down. Then we agreed what the other one can do to help that (hard one is that it can't just say \"I don't like you to shout at me\" it is more of \"what can I do for help you to not shout at me but l still have to be able to inform you what bothers me\"). For us, the agreed signal is (this is about the debates getting out of hands): \"this seems to be one of those things we can agree to disagree, isn't it honey?\" The question part is important for us because it lets the other one to agree, it is not a command, and we can diffuse the situation.", "He sounds abusive", "Your account of your husband and the way he talks with his friends makes me very afraid of military people and concerned for you if he ever feels pushed beyond his control.", "It\u2019s starting to sound like there\u2019s very little that doesn\u2019t offend him.", "How often do you guys see his family? Does he act this way in front of them? If he can't respect you or your family, then it's probably best he doesn't attend. That's on him to communicate though. He has given no indication that he doesn't want to go other than violently arguing with you in front of your family. And whether he wants to be there or not, he needs to understand that some of your family might not be comfortable with him attending when he acts like that so often. If he feels out of place socializing with your family, him acting like this is only going to isolate him further. He also openly has admitted he is doing this on purpose. Maybe the rest of your relationship could use some thought. Does he act like this in other areas of your relationship? He should never want to hurt or embarrass you, even if he disagrees with your opinion (which he doesn't). He definitely shouldn't raise his voice at you or intimidate you. \n\nAll in all, seems like a very concerning situation for you. Only you know the truth of what your relationship is like, so if you feel safe to work through this, I wish you the best. If you don't, I hope you are able to get the support you need.", "Guys who never *talk* about their feelings are usually the guys who are the most *ashamed* of their feelings. \n\nNot talking about emotions is not solid evidence that he doesn\u2019t have any.

You can argue without being disrespectful with your partner. You both need therapy. By yourselves and also couple therapy if you'd like to save your marriage. \n\nMy partner and I have this system when we know we are about to get into a full argument. We have a word that stop us from keep talking and getting angrier. For us, this word is \"86\" (you can use whatever works for you). Whoever says it needs to set up a day and hour when we can calmly continue the discussion. It works and has already help us to improve the way we settle arguments", "Having gotten a fuller picture from some of OP's other comments, I do think the truth is a bit more complicated.  It seems that he and his wife tend to engage in a kind of 'playful banter,' as she has described it, and some of her family members, on witnessing this playful banter, tend to jump in to 'protect her'... which offends him, because she doesn't fucking need protection from him.  But rather than telling them to butt out, she joins the mob and goads him, winding him up until he flips out.  They all gang up on him and egg him on... her family seems to take the 'banter' too seriously, and it seems like she enjoys seeing him get riled up... that is, until the resulting outburst caused by him feeling attacked.", "I actually do not like Twitter.

At home you may think it's humorous, but maybe you are missing the signs that it's not.", "Nah, \"Remember that time you got all mad about twitter?\" Is not a funny holiday story for her brother to bring up.

So in essence you revert to the feelings you had as a child when you were scared/embarrassed by a yelling man and you go into overdrive to prove that you\u2019re not the woman who backs down. You\u2019re really replaying this trauma over again. This is the kind of thing a therapist would go to town on."]}
