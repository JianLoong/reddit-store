All was well until the topic of social media came up at dinner. I mentioned something about how Twitter was a toxic waste dump, full of hostility. My husband decides this is something to argue about and says that's not true. So we start arguing about it, and he's getting angry. Our guests were clearly becoming uncomfortable and quiet. Eventually he furiously says \"this conversation is over\", gets up, and abruptly leaves the room. I'm left in awkward silence, and have to apologize to my relatives.\r  \n\r  \nAfter they left, I told him how upset I was, that he made us look like two psychos arguing over something so stupid, and that wasn't a normal way to act with guests. He apologized, said he wouldn't do it again, and admitted to me that Twitter was awful and didn't know why he even argued about it.\r  \n\r  \nSix months later, we were visiting with another relative and he did THE SAME THING.

You\u2019re complaining that he turns into some big mean gorilla on this opinion that supposedly he doesn\u2019t agree with anyway (newsflash, HE OBVIOUSLY DOES) but you keep engaging in an actual argument over something so fucking stupid. \n\nShould he be getting so angry over it? No. Should you be arguing about it at all? No. And really should you keep insisting you\u2019re right until he\u2019s angry over it? No. \n\nYou\u2019re both acting crappy, but you seem to be egging it on. The fact that he concedes to you in private, tells me that he probably just wants to be able to enjoy his damn twitter without you insulting it and harping on it. What you\u2019ve done is insult something he partakes in, in a public setting, and instead of just letting it be a passive comment he disagrees with, arguing about something he obviously enjoys or he wouldn\u2019t be on it, until he feels belittled and angry. \n\nYep I talked myself into it. \n\nYTA. This is on you. Leave the man alone and stop making everyone around y\u2019all uncomfortable with your domineering personality. He may be getting mad and upsetting people because he\u2019s big, but it\u2019s you who\u2019s actually making things awkward by being a pushy jerk.", "NTA. If he only escalates in front of your family then it sounds like fragile male ego thing. You two need to have a serious discussion about boundaries. No more discussing the Twitter thing ever, even if someone else brings it up. Honestly debating things all the time sounds exhausting though. Are you sure it\u2019s always friendly banter? You should both probably talk with therapists separately and together because this feels like a \u2018it\u2019s not about the Iranian yogurt situation.\u2019 The subject of contention is not as important as why he admits he doesn\u2019t actually believe what he\u2019s saying but keeps getting furious over it and making a scene in public.", "I totally accept and admit that on this particular topic, I did not back down because I think it's honestly not even arguable and everyone knows Twitter is a cesspool. The initial time, he is the one who turned it from playful type banter into actually being hostile and angry though. For context, he is quite intimidating and large and serious, so when he gets mad it basically makes everyone go quiet and get nervous, like it actually has angry silverback gorilla in the room type vibes. I don't think it's okay to act like that in front of guests and make them nervous, and I feel like if I just back down and let him get away with acting like that, it will encourage him to do it more. I fully accept that maybe I somehow provoke him in social settings or something or maybe he gets embarrassed that I disagree with him on anything bc he thinks I should concede in front of others? I don't know bc he doesn't act like this when it's just us, he does this in front of my family specifically. On the Twitter topic specifically, we've had multiple totally good natured and normal conversations...sometimes initiated by him...where he actually agrees it's a cesspool, which is why I couldn't believe he argued about it again at the dinner table with my family last night.", "Judging by the number of times OP has argued with everyone\u2019s comments, this is spot on.", "Honestly though, isn't it kind of a fact? Don't get me wrong I scroll it now and then but mostly because it's like watching a car accident. If you type in \"why is Twitter such a\" into Google the first results are cesspool and horrible place...I feel like it basically is a fact? \n\nAlso we don't turn all events into this, they're not like screaming matches or anything, the first time it was playful banter and then he for some reason got mad and stormed out (he'd had a few drinks, that probably contributed to it). This last time there was no alcohol and I was just astonished he argued about it again when he had already apologized twice for this exact thing and promised not to do it again.  I do admit to not conceding the argument  bc I think I shouldn't roll over when he acts like this or Id just be playing into a stereotype that the man gets to be grouchy and angry in front of others and it's the wife job to smooth everything over and make sure hes not upset.", "Yes I kind of agree we are both AH. We do have other redeeming qualities but yeah. \n\nOn the kicking him out of the house, technically it's my house, I bought it before we were married and I pay the mortgage and he doesn't. Still, it is his home and he lives here. I did it because he wasn't talking to me and just being in a silent tense house together was making me want to crawl out of my skin. If we are a disaster bc we argue too much as everyone says maybe not living together is for the best, though we usually get along fine when it's just us, this only happens at holidays/family visits.", "people who say gaslight arent? i mean, venn diagram. theres a *lot* of overlap.", "Well technically it's my house, I bought it before we married and I pay the mortgage. He is supposed to pay 1/4 of monthly mortgage amount to me each month as shared living expenses but he only paid me one month out of twelve the past year. That said, although I bought it and it's in my name I don't generally consider it or call it \"my\" house, we both live here and he contributes to running the household. \n\nI know you can't have an argument unless someone argues back, but I feel that when he brings hostility and anger to a family event if I back down than I'm encouraging him to do it more...he is the one who gets mad, not me. I only got upset the second two times bc he specifically told me he doesn't even think what he was arguing and was sorry that he upset my relatives. For context we only see our families a couple days a year, so he has done this at every single family get together this year.", "I get it that an argument can only occur with two parties. But serious question, if one party is arguing for nonsense is it not more their fault? Or at the very least, why shouldn't they be the one to concede or drop it? Bc on this specific topic, he's arguing a position he doesn't even think is true and has told me that several times. So does that mean I just have to drop it and concede to him when he's arguing a nonsense position he doesn't even believe? Just to keep the peace and not cause a scene at the family events we only go to a couple days a year? I would never even argue with him in front of his family so I don't know why it's okay for him to do it front of mine and the only way I can stop it is to roll over like a doormat and let him domineer even on issues I know for a fact aren't even his actual opinion. It's like he's trolling me to embarrass me in front of my family.", "I agree it's totally weird. Why would he argue a position that he literally doesn't even believe, in front of my family at the dinner table? It may just be because he is surly and prickly in general about socializing and doesn't really enjoy having to \"play nice\" around others. He would rather be at home on the couch in his own domain where he's comfortable, so perhaps already being in a sort of stressed and sour mood makes him act like this. He doesn't act like this at home when it's just us. Or maybe he does and I don't notice because I'm more worried about not acting like the bickersons and people enjoying themselves in social situations? Not sure, I just know it severely embarrasses me when a hostile argument makes everyone in the room get quiet.", "Neither of us are kids for sure we're in our 40s. And fully admit we are both argumentative and stubborn. The difference is that when we argue at home alone it is usually playful and humorous and not an actual fight, usually we are laughing and teasing each other, or even if not no one gets mad and it's just a debate. But in front of others he actually gets angry and turns it uncomfortable. Which makes me suspect maybe he's okay arguing and bantering in private but in front of others that I should always agree with him bc he's supposed to be in charge or something. On plenty of other topics I just let it go and it's not a big deal and I would NEVER do this in front of his family. So I don't know why he does it in front of mine. Admittedly I did not concede or let it go the first time bc I honestly don't understand how anyone can argue with a straight face that Twitter is not one of the more toxic social media sites. I honestly was confused why he would even make that assertion. But yeah I get it one can't have a one sided argument.", "He wouldn't get the blame normally, he does in this case because it's in front of my family and I care about them not being made nervous or uncomfortable about stupid arguments, while he doesn't care. I would never argue with him in front of his family. After the first time I asked him to please not start arguments or bring bad moods/anger in front of my family when we only see them less than 5 days a year. So he knew that embarrassed me but did it anyway. I concede I am a contributing factor which is why I'm asking if IATA.", "eh op isnt just coming here talking about how bad it was, theyre still making their point about twitter! u/Sensitive-Aside-1224 is right there in this. i wouldnt trust its exactly how they say.", "Yeah it was the storming out and getting mad that was upsetting. Before that everyone was having a lively and fun conversation and that turned it completely awkward and embarrassing. He has a bad temper which is why he later apologized for that. The reason I feel it's okay to tell him to leave is because it's actually my house that I bought before we married, and I pay the mortgage not him. Granted it's his home now too and I consider it \"ours\" but he can afford a couple nights hotel room.", ">he doesn't act like this when it's just us, he does this in front of my family specifically\n\nThis seems an oddly specific trigger for this intermittent hectoring habit. Is there some previous awkward history between your family and your partner?", "reddits a cesspool too so you really have no room to talk", "I understand that backing down can seem like letting it happen, but he's unlikely to be able to continue arguing with no opposition. In future, I'd recommend trying to concede and diffuse the situation until the social situation's over, then confront him about it in private to avoid continuing to endanger/frighten whoever's with you.", "Not sure why you are stating your opinions as objective truths.

STFU.", "ok i have combative people who have moments in my life too, sometimes they feel they are looked at as dumber or whatever insecurity they have, who cares, i love them and deal. its nothing to do with me. they deal with me too.\n\nif they arent actively trying to undermine you theyre just a person. thats all. you dont like it, get a golden retriever who will also try to undermine you. not good advice now that i say that. but i love them. theyre great. they love me.", "Haha we do have dogs actually and sadly we are both much nicer and sweeter to the dogs than each other. Actually our life revolves around the dogs, they run the house! But they are perfect angels of course and never argue back. \ud83d\ude0a", "aw. sounds like your husband doesnt handle big formal dinners well, oh well. if hes great otherwise with the kids and the puppies and you then eff that. who cares. people think way more about themselves than they do about you. everyone there will get on with it.\n\nhes wrong to act that way, noone is right in the argument, if you got a good deal then good. if not, turn em and burn em.", "That's a good point, I think that's what happens. He doesn't like holiday/family events and isn't the most social person, so he's already starting out in a bad mood and gets easily annoyed or whatever and loses his temper. He does have a bad temper and flips out about tiny minor things every day (like accidentally knocking something over or not being able to find something). The difference is at home, he blows it out and yells and swears and then 5 minutes later is totally over it. So it's not really a big deal and is mostly comical. But you can't exactly act like that at a dinner with elderly parents or cousins that you see once a year. So when he loses it at dinner and shocks everyone into silence I'm left completely mortified and then angry at him afterwards bc he \"ruined\" the night. \n\nWe get along perfectly fine 99% of the time at home. I suppose I talked myself into a head of steam that he was purposely trying to humiliate me in front of my family bc it happened 3 times this year which are all the times we saw my family. But it probably wasn't on purpose. Maybe he should do some relaxation exercises beforehand or something, or I should be more accommodating in social settings. \n\nSome of my \"baggage\" is both my dad and my granddad were bad tempered men who frequently blew up and yelled and scared people at holidays, and their wives spent their whole lives fluttering around them, trying to soothe them and make everything okay. So I've always felt the need to not act like that or back down. However, my technique of not backing down isn't getting any better results than the concede and smoothe things over technique I witnessed.  I suppose a solution could simply be that he stays home and doesn't participate in family events since they're pretty rare. But I don't know if I want to be married to someone who can't just be good humoured and sociable for 5 days a year. We don't have kids so no issue there. He is a good man in other ways, takes wonderful care of our dogs, and we don't have any of the more standard problems with money, sex, dividing housework, etc. Anyway, thanks for your thoughts."]}
