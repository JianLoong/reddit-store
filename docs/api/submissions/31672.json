All was well until the topic of social media came up at dinner. I mentioned something about how Twitter was a toxic waste dump, full of hostility. My husband decides this is something to argue about and says that's not true. So we start arguing about it, and he's getting angry. Our guests were clearly becoming uncomfortable and quiet. Eventually he furiously says \"this conversation is over\", gets up, and abruptly leaves the room. I'm left in awkward silence, and have to apologize to my relatives.\r  \n\r  \nAfter they left, I told him how upset I was, that he made us look like two psychos arguing over something so stupid, and that wasn't a normal way to act with guests. He apologized, said he wouldn't do it again, and admitted to me that Twitter was awful and didn't know why he even argued about it.\r  \n\r  \nSix months later, we were visiting with another relative and he did THE SAME THING.

Today, he says nothing to me and doesn't bother to acknowledge it or apologize. I feel like I'm married to some big domineering gorilla that likes to make displays to show he's in charge and make everyone bow down to his foul moods. He doesn't even actually disagree or care about this topic, so I don't know why he does this. \r  \n\r  \nFinally I boil over and tell him I want him to leave the house, three strikes and you're out.

You\u2019re complaining that he turns into some big mean gorilla on this opinion that supposedly he doesn\u2019t agree with anyway (newsflash, HE OBVIOUSLY DOES) but you keep engaging in an actual argument over something so fucking stupid. \n\nShould he be getting so angry over it? No. Should you be arguing about it at all? No. And really should you keep insisting you\u2019re right until he\u2019s angry over it? No. \n\nYou\u2019re both acting crappy, but you seem to be egging it on. The fact that he concedes to you in private, tells me that he probably just wants to be able to enjoy his damn twitter without you insulting it and harping on it. What you\u2019ve done is insult something he partakes in, in a public setting, and instead of just letting it be a passive comment he disagrees with, arguing about something he obviously enjoys or he wouldn\u2019t be on it, until he feels belittled and angry. \n\nYep I talked myself into it. \n\nYTA. This is on you. Leave the man alone and stop making everyone around y\u2019all uncomfortable with your domineering personality. He may be getting mad and upsetting people because he\u2019s big, but it\u2019s you who\u2019s actually making things awkward by being a pushy jerk.", "NTA. If he only escalates in front of your family then it sounds like fragile male ego thing. You two need to have a serious discussion about boundaries. No more discussing the Twitter thing ever, even if someone else brings it up. Honestly debating things all the time sounds exhausting though. Are you sure it\u2019s always friendly banter? You should both probably talk with therapists separately and together because this feels like a \u2018it\u2019s not about the Iranian yogurt situation.\u2019 The subject of contention is not as important as why he admits he doesn\u2019t actually believe what he\u2019s saying but keeps getting furious over it and making a scene in public.", "I totally accept and admit that on this particular topic, I did not back down because I think it's honestly not even arguable and everyone knows Twitter is a cesspool. The initial time, he is the one who turned it from playful type banter into actually being hostile and angry though. For context, he is quite intimidating and large and serious, so when he gets mad it basically makes everyone go quiet and get nervous, like it actually has angry silverback gorilla in the room type vibes. I don't think it's okay to act like that in front of guests and make them nervous, and I feel like if I just back down and let him get away with acting like that, it will encourage him to do it more. I fully accept that maybe I somehow provoke him in social settings or something or maybe he gets embarrassed that I disagree with him on anything bc he thinks I should concede in front of others? I don't know bc he doesn't act like this when it's just us, he does this in front of my family specifically. On the Twitter topic specifically, we've had multiple totally good natured and normal conversations...sometimes initiated by him...where he actually agrees it's a cesspool, which is why I couldn't believe he argued about it again at the dinner table with my family last night.", "Judging by the number of times OP has argued with everyone\u2019s comments, this is spot on.", "Honestly though, isn't it kind of a fact? Don't get me wrong I scroll it now and then but mostly because it's like watching a car accident. If you type in \"why is Twitter such a\" into Google the first results are cesspool and horrible place...I feel like it basically is a fact? \n\nAlso we don't turn all events into this, they're not like screaming matches or anything, the first time it was playful banter and then he for some reason got mad and stormed out (he'd had a few drinks, that probably contributed to it). This last time there was no alcohol and I was just astonished he argued about it again when he had already apologized twice for this exact thing and promised not to do it again.  I do admit to not conceding the argument  bc I think I shouldn't roll over when he acts like this or Id just be playing into a stereotype that the man gets to be grouchy and angry in front of others and it's the wife job to smooth everything over and make sure hes not upset.", "Yes I kind of agree we are both AH. We do have other redeeming qualities but yeah. \n\nOn the kicking him out of the house, technically it's my house, I bought it before we were married and I pay the mortgage and he doesn't. Still, it is his home and he lives here. I did it because he wasn't talking to me and just being in a silent tense house together was making me want to crawl out of my skin. If we are a disaster bc we argue too much as everyone says maybe not living together is for the best, though we usually get along fine when it's just us, this only happens at holidays/family visits.", "people who say gaslight arent? i mean, venn diagram. theres a *lot* of overlap.", "Well technically it's my house, I bought it before we married and I pay the mortgage. He is supposed to pay 1/4 of monthly mortgage amount to me each month as shared living expenses but he only paid me one month out of twelve the past year. That said, although I bought it and it's in my name I don't generally consider it or call it \"my\" house, we both live here and he contributes to running the household. \n\nI know you can't have an argument unless someone argues back, but I feel that when he brings hostility and anger to a family event if I back down than I'm encouraging him to do it more...he is the one who gets mad, not me. I only got upset the second two times bc he specifically told me he doesn't even think what he was arguing and was sorry that he upset my relatives. For context we only see our families a couple days a year, so he has done this at every single family get together this year.", "I get it that an argument can only occur with two parties. But serious question, if one party is arguing for nonsense is it not more their fault? Or at the very least, why shouldn't they be the one to concede or drop it? Bc on this specific topic, he's arguing a position he doesn't even think is true and has told me that several times. So does that mean I just have to drop it and concede to him when he's arguing a nonsense position he doesn't even believe? Just to keep the peace and not cause a scene at the family events we only go to a couple days a year? I would never even argue with him in front of his family so I don't know why it's okay for him to do it front of mine and the only way I can stop it is to roll over like a doormat and let him domineer even on issues I know for a fact aren't even his actual opinion. It's like he's trolling me to embarrass me in front of my family.", "I agree it's totally weird. Why would he argue a position that he literally doesn't even believe, in front of my family at the dinner table? It may just be because he is surly and prickly in general about socializing and doesn't really enjoy having to \"play nice\" around others. He would rather be at home on the couch in his own domain where he's comfortable, so perhaps already being in a sort of stressed and sour mood makes him act like this. He doesn't act like this at home when it's just us. Or maybe he does and I don't notice because I'm more worried about not acting like the bickersons and people enjoying themselves in social situations? Not sure, I just know it severely embarrasses me when a hostile argument makes everyone in the room get quiet.", "Neither of us are kids for sure we're in our 40s. And fully admit we are both argumentative and stubborn. The difference is that when we argue at home alone it is usually playful and humorous and not an actual fight, usually we are laughing and teasing each other, or even if not no one gets mad and it's just a debate. But in front of others he actually gets angry and turns it uncomfortable. Which makes me suspect maybe he's okay arguing and bantering in private but in front of others that I should always agree with him bc he's supposed to be in charge or something. On plenty of other topics I just let it go and it's not a big deal and I would NEVER do this in front of his family. So I don't know why he does it in front of mine. Admittedly I did not concede or let it go the first time bc I honestly don't understand how anyone can argue with a straight face that Twitter is not one of the more toxic social media sites. I honestly was confused why he would even make that assertion. But yeah I get it one can't have a one sided argument.", "He wouldn't get the blame normally, he does in this case because it's in front of my family and I care about them not being made nervous or uncomfortable about stupid arguments, while he doesn't care. I would never argue with him in front of his family. After the first time I asked him to please not start arguments or bring bad moods/anger in front of my family when we only see them less than 5 days a year. So he knew that embarrassed me but did it anyway. I concede I am a contributing factor which is why I'm asking if IATA.", "eh op isnt just coming here talking about how bad it was, theyre still making their point about twitter! u/Sensitive-Aside-1224 is right there in this. i wouldnt trust its exactly how they say.", "Yeah it was the storming out and getting mad that was upsetting. Before that everyone was having a lively and fun conversation and that turned it completely awkward and embarrassing. He has a bad temper which is why he later apologized for that. The reason I feel it's okay to tell him to leave is because it's actually my house that I bought before we married, and I pay the mortgage not him. Granted it's his home now too and I consider it \"ours\" but he can afford a couple nights hotel room.", ">he doesn't act like this when it's just us, he does this in front of my family specifically\n\nThis seems an oddly specific trigger for this intermittent hectoring habit. Is there some previous awkward history between your family and your partner?", "reddits a cesspool too so you really have no room to talk", "I understand that backing down can seem like letting it happen, but he's unlikely to be able to continue arguing with no opposition. In future, I'd recommend trying to concede and diffuse the situation until the social situation's over, then confront him about it in private to avoid continuing to endanger/frighten whoever's with you.", "Not sure why you are stating your opinions as objective truths.

He doesn't like holiday/family events and isn't the most social person, so he's already starting out in a bad mood and gets easily annoyed or whatever and loses his temper. He does have a bad temper and flips out about tiny minor things every day (like accidentally knocking something over or not being able to find something). The difference is at home, he blows it out and yells and swears and then 5 minutes later is totally over it. So it's not really a big deal and is mostly comical. But you can't exactly act like that at a dinner with elderly parents or cousins that you see once a year. So when he loses it at dinner and shocks everyone into silence I'm left completely mortified and then angry at him afterwards bc he \"ruined\" the night. \n\nWe get along perfectly fine 99% of the time at home. I suppose I talked myself into a head of steam that he was purposely trying to humiliate me in front of my family bc it happened 3 times this year which are all the times we saw my family. But it probably wasn't on purpose. Maybe he should do some relaxation exercises beforehand or something, or I should be more accommodating in social settings. \n\nSome of my \"baggage\" is both my dad and my granddad were bad tempered men who frequently blew up and yelled and scared people at holidays, and their wives spent their whole lives fluttering around them, trying to soothe them and make everything okay. So I've always felt the need to not act like that or back down. However, my technique of not backing down isn't getting any better results than the concede and smoothe things over technique I witnessed.  I suppose a solution could simply be that he stays home and doesn't participate in family events since they're pretty rare. But I don't know if I want to be married to someone who can't just be good humoured and sociable for 5 days a year. We don't have kids so no issue there.

It seems to be more about his mood than the topic. Like one thing I know is to NEVER argue about anything before dinner when he's hangry. I guess I should add family holiday events to that list too.", "This is absolutely possible. He doesn't enjoy big holiday get togethers or visitors that are with us for more than a few days.", "We both use Twitter. I don't care that he uses it and I use it too. I totally see the appeal in scrolling the dumpster fire. Either our use or anyone else's never came up, the argument was purely about whether or not it was a dumpster fire. Which he actually DOES agree on, he's not just saying that to appease me lol I assure you he never does anything to appease me (which is fine, I don't need to be appeased). It's not about Twitter, it's something else. the more I am reading comments, the more I am convinced that the real issue here is just that he hates family holiday events, starts off uncomfortable, and if there's drinking that doesn't help so he just loses his temper more easily when he thinks I'm being annoying. We don't have this type of argument where he gets angry at home, we get along fine and any debates involve teasing and humor. It's something about being in the pressurized family context. \n\nI also probably am more sensitive there bc I don't want my family to think we're crazy or that I'm married to an angry guy, so I get embarrassed. Maybe he's not that different and I just don't notice when he's peevish at home, but it embarrasses me at a holiday dinner where people are on their best behavior.", "Don't worry, we don't and won't.", "I do have the legal right bc it's my house, I bought it before we married and our prenup says it remains mine if we ever split. That said, I actually did not want him to leave, I wanted him to apologize and explain why he keeps doing this and what suggestions he had for fixing it in the future. But that's what we did the last two times and clearly it didn't work to stop it happening again. So after he was ignoring me all day (and took the dogs for a fun hike without asking me to come) I had too long to stew about it and started convincing myself he must be doing it purposely to try to humiliate me in front of my family. Now that I've calmed down I don't think that's true. But I got wound up enough that I asked him to leave and he did not object or say anything, he just got up got his stuff and went.", "Lol see that's the kind of answer that would make both of us laugh. Probably all three TBH.", "For the most part our life is so boring and routine that I don't think it could be said to run on drama \ud83d\ude09. But yeah, we need some kind of game plan or clear rules for these rare holiday/family events to prevent this from replaying. Either that or stop attending together.", "Thank you! I think I'd have a hard time convincing him to go, but after reading all these comments, I'm willing to consider it when I wasn't before.", "But she doesn\u2019t? They both sound draining", "Yeah the Twitter subject is totally irrelevant and neither of us even care about that. The issue is blowing up and causing awkward silences at family/holiday events in the first place. That's not the kind of thing that bothers him, but deeply humiliates me. He is not at all afraid of conflict and will get into arguments with strangers at like the grocery store or in a park, if they do something he doesn't like. In those cases I always apologize and say sorry to try to smooth it over or mediate. But I don't like the idea of having to apologize for him and smooth things over with my family bc I think he just shouldn't act like that on the 5 days a year he's with them.", "Sounds like they both need to be the smartest people in the room\u2026", "There's more to this than I could fit into the character limit. \n\nAfter the first time when he stormed out, I had to have a whole conversation with my relative to calm her down and apologize. She's a retired psychologist so I went through the whole thing with her, had to convince her that he doesn't have PTSD from his service but just has a temper that blows over quickly and then he's totally fine five minutes later. \n\nAfter the guests left, he and I had a LONG conversation where I explained how embarrassing that was for me, and asked him to understand that when I only see my parents every one or two years, I do not want this to be the only thing they see when actually we get along fine most of the time and I don't want them to think he's scary or mean. He isn't, he's just used to a military culture where people yell and display anger and it's NBD. I pointed out that I never do this in front of his family (which he agreed I don't) and that it humiliates me when it happens in front of mine, and I begged him to PLEASE not argue about stupid stuff or get hostile in a way that makes people uncomfortable when we're at family events. Which he said he totally understood and agreed to and apologized both to me and apparently also texted our two guests and apologized to them (I found that out later). \n\nAll seemingly good. But then it happens again and it's like WTF we talked about this. That time I was more upset and when we made up we again had a lengthy conversation, where I tried to dig into why he did it and what made him get hostile or what set him off. He could not come up with any reason and said he didn't know, but promised it would absolutely never happen again. \n\nAnd then it did (granted my brother brought it up but he thought it was funny bc at the time we were joking around about how my dad is basically the dictator of his marriage so it was sort of a related topic). So the third time I just couldn't believe it and bc he didn't speak to me for the next 24 hrs I worked myself up into a boil thinking he either 1. Was doing it purposely to try to hurt or embarrass or fuck with me or something, or 2. Just literally didn't give a shit enough to care if he was embarrassing me. So I asked him to leave rather than sit around a tense and hostile house together. Now that I've calmed down I don't think it was either of those things and I probably overreacted but am also still hurt/angry that he did this repeatedly after we'd had long discussions and he promised not to.", "It's my house I bought it before we were married, and he didn't protest or object to leaving, he just left in silence.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

He\u2019s still an AH even if that is the case, but I think that\u2019s somewhat common for people to be bothered by and adjusting the way you argue might make it better. Because you keeping saying it\u2019s a fact that Twitter is a cesspool, but even if 99% of people agree with you, it\u2019s still opinion and not fact.", "WOW! Even after you, apologized for arguing with everyone responding to your post your off and running again pointing how it's not you that's the problem..... Do you even see what you're typing? Or just arguing because in your eye's someone besides you would be winning? Wow", "Wow lol", "And here you are again arguing about how right you are and how wrong he is.\n\n Arguing with strangers on reddit. \n\n Do you even like your husband?\n\n Everything I've read up to this point screams that you only care about being right. \n\n Sigh.... thats really kinda sad.", "So you're saying that out of the blue he just starts talking about twitter again? Either way nothing you've said so far points to him \"running you down\". He disagrees with your opinion as you do with his. You can agree to disagree. I'm just suggesting you acknowledge his opinion and move on.", "Tough personalities...\nThis is an excuse for being domineering and obnoxious and lacking empathy towards others.\n\nOwn it or stop complaining when it blows up in your face. Both of you.", "I have a feeling your family already knows you\u2019re insufferable in this way. They\u2019ll probably see it as personal growth.", "That ship sailed a long time. In fact, that whole fleet set sail and has come back around.", "So you\u2019d rather make every meal uncomfortable?", "Well... if someone else with vastly different life experiences from him was able to reach his point of view completely independently, surely you can see why his perspective is valid. \n\nYou don't have to agree with him. Just shut up about it for a few hours since you're the one so embarrassed about arguing in front of your family. Think about it this way: if Twitter being a cesspool is such self-apparent truth, then everyone else in the room when you argue surely has strong views about it too. What makes you and your husband the only two children so egotistical and so petty that you they can shut up about it for a few hours but you cant?!", "You did bring it up the first time, which then led to your brother bringing it up later.", "Omg, you even make your living situation a score keeping competition. Why can't you accept you should be supporting eachother anyway you can and realise relationships take teamwork. You both sound like you have to make everything a competition. Why??? It's not really making either of you happy is it?", "I wish you all the best and happiness!!", "Can't you see that that's a problem? I've known plenty of people who have served in the military (LOTS of family & friends) & only the AHs & those who had severe trauma behaved how you're describing. The ones who wanted to be better for *themselves* & their *loved* *ones* put their pride away & got help. They threw away the excuses because they knew it was a problem. Those who didn't see anything wrong with their behavior & had people enable & excuse it away, like you still are, continued said behavior causing people to either cut them out of their lives or they ended up in big trouble. Him not believing in therapy is a red flag as well that's screaming that he doesn't want to confront & fix his issues or doesn't believe that they exist. \n\nYou're afraid that some \"crazy person\" might do something to *him* without realizing that *he* IS a crazy person to others when he does what he does. Stop excusing & rationalizing his behavior. Things aren't going to get better or change if you don't start holding him accountable & expecting him to get help. \n\nWhile *you* may accept his \"bluntness\" it WILL get him hurt or in big trouble one day. Trust me, your family sees him for what he is & it's time for you to see & admit it, too. None of this is good or healthy. Excusing it with him serving isn't helping him either. It's just allowing him to continue & excuse it himself without doing something to fix it.", "From the title alone, I thought the post was going to be about Reddit.", "It\u2019s why we\u2019re here isn\u2019t it?", "How do you signal that you want to stop without upsetting the other? My partner has that when we are alone. Normally we agree in most things but if i disagree with jim he tends to go on long monologs and get more and more upset. I tried a few times to tell him to leave the topic but he refuses or gets really upset. After a couple of times asking to stop the only way i got to get away is by clearing the table and going to the kitchen but that makes him very upset as well.\n\nHe wont even accept to stop if we are getting angry over something personal (like who takes out the garbage idk) and i tell him that i want to stop talking about it because i am getting upset and want to talk about it later. Last time he kept yelling even after i asked him twice to stop.", "[removed]", "I could I guess. I think it might offend him if I told him to just stay home. He never objects to going or says he doesn't want to, we both feel a similar sense of family obligation that showing up to events you're invited to is just the right thing to do. So it's like a duty for him but not one he enjoys. I guess I could ask and see what he thinks.", "You may be right. It it honestly hard for me to even imagine he has any insecurities at all bc he's very stoic (other than the brief melt downs) and always seems supremely confident and assured of himself. But I there could be something under there.", "Yeah she pretty much described it perfectly. Thanks for the link.", "I will try.  I have this instinct to reward the kind of behavior you want more of and push back on the behavior you don't. Basic incentives, etc. But obviously that isn't working out too well so I will try and see what happens, even though it will be hard. \n\nNow that I think about it, maybe he gets angry bc he feels ganged up on, because usually a female family member starts off taking my side, while it's still playful and before he gets mad and people get quiet. But idk bc we have a friend couple and whenever we hang out we always get into a rollicking big debate/argument and the wife is even more feisty and argumentative than me, and that never bothers him and it stays humorous and fun. It could be he just doesn't like my family!", "He was drinking the first two times. Not the third. Though the third time it did end pretty quickly (I was mad at him after specifically because I couldn't believe he did it three times in a row and didn't apologize). I wouldn't say he was belligerently drunk. More like uninhibited after 3 drinks or so. So maybe not thinking as clearly/more quick to lose his temper. \n\nTo be clear, he's not an alcoholic. These were all special events/gatherings so he was imbibing more than normal.", "you really love twitter, huh?", "Facebook also has a vibrant community of mentally ill queer shitposters lol", "Once he gets hostile, he does run me down as part of his arguments. Like calls me names etc.", "Jeez, mob mentality is really going on in this comment thread. I\u2019m going to get downvoted but I don\u2019t care, she\u2019s correcting your incorrect assumptions, she has every right to do that.

I will try to talk to him about it, thank you.", "Here's a quick question: why do you care that he gets upset when he clearly doesn't care that his behavior makes you upset?", "Yikes - that he\u2019s not willing to stop and gets so upset with you (yells at you and locks himself in the bedroom for hours) is really unhealthy. It would have me reconsidering the relationship and I would have a hard time staying through that type of mistreatment. You have to be able to fight fair with your partner.\n\nHave you tried establishing a code word/phrase where you both agree to drop it and say nothing else about the topic? That works for a lot of people\u2026but your partner sounds over the top.
