Or do dishes, laundry, or any of the routine things that need to be done as part of normal life.\n\nYou know why?  Because they are VERY EASY.  Laundry can be learned in 5 minutes.  Sure, maybe once or twice you'll make a mistake, put a brand new red shirt in with other things, or wash a dry clean only thing, but whatever, that's part of it.\n\nDishes are the same, if you can't figure out how to do dishes on your own, you are either astonishingly stupid, or you're just pretending so you don't have to do them.\n\nCooking is a *slightly* different thing, because there's a huge range of capabilities there.  But when we talk about home cooking, again, the basics are VERY EASY.  Any adult should be able to make grilled cheese and tomato soup.  Or pancakes.  Or put a pre-made lasagna in the oven and toast up a loaf of french bread with butter.  Or any of a BILLION ways you can type \"easy way to cook broccoli\" or whatever into google.  There are a ton of idiot proof, super easy things to cook, where you do not need ANYONE to teach you.\n\nSure, you won't be a 5 star chef overnight.  But saying \"I can't cook\" because you aren't going to immediately be a gourmet chef is like refusing to use a screwdriver to open the battery compartment on some gadget because you can't build a house.  \n\nSo if an adult ever says \"I don't know how to do that\" when it's about a basic home task, that really just means \"I don't WANT to do that, and I want YOU to do it for me.\"", "nta!!! never think ur in the wrong for not wanting to teach!! teaching isn\u2019t free anyway", "NTA\n\nBut if he hasn't learned yet, he'll never learn.

Thing is, that dynamic is extremely hard to get out of once you become the partner who knows how to do things and teaches the other. In our case, there weren't as many easily accessed things for self learning. We grew up in a very rural area and didn't have smart phones and easy Internet access. If that had been the case, I would have been far less inclined to play the role I did.\n\nWe made it through but it definitely affected us for a good chunk of our early twenties. Because it becomes a default. It's human nature to see someone as a voice of authority once we put them in that role and for a long time, his reflex was to ask me how something gets done even when that thing was completely new to me too.\n\nHe just assumed and expected my competence at everything and would defer to me even when it was something I also had to figure out.

It sounds like everything was done for him and that his incompetence was enabled, so maybe he wasn\u2019t even taught how to learn. \n\nHow hard would it be to just sit down with him and go over some of the basics, or buy him a cooking skills book. If he doesn\u2019t make the effort after that then that\u2019s on him. If there was something he knew how to do that you needed to learn, would you not be upset that he wouldn\u2019t help you?", "You're the asshole. What happens the first time there is something you don't know how to do and ask for his help? Or what if there is something heavy to carry or something high up on a shelf? If you give you the same energy that you're giving him you'd call him an asshole for refusing.\n\nHe's actually taking an interest in cooking the way you cook, and your response is to tell him to go fuck himself, basically. Quite honestly you are the one who sounds entitled and there's definitely some sort of mental block going on. Frankly I think the red flag you showed is a good warning for him to think about this relationship and how it will probably end badly.", "ESH. Honestly just seems like he\u2019s a typical young male who doesn\u2019t quite know how to fend for himself yet. If you don\u2019t want to deal with that, that\u2019s your choice.

He needs to grow up.", "NTA, your boyfriend is showing a lot of red flags. It is not your job to teach him basic life skills, cooking, and cleaning. Part of having children and being a parent is teaching them how to be an adult and take care of themselves. His parents failed in that. My kids, both boy and girl, were taught how to cook and clean, plan a budget, sew a button, basic home maintenance and before they got behind the wheel to learn how to drive, they had to learn how to change a tire, check the fluids, basic car stuff. These are basic things adults need to know. Your boyfriend needs to take adulting 101 and learn to be self sufficient.", "NTA.  You were clear with him and he chose to ignore you.

That's what couples do.\" - sorry no that is NOT what couples do. If you are adults and you choose to move in with each other, you should already know how to do basic tasks to live life, not expect someone else to show you how to do it. \n\nYou need to kick him to the curb - you're by no means an AH for telling him to man up, he's the AH for expecting you to show you what he should already know how to do", "NTA \n\nTeaching him to cook is still a chore.

His parents have done him no favours and he has grown up seeing these tasks as 'womens work'. It's more likeky that he will deliberately sabotage attempts to teach him in the hope that you take over all of the household tasks out of frustration. You are right, it will be no fun for you attempting to teach him to do things that he should have learned at home.\nHowever,  it's not completely hopeless. Set home management criteria that he needs to achieve before you will share a home with him, reassure him that the goal is fair division of tasks rather than anyone being a servant.

Eating takeout and eating fruit snacks???\n\nSide note, I barely knew how to cook when I left home. My mom hated it and never wanted help because when someone is learning to cook they\u2019re slow and messy. So, I didn\u2019t really want to be there and she didn\u2019t really want me there, so she taught me very little.\n\nMy dad wasn\u2019t allowed to cook because he \u201cdid it wrong\u201d in my mom\u2019s eyes, so he taught me to cook breakfast before she got up on the weekends. To be fair he also tried to put away dishes that still had food on them after going through the dishwasher, so they both had issues.\n\nSo I watched, and used the internet. My poor husband got a lot of eggs and bacon while I learned (he was on nights and worked more hours so I cooked most of the time).

Why not try it together before you move in?\n\nHaving said that, you may have been a bit harsh with him, no one likes being condescended to and calling him a kid is condescending.

Plus that should have been practiced when he went to college. My daughter knew how to cook, clean, bake and do laundry from 9 on. She was fully prepared for college and had to teach some of the guys in her dorm how to do laundry. \n\nHe could have simply asked mom and dad teach him\u2026would have been a fantastic surprise for OP. When I was getting married, our nephew (9) asked him mom to teach him how to dance. He wanted to be able to join in being part of the wedding party. Our flower girl was pleasantly surprised. My nephew is a great kid and I love him but I love him even more for that\u2026taking the initiative at 9. \n\nNot the OP\u2019s job to teach him nor be his maid. \n\nNTA OP\u2026he\u2019s a full grown man.", "Yep, sorry boys. \nThere's no fucking excuse anymore.\n\nLook up a \"how to\" on the internet. You're capable.\n\nLet's us know when you're prepared to be a functioning, worthy partner.", "I also don't think there is really a need for someone to \"teach\" you to cook. You can watch youtube videos on kitchen skills if you need.\n\nBut it's basically pick a recipe and follow it.\n\nIf a 10 yr old can do it, so can he.", "i do not understand this guy. does he think that women think it\u2019s sexy to be incompetent and immature? does he think op\u2019s dream in life is to mother a grown man, from the time his actual mother gave up on him till the day he dies? nta, i would put a very tight timeline on this, cause if he\u2019s not growm up by now it may just never happen. don\u2019t waste too much time on this guy, op.", "Compromise is part of having a relationship. Waiting for someone who is so perfect nothing ever has to be negotiated means living alone forever.", "He's had 8 years as an adult to learn.\n\nHe's had three years of OP clearly telling him that she would not teach him and that he needs to figure it out before moving in together.", "yeah, but if they're an adult, they should have enough of an adults self sufficiency to be able to make themselves food or do their own laundry. Or at least the intent to learn how. there's YouTube, cook books, any number of other options than just leaving the job up to their significant other to teach them. \n\nEven if it's not their fault, it's still their responsibility to be a contributing member of the relationship.", "And he can watch YouTube, Tiktok or pick up a cookbook. If he\u2019s willing to learn, he should learn on his OWN instead of expecting his partner to teach him.", "\"He said I was pestering him and wanted him to be my servant\" when told he needs to learn to cook and Clean Up After HIMSELF! Hello\ud83d\udc4b that sounds pretty sexist to me. If he doesn't clean up after himself when they move in together, who the heck do you think is going to do it, his Mommy?", "> Laundry he relies on his mom and sister.\n\nI am raising a son. I recognize that I'm currently all talk, because he is two and doing his laundry is a sisyphean task taking up approximately 5% of my total waking time, but I have no intention of doing his laundry past...middle school? I refuse to send my child into adulthood thinking chores just magically do themselves. Like if I am regularly doing my adult son's laundry, we have fucked up as parents.", ">drive and drink alcohol\n\nHopefully not at the same time.", "His mother is likely the reason for his incompetence. My brothers know how to do household tasks, because my mom made sure that they did them.", "He\u2019ll drain her finances? What about this post even got into finances? How do you know? What if her BF makes 3x what she does? \n\nYou don\u2019t have any clue lmao. Some of these comments are just projecting people projecting shitty situations they had on everyone else.", "I\u2019m willing to bet his mother has never asked him to do a single thing. It\u2019s a parenting issue. \n\nYou either help him or break up with him.", "But if splitting the cooking is important to this young woman and she's important to him it's not hard for him to learn. \n\nMy husband is a dreadful cook but when he does I'm always grateful. I was sick the other day and he offered to cook. I said I'd planned to do meatballs and sent him the recipe. His dismay on going to the fridge and finding minced beef and not pre-prepared meatballs! However he got stuck in and they were perfect! He probably fits the profile of your example except that he's frugal and would rather eat at home.", "Look, it's not about recipes or who is good at what. It's the fact he had three years, 2 of which he lived with his parents and never tried to learn to cook. If he needed a teacher, he could have learned from his mom. The fact he never tried and waited for me to teach him is my problem.", "She didn't say he had to be equally good. Or even like it.  Just that he had to know how to do it. He's not even willing to get to that point in the last few years.", "IT'S NOT HER JOB. I get it, but if he's not complete asshole they could transform it to some positive activity. People can't learn from each other?", "I learned how to change my cars oil via Tiktok.  There\u2019s plenty of resources to teach yourself basic life skills.", "That\u2019s what happens when guys have a mommy who will do anything for them. Even if he\u2019s 26, he\u2019s not really an adult. He hasn\u2019t had to do anything for himself. \n\nOP should try and teach him before they move in together, if he wants to learn and he\u2019s willing to that shouldn\u2019t be a problem for either side. If he makes excuses, and isn\u2019t willing to do anything, break up with him.", "I\u2019m guessing he doesn\u2019t even know how to boil water. If OP wants to be with this guy, it doesnt hurt to teach him a few basic meals and give him a head start. It doesn\u2019t hurt her whatsoever, and maybe it becomes an activity they like to do with each other. \n\nPeople just need a kick in the pants to get started sometimes. It doesn\u2019t sound like BF will take the initiative to do something like that on his own and maybe it\u2019s daunting for him. \n\nOP can help him, or break up with him. She wouldn\u2019t be an AH either way. But, you have to be willing to work with a guy like this if you want to be with him.", "It gets better, I promise! \n\nWhen my oldest son was 2 he enjoyed scooping litter from the litter box into my clean baskets of laundry\u2026 but now my sons are 9 and 7 and they handle their own laundry, are responsible for daily chores and enjoy making lunch.", "My son just went to college. He's been doing his own laundry and cooking his own meals (after and between meals I make, because he always needs more!) for at least 4 years. I feel good knowing he can do at least those 2 very basic things. Now cleaning his room... not sure how that is going.", ">we have fucked up as parents.\n\nTBH most of my family have fucked up as parents. My grandmother was not the cleanest women and she has passed that lovely trait down to her children/ grandchildren. My Aunt (cousins mother) could do with a good course in cleaning and cooking. She did teach my cousin how to order takeaways. But their cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nEdit: spelling", "No, thankfully not. He walks to the pub or gets a taxi. But he does spend large amounts of his time ordering beer", "Sure.  And that is why I said I think no one is an asshole, they just have different priorities.  For him, cooking isn't a priority.  That doesn't make him an asshole.  \n\nIn reality, I wouldn't move in with a woman who couldn't cook either.   But I don't think it would make her an asshole because she didn't care to learn.", "I taught my husband to cook. I don\u2019t get the issue. \n\nYTA", "How about you get his contact information from\nOP and teach him yourself.", "I mean to be clear I think we all fuck up as parents in one way or another - lord knows I'm not perfect. But not teaching your child the basics of 'adulting' seems like relatively low-hanging fruit.", "Teaching someone how to cook a few recipes is one thing.   Sounds like he has never made himself a meal.   The issue is too many men don't want to learn and he has shown no interest in doing the least to take care of himself.", "I\u2019m not the one who chose to date him for 3 years despite knowing this information lmao"]}
