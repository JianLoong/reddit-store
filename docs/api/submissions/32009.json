A\u2019s mum passed away when she was little so it\u2019s just her and her dad. Since he has started dating his girlfriend (we\u2019ll call her C) A\u2019s needs have been pushed to the side a little and he\u2019s just not noticed that A has been struggling. She\u2019s doing better now after getting the help she needed.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, A\u2019s hair has been extremely matted as it had not been brushed for months. A had been hiding her hair under hats and hoods at home and trying to disguise it at school in buns. She stayed over at the weekend and I only found out about her hair when they came downstairs after getting a comb stuck in A\u2019s hair trying to fix it. I comforted A as she was ashamed about her hair but had hoped that she and my daughter could fix it. My daughter convinced her to tell me about it as she had been scared to say anything to anyone as she thought she would be judged as her dad\u2019s girlfriend has made comments about her appearance when she was going through her health issues. When A was going through her issues, I made it clear to her and my daughter that our home is a judgement free zone and if she ever wanted to come to me or my husband for help then she would get it. A then asked for help detangling her hair. So that\u2019s what I did. We put on some films and worked on detangling A\u2019s hair. It took hours, but it was doable.\r  \n\r  \nWhen A went home on Sunday, her hair was completely detangled and neatly braided into two dutch braids. She was happy and thanked me for helping with her hair. Then Monday I got an angry phone call from C because she was meant to be taking A to get her hair cut due to how matted her hair was. Apparently C and A\u2019s dad had noticed how bad it was and C had told me that she would get it sorted. C is mad because the salon they were going to had charged her a cancellation fee for cancelling the day of the appointment. C wants me to pay her back for the cancellation fee as it\u2019s my fault for fixing A\u2019s hair when they were going to get it cut out. I told her that I wouldn\u2019t be paying it, I just did the right thing by A instead of going to the extreme option straight away. C then said that A was no longer allowed to be friends with my daughter and they would sue me for the cancellation fee. It was \u00a360 (half the cost of the cut).\r  \nMy daughter told me that A knew about C wanting to cut her hair and A didn\u2019t want the hair cut which is why she went to my daughter for help. A like my own daughters has long hair, so cutting the matted hair out would have meant her losing well over half of the length of her hair. \n\n\r  \nAITA for brushing out A\u2019s hair so she avoided getting a drastic cut.", "created_utc": 1701297605, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18729yz/aita_for_brushing_my_daughters_friends_extremely/", "score": 2954, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There was no reason to cancel the appointment since he hair would still need a trim to take off the dead ends.

No matter which route they went the cost would've been more than the cancelation fee.

Long hair can often be a huge part of a teen girl's self image and relationship with their looks.

Dad needs to start thinking with priority just Willy the One-Eyed Wonder Worm and make his daughter his priority.\n\nThank you for looking after A. You're a good bonus mom.", "NTA - in fact, you are the opposite, you are an angel who walks the earth!", "Nta they can consider the cancelation your fee for fixing her hair and letting them be friends again free from adult bs or they can go ahead and sue. Let them tell a judge how much they neglect poor A.", "NTA\n\nWhat you did was a kindness.\n\nBut she's 13 years old. Why wasn't she combing or brushing her own hair? I can't imagine my parents brushing my hair at age 13. Children have normally been shampooing and combing / brushing their own hair for years at that age.\n\nYou mentioned health issues. Was she so depressed that she ignored her hygiene for months?", "NTA. Honestly, you\u2019re an angel. I suffer from bipolar disorder and severe anxiety. I\u2019ve also spent most of my adult life with agoraphobia. As a result, my personal hygiene has taken the backseat several times. During one of my worst depressive episodes, I neglected my hair for *months.* It ended up in a giant mat on top of my head that I desperately tried to hide with bandannas and hoods because hats no longer fit over the mass of hair. I was beyond ashamed and embarrassed. And those feelings just further fueled my depression. When I inevitably swung into a manic state, I hacked the mat off in an emotionally charged fit. What came off can only be described as a helmet of hair. I managed to salvage maybe 2-4 inches of hair around my entire head and my boyfriend (now husband) sat down and tidied up my hair and cut it into a wonderful style. Obviously, I told myself that I\u2019d never let that happen again but as bipolar disorder proves time and time again, the depressive episodes will always return. While my hair never got to the point of being a literal helmet again, it\u2019s definitely gotten to a matted state several times. I\u2019m usually able to detangle it with a lot of patience and arm strength. But sometimes it\u2019s just easier to admit defeat and chop it off. The last time I had to cut off a large portion of my hair was actually this past March. But I\u2019ve also found that as I\u2019m getting older, my hair doesn\u2019t grow as fast as it used to. So even though it\u2019s been almost a year, it only just got long enough for a short ponytail within the last two or so months. \n\nI share all of this because I personally know how awful it feels to be in that position. You feel embarrassed, ashamed, ugly, and like a disappointment. I just wish I had someone to confide in and ask for help, particularly a motherly figure like yourself who would assure me that I wouldn\u2019t be judged. My own mother was judgy about my appearance even before my hair matted so I made sure to keep it hidden from her and while my boyfriend was caring and helpful, it just wasn\u2019t something that I felt I could come to him and ask for help with. I\u2019ve come across a couple stories and videos of hairdressers spending hours detangling the hair of young women and girls who are dealing with depression or other mental health issues and it always brings a tear to my eyes and happiness to my heart. When you\u2019re dealing with any kind of health issue, mental or physical, and your personal care gets neglected, the biggest thing you need is someone on your side who will help you and not judge you for your situation. So thank you for being the caring adult and motherly figure that this young lady needed. Just make sure to tell her that you are proud of her for asking you for help because you understand how hard it can be to admit that you need it. Also tell her that she can come to you for any other help she may need. Clearly she trusts you. Make sure she has your contact information, whether it\u2019s a phone number, email, or even social media account, so she can reach out to you if she needs help. Especially if it\u2019s something that she isn\u2019t able to or just isn\u2019t comfortable bringing to her dad or C. \n\nAs for C, why couldn\u2019t she still take A to the salon for a regular haircut/trim? Why did the appointment have to be cancelled? Whenever my matted hair was eventually brushed out, the ends were so damaged from the matting and detangling that it desperately needed some tlc and a trim. She could have just kept the appointment and instead of having it be a full cut, it could have been used for a trim and style. So the fact that C cancelled the appointment completely is her own fault and you aren\u2019t the least bit responsible. Let her try and sue you. I highly doubt that it would go anywhere. Plus, I would think that the legal fees would end up costing more than the cost of the cancellation that she\u2019s demanding so it\u2019s honestly a major waste of time and effort. And like many others have said, suing you opens C (and the dad) to being investigated for child neglect. It could end up being a messy situation for A so again, make sure she has your contact information and knows to reach out to you. \n\nRegardless of what happens, you did the right thing.", "NTA. The parents are the AHs. It was important to your daughter's friend to not have her hair cut and her parents were not going to respect her wishes or help her.\n\nA personal anecdote: When my daughter was 13, she went through a deep depressive episode and stopped caring for her hair. She didn't tell us about her hair, and like your daughter's friend, my daughter hid her hair under hats and hoods, and kept it wrapped in a bun. At that point, her hair was long enough to be halfway down her back. \n\nFinally, I asked her to let me see her hair and she immediately burst into tears. She said she had been depressed and wasn't caring for her hair properly, and had been hiding her hair from me because she was worried I would be upset with her for letting it get so bad and thought I would make her cut it all off. I wouldn't have been upset; had I known she was struggling like that, I would have gotten her the help she needed.\n\nWhen I took her hair down out of the bun, I was horrified to discover it had knotted into 3 completely matted sections. Honestly I felt utterly defeated just looking at it. But we got to work on getting that mess detangled. We went through a whole bottle of detangler and a whole bottle of conditioner trying to get her hair sorted.\n\nIt took 7 hours on a Friday, 7 hours on a Saturday, and then probably 3 hours on that Sunday before I finally told her that I had done as much as I could, but it was time to see a hairdresser to see how much could be salvaged. I had made great progress, but I was tired and her scalp was sore.\n\nWe went to the salon and I explained the situation and let the stylist know that we wanted to salvage as much length as possible. My daughter came away with a cut that was around shoulder length, very flattering, and she remarked later with a giggle that it was so much easier care for now and that she should have gotten it cut a long time ago(!). We talked about that event every once in a while until she died.\n\nLong story longer, you gave your daughter's friend a tremendous gift and I expect she will remember it for a very long time. Thank you, OP.", "NTA.\n\nAlso, where in God's name did they have A. booked in that \u00a360 was the cancellation fee for the hairdresser?  Was Vidal Sassoon himself going to cut it?\n\nI haven't lived in the UK for a while, and I know inflation is wild right now, but even with my hair its longest getting it cut has never cost me that much, I dread to think how much the place charges if they actually do the cut.", "NTA, but tread carefully.

I was her when I was young, and I used to cry so much because my hair would get so matted but my mom wouldn't do anything about it. She never let me cut my hair either so it was down to the floor until I was 12 when my grandma set up a secret hair appointment and I got 2 1/2 feet of hair chopped off. I have regretted it ever since. \n\nMy aunt used to brush my hair so it wouldn't mat but when she died it turned into a mess because my mom was negligent. My dad tried his best because my curly hair comes from him, but he hated hurting me. My hair used to break all sorts of brushes, and eat bristles for breakfast.

That is a wonderful accomplishment that many struggle to do, and I applaud you.", "NTA, correct me if I am wrong but didn't you really save C money?

Like, maybe you could have a chat with dad that he's the person you should talk to about parenting decisions/things between the kids? So that you can shut C down when you need to.

I'm betting she just doesn't know how to take care of her hair as it sounds like there is much parenting going on at home. \n\nMaybe a little advice on how to wash - not twirling and scrubbing it into a nest on your head. Using the right shampoo for her type of hair and conditioner to make it easier to comb out after showering. Wide tooth comb for detangle from the ends of the hair upwards toward the root, is gentler, less painful and causes less breakage to the hair. Breakage will create tangles. Washing it every other day, but brush it daily. Maybe a silk sleeping bonnet. This helps keep hair from tangling while sleeping.", "NTA.

C and the dad are awful, letting it go that long and then just opting to get it cut instead of taking a bit of time to fix it.  I'm guessing C was planning on having it cut super short, or even shaved.  I hope the salon was the kind that would intervene and try to convince her to fix it rather than chop it.

Severe matting like that suggests she's so mentally or physically unwell that she can't cope with such a basic task (medical neglect), or she's being denied basic hygiene products like a hairbrush (straight up abuse).\n\nThis is hinky as hell.", "Quite", "Tbh I doubt that CPS will take the kid, unless its extreme, unfortunely. But It will defiently affect the friendship.", "In the uk it\u2019s the NSPCC", "It's social service in the UK. They'll half arse investigate it as theyre overwhelmed. Theyll check none of the kids are on a database for family of concern or check no concerns from school or GP then close the case.", "Even worse for C is that cutting someone's hair without their consent is assault and battery.", "I was thinking this, too. She probably still needs a trim, regardless.", "She's 13. You try to ban her from her friends house where she feels safe and shes gonna run away from home to there", "At 13 in the UK kids are in the equivalent of a second year of high school. Very different level of supervision and if A has been showering and wearing clean clothes and has her hair up, it won't ping a teacher the same way it might in elementary. \n\n13 is a tough age because often times they're super private and parents are not providing physical hygiene care. If A's parents reacted appropriately to OP's help, I wouldn't even say they were the assholes, just adults not realizing how much hands on help their teen required.", "OP says the kid has been disguising it pretty well.", "I'm from the Netherlands, but I've been privy to my UK friend's struggles with social services, and it's appalling.\nThey insisted on her ex being allowed unsupervised access to their kid despite admitting in court he uses military discipline tactics on his other (very young) kid. At the same time my friend is struggling massively with both her physical and mental health, causing her to be unable to work. Social has done nothing but criticise and berate her. The very few workers willing to actually help had to quit their jobs because they couldn't take the mental strain themselves anymore. Either that or they were removed from my friend's case by higher ups.\n\nI'm not saying Dutch services are better, in fact they probably aren't.", "right they should be paying op for the effort to fix the matting if anything", "She had some kind of health issues. I assume she wasn't physically able to brush her hair and needed someone to do it for her...and no one did and then it was so bad she couldn't handle it herself anymore.", "That was my first thought!! This child should be able to brush her own hair. Even if she wasn't taught to work up from the ends and all the dimness, she could figure out how to comb or brush her hair enough to go out. Whole thing seems fake.", "I dont completely agree. Yes i did my daily hairstyle when i was 13 but i remember once a week my mum would give me proper brushing (she used some hair oil and detangled the bits i missed like at the nape of my neck). And i have fine hair, maybe A has thick hair that are more difficult to manage.", "Exactly! This girl deserves a nice wash and blow out in a salon, to be pampered and remember what it\u2019s like to love yourself and love your hair. They should have kept the appointment.", "This was where my mind went.", "100% saw it as C trying to punish and alienate A.\n\nWhy isn't A's dad the one who's involved? In fact, why don't you refuse to talk to C and only talk to A's dad?", "Oh, I absolutely assumed that was at least part of why the gf was so angry.", "This is 100% the vide I got. I may be over sensitive- my father had girlfriends and a wife who loved to humiliate me and my sister. They seemed to honestly enjoy any discomfort or embarrassment I experienced.", ">Yes, that is logical, but\u2026 the cynic in me is wondering whether she was LOOKING FORWARD to putting the child through the trauma of that cut, and is now pissed that the plan was ruined. I don\u2019t think this is about finances at all. \n\nRight? If this was about finances, OP actually saved the girlfriend the rest of the cost of the cut.", "I agree completely, this was exactly my thought. She sounds incredibly cruel.", "Right, this screams that that c wanted to inflict a punishment on the child and not help or support her because they could have kept the appointment and given her a nice experience of being taken care of.", "Especially since her ends were probably very damaged, she absolutely could have used a nice trim to clean up her hair without making it punitive. Cancelling day of is just another way to take it out on the girl. I've had my hair go \"depression rat nest\" mode before, I have fine hair so it only takes a few days to get bad, and it definitely damages the ends. Poor kid.", "The salon almost definitely has a system where you provide a credit card when you book and the late fee is charged in the system. So she probably already paid the late fee.", "The kid (A) has medical issues on top of all of this? Then yes, maybe a call to social services *is* in A's best interest. WTF. How is her dad allowing this to happen??", "Except for C, who apparently thinks not getting to force a traumatic haircut on A is an unacceptable outcome.", "Technically OP saved them many hundreds of dollars. Getting mats combed out in a salon is expensive", "I'm glad they didn't comb it out because people who don't care combing problematic hair is very painful and result in a lot of hair loss. my own mom who combed my -not even that- curly hair which she deemed problematic caused a lot of pain. when i started the curly girl method -in my thirties, completely independent from her since my twenties- she would berate me and say my hair was unkempt. She also kept my hair extremely short and this was I guess like a punishment for wanting to keep it longer. She of course would also make fun of me for being boyish unlike herself, who she spent hours and hours and lots of money to keep well dressed and hair all made up all the time.", "I kind of doubt paying the money is going to patch things up. C will find some other reason to keep them apart, or complain about OP's involvement in A's life if they stay in touch. OP has opened herself up to issues now, and the only way to resolve them is to be firm with C and A's dad about how she'll stand up for her child and A and their friendship.", "If he was any sort of father, this wouldn't have happened in the first place. I wouldn't count on him for any kind of support.", "I'm pretty sure they were going to cut it pretty short, to the level it wouldn't matter.", "Yup.  My dad did a similar thing when I was the same age; it was just me and him until he got a GF (while still married to my mother) and deserted me constantly to just disappear.  I had no idea at the time that he was having an affair, just that we lived in a neighbourhood that was scary AF and I was always left alone to cope.  \n\n\nBad dad, no biscuit!", "OP said the child had been having some medical issues.", "I got a huge knot/matte of hair when I was around that age. I had recently moved in with my dad after my mom was deemed an unhealthy person to be around. All my sis and I had were our clothes and that was pretty much it. My dad had plain combs, and like [boar-bristle brushes](https://www.parkershaving.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/HAIRBRUSH1.jpg). Those are fine for short hair like men usually have, but not for long, fairly fine hair that my sister and I had at the time. I didn't like combs because they would snag, so I would try to just use the boar-bristle brush. Because my hair was so fine, it couldn't get through to the bottom of my hair close to my neck.\n\nMy stepmom (god bless, she's the best parent I had out of all of them) saw me trying to sneak a pair of scissors into the bathroom to cut it out. She stopped me and helped me comb it out, and then reamed my dad a new one for not having  brushes that would cope with my and my sister's hair.", "you were truly so nice! NTA. I would have done the same thing, the other parents are the issue.", "I don\u2019t think they will take the child, but they will investigate why a \u201cstep mom\u201d is sueing someone for brushing the child\u2019s hair. Then if they do investigate, dad & girlfriend/stepmom will be more upset and start treating the child worse.", "For a really good reason though. As sad as it is, that sort of neglect is at the bottom of the list that CPS has to worry about.", "From what I\u2019ve witnessed, cps takes kids from the easy cases and leaves the extreme cases of abuse (both my husband and ex were severely abused, visited and ignored multiple times - they were both extremely emaciated among other numerous horrors) kinda wild to see what they will and will not accept.\n\nedited for typos, and to add absolutely NTA \u2764\ufe0f", "But they will send someone who will do wellness checks, which helps too", "They don\u2019t need to take her to make their lives hell. Ijs", "Yeah, unless the girlfriend was trying to force her into a short cut for no reason, a good trim and some styling would probably go a long way to making her feel even better about herself and would be a nice reward for being brave enough to ask for help.", "Depending on how bad her hair was, a good hairstylist or the like could do a world of wonder to help it recover. Split ends, for example.", "If I was A (kiddo), I don\u2019t think I would have trusted C (dad\u2019s girlfriend) to help me get the haircut I wanted vs telling the hair dresser what she wanted.

Sad, but some parents try to punish kids with their hair. \u2639\ufe0f", "As someone who used to work with them not even I want to call crown prosecution", "Because the King will hear of this!", "It can only be disguised so much.", "I missed that- I can understand why she would need extra assistance now.", "Yep, they should have.  But if they were the type of people who were going to do that, they wouldn't have let her hair get into that state in the first place.", "I suspect C is jealous of A, which is stupid, but not unheard of.", "If OP explains the situation the salon may willing & able to issue a partial refund on the card and take her payment", "The salon plan was to whack it all off. C is a monster.  NTA. I\u2019m not even sure paying the cancellation fee would keep C from trying to keep A from seeing you and your daughter. She wants to control this girl, not take care of her. If it would help and you can afford it, maybe. But she\u2019d likely find something else to kick up a fuss about when her own neglect of this poor kid is noticed by someone else.", "Agreed \u2014 the real issue is that C is embarrassed that OP saw how poorly they had cared for A and is looking for an excuse to be mad and cut OP out so they don\u2019t have to confront that embarrassment. \n\nYour solution is better.", "that got to the point because Dad was neglecting in favor of GF!", "Blessings on your stepmother.  I'm sorry you went through that.", "Not even stepmom, just girlfriend", "Yeah but there is a difference though between it being something they have to investigate and literally bringing it to a judge.", "I've seen similar first-hand. I wish your husband (and you, of course) nothing but the very best.", "neglect is often overlooked as a form of abuse, even though its the most common type of abuse", "Oh this. I second this. Maybe they cancelled so they didn't have to pay and just scapegoated the cool mom. It's sound like guilt resent but might just be me.", "Social Services..", "Now I want to know what Crown Protection does...", "any awful stories about them?", "I\u2019m sure they knew, it was likely commentary on how the post was clearly in the UK using \u00a3 for currency and people still use US abbreviations and departments in their comments because the comments always default to USA which is annoying when the post indicates otherwise.\n\nEdit: yall, I was just explaining why I thought the previous comment might have been sarcasm.\n\nI do not need 1000000 dissertations on why you all default everything to the US, *I literally don\u2019t care*. I try to spend little time thinking about your country.", "This depends on the state.

Bringing cash will save her money.", "Thank you! Honestly it was a rough time for everybody, I dont blame my dad for not being the most attentive at the time.

I'm in my 30's now but we still keep in touch, more regularly than my other parents hahaha", "Crown prosecution. They're the lawyers that prosecute criminal offences. \n\nIdk what they equivalent in the US is? Maybe state attorney?", "Well they wanted a statement from a police dog.  \n\nGoogle PD Peach if you want a giggle.", "Their location isn't in the post.\n\nAlso, I don't see why that matters... I just translated an acronym - one that is very common on this sub because Americans tend to assume America unless told otherwise. I also included the Canadian acronym. But sure, let's add SS (not German) in as well.", "No, it\u2019s the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).", "People comment from the things they know. Most people living in the US don't know all the relevant acronyms for other countries because there is absolutely zero reason to under normal circumstances. People from other countries do the same type of thing because, again, people can only speak to what they know. We're people, not narrators.\n\nSorry that people missed a currency symbol and the use of \"mum\", but let's not pretend like people stare for hours at each individual character in a reddit post before commenting. This is a social media platform, not a standardized test", "I think it's more that the US term for the social service that protects children from abuse is referred to as CPS. That's even if the local acronym is different. Most people just consider the initialism to be representative of the concept of children's social services, since there are so many disparate and disconnected agencies over here with a wide variety of titles.\n\nEssentially this is the equivalent of saying the back of the car is the trunk, even if the story is set in the UK and you refer to it as the boot.", "No, comments default to whatever country the person commenting is from. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily know social services in the UK is your version of CPS. Social services in the US runs everything from SSI, elder abuse prevention, welfare, child protection agencies etc. Even in the states, different states have different names. But within the context of this conversation, most reasonable people would recognize someone saying CPS, CFS, DCF or social services would all refer to a government agency pertaining to child welfare.", "It's not even uniform in the US (for example, in New Jersey it is called DYFS, Division of Youth & Family Services) but no need to get shirty about it. We can't call it what you want if you don't tell us the actual name. You know, like when people call us \"USians\" without asking even though that's not our national name. It sucks, right?", "Boo hoo", "Yeah considering she is just a girlfriend and she is cutting out A's friends and threatening to sue? The lady sounds psycho. Fits the bill.  \nThe dad needs to grow a pair here.  \nAnyways, I think you are all right. Hope we're wrong though.", "That\u2019s actually incredibly cheap if it required dematting to even cut it. A lot of salons will charge like $100 an hour minimum to demat hair.", "Yes, states attorney, district attorney, General Attorney, prosecuting attorney, etc. Depends on the local jurisdiction and local government relative to the state and whether it's a city, state, county, or federal crime. \n\nThank you!", "\ud83d\ude02that's amazing, out the dog on the stand.

Especially as removing children from families may result in them being in the care of the state.", "This reads pretty passive aggressive, it's easy to miss sure but easy to spot as well. Maybe there should be a standard to write what country the posts are based from so more accurate advice can be given and we can apply cultural nuances to a situation.\n\nA lot of these responses are probably coming from frustration as it seems super common for US users to never pick up on when a post is from another country though its easily picked up by users in all other countries. Comes across a bit like main character syndrome (not trying to be aggressive at all just a little exasperated I guess)", "Not really. CPS in the UK is the Crown Prosecution Service AKA prosecutor's office. \n\nMost people who interact with Americans know that CPS in America means child protective services but there is a lot of room for confusion since both CPS and Social Services can play a role in these sorts of situations.", "Oh God, thank you for speaking up about the real issues: what currency is being used in the place this person is seeking help in. some of these guys were worried about the kid being neglected, but you're the real hero and pointed that out.", "Fair, thank you.\n\nIdk if I'd say it's clearly UK though, there's literally only one relevant symbol plus location isn't relevant. That's pretty easy to scan over and miss in a wall of text.", "I see context is not your strong suit. It's okay, reading comprehension isn't for everyone.", "Also her mum died, which is British English and narrows it down as well", "Eh, that one is not meaningful imo. I live in Canada and people use mom/mum interchangeably here. It depends on city/neighborhood/age. So OP could easily be Canadian instead.\n\nThe \u00a3 is solid and I completely missed it, but it's really the only clue.\n\nETA - and yes, I am well aware that Canada uses British English, it's why we didn't throw away the \"u\"s in our words like our southern neighbours."]}
