A\u2019s mum passed away when she was little so it\u2019s just her and her dad. Since he has started dating his girlfriend (we\u2019ll call her C) A\u2019s needs have been pushed to the side a little and he\u2019s just not noticed that A has been struggling. She\u2019s doing better now after getting the help she needed.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, A\u2019s hair has been extremely matted as it had not been brushed for months. A had been hiding her hair under hats and hoods at home and trying to disguise it at school in buns. She stayed over at the weekend and I only found out about her hair when they came downstairs after getting a comb stuck in A\u2019s hair trying to fix it. I comforted A as she was ashamed about her hair but had hoped that she and my daughter could fix it. My daughter convinced her to tell me about it as she had been scared to say anything to anyone as she thought she would be judged as her dad\u2019s girlfriend has made comments about her appearance when she was going through her health issues. When A was going through her issues, I made it clear to her and my daughter that our home is a judgement free zone and if she ever wanted to come to me or my husband for help then she would get it. A then asked for help detangling her hair. So that\u2019s what I did. We put on some films and worked on detangling A\u2019s hair. It took hours, but it was doable.\r  \n\r  \nWhen A went home on Sunday, her hair was completely detangled and neatly braided into two dutch braids. She was happy and thanked me for helping with her hair. Then Monday I got an angry phone call from C because she was meant to be taking A to get her hair cut due to how matted her hair was. Apparently C and A\u2019s dad had noticed how bad it was and C had told me that she would get it sorted. C is mad because the salon they were going to had charged her a cancellation fee for cancelling the day of the appointment. C wants me to pay her back for the cancellation fee as it\u2019s my fault for fixing A\u2019s hair when they were going to get it cut out. I told her that I wouldn\u2019t be paying it, I just did the right thing by A instead of going to the extreme option straight away. C then said that A was no longer allowed to be friends with my daughter and they would sue me for the cancellation fee. It was \u00a360 (half the cost of the cut).\r  \nMy daughter told me that A knew about C wanting to cut her hair and A didn\u2019t want the hair cut which is why she went to my daughter for help. A like my own daughters has long hair, so cutting the matted hair out would have meant her losing well over half of the length of her hair. \n\n\r  \nAITA for brushing out A\u2019s hair so she avoided getting a drastic cut.", "created_utc": 1701297605, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18729yz/aita_for_brushing_my_daughters_friends_extremely/", "score": 346, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was in A's position in middle school (my mom was alive- just a neglectful alcoholic). I used to get bullied so badly.

NTA at all, in any way, shape, or form!", "Nta for protecting a child who is clearly being neglected/borderline abused. I learned in a lot of my education courses that you can spot physical neglect through 5 areas, hair, teeth, weight, height, signs of brusing or breaks. You did the right thing. I'd mention it to someone who is a mandated reporter (teacher, doctor, etc) about how bad it truly was. Her dad's girlfriend doesn't sound good and dad is truly in a fog to not see it.", "Maybe speak directly to the dad?

They didn't need to cancel, they still could have gotten her hair cut if it was so important. They could have even gone with an easier style for her instead of shearing it all off. They saved some money(i doubt the cancelation fee was more than the appointment cost) and saved her hair, what are they pissed for? I'm hoping that this is just them lashing out temporarily because they're shamed but if the neglect was so bad that a thirteen year old had such matted hair, I'm worried for this kid.", "NTA. I feel so sorry for that kid.", "NTA- and if he sued child services would have a whole lot of questions about why they let it get so bad and stay that way for so long. Matted hair isn't just unhygienic, it's painful for a kid. You did a kind thing for a kid having a really hard time right now. Don't worry about it.", "NTA and C is full of shit. She didn\u2019t give a damn about that girl\u2019s hair. She could have very well still taken her to the salon because after a detangling like that you usually need a trim anyways. Or she could have taken her to get a style or a moisturizing treatment. But she didn\u2019t want to take her in the first place so she\u2019s lashing out to make it look like you\u2019re the problem.", "NTA. There was no reason to cancel the appointment since he hair would still need a trim to take off the dead ends. They would've likely shaved her head as with how negligent they've been it's very likely they would've shaved her head instead of paying for the labour to detangle that.  No matter which route they went the cost would've been more than the cancelation fee. Even when I had short hair (pixie) and wanted a trim most places wanted more than $50.", "NTA - have you considered calling child services on these neglectful fuck wits ?", "My best friend's mom used to do this for me when I was visiting family on my way home from college.  I was super depressed so my hair got really gross (I would go weeks without brushing or washing it).  She would spend hours picking out mats in my hair so I didn't have to cut it all off  (I had/have really long pretty hair, I cut it all off at one point but now it's long again).  It still makes me feel loved.", "NTA this is ridiculous.", "Nta but dad's gf is", "Definitely NTA. Good on you for being a positive light in that girl's life.

Long hair can often be a huge part of a teen girl's self image and relationship with their looks. Cutting it off can be a really emotional thing even before you get to all that she's been working through. For the GF to jump straight to cutting it off tells me that she didn't want to put in the effort to try to work through it (likely judging it to be difficult, frustrating, time-consuming ... all of which is true).
