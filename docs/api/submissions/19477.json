I feel like if I'm willing to do something for my gf out of kindness but she can't show that same kindness for me, that's an issue. \n\nI also did make myself tea and herself tea for a period of time. I've always made her tea", "Yes forgetful (that's her reasoning) but repeatedly forgetful. We used to take turns making breakfast and I'd always make 2 kinds (my toast with butter and hers with Nutella) but she would make them both Nutella and she knows I don't like Nutella but kept doing it. So I just took over breakfast duties.", "He says she does this a lot related to food and drink. This sounds like someone who doesn\u2019t care about their partners needs or feels their food preferences etc are stupid so they\u2019ll just do everything the way they like it instead. It is really inconsiderate.", "Cooking too, hence why I do the majority of it", "\u201cTired of taking the extra step to add sugar\u201d but he can\u2019t be tired of having to get up and do it himself. This makes no sense. OP isn\u2019t out of line for expecting his partner to know his tea order and do it properly and he\u2019s also not out of line to get fed up and say fine \u201cyou make your tea and I\u2019ll make mine\u201d. She\u2019s given him no choice bc at this point he always has to make his own tea since she refuses to do it properly in the 1st place.", "It's one extra step. I have reminded her a lot in the past so she should remember", "250ml? Standard mug size I guess", "The point is its entirely a matter of respect, its such a basic thing to show you care.\n\n>Edited to add: In a healthy relationship, he's really got two choices--accept that this is how she is, or break up with her. He's making this relationship unhealthy by choosing instead to freeze her out. What a catch. \n\nI love this take this is hilarious. His solution is entirely reasonable. I'll make my own tea and you can make yours. And she's having a fit. \n\n>I hope she comes to her senses soon, and finds someone who appreciates what she does do for them.\n\nAnother amazing take. She's weaponising incompetence, and OP should be grateful she can't make a cup of tea correctly. But she should absolutely come to her senses. Correct.\n\n>Second edit: Is he somehow allergic to the phrase \"thank you for the tea, darling, could you grab the sugar for me?\"\n\nYou could just read his other comments? He has said that. She ignores him. She doesn't care about his preferences. \n\n>Has someone broken his arms and legs and he's incapable of getting it himself? Will he positively shrivel up and die if he needs to walk to the kitchen? Let us all now pray for him...\n\nThis is absolutely your best take. And I totally agree. If he's going to the kitchen to get sugar he might as well make his own tea while he's at it. But that's not good enough for you because even when he offers to take care of making his own tea you complain he's freezing her out.\n\nSeriously read everything you have said. You are just agreeing with OP while trying to paint the girlfriend as a poor tea drinking Martyr for some reason.", "With one sugar in it.", "With sugar", "Same. I like a little sugar in a cup of black tea but sweet tea is disgustingly sweet.", "I don't think it's fair that my OH leaves the toilet seat up all the time & he doesn't think it's fair that I put it down \ud83d\ude02\nIt's life & not woth arguing about it when there's not much else to moan about \ud83d\ude09 \n\nMaybe the sugar isn't the real issue \ud83e\udd37", "OK, so now I'm wondering about what kind of odd domestic setup you have where you only drink tea upstairs.", "Solution:  Have a bowl of sugar upstairs.  Easy, peasy.", "Well, his worst problem is going to be that his gf leaves cuz he's making a mountain out of this.", "This is classic weaponized incompetence or complete inconsideration. She\u2019s hoping you take over all of the duties bc she\u2019s so \u201cforgetful\u201d!!", "You see, I don't know much about it but there are some 'conditions' where forgetting small details is sort of a symptom so it could be that she is wired that way. Again, I don't know much about it but I would try to look it up if I was you.", "He doesn\u2019t have to MAKE his own tea. He has to stir sugar into pre-made tea.", "Fyi, I think your gf is inconsiderate", "Honestly that you\u2019re taking this route makes me think maybe you do latch on to somewhat pedantic, petty arguments. \n\nIt sounds from your other comments that she is just a bit forgetful, if you\u2019re going to get this upset at a partner for such small mistakes YTA", "I will not stand for this sweet tea slander!", ">I don't think it's fair that my OH leaves the toilet seat up all the time & he doesn't think it's fair that I put it down \ud83d\ude02 It's life & not woth arguing about it\n\nOh man, we completely disagree. The toilet is absolutely worth arguing about! I would not be okay with shit particles being flung everywhere! \n\nThe toilet seat AND LID need to be kept down. Anything else is just nasty.", "It's a weird house. I think they switched the living room into a bedroom and vice versa because the kitchen and a bedroom is on the main floor and then the living room and a bed/office is the floor above", "Maybe that wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing. She\u2019s clearly inconsiderate and maybe she\u2019s not that into him. He can do better. If this was a 90s rom com and the genders were reversed this \u201ctea scene\u201d would be a pivotal moment when the main character realizes her fianc\u00e9 is a jerk and she should have loved the best friend from the start instead.", "She has no like issues with her mental health or have any disabilities like ADHD, she just doesn't take my preference into account", "But he does bc he has to get up and do it. So the \u201cnice\u201d gesture of making him tea is ruined bc he still has to work for it.", ">Honestly that you\u2019re taking this route makes me think maybe you do latch on to somewhat pedantic, petty arguments. \n\nThat's hilarious, OP has a normal preference for a cup of tea and you call them pedantic. \n\nDunno if you are British or Irish but as an Irish person I would be mortified if I got a strangers tea preference wrong, let alone my partners tea.\n\nIt's so little effort to remember that your partner likes one spoon of sugar. If the partner can not be bothered to remember or simply doesn't care that can be really hurtful. It's such a basic thing. My uncle died 12 years ago and I still remember he took his tea with a drop of milk and 2 sugars.", "They both sound kind of like jerks and only interested in themselves.", "LOL, standing up to get sugar is NOT the same as making his own tea.", "I respectfully disagree. I think this is a valid issue for him and if he thinks on it I bet he\u2019ll realize there are other aspects of their relationship that are incredibly one sided.", "It pretty much is the same. The point is she didn\u2019t do him a favor she gave him a chore. She loses points for the lack of effort and consideration. And I maintain if this was reversed (the girl friend was complaining about her tea being made incorrectly) everyone would be telling them to see the red flags and dump the inconsiderate boyfriend. It\u2019s a small gesture but it speaks volumes and I also maintain I bet things are one sided in other ways."]}
