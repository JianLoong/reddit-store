Whoever came would usually bring her own sweet treat, and we'd sip our tea and chat for an hour or two. \n\nIn the three years I knew her, I hosted tea 6-10 times. She hosted once. When I asked her why, she responded \"Oh, well, we usually alternate these things, and my mom drove us somewhere once, so...\".

The chores, that, for three years, I, another seventeen-year-old, had been doing myself. \n\nWhen asked even to involve herself more in our friendship because I was tired of extending all the effort, she stressed out and, long story short, our friendship broke apart.

My SO drinks coffee btw, so it\u2019s a moot point.\n\nI would never argue with my SO about it, but would refrain from putting sugar in their tea because I was raised that only barbarians defiled black tea in this manner.
