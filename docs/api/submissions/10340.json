If this turns out to not be true\u2026it changes things a bit. \n\nThat being said NTA. However, I would suggest in the future that you push to have management do this task. It was really unfair that you had to be the one to push this sensitive issue to a head. That being said, I don\u2019t know what else you we\u2019re supposed to do. You need a locker for work, they sadly can\u2019t have a permanent memorial in a necessary spot. I get why they were upset\u2026but it seems unfair to take it out on you. You didn\u2019t throw away the pictures, you clearly were trying to be respectful.\n\nSeriously I hope things improve and that you can find someone trustworthy at work to help you navigate that.", "NTA\n\n\"You guys are adults, figure it out\" is a pretty petulant way of diverting the talk away from management needing to get additional lockers set up for staff that need them.", "NTA- management and HR should of been the ones to handle this. They put you in an uncomfortable situation and set you up for that reaction. When you discussed it before with the Team, what suggestions on time line or solutions did they give you?", "ESH. ultimately management is the main AH, they need to provide more lockers and should have stepped up and handled this situation themselves. however, you are kind of an AH. You just started a new job, other ppl have been waiting for lockers longer than you, and after management did jack shit you kind of unilaterally stole a dead lady\u2019s shrine-locker. like I get it, I really do, but you sure aren\u2019t going to make many work-friends doing stuff like this\ud83d\ude02", "NTA. You did right by putting it elsewhere and not just throwing it away. You need a locker", "NTA it's a locker room,  not a mausoleum. Coworkers can remember and honor her in other ways and places.", "Nta. Management is the AH for nor stepping in.", "I\u2019m going with ESH. \n\nFor you soft AH for moving sentimental items. I\u2019m not sure how important this was to them but apparently it was important enough to keep it for so long and you ignored it. \n\nYour employer is the major AH for not offering adequate facilities. And they could\u2019ve offered a memorial plaque somewhere in the building but decided to not interfere when their employee dies and their coworkers are in mourning.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA, I could see it being okay for a little while but not a permanent memorial. Surely there\u2019s a better place for it?", "NTA\n\nThose 5 people who knew the deceased should have been giving up one of their lockers if they insisted on maintaining the deceased's locker. At some point, all five of those people who knew the deceased will leave, and it's unfair to all incoming employees for them to be short a locker.", "Nta, it\u2019s a bit odd to turn a locker into a memorial. If you threw out her pics etc you\u2019d definitely be TA but you didn\u2019t so all good in my eyes", "NTA, setting aside a locker for a dead person is weird as heck", "Nta. They can have a shrine elsewhere", "I'm going to say NTA. Less than half of the employees even knew her, and they are dictating what her former locker (no longer hers! She's not employed there anymore, in part because she is now deceased) is used for? There already isn't enough space for all the employees, and to take away even more space is inappropriate, especially since it's really not their call. As your coworkers continue to call you an AH, respond with \"Oh, so you're going to share your locker with me? Great! I hope there's enough room...once I move my stuff in with yours you can reset the memorial.\" The idea of losing their space is not going to sit well with most of the employees, so that will likely quiet at least the ones who didn't even know her and are complaining. Regarding the memorial, something else really should have been done (a plaque or something else). While it would be nice to leave something like that up for a short time, it's not appropriate to deny new hires access to something everyone else has access to for a memorial. That right there is already creating a hostile work environment against the new hires and they've barely even begun! For this reason alone, management and HR really dropped the ball. If a new hire were to be ok with not having the space yet for say 1 week, then that's nice, but otherwise take the memorial and set it up elsewhere where it isn't an imposition.", "Is there a place where you could \"move\" the memorial? Like a table, or a shelf, or something like that? If so, maybe set up a picture or two, and have a little basket with the some of the \"freebies\" that the deceased coworker shared with the others.  That way the others will still have their little place to remember their friend, you will have shown that you respect the others' feelings, and you can have a locker.  \n\nIt does seem strange to me that the staff would keep their deceased coworker's locker unchanged for a long time.  I don't know how long it has been since they lost her, and I know that grief has no time limit....but keeping her locker as it was indefinitely, just because it was her locker, does nothing to bring the actual person back. \n\nNAH (except your management, who passed the buck on purpose).\n\n(Edit: punctuation, duh)\n\nAnother edit: I just re-read the post and see that OP did in fact already move the locker stuff to a nearby table.  Maybe restock the freebie pile, or find out some of her interests and make a small (like $10) donation in her name to a charity with similar goals?  Or, if she died from a condition that has a charity working towards curing that condition, maybe to them?  Maybe I'm just a people pleaser, but it seems like that might smooth the waters a little.", "NTA.  It's a work thing. You need a locker.  They can build a memorial elsewhere. Or a fund in her name for more lockers.", "INFO how long ago did she die? If it was a year or two, or less, you're the A, but if it was more like 5 to 10 years I'd say no assholes except the managers who forced you to become the bad guy in the situation.", "NTA. You have to put your stuff somewhere. They\u2019re ridiculous.", "YTA.  You\u2019re ignoring the human interaction part of your NEW workplace.  It\u2019s more important than you think.  You can know all there is to know but if you can\u2019t feel out the culture and ease your way in, it\u2019s not going to go well.", "ESH, can\u2019t you share a locker with someone?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
