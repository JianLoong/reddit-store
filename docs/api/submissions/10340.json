She's not employed there anymore, in part because she is now deceased) is used for? There already isn't enough space for all the employees, and to take away even more space is inappropriate, especially since it's really not their call. As your coworkers continue to call you an AH, respond with \"Oh, so you're going to share your locker with me? Great! I hope there's enough room...once I move my stuff in with yours you can reset the memorial.\" The idea of losing their space is not going to sit well with most of the employees, so that will likely quiet at least the ones who didn't even know her and are complaining. Regarding the memorial, something else really should have been done (a plaque or something else). While it would be nice to leave something like that up for a short time, it's not appropriate to deny new hires access to something everyone else has access to for a memorial. That right there is already creating a hostile work environment against the new hires and they've barely even begun! For this reason alone, management and HR really dropped the ball. If a new hire were to be ok with not having the space yet for say 1 week, then that's nice, but otherwise take the memorial and set it up elsewhere where it isn't an imposition.", "Is there a place where you could \"move\" the memorial? Like a table, or a shelf, or something like that? If so, maybe set up a picture or two, and have a little basket with the some of the \"freebies\" that the deceased coworker shared with the others.  That way the others will still have their little place to remember their friend, you will have shown that you respect the others' feelings, and you can have a locker.  \n\nIt does seem strange to me that the staff would keep their deceased coworker's locker unchanged for a long time.  I don't know how long it has been since they lost her, and I know that grief has no time limit....but keeping her locker as it was indefinitely, just because it was her locker, does nothing to bring the actual person back. \n\nNAH (except your management, who passed the buck on purpose).\n\n(Edit: punctuation, duh)\n\nAnother edit: I just re-read the post and see that OP did in fact already move the locker stuff to a nearby table.  Maybe restock the freebie pile, or find out some of her interests and make a small (like $10) donation in her name to a charity with similar goals?
