My family lives in another state, sometimes they come here, sometimes we go to them. This year was my families time, but my husband needed to be home for a doctor\u2019s appointment.\n\nDuring a phone conversation with my parents, they said they wouldn\u2019t come up so that we could go to my husbands family. He has a big family and they do a lot of games. They assumed it would be more fun for us since it\u2019s just to 2 of them and our family is small. My husband told them no, come on up, it\u2019s your Christmas come spend it with us, we want you here. So they decided to come up. \n\nBoth families celebrate on Christmas Eve, we discussed still going but only a few hours, which he agreed. He proceeded to go  the entire Christmas Eve, from 3:30-midnight. I\u2019m upset because that\u2019s not what we agreed on, we agreed to only go for a few hours. We argued about it and he said \u201cI\u2019m going to spend Christmas with my family, it\u2019s only 1/2 a day!\u201d  I took a separate car, went and returned, but he kept our son there. He even told his family it was our Christmas with them and that\u2019s why I was leaving. They have always offered my parents to come over there, but my parents have done it once and we\u2019re super uncomfortable.\n\nMy parents are upset, since they offered not to come specifically so he could spend Christmas with his family. My husband thinks I\u2019m wrong for being upset as we technically did spend Christmas Day with them. Considering that\u2019s not when we celebrate, it\u2019s not the same. We normally cook a nice meal and open presents after. They *ate* baked potatoes alone at my home.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m new and it\u2019s not letting me reply to posts.

He knows that what he did was in bad faith and he ruined your Christmas. This is not someone who respects his wife and his marriage. He put his mother\u2019s company over yours. He made it clear that he doesn\u2019t want to spend Christmas with you. Make sure you get your son for Christmas next year and don\u2019t trust a word he says.", "I know Reddit is global so I\u2019m going to make a reference that not everyone will understand. \n\nIn the US we had a comic called Peanuts. And in the comic there was a girl named Lucy. Lucy used to mess with this kid named Charlie Brown. She would promise to hold a football so Charlie could kick it. But at the last minute she\u2019d pull it away and Charlie would fly up into the air and then crash to the ground.\n\nYour husband pulled a Lucy. He made a promise and then yanked it away. And it was more hurtful than if he\u2019d never made the promise to begin with. \n\nThat said. You need to stand up. \u201cHe kept our son there\u2026\u201d  Why did you allow that?\n\nYour husband is the a- hole. Has he done stuff like this before?", "Nta", "Depends on how many families he has, I guess.", "NTA - your husband was extremely disrespectful to your parents. There needs to be a real conversation about his behavior and how you would never treat his family this way. I can\u2019t imagine how hurt your parents are, especially after they offered not to come. This is one of those moments where you need to be crystal clear about expectations and respect.", "You can't all spend Christmas together?\n\nESH if so", "NTA\n\nNot at all. This was so unfair & disrespectful to you & your parents.\n\nYour husband broke his promise & also kept your son with him.\n\nIs he often this cavalier about his promises/your feelings? If so I'm sorry to say you may have bigger marital issues to resolve than just this.", "Thank you for updating the baked potato remark. The original was cracking me up. \n\nIt does beg another question tho\u2026 why did your parents eat baked potatoes alone at your house? You said you left your husband\u2019s family\u2019s house early. You still could have cooked together and opened presents when you returned. Or at least cooked and had a meal. Why were they alone for dinner?\n\nYour husband obviously sucks, that hasn\u2019t changed. But I\u2019m kind of confused by this.", "NTA and slightly YTA. Let me explain.\n\nHusband went back on his word and made his in laws feel like they didn't matter once he was over at his family's house. He failed to uphold the one agreement that you two have had for a long time. He insisted the in laws come up, and they did, then he snubs them on the night they spend celebrating Christmas in lieu of family.\n\nAlthough, it does bother me, personally, that your parents don't want to spend holidays with his family. Why is it uncomfortable? Because they are the elders of the family as a whole, it's on them to make it fun and entertaining for them. If it's lack of knowing one another, that's their own fault.\n\nI feel there's a missing piece of the puzzle here as to why the in laws don't get along or don't have a good time when in each other's presence. How often do you and your husband host events so that both families can mingle and get to know one another? Seems like there's a failure there, and it's on the both of you.", "ESH except your parents. They did the right thing by offering not to come. I wonder if your husband felt pressured by you to say they should come. The reality is your son would have more fun at the big family gathering playing games then at home with 4 adults. It sounds simple enough to invite your parents to his family\u2019s Christmas Eve. If they chose to not go then they can make their own plans for dinner. You could then celebrate with them on Christmas. The tradition of it having to be on Christmas Eve for both families is silly when your parents are just two more adults.", "NTA. you should have taken your son home.", "NTA what was the point of him insisting they come up then?", "NTA. He invited them to come to your house, knowing it was your family\u2019s turn to celebrate on Christmas Eve. His behaviour was rude and inconsiderate. He is the reason your parents visited. It\u2019s like a slap in the face that he went to his parents, stayed later than agreed and kept your child with him. So not only did he deprive your parents, he also deprived his child from spending time with his maternal grandparents.", "Your husband is not a team player.\nThis is the kind if thing that festers into bigger problems.\n\nI would go for a few counseling  sessions....because I'm sure this kind of disrespect is not a one off.\n\nGood luck. Oh, and NTA", "NTA. But baked potatoes at home, what does that mean? Your husband's word has no meaning now and you should tell him he is in the dog house and had to earn his trust back. As for extra bake potatoes they make good hashbrown potatoes.", "NTA\n\nBut I think that your parents are a bit for just not joining the party with his family, since they are invited.  It would simplify so much, why does the party with both *have* to be on Christmas Eve and not on Christmas Day?  So many things can be done differently and instead of being a bit flexible, you made you and your parents the \"baked potatoes\". \n\nWhy were they uncomfortable with his family?  Was anyone rude?  I stress this because my family is the big family, my children's in-laws are always invited to join us.  They do and they are part of the family just like everyone when they are there.  We are big and there are people all over doing various activities, I have a large place, so we tend to spread out, we are loud sometimes, but there are no petty arguments and no drama.  When it's a lot for my introverted kids (or guests), they can go to one of the bedrooms to recharge.  I guess ultimately, I am wondering who is really the one that doesn't want to be together? \n\nWe celebrate on Christmas Day sometimes and on Christmas Eve sometimes and even the Sunday after or before if that's what works for the majority.  I don't understand why your parents and his parents will only celebrate the one day.", "Nta - you have a husband problem. I suggest counselling.", "NTA. I am curious when you say your husband \"kept your son\". How did he do that without your permission? Did your son want to stay? Why did you not make dinner for your parents as planned?", "I will not say y t a, but, the reality is once you are blending families, and then starting your own traditions, things have to change. \n\nWhy could you not celebrate with his family Christmas Eve and yours on Christmas day this year, and reverse it next year. \n\nAs your child grows it may become more important to have everyone at your place Christmas day so your child can actually enjoy their gifts instead of being shuffled around.\n\nYou need to communicate as spouses and build new traditions as your family grows, and then be ready to change them all again. That doesn't mean you can't pull in pieces of your traditions as you make new memories.", "NTA - your husband behaved selfishly and inconsiderately. I\u2019d be embarrassed and angry.", "NTA. And I would have taken my son with me.", "NTA. I would just feel like my parents weren't respected or valued if they came up to spend a holiday with us, and my partner thought it was appropriate to leave them home alone during that time. And I would feel condescended to if someone tried to convince me that the time we always spend together during the holiday wasn't an important period of time. \n\nHe wanted to have everyone available for him to interact with in the way he wanted to at the times he wanted, with no consideration about their enjoyment or feelings. That's simply self-centered.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

His family lives nearby while you have to travel to yours. \n\nThis year was meant to be Christmas with your family but your husband needed to be home for an appointment so you (your nuclear family of you, your husband, your child) stayed home. \n\nYour husband invited your family to come to you for Christmas as \"it's your Christmas, come spend it with us, we want you here.\"\n\nBoth of your families do your main celebration of Christmas on Christmas Eve. His side does lots of games and spends the whole afternoon and evening. Your side does a nice meal and opens presents. Your Christmas day is usually spent quietly.\n\nYour family came to stay for Christmas.\n\nYour husband then spent the entirety of Christmas Eve with his family and kept your son there with him. You went to his parents' house and then came back partway through.\n\nYour parents therefore spent Christmas Eve alone, eating baked potatoes and opening presents by themselves. They didn't see their grandchild for the part of Christmas (the Christmas Eve dinner and present opening) that is most special to them.\n\nAssuming this is the correct understanding of events. You are NTA. Your husband is TA. Your husband invited your parents up so that he could technically say they had \"their turn\" which would mean that next Christmas you would go to HIS parents. But he tried to \"eat his cake and have it\" by spending the part of Christmas that is most special to all of you (including yorur parents) at his parents house. He basically cheated on your arrangement by taking for his parents the part that is the part each of you loves the most. He also treated his guests abominably by expecting them to either be alone on Christmas Eve or spend it in an unfamliar environment where they are sidelined. \n\nI would tell him that his so-called Christmas with your parents was cheating and manipulative and you don't accept it. Next year is your parents' turn to have a proper Christmas with you and you will be taking your child there, with or without him. \n\nTotally unacceptable behavior on his part.", "NTA your husband is inconsiderate and rude.", "Info: why didn't you have the meal you'd planned to have with just the 3 of you?\n\n> They are baked potatoes alone at my home.\n\nWhat does this sentence mean?", "NTA, he went back on his word and wasted your parents time and told them that ye would celebrate with them! Ye had a fair way of spending time with both families and he broke that! It's really unfair on your parents and you should be annoyed, tell him now that next year he can spend Christmas day with his parents and Christmas Eve with yours!", "ESH. You don't leave your house guests home alone to go to a party elsewhere, no matter what the occasion. Either take them with you \u2014 *with the host's permission* \u2014 or don't go. Both you and your husband were rude to your parents. Since you returned home at a reasonable-ish time, your husband is more of an AH than you, but neither of you put any effort into celebrating or spending time with your parents.", "NTA - Husband went back on the spirit of the agreement, if not the letter.  \n\n\n\"They are baked potatoes alone at my home.\" is perhaps the saddest potato related sentence I've read in 2023, btw.", "NTA. You had an agreement and he broke it. Trying to justify it after the fact doesn't change the reality of the situation. You have a tradition/established pattern, AND he insisted on your family visiting this year, AND he agreed to only go to his family's place for a few hours. Don't let him gaslight you by saying he upheld his end of the agreement - he did not. I would be very upset with him for diminishing my parents' involvement and their holiday. He owes you all an apology and a promise not to do it again.", "Nta is he like this with everything because he is being super selfish.

Such a bad host.", "Why? My mom's side and my dad's side NEVER spent Christmas together.

Usually a nice Christmas dinner we would start cooking around 4 pm to be ready to eat around 7 pm.", "I've spent many Christmases with my husband's family and have always felt like an outsider. Things will always be done a little differently in each person's home and you'll feel like you can't really relax in the home of your daughter's parents-in-law. Also you'll hardly see your grandchild as he/she will be focused on the other grandparents as the atmosphere will be focused on the other grandparents' hoem.", "This! And if it's just OP's parents, why can't they do Christmas Day instead? They seem to be looking for ways to make this complicated when there are some simple solutions.

But that doesn\u2019t explain why her parents were eating baked potatoes home alone. They could have easily planned ahead and had a real meal when she arrived back home.", "This was my thoughts exactly. It\u2019s tradition that both families celebrate on Christmas Eve well traditions change when family members are added. It\u2019s only her parents so easier for them to adapt.", "Well, that was my original guess.. which is why I asked why she didn't make the dinner she had planned to make. But then i thought perhaps it was a saying i don't know, about them sitting around doing nothing.. which is why i asked OP to clarify.", "Info: why couldn\u2019t the three of you join your husbands family on the same night?", "Nta and next year take just your son to your parents for all Christmas eve.  Get back just in time to put the kiddo to bed.  Ofc dont wake him up early!  He had a big night!! Do nothing you'd usually do- no food prep, no wrapping his family's presents.  After all of its fine for him to do, its fine for you to do.", "NTA, your husband is. How mean and disrespectful he was to your parents. He better make this up to you and them, big time.  He was selfish, conceited and, quite frankly, a TERRIBLE host. Im sure his parents would be mortified to know he treated you and your parents like this.", "NTA, but your husband definitely is", "yta for refusing to have the christmas eve dinner with your parents you promised them just bc you were mad at your husband.", "I would be so upset. Your husband is the AH and you are NTA.", "I know right? If you're pulling this crap at christmas, goodness knows what daily life is like. Poor OP and OPs parents x", "So? Just because both sides of your family were unwilling to model *the exact reason for the season* doesn't make them the poster family for Christmas. One side of the family has 2 people. Two people willing to debase themselves/stay home alone as a 'favor' to the other side of the family. WTF would it not be 2nd nature to just invite them over? Who is that soulless (besides your family of course)?"]}
