That is beautiful work, by a clearly talented artist with real tools.  But it makes sense to give a friend a discount for their birthday, especially if you had fun.  NTA at all, and wtf is up with your mom\u2019s attitude??\n\nEdit to add- I have a friend who\u2019s a painter, and I bought a PRINT of one of her pieces for $200.  You\u2019re giving your friends the originals.  No question that\u2019s a great price.", "NTA. Know your worth and add tax.\nAlso your mom sounds like an AH.", "NTA. \n\nHere's the reality of the free market: your portraits are worth whatever your friend is willing to pay. \n\nNot what your mother says they are worth.\n\nSo if your friend says she will pay $150, that's what they are worth, and that's what you charge. \n\nSounds like your mom likes to undercut you. Value her input at $0, because that's what you should pay for her advice here.", "Definitely NTA.... you should be proud of your abilities and should charge MUCH more for your hard work, the knowledge/skill set it took to get to this point and for supplies...(Copics and color pencils are not cheap). Keep going and don't listen to people who devalue your art.", "NTA. Your friend was willing to pay your price, so obviously they thought it was worth it. Unfortunately, family can sometimes be our worst critics instead of our biggest supporters.", "100%Nta, H\u20acll naw this art here is worth that price, seriously your mom is a dumba$$ for making you doubt yourself and trying to make you drop the price, seriously do not listen to your mom on this subject at all and stick to your guns.", "NTA! Those are both beautiful works. I think a lot of artists undercharge for their work, and $150 is definitely a big discount. You put in time and effort into them, money into the art supplies, and time and effort into building up your skills.", "NTA if - As an artist my self, I think it depends on the expectation and the outcome. If someone saw your work and agreed to the price at your skill level then who cares what someone else thinks of the cost. Value is determined by the consumer. If your friend is happy who cares? \nHowever, YTA -  If you over sold your skill level that\u2019s an entirely different story. If you promised realism and did caricatures as the consumer they have every right to be pissed. \n\nAs far as your parents go they they are the A for not being supportive.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And the picture you put on this looks amazing btw. Also that is about the same price you\u2019d get buying that stuff online.. also do you have a social media where you post your stuff", "NTA. That is great work and we\u2019ll worth $150.", "NTA at all! \n\nWhat gorgeous, sumptuous, quality work.  I wish I could do what you can do!", "Nta. You can charge as much as you want and the customer has a right not to buy. Welcome to capitalism.", "NTA you can charge as much as you want for your work. You're not forcing anyone to buy your art so if they want to pay your price then it's all good. \n\nI now have to think about that song \"it costs that much cause it takes me f-ing hours, it costs that much cause I don't have super powers, you have to pay for my skills, exposure doesn't pay the bills, ...\"", "NTA, You can charge whatever you want for your art. Even if you weren't busy and didn't have to buy supplies, it's your right to charge for a service that you've spent (presumably) years perfecting. $150 is honestly not that much for something like this.", "NTA. That\u2019s a gorgeous set of portraits! I\u2019d definitely pay that for one from you.", "NTA you gave her a fat discount already? I've paid more for lesser quality work.", "NTA You did a job (a wonderful one at that) and you deserve to get paid. I used to be a dog groomer and I know how exhausting it can be to wrestle with wet dogs all day. You have every right to charge money for commissions, just as you have every right to be paid for grooming dogs. $75 for a hand painted piece of that quality is a steal! Maybe if they were mass produced prints you'd be overcharging, but never underestimate the value of something hand crafted.", "NTA - You agreed a price for the work and the contract was fulfilled by both parties. Don\u2019t know what business it is of your mother\u2019s.\n\nSounds like she might be a little envious of your talents.", "I'd say YTA but if your \"friend\" paid without any complaints then, I guess NTA \ud83e\udd37", "NTA. People honestly tend to undervalue and not appreciate artists and the time, effort and materials that go into creating their pieces.  \n\n\nI'd say you're undercharging for your work.", "NTA. Shoot I'd pay at least $200 for the kitty commission. These are beautiful. I know art supplies are pricey. I just replaced my Prisma colors and the case I got was only 48 colors and cost me I've 70$ usd", "If those are the portraits, they look amazing!\n\nForgot judgement. NTA. It looks like you put a lot of work into it. I admit I don't know much about selling art. However, if you set a price and the buyer didn't have a problem with it then it's all good. $150 also doesn't sound like alot for portraits like this.", " NTA of course. People value items on what they like and will pay for it. Is mum an art appraiser?", "NTA\n\nThose look like they took a fair amount of time to make. She sounds like someone who sees no value in art.", "NTA. That's the average for ONE realistic portraits.", "NTA. She's not paying you for the supplies. You don't pay a person making your wedding cake for just the ingredients. She's paying for the practice to develop the skill to make those portraits. If she's willing to pay, that's a reasonable price for a skilled artisan with quality tools to create art. Honestly, if you're good, that's damned cheap.", "NTA - your mom is a jealous AH. That sound like a discount even, I assume it took hours and hours.", "NTA, except that you significantly undercharged for them. Friend/ favor price is fair, but you'd better be charging more (and by more, I mean close to double) for true commissions! They're both gorgeous works, and you should be incredibly proud of yourself!", "NTA. Those are beautiful. I used to do exhibits as a child and sold my paintings for ~$500 and I wasn't that good, plus those rates was for 30 years ago. I have since sold me soul to the ad industry and make about $100 per hour if we stick to the 8-hr/day workweek (we don't, but hey).\n\nSo you're actually charging too little for your talent and I get it, it's friend price and building up a portfolio. Keep at it! If you wanna do it full time it can happen, I have friends who are full time painters now and sell their work for $1000 - $5000 per canvas. Not even the size is what drives it, it's also the skill. Get that dough!!!\n\nETA I took a peek at them twitter links you posted, you're deffo charging too little. I'd even charge more for face only because of your skill and you put in a lot of work detailing.", "NTA at all. Why is this mom's business? And is she an artist or something? How does she know what is your best work vs. what isn't?  Super fair price for some gorgeous artwork.", "It wasn\u2019t for her birthday, but for her boyfriends. If it was for her birthday I would of absolutely given a belated birthday discount haha", "Now me too!", "I had originally wanted to charge more towards 200 since I\u2019m trying not to lowball myself so much. In the beginning I told her it would be close to the 150 mark and she was okay with that. I refunded the 100 and kept 50 after feeling bad and she sent the 100 back.", "I can\u2019t imagine my mom being jealous of me, I don\u2019t know why she would be. She has said some self deprecating stuff like not having any \u201ctalent\u201d but still. Tysm!", "Yup, those are. I didn\u2019t charge 150 each btw, it\u2019s 150 for both total", "She is a very\u2026 critical person.", "I don\u2019t remember specifically how long it took but for both it took well over 10 hours and many sleepless nights", "As she should. She commissioned an artist to create those and she got some fantastic, personalized pieces created with a great deal of skill. Those are well worth $150, it's a bargain for something commissioned and of that quality.", "Then she thinks the $150 price is fair. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what anyone else thinks. There\u2019s no objective value for your art. Only what someone is willing to pay.", "You are very talented. Just remember this!", "Sour grapes, I'd say then. Most likely not a happy person in her life's position. Or jealous.", "Probably works out to less than $10 an hour for highly skilled labor. You're not charging them professional prices or anything.", "WHAT??!!!\n\nNTA!  You are obviously quite talented because she chose to purchase two of your works of art as a gift for her boyfriend!  You use premium quality materials, and your time and value of your talents are worthy of the price you deem fit to charge!  I am so sorry that your parents are not as enthused or supportive of your talents as they should be.\n\nI am a lover of the arts, and am in awe of the talents of my own kids.  I will send my honorary motherly pride to you for a job well done!  You keep working on honing your skills and producing one of a kind works!  Mom and Dad can pick their jaws up off the floor when you sell out your first gallery showing!  You go!", "NTA. In fact that's cheap! Some artists would charge 150 each for that kinda work. In fact some artists will charge 150 for prints, originals would be much more. It takes hours to make really amazing portraits on top of the overhead cost of materials.  \n\nMom doesn't know what she's talking about. This is work and assuming something like this was done in say 10hours or so that's $15 an hour. This is just above minimum wage depending on which state you live in.", "Info: Did you two agree on a price beforehand or did you just decide this on your own?", "NTA Holy shit only $150 for both? You\u2019re undercharging honestly, Copic markers are super expensive too. It sucks your mom isn\u2019t proud and what kind of parent just says \u2018it\u2019s not your best work\u2019 and then berates you for charging money? Is she often jealous of you or anything?", "NTA", "You're undercharging.", "NTA even if it was 150 each thats absolutely a good price! People have no clue what it takes to do this type of work, the hours of practice, of actual labour, materials, care. This is something that will last forever and you are amazing!! Dont let non-artists confuse you, dont undervalue your work and keep killing it!!!", "NTA - I\u2019d gladly pay more than that for the kitty alone.  Your work is excellent, my dude.  Don\u2019t let your mother get to you (difficult, I know) - charge what your talents are worth.", "nta except possibly being ta to yourself. you\u2019re wildly undercharging.", "Absolutely NTA. That is a beautiful piece with a TON of cool detail. Definitely something to be treasured. The cat is lovely too! So much texture!", "NTA. Frankly I think you're undercharging.", "NTA never feel bad for getting paid for your work. If the person buying them is ok with the price then clearly it isn't too high :)", "NTA\nHonestly , nothing matters except the fact that you and your friend agreed on a price, ($150 for both) and your friend paid it. If your friend isn\u2019t bothered by the price, then it really doesn\u2019t matter what your mom says. She\u2019s just throwing her opinion around and that\u2019s totally ok, but it doesn\u2019t matter what your mother thinks when you have friends that see the value in your art and are willing to pay what you charge.", "For your skill level and the time you put into this, $150 for both is incredibly generous of you. Friends - and family - should understand and value your talent and work, and be willing to pay fair prices for them. You've already given them a huge discount. Your mom is talking BS.\n\nThese portraits are beautiful!!", "Your artwork is beautiful! Love how vibrant and sunny the cat portrait feels. Are the people receiving your gift intend to hang it on a wall? If so please tell them to put it behind a UV resistant glass. Copics being ink dyes do not tolerate sunlight well, my art teacher copic work that she hung on a wall had faded to almost nothing. Would hate to see it happen to your amazing efforts.\nAs far as the original question goes - NTA. $150 for two originals is actually too cheap.", "People always undervalue artists\u2019 work. Don\u2019t internalize that. Your mom is speaking from a place of ignorance, and I hope will learn to better understand and support your career as an artist.", "Nta and wow you're an amazing artist!", "NTA and beautiful work!", "LOVE the Squishmallow earrings.", "NTA.  Your art is worth what someone is willing to pay for it.", "NTA. You are very talented and I would pay $150 for portraits I would treasure forever. You didn\u2019t charge a crazy amount. Your subjects really come alive here and I can feel their personalities from my phone screen. And that\u2019s not easy to pull off. If you\u2019re only 18, I\u2019m exited for your future career, even if it\u2019s as a hobby. Go you!", "What you charge is entirely between you and your client. Your parents don\u2019t get to criticize you for it - ESPECIALLY when you made more than they think you should! NTA", "NTA. Beautiful work. The picture of the two of them is full of life and personality and love. The cat is fantastic. You should be very proud of yourself, and I hope you can make a successful career out of your art, if that\u2019s what you want for yourself, because you have the eye for it.", "Nta it should have been $150 EACH minimum. These are professional level quality (and gorgeous). My general rule of thumb is $20/hour + cost of supplies used, but i wouldn't begrudge anyone for charging more than that. And i also charge extra for traditional art if they are receiving the original. Non artists often don't understand how much work goes into art, and they also seem to think that because it's \"fun\" that it's not really \"work\"... It's a hard mindset to break out of.", "obviously NTA charge whatever the hell you want for your artwork. You don\u2019t owe it to anybody to make your art affordable enough for them and you\u2019re undercharging anyways. People don\u2019t appreciate artists because they only see the end result, not the hours spent on the piece and years of practice it takes  (not even counting materials).", "AMAZING ART!!!! NTa!!!", "These are really good. You are so talented.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCharge WHATEVER you like. ANd get them to agree before you start painting / hand over the pictures.  If they don't like your prices, don't let them have your art.", "NTA that\u2019s a more than fair price. Art, especially commissioned, is something even my poor ass wouldn\u2019t try to get money off of. Artists deserve every penny.", "While beauty is in the eye of the beholder, your Mum needs her eyes checked.  I'd pay you more than $150 for a portrait of my puppy.  I love your work and you are NTA.", "150 total?\n\nAnd the friend was happy with it . AND got the original, not a print?\n\nYeah, undercharged is more applicable - the 'friend discount' should be greatly appreciated.\n\nNice your parents are so 'supportive'. You can bet that should your art start to generate a nice income for you, they\\`ll be holding out hands with \"we always supported you\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA my Wife agrees and she\u2019s an artist. She says to explain the hours you put into it.", "These are fabulous\n\nIs your mother against you earning money ?", "NTA, personally I think you are underchargeing and both pieces need to be that amount.", "Jesus, Your amazing..!! \nYour are rly underchagering yourself..\nYou could easy sell them for 400 or more a piece.. \nYour work is beautiful, and i would Love to hire you for a real price to do work for me..", "Your art is beautiful. You're definitely NTA.", "I agree, $150 isn't enough for work like that!! OP how many hours did you spend on these??", "Yeah, I literally said \"you are *undercharging*\" just as I scrolled down and saw this.", "Agreed beforehand. Also sent multiple progress pics", "I don\u2019t want to say she\u2019s often jealous of me but maybe she is. She has a lot of problems with me and what I like or want to do, like transition (I\u2019ve been out of the closet publically since I was 12 btw), moving out, how I dress ect. So her being like that towards my art isn\u2019t too much of a surprise but it still hurts. I hope Im just overthinking things", "I didn\u2019t keep track but considering it was over the span of about 2-3 weeks, 2-4 hours a day\u2026 probably 20 hours or more. It was spread out so much though due to work so it\u2019s hard to say", "She\u2019s a good friend, don\u2019t let your mom get to you.", "Sounds like she has self esteem problems. People who are hard on themselves can also be hard on anyone they see as extensions of themselves.\n\nDon\u2019t let her get you down.", "Then NTA. If it's an agreement that both parties are satisfied with, then there's no problem.", "I agree with the people saying that, if anything, you undercharged.\n\nIf you break something down and come up with an \"hours worked\" amount of \"1/2 a week's worth of working hours\", generally the price you're charging should be roughly equivalent to 1/2 a week's worth of $$$.\n\nYou're 19, and we tend to get paid better the older we get, but assuming you could have been making at least minimum wage in those hours, even though it's your hobby and you were enjoying the process that's a really incredibly good deal for the person who gets the benefit of your labour.\n\nAlso, you're really talented and you make great art!!", "Try explaining to your mother how hurt you are that she doesn't think your art is worth being paid less than minimum wage.\n\nNTA But your mother sure is (as is your father for not saying something). You're very talented, your pieces are very detailed and took a lot of hard work, and art supplies are expensive. \n\nI just hope you start charging more for your work (especially if not being done for a friend).", "I'm confused. You were commissioned by someone other than your mother to create these.\n\nWas the client happy? Because that's all that matters. If the client was happy to exchange $150 for the pictures, then the pictures were worth at least $150 to the client.\n\nAssuming that's all true, then who cares what your mother thinks? She clearly has no idea what she's talking about, so brush it off and be happy."]}
