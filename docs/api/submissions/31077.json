My brother only invited our mother and his father, and refused to have me, our siblings, our grandmother or anyone else of our family attend his wedding. At first he told us it was because he wanted a child free wedding and that means grandma couldn't go because she is the go to child care and they wanted a small wedding, 10 guests each. Okay fine. \nHis wedding comes and passes and pictures are posted (btw my mom did not go). In these pictures his wife has almost her whole family is there, the youngest being 2 years old along with many other children. This made everyone in my family upset, along with that he wanted our mom to wear an olive green dress bc he said it would match his dads suit vest. When the pics came out no one had green, his dad had an ice blue vest, bridesmaids wore orange and groomsmen wore tan. My mom would've been the only one wearing green which was not told to her\n\nAlso him and his wife don't like the fact that I can have kids and they can't and they didn't want me and my children there to remind them, but they had other little kids and babies there. My brother and I used to be very close and now he won't talk to me and if he visits its for less than 30 mins.\n\nBut am I the asshole for not wanting him to be there for my wedding when the rest of my family will be?", "created_utc": 1700117738, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17wgkyd/aita_for_not_inviting_my_brother_and_his_wife_to/", "score": 54, "replies": ["NTA- they excluded you intentionally, so you did the same. What's fair is fair. I wouldn't jump to compulsions about the kid thing unless you really know but that doesn't really matter in this context imo.

Have a wonderful wedding day.", "Congratulations and NTA \n\nHe didn\u2019t invite you so you are not obligated to invite him.", "NTA.\n\nThey set the precedent, family isn't automatically invited.  And based on their explicitly denying you (and most/all of your family) to come, they shouldn't expect to go to yours.  You've nothing to feel bad for, I'd not invite them either.", "NTA it\u2019s your wedding day, invite who you want.", "NTA.  Have a conversation with your brother (when you feel up to it).  Your wedding, you get to invite who you want.  Have a wonderful life!", "Definitely NTA. Sounds as if your joke of a \u201csister-in-law,\u201d has your brother henpecked .", "NTA\u2026. This is the consequence of is own actions \u2026..Congratulations", "Nta but you need to talk to him about this because that\u2019s his position. It\u2019s up to him to fix these issues between his side of immediate family and his wife.", "NTA I would not want him there either. Your brother sounds codependent.", "Your JNbrother and his JNWife burned the bridge with you and your family. You should save your invites for people who matter to you and value you and your fiance. \nHave a great wedding and a wonderful life with your husband.", "NTA enjoy your wedding your brother and his wife sound like a lot of unnecessary attention seeking drama."]}
