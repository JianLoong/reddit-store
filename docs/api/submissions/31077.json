{"id": 31077, "submission_id": "17wgkyd", "title": "AITA for not inviting my brother and his wife to my wedding", "selftext": "I 20f and my fiance 21m are planning our wedding and have decided not to invite my older brother 26m and his new wife 27f to our wedding. \n\nMy brother and his now wife got engaged shortly after I did, although they are better off with money than I am and got married this past month while we are still planning. My brother only invited our mother and his father, and refused to have me, our siblings, our grandmother or anyone else of our family attend his wedding. At first he told us it was because he wanted a child free wedding and that means grandma couldn't go because she is the go to child care and they wanted a small wedding, 10 guests each. Okay fine. \nHis wedding comes and passes and pictures are posted (btw my mom did not go). In these pictures his wife has almost her whole family is there, the youngest being 2 years old along with many other children. This made everyone in my family upset, along with that he wanted our mom to wear an olive green dress bc he said it would match his dads suit vest. When the pics came out no one had green, his dad had an ice blue vest, bridesmaids wore orange and groomsmen wore tan. My mom would've been the only one wearing green which was not told to her\n\nAlso him and his wife don't like the fact that I can have kids and they can't and they didn't want me and my children there to remind them, but they had other little kids and babies there. My brother and I used to be very close and now he won't talk to me and if he visits its for less than 30 mins.\n\nBut am I the asshole for not wanting him to be there for my wedding when the rest of my family will be?", "created_utc": 1700117738, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17wgkyd/aita_for_not_inviting_my_brother_and_his_wife_to/", "score": 217, "replies": ["NTA- they excluded you intentionally, so you did the same. What's fair is fair. I wouldn't jump to compulsions about the kid thing unless you really know but that doesn't really matter in this context imo. They were dicks so ef em", "NTA - eff your brother he and his wife sound gross", "NTA. At all. In the slightest. Have a wonderful wedding day.", "Congratulations and NTA \n\nHe didn\u2019t invite you so you are not obligated to invite him.", "NTA.\n\nThey set the precedent, family isn't automatically invited.  And based on their explicitly denying you (and most/all of your family) to come, they shouldn't expect to go to yours.  You've nothing to feel bad for, I'd not invite them either.", "NTA it\u2019s your wedding day, invite who you want.", "NTA.  Have a conversation with your brother (when you feel up to it).  Your wedding, you get to invite who you want.  Have a wonderful life!", "Definitely NTA. Sounds as if your joke of a \u201csister-in-law,\u201d has your brother henpecked .", "NTA\u2026. This is the consequence of his own actions \u2026..Congratulations", "Nta but you need to talk to him about this because that\u2019s his position. It\u2019s up to him to fix these issues between his side of immediate family and his wife.", "NTA I would not want him there either. Your brother sounds codependent.", "Your JNbrother and his JNWife burned the bridge with you and your family. You should save your invites for people who matter to you and value you and your fiance. \nHave a great wedding and a wonderful life with your husband.", "NTA enjoy your wedding your brother and his wife sound like a lot of unnecessary attention seeking drama.", "NTA - the best revenge is to enjoy yourself with you love ones who reciprocate.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister in law has fundamentally fractured the relationship between you and your brother.  I'm sorry that happened, but everything from here on out will be tainted by that.  Maybe in the future you two can reconcile but dude's got no right to be at your wedding after letting things develop like they did with his.", "NTA. It's your wedding, you can invite anyone you want, and you don't have to include him when he didn't include you.", "NTA. I would invite everyone that was not invited to his wedding lol.", "NTA - Your brother married what ancient folklore refers to as a \u201csuccubus.\u201d A female demon who seduces men often using sexual activity to drain them of any manhood they once possessed and unfortunately he will remain kept and neutered until someone can reveal the succubus\u2019 true hideous form, break the spell, and banish the succubus\u2019 \u201cblack-hole\u201d back to Lucifer. You\u2019ve got your work cut out for you\u2026sorry\ud83d\ude41", "NTA but by inviting him you get to take the moral high ground and feel extremely smug. That said you probably already do because orange and tan???", "NTA, your special day and your guest list.  One approach would be to reach out and invite him, because you were close before.  Alternatively make this a grudge kind of thing and your children and you possibly will miss having a relationship with him.", "Nta. They\u2019re super entitled to think they would be invited to your wedding when they excluded you from theirs.", "Go NC with him and be done with it. NTA", "No invite for them. NTA.", "NTA. You do not have to extend a courtesy you did not receive.", "No one in their right mind would say YTA unless there's other information not given lmao", "NTA", "NTA\n\nWhy would you even want him there after the way he treated his whole family for his wedding?", "Nta. They sound awful.", "He's surely not expecting an invite to your wedding....", "NTA, I don't know why people lie about this stuff and then post pictures on social media.", "Your poor Grandma also being dumped with the childcare !", "NTA and you don't even have to explain. When they (or someone else) object(s) you can act surprised. \"After how you (they) have handled your (their) wedding, why would you expect anything else?\"", "NTA - The question you need to ask yourself is, do you want him there? If the answer is no then the rest doesn\u2019t matter. Have the day you want with the people you want there. Congrats on the upcoming nuptials!", "NTA, but if you wanted to include him to show him how loving families operate, please do.  If he attends, tell him over and over that you are sorry he didn't have all these wonderful people supporting him on his big day, and that you hope he makes choices going forward that do not isolate himself from people who love him.", "NTA fuck him and his new wife. He made his choices and gave a big fuck you to you, your family, and mother with what he did at his wedding. I would cut him completely from your life. Your family should follow suit and shun him.", "Your brother maybe in an emotionally abusive situation\u2026.. his new wife seems be to be actively and quite consciously isolating him from his family\u2026.. tell him you will provide him with emotional support should he ever leave his emotionally abusive situation but you cannot forgive and forget his spinelessness and the callous disregard he has shown you and your loved ones during his wedding. You can tell him that you wish to be surrounded by love and respect on the day of your wedding and that his actions clearly show that him and his wife hold no such emotion or regard for you and are hence to be excluded. Wish him good bye,cut him out, go low contact and enjoy your wedding", "Why bother talking to the brother, just block him and move on. Go NC and don't tell him anything at all about your wedding plans, or anything else about your life. \n\nAsk the rest of your family to not tell him anything about your wedding, let him find out afterwards. Same for any kids you have. Either he has intentionally cut off his family, or his now wife pushed him to do it and he went along or didn't fight it, so there is now no reason for him to be told anything about any events in your life.", "It's still fault for letting his girl neuter him. I have no respect for a man like that."]}
