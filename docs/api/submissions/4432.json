YTA. \n\nGet some therapy, no blue hearts for you, you don't deserve them. \ud83d\ude24", "You are such a bad person.", "Yeah, bro. That's abuse. Especially for a man who identifies as straight. People like that exploit addicts. It's considered rape in a lot of circles. Your lack of empathy for your own family is really concerning.", "Only if he is currently sleeping with someone else. Or if he has an STD.", "No, it's not. \n\nHow does it affect anything now? And, most importantly, *it's not your information to share.*", "Why would it be important to know the gender of every person my SO hooked up with in the past?", "That\u2019s not your decision to make doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re tipsy or not", "Why should one know if their partner ever had a same sex sexual experience unless they're homophobic?", "1. It's STILL not your place to decide what HE discloses. \n\n2. You are clearly a sanctimonious AH who judges your brother's past. You can think it isn't homophobia all you want, but why are you so set on \"she has a RiGhT tO kNoW!!!\" Works you have make as big a deal of putting him if he said he'd slept with 5 women and it was actually 8? \n\nYou need to look into yourself and figure out why you dislike you brother. Perhaps stepping down from that high horse may give you a better perspective. YTA in a ginormous way.", "There\u2019s no \u201cmaybe\u201d about it. YOU WERE WRONG.", "I agree, but sexual history is not the same as testings.  \n\nSomeone can have STDs and should disclose it.  But who, where, and when they received it is no ones business.", "No, HIV phobia, the guy was having sex with men and using needle drugs, you don\u2019t have to be gay to have sex with men and get HIV from it.", "Or do you not know what the word risk means ?", "Your sexual past like every other experience shapes your personality. I want to know everything about my spouse, the good, the bad, and ugly. It builds trust in the relationship and helps to better understand your partner and why they act certain ways or have certain beliefs. Lying or omitting   Your past is exactly what is sounds like... dishonesty to a person who you trust and want to trust you.", "Disagree, if you\u2019re seriously dating someone you should know their sexual and non sexual past", "That's true, poor guy probably relived every traumatic experience when outed by his brother", "Nice edit risk wasn't there before, and btw you literally manufactured a reason why, no one even mentioned HIV in the post. So you're just trying to justify outing someone for no reason", "She didn\u2019t mention it, but using needle drugs and men having sex with men are known risk factors for HIV, did you think they weren\u2019t ? Weird I\u2019m pretty sure that comes up when you\u2019re getting screened for it", "Does the brother have HIV? If you don't know you're literally grasping at straws", "Lol yup grasping at straws. You nailed it broke dick", "Ad hominem nice."]}
