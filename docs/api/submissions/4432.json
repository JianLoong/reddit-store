It ISN'T  about sex it's about not giving their 'partner' their own right to consent and control their own life.

Addiction is hereditary, and it has been made clear that your brother has a past that he regrets, and you are much younger than him, but if you feel that any level of intoxication causes you to make a mistake that can seriously impact the life of a loved one, you should recalibrate your relationship with that substance.

You might not realise the long-term effect it has on you at the time if you're concentrating on the other person's well-being but it's important to manage your own trauma from that as well.", "THIS. I know many people are saying that it wasn't the brother's story to tell (and I agree with that take), but **addiction is a disease that affects a person's loved ones as well.** I'm sure he's still resentful toward his brother, and while this was the wrong way to go about that resentment (hence YTA), there may be very just cause for resentment there. Policing OP's tone and wording choice for a problem HE TOO LIKELY HAD TO DEAL WITH is itself tone-deaf, and it shows you've never dealt with a family member with addiction. \n\nThat said, absolutely the asshole for going about it the way OP did. May I suggest family therapy?", "Same here rox, 50 yrs clean, welcome home.", "Just gotta respect each other and let the world go round. OP does not understand or doesn't care.", "I think the Gfs anger is probably also partially from it being revealed in front of people. Like if my bf had been keeping it from me that he had slept with men before and was an addict, I really wouldn\u2019t care too much about him not telling me right away. But if other people were present when i found out he has been keeping it from me, and it was treated like a huge part of his life and something he liked rather than the truth, which is he was probably coerced into doing it the way op probably made it seem to an outsider, I\u2019d be embarrassed. \n\nJust because it\u2019s embarrassing to have the dirty laundry of your relationship (dirty here being that your bf wasn\u2019t being honest with you) in front of others.", "Thank you!  Unfortunately to have that kind of understanding I had to go through living with an addict (ex-fiance who was sober when we met, then relapsed two years into our relationship after we got engaged, and everything changed).  He put me through hell, so I understand completely OPs anger and resentment 100%, but I also understand that if someone does eventually get to a point where they get sober and are trying, throwing back in their face all the ugly, shameful things they did when using, isn't going to help them, nor is it going to make the pain they put you through go away.  It's just a way to try and hurt them, but it benefits no one.  There is no one who knows all about the shameful things done than a sober addict, which is why a lot of people don't get sober.  They don't want the clear head to think about what they have done.", "While I entirely agree with you that OP is the asshole and his behavior isn\u2019t excusable, the previous commenter didn\u2019t provide and excuse, they provided a possible *reason* and then a possible solution for said reason so that it doesn\u2019t happen again. I think the intention here is not to absolve OP of his asshole behavior, but to help him prevent asshole behavior in the future, which pointing fingers and bashing someone does not do. Sometimes we do need a harsh reality check, but I think providing some thoughtful advice with the intent of helping rather than judging (although, to be fair, that is not the point of this subreddit) can be more beneficial most of the time", "Totally.", "I mean he openly calls him a junkie. So it\u2019s clear he looks down on him at least a little bit", "\"They don't want the clear head to think about what they have done.\"\n\nThis explains a lot. Thank you.", " YTA", "It\u2019s more than just outing his brother. These interactions may not have really been consensual. He may have basically outed his brother as a victim before his brother was ready to tell anyone his story. It\u2019s pretty gross to not appreciate the nuance of this situation just to call his brother out. \n\nA def YTA", "Yes, but 1. the brother hadnt proposed yet, so maybe he was planning to tell her at the right moment 2. OP doesnt know why the brother said no during the game - maybe he didnt want OP's GF to know, which is 100% reasonable 3. None of this is OPs story to share", "if he\u2019s openly sober and they\u2019re in a serious relationship she probably knows generally what he went through as an addict. he does not have to divulge every single traumatic detail with his future partners.", "Keyword here is \"yet\". You don't know when or if the brother was gonna tell his gf.\n\nThe question here is not whether or not the brother is a bad person, the question is if OP's actions were justified and if he's an AH.\n\nHe's an ass. Just an ass.", "Why are you assuming that because he hasn\u2019t told the girlfriend he had coercive sex with men as a drug addict that he has told her nothing else whatsoever about his past?\n\nOP isn\u2019t privy to every conversation they\u2019ve had. It could be that he\u2019s told her everything but hadn\u2019t got to what he feels is the most shameful part of his history yet. Maybe he\u2019s still working through that in therapy and isn\u2019t ready, but he\u2019s told her a lot of the story.\n\nHer being shocked and surprised her boyfriend has slept with men doesn\u2019t mean she has no idea about his past at all. If my partner told me she\u2019d done sex work, when desperate for money - I would be extremely surprised by that. It wouldn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t know her at all. Just that there are parts of her (at times quite traumatic) life that she hasn\u2019t told me about yet, and from what I know of her, this is unlikely. (And if your partner is heterosexual, then it would be a shock, not necessarily in a negative sense - just something that you don\u2019t expect)", "I don\u2019t think OP should have publicly shared the sensitive information though. Of course, the brothers girlfriend definitely deserves to know, and I agree with you in a lot of respects but I think the appropriate thing would\u2019ve been to let it pass in the moment, but take the brother aside at the first opportunity, and say that if he doesn\u2019t tell her immediately about his past that then he will be left with no choice but to share the information with her soon. I think he should\u2019ve given his brother a chance just to come clean to his girlfriend in private. Also, from the perspective of both their health, his gf deserves to know about his history and both of them to get tested for transmissible diseases (more common in drug users and sex workers in general, not just because the relationships were homosexual). It does sound like the brother is in some phase of denial, so I think OP potentially would\u2019ve been put in a position to have to tell the girlfriend anyway, but perhaps when sober and after giving brother a chance to tell her himself.", "That\u2019s a lot for someone who doesn\u2019t know the status of his relationship. He \u201cthinks\u201d he might propose? He didn\u2019t say \u201ctalked about proposing\u201d or even mentioned proposing while mysteriously not including how long they were dating. You fell for his phony justification and it sounds like you fell for it willingly. How the fck does some merely think someone wants to propose?", "Yeah I was SA\u2019d several times to varying degrees before I got sober. I\u2019d be devastated if someone \u201ccorrected\u201d me about something someone had done TO me while I was blacked out. I was stuck around one SA-er for several days after and he thought it was very amusing to tell me what \u201cwe did\u201d and repeatedly recounted things he\u2019d done to me acting as if I was a huge freak. To have my own family member basically do that in a group of people would be so harmful and upsetting, to put it mildly.", "He\u2019s also young and immature. Sounds like he\u2019s lived a pretty protected and easy life and hasn\u2019t gained an ounce of wisdom. He should be thankful he\u2019s had it easy and learn to stfu.\n\nOP, you\u2019re definitely the AH. Grow up, dude.", "His brother is a RECOVERING addict, not a recovered addict. Most relapse in the first 5 years. It has only been 2. And even in AA they refer to themselves as recovering, not recovered, regardless of years. The cravings can last a lifetime. And lying about your past to someone you are intimate with puts them at risk. He didn't have to give her details, or even whether consensual or not, but when an intimate partner asks about who you have been with and you completely lie, that is not acceptable behavior regardless of the reason.", "You can't judge the brother to be an AH - you have no idea when he was going to tell her.  \nOP never stated that his brother WERE to get married, only that he THOUGHT the brother wanted to marry her...   \nOP should have kept his mouth shut and let the brother tell in his own time in a setting where both him and his GF was comfortable.", "I'm sorry that happened to you, but also thank you for sharing! \n\nI just can't believe OP thinks repeatedly dragging up his brother's past like that is okay.", "Absolutely. This post is a reminder to EVERYONE who overcomes addiction. Do not share it with others unless absolutely necessary. You will be judged and there is nothing to gain.", "For a long time I used this word like a sword. I do not anymore, but it took some therapy to get there. \n\nOP is the AH for sharing her brothers past to anyone.", "I refer to myself as an ex-junkie when helping with harm reduction. But when people know they are generally courteous enough to refer to me as a healed or clean ex-heroin addict. It just a courtesy that we all share. OP doesn't know any form of caring or courtesy and claims to be an advocate for Harm Reduction. He's totally clueless there too.", "That\u2019s the sad thing but OP don\u2019t see what he did was wrong\u2026 His brother finally got his life together found someone he was in love with only for OP to run his mouth and possibly ruin it this could possibly send brother into a relapse I hope brother and his girlfriend works things out and I hope OP girlfriend now sees his true colors..", "It does. If you have to choose between having sex and your health, the person giving you the choice is coercing you. Think about it from the other perspective, you see someone who is desperate and at the lowest point of their life. You're in a position to help them, but are only willing to do it in exchange for sex. That is certainly taking advantage of their desperation.", "I wish I had an award to give you. This spells it out so plainly. I agree 100%. \n\nYTA because that story wasn\u2019t yours to tell.", "I don't know if that world exists anymore.", "That isn\u2019t just true of sex work, but most work. Most people are working for basic survival and as such, are coerced into doing things that harm themselves or go against their morals. Just look at all the people forced to work while sick, or doing physical labor that destroys their body, or is part of an industry that is destroying the planet, or takes advantage of other people. People work in jobs rampant with abuse, but keep showing up because they feel they have no choice.\n\nSex work isn\u2019t any different, and it\u2019s fucked up that we look at it differently. Nobody should be forced into doing something when they aren\u2019t in a position to consent. Consent is important in all things, not just sex. That is the point of r/antiwork.", "Where the hell in anything I said did I excuse his behavior?  I have been in the OPs shoes.  I have lived through hell with an addicts.  I stayed well beyond wanting to because I wanted to get them help, but ultimately I learned that only they can help themselves and I couldn't continue to be taken down by them.  Even though I knew logically it was a disease didn't mean that his behavior in addiction didn't get me f-cking angry, but if he had gotten sober and was doing better I would have NEVER said anything to him like that, and if I did have resentments I would have spoken privately to him, not in front of a new girlfriend of his.  I thoroughly think the OP was the AH.  I get where the resentments come from, but he handled it horribly, sounds like he thinks he is better than his brother, and didn't accomplish anything but more damage in what he said.  So do not come for me unless you read carefully and understand what I was saying.  The brother the OP appears to think he is better than is a hell of a lot stronger of a human being for pulling himself up by the bootstraps and trying to get his life and health in order.", "This. It\u2019s just an important distinction.", "I get the impression she already knew about the addict part, it just seems to have been the gay sex that was a revelation. I kinda think if you don't have an issue with finding out about it in private, you shouldn't be embarrassed about it in company. Even if I found out he'd chosen to have completely consensual sex with other men before he met me, he's still the person I married, not a stranger who has sex with men. He doesn't need a huge trauma to make it ok to have slept with other men in the past.\n\nAgain, attempting to put myself in the situation, I think my first question would just be why he didn't feel comfortable telling me. And his reaction in this scenario would likely give away the fact that it wasn't entirely consensual or a period in his life he was proud of and we'd table that conversation (not argument) for in private where homophobic, pot-stirring, drunk relatives aren't involved.", "It wasn't even \"outing\" since the brother isn't gay. He essentially just told his darkest secret", "Seriously, you aren\u2019t under oath playing Never Have I Ever.", "Sex questions come up in that type of game, but I also think it\u2019s kind of an unspoken rule that you don\u2019t have to disclose trauma if you aren\u2019t ready to", "Confused why this isn\u2019t a more popular response on this one. Like: 100% it\u2019s not OP\u2019s trauma to share and they are AH for overstepping in such a major way.\n\nBUT\u2026 if I were brother\u2019s GF, I would be furious that didn\u2019t himself trust me with some pretty major pieces of his past. That would be a bigger red flag for me than the past sex work itself. It\u2019s not first date material, but by the time they are thinking about marriage, I would expect to know more or less everything about him. OP is vague about how much of Brother\u2019s past as an addict gf knew at all\u2014perhaps because he had previously assumed that she knew it all. I can pretty easily imagine a post by GF which would prompt everyone dogpiles on brother as TAH for keeping secrets and lying. \n\nESH", "There is not enough info here for what you're saying. The first sentence in the post is that OP and his brother aren't close. How much of what he \"thinks\" he knows is just exaggerated teenage gossip that he wants to believe because he was a kid when his brother was an addict and he's angry? OP isn't sure his brother is going to propose. There is no info on how long the brother has even been dating this girl. It could be a relatively new relationship and the brother is just really impressed by her and thinking of eventually proposing.", "Yes I have lived with an addict and still have to fight the urge to get angry at them. Someone I loved very much and now have to fight the urge not to lash out at.", "I have lived with addicts my whole fucking life that have fucked me way over, but I would never randomly out them for no reason. I think OP is just an asshat who should get over himself", "I don\u2019t know, I think it was just the extent his brother would go to for his addiction in general. Sleeping with men is just what\u2019s relevant for this post, but OP didn\u2019t seem to be judging that any more than just \u201cwhat his brother did for drugs\u201d", "Hate the game, not the player!", "I don\u2019t agree with the last part. If she married him and he relapses (entirely possible as all recovered people will acknowledge), it\u2019s very unfair that she didn\u2019t know about his past addiction and the odds of this happening. Because being married to an addict will cause her trauma. It\u2019s like having very high odds for a terrible terminal illness and not telling your partner b/c it might not happen.", "The things someone did during active addiction should ABSOLUTELY be shared. The brother obviously has more work to do if he's still lying."]}
