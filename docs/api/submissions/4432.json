Instead of choosing someone out of 50% of the population they choose you out of 100% of the population. Don\u2019t use your personal feelings to say \u201cmost women\u201d. I\u2019m a woman and you\u2019re definitely wrong.", "What sexual abuse she said nothing about sexual abuse.", "Because you are being outwardly homophobic and can\u2019t even recognise it, hence the lack of self awareness", "Yeah, uh, that's called homophobia.", "Didn't say you were just thinking like one", "Where does it say he used needles? And who said it was unprotected? This is very presumptuous of you", "Why?", "No.. you're entitled to know if your partner has anything you could contract. You are NOT ENTITLED to know someone's sexual history just because you slept with them or are in a relationship. If they want to disclose that then fine. Does their past make them undatable if there's something you don't like? \n\n\"I'm sorry Jim. You took it up the ass one so I can't date you even tho it HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.\"", "You\u2019re moving the goalposts there, buddy: you originally said \u201cmonogamous and/or physical relationship\u201d and now you\u2019re saying \u201cspouse\u201d. I agree that if someone isn\u2019t ready to disclose, then they\u2019re not ready to marry. But that\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean someone *has* to disclose when they get in a relationship.", "So\u2026 this belief is very common in some religious and conservative circles. However, many many people don\u2019t view it like this. And being married to someone and dating someone are not the same things. \n \nIn general, outside of conservative religions or cultures, people are only entitled to know if you have a communicable disease. No one has to tell anyone else about specific numbers, types, etc. \n \nYour choice to refrain from sexual activity until marriage does not have any bearing on anyone else\u2019s choice.", "Ok but uh\u2026 how does that conversation go exactly? Do you tell your potential dates how many partners you\u2019ve had? Do you expect them to tell you? \n \nI don\u2019t want to know, and I\u2019d be *pissed* if a potential date asked me that question and I\u2019d end any kind of relationship with them right then. \n \nThe number and type of partners doesn\u2019t matter. That\u2019s some purity culture BS. What matters is what is their health status now.", "I agree with what you are saying about his privacy should be a conversation with his girlfriend.  But thats the main point, no one is defending the drug use, the main problem is the invasion of privacy.\n\nThe issue with your reasoning is that you are assuming he has lied to his girlfriend before they started dating.  We don't know that information.  It could be that he said he had a troubled past, but not go into detail.  We don't know, none of us here is the brother nor girlfriend.  It is also not our place to state that someone else had sex with someone if we were never present for that intercourse, its all based on assumptions.  \n\nIt is not our place to find the truth, but only use the information we are given in the text on the situation that happened.  \n\nYou can say hes a liar and that can be true, but he was put in a position where he wasn't ready to go into detail ON A PERSONAL HISTORY and had a right to refuse to speak.  \n\nEveryone has at least one secret, including you, that is no one else's business to disclose but only themselves.  It is not lying if its refusing to disclose information at a moment when it wasn't the right time.", "But that\u2019s your opinion and that\u2019s 100% fine. But there are a lot of women who don\u2019t want to be with a man who has willingly had sex with other man and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that either.", "From what I have gathered from the post, there was an element of sexual coercion in the relationship between OP\u2019s brother and the people he got drugs/drug money from.", "So if a women turns down a man because he has slept with men in the past then that person is homophobic?", "Addicts and John\u2019s always use the utmost caution you\u2019re right", "So many circumstances. Me personally, I would not date a woman with a high body count (Before you say anything I hold myself to the same standards). A lot of girls may not want to date a man who has had gay sex. Vice Versa is also true.", "If it was a deal breaker for her, or if he's lied to her directly about it, I feel like that's a problem, keeping it from her?\n\nI'm not saying it's an appropriate deal breaker to have, but some people are pretty bigoted and I wouldn't want to be with one of them.", "So are you just saying that they choose to omit or do you think it\u2019s acceptable to outright lie?", "I'm not moving the goal post. For me monogamous relationship and spouse are the literal same thing. I don't believe you need to be married to be in a committed relationship, you don't have to be married to have a spouse or partner. If you aren't ready to disclose, you are not ready to fck(which leads to children and lifelong commitment), I also don't think you can be in a committed relationship, while actively being a liar. Lmao seems a lot of people think you can. Probably why relationship don't last now days.", "Nope. I don't tell dates how many partners I've had. I do tell them if we become serious and sexual and yes I do expect them to disclose and if they don't want to that's fine. They aren't for me, and the relationship can end there. That's how it should be, because we are not compatible. So weird how it's appropriate to say some one is on purity bs for having their own standards when it comes to sexual partners, but if someone were to say people who sleep with randoms are on some nasty bs that would be wrong. (I don't even feel that way, just pointing out the hypocrisy). I also don't want to be with someone who has foot fetish or who is religious asf.  Idk why people are trying to justify making the choice to take someone else's away.", "Yeah there is something wrong with that. It\u2019s homophobic. If you\u2019re fine with a man that\u2019s had sex with a woman before you should be fine with a man who had sex with a man before. You\u2019re either homophobic or you\u2019re not.", "A lot is not most", "Yes, why is it such a big deal? If you found out someone you were dating had slept with 50 women you\u2019d be fine, but 1 man in that mix and all bets are off?\n\nYou are outright saying gay people are not masculine and you lose respect for anyone you find out is gay. See where the homophobia comes into play? I don\u2019t understand how sexual preference makes someone more or less masculine", "You're literally assuming everything with no basis in reality", "Did you just use the term \u201cbody count\u201d when referring to sexual partners and expect to be taken seriously?", "Doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re entitled to that specific knowledge. It means that you sit down with your partner and when you guys decide that yes, this is a serious relationship, you lay out what your dealbreakers are. If someone lies, well, they\u2019re in the wrong. But they don\u2019t have to lay out the truth in detail in order to honestly say that the relationship needs to end or even to say that there are pieces of their past they\u2019re not yet ready to open up about. \n\nAnd honestly, sleeping with people to feed your addiction? That\u2019s not consensual. You don\u2019t have to add that to your body count.", "I struggle personally to understand how a person's sexual past can be a deal break for a relationship. Unless they have some illegal fucked up fetish how can you really sit there and judge them? (Not you specifically but the whole world) \n\nBut, if for whatever reason it's a deal breaker for your partner to have some kind of specific sexual past or whatever. Then just be clear about it in the beginning. \n\nAnd no lying isn't right. And if she HAD asked him outright and he had lied to her about it knowing it would make a difference then he's in the wrong. But not wanting to share something he wasn't comfortable sharing, and with someone who hadn't made it clear it makes a difference. I don't see any wrong doing here other than OP being an ah for spilling beans that weren't his to spill and doing it in a condescending way and trying to blame it on alcohol. \n\nAnd yes I fully believe that if you have problems with potential partners having certain sexual encounters or any sexual encounters. You NEED to be upfront at the beginning. That's important. Like really important. Don't want to date someone only to find out that they thought you were a virgin but never asked, and now you're treated like a whore cus they never bothered to have a conversation with you about it beforehand. \n\nAnd this goes for any and all topics that are \"deal breaker\" topics. Religion, politics, how to hang the toilet paper roll. Have those conversations BEFORE getting deeply involved. If you have hard limits then they need to be very clear at the beginning. \n\n(Am I making sense???)", "Why do you believe you deserve to know EVERYTHING about your partner??? \n\nIf you ask them \"tell me all your dirty sexual secrets\" and they respond \"I'm sorry I'm not comfortable telling you everything that's happened in my life, but you're safe and have nothing to worry about\" (as in an STD) how do you justify demanding to know more, without making it sound like you're homophobic or judgmental as hell??\n\nI'm not disagreeing that knowing the history of someone you want to live your life with isn't unreasonable. But people are not entitled to a person's whole story just because they are dating or sleeping together. \n\nAnd If a person's sexual past is that important to you then just be upfront about it. \"I'm sorry I can't date someone who can't be completely honest and open about their past\" because you ARE NOT ENTITLED to someone's story. Period.", "Being monogamous or being physical and being committed aren\u2019t the same thing either. It\u2019s still moving goal posts.", "Is this OP\u2019s other account? People can fck who they want without the children and marriage. What about one night stands? \u201cHey person I plan to sleep with tonight and never see again. Here is my body count.

I was asking you a question and you went on a bit of a diatribe. I have a vague knowledge of my husband\u2019s sexual past and am comfortable with what I know. I asked questions as things came up and vice versa. I never asked him to lay out his whole sexual history but have asked if he\u2019s had one night stands, weirdest sexual encounter, ever faked an orgasm etc\u2026to me it\u2019s no different than where have you travelled, ever been arrested, any food allergies etc\u2026while the answers themselves aren\u2019t important hearing the truth is (idk if that makes sense to you).", "You can fck who you want, I could careless. I don't do one-night stands, and I don't want to be with someone who does or has, that's my opinion and nmy choice. Maybe the gf doesn't want to be with an ex-prostitute.
