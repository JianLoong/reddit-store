He also definitely doesn\u2019t need to be such a drama queen about it. Paying for his pizza? Ridiculous. \n\nIt does sound like you need to revisit that initial decision though. I have a lot of weird food issues so my husband and I almost always had separate meals. It sounds like your husband needs to be responsible for his own meals.", "Do you have a job and pay for the food?  Or is he the breadwinner and you SAH?\n\nI ask because if I was living with someone and was paying for everything and they made a routine of just cooking something I won't eat and telling me 20 minutes before the meal 'Just order yourself something' I might at some point ask if you were using money I was giving to just feed yourself.", "NTA. Start grading him in bed and see how he likes it", "Grading your cooking?  I'm no psychic but, 'stares into the crystal ball',  I see red flags waving in the wind\n\nYou are NTA.\n\nHe is, if only for having to go to his 'mommy' for help backing up his entitled view, TAH.\n\n15 years you've put up with this? You need one hell of a vacation..", "NTA my guy does 0% of the cooking. the absolute gall he has to grade ur food (and you've asked him multiple times to stop!!) and then order shit instead of eat what you've spent time and care preparing and THEN demanding u pay for his childish food issues AND THEN GETTING HIS MOTHER INVOLVED!?!?!?!? how the hell have u been married to this man for 15 years he sounds insufferable \ud83e\udd22", "NTA! Wish I'd done this when I was married. No eggs or veggies/beans/peppers for 23 long years lol. Seriously though, this grading? Who does he think he is??", "NTA: are you his wife or his mother?", "NTA", "OP your husband is very rude. It sounds like it is time he learned to cook, or he can starve, or he can pay for his own takeaways or mommy can cook for him, but there is no way you should carry on cooking for his ungrateful ass. NTA", "NTA\n\nAre you his wife, or his mom?\n\nBeing married, doesnt mean, that you cant eat things you like, just because the other one doesnt like it. Than he can eat something different this time.\n\nHe is a grown aduld, if dont likes what you cooked, he can go and make his own food. \n\nhow bold, to expect that you should pay for the ordered food. And also to expect, that you cook only things HE likes.\n\nHe rates your food? wtf...", "Your husband is childish. You've asked him to stop grading your meals, but nope...because he's got an 8th grader's mentality. He even ran to his mommy to tell on you.\n\nTell him to cook for himself until he can sit at the grown up dinner table and conduct himself like an adult.", "NTA if my fianc\u00e9 graded all my meals him he would be in a world of shit. On a similar note, my ex-husband didn\u2019t like my cooking. I made a cheese log recipe as an appetizer for something, a recipe in my family that\u2019s been a hit with so many people (not just family) he didn\u2019t like it. I made him a beer cheese dip one day (also something I\u2019d gotten rave reviews on) he didn\u2019t like it. I made him potato corn chowder because he preferred cream soups and you guessed it, he didn\u2019t like it. Those are just a few examples. My fianc\u00e9 loves all of those things as well as the other food I make him. He even sends me recipes for us to try together. OP I am sorry your husband doesn\u2019t like your food. Don\u2019t cook for him. He\u2019s ungrateful.", "NTA, grading your spouse\u2019s cooking is demented! Tell him good luck in cooking A+ meals yourself!", "Better yet tell him to go eat at his mom's nta", "She's doing all the cooking, she can make things according to her own palate on occasion. He's a grown man refusing to take any responsibility for feeding himself while being as picky as he is, demanding she pays for his food if he gets takeout because he doesnt like what's served AND getting his mommy involved.", "My exhusband is a Narcissist and he refused to eat leftovers as well. Even a leftover of his favorite dish.", "100% agree! I live on Madras lentils and jasmine rice.", "I would have loved that. At my house it was eat or eat when I was younger. You are not allowed to leave your place until you have finished your plate. In the good days, only half is mandatory. My mum was on my back, because at the nursery and school, I was eating (almost) everything they served, but not at home \ud83d\ude43"]}
