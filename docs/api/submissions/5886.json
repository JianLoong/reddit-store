His \"limited palate\" does not give him carte blanche to demand that all food fit his preferences. It sucks when you don't get to eat good food because someone else refuses to try new things. Tell him what I tell my kids: I'm making one healthy filling meal for all of us, and if you choose not to eat it, there's PB&J or cereal in the pantry and fruit in the bowl. If you want to be really accommodating, you can agree that you will cook the food he wants \"n\" days a week -- where \"n\" is a number that works for you.\n\nAnd his \"I don't eat leftovers\" thing is nonsense. Leftovers are efficient and they cut down on cost and work for the cook. Demanding a from-scratch meal every single day is selfish as heck.

It's also not appropriate for him to try to dictate what you cook or to expect you to pay for his takeout when you are already doing the majority of the cooking. It's important for both partners in a relationship to be considerate of each other's needs and preferences, but it's not fair for one person to expect the other to completely alter their own preferences or habits to accommodate them.

If you didn\u2019t want to eat what was being served you didn\u2019t have to eat or you could eat carrot sticks and apples. The chef chooses the menu.
