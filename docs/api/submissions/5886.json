So I don\u2019t cook it for my husband, and he doesn\u2019t cook it for me.\n\nBut what he can do is cook his own fish, and I\u2019ll cook something for me that he doesn\u2019t really like, like an eggplant dish.", "I find it annoying that so many immature people call their parents in on a disagreement with their spouse/SO. Seriously I personally would not tolerate this behavior. NTA", "*some nights it's something I know he doesn't like*\n\nlemme get this straight- you specifically cook things you know he won't like, then get pissed when he doesn't like it and come on reddit to complain about him behind his back? \n\nseriously? \n\n*seems like the list of things he doesn't like just keeps getting longer.*\n\ngee, I wonder why? \n\n  \nyet another reddit marriage headed for divorce. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA", "Agreed. My father is a narcissist and he also will not eat leftovers. It\u2019s a combo of control and seeing leftovers as something poor people eat. OP\u2019s hubby sounds like a narc who was brought up by a mommy narc.", "Take it or leave it - Exactly.  Although I think I would cook curry nearly daily at that point.  F=fabulous you know, D=delicious, C=can't live without it", "My mum used to say, kindly, \u201cwell, you can do the other thing\u2026\u201d", "I don\u2019t even understand that that means to ask his wife to pay for his takeout. Is he financially abusing OP and gives her limited money that she controls on her own and he wants to take it from that? Do they have separate finances? I have so many questions.", "Right!? My son is only 14, but when he's an adult I would straight up tell him to grow up and deal with his issues on his own. If he needs advice that's one thing, but man I would never get involved unless there was abuse going on.", "Right! So insulting\u2026 why haven\u2019t they discontinued this particular model of husband and replaced it with a less buggy version?", "My question too.  Has this been going on for 15 years?", "At my house (when I was a kid) it was \"eat what's on your plate, or you can go ask the neighbors for dinner.\"", "I bet they\u2019re SO GOOD!", "Oh, I know! It\u2019s not a \u201cmake the husband happy\u201d solution, it\u2019s a spend even less effort on this absolute toilet of a man solution.", "She\u2019ll do it for him", "She'll break hubby's arms."]}
