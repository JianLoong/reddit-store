I never really wanted them growing up but I figure I\u2019ll eventually have kids in the future once I get my life together. My cousin Sarah (29) has two bad behaved kids from a previous relationship and a newborn baby with her boyfriend MJ (40).\n\nLast night my mother, sister, Sarah and I went to a sushi restaurant - and this was my first time having sushi. After we ordered, I had a hard time using the chopsticks. My cousin started obnoxiously laughing. \n\nThe waiter came over and asked me if I wanted \u201ctraining wheels\u201d which is a little plastic item that attaches to the chopsticks and helps you hold them in place. My cousin laughed and said \u201csorry about her, she constantly embarrasses herself and us.\u201d\n\nI just gave her the side eye and put the training wheels on. When it was time to order desserts, her boyfriend MJ finally joined us - claiming that he was \u201cbusy.\u201d\nShe went on to tell him how \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201cslow\u201d I was for not knowing how to use chopsticks and how the waiters and everyone around now know that I\u2019m an embarrassment. My mom asked her what her problem was and she goes on a rant about how I\u2019m so embarrassing and it\u2019s no wonder I\u2019m \u201cjealous of her being a mother\u201d and \u201cno one wants to have kids with me.\u201d \n\nI finally had enough. I said \u201cI don\u2019t have kids because I don\u2019t want them to come out like your rude pieces of shit\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re calling me an embarrassment? Didn\u2019t MJ just have a baby on you with his wife? Your baby literally has a sibling a week apart from her. You probably learned how to use chopsticks by eating his wife\u2019s leftovers.\u201d\n\nI guess when she was attacking me it was fine because everyone turned on me. \nIt got so loud that management had to get involved. Sarah was screaming and crying, MJ was yelling at me, and my mom and sister were berating me for being \u201cmean.\u201d \n\nManagement brought the bill and told us to please pay it and leave. My mom paid the entire bill but my sister said I\u2019m an AH for embarrassing Sarah and getting us kicked out - and how she\u2019s probably going through postpartum depression. \n\nNow\u2026idk if I went too far seeing as she\u2019s probably going through some post baby stress.

I never really wanted them growing up but I figure I\u2019ll eventually have kids in the future once I get my life together. My cousin Sarah (29) has two bad behaved kids from a previous relationship and a newborn baby with her boyfriend MJ (40).\n\nLast night my mother, sister, Sarah and I went to a sushi restaurant - and this was my first time having sushi. After we ordered, I had a hard time using the chopsticks. My cousin started obnoxiously laughing. \n\nThe waiter came over and asked me if I wanted \u201ctraining wheels\u201d which is a little plastic item that attaches to the chopsticks and helps you hold them in place. My cousin laughed and said \u201csorry about her, she constantly embarrasses herself and us.\u201d\n\nI just gave her the side eye and put the training wheels on. When it was time to order desserts, her boyfriend MJ finally joined us - claiming that he was \u201cbusy.\u201d\nShe went on to tell him how \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201cslow\u201d I was for not knowing how to use chopsticks and how the waiters and everyone around now know that I\u2019m an embarrassment. My mom asked her what her problem was and she goes on a rant about how I\u2019m so embarrassing and it\u2019s no wonder I\u2019m \u201cjealous of her being a mother\u201d and \u201cno one wants to have kids with me.\u201d \n\nI finally had enough. I said \u201cI don\u2019t have kids because I don\u2019t want them to come out like your rude pieces of shit\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019re calling me an embarrassment? Didn\u2019t MJ just have a baby on you with his wife? Your baby literally has a sibling a week apart from her. You probably learned how to use chopsticks by eating his wife\u2019s leftovers.\u201d\n\nI guess when she was attacking me it was fine because everyone turned on me. \nIt got so loud that management had to get involved. Sarah was screaming and crying, MJ was yelling at me, and my mom and sister were berating me for being \u201cmean.\u201d \n\nManagement brought the bill and told us to please pay it and leave. My mom paid the entire bill but my sister said I\u2019m an AH for embarrassing Sarah and getting us kicked out - and how she\u2019s probably going through postpartum depression. \n\nNow\u2026idk if I went too far seeing as she\u2019s probably going through some post baby stress.

This would be the most exciting thing to happen to me in months!", "OP\u2019s burn was so hot, it popped everybody\u2019s popcorn table side!", "Ladies don\u2019t start fights but they can finish them - The Aristocats", "Yeah and in the US if you kick out rowdy patrons you might get shot so nobody likes situations that escalate quickly like this in public.", "While my grandmother would have been outwardly appalled, she\u2019d be talking about this to everyone she knew. I\u2019d call that a successful day out just for the drama factor.", "Yea also highly depends on how much tea I was able to hear. If it was just obnoxious and I was spending a ton of money I\u2019d prob be annoyed but if I could make out what was actually happening I\u2019d find it entertaining, especially if I heard the line about eating his wife\u2019s leftovers. Lol", "Especially if you work there!", "This is so me \u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f\u2620\ufe0f It\u2019s *so* easy to whip out something devastating lol", "Okay innocently saying \"good naked\" for \"good night\" is just adorable", "Redditor reading comprehension challenge (impossible)", "And the balls to treat this original poster like that in public, in front of her own mom and I\u2019m guessing in front of these rude unruly children who are being taught to treat their Auntie with disrespect as well. Not the asshole.", "Did you climb on top of the sink...? Just trying to figure out the logistics...", "My source is living  in Japan since the \u201890s, and both fingers and chopsticks are common. Fingers are traditional.\n\nChildren and teens and younger adults and working-class people seem more likely to use chopsticks from what I\u2019ve noticed, so how common you perceived it to be during your visit may relate to the company you kept or sort of restaurants you went to.\n\nBut again, you will see both styles used by various people at both cheap and high-end places. It\u2019s personal preference, but fingers is the traditional way.", "That may have been your experience but I lived in Japan for three years and ate at sushi restaurants and we typically did use our fingers. I used chopsticks for some of the messier rolls but nigiri, sashimi, and most of the standard rolls, just fingers.\n\nI also don\u2019t think they were clowning anyone. I think they were just reassuring OP that you don\u2019t need to know how to use chopsticks to eat sushi.", "I have it on a pin \ud83d\ude07", "\u201cShe\u2019s dead, Jim!\u201d", "Lol literal MF", "She was probably coming up with them the entire dinner and finally snapped haha", "This line is so good that I don\u2019t believe they said it.", "This is pretty much where I was. Also, it appears OP taught the ever important rule of living in glass houses.", "I would like to point out that in Japan, *most* people eat sushi with their hands\u2026", "Sounds like the kind of thing op thought of in the shower later", "Literally.", "I was shocked this didn\u2019t end with \u201cand everyone applauded me, and server comped my bill with a wink before asking us to leave\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is, this didn\u2019t happen.", "The best tip I ever got for using chopsticks was to keep the bottom one motionless and maneuver with the top.\n\nNow as for OP\u2019s comment about leftovers, that was frigging magnificent.", "Also guaranteed the restaurant didn't give a shit about OP not being able to use chopsticks - they have the training wheels readily available for a reason.", "brb", "Honest question. Are depressed people \u2018mean\u2019? Because I have been depressed for such a long period but I never felt like underestimating someone else. Fck, I have troubles to get up. Maybe I am doing the depression wrong\n\nOP, doesn\u2019t look like depression to me. She is just mean and you put her in place. \n\nI was laughed at because I wasn\u2019t able to use chopsticks. In a restaurant, in front of the others. I started to practice it at home. I am perfectly able to use them now. Was it worth it? I have no answer\u2026", "Ok we all love her sassy comebacks but\u2026 there\u2019s a whole spectrum between doormat and highroad and going nuclear like she did.", "I know, right?  that was a black belt burn!!", "I have had to ask people to leave a restaurant before (I work in service) and it is so, so unfun. It takes a LOT for us to ask you to leave. If you are asked to leave, you need to fucking go now because if you don\u2019t, a large man will come unceremoniously toss you out the door. I am not kidding.", "I'd just find myself saying \"fuck sushi, this drama needs some popcorn,\" and it would only be a little bit because I don't like sushi.", "I think they mean if you know someone is just always nasty and doing it for your reaction, you shouldn't give them the satisfaction of reacting and stooping to their level. But that's definitely easier said than done", "Their logic is that \"the bullied one shouldn't fight back and just take it in order to keep the peace\"", "Sometimes is easy to give a good comeback. But the truly great comebacks are the ones when the recipient doesn't fully realize they've been completely insulted until they're in the shower the next day. Hard to do but fun when you get it right.", "Now this is just my own weird thinking here, but\u2026if I take the high road and they take the low road I will have an easier time throwing poop on them from above. I will become the pigeon of the high road.", "More people need to be comfortable with the fact that being good doesn\u2019t mean being nice. \n\nYou can be a good person without being a doormat.", "I mispronounce caterpillar every single time to this day. For the life of me I cannot understand how putting the word pillar behind the word cater causes cater to be pronounced differently. At this point, I\u2019ve been mispronouncing it on purpose for like 45 years. Someone made fun of me when I was little and said it wrong, and I will die on the \u201csmushing two words together shouldn\u2019t change the pronunciation of either word\u201d hill forevermore.", "*cousin", "Doesn't everyone's drunk ass do this? Lol", "Oh fuck you've put it into words", "You've gotta teach people how to treat you", "Exactly.

I've been looking at some for a long time but seeing so many different reviews saying they don't work or light up has made me too nervous to get some.", "Fianc\u00e9 and I would\u2019ve taken bets on who threw the first punch\u2026\n\nBut if I was out with my shitty MIL it would\u2019ve been real bad so I get why people are saying everyone is yucky.", "I had a school teacher who remarked something similar when I saw a girl crying in the bathroom and was leaving laughing. Completely unrelated but teacher thought it was related and said \"she doesn't cry, she makes others cry\"\nTbh that has stayed with me for last 20 years.. i don't take shit from anybody", "Yeah i would go no contact with that evil woman lol. Frankly, it\u2019s distressing that somehow OP is at fault? I wouldn\u2019t spend time around people who think it\u2019s okay for me to be treated badly.", "That way you can surprise attack from underground. They\u2019ll never expect it!", "I did not know that! I would say that knowing that will change my view, but it probably won\u2019t. I\u2019ve been deliberately mispronouncing it for 45 years, so it\u2019s just habit now. Now I\u2019m just going to call my cat a caterpillar, and I will pronounce it properly!", "I feel like I should order these for when my friend's kid visits. That girl loves her training chopsticks! Thanks!", "It doesn't say the kids were there, but the cousin is the epitome of jealous and bitter and MJ has MAJOR GALL", "My dads was , girl, never start it, but ALWAYS finish it so they don't come back for more.

But it is not the usual, and is not usual in the high end restaurants there.\n\nThe average 100 (now 130) yen per sushi place has most people using chopsticks, at least in big cities. There is probably some recent influence from \"sushi terrorism\" (some guy on tiktok who was licking sushi on the rotating belt).", "I wouldn\u2019t trust a random website any more than a random redditor.  In that spirit, [here is another random site](https://youmesushi.com/sushi-etiquette-chopsticks-fingers/) that says \u201cpretty much everyone you see out and about in Japan will indeed be using chopsticks to eat their sushi.\u201d", "Ddaaaaammnn that totally slipped by me, I'm kid free and never deal with that kind of drama.
