I was thrown on a new project into the project manager role at 4pm and told that there would be a meeting of everyone on the project (15 people) the very next day starting at 1pm.  Someone had to get everything ready for the project meeting, and guess whose job it was!  Guess who didn't even know what the project was about and wasn't told why the meeting was being held?  Seriously; I got a text and then when I sent questions I got no reply.  Okay, fine.  I'm a big girl, I can prepare for this giant meeting on the fly.  Stayed until 9pm, got into the office at 6am, at noon this asshole walks into the office and catches me as I'm flying by and informs me that \\*\\*someone\\*\\* has to go buy snacks.  I looked at him and said \"John, I'm not getting lunch; I don't have time for other people's snacks.  There's a store downstairs and vending machines.  I can either get this meeting ready, or I can buy snacks for people perfectly capable of getting their own.\"  Found out later that while I was seeing myself as a project management professional, he was seeing me as female, and females (specifically females, not women) are in charge of getting food.  He was very disturbed that I didn't see \"snacks\" as one of my primary responsibilities, especially since I was the only ~~woman~~ female on the team.\n\nI still don't care about other people's snacks.

Customer said no. OP was not involved in the conversation at all. Director then comes out and yells at OP for not getting any drinks? Wtf? Drinks were neither wanted nor requested. \n\nWas OP supposed to magically read his coworkers mind, and think \u201coh, well director asked customer if they want a drink because director actually wants a drink. I should stop my work, run out, figure out what drink director wants, then bring it to him without asking, even though that is not in my job description whatsoever!\u201d Lmao and the guy is his equal! If I did this for my BOSS, who is definitely NOT my equal, he would be mad because he knows I have important work to do AND because the customer said no. You always offer refreshments to office guests, and if they say no, then it\u2019s a no for you too. You don\u2019t bitch about wanting coffee when your customer already said no to coffee. You wait til the meeting is over and get it yourself.", "NTA\n\nYou are a professional, not an errand runner.  \n\nIf it is this bad now, imagine how bad it would be if you were female?  Sounds to me like your colleague is just an AH", "NTA.  You should be treated with the same respect that everyone else gets.", "Just gotta be the change you wanna see in the world, NTA. I had a help desk job that tried to claim it was the opener's job to make coffee for the engineers, I explained I don't drink the coffee there and wouldn't be making it. Never had to make coffee.", "NTA - Tell them to get their own damn drinks as you are too busy, duh.", "In a healthy, functioning workplace, it wouldn\u2019t be out of the question for coworkers to grab each other drinks. This is clearly not one of those workplaces. \n\nFirst, coworkers getting drinks for one another should always be the result of either a polite request (which can be refused) or a polite offer (likewise). Second, it should rotate as a reciprocal responsibility to one another throughout the office, not be assigned to one person because of age or status (or any other factors, like sex or race, these are just the ones relevant here). Clearly, this is not the case, and OP is being harassed because of his age. \n\nWhen people talk about the hyper-individualism often present on Reddit and especially AITA, I often think of posts like these \u2014 which are all too common in the real world. I wonder how much of it is people experiencing circumstances like this for a long time and finally coming to the conclusion that they will do exactly what they are legally/contractually obligated to do and *no more,* because they\u2019re sick and tired of being bullied and taken advantage of by their workplace (and perhaps their family and friends, too).", "Did you read the post?

If that doesn't work, reach out to HR. - NTA", "NTA  \n\n\nI could see an argument being made where, in a small company trying to get a bit contract they want to impress the client and offer them drinks.   If you're the least experienced around / lowest salary it would make sense for that to become your role on the team.    \n\n\nBut that doesn't explain the ridiculously passive aggressive way he stormed out to get the drinks lol.  I wouldn't take that shit either.    \n\n\nIf my managements expectation, is that they're entitled to disrespect me, they're going to have to pay me a hell of a lot more for that privilege.  For context, I'm also an engineer.  I can go to a competing company with the snap of my fingers, so I dare them.", "Nta. Fucking sales people.", " Nah, they are too old and decrepit to walk a few feet for drinks.", "In this situation though, there's no reason to thin anyone even ASKED OP to get drinks.", "I agree. That\u2019s what I meant by saying that he was harassed, not asked."]}
