Evie was very excited when she was invited, and I was 100% going to let her go - with one condition. This family is one of those social media families that posts their entire life publicly. They don't have a crazy huge following (I think it's around 5k on tiktok) but it's still a substantial amount and everything is public. When discussing Evie potentially coming with them, the mom (33F) who we will call \"Sarah\" was very offended when I said I was happy to let Evie join, I just asked that they not post her on their social media. I make a point to not post my children (I also have an infant son) on social media, with the exception of a private account that only close friends and family follow). I do this because there are a lot of predators and bad actors online, and I don't feel comfortable with my children's photos being available to them.\n\nAnyway, Sarah accused me of calling her a bad mom after she pestered me for my reasoning. She also said it wouldn't be possible for Evie to not be posted online because she would be doing \"live\" videos for much of the day. We went back and forth trying to find a solution/compromise but Sarah wouldn't budge. I decided to decline the invite. \n\nObviously, Evie is very upset and of course doesn't understand why she can't go. We have made a plan to take her and whatever friend she wants later this summer to make up for it, which has helped, but she is still upset about not joining her friend and their family. I have had 2 other moms in our \"parent friend group\" tell me I'm making too big of a deal out of the social media thing, but they're also people who post everything publicly. \n\nWhat do you guys think, AITA? Should we have just let her go? If it matters, we were going to be paying all of Evie's expenses on the trip.\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for all of your responses, I did not expect this to get so much attention! I really appreciate your insights and I am reading all of your comments, good and bad. I am new to the term \"sharenting\" and have definitely learned a lot here that has solidified my confidence in my choice. I am going to have a good talk with my daughter, as some suggested, about social media and privacy, as she is getting to the age where her peers will surely be getting social media accounts soon. Also, I am not a helicopter mom and my daughter is pretty free to be who she wants to be and participate in activities she chooses to, there are just certain boundaries we have in place, and being live-streamed to strangers on the internet is one of them. \n\n\nThanks again all!", "created_utc": 1685549161, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13wqc1m/aita_for_not_letting_daughter_go_to_a_theme_park/", "score": 1159, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Of course if she didn't want to do that, whatever, it's her trip, but she shouldn't be upset.", "NTA. You\u2019re a great parent for going the extra mile to protect your kid. Making up for it later this summer is more than enough!", "Wow, NTA. Thank you for being a good parent and protecting your children! People seriously underestimate the number of online predators that religiously follow \"family\" instagram accounts with young children.", "NTA\n\nKeeping your 8yo off of live social media streaming is a reasonable desire. If the other parents aren't going to agree to this, the 8yo isn't going with them.", "NTA - seems like the other mother took it personally when all you asked was for your child not to be on social media. I\u2019m assuming you didn\u2019t say anything about their own choices. If I had kids and when I do, I would be the same in wanting to limit their social media presence for security and safety.", "NTA.\n\nI would use this to talk/continue a conversation with your daughter about social media. At 8 my children know that everything online is public and forever - there is really no such thing as privacy. \n\nThey understand what they can and can\u2019t do when playing games online and know they will not be allowed to have social media for the foreseeable future. They know their friends have different rules and that\u2019s okay because every family is different. \n\nI don\u2019t judge a family for being okay with social media. I do judge someone for being confrontational and judgmental when hearing different boundaries. The reaction from these parents isn\u2019t healthy - there are multiple ways to maintain live social media and respect the privacy of others.\n\nYour rules are reasonable. Your daughter will understand them better if she\u2019s part of the conversation.", "NTA. How someone can look after 4 young kids while posting live I\u2019ll never do.

If you don't want your child being posted online, that is completely reasonable and fair. It isn't a big ask of the other mom. You should get to make the choice about how much of your and your child's life is displayed online. You were telling the other mom your concerns and reasons, not calling her a bad mom. It may seem like a big deal now, but your child will forget about this eventually and you'll have fun on your trip later this summer.", "NTA\n\nIt is reasonable to not want your daughter involved with tictok live.", "NTA. Honestly wish more parents would consider their kids safety over their \u2018content\u2019 and \u2018likes\u2019. \n\nIf your local police department or schools host\u2019s information days like ours does suggest your \u2018parent group\u2019 attend one on cyber safety and social media safety. \n\nWe invited the local police to give a lecture at our after school daycare for the parents and holy moly did some of them pale and start deleting and protecting stuff. \n\nIt took the police man less than five minutes from borrowing a random parents phone to getting detailed info on one of the other parents they didn\u2019t even know, and all using only what was available to that parent on their phone. Eye Opening", "NTA. Absolutely NTA. no one should be posting pics and vids of your child without your consent. Let alone livestreaming their location and what they're doing to the world. Maybe tell your friends that the friend wanted to livestream your child's location in a highly recognizable place in real time and see what they have to say", "NTA\n\nSarah shouldn't decline your request of not posting your daughter on thier social media. You're a good mom to your kid. If they post tiktoks about thier family, it's thier family and thier choice but they can't expect other families to post thier life on social media. Wanting to be private is nothing wrong. And you're not over reacting. You have every right to decline the offer to theme park if she gets angry for not letting YOUR daughter to be in thier video. Stand with your words.", "Nta I have the same rule for my daughter after pictures of my niece and nephew were taken from my mother's page and found on a predators Facebook page. You have to protect your child first and foremost.", "NTA. Some people trust social media and some don't, I won't call either side wrong but your child your choice.", "I have a no-show rule for my child when it comes to the internet as well. Predators are rampant and people do not take that as seriously as they should. The fact they couldn\u2019t respect your request is a bit alarming. It really isn\u2019t hard to just not show a kids face. Based on their lack of respect alone, I say NTA. Your daughter will thank you in the future for protecting her. But make sure to keep your promise, that you\u2019ll make the trip up to her.", "NTA the other mom flipped because she probably knows that focusing on social media rather than her own kids is stupid.", "So she has 3 kids plus one random kid and the point of the trip is live streaming? Yeah no I wouldn\u2019t want my 8 year old practically on her own so far away from me. NTA, it\u2019s not only about putting your daughter on the internet, it\u2019s having little supervision in the moment.", "NTA\n\nYou being protective over your kids is entirely up to you and good on you for it. \n\nI will say maybe talk to Evie about going to the theme park as a family another time?", "NTA.\nI wouldn't be so hung up if my kid was in the background of someone else's pics, as long as they're not named or tagged in them. But that's just me.\nYou gotta do what is best for your family. Evie will eventually get over it and will have her day of fun some other time.", "NTA. Not posting your kids online is a reasonable request. It's annoying when people think they need to put everything on social media anyway. I may have still let my daughter go, if I trusted the other parents outside of the social media thing, but that's just me.", "I just realized that with deepfake now every degenerate can get a pic of a kid and... please keep doing good mom, NTA and I wish more moms were like you nowadays.", "NTA. The thing is that if more parents were careful then kids wouldn\u2019t be as exploited and in as much danger as they are. It\u2019s a dangerous world out there. You take take of your kids the way you want to", "NTA - you are smart not to want your kids and yours and their entire lives paraded online. And anyone who says differently is an idiot.", "Absolutely NTA. It's up to each parent and family to decide their own boundaries for social media and the internet. If the mom is refusing to respect your family's boundaries, then you are absolutely right to not let your daughter go. I love the compromise of taking your daughter and a friend of her choice later this summer. \n\nAs a fellow mom who doesn't use social media, know that you are not alone. You are doing what you feel is best and safest for your daughter, and that's what matters. Sucks that the other mom can't respect your choices, but that's her problem.", "NTA, just talk to her about it. She's young, but kids pick up on a lot more than you think.  If you don't explain it to her she'll just come up with stupid kid excuses to be mad at you about.  Explain it, and then ask for her feedback on a trip you can plan with her and her friend.  You were gonna pay for this one, why  not do one you KNOW she would love through and through? Make it bigger, better, and... no pictures.", "NTA. It's not a huge ask to request your kid not be put on social media. Not taking videos for one afternoon is not a hardship. It sounds like she is actually being the difficult one.", "NTA It's rich that they call YOU a bad mom. You tried to compromise, but ultimately it is your decision whether Evie's pics are online. She is very lucky to have you as a mom, even if she doesn't appreciate it yet.", "NTA. There's a slim possibility you could have been TA to Sarah depending on how exactly you expressed your reasoning to her, but I really doubt it. And you're not at all TA to your daughter. Keeping her safe is more important than letting her go on this specific trip. If she wanted to go on a bike ride with Sarah's family, but you know none of them wear bike helmets and they wouldn't provide one for Evie, would you let her go? This is a safety issue just like that would be, and you made the call that is in line with how you want to protect and raise your kid.", "NTA if that\u2019s your parenting style! And you\u2019re making it up to Evie", "NTA, it\u2019s your kids. You have a very valid reason to not want your kids posted online. Years down the road your daughter will understand your reasons and it\u2019s just a day to the theme park which you\u2019re going to be making up for. It always feels like a bigger dramatic thing in the moment for kids but they\u2019ll soon get over it.", "NTA. And nothing here makes you sound like a bad mom. I wonder if Sarah feels like she might be a bad mom for taking her kids for what should be a fun day out and using them for social media clout?", "NTA. I don't even post about my own child (who is a teenager now) without his consent, and my FB is friends only-and I only friend people I know IRL or have spent years developing relationships with online. \n\nAlso what if you were in a situation where your child's safety could be compromised if her photo was seen online? \n\nPeople like to say you have no reasonable expectation of privacy in public but this obsession with social media and exploiting kids for views and followers over the last 10-15 years has been wild. \n\nI'm so glad I grew up before any and every single thing I ever did could be posted publicly for millions of people to have access to. \ud83d\ude05 Teenage me would have been in. hell.", "NTA, you\u2019re doing the best thing for your child by not having her face and location blasted live. Tell Sarah to check her analytics and see which group her videos are the most popular with, because I guarantee it\u2019s not who she thinks it is.", "NTA. Your kid, your rules.", "NTA, great parenting, she might not understand your reasoning now  but if she remembers this event in 10 years or so she'll probably understand it then. Sarah needs to understand that it's your child so you get to make those sort of decisions.\n\nAnd side note: she's gonna be doing lives all day? I don't know this woman she could be a great mom, could be a terrible mom, but either way, if I was her kid I'd prefer a mom that's present and hanging out with me while at the theme park.", "You are absolutely NTA and I would have decided the same as you. You tried to find a compromise and there was none to be had, and that\u2019s not on you. She _will_ understand when she\u2019s older, it just feels hard for her now. Just remember that it\u2019s ok for you to hold the boundary and it\u2019s ok for her to be upset about it \u2764\ufe0f", "Totally NTA. Not even a little bit. Posting your own kids on public social media accounts is gross enough and someone else's kids? You're a good parent and your daughter might not appreciate it now but she will when she's older.", "NTA for protecting your daughter from a family who wants to exploit their children and yours for attention on the internet. Not to mention the risks of predators online, say your daughter does something on the livestream that she\u2019ll be embarrassed by when she\u2019s an adult, like if her and her friend have a fight. She\u2019s only 8. These videos will exist on the internet for the rest of her life.", "NTA. Evie is *your* child. *You* are her parents. Both sides have valid points, but what it comes down to is that this is your child and therefore *you* get to decide if you are comfortable with the SM exposure.\n\nGood for you for planning an alternative trip to the same destination in an environment that you are more comfortable with.", "NTA \n\nThey are probably going to announce the trip on social media which will allow others to know their location. I would be afraid that some of their followers would go to the park. That\u2019s just too much to worry about as a parent. \n\nI think you made the right choice. Explain to your daughter the reasoning behind it and make it as honest as you can about the dangers of the social media family posting everything. This may help her understand that you\u2019re keeping her safe from potential predators. It may be a good time to have a talk about internet safety.", "You are free to make this decision for your child.  \nI grew up with a very protective mother. I moved thousands of miles away, speak to here weekly, and never ask for her advice on my life. \nDecisions are not made in a vacuum.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole but i do think you\u2019re being extreme and maybe overly cautious. \nI think by you saying that to her made her feel like you turn your nose up to kids online and her kids are online. I don\u2019t like the world knowing about my daughter and life either. But I\u2019d have made an exception with gratitude for an offer like that Evie got. I also think you and the other child\u2019s mom could\u2019ve or maybe still could have a very good and beneficial friendship after this. She can help you with some of your fears and you and Evie will have lifelong friends. \n\nAs this group calls it I\u2019d say \u201cYTA\u201d but I don\u2019t really think you\u2019re an asshole just overly cautious and protective. N I think if not now, then in time you\u2019ll learn to ease up a little with maybe just this trusted family.", "NTA. While I personally wouldn't care and would let my child go I don't think  you are wrong for not wanting your child to go since you aren't comfortable with it. \n If it were just posting pictures, and you trusted they would only post pictures, I would say let her go IF the host parents promised to edit the pic by blurring or covering her face.and again if you fully trusted rhe parents to keep their word.", "YTA. Parents obsession with keeping their kids images off the internet is bizarre and unrealistic. You want to try that with a baby, okay that's a decision. You want to prevent your 8yo from going to public places because of some internet boogie monster? Great way to start building resentment from your kid at an early age. Just to be clear, your kids image and personal information is on the internet. That's just a reality. You are far better teaching her safe habits rather than expecting total isolation from it. \n\nSay it with me, Abstinence only education does not work.", "NTA only because its a live broadcast. Because a few pictures would definitely not hurt. Your daughter might be in the background of 100 pictures out there and likely has school pictures too so your reasoning is not very good.", "NTA. Just because I allow my kid to be on social media ( granted mine are teens) doesn't mean all their friends are. I will always follow a parent's wishes for their kid as long as they aren't abusive and keeping their kid off social media is not abusive.", "NAH\n\nEveryone has different preferences and that\u2019s fine. \n\nEvie is going to be fine, yeah it sucks hard to miss out on fun with friends, but it is what it is.

Like seriously let your child have fun with her friend", "YTA. You knew about the family and their social media activities.  Should have told your daughter and the mother from jump that she wasn't going. Just refused. You clearly disapprove of how they live their life and are raising their family. You being protective of your kids is commendable, but attempting to impose your parenting style makes you the ah.\n\nThe post shouldn't be about not letting her go, but why you felt comfortable telling another parent you should do or don't do this when it is clearly how they live their lives.", "You are not bad mom and neither is she. Every one posts or not posts on social media for their own reason. Others see it was \"There's nothing wrong\" and other's see it as a risk. My self, I'm somewhere in the middle. \n\nEither way, you are NTA for wanting privacy for your kids and Sarah should respect your choice.", "YTA. You should have let her go.

They are only kids for a few years, then teens for a few years, and then they are adults who need to be able to make choices and plans all by themselves. Why not let them in on the process?\n\nYes, sometimes they are going to be upset, but learning to deal with this is part of becoming an adult. Kids need to learn to cope with being dissapointed and they need to know that plans fall through much more than we'd like. Things like this situation are a very low stakes way of practising for adulthood. Making all their choices for them, without them, then offering them the opportunity you've already arranged is blinding them to the reality of making plans.

Without letting them see this side of life, you get adults who don't know how to make these choices for themselves - or cope when things don't go their way.", "What do you mean divorce culture?", "Also GenX here, and I think it has more to recognizing that children are also people than 'divorce culture'.

Every sports season we see kids that are drafted lose their future because of ignorant stuff they posted in high school.

And their small viewpoints can seriously hinder their success in the future if they\u2019re typing about prejudices and biases due to their naivety. That excuse doesn\u2019t work to protect them from themselves. It\u2019s something that parents don\u2019t address correctly in general.

Parents' social media posts can affect their kids' ability to get a job in the future if they're not careful about what they post...and parents who overshare are not being careful. It's also very self-centered to post stuff about your kids just to get \"likes\" and attention without considering how your posts will affect your kids in the future.
