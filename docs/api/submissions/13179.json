He admitted to me that he wasn't good at budgeting and finances. He never knew what a 401K was and has never taken advantage of his company match. We agreed to combine finances and I would take the lead on it. I like to budget and know a little more about investing/retirement. We still talk about all financial decisions.   \n\n\nWell recently, he went to a bachelor party with his best friends to Vegas. I gave him a budget of 2k. In the middle of the trip, he called me to say that his budget wasn't enough. So I told him I would be able to pick up an extra shift at work so he can add another 500 to his budget. I didn't hear anything else about it afterward. \n\nWhen he came back from the trip, he said that all his friends made fun of him because he had to ask his wife. And that all his friends have separate finances from their partners because it's their money and they should be able to do whatever they want with it. His friend encouraged him to have separate finances as well because most couples argue about money. We had never argued about money in the past, we always talked through everything.\n\nI was upset at first but agreed. I said I would take care of the mortgage and daycare and he would be responsible for groceries and utilities. We live in an HCOL so our mortgage and daycare are like 7k/month. (if it matters I make 200k and he makes 120k) I told him that I will not take on his debt if he wanted separate finances. (We had gotten it down to 120k at this point). He was shocked and said I was being unreasonable. \n\nI said that we can keep our finances combined and have open conversations that I felt was working for us. We can split the debt. But if we are going to have separate finances I don't want to be responsible for his debt because I don't know if he's going to add to that debt.

He probably didn\u2019t also tell them that you volunteered to take on an extra shift so he could spend more money on this trip. Your husband can\u2019t have his cake and eat it.

Now it seems, he thought he could separate the finances, ie. regain control of his paycheck while you pay down his debt and he gets fun money.", "NTA. He can't have both the freedom to spend his money the way he wants and freedom from the consequences of spending his money unwisely.

He should be learning how to manage his own money any way. You doing it for him teaches him nothing.", "NTA for not wanting to be at his financial mercy, so to speak, but there is a middle ground - combined finances for all regular expenses plus allowances for everyone to do with as you please, and if he wants to do something big (like a trip), he has to save for it. That way he does not have to ask you, and it is his responsibility to have enough money to do the things he wants to do. It's probably possible to set it up in a way that he cannot run up more debt.", "NTA.  I\u2019m agog at him thinking that you will agree to separate finances AND assume, at least to some extent, his debts.  It\u2019s time for him to put on his big boy pants.

OPs husband spent more in a weekend at Vegas than I did repairing three whole rooms.", "That\u2019s a whole entire second-hand French Horn or a Yamaha Xeno trumpet!!!", "Ummm is this a repost? Because I remember reading this post pretty much word for word months ago?", "NTA. Your husband is bonkers for thinking you\u2019d pay off his enormous debt at all honestly (lucky him that you have been) and for him to expect you to still do that while ever other part of finances is separate is even more insane and insulting. Tell him his friends marriages and opinions don\u2019t matter in your marriage decisions and conversations. That your financial deal was working out great for everyone before, he had his debt almost halved, so why fix what isn\u2019t broken just because his friends made him feel insecure?", "NTA There\u2019s a lot to unpack here but you gave him $2000 to go to Vegas, a notorious cheating place, for a bachelor party, and then when he asked for more money you said YOU\u2019D pick up an extra shift so he could have an extra $500?  To me that says you\u2019re going way too far in trying to compromise.  Please take care of your needs and finances because your husband clearly isn\u2019t going to take care of them.", "NTA\n\nYou need to have b mix of separate and shared finances.\n\n1 account for living expenses.  Bills, groceries, insurances..etc.\n\n1 account for savings/investments/holidays\n\n1 account each for whatever the heck you want", "NTA. He wants to have his cake and eat it too. \n\nAlso, as a frequent Vegas visitor who loves to gamble and live it up- that is a LOT to spend on a short trip!! He wants to live like he doesn\u2019t have that debt. He needs to face facts.", "NTA. He wants to separate your finances, that\u2019s fine. But why does HIS debt fall under the category of YOUR finances? Ask him to explain that to you before you agree and see what he says", "NTA: did your husband also tell his friends you helped pay off 80k of his debt? Sounds like he is feeling insecure and not \"Man enough\". Nip this little cry baby behavior in the bud. Tell him to tell off his friends for their disrespectful comments on your marriage and your finance. Also, give him this killer of a line: I am sorry you and your wives don't communicate and trust each other well enough to have shared finances. But we talk about every large expenditure and agree on a shared amount. MY WIFE worked an EXTRA SHIFT so that I could have more money at a BACHELOR PARTY - a party designed to DISRESPECT MARRIAGE AND TEMPT INFIDELITY. So yeah. I discussed adding half a thousand extra dollars to the bill.", "NTA.\n\nPersonally I'd be considering setting the whole husband aside, but at least give him his debt back, split expenses proportionally to income, agree to an amount for savings and 'spending money'. \n\nRight now you are subsidising his ass.", "NTA. He wants to have his cake and eat it too. You are being extremely reasonable. He doesn\u2019t want to compromise.", "NTA, he wants to do what he wants to do with his money but have you pay his massive amount of debt?!?!? What world is he living in and who are these \u201cfriends\u201d. Split finances usually cause more of an issue. It gets to the point that I paid for this so you need to pay for that. Then it\u2019s not fair because you make more money than me. Then it becomes why should I cover your debt when it\u2019s your debt. Do what you want but I would talk to a lawyer about making sure you don\u2019t get tied to his debt. His past actions show once his finances are separate he will add to his debt.", "NTA, but more importantly, why are his friends all up in your financial business? What is he, a child?", "NTA. He and his friends (whom will never cover any of his debt) conveniently skip over that when a couple decides on separate finances that also means they are responsible for their own debt. Only joint debt such a the house or cars when in both their names are they responsible together to pay for.  School loans, credit cards and other debt incurred before the marriage is that person's alone to pay off.", "You are being more than reasonable. Just be ready to pick up the rest of the bills. NTA. \n\nI\u2019m just wondering why he is letting his friends direct his life? Can he not make decisions himself? No wonder he is in debt. You were much nicer than I would have been. His debt, his problem. He is wanting to play with his money. He really doesn\u2019t sound mature enough for a partnership, more like a frat boy.", "I make a lot more than OPs husband and have 0 debt and I still would be embarrassed to tell my wife about losing $2500 over a weekend in vegas. What a colossal waste", "My sister does close to this (note the op said make an extra 500 not hourly) she is a nurse practitioner at an urgent care and gets paid based on what happens in her shift. How many patients she saw and what procedures she did. There is a base salary I believe but if she worked an extra shift she could cheerfully add an extra 500.", "The way I see it debts are part of your finances.  By combining your finances you also combined your debts.\n\nBut if you separate your finances again, you also separate your debts.\n\nIt sounds like he wants the benefits of combined finances, (in other words, you paying off his debt.) but not any of the actual responsibility.\n\nHe just doesn't want his friends to think he's \"less of a man\" because you have a say in what he spends.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: a word", "Do it! It helps relieve so much stress off of the more financially responsible one", "I keep seeing this. You think every doctor makes more than that? Reminds me of the guy who thought \"every lawyer in the UK makes more than me, a guy making \u00a390k\"", "What are the 3 Fs?\n\nFAFO only has 2, and when I tried googling it, all I get are the technical specifications for a meat grinder... which, to be fair, sounds applicable for OP's husband and his rowdy friends, but I'm guessing there's something else I'm missing.", "Fuck your Fuckwit Friends? \ud83d\ude05", "That's a Warlord Titan with all its weapons!"]}
