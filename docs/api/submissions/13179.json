When we decided we were serious, we decided to talk about our finances. He revealed that he had 200k in debt (a mix of loans and CC) and I have no debt. He admitted to me that he wasn't good at budgeting and finances. He never knew what a 401K was and has never taken advantage of his company match. We agreed to combine finances and I would take the lead on it. I like to budget and know a little more about investing/retirement. We still talk about all financial decisions.   \n\n\nWell recently, he went to a bachelor party with his best friends to Vegas. I gave him a budget of 2k. In the middle of the trip, he called me to say that his budget wasn't enough. So I told him I would be able to pick up an extra shift at work so he can add another 500 to his budget. I didn't hear anything else about it afterward. \n\nWhen he came back from the trip, he said that all his friends made fun of him because he had to ask his wife. And that all his friends have separate finances from their partners because it's their money and they should be able to do whatever they want with it. His friend encouraged him to have separate finances as well because most couples argue about money. We had never argued about money in the past, we always talked through everything.\n\nI was upset at first but agreed. I said I would take care of the mortgage and daycare and he would be responsible for groceries and utilities. We live in an HCOL so our mortgage and daycare are like 7k/month. (if it matters I make 200k and he makes 120k) I told him that I will not take on his debt if he wanted separate finances. (We had gotten it down to 120k at this point). He was shocked and said I was being unreasonable. \n\nI said that we can keep our finances combined and have open conversations that I felt was working for us. We can split the debt. But if we are going to have separate finances I don't want to be responsible for his debt because I don't know if he's going to add to that debt. And I'm taking on a bigger portion of his living cost so that he can focus more on his debt. But now his friends are calling me A\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*. I think I'm being pretty reasonable.

Good luck OP!", "NTA\nIf he wants separate finances that\u2019s fine. That includes separate debt that was his alone to begin with.", "NTA. Your husband is being ridiculous. You\u2019re literally helping him and he\u2019s accusing you of emasculating him. I guarantee when his friends were teasing him and giving him \u201cadvice\u201d, they had no idea that your husband brought $200k into your marriage and you\u2019re trying to help him pay off his debt and develop better financial management skills. He probably didn\u2019t also tell them that you volunteered to take on an extra shift so he could spend more money on this trip. Your husband can\u2019t have his cake and eat it. He can\u2019t ask to make his financial decision on his own while also expecting you to help pay his debt.", "NTA\n\nSeparate finances are separate finances, he should\u2019ve thought about the repercussions before deciding he needed to be as cool as his friends.", "NTA\n\nYou **are** being reasonable. \n\nHis actions have consequences and he was willing to let you share those consequences.  Now it seems, he thought he could separate the finances, ie. regain control of his paycheck while you pay down his debt and he gets fun money.", "NTA. He can't have both the freedom to spend his money the way he wants and freedom from the consequences of spending his money unwisely. It sounds like his friends are telling him to be a \"real man\" and of course the definition of a \"real man\" is to do exactly what your friends tell you to do.", "NTA your husband got made fun of and he's butt hurt. Bet he didn't tell his buddies he's on a budget to pay back all his own debt.", "NTA. Sounds like he\u2019s got here a case of FAFO. He got himself into his mess.

If he wants to separate finances, then him dealing with his debt is more than fair.", "NTA he really didn't think things through.\n\nIf you do split finances Instead of one person being responsible for some bills, and the other for other bills.\n\nMight make a lot more sense to still pay all bills from a joint pot.  So your sure the bills get paid and he contribute s fairly.", "NTA that seems very reasonable.", "NTA - He can either take on his own debt or combine finances and accept that you both should be involved and make decisions together. His friends encouraging him to separate his finances but still want you to pay his bill, that you had nothing to do with, are AHs. They have absolutely no stake in this and are just stirring up trouble for no reason other than amusement at the drama it\u2019s causing you two. These are horrible friends and they need to mind their own business.", "NTA - he should stop listening to his friends and get a financial advisor.", "NTA - but you may want to try a different approach. Each of you has your own bank account to do with as you please. Then decide on a percentage of your salary to go into a joint account that pays for the expenses and to pay down debt. That way, he has his own money and have joint funds to pay the bills and his debt.", "NTA. Stick to your guns. He should be happy and confident that he has someone to help him manage his finances and who is willing to take on his debt period. \n\nHis friends are immature and will likely never have what you can help you and your husband to build financially due to poor choices. \n\nBut aye if he wants to learn the hard way then let him separate them and fall on his ass. He should be learning how to manage his own money any way. You doing it for him teaches him nothing.", "NTA for not wanting to be at his financial mercy, so to speak, but there is a middle ground - combined finances for all regular expenses plus allowances for everyone to do with as you please, and if he wants to do something big (like a trip), he has to save for it. That way he does not have to ask you, and it is his responsibility to have enough money to do the things he wants to do. It's probably possible to set it up in a way that he cannot run up more debt.", "NTA.  I\u2019m agog at him thinking that you will agree to separate finances AND assume, at least to some extent, his debts.  It\u2019s time for him to put on his big boy pants.  If you don\u2019t have a prenup agreement, it may be time to explore a post nuptial agreement.", "NTA. He is very weak willing and susceptible to influence. Kinda an ick.", "NTA.

He pays all his bills and I pay mine and we pay household expenses out of the household account.     The good part about that is he's on his own for personal expenses.
