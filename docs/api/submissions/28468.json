We started dating and after a year she accidentally got pregnant. I felt I was too young to be a father but decided that, if she wanted to keep the baby, I would have taken care of them. She changed her mind a dozen times but in the end she decided to keep the child. So I did what I had to do: our families weren't rich so I left college, found a job and started preparing for the child. \n\nMy son, Leo, was born in June. I worked impossible hours, spent whatever was left of my time taking care of Leo and my mother spent a lot of time at our apartment to help taking care of Leo. Linda's parents did basically nothing. They told me in my face that I was not welcome in their home and they spent a total of 2 hours with Leo in the months following his birth.\n\nWhen Leo was 7 months old, Linda bailed on us. One day she called my father to come help taking care of Leo, he went to our apartment and she wasn't there: Leo was sleeping in his crib and Linda's belongings were gone together with the money left in the house. I tried contacting her and going to her parent's home but they weren't there and she never answered the phone.\n\nIt's been 11 years since then. Now it's just me, Leo and my father. My mother unfortunately passed away last year. Despite all the problems we had Leo has grown up to be an amazing, cheerful and smart kid. He is my pride and joy and I will do anything to protect him and make him happy. He doesn't remember his mother \n\nFew weeks ago Linda showed up at my door in the middle of the day. She asked to talk and I reluctantly agreed. \n\nTo sum it up what she said: she is sorry for what she did and wants to be part of Leo's life again. I told her NO. She begged and then said some unkind thing about me as a person when I refused again.  I told her I do not care what she think. Until Leo is old enough to make a choice, she will not see him. After he is old enough, I will tell him the truth and he will decide on his own accord what he wants to do.\n\nSince, unfortunately, we live in a small town where rumors spread rapidly, I'm now being judged by some neighbors for my reaction. I don't think I am in the wrong here and my family agree with me but I guess another opinion would be welcomed since I'm basically going crazy.

Make sure the court knows she left a 7 month old ALONE. \n\nAlso, find a family therapist, maybe one outside of your little town who isn\u2019t already biased by hearing about it and talk to them yourself. Set up a time and place to quickly tell Leo what\u2019s happening. Not every sordid detail but in a small town he\u2019s going to hear it and it\u2019s best he gets the strait info from you.

I may also want to see her getting some kind of therapy if that was what it took to make me feel that she wouldn't abandon him again.  I do have to admit that her anger response is a bit troubling - the degree of which depends on exactly what \"unkind\" things she said.\n\nAt that point I would feel my son out to find out where his mind is at on that - likely without letting him know yet that she was back.\n\nBased on all of that, I would make my decision.  Ideally, it is best for kids to know and love both parents - but I would definitely want to be sure that she wouldn't hurt him again so would proceed with caution but, if at all possible, I would allow the relationship to develop.  11 years is a long time, and people can do a lot of growing in that time.\n\nOne other thing to consider... you may have no choice but to discuss the matter with your son.  With this being a small town and the people having strong opinions, someone somewhere will very likely tell him what's going on... and it is far better to come from you.  Also - not sure of the laws where you are, but if she takes you to court for visitation, you may then lose the control over when/where/how often she sees him.", "She can see your son when she comes up with 11 years of child support payments and a written apology for child abandonment and theft \n\nNTA - you\u2019re protecting your son - she gave up the rights to be involved in his life the moment she left him alone and ran off", "NTA that chick is an awful human being.

He reappeared when the child was 10 yo, saying the same things Linda said. I said his guilt was his own to work out but I was not introducing him into my child\u2019s life after 10 years of abandonment. \nIn my case my spouse had adopted the child (the biological father could not sign away his rights quickly enough) so legally he had no standing. \nWhen my child was 15 they wanted to meet biological dad, and I arranged it. It didn\u2019t work out well and now, almost 10 years later, they are estranged again. \n\nOP, your son is too young to meet this person, imho. I hope you have had discussions with him as to why his mother has not been in his life until now, and if you haven\u2019t do it asap. But he does not need this chaos in his life simply because after 11 years she had a change of heart. \nBased on my experience if your son wants to meet her at some point, you should facilitate that, but only because *your son* wants it, not because Linda is pushing for it. \nAnd if he doesn\u2019t have one already, I recommend your son work with a therapist to help him navigate the feelings he has over his mother\u2019s abandonment, and to help sort through the meeting with the mother, should there ever be one.", "NTA you have sole custody of your minor child (who is 11, which can still be pretty immature and vulnerable).

Those should be the conditions to even discuss it. If she does that then say you will entertain supervised visits on the condition he wants to see her. Ultimately there's a good chance the court would err on the side of caution and allow that anyway.\n\nI would also tell your son that his mother abandoned you both, and stole from you, and that she hasn't once asked about him in the intervening time.

There\u2019s zero doubt that the mom screwed up horrifically, but the kid has questionable even if he\u2019s not asking.

I don't know how you think you're going to successfully keep this info from your son but if your neighbors are gossiping their kids have heard it to.

Unless you don't even allow your 11 year old to ride their bike to a friend's house, she can get to him. \n\nThe second this happens, you've lost control of the narrative because as far as your son can tell, you deliberately lied to him. This can drive him into his deadbeat mom's arms and lead to exactly the scenario you're so afraid of (he latches onto her and then she leaves).\n\nSet all the rules about contact that you want, but if you choose not to tell him, you are playing with fire and setting yourself up for exactly what you're trying to avoid.

She made the selfish decision to keep the child because it was ultimately HER choice, then abandoned him and forced you to be a single father with no help from her or her parents and no childsupport(something she undoubtedly would have gotten from you if the roles were reversed) because she decided to do what was best for HER and leave you to pick up the pieces. Everything she did was selfish to the nth degree and so is this. She is showing back up because SHE has desires and regrets, despite the damage that her re-entry could do to you and that boy. Again she is thinking of only herself and what she wants. Protect yourself and protect your son. If she regrets her choice and wants to be a mother now, she can go start over with someone else and try not to f*ck it up this time.

We also appreciate the stability you and your family have provided your son in her absence. BUT, all children want to know their mothers/fathers. It is part of understanding yourself and how you shape your own sense of value and identity. \n\nLeo may not care much what his mom has done wrong. It's likely more important for him to meet her and establish a relationship that meets his needs on his terms.

Don't let your personal feelings interfere and become an obstacle in the relation between your son and his mother. Don't use your child to try to punish her. This will bring no good to nobody, on the contrary. Your son was deprived from his mother for 11 years, I don't think you help him by depriving him further from any contact with her. The fact that his mother was/is not a \"good\" mother is irrelevant, as long as she is not positively harming him in the future.

In general, it is always better for a child to have contact to both parents, only if they harm their child should they be forbidden to see their child. Your ex does not have a good track record of being a good mother, but a lot of things can change in ten years. You owe it to your son to at least give your ex a chance to prove to yourself that she has changed and if she does that, to introduce her to your son and support him if he wants to build a relationship with her. A good start would be to establish financial responsibility if she does not pay child support yet and probe about her motivation to come back now (usually there is an event not too far in the past that tipped the scale). Then maybe introduce some supervised visitation if you decide that she is trustworthy.\n\nI do respect what you are doing for your son as a single father and commend you for your strength, but if you decide not to hear your ex out and give her a chance to prove to you that she has changed, you'll mainly hurt your son by doing so.

Sounds like you are a great parent and Leo is lucky to have you - keeping taking care of him and protecting him, even from his egg donor, if necessary.", "Your small town gossips should be reminded that Linda abandoned her infant and disappeared for 10 years.\n\nConsult a lawyer. I am pretty sure her conduct is sufficient to support legal termination of parental rights. Also find out whether her parents could assert grandparent rights.\n\nIf lawyers are not in your budget, check with som law schools. Many have supervised law clinics which handle family law things like this.", "NTA!!  F Linda and your neighbors who think they have a say in any of this.\n. \nYou showed up every.single.day and 11 years later she wants a relationship??  Too damn bad!\n\nDepending on your state/country, your fab son may be able to make a choice to at 13, but until then, absolutely NOT.\n\nThanks for being a Great Dad.  The world needs more ppl like you.  Single parenting is really hard, but so important.\nBest wishes.", "An 11 year old is old enough to decide whether he wants a relationship with his mother.", "I'd mention to Leo that his birth mother was back in town just so that he's super extra cautious in case she tries to approach him when he's playing or just out of the house without you. She will have no legal standing to enforce visitation because then you simply press charges for child endangerment when she left him home alone as an infant. \n\nI'm sure Leo has had some curiosity about her even if he hasn't said that to you. At 11 he's old enough to understand that mother wasn't a mom or mommy, she was literally just the person who gave birth to him. Explain your reluctance to him, and why, then ask if he wants to know anything about her and if he'd like to meet her in a few years. You're definitely NTA but mother is absolutely TA alongside being reckless, stupid and realistically a criminal for leaving such a young child unsupervised. Explain that her parents know of him but thus far haven't wanted to pursue a relationship with him. Please don't use the words that they 'don't want' him as that will be very damaging. For him. Explain that you weren't forced to stay, you're his dad because you love him to the very core of your soul and couldn't comprehend not being his dad.", "NTA. Protect your son.", "NTA", "NTA: She wasn't there for the tough times and wants to coast in as a cool mom now that the kid can take care of themselves more or less. Fuck her, fuck her family and fuck the town. GO DAD.", "I can give you some advice since I have been in Leo's shoes kinda. The only thing is my father never tried looking for me. But my mom told me when I was 7 or 8 what happened (how he left us) just in case he would come to school and try to change the story. I think you should tell him what happened so your ex cannot lie to him.", "NTA, honestly, I'd move.", "NTA. You are protecting your son and that is understandable. But i think you should talk to your son about the situation at some point, because of the small town rumors - he will hear about his mother from others and he might be mad at you for not telling him yourself. And as a 11 (or so) old he should be able to understand if you are honest with him.", "Absolutely not NTA", "NTA in any way, although your son may be old enough to start talking to him. If he gets to the teenage angst years and finds out his mom tried, he may get mad at all of you. She will certainly tell a tale to him.  It\u2019s not good, but sometimes you have to keep your enemies close.", "Nta but be careful here. Your son may end up holding this against you. I get you are angry at her and you have every right to be. That being said just remember we are all human and we all make really bad choices. If it was me I would at least allow her to see him and allow him to make that choice. You don't want him to grow up and blame you for not being able to see his mom. You gotta follow your heart here and do what you think is right. Just don't let your anger at her cloud you judgement on what's best for the boy.", "What have you told Leo so far about why he doesn't have a mom in his life? If the town gossips as much as you say, he WILL find out before you want him to, and you're better off breaking the news yourself than letting him find out and wonder why you kept it from him.", "I think this should be up to Leo. Get help from a child psychologist in talking things through with him. You think he's still too young and you actually know him so I won't say you're wrong. But there should be some sort of plan to talk to Leo about this so he can gradually get used to the idea and express his feeling safely. I'm not keen on keeping a parent away from a child indefinitely unless there is sexual abuse involved or other very serious abuse.\n\nNAH except maybe for your ex but I guess she had her reasons and she regrets it now", "Stand your ground homie! You sound like an excellent father and are doing the right thing. Good on you. So so so nta", "NTA!! Your responsibility is to protect your son. And if she loved him then she wouldn't be going about any of this the way she is. She has no right showing up all these years later causing drama in his life and town. It's not his fault she walked out and she needs to accept the consequences of her actions. He shouldn't suffer because of what she did.", "NTA - It is your son's choice when he is old enough. \n\nShe doesn't just get to leave and re-enter as she sees fit. What's to say she won't disappear again. \n\nYou are doing the right thing protecting your Son. \nYou're a good father. \n\nI would say open honesty with your son is the best choice. To obscure the truth, or sugar coat it is only going to cause damage for yours and your Son's relationship in the future, but also don't come across as the reason for their lack of relationship. Be honest without being the roadblock beyond sensible protection.", "NTA. Please keep her away, at least right now. The fact she showed up like that and guilted you, shows what kind of person she is right now. She\u2019s not thinking of your son, she doesn\u2019t care how this affects him. I would be questioning why she should up, especially like that. If she does press thru the courts, please request a slow building AND supervised relationship. Make sure you contact the schools, any extra circular activities, etc so she doesn\u2019t approach him or try and take him. If he doesn\u2019t have a phone, maybe think about one for safety reasons.", "NTA - but you reply that you lied to him about the mother by telling him it was a mutual decision. If he is cheerful and smart there is a high chance that some dramatic gossipers are going to make it into something far worse and you risk him getting pumped with wrong information that paints an entirely different story.   \n\n\nLike \"Your mom ran away because your dad was abusive to her and your dad told you a lie about it. Now your dad is preventing her seeing you because he is afraid you will find out the truth about him.\" or some other crap like that.  \n\n\nBut the story is lacking the reason why she left. This rarely happens just randomly.  \n\n\nIt would be a good idea to somehow talk with someone he also trusts and then talk with him about it.", "this is not a matter of aita. this is a matter of legal proceedings. she owes you a lot of money for the last 11 years.", "Well to me your not because she knew yal had a baby and she bailed but years later yu wanna come back I don\u2019t think so", "NTA, but how old would you consider your son to be before he can make that decision? Eleven is a little young, but by the time he is 12 or 13, I would say he is old enough to decide whether or when he wants to meet his mother.", "NTA, but I would go after her for child support, present and back pay. It\u2019s not about spite, she\u2019s been pocketing money she owes your son. Time for her to pay up.", "NTA \n\nAmazing how they're all okay with her bailing for 11years they're all a bunch of hypocrites and don't deserve anymore of your energy.\n\nOn the other hand its a small town and gossips already getting back to you. Not long now to it trickles down to the kids int the town and Leo gets some twisted rumor version of the tale.\n\nIt's time for family therapy. Individual for both of you and then obviously sessions together. 11 is young but not so young that in the right environment and right words that he can't understand what's going on.  But he needs to learn the truth from you. Rather than some twisted version from the streets. \n\nEspecially since the rumor mill seems against you at this point. \n\nAs an aside I'm a vindictive and petty person I would 100% get some friends family and associates to start getting the rumor mill on myside in this if i was in your position. Cause the spin doctoring right now is absolutely filthy between her and her parents they all deserve to not have a moments peace.", "let her go to court to get visitation and pay you all the back child support.", "NTA\n\nCondolences for your loss, OP, and good on you for stepping up for the little guy. My sperm donor ditched while I was still baking, so it was always just me and my ma. I had questions early on. \"Daddy Day\" in kindergarten was tough, but Mom didn't keep the truth from me when I asked. I'm glad she did that, even though it did hurt. \n\nI say tell your son the truth, in 11yo terms, of course. It will hurt, even if he doesn't show it, but it sounds like he's got a good dad and grandpa to help him through it.", "NTA but still think you should consider letting Leo meet his mother. Why? because you don't know her state of mind when she left. She obviously never bonded with Leo, and this happens because of Post Partum Depression and extreme stress. She may have been on the edge of suicide. I went through a minor version of this with my first child. My second was a completely different experience. \n\nShe has probably been wracked with guilt ever since but now she feels she can form a relationship. This may be good for Leo. You can set the limits of how much she's involved. \n\nFrankly many, many fathers bail out, but mothers seem to be the ones who are condemned the most. At least ask her what was going through her mind at the time.", "I agree with your decision. She left for 11 years to continue with her life. fuck her guilt fuck all that she shouldn't have made that choice", "Nta. You did exactly the right thing.", "When you said \u201cborn in June,\u201d I thought the baby was 4 months old?", "NTA\n\nwho gives a shit what your neighbors think?  Did they care when this asshat was gone for 11 years?\n\nGet a lawyer though.", "Definitely NTA. But you can't protect him from hearing her side of it so tell him the truth now. All of it. Show him the Court papers. Tell him how her parents treated both of you. What she and they did WAS NOT a mistake or a bad decision that took eleven years for her to figure out. She didn't care and left, her parents didn't care either. There is no excuse here. Small towns are the worst.", "Maybe he wants to meet his mother", "NTA, but you should let Leo decide. An 11 year old is old enough to know if they want to meet thier mom or not.\n\nYour ex has no right to him, but your son does have a right to know his mom.", "My situation is not quite the same, my parents divorced when I was 1, and I lived with my mother, seeing my dad a few times a year. My mother got to control the narrative as it were, and my dad never said anything bad about her my entire childhood, his time was about me, not her. A few times he thought I was asleep or couldn't hear him and he'd talk to his brother (my uncle) or other family members, and it broke my heart to hear. Never anything bad, even when he thought I couldn't hear. As I got older, I started to piece more things together, and he would share more info with me or my wife, and it reaffirmed things I had already suspected about my mom and step dad, but never told him or anyone about. He didn't know my thoughts, and quite frankly wasn't around me enough to know I'd started piecing things together and painting a picture of what had happened to cause them to split as well as my life with her and my step dad. The man has his faults, but to this day he doesn't know how much I respect him for never badmouthing my mom, even if he deserves to (and he does deserve it, in case anyone was wondering).\n\nI started putting things together when I was about your son's age.\n\nYou're NTA, OP, but your son is old enough to start formulating his own stories, ideas, etc and asking questions. He's old enough to be told what happened, and as others have said, people will tell him if you don't. You do not want that to happen, trust me. I've had plenty of experience with people telling me things about one or the other of my parents and it's not fun, at any age. But, you need to talk to him, let him know what happened, then and now. It will be tough, but my guess is it will probably be harder on you than him -- he already knows she's not around, he can see *something* happened, but he was way too young to remember. He may have some questions so be prepared to answer them truthfully, and try to do it as informational as possible, with as little malice and hate as you can. Be as calm, cool, and collected as you can; it's ok to show emotion, show him how much she hurt you, and by extension him. Let him know that you're not ok with her being in your family's life and why; again let him see the hurt and the fear of what might again happen.\n\nBut you need to talk to him, or others will. And that's where the real trouble will begin. He's old enough, and he'll probably surprise you with his reaction. Take it from someone who has heard the whispers or outright \"shouting from the mountain tops\", he doesn't want or need that before you talk to him, and neither do you.", "You do you and take car did your boy. He will be old enough to decide at some point but you should have the discussion with him as soon as possible without bias so he can make his own decision. I\u2019m also not sure if you might face some resentment from him if you wait too long to tell him.", "I agree with you. I agree in being cautious too. She left for *11* years. I wonder what inspired her to come back NOW. is she sick? Infertile? Getting married? Id dig deep into this one. Also I would definitely chat w a lawyer to protect yourself.\nEdit to add NTA \nAlso anyone that truly cares about your business should care more that she left your child unattended the day she left  and then for 11 yrs", "Iam gonna say NTA I don't have much context surrounding her visit but judging by the way she took the money out of the house when she left and her parents couldn't care less ide say that they are all selfish people  and although I think people can change she most likely wants to reconnect for selfish reasons she left you with your guys kid so she could do whatever she wanted to do instead of what's right  bottom line shes selfish and irresponsible so who knows what her motives are  When I was young for a good couple years before  My mom went to prison whenever I would visit with her she would use that time to create lies about me and my fathers living situation to get full custody of me and thank God she didn't she wasn't in a place to take care of a child", "NTA. She made the choice to bail and took the money of the household with her. She made no effort to contact you any sooner so now it's just a matter of convenience (and most likely a move to gain custody and child support from you). You do however need to speak to your son and let him decide how to proceed.", "They r judging u negatively cuz they know what happened on her side of the story. u r NTA at all. idc that leo came out if her, she bailed on yall for lil more than a decade and suddenly **now** she wants to just come back and act like nothing happened?! if i was u i would have done the same!", "When you consider the fact her relationship with her child was only months long, she hardly ever was \"a part of his life.\"", "NTA\n\nShe owes you 11 years of child support.", "\nNTA. \n\nYour ex GF is a horrible human being.  \n\nHer parents are horrible human beings. \n\nDo what you need to do to protect and raise Leo.", "Well that is something I would stay well away from without being asked for an opinion but since OP is asking: 11 is imo old enough to be involved in that decision. It is not unlikely the decision would be to see her so it is understandable you don't want there to be a choice since you don't want that outcome. But if you somehow keep it a secret in a small town what is the long term plan? Tell him in a few years his mother has wanted to see him for years but you thought he might want to see her if you told him? He might go \"you did this to protect me and I am grateful and happy about it\" or \"who cares I never knew her\", who knows. I just know my reaction would have been more negative even if I didn't particularly care about meeting her, I would consider it a betrayal of my trust. (Depends on what you consider old enough of course.)\n\nI am not someone who would appreciate others secretly making big decisions for me for my best and wouldn't have appreciated it at 11 either so that colors my perspective and ymmv. But I also agree with the people that say he is likely to find out in a small town and getting ahead gives you more control about how it plays out.", "NTA. However you need to get ahead of this before he hears it elsewhere and is blindsided.  I know you want to wait  but you don't want to end up being the bad guy in this situation.", "The fact that she said unkind things about you made me think not much has changed and she has no remorse and still puts herself first. Ask a child psychologist. But agree that Leo shouldn't be blindsided, he will hear the rumours.", "Unfortunately,  the choice has already been taken away from you.  Someone who thinks they know better will tell him, and if he gets the story from someone else,  they will put their own spin on it, and it will not be the truth.  Honestly,  you could read the first four paragraphs here to him about what happened, as they are beautifully written, and then explain your concerns.  But,  I would also see if you could quickly consult a lawyer too, especially if there is a chance that he will want to meet her.  There is a real possibility that if she gets a toehold,  she can go back to court and get regular visitation, or even custody arrangements.   You may need to protect yourselves against that.", "NTA - Tell your neighbors where to stick their opinion.", "Don\u2019t tell your Son what happened until he\u2019s much older. Do whatever you have to do to keep him safe and stable.", "INFO\n\nWhat have you told Leo about his mother and what happened when she bailed?", "NTA - she will find a way to contact him.  Soon.  If he hears her side of the story before he gets yours, things will become much more complicated.  He's old enough to know your truth, and even if he isn't, that choice will be taken from you regardless.", "NTA\n\nBut I do think that it's best that you sit down with Leo and talk to him about this in an age appropriate way.\n\nStick to the facts about why she hasn't been in his life so far, and make sure you're honest with him about why you are worried given that she's turned up now.\n\nYou don't sound bitter in what you've posted, to your credit, so try to keep that same energy to let Leo make his mind up about whether he would like her in his life or not - and also let him know that it's his decision and he can change his mind later if he wishes to do so. It's also important not to badmouth Lisa to reinforce that Leo needs to make his own mind up about her, and to protect you against any legal bullshit she and/or her family may try to pull in the future.\n\nIt is going to be so much better that he hears this coming from you, rather than hearing bits of information and allowing a 10/11 year old imagination to fill in the gaps.\n\nI wish you all the best, this is a difficult situation and from what you've said you're already doing a great job as a dad.", "NTA.  Keep her away.  Her and her whole toxic family.

She has no claim on your son right now and she certainly doesn't get to just show up, INSULTING YOU, and demanding time and attention from a little boy who doesn't even know her. As for other people in town, it's amazing how the parent that *stays* is the one that gets blamed by others. Make sure that his school knows she cannot collect him, and get in touch with a lawyer who can advise you. She didn't care what it did to you or your son when she left. And she doesn't care what it will do to you both now that she's back.", "NTA\n\nA kid isn\u2019t a toy you can play with for a bit, lose interest in and box it away, and come back when you take a fancy to it again.", "NTA. she made the choice to completely abandon her son years ago, and now she has to live with that choice. assuming you\u2019re the one with custody, you get to make the decisions for your son. i\u2019d maybe tell him about her at this point since you said rumours get around, bc that\u2019s something he\u2019d rather hear from you than through a rumour.", "Everyone else hit the jackpot. You\u2019re not the asshole. She made her decision to cease communication and all relationship ties when she decided to abandon her family. While I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to tell a ten year old the situation, if it is highly possible for your son to catch wind of the situation through gossip, try to tell him in the most ten year old comprehensible way possible. It is kind of an adult topic to speak so it\u2019s important to reconstruct it for your child to understand. It\u2019ll mean a lot to them later down the road.", "NTA. Get a lawyer asap!

Maybe don't tell him everything just yet but stay giving him some of the pieces of the puzzle and make sure he knows he can come to you for anything. Questions, concerns, if somebody said something shady to him about her. Just anything. Because the truth is, in a small town he's probably already heard some things and he thinks HE'S protecting YOU by not saying anything about it. Someone will say something to him. It's small town mentality. They think everybody's business is their business and they meddle.", "NTA in anyway. However, it\u2019s a small town and kids talk. I wouldn\u2019t give him the whole story I don\u2019t think, maybe I would, it would depend on if he can handle it. Some 10 year olds can, some can\u2019t. But I digress. I would give him a heads up about what\u2019s going on now. He\u2019s 10. Kids gossip like crazy. He\u2019s going to hear about it and he may hear you are keeping him from her. Give him the info first.", "NTA. Please inform your son before she tries to behind your back you can spare the details about exactly what happenedand dave those for later if he asks. He deserves to know that when he was a baby, she just left and you have no clue why. Also, let him know that you told her no until she can prove she's not going to do it again and actually wants a relationship with him. Because you want him to be happy and safe, but if he still wants to meet her, he can, and it's his choice.\n\nHe should still have the right to meet her of his own volition and if he does want to meet her only let her see him in supervised settings.

She abandoned her child real bold of her to assume the answer wouldn\u2019t be a resounding no.", "Super strong NTA. My parents separated when I was 5 years old, and I was raised by my Mom. I held a lot of anger against my Dad for a really long time, but eventually I was able to accept that my Dad is who he is, not the person I want him to be. I don\u2019t want to go into detail, but my point is that for a 10 -11 year old child, something like that isn\u2019t easy to wrap your head around. \n\nAnd considering how she reacted so immaturely when you said no, I think she has shown she is still not ready to be a part of your son\u2019s life. I think she needs to prove to you that she has changed and that she won\u2019t just abandon your son when things get tough. However, I also see where other people are coming from and that your son may be curious as to who his mother is. \n\nI would maybe suggest trying to seek out a mental health care professional, for both you and your son. Therapy was something I utilized to get me through my parents divorce, and still utilize today to deal with anxiety. Talking to someone may allow you and your son to process this situation that you\u2019re going through, and a psychologist could also help you devise a healthy plan for how to handle the situation going forward.", "Firstly, thank you for sticking by your son and raising him. Thank you for getting the custody rights, too.   I dont know what your ex is thinking, but you don't  dip out of parenting for a decade and then stroll back as if nothing happened. \n\nYou need to tell your son that it may be worth getting a therapist involved in this and the school. So that he has support from all areas, as he will be processing some pretty big emotions whilst hitting puberty. \n\nIf therapy is not an option, maybe you and your dad  have a a long weekend ith him. Take him away somewhere,  and bring up that this weekend is for him  and that he can ask ant questions he wants  at whatever pace he wants.  He will always get an answer.  Some may be uncomfortable, and that's OK, as he is growing up, he will be treated as such. \n\nWithout knowing what has been explained to him. About his mother previously, it may be worth approaching like this..\n\n\" x   some things have happened recently that mean we have to have some important designs to make together. \n\nThese are in regards to your biological mother.   I have explained x to you previously. Recently, she made contact  asking to see you.    I refused her as there were things she needed to acknowledge before she gest to turn up. \n\nI need to explain to you why we have not seen her. When you were 7 months old. She left you with grandad, took all of her things, and left.  You, i or grandad did nothing wrong. This was her chouce alone. She did not give a reason. We tried hard to contact her and her parents. We never got a response. When you were a year old, I was granted full legal custody of you.  A parent can not just disappear and walk away from all major decisions. Full custody meant that I could make all the choices on your school, health, medial, etc  .   I truly have had no idea where she has been for the last 10 years.  Whilst I was shocked to see her. What she wants is not my concern.   What s my concern s what you want and need. \n\nI want you to take some time. You may have lots of questions. Some I may be able to answer  some I may not. But we can seek the answers together.   I have to protect you first and foremost, but your thoughts and feelings are my priority and I need to consider your needs first.  X is an adult and a total stranger.to us. Whatever you decided, i will repsect,  you only need to think about what you want. Not anybody else.   \"\n\nId buy him a notebook to be able to write down what he is feeling or any questions. Let him.lnow that it is his  and he dosne not have to share if he does not want to. He may want to write her a letter. He may want nothing to do with her.  If he wishes to meet her  I would start with a joint session of you and her with a Councillor to get to the bottom of why she is actually seeking contact. You don't know what she is cabable of or where she is emotionally. So she could do more harm.  There, absolutely needs to be an apology and recognition of abandonment.   If she can not give suitable answers, or it's clear she is out for herself. Then, have a second session with the councillors and your child. They need to be prepared that any meeting may not be what they are expecting.  Any contact should be made with a therapist to help support your child. It also keeps someone in the room.with out the emotional link to prevent emotional.outbusrts from the adults.\n\nDon't mention child support, financial burdens or anything similar around your child. Those need to be brought up with her 1 -2-1.   \n\nJust be there for him.  Incidently include your dad in all of this.
