We started dating and after a year she accidentally got pregnant. I felt I was too young to be a father but decided that, if she wanted to keep the baby, I would have taken care of them. She changed her mind a dozen times but in the end she decided to keep the child. So I did what I had to do: our families weren't rich so I left college, found a job and started preparing for the child. \n\nMy son, Leo, was born in June. I worked impossible hours, spent whatever was left of my time taking care of Leo and my mother spent a lot of time at our apartment to help taking care of Leo. Linda's parents did basically nothing. They told me in my face that I was not welcome in their home and they spent a total of 2 hours with Leo in the months following his birth.\n\nWhen Leo was 7 months old, Linda bailed on us. One day she called my father to come help taking care of Leo, he went to our apartment and she wasn't there: Leo was sleeping in his crib and Linda's belongings were gone together with the money left in the house. I tried contacting her and going to her parent's home but they weren't there and she never answered the phone.\n\nIt's been 11 years since then. Now it's just me, Leo and my father. My mother unfortunately passed away last year. Despite all the problems we had Leo has grown up to be an amazing, cheerful and smart kid. He is my pride and joy and I will do anything to protect him and make him happy. He doesn't remember his mother \n\nFew weeks ago Linda showed up at my door in the middle of the day. She asked to talk and I reluctantly agreed. \n\nTo sum it up what she said: she is sorry for what she did and wants to be part of Leo's life again. I told her NO. She begged and then said some unkind thing about me as a person when I refused again.  I told her I do not care what she think. Until Leo is old enough to make a choice, she will not see him. After he is old enough, I will tell him the truth and he will decide on his own accord what he wants to do.\n\nSince, unfortunately, we live in a small town where rumors spread rapidly, I'm now being judged by some neighbors for my reaction. I don't think I am in the wrong here and my family agree with me but I guess another opinion would be welcomed since I'm basically going crazy.

At best, she is an unreliable person who is always a threat to devastate him when she abandons him again, at worst she has returned to use him to get money or resources from you.\n\nThe utter nerve if her to make demands after what she did.

I\u2019m going to second others suggestions about getting the legal stuff solidified YESTERDAY. Make sure the court knows she left a 7 month old ALONE. \n\nAlso, find a family therapist, maybe one outside of your little town who isn\u2019t already biased by hearing about it and talk to them yourself. Set up a time and place to quickly tell Leo what\u2019s happening. Not every sordid detail but in a small town he\u2019s going to hear it and it\u2019s best he gets the strait info from you.

I may also want to see her getting some kind of therapy if that was what it took to make me feel that she wouldn't abandon him again.  I do have to admit that her anger response is a bit troubling - the degree of which depends on exactly what \"unkind\" things she said.\n\nAt that point I would feel my son out to find out where his mind is at on that - likely without letting him know yet that she was back.\n\nBased on all of that, I would make my decision.  Ideally, it is best for kids to know and love both parents - but I would definitely want to be sure that she wouldn't hurt him again so would proceed with caution but, if at all possible, I would allow the relationship to develop.  11 years is a long time, and people can do a lot of growing in that time.\n\nOne other thing to consider... you may have no choice but to discuss the matter with your son.  With this being a small town and the people having strong opinions, someone somewhere will very likely tell him what's going on... and it is far better to come from you.  Also - not sure of the laws where you are, but if she takes you to court for visitation, you may then lose the control over when/where/how often she sees him.", "She can see your son when she comes up with 11 years of child support payments and a written apology for child abandonment and theft \n\nNTA - you\u2019re protecting your son - she gave up the rights to be involved in his life the moment she left him alone and ran off", "NTA that chick is an awful human being.

He reappeared when the child was 10 yo, saying the same things Linda said. I said his guilt was his own to work out but I was not introducing him into my child\u2019s life after 10 years of abandonment. \nIn my case my spouse had adopted the child (the biological father could not sign away his rights quickly enough) so legally he had no standing. \nWhen my child was 15 they wanted to meet biological dad, and I arranged it. It didn\u2019t work out well and now, almost 10 years later, they are estranged again. \n\nOP, your son is too young to meet this person, imho. I hope you have had discussions with him as to why his mother has not been in his life until now, and if you haven\u2019t do it asap. But he does not need this chaos in his life simply because after 11 years she had a change of heart. \nBased on my experience if your son wants to meet her at some point, you should facilitate that, but only because *your son* wants it, not because Linda is pushing for it. \nAnd if he doesn\u2019t have one already, I recommend your son work with a therapist to help him navigate the feelings he has over his mother\u2019s abandonment, and to help sort through the meeting with the mother, should there ever be one.", "NTA you have sole custody of your minor child (who is 11, which can still be pretty immature and vulnerable).

Ultimately there's a good chance the court would err on the side of caution and allow that anyway.\n\nI would also tell your son that his mother abandoned you both, and stole from you, and that she hasn't once asked about him in the intervening time.
