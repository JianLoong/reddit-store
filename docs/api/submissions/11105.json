We have a 4y and 6mo who will be coming.\n\nMy sister (f18) has a 9mo. Her BD is barely around. He owes 2k+ in CS, and sees baby once every 2wks (He cancels the 3x wk visits). After the split (he cheated w/ 6+ girls while she was preg/pp, including our younger sister.) he gave her his junk car. Not her fault (shitty mechanic) it\u2019s been 6mo and still no working car. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for her. That\u2019s my little sister (not the skanky one) and life isn\u2019t good to her rn. \n\nToday I was visiting her with my kids, and she asked what I was doing. I was typing up the itinerary. She asked where we were going, and how long. I told her the plan, and she asked if anyone else was going with us. I said it was just us, but if she wanted to go, and could pitch in some money, I\u2019d ask my husband. \n\nI reached out, and it went:\n\nMe: Sister wants to go with us?\n\nHusband: No. It\u2019s me you and the kids. I want a vacation with my wife and kids \n\nM: She could pitch in on gas\u2026\n\nH: No\n\nM: And more help with driving \n\nH: No. \n\nM: And somebody to help with watching the kids so we can have a date\n\nH: No. I want this to be a vacation for us babe\n\nM: And somebody to help keep us awake while driving\n\nH: We will be fine \n\nM: I know. But I feel bad. She has no money, no partner, no car, and no help. She has a little girl and herself. She doesn\u2019t have a chance or the help to go do this. \n\nH: We will talk about it later \n\nLater came. We talked. I said I don\u2019t want her to not do the fun things families do, all because her ex is a POS. That\u2019s my sister and my niece and I want them to enjoy life and have fun, despite BD leaving her high and dry. He agreed and \u201cloved her and our niece very much\u201d, but doesn\u2019t want them interfering with family time. (We are high school sweethearts, and every vacation we\u2019ve ever been on was with my whole family). \n\nI said it made sense but we would just lend her the car while we spent time as a family, and that she could have fun, without \u201cinterfering\u201d. He agreed, but wasn\u2019t thrilled. He said it shouldn\u2019t interfere with what we already have planned. I said that to my sister, she agreed then offered money to pitch in. \n\nIt\u2019s been 4 hours and he just told me he didn\u2019t want to say yes. He wanted to just have family time. He said I was an AH for asking and that it\u2019s ruining vacation. He thought I should \u201cknow how he feels\u201d. I really didn\u2019t know her coming could upset him this much. He\u2019s NEVER complained about vacationing with my family. \n\nI can\u2019t uninvite my sister. She\u2019s already arranging to go (she has a cat, and obviously needs to notify BD that she\u2019s leaving for a week and a half). \n\nAITA? Or was I right to include my sister?

You are acting selfishly right now and worse you\u2019re doing it under the guise of being nice. \n\nIf you want to prioritize your relationship with your sister or other family members, that is your prerogative.

Yes you can uninvite her actually. You don't WANT to, because that will be embarrassing and painful for you both and may affect the relationship for a while. But you brought those consequences on yourself when you invited her first, asked your husband second. You two are partners. You're supposed to make decisions together, especially about things that affect the whole family unit. You wanted to do a nice thing for her, but what you actually did was not nice to her, your husband, or your kids. It was about making yourself feel good by treating your life partner's feelings as irrelevant. Judging by that transcript, he's used to you crossing boundaries and then pretending not to hear the first 20 times he says no to you impulsively doing whatever the heck you want to.\n\nWhen you uninvite your sister, don't you dare blame your husband one little bit. Own your role. You wronged her when you chose to speak prematurely, without bothering to find out your partner's feelings at all. He's not the bad guy in this situation.

It seems you go out of your way to accommodate your sister at the expense of your family.  Vacationing on a road trip with three children - two of whom are in diapers does not sound like a fun, relaxing, family bonding time to me.  I also suspect that you and your sister when you are together reminisce about events that your husband is not privy to - leaving him out.  You don't see how he could be willing to leave her alone - humm, seems like ALL of your former vacations involve your family - maybe, just maybe he'd like to be alone with his wife and children for a change.  Here's an idea - how about investing your time and energy into your spouse and children instead of your siblings and parents.  How about putting your family first?", "YTA.

That\u2019s my little sister (not the skanky one) and life isn\u2019t good to her rn. \n\nToday I was visiting her with my kids, and she asked what I was doing. I was typing up the itinerary. She asked where we were going, and how long. I told her the plan, and she asked if anyone else was going with us. I said it was just us, but if she wanted to go, and could pitch in some money, I\u2019d ask my husband. \n\nI reached out, and it went:\n\nMe: Sister wants to go with us?\n\nHusband: No. It\u2019s me you and the kids. I want a vacation with my wife and kids \n\nM: She could pitch in on gas\u2026\n\nH: No\n\nM: And more help with driving \n\nH: No. \n\nM: And somebody to help with watching the kids so we can have a date\n\nH: No. I want this to be a vacation for us babe\n\nM: And somebody to help keep us awake while driving\n\nH: We will be fine \n\nM: I know. But I feel bad. She has no money, no partner, no car, and no help. She has a little girl and herself. She doesn\u2019t have a chance or the help to go do this. \n\nH: We will talk about it later \n\nLater came. We talked. I said I don\u2019t want her to not do the fun things families do, all because her ex is a POS. That\u2019s my sister and my niece and I want them to enjoy life and have fun, despite BD leaving her high and dry. He agreed and \u201cloved her and our niece very much\u201d, but doesn\u2019t want them interfering with family time. (We are high school sweethearts, and every vacation we\u2019ve ever been on was with my whole family). \n\nI said it made sense but we would just lend her the car while we spent time as a family, and that she could have fun, without \u201cinterfering\u201d. He agreed, but wasn\u2019t thrilled. He said it shouldn\u2019t interfere with what we already have planned. I said that to my sister, she agreed then offered money to pitch in. \n\nIt\u2019s been 4 hours and he just told me he didn\u2019t want to say yes. He wanted to just have family time. He said I was an AH for asking and that it\u2019s ruining vacation. He thought I should \u201cknow how he feels\u201d. I really didn\u2019t know her coming could upset him this much. He\u2019s NEVER complained about vacationing with my family. \n\nI can\u2019t uninvite my sister. She\u2019s already arranging to go (she has a cat, and obviously needs to notify BD that she\u2019s leaving for a week and a half). \n\nAITA? Or was I right to include my sister? I understand where he\u2019s coming from, I would love just a family vacation, but I can\u2019t honestly leave my sister behind when she has no help.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Good luck with yourself.", "YTA if you keep overriding your husband and showing him that he doesn\u2019t matter, you and your sister can be single moms together. How neat! /s", "Okay, besides all of the rude comments let\u2019s be rational here, you\u2019re young so you may not see every points of view. YTA. \n\nI get that your sister is going through a rough time, but it is not your job to \u201ctake care\u201d of her. She was big enough to make her decision to stay with her BD in the past, and also made the decision to keep her child. She has been doing well taking care of her child on her own despite not having stable income. It will be her responsibility to take care of her mental health and well-being unless she ASKS you for help. That is the boundary you/she needs to make. \n\nI come from an Asian family, and everything is literally about family, and sometimes sacrificing your mental health and well-being for them. There were times I\u2019ve lost jobs because I felt obligated to be there for my family. But when do you get to say \u201cenough is enough\u201d and start taking care of yourself? So I get wanting to love, care, and be there for family, but as you get married and start a family you can\u2019t compromise your own family for what your parents had already established. Think of it this way, your parents had children to take care of them. It is their job to take care of them and nobody else. Likewise, you take care of your own children. Worrying about EVERYONE will only drive you mad. It\u2019s easier for me to think of it this way, because in many Asian cultures, when you marry, you literally are considered a stranger to your birth family. Marriage is the start of YOUR life. \n\nNow here is where YTA. It wasn\u2019t a bad idea to invite your sister, but it was bad to dismiss your husband\u2019s feelings when you both discussed this. His feelings hold just as much value as yours, and it seemed like all he wanted to do was spend quality time with you and your kids without distraction. Believe it or not, road trips, although boring, can make up for some quality time. You guys had originally planned for it to just be a family thing and he was excited for some of that family time, but now he has to rearrange what was already made to accommodate a person who is clearly capable of taking care of herself. Hours in a car will be interrupted because he has to worry about you, his kids, your sister and her child. That is a lot of responsibility to put on him. He doesn\u2019t hate your sister (if you come to this conclusion), he legitimately wants IMMEDIATE family time with no distractions. \n\nDon\u2019t worry about your sister, OP. I get that you love her and you have every right to want to protect her from her pain. But this isn\u2019t something you can fix with a road trip. We can talk about what is fucked up and try to use those means to justify our actions, but in reality your sister needs to be able to turn the tides on her own. Simply reminding yourself what is fucked up will not get you anywhere unless you do something about it. She will reach out to you when she needs help and you should only extend your hand when you CAN help. Go on that road trip with your family. Your sister will be just fine.", "Yta he told you in this first text NO ITS ME YOU AND THE KIDS, so how are you going to say you don\u2019t think this isn\u2019t going to interfere with your vacation.. it will  / has because your husband is upset and you haven\u2019t even left yet so she\u2019s already interfered, with you spearheading the issue..if you were smart Tell your sister that your sorry but your husband and you talked again and this isn\u2019t a good idea.

Really consider the fact that compromise involves both parties listening to each other and reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. This is not mutually beneficial, and you didn\u2019t listen to him when he told you he didn\u2019t want this. Planning a trip is stressful enough; it\u2019s even worse when you have to take into account another person, their baby,their cat, their emotional baggage, and making room for them with your family unit on the trip.

Open your damn ears.", "I'm sure your husband does have a load of sympathy for her, doesn't stop him wanting a family only holiday.", "Your head is as thick as a rock. You and your sister are both drama-filled and immature and way too young to be married or parents. Your post and comments prove this. \nKeep this kind of bonding up with your sister because you\u2019ll need her to lean on when your husband has had enough of your selfishness, dismissiveness, and disrespect.\nYou are giving me a headache and I\u2019m not even married to you.\nYou are the asshole.", "You dont need validation from internet strangers to \"see where she is\" or \"why you have sympathy for her.\" Its unfortunate the situation shes in but it isnt justification for bringing her on the trip against your husband's wishes. Your husband can have sympathy, but it doesn't need to be at the expense of your family vacation. He said \"no.\" End of story.", "He said no multiple times & even spelled it out for you that he wanted THIS TRIP to be just the two of you & your kids. YTA for not listening & pushing after the first time he said no. It's pretty clear that you were never going to take his feelings into account & only cared about your sister's instead. If you don't stop pushing him & his feelings aside you're going to be single like your sister & it will be all *your* fault. \n\nIf you want her to go see her friend & get some time away, then help her get the money to go herself & *not* on your family vacation. Tell her there was a miscommunication & that *you* messed up by inviting her & that you're sorry, but she & your niece can't come with you. Don't you dare make him the bad guy when you caused this. I know you won't like this, but if you care at all about your husband, kids, & marriage you will do it & not be upset at him for saying no for once to vacationing with your family to placate you & the guilt you like to wear like a badge of honor.", "One date night vs a family vacation? Stop", "True, almost like the baby trap failed to close on the prey haha", "I can definitely agree with that. Getting back with a cheater is really stupid, but she was like 17? 16? It's an just really messed up all around. Gotta ask where the parents were in all this.", "This is not your husband\u2019s problem.", "This gave me flashbacks.", "Her veri messy family* baby daddies cheating with younger sisters. I'd want a vacation free of all that disaster", "People who get back with a cheater in facht ACCEPT the cheating.", "She KNEW he did not want it.", "It seems like all three of these sisters are just a roller coaster of fun."]}
