A friend of mine (23M) also just graduated college nearby and last weekend was moving off campus.

He also said he would help me move as a favor since he knows I'll need the extra set of hands.\n\nI show up Saturday morning and he immediately seemed off.  I didn't think much of it, but him and his family seemed very cold towards me.  There wasn't much interaction though because most of the day was spent driving, so I chalked it up to the stress of moving.  He does have a few pieces of long furniture that were too big and heavy for my truck, so they wound up driving over to U-Haul (American truck rental company) to move those out, but they said I didn't need to stick around since they had enough people, and my truck wouldn't move that stuff anyway.\n\nNow that I closed on my home, I was talking to him about when he'd be available to help me move.  He got mad at this question and told me that I \"lied\" to him about having a truck, and that I clearly was trying to trick him into helping despite my truck not being able to haul his large furniture.\n\nI was shocked.  He never told me he was moving such large items, or else I would have told him the bed of my truck wasn't that big.

Loved the truck because of how comfy the inside was, but it's not like I was out there every day loading it up like a commercial.\n\nI had actually looked at the Maverick because I live in a city and still like the ability to move things, but ended up with the Bronco Sport (same wheelbase) mostly because I figured it'd be more useful to have stuff inside the cab for road trips.

No I didn't think he had an L-shaped desk that was all one piece either.\n\nA truck is useful for a move because while a sedan can fit like \\~3 big boxes at best, a truck can double stack those same bins and go on for the length of the vehicle.

Most mavericks can tow 2000 pounds with the awd model with proper gearing taking it up to 4000. The 1990 ranger goes up to 6300 pounds. It's also kind of irrelevant because you are comparing a modern vehicle to one that is decades old. And while the right maverick may be rated for 4000 pounds that is not going to be a comfortable tow experience and probably shouldn't be done on the regular. The ranger when equipped with four wheel drive is going to be a lot more capable offroad than the maverick. Payload figures are really good for the maverick but the cubic feet of the bed is lower compared to midsized trucks."]}
