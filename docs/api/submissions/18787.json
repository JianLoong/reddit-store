Right after New Year's my car was stolen during the whole viral Hyundai incident that resulted in countless Hyundai thefts in the span of a few short weeks across the country.  There was a delay in getting my total loss check because the car was found right before the money was dispersed and the insurance company tried to get it fixed because it wasn't in the worst shape.  They wound up deeming it a total loss after the timeline revealed that a parts shortage would mean storage fees of over four to five months before it could even be started on.  I used the money to purchase a used 2022 Ford Maverick with only a few thousand miles on it, frankly I was very lucky.\n\nThe whole time I've been doubling down on my house search to get out of that area, and happy to say I got a house and finished closing this week.  A friend of mine (23M) also just graduated college nearby and last weekend was moving off campus.  He asked me to help him move since I told him I just got a truck, which I was more than happy to do.  He also said he would help me move as a favor since he knows I'll need the extra set of hands.\n\nI show up Saturday morning and he immediately seemed off.  I didn't think much of it, but him and his family seemed very cold towards me.  There wasn't much interaction though because most of the day was spent driving, so I chalked it up to the stress of moving.  He does have a few pieces of long furniture that were too big and heavy for my truck, so they wound up driving over to U-Haul (American truck rental company) to move those out, but they said I didn't need to stick around since they had enough people, and my truck wouldn't move that stuff anyway.\n\nNow that I closed on my home, I was talking to him about when he'd be available to help me move.  He got mad at this question and told me that I \"lied\" to him about having a truck, and that I clearly was trying to trick him into helping despite my truck not being able to haul his large furniture.\n\nI was shocked.  He never told me he was moving such large items, or else I would have told him the bed of my truck wasn't that big.  For reference, my truck has a 54\" bed (1.37 meters) while a Ford F-150 truck bed is usually 66-96\" (1.67-2.44 meters) depending on model choice.\n\nBased on his reaction and unwillingness to help me move, I am curious if I was in the wrong for this whole situation.  Him and his family say claiming to own a truck comes with \"certain standards and expectations\" when offering to help someone move.  Our other friends say that he's in the wrong for backing out after agreeing to help all because he made a lot of assumptions without mentioning the large items, but I can't help but feel bad for how the whole situation went down.", "created_utc": 1685714101, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ydhw8/aita_for_claiming_i_have_a_truck/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes the maverick looks like a truck and I actually like the mav but it is more of a Australia UTE akin to a el camino or ranchero. But him assuming your truck was a full size without telling you what he expected to move is bold and blaming you is bullshit. Also one truck guy to a new one with a minitruck Never tell friends you have a truck they will use and abuse you for your truck especially when/if you get a fullsize one.

As a former owner of a short-bed truck myself I promise you this is something that is going to come up frequently, people have a size in their head about what can fit in a 'pickup truck.' If there hadn't been a U-Haul available that morning, this could have turned into a real clusterfuck.\n\nOTOH, he ought to have confirmed with you himself, and he's way out of line accusing you of intentionally misleading him.

A truck is a truck, this one is just 2/3 the size of other models so it can't tow as much weight.", "Even a new f150 wouldn\u2019t fit a plywood sheet in its bed.

The only issue you\u2019d run into is not being big enough to actually carry large items, but realistically you can strap it down tight and go slow on small roads instead of going on the freeway."]}
