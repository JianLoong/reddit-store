She had just gotten back from a girls ski trip and when they were extremely drunk, her friend (my Dr B) slipped up and mentioned that she saw me recently for an increase in my dosage and basically revealed to my sister that I have been taking prescription vyvanse for a few years now.

I\u2019ve known Dr B my entire life, as long as my sister has - she was my sister\u2019s friend since they were in first grade and they\u2019ve remained close and we\u2019ve hung out with our families on multiples occasions over the years. We\u2019ve even gone on trips together including my sister\u2019s bachelorette. I always looked up to her and found her cool growing up. She and my sister both have kids around the same age and they\u2019re close as well. She currently brings in the bigger chunk of the income in their family and they rely on it and my sister keeps reminding me that I\u2019m also ruining two innocent children\u2019s lives in the process, which is the only thing I feel guilt about. I adore those kids and they don\u2019t deserve that. But I also cannot get over how betrayed I feel. I always keep a safe distance between personal and professional relationships and would\u2019ve never picked her to be my doctor had the circumstances not unfolded the way it did.

But since you say she is a lifelong friend, i think you should give her an opportunity to explain things from her perspective,  and most importantly, allow her an opportunity to make things right in with you  in some way.

Maybe she deserves to.\n\nBut it is always possible that things didnt go down exactly in the way your sister said. Iam at a loss to understand how she could've gotten this information otherwise.\n \nBut when you discuss with her, if you start by saying you believe she has violated HIPPA  that should get her attention.\n\nLastly, unless you recorded your sister saying that your doctor discussed your office visit and medications with her, im not sure reporting it will accomplish anything because if your doctor denies she discussed your private medical information, you dont have any proof otherwise. So you may want to discuss with your sister again, but not like you are upset, just casually bring it up again, (while recording her) and say something like you had alot going on at the time she mentioned it before, but could she refresh your memory again on how she knew about your  health information.\n\nOne other thought if your doctor is in a group or in a partnership with other doctors, her discussing your health information is a risk to them as well and most physician's have insurance to cover them in case someone sues them for things of this nature.  \n\nI used to work in hospitals as a chief information officer so i am very familiar with the ramifications of physicians, nurses and other staff not keeping patients' health info private. This is a very very serious offense.  Im seen doctors & staff fired for things like you have described.  Ive also seen patients sue doctors for violating their privacy.

This means they aren't allowed to get a digital file on me.

I could actually sue the hospital for up to 10k or so if I wanted, as a sidenote, because this isn't something European Union's law will joke about!\n\nThe doc called me and was all scared, and I told her it's fine if she writes the summary of my case, and then deletes everything. It's highly unlikely my mother will check the pregnancy ward files without a hint - which also would be a violation of privacy, and I would absolutely sue her, and the hospital, if I ever caught on.\n\nThe doc was mortified as she heard the reason I wanted my data out of the system. It never occurred to her a staff member could abuse the intranet like that. She promised to get my data deleted.\n\nStill waiting on this summary.

HIPAA is serious and she should have respected your privacy. NTA. Plus if reported maybe she will think twice about sharing again. And you don't know what else she may have shared about you to your sister and you don't know if she shares other patients personal information.", "NTA\n\nObviously\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, the doctor is unlikely to lose her job over a single HIPAA infraction. I would not let guilt over ruining the lives of her children guide your choices.  \n\nBUT your sister will definitely tell the rest of your family if you rat on her friend.  If that is your biggest fear, then keep in mind, it will come true.  Your sister is only keeping her mouth shut now because she is trying to protect her friend.\n\nIn your position, I probably would not report.  But I would call your doctor, chew her out, and make it very clear to her that the only reason you are NOT reporting her is because you don't want to further risk the public spread of your private information.  I would also point out that it took mere days for your sister to rat out her friend for spilling private medical information, to attack you for being a potential drug addict, and to make it clear that she has no faith in her friend's medical abilities, since she thinks her friend is prescribing unnecessary drugs.  Essentially, I would at least try to damage their friendship on the way out the door.  I would finally make it clear that I would no longer be using her services, and I would advise anyone who asks that I found her to be an unethical and untrustworthy physician.", "NTA. Truthfully she never should have taken you on as a patient in the first place. The fact she's been your sisters best friend for so long is a HUGE conflict of interest. There's a reason Dr's don't treat friends and family unless there's literally no other option. Also she SHOULD be reported! Drunk or not she has no right to tell your sister or anyone for that matter anything about your medical history or the medications you're on.", "NTA.  This is messed up!", "I disagree with parts of the commenting. 1) I agree that the Dr and sister were wrong, and agree with talking to the doctor. In that conversation I'd ask how often this happens, and what does the DOC think you should do and what the doc would do if she was in your situation.\n\nWhere I disagree is how this came about. The issue is that everyone knows everyone, which isn't good, and in this area of the story, OP should have known to not see a friend. However, when the doc and sis and friends went out and had too much to drink, OP's name night have come out because the doc knows her. The doc was on a casual group, and her behavior was looser from drinking. In Another scenario the doctor might have said \"a patient of mine...\" but since there is a connection, the name came out. I distort that's how it happened. Many of us gossip but hold back the names. In this case, the unique nature of this meant the name was going come out.", "NTA and you should report the HIPAA violation.", "Totally unethical, but could your silence buy your sister's silence? That the minute sister blabs to family is the minute you sue???", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t do it. This may be unethical but this is what I would do. Start a group chat with just the two of them. Say Dr B was incredibly unprofessional to blab your medical info to your sister. Say that if your sister ever leaks this info to the rest of your family or anyone else, you\u2019ll report Dr B for HIPAA violations. If Dr B discloses your info again, you would report her. It would ensure both of their silence. And it may ruin their friendship because they will likely blame each other and they are both equally at fault. But their ruined relationship wouldn\u2019t be any of your business. And the agreement (blackmail?) would still stand whether they remain friends or not.", "NTA, obviously the doctor was wrong for sharing your information but why in the world did your sister repeat it?! If I was her friend I\u2019d be more pissed at her than you. Report her OP and don\u2019t look back.", "HARD NTA...She might be your sister's best friend but first of all, she's your doctor. As a medical student myself one of the first things they teach us is that the patient's privacy is one of the most important things to keep, everything that a patient tells you and confides to you is completely private unless is something ilegal. So I say, report her.", "NTA. She violated your rights. She fucked around and now she needs to find out.", "NTA If the doctor did this to you, she's probably done it / will do it to other patients.", "NTA but yeah don\u2019t wonder when ur sister never talk to you again", "NTA.report her.", "NTA. There\u2019s no way you are the only breach of her ethics, she just said it to the wrong person this time. You deserve privacy and she should learn a lesson on finding out.", "I used to be Mormon. My therapist was Mormon. I was late to an appointment and overheard her talking. I assumed she had another client and was backing away when I heard my name mentioned. She was actually on the phone telling my Bishop everything I said in therapy.\n\nI complained and reported to her professional body which censured her and I wrote to her saying that if she didn't refund every penny I had paid for therapy I would sue for much more.\nI invested that money in a PlayStation 5 instead.", "NTA Not only did she breach ethics in revealing your personal information\u2026 she arguably breached ethics in taking you on as a patient when you have such a close family history with her.

HIPPA exists for a reason.\n\nBeing a doctor requires a lot of trust and discretion and focusing on helping patients. Not gossiping about their personal health. They simply are not qualified to be a doctor.\n\nOther jobs exist. Her children won\u2019t be homeless. Maybe they won\u2019t have a doctor\u2019s salary, but she should be working in a profession where she isn\u2019t illegally disclosing personal medical information.", "NTA - your doctor is well aware she violated HIPAA & you need to report it. I work in research and we take HIPAA training every year. It\u2019s super clear what we can and cannot do with private health information. This doctor  should be called out. The family dynamic sucks, but no matter what other people think, your accomplishments are real no matter how you get there. If you used mobility devices, hearing aids, or glasses would you feel the same way? Medications that help you live your best life are not cheating at life.\n\nEDIT TO ADD: Drop this doctor _IMMEDIATELY_!", "NTA. Your sister is definitely TA. I would go against the popular opinion and say I wouldn\u2019t report Dr. B, but terminate this relationship and find another doctor asap. While she did let your medial info slip, the way your sister used that information is more problematic and it\u2019s also what\u2019s ultimately making you so upset. \n\nWhat your sister said to you and the way she said it (doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s joking) reminds me of some of my own (NC) family members, and it made me extra worried that you mentioned most of your family are high achievers who don\u2019t believe in ADHD. It was also a very ignorant thing to say as people don\u2019t get addicted to ADHD drugs the way they do with highly addictive but poorly regulated pain meds\u2014it can only be interpreted as an insult to your condition as a result of her own ignorance. If I were you I\u2019d re-evaluate my relationship with your sister and potentially other family members too. At the end of the day it\u2019s your decision to report Dr. B or not (if it\u2019s not going to lead to serious outcome, I\u2019d do it), but I hope you\u2019re not using it as an excuse to not confront your sister about her behaviour. \n\nIf your family looked at you any less because of your condition, it\u2019s completely on them, but I can understand not wanting them to find out at the moment. Just know that it is a common neurodevelopmental condition and nothing to be ashamed of.", "Nta.  You have every right to feel the way you do, and would have every right to report your doctor.  I would suggest you try not to burn bridges though.  While your family doesn't sound super great, it doesn't sound like the kind of family you'd be fine with cutting out of your life entirely, and reporting her would make being around your sister very stressful.  Plus the feeling of guilt over her kids getting caufht up in this would not be great for you either.  If your biggest concern going forward is your parents finding out, tell your sister that if she so much as hints to anyone that your on medication, even if she teases you about it while no one is around or treats you differently now that she knows, then you'll report the doctor. And definitely meet with your doctor and chew her the heck out.  She needs to realize just how badly she screwed up and what effect it has had on you.  Make sure she knows that if anyone else finds out personal information about you then you will 100% be reporting her.  I'm sorry this happened to you, and you should know that your feelings of betrayal and disrespect are completely valid.  I'm just not sure that reporting her will make your life better going forward or that it's the only way to keep this from happening to someone else.", "Nta. But do confront the doctor first and let her know you will be reporting her.", "NTA. Report her. Also I don\u2019t know if she is breaking any ethics code by having you as a patient considering she\u2019s known you for almost your whole life and that is a MAJOR conflict of interest. Doctors here please answer that one for me. But like I said NTA and report her", "NTA\n\nOP please report this. If she has shared your personal medical information what\u2019s to say she hasn\u2019t or won\u2019t share other people\u2019s? Or that she won\u2019t tell you sister more details about you the next time they go out?\n\nIt\u2019s very telling what kind of person your sister is that she only cares about her friend in this situation and not you. You are the wronged party here, you are the one who was betrayed by your own doctor! \n\nUnfortunately, since your sister already knows and has already opened her mouth in front of your other siblings, you should prepare yourself for your whole family finding out. I suggest you tell them yourself before your sister has a chance to stretch the truth to make you look bad. \n\nYou will not be ruining anyone\u2019s life, hers or her children. She\u2019s a doctor, she knows that by sharing your private medical information she broke HIPAA. Any consequences from her actions are her fault, not yours. Your doctor will probably be fined, but that is in the hope she doesn\u2019t do this again. It will be investigated and if any further action is taken it will be because *she* fucked up, she broke the law, and she has probably done this before. \n\nSharing private medical information is against the law for a reason. Patients deserve to feel safe and secure opening up to their medical team, you obviously don\u2019t feel that way anymore. It\u2019s not only illegal but wildly inappropriate for a doctor to *ever* talk about their patients dosages and diagnosis to anyone not approved by said patient. And again I want to stress that if she told your sister who\u2019s to say she hasn\u2019t also blabbed other people\u2019s info??", "NTA what she did was illegal and you have every right to report her. Sisters friend or not! Sisters friend knew it was illegal to talk about you but did it anyways", "NTA.\nYou are not ruining Dr B's career, Dr. B ruined their own career by playing fast and loose with personal info.  But just because this action is morally justified doesn't mean it won't have consequences.  Do you think it will destroy your relationship with your sister if you do this?  Is it worth it to you if it gets an unethical doctor out of the practice?  Situations like this are EXACTLY why these laws were created in the first place.", "NTA. Doesn't matter how long and how close the families are. She violated Hippa and her oath as a Dr.  Let's put the blame where it belongs on your sister. Dr B screwed up royally however dearest sister told you she knew about your prescription. So she basically wants you to suck up her mistake of telling you", "N T A for wanting to do it. Obviously you're upset and feel betrayed - and the doctor was totally out of line for what she did. But YTA if you act on your feelings. Because doctors are human - they make mistakes. She didn't act with malicious intent - it was a mistake; and you don't have any reason to think she's habitually unethical - she was with her close friend in a social situation, she'd had too much to drink, and for an instant she crossed a boundary. She probably feels absolutely sick about it, and likely has been scared to death over the consequences. And let's not forget, this is someone who has been a family friend for a long time ... If you hurt her, your family will definitely know you're being treated for ADHD and they'll ALSO be mad at you for punishing her.\n\nI think this is a time to show grace. If your sister shares the information, you will be uncomfortable - because apparently your family suck. But it wouldn't ruin your life. You reporting this could in fact ruin hers. I would encourage you to make an appointment to sit down with her and tell her just how badly she screwed up, and how angry and betrayed it's made you feel. You could also tell her to EDUCATE her best friend on the realities of ADHD. And then, because it's sometimes hard to get signed up with a new doctor, tell her she has to do whatever is necessary to persuade the doctor of your choice to take you on - because of course you need a new doctor.", "NTA..... but right now the threat of reporting is the only leverage you have over your sister, if you do the report then you have nothing.\n\nIf it was me I'd tell my sister that if she tells anyone in the family you will report your friend, then it's in her hands. Sounds like it'll happen eventually, so this will just delay the reporting.\n\nThen I'd get some therapy, come to terms with your condition and work towards a place where their ill-informed opinions won't impact you as much.", "You're NTA for wanting to do it.\nIt sounded like you haven't yet confronted her about it. Since she's not only your GP, but also a family friend, I think you should give her a chance to explain herself and offer some way forward. For example this could work differently for her if she reported herself or she could find some way to make amends to you.\n\nYour sister needs to stop pushing you on this, she's being quite the asshole towards you. If she wants to help, she should tell her friend that you know and that she needs to start fixing the issue.", "NTA. I still follow HIPAA when talking about kids I worked with as a medical professional, because not only is it super important, but also so completely ingrained that it would just feel unnatural to me to refer to them by something other than a codename or as 'a kid I worked with.' If she did this with your information, I'm guessing this isn't an isolated incident for her. Violating HIPAA is no small thing.", "I do want to say as a fellow ADHDr please don\u2019t let it cause you to question your achievements, you deserve all you\u2019ve accomplished and if your family thinks otherwise they are so wrong.

There\u2019s some stigma around those drugs and she is just adding to it, it was an ignorant thing to say", "You are not the ahole but obviously naive.

You might have expected confidentiality yet this happened anyway, one can never be too careful. \n\nViolation aside, how the hell does your family not believe in ADHD and yet has a close friend who works with them? Wouldn't the doctor who treats such patients be considered as doing something useless and is prescribing drugs to people who don't need it and only suffer from laziness?

Taking medication you need is nothing to be ashamed of.  \nI hope you're okay", ">I expect that no matter what you do, your sister will eventually let the rest of the family know.\n\nI think the OP should use *not* reporting on the doctor friend as leverage to shut the sister's mouth. Surely that is the priority at the moment rather than exacting punishment.\n\nThe doctor should know that they have a sword of Damocles hanging over them. That is a kind of punishment in itself. Of course the doctor was in the wrong, but this course of action offers a choice between letting it go and ruining the doctor's life.\n\nIf OP decides that punishment is more important of course they have a right to report, but pragmatically speaking, conditionally not reporting might offer the best results.", "I would add:\nThe responsible thing for the doc to do would be to tell you what happened.

What do you think is the appropriate course of action for OP to take?", "Yep if the doctor had taken confidentiality as absolutely seriously as she should, she wouldn\u2019t have said anything to the sister.\n\nIf the sister had any sense at all and was worried about her friend, she would have not told a soul what she knew.  If she doesn\u2019t get that now,\nthen chances are she\u2019ll tell other family members at some point.", "Agreed, but it was the doctor's responsibility to say \"this is a conflict of interest and I can't see you.\"", "No, I think it's perfectly plausible it came from the doctor, though snooping could explain it, too!\n\nI can mostly see it coming up like this very easily:\n\n***conversation turns to anything related to mental health diagnoses, or someone makes an incredibly common comment or joke in the vein of \"hurr hurr, I must have ADHD/Autism/OCD/BPD/etc because I do this one quirky thing hurr hurr\"*** **(I really loath those types of ableist \"jokes\" so much)**\n\n\nSister jokingly says *\"Yeah, maybe I should pretend I'm mentally ill like everyone else does nowadays, so I can get those pills that pep you up!

I could prescribe you some Vyvanse, like your sister takes for her ADHD...\"*\n\nI see it coming up this way easily, especially when a group is drinking, and OP's sister has the toxic beliefs that mental illnesses aren't real, and that only lazy people who don't want to \"overcome thier faults\" would take medication for them. I've witnessed multiple conversations that went a similar way. A lot of folks also have trouble recalling medication names.", "If I'm partying the last thing on my mind is my patients. I don't drink tbh but the point is it wouldn't even cross my mind. This is a total betrayal of the worst kind. \nNTA and get some advice about how to proceed further.
