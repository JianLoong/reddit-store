Initially my doctor (Dr A) was a colleague of hers from the same clinic but after my doctor (Dr A) was away on maternity leave, I temporarily switched to my sister\u2019s friend (Dr B) as my primary physician and it\u2019s been that way since the pandemic began and I never switched back. \n\nI have ADHD and get prescription meds for it and have been for a few years now - something I haven\u2019t shared with any of my family members for fear of backlash since I come from a long line of type A over achievers who don\u2019t \u201cbelieve in ADHD\u201d and write it off as laziness. \n\nA few days ago, my siblings and I were hanging out at my sisters house watching the Matthew Perry - Diane Sawyer episode where he shares his history with substance about and I made a comment about how skinny he looked during one of the seasons of Friends. My sister then, out of nowhere, says to me, \u201cwell it started with prescription drugs so I hope you don\u2019t get hooked!\u201d I was instantly gripped with a feeling of absolute horror. My other siblings were confused and looking at her for further clarification but she didn\u2019t say anything more. I spent the whole night just frozen and with a deep pit in my stomach. \n\nLater, when I found some time alone with her, I had to pry the information out of her. She had just gotten back from a girls ski trip and when they were extremely drunk, her friend (my Dr B) slipped up and mentioned that she saw me recently for an increase in my dosage and basically revealed to my sister that I have been taking prescription vyvanse for a few years now. I\u2019m so livid, feel utter betrayal and have a strong urge to report her for breaking HIPAA regulations. \n\nMy sister won\u2019t stop texting and calling me about it, literally all day long, begging me not to ruin her friend\u2019s life forever after years of hard work. She\u2019s obviously worried about losing her friend but she couldn\u2019t care less about how disrespected I feel and how my privacy was violated. And more than anything, I worry that my sister will share it with my parents and my family will never look at me or my achievements the same.\n\n\n\n\nETA: A little more info. I\u2019ve known Dr B my entire life, as long as my sister has - she was my sister\u2019s friend since they were in first grade and they\u2019ve remained close and we\u2019ve hung out with our families on multiples occasions over the years. We\u2019ve even gone on trips together including my sister\u2019s bachelorette. I always looked up to her and found her cool growing up. She and my sister both have kids around the same age and they\u2019re close as well. She currently brings in the bigger chunk of the income in their family and they rely on it and my sister keeps reminding me that I\u2019m also ruining two innocent children\u2019s lives in the process, which is the only thing I feel guilt about. I adore those kids and they don\u2019t deserve that. But I also cannot get over how betrayed I feel. I always keep a safe distance between personal and professional relationships and would\u2019ve never picked her to be my doctor had the circumstances not unfolded the way it did. She was the next best doctor and was the obvious choice because I wasn\u2019t really looking to switch to a new clinic during the pandemic.", "created_utc": 1671222561, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zno8vv/aita_for_wanting_to_report_my_doctor_who_also/", "score": 355, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I didnt even know my sister was seeing her.\"", "NTA for wanting to report her.  But since you say she is a lifelong friend, i think you should give her an opportunity to explain things from her perspective,  and most importantly, allow her an opportunity to make things right in with you  in some way. Maybe not charging you for dr visits, i dont know but if she truly revealed this to your sister, as you noted that is a major hippa violation and she could possibly lose her license.  Maybe she deserves to.\n\nBut it is always possible that things didnt go down exactly in the way your sister said. Iam at a loss to understand how she could've gotten this information otherwise.\n \nBut when you discuss with her, if you start by saying you believe she has violated HIPPA  that should get her attention.\n\nLastly, unless you recorded your sister saying that your doctor discussed your office visit and medications with her, im not sure reporting it will accomplish anything because if your doctor denies she discussed your private medical information, you dont have any proof otherwise. So you may want to discuss with your sister again, but not like you are upset, just casually bring it up again, (while recording her) and say something like you had alot going on at the time she mentioned it before, but could she refresh your memory again on how she knew about your  health information.\n\nOne other thought if your doctor is in a group or in a partnership with other doctors, her discussing your health information is a risk to them as well and most physician's have insurance to cover them in case someone sues them for things of this nature.  \n\nI used to work in hospitals as a chief information officer so i am very familiar with the ramifications of physicians, nurses and other staff not keeping patients' health info private. This is a very very serious offense.  Im seen doctors & staff fired for things like you have described.  Ive also seen patients sue doctors for violating their privacy.

It might make more sense for you to sit down with sister and tell her if she ever mentions your medication again or even alludes to it, you'll report her friend, and tell the friend that if she steps a single toe out of line, you'll report her.  \n\nThen switch docs.

This means they aren't allowed to get a digital file on me. They have to run a paper file.\n\nThe doc didn't read the declaration, since most people just sign, and then found out when her boss checked my file and found the thing. I could actually sue the hospital for up to 10k or so if I wanted, as a sidenote, because this isn't something European Union's law will joke about!\n\nThe doc called me and was all scared, and I told her it's fine if she writes the summary of my case, and then deletes everything. It's highly unlikely my mother will check the pregnancy ward files without a hint - which also would be a violation of privacy, and I would absolutely sue her, and the hospital, if I ever caught on.\n\nThe doc was mortified as she heard the reason I wanted my data out of the system. It never occurred to her a staff member could abuse the intranet like that. She promised to get my data deleted.\n\nStill waiting on this summary.

With a case like this, Will take the case pro bono.", "Holy shit, NTA at all, report her right now! \n\nShe chose between alcohol and all the risks that came with it, or protecting her patient\u2019s privacy, and she made the wrong choice. \n\nChange your doctor and maybe change sisters while you\u2019re at it bc she doesn\u2019t seem to put you (HER SISTER) before her. None of this story is remotely okay. I hope you get through this as smooth as possible for your sake!", "NTA report her and I\u2019d leave a review on the place she works and say exactly what happened", "NTA. You were clearly violated, and your sister is defending that? Report the doc", "NTA - burn that HIPAA ignoring SOB to the ground.", "If you report the doctor, be prepared for your sister to spill the beans to the rest of your family.", "Your sister's friend committed a fairly major breach of HIPAA and didn't immediately inform you or inform her work place. That's bad. \n\nBut it's only one act of a breach of confidentiality and she can argue that she has taken steps to correct the problem (eg. Not getting drunk with your sister any more) so this probably won't ruin her life, if she's even found to be guilty of a HIPAA breach, which she probably won't be given that it will be your word against hers and I suspect your sister won't exactly support you. \n\nWhat reporting her might do though is get a note in her employment and force her to think twice before she stabs someone else in the back. NTA.", "Nta. You don't have to forgive this or let it go. You need to report it", "NTA. She should be reported. I\u2019m a PA & I\u2019d never ever reveal this; I\u2019m appalled that she did.  \n\nIt takes a LOT to be fired & she\u2019ll probably be fined or something light.  Maybe there will be an investigation that reveals she\u2019s been unprofessional before.  \n\nPlease report her.", "NTA\n\nConfidentiality is a cornerstone of professionalism and professional ethics. Her actions are inexcusable. Please make a report.", "NTA\n\nThe basic level of medical care should be privacy. She got drunk and stupid and then didn\u2019t have the maturity or composure to speak to you about her slip.\n\nAlcohol is no excuse for sharing private medical information to anyone.\n\nYou NEED to report her before she continues to do this to others.", "NTA. But def prepare for your sister to tell ypur family. Especially if you file a complaint, which you 100000% should. Her friend and her both messed up, this is serious anywhere because those rules are in place for a reason. I'd be filing the complaint and blocking my sister. You didn't ruin anyone's life, they ruined their lives by not following the rules of their profession.", "I would make a deal with your sister.  She keeps her mouth shut to your family and you will let this go.  I realise everyone is telling you to report her but the risk is your sister going off the deep end and telling your family information you don't want them to know.  After all, if her friend is reported then there is a chance that this will come out anyway.\n\nNTA.", "NTA", "NTA, you should definitely report her, if not for yourself for the sake of anyone else who might have to deal with her. If she told your sister drunk or sober about your private info, I could only imagine what else she's let slip past her mouth.\n\nAnd if she's told your sister about that stuff while drunk, she's probably told her some more stuff while sober.", "NTA\n\nI work in healthcare.  My best friend is a doctor.  Honestly, we share weird medical shit we see at work ALL the time with each other (we work at different institutions).  We do NOT share any identifying information about the patient and your doctor was WAY out of line sharing any information about you to any family without your express, written permission.\n\nEven with that massive screw up, your sister could have avoided her friend getting reported by keeping that information to herself.  I happen to know quite a few unpleasant secrets about current coworkers, but no one is going to hear any of them from me because I know how to keep my mouth shut, even while drinking, and especially not as a snide remark in front of an audience!\n\nReport your doctor.", "My best friend since childhood recently started working for a great hospice place across the country. She visited and told me all about experiences at work and left out any kind of details that violate HIPPA at all. \n\nKeep in mind we\u2019re across the country and her job is being with patients before they pass, so everybody whose identity my friends was protecting, is likely dead. She still showed them more respect than your sisters friend showed you. NTA", "NTA\n\nFile a complaint. She\u2019s not going to have her life and career destroyed, especially not if she\u2019s never had an infraction before. She does need a warning in her life and probably some training. Also you should consult a lawyer because you may be entitled to financial compensation depending on where you live.", "NTA and report her as fast as you can. HIPAA is in place for a reason, and the rules apply no matter what situation the professional is in. Do NOT take this lightly.", "NTA; being friends with someone doesn't excuse a HIPAA violation", "NTA- I would love to say, burn the doc. However, that will almost certainly get your sister to tell your whole family what she knows. You might consider not reporting if sis swears to keep the secret. And, of course, you want to find a new doc.", "Nta, report the doctor. \n\nI work in Healthcare records in the US. Your sister is being ridiculously dramatic about the level of trouble her friend will be in unless this is a reoccurring issue, then the friend shouldn't be practicing anyways.\n\nThe bigger issue is your sister talking about you. And repeating something she KNEW was privileged info. I would sit down with your sister and the Dr. Together, explain that they both fucked up and they need to learn from their mistakes like grown ass adults. Actions have consequences \n\nIf your family discounts your accomplishments just because you are using the right accommodation (just like someone with a broken foot would never be questioned why crutches are needed) then you should go low contact and let them miss you.", "NTA.\n\nYour doctor violated your privacy. AND did it in a way she could have reasonably known would be problematic (she knows your whole family).\n\nYou might remind your sister that you might never have found out if SHE (your sister) had been able to refrain from taking a dig at you.", "NTA\n\nThese are important rules that are in place for a reason. If she looses her job then it's on her, she knows the rules, this isn't a surprise. It is also your sisters fault, if she kept her mouth shut you wouldn't have known, and there would be no reason for you to make a complaint.", "What you should do is call the health system and ask for the HIPAA Privacy Officer.  Make the complaint.  Tell them everything you said here.  This is a reportable breach, and they should bend over backwards to resolve this.  She may not lose her job, but she will be in big trouble.  Please do it.", "NTA. Op needs to keep receipts of the texts.", "Ok so here is what I would do..I would get BOTH DR B and Your sister in a room and I would say I will NOT report this on these conditions #1 DR B. You have to promise that you aren\u2019t gonna cut me off my meds EVER and #2you are going to explain right now to my sister that ADHD IS A REAL THING #3 sister you are gonna keep this PRIVATE FOREVER IF ANYONE ELSE FINDS OUT IM PUTTING IN THE COMPLAINT! This may be some jacked up thinking on my part but over here in the US it is NOT EASY to get those meds anymore you have to go through a psychiatrist now to get them so I\u2019m just like wow I would give anything to have this kinda power in my hands so I could easily get my ADHD MEDS and never fear they will just cut me off one day\u2026it happens here ALL THE TIME", "RN here: not even trashed have I violated my country's version of hippa that badly (everyone slips up here and there, but my professional/personal lives are so disconnected I could honestly openly discuss stuff with no risk).\n\nThat said, I think a slip like that is unlikely to cause her to lose her job. Disciplinary action is more likely, maybe a temporary restriction on her licence.\n\nSo you? NTA. I would actually encourage you to report", "NTA,\n\nBut I cannot help feeling that this would not have happened if the relationships were all so close.\n\nI think your sister is the bigger A, she received the private info erroneously and instead of keeping it quiet or saying \"You shouldn't have told me that\" \nShe blabs it to you publicly.\nYea yea your doctor was wrong, and if you want to go ahead and seek retribution then have at it......\n.\nPersonally, I would request a letter of apology from her,  (a good one)..... Citing her bad choices and that you will be moving doctors etc,\n\nI would further state that if her best friend (your sister) tells ANYONE, then you will commence with official complaints.\n\nThis now puts the pressure on her to make sure your sister keeps her mouth shut.\n\nMy 0.02c", "NTA this needs to be reported because you\u2019re probably not the only patient she\u2019s using for gossip!", "NTA. You should report her.  Who knows what other private information she's shared about other people?\n\nShe's a doctor. She knows how important it is to not \"let things slip\", ESPECIALLY to people like the family of her patients.\n\nAlso, your sister sounds like a jerk.", "NTA but right now you have amo, something to keep your sister in line, she blabs about your meds you report the best friend. I would make sure they both know that if you hear so much as a peep from anyone about this you will file the complaint. If you just go ahead and report right now I feel very certain your sister will tell everyone about your medication.", "NTA. \n\nBUT being as this Dr. B is basically family to you, that is a huge conflict of interest. You said you try to keep your personal life and professional life separate but clearly not in this case. I would definitely be changing doctors even if that meant changing clinics, and also I'd be having a very serious conversation with Dr. B about privacy and confidentiality.", "NTA.\n\nAs I read it what the Dr. did was not okay. What your sister did was definitely not okay. In my opinion if I was you, I would seriously reconsider my relationship with your sister and change Dr.\n\nI'm not sure I would report it tbh, I think it will be punishment enough (and maybe even more) having that hang over your sisters head. Sure, the Dr. might deserve it, but do you need the drama? It sucks that people know about your prescription, I can understand it really, really do, but potentially ruining the Dr.s life for that? You could tell her how utterly unprofessional it is instead, and how she should feel very lucky that you don't report it: That would be a lesson for a lifetime I imagine.\n\nI think you might get a better outcome for everyone involved this way: Grandstanding isn't always the best thing to do, even if you're in the right.", "There\u2019s a double betrayal here too.  It\u2019s not just that Dr. B said something. That\u2019s horrific enough. But then the sister had the gall to mention it in front of others and use it agains OP and then act like OP would be horrible if she reported it.", "Have you considered that maybe your sister lost her friend the job? She\u2019s decided that getting one up on you is more important than letting her friends violation go unnoticed. She could have kept quiet and you\u2019d never have known or have reason to complain", "Everybody and anybody who uses alcohol as an excuse for bad behavior of any kind can go straight to hell.", "[removed]", "If you have access to sensitive information and can't keep your mouth shut when drunk, maybe that's a you problem, and it warrants being reported rather than covered up and silenced.\n\nThe information this woman \"let slip\" too, the name of the medication, the dosage? What the fuck. What else, what OP said during *confidential* conversations?\n\nI believe this woman has \"let slip\" patient information plenty of times before (drunk or not, I don't fucking buy it), it just so happens that OP was the patient in question *this* time.", "> no matter how drunk you get.\n\nScrew statement like this that imply alcohol use should *ever* be treated as a mitigating factor in things.", "This. If its a once off she's not going to be deregistered for it or anything that dramatic and maybe it will teach her to be better.", ">How does, \"Hey, I just saw your sister to increase her dosage of prescription vyvanse\" just come up in conversation?\n\nMy guess?\n\nSister: These ADHD people, it's all just laziness\n\nDr: I don't think that's true. You don't think your sister is lazy do you?", "Good advice", "Here I would risk the possibility of my family finding out, if I could cope with it. This might happen again with someone who can't cope with it, therefore, the Dr. should be reported ASAP.\n\nIf I was OP ofc.", "Yup.  No one would ever have known about the drunken slip (which is its own huge problem) if the sister hadn't been a twit.\n\nI was helping my mom clear out some of my sister's old stuff (she lives out of stuff) and in clearing out old bday cards, random awards from middle school (my sister has given me full reign over what I think she'll want or not) I found a letter that revealed a really intense secret from her early 20s.  For me it only inspired empathy for what she'd dealt with at that age.  For my mom,  my sister's choices would fundamentally change their already strained relationship. My sister would be hugely embarrassed if she found out I knew.\n\nThe letter went into my pocket, to be thrown away in my house where my parents would never see it.  The fact that I know this information will go with me to my grave because... why would I do anything else with it?  It was an accidental discovery and it was never my business.", "This is it right there. Both are to blame.  Dr most of all, but yeah sis is STUPID for repeating. She could have just kept her mouth shut.", "100%. They're cowards. I've done stupid shit drunk. Guess what? It was my fault, not the alcohol. Anyone that even tries that excuse with me is telling me that they aren't the kinds of people I want to be around whatsoever. \n\nI'm sick of that stupid cop out excuse.", "/u/Patient_Primary_652 is a comment stealing bot.
