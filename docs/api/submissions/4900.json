Initially my doctor (Dr A) was a colleague of hers from the same clinic but after my doctor (Dr A) was away on maternity leave, I temporarily switched to my sister\u2019s friend (Dr B) as my primary physician and it\u2019s been that way since the pandemic began and I never switched back. \n\nI have ADHD and get prescription meds for it and have been for a few years now - something I haven\u2019t shared with any of my family members for fear of backlash since I come from a long line of type A over achievers who don\u2019t \u201cbelieve in ADHD\u201d and write it off as laziness. \n\nA few days ago, my siblings and I were hanging out at my sisters house watching the Matthew Perry - Diane Sawyer episode where he shares his history with substance about and I made a comment about how skinny he looked during one of the seasons of Friends. My sister then, out of nowhere, says to me, \u201cwell it started with prescription drugs so I hope you don\u2019t get hooked!\u201d I was instantly gripped with a feeling of absolute horror. My other siblings were confused and looking at her for further clarification but she didn\u2019t say anything more. I spent the whole night just frozen and with a deep pit in my stomach. \n\nLater, when I found some time alone with her, I had to pry the information out of her. She had just gotten back from a girls ski trip and when they were extremely drunk, her friend (my Dr B) slipped up and mentioned that she saw me recently for an increase in my dosage and basically revealed to my sister that I have been taking prescription vyvanse for a few years now. I\u2019m so livid, feel utter betrayal and have a strong urge to report her for breaking HIPAA regulations. \n\nMy sister won\u2019t stop texting and calling me about it, literally all day long, begging me not to ruin her friend\u2019s life forever after years of hard work. She\u2019s obviously worried about losing her friend but she couldn\u2019t care less about how disrespected I feel and how my privacy was violated. And more than anything, I worry that my sister will share it with my parents and my family will never look at me or my achievements the same.\n\n\n\n\nETA: A little more info. I\u2019ve known Dr B my entire life, as long as my sister has - she was my sister\u2019s friend since they were in first grade and they\u2019ve remained close and we\u2019ve hung out with our families on multiples occasions over the years. We\u2019ve even gone on trips together including my sister\u2019s bachelorette. I always looked up to her and found her cool growing up. She and my sister both have kids around the same age and they\u2019re close as well. She currently brings in the bigger chunk of the income in their family and they rely on it and my sister keeps reminding me that I\u2019m also ruining two innocent children\u2019s lives in the process, which is the only thing I feel guilt about. I adore those kids and they don\u2019t deserve that. But I also cannot get over how betrayed I feel. I always keep a safe distance between personal and professional relationships and would\u2019ve never picked her to be my doctor had the circumstances not unfolded the way it did. She was the next best doctor and was the obvious choice because I wasn\u2019t really looking to switch to a new clinic during the pandemic.", "created_utc": 1671222561, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zno8vv/aita_for_wanting_to_report_my_doctor_who_also/", "score": 121, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To be clear, needing/taking medication is not a flaw, and Dr B is the one primarily responsible. But while you will wear no true blame for reporting her, your sister is *feeling* blame and guilt because she's the one who broke confidence to your face.

Then the sister, when not drunk, blurts out your sensitive information. I'm very sure the friend when she became sober begged the sister to never  mention this. But she couldn't hold it. Because she's a gossip. This does not bode well for you that she's going to keep your secret. I agree with other posters about that. She will either slip intentionally or unintentionally as she has a problem drunk or sober with keeping confidences. If you don't want to report her to the state board then at the very least you should do is report her to the practice itself. She at least deserves to lose her job for this.

You definitely should report it. If she is incapable of keeping her mouth shut, whose to say whether she has broken privacy law regarding other patients aside from you?

It may be their word against yours. \"No, my friend is a great doctor, and has never disclosed any of my sisters health information to me. I didnt even know my sister was seeing her.\"", "NTA for wanting to report her.  But since you say she is a lifelong friend, i think you should give her an opportunity to explain things from her perspective,  and most importantly, allow her an opportunity to make things right in with you  in some way. Maybe not charging you for dr visits, i dont know but if she truly revealed this to your sister, as you noted that is a major hippa violation and she could possibly lose her license.  Maybe she deserves to.\n\nBut it is always possible that things didnt go down exactly in the way your sister said. Iam at a loss to understand how she could've gotten this information otherwise.\n \nBut when you discuss with her, if you start by saying you believe she has violated HIPPA  that should get her attention.\n\nLastly, unless you recorded your sister saying that your doctor discussed your office visit and medications with her, im not sure reporting it will accomplish anything because if your doctor denies she discussed your private medical information, you dont have any proof otherwise. So you may want to discuss with your sister again, but not like you are upset, just casually bring it up again, (while recording her) and say something like you had alot going on at the time she mentioned it before, but could she refresh your memory again on how she knew about your  health information.\n\nOne other thought if your doctor is in a group or in a partnership with other doctors, her discussing your health information is a risk to them as well and most physician's have insurance to cover them in case someone sues them for things of this nature.  \n\nI used to work in hospitals as a chief information officer so i am very familiar with the ramifications of physicians, nurses and other staff not keeping patients' health info private. This is a very very serious offense.  Im seen doctors & staff fired for things like you have described.  Ive also seen patients sue doctors for violating their privacy.

It might make more sense for you to sit down with sister and tell her if she ever mentions your medication again or even alludes to it, you'll report her friend, and tell the friend that if she steps a single toe out of line, you'll report her.  \n\nThen switch docs.

This means they aren't allowed to get a digital file on me. They have to run a paper file.\n\nThe doc didn't read the declaration, since most people just sign, and then found out when her boss checked my file and found the thing. I could actually sue the hospital for up to 10k or so if I wanted, as a sidenote, because this isn't something European Union's law will joke about!\n\nThe doc called me and was all scared, and I told her it's fine if she writes the summary of my case, and then deletes everything. It's highly unlikely my mother will check the pregnancy ward files without a hint - which also would be a violation of privacy, and I would absolutely sue her, and the hospital, if I ever caught on.\n\nThe doc was mortified as she heard the reason I wanted my data out of the system. It never occurred to her a staff member could abuse the intranet like that. She promised to get my data deleted.\n\nStill waiting on this summary. I will send a request on what personal data they have about me in January, just to be sure they deleted everything.
