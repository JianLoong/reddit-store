She had just gotten back from a girls ski trip and when they were extremely drunk, her friend (my Dr B) slipped up and mentioned that she saw me recently for an increase in my dosage and basically revealed to my sister that I have been taking prescription vyvanse for a few years now. I\u2019m so livid, feel utter betrayal and have a strong urge to report her for breaking HIPAA regulations. \n\nMy sister won\u2019t stop texting and calling me about it, literally all day long, begging me not to ruin her friend\u2019s life forever after years of hard work.

I\u2019ve known Dr B my entire life, as long as my sister has - she was my sister\u2019s friend since they were in first grade and they\u2019ve remained close and we\u2019ve hung out with our families on multiples occasions over the years. We\u2019ve even gone on trips together including my sister\u2019s bachelorette. I always looked up to her and found her cool growing up. She and my sister both have kids around the same age and they\u2019re close as well. She currently brings in the bigger chunk of the income in their family and they rely on it and my sister keeps reminding me that I\u2019m also ruining two innocent children\u2019s lives in the process, which is the only thing I feel guilt about. I adore those kids and they don\u2019t deserve that. But I also cannot get over how betrayed I feel. I always keep a safe distance between personal and professional relationships and would\u2019ve never picked her to be my doctor had the circumstances not unfolded the way it did.

But since you say she is a lifelong friend, i think you should give her an opportunity to explain things from her perspective,  and most importantly, allow her an opportunity to make things right in with you  in some way. Maybe not charging you for dr visits, i dont know but if she truly revealed this to your sister, as you noted that is a major hippa violation and she could possibly lose her license.  Maybe she deserves to.\n\nBut it is always possible that things didnt go down exactly in the way your sister said. Iam at a loss to understand how she could've gotten this information otherwise.\n \nBut when you discuss with her, if you start by saying you believe she has violated HIPPA  that should get her attention.\n\nLastly, unless you recorded your sister saying that your doctor discussed your office visit and medications with her, im not sure reporting it will accomplish anything because if your doctor denies she discussed your private medical information, you dont have any proof otherwise. So you may want to discuss with your sister again, but not like you are upset, just casually bring it up again, (while recording her) and say something like you had alot going on at the time she mentioned it before, but could she refresh your memory again on how she knew about your  health information.\n\nOne other thought if your doctor is in a group or in a partnership with other doctors, her discussing your health information is a risk to them as well and most physician's have insurance to cover them in case someone sues them for things of this nature.  \n\nI used to work in hospitals as a chief information officer so i am very familiar with the ramifications of physicians, nurses and other staff not keeping patients' health info private. This is a very very serious offense.  Im seen doctors & staff fired for things like you have described.  Ive also seen patients sue doctors for violating their privacy.

It might make more sense for you to sit down with sister and tell her if she ever mentions your medication again or even alludes to it, you'll report her friend, and tell the friend that if she steps a single toe out of line, you'll report her.  \n\nThen switch docs.

This means they aren't allowed to get a digital file on me. They have to run a paper file.\n\nThe doc didn't read the declaration, since most people just sign, and then found out when her boss checked my file and found the thing. I could actually sue the hospital for up to 10k or so if I wanted, as a sidenote, because this isn't something European Union's law will joke about!\n\nThe doc called me and was all scared, and I told her it's fine if she writes the summary of my case, and then deletes everything. It's highly unlikely my mother will check the pregnancy ward files without a hint - which also would be a violation of privacy, and I would absolutely sue her, and the hospital, if I ever caught on.\n\nThe doc was mortified as she heard the reason I wanted my data out of the system. It never occurred to her a staff member could abuse the intranet like that. She promised to get my data deleted.\n\nStill waiting on this summary.

If this is the only time she's done this at worst it will be a reprimand and maybe a small fine if you complain to the medical board.  Your sister will be angry with you and you'll need to find a new doctor. Perhaps start with complaining to your doctor about what happened.  Does she even remember sharing the info? A sincere apology might help you with your feelings of betrayal.  Good Luck!", "NTA. This doctor violated your privacy in a major way, and HIPAA exists for a reason. She needs to be reported.", "NTA. Report her. It\u2019s her fault. They shouldn\u2019t have been discussing your medical history.

Not only she got hold of private information, but she knew that mentioning that to you would expose her (supposedly) best friend who may lose her license because of this. Also, your sister realized you had a medical condition, but instead of showing compassion, she decided to embarrass you in front of your family. What would have happened had Dr. B not been her friend and she figured it out on her own? Would she humiliate you some more or even blackmail you? The sister knew her friend made a mistake while drunk, but she still decided to use it as a weapon. \n\nSo, if you report Dr. B to Hyppa and she loses her licenses, it\u2019s on your sister and the doctor, not you.\n\nAlso, I wonder what kind of conversations did the two of them have during the trip. One doesn\u2019t just bring up someone\u2019s sister\u2019s medical condition. There is a good chance Dr. B slips like that more often, and even if she doesn\u2019t mention the names of patients, that\u2019s still unethical. Why were they even discussing you?

Who knows what else she will share the next time she gets drunk?  \n\nYour sister and her friend are both TAs here.  You're not ruining her friend's life.  Her friend did that.  Also, one report of a HIPAA violation won't result in her losing her medical license or privileges.  Multiple ones might, but by that point it would be an ongoing problem, not down to your single complaint.  Having to face the consequences of her actions might be what she needs to make her realize she has really lousy ethics.\n\nChange doctors.  After all, she's proven she's not trustworthy.
