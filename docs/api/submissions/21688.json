This woman\u2019s reaction is completely unhinged. You made a simple request and she threw a tantrum like a child. You didn\u2019t yell at her to stop. You didn\u2019t shame her. You just asked her to chew with her mouth closed.", "I know plenty of people from China - Hong Kong and the mainland. None of them chew with their mouths open. This is not a cultural thing it\u2019s a bad manners thing. If she cares about not appearing crass and ill mannered she\u2019ll learn to keep her mouth closed while chewing. It isn\u2019t that hard to do. NTA.", "If all you did was ask her to chew with her mouth closed there's no scenario where you could possibly be in the wrong. People ask other people for things all the time, so as long as you weren't judgmental about it there's no problem. Idk where people are getting your rudeness from at all because you don't even sound rude describing it here. There is no universe in which storming off at a question like that is acceptable in any way either.", "Nta if someone is eating with their mouth open I wouldn\u2019t be able to eat with them. It\u2019s gross and I have a sensitivity to eating noises.", "You should have addressed it with your father first. He could have told you then that it is cultural. You embarrassed and shamed this woman. You weren't an AH, but you owe this woman a sincere apology.

It's also the sole reason I stopped watching Man v. Food - Casey talks with his mouth full, disgusting to watch.", "NTA - as someone with misophonia the sound of chewing really sets me off. You should not have to deal with something that makes you uncomfortable. That being said, tell your dad that so long as you\u2019re uncomfortable you\u2019d like to not hang around them, as it\u2019ll just make things worse. \n\nYes, culturally there are some norms that are considered polite but obviously this makes you uncomfortable, so you should not have to be subjected to being around those triggers.", "YTA - Although I agree that its gross, you couldve been more polite about it and/or told her in private so it didnt embarass her", "YTA. \n\nThere is a better way to approach that subject. There are some people that literally cannot help themselves when they eat. It could be a medical issue and you could have just made her feel incredibly bad about it. \n\nApologize.", "ATA\n\nYou should have taken a more sensitive approach to this subject. She clearly didn\u2019t know, and it hurt her feelings. You should have spoken with your dad about it first.", "Yes you are TA. Different cultures, different strokes for different folks, it was rude to do it in front of others. If it bothered you so much you should have talked in private to her.", "YTA. Your father\u2019s girlfriend was a guest in his home and it was rude of you to correct her. You owe both of them an apology for your behavior.", "YTA. Yes, it's cultural. You are obviously young enough to still be living with your mother and visiting your father half the summer -- you do not, ever, teach a 50-year-old adult table manners. In fact, presuming to teach anyone but your own children any kind of manners is extremely rude in pretty much any culture. This is how we know rude people: they don't hesitate to instruct others how to behave.", "YTA. My friend and her husband had this argument over, and over, and over again. He would chew with his mouth closed for a few bites and the back to \u201cchomping \u201c again. She thought he was doing it to be lazy. Turns out the man has sinus problems and can barely breathe through his nose. THE MAN COULD NOT BREATHE. But \u201cOh no. He knows he\u2019s driving me crazy, he just doesn\u2019t care\u201d. O\n\nI was happily for him when he left her\n\nI\u2019m glad she\u2019s no more than an acquaintance now.   \n\n\nGet over yourself \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA", "NTA but next time assert dominance and do the same thing while coughing and staring into her soul", "NTA. I thought people grew out of that. Sheesh", "\u201cSlurping, smacking the lips and leaving the mouth open when eating can be viewed as demonstrating enjoyment of the food and a friendly atmosphere in China.\u201d- This is important info for anyone making judgments to be aware of. \n\nI may notice someone has poor manners and be internally bothered by it. I would never, *ever* comment on it. No, OP wasn\u2019t \u201cshaming\u201d her, but, I don\u2019t think he needed to be for it to still be embarrassing. He could have spoken to his dad, quietly, and privately, and asked him to speak to his girlfriend about this. He himself could have gone to the girlfriend and privately asked her. He chose not to do so, and instead very publicly asked her to essentially correct her manners. And that *is* extremely rude. He put her on the spot, and while her reaction wasn\u2019t appropriate, I can understand exactly why she was feeling embarrassed. \n\nThere is a such thing as having social graces when interacting with other people. OP seems to have forgotten his in this interaction. Part of having good manners means not openly and publicly criticizing or correcting people. \n\nAlso. And I know this will be an unpopular opinion, but I don\u2019t care. It IS possible to be bothered by something\u2026. and just deal with it. Did OP *really* have to correct her on this? Did he *really* have to say something? Probably not.\nThere are times when criticism is warranted, like when someone behaves in a way that is hurting you and you want to set a boundary. This really wasn\u2019t even something OP needed to discuss. When it comes to the people in your life, learn to be selective with what you criticize. \n\nESH.", "You don't understand Chinese culture either. Western culture is different. She embarrassed and shamed this woman.", "Well, one time, I watched a movie about China. So I\u2019m basically an expert now. \n\nThat\u2019s how stupid you sound acting like you knowing people from China makes you in any way qualified to speak with authority on the culture there. Especially when compared to someone who is literally from there.", "So you know people from China, this Chinese woman was raised in China. I don\u2019t think OP is TA bc they didn\u2019t push it or ask rudely, the gfs response was a big overreaction, but I don\u2019t think you have the authority over what\u2019s cultural. A quick google search will show you quite a lot of people, people from Asian countries included, wouldn\u2019t agree that it is not cultural.", "Didn't know that she chewed with her mouth open? I know I hurt her feelings but I don't understand why she was so upset about it.", "If it\u2019s cultural, shouldn\u2019t she make an effort at learning the culture where she lives and understand that some people find open-mouthed chewing to be disgusting and offensive?", "My dad asked her if she could stop chewing with her mouth open when they first started dating (I wasn't there, I was with mum) and she didn't like that.", "She? Also, she wasn't ashamed or embarrassed, she was only mad at me.", "Because at a minimum you told her she was rude and had no manners.  \n\nIn the worst case she interpreted it as an attack on her and her culture and was the equivalent of you telling her to go back to where she came from.\n\nSo you owe her an apology.\n\nI don\u2019t understand why you would ever tell someone to eat with their mouth closed over the age of 12", "I'm wondering how old you are?", "If you know you hurt her feelings, why don't you apologize and try to get to know her and her sauces. If you know you hurt her feelings and all you can talk about is how you don't understand what's the big deal, YTA. Focus on where *you* hurt someone's feelings, who didn't deserve it.", "Unless the OP edited their post between our responses you are 100% placing their judgment of them being rude and poorly mannered onto them. She's a grown ass woman; if she did interpret OP's question that way then that's her own problem. There is no logical connection between \"can you please chew with your mouth closed\" and \"go back to your own country.\" In some cultures chewing one way is wrong and it's reversed elsewhere. That's life and there's nothing wrong with questions like that being asked between their members.", "I'm Fourteen my good man."]}
