You are obviously young enough to still be living with your mother and visiting your father half the summer -- you do not, ever, teach a 50-year-old adult table manners.

Also, in many Asian cultures, respect of elders is extremely significant. OP is the son of her boyfriend, so for him to criticize her so openly, may have been seen as extremely disrespectful to her. When you welcome a new person into your family, the kind and respectful thing to do is to educate yourself on the culture that person is coming from. \n\nI may notice someone has poor manners and be internally bothered by it. I would never, *ever* comment on it. No, OP wasn\u2019t \u201cshaming\u201d her, but, I don\u2019t think he needed to be for it to still be embarrassing. He could have spoken to his dad, quietly, and privately, and asked him to speak to his girlfriend about this. He himself could have gone to the girlfriend and privately asked her. He chose not to do so, and instead very publicly asked her to essentially correct her manners. And that *is* extremely rude. He put her on the spot, and while her reaction wasn\u2019t appropriate, I can understand exactly why she was feeling embarrassed. Manners do go both ways. \n\nThere is a such thing as having social graces when interacting with other people. OP seems to have forgotten his in this interaction. Part of having good manners means not openly and publicly criticizing or correcting people. If you have to criticize someone you do it discreetly and in a way where they are as comfortable as possible. \n\nAlso. And I know this will be an unpopular opinion, but I don\u2019t care. It IS possible to be bothered by something\u2026. and just deal with it. Did OP *really* have to correct her on this? Did he *really* have to say something? Probably not.\nThere are times when criticism is warranted, like when someone behaves in a way that is hurting you and you want to set a boundary. This really wasn\u2019t even something OP needed to discuss. He could have just ignored it and coped for the times when this person visits. When it comes to the people in your life, learn to be selective with what you criticize. \n\nI don\u2019t think you had any malicious intentions OP. Just lacking in tact and social graces in this one scenario. Don\u2019t beat yourself up, but do learn from this.

So I don't take them off all the time in my own house to this day.  I realize for a lot of people, that's rude and even gross!  So you know what I do?  Whenever I walk into someone elses house, I look around. If they have shoes off, mine come off too.  I don't throw a tantrum and run out of the house and say \"but, but... it's not FAIR! I grew up with SHOES ON!!!

At first, we were confused, but then, of course, it was explained that leaving the last one was more or less a sign that nobody wanted it, which wasn't true.
