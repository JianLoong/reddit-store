You are obviously young enough to still be living with your mother and visiting your father half the summer -- you do not, ever, teach a 50-year-old adult table manners.

Also, in many Asian cultures, respect of elders is extremely significant. OP is the son of her boyfriend, so for him to criticize her so openly, may have been seen as extremely disrespectful to her. When you welcome a new person into your family, the kind and respectful thing to do is to educate yourself on the culture that person is coming from. \n\nI may notice someone has poor manners and be internally bothered by it. I would never, *ever* comment on it. No, OP wasn\u2019t \u201cshaming\u201d her, but, I don\u2019t think he needed to be for it to still be embarrassing. He could have spoken to his dad, quietly, and privately, and asked him to speak to his girlfriend about this. He himself could have gone to the girlfriend and privately asked her. He chose not to do so, and instead very publicly asked her to essentially correct her manners. And that *is* extremely rude. He put her on the spot, and while her reaction wasn\u2019t appropriate, I can understand exactly why she was feeling embarrassed. Manners do go both ways. \n\nThere is a such thing as having social graces when interacting with other people. OP seems to have forgotten his in this interaction. Part of having good manners means not openly and publicly criticizing or correcting people. \n\nAlso. And I know this will be an unpopular opinion, but I don\u2019t care. It IS possible to be bothered by something\u2026. and just deal with it. Did OP *really* have to correct her on this? Did he *really* have to say something? Probably not.\nThere are times when criticism is warranted, like when someone behaves in a way that is hurting you and you want to set a boundary. This really wasn\u2019t even something OP needed to discuss. He could have just ignored it and coped for the times when this person visits. When it comes to the people in your life, learn to be selective with what you criticize. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re malicious OP. Just lacking in tact and social graces.

So I don't take them off all the time in my own house to this day.  I realize for a lot of people, that's rude and even gross!  So you know what I do?  Whenever I walk into someone elses house, I look around. If they have shoes off, mine come off too.  I don't throw a tantrum and run out of the house and say \"but, but... it's not FAIR! I grew up with SHOES ON!!! You are SO RUDE to ask me to take them off!!!\"  I just take my shoes off and continue my life.  \n\nIf she had said \"I'm sorry, I've never had to do that before, but I'll do my best\" you'd both have been happy.

And misophonia comes with visual triggers for the audio triggers, so if I see the chewing and smacking the plugs would do no good anyway. It's considered rude by most people for me to look away and refuse to engage because I'm involuntarily twitching, trying not to cry, and trying not to throw up. It's also considered rude to get up and leave because people like OPs fathers GF would likely demand you stay and talk and get offended with you for trying to distance yourself. \n\nManaging this is not that easy. I also have a lot of social anxiety and managing that by talking through the issue would be far easier than sitting there in uncontrollable agony. As you stated, you're worried more for her social anxiety than someone's misophonia. So this isn't two wheelchairs, this is one wheelchair and someone with, say, the Eastern Asian culture of refusing to touch people because of germs and societal norms also refusing to help a person in a wheelchair, and watching them crawl, and throwing a tantrum when they ask for help because it's a different culture.\n\nBut you're right. All this is doing is making me mad because I'm remembering so many people like you who say that I'm being dramatic and not trying hard enough to ignore the sounds of food making me literally hurt and have an anxiety attack, and I'm taking it out on you because of the association. So I'll take a step back from here and refuse to engage further before I get madder. Have a good day.", "Oh my god, the virtue signaling you've spewed all over this post and condescension towards dissenting opinions is nauseating. Tone it down, dude.", "in norway chewing with your mouth open and smacking your lips and slurping are all considered rude and inconsiderate, as op said. commenting on the manners of others is never especially correct, but when you\u2019re visiting a family and eating with them it is not really unheard of to try to eat in a way they won\u2019t find disgusting. the dad commented, op commented, she is very rude to persist in this. no one is too old to learn to make the people around us feel comfortable. part of the joy of visiting other cultures is to enjoy them to the fullest, no? throwing a tantrum because someone tries to teach you their culture is absurd, imo.", "OP is being expected to tolerate disgusting table habits and keep silent about it, because the disgusting woman is an elder.  That sort of elder worship is a cultural tradition of China, not Norway.", "Good sir. I had no idea why she was mad, I said so in the post. And I also said in the comments you read that he told me this afterwards.", "Oh yeah, obviously saying he's unpleasant to be around wouldn't be the most tactful, but it's also fairly clearly the message behind the issue - it depends whether she'll get upset about that however I say it or if she'd appreciate the effort I put in to try and be more delicate, which you can't always predict. I fairly recently lost a friend for saying we don't want dogs around a new baby/new furniture/prey animal pets in their own home, and nothing I could say could overcome 'my dog is my baby and it's deeply offensive if you won't let her in your home', so establishing boundaries where I have different comfort levels to other people is a bit of a raw area.", "Sounds like this visit is just making their relationship worse instead of fostering anything.", "you replied to a comment that noted their experiences with chinese people and was just trying to clarify it wasn\u2019t a cultural thing and rather a bad manners thing (which i fully agree with), keep in mind this person is just justifying that the lady in the story was the AH because she can\u2019t just use her culture to justify her bad manners! you somehow found fault with this persons first hand experience, and decided you had the authority to say their experience was invalid. you guys both agree that the woman in the story is the asshole so you just felt the need to find something to disagree with i guess?.. if you\u2019re such a big advocate that chinese people talk with their mouths open i guess tho i won\u2019t stop you\ud83d\ude05", "you're a child. you're a minor. you're a kid. you should not be going around telling adults what to do. full stop. \n\nwho do you think you are?

If you need to essentially lie to prop up your argument, maybe that\u2019s a sign you should not be having that argument. Nowhere did I say anyone was stupid, perhaps I\u2019m making you *feel* stupid and you\u2019re projecting by saying this, but that\u2019s a separate issue. \n\n>I can't wear earplugs, they don't fit in my ears because the canals curve. \n\nNeither can I, hence why I invested in custom ones. Sure, I ate ramen for 2 weeks to do so, but,  it was a worthy expenditure to help my manage my disorder. Problem solve. \n\n>And misophonia comes with visual triggers for the audio triggers, so if I see the chewing and smacking the plugs would do no good anyway. \n\nWell, fortunately for you, you *can* control your eyes, and where you look. If you see a visual trigger, stop looking at it. This would also be part of what I consider taking responsibility for managing your own self. \n\n>It's considered rude by most people for me to look away and refuse to engage because I'm involuntarily twitching, trying not to cry, and trying not to throw up. \n\nThis doesn\u2019t make sense to me. You can easily look at someone\u2019s eyes/forehead without needing to freakin\u2019 stare at their open mouth. I mean, come on. \n\n\n>It's also considered rude to get up and leave because people like OPs fathers GF would likely demand you stay and talk and get offended with you for trying to distance yourself.\n\nYou have no idea if that\u2019s actually true or not, and this also isn\u2019t what even happened, so I\u2019m not even going to address this. \n\n>Managing this is not that easy.

I think you\u2019re someone who\u2019s maybe hyper focused on all the obstacles and the ways other people can accommodate you, and less focused on the \u201ccan do\u201d, and the ways you can manage it yourself.
