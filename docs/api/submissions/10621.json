It's a way of showing interest and love.", "Yeah, YTA.  Make some effort.", "YTA. I was married to someone who made me make all the plans, look after details, organize our lives,etc. Both of us gainfully employed, with children. The term is \"emotional labor.\" We divorced. There were many problems, but this was a significant one. I did not feel loved. I felt like his parent.\n\nMy SO of 12 years regularly makes the plans, more than half the time. I know he wants to see me, and he makes me feel loved. In fact, he went so far on our first ever dinner date, it blew me away. Made dinner reservations at an exclusive restaurant on Mother's Day. My ex would never, ever.\n\nSo, if you want to stay married and make your partner's life better, put some effort into it. She'll feel loved, your relationship will be better, and you'll feel appreciated.

And why is it so hard for men to do a little planning?", "YTA, but I understand it isn't intentional. \n\nI make lots of decisions all day at work. I also work from home, and have offered to take on most (if not all) the home stuff. I do all the laundry, dishes, cleaning, etc. because I am home and have an insanely flexible job. I never get mad about those things. \n\nBut then, after making every decision all day long, when I get asked what I want to do for dinner I am just all decision'd out. I simply will tell him \"I cannot make another decision today. You pick, PLEASE, and I won't argue with your choice\". It helps that he hears me at work sometimes and realizes how decisive I have to be and gets that by that point I don't want to make another choice that day. \n\nYour wife chose something small to blow up about, but that doesn't mean the issue is small. You've stated in your replies that she does more of the mental load. That is so insanely taxing, on anyone. Not only does she have to decide 10x more things than you, but you get to benefit from all her planning by just showing up. You get to have a fun, fulfilled life that you don't have to participate in planning or executing. It makes the decision maker very resentful, and then she blows up about small things like what to do for dinner and is left looking crazy. \n\nPlease take a real look at the division of labor, including mental, in your home. Do not ask her what you can/should do to help either because that just adds another task for her to do. No one stands behind her and tells her what her next task is, so having to do that for you is just a slap in the face.

The answer to the questions dictates if you\u2019re the AH. \n\nI\u2019ve been with my husband 13 years now. A little over a year ago it started to bother me that he has NEVER planned a single date, outing, NOTHING! Even our first date, I planned. Every single date, every single time we escaped the kids for a night, every single time we had a family outing or vacation ALL ME. I\u2019m not sure exactly when I became aware of it, but once I did it became glaring. Last year for our anniversary I told him ahead of time I wanted to go out and said nothing more. I put the forethought in and asked our daughter in law to watch our younger kids but didn\u2019t plan what to do, childcare is the hardest aspect of dates for us. He made no plans, nothing! So last minute decision (by me) made and we went to a restaurant that we like and went straight home. Out less than 2 hrs. The whole ride home I was suggesting other things to do but he paid no attention and we went home. I was near tears but here is what made me the AH too, I didn\u2019t say anything. \n\nA couple months later my mom was in town visiting, I asked her if she\u2019d watch the kids one weekend night so we could go out and told him I\u2019d like to go do something by ourselves. We hadn\u2019t had a date since 4 months earlier on the disastrous anniversary. Of course, nothing was planned. In fact he screwed around and hung out with our oldest son and came home late so we went no where. I snapped. Yelled about how he\u2019d never planned a single night out with me even when I manage the harder aspect of childcare. Does he not like spending time with me? Does he not care enough to plan anything for me? Does he think so little of me? The snapping is also an AH thing because I never mentioned it to him before. I need to open my mouth and tell him what I need, and I NEED to feel like he cares enough about me to spend a little time making plans for us for an evening. \n\nSo he \u201cplanned\u201d for us to go to a concert 3 months later. Aka he bought tickets. Concert 2 hours away. He didn\u2019t plan childcare or if we were driving home at midnight after it. So I arranged for oldest son and daughter in law to stay with our youngers and TOLD him to book a hotel. Had to remind him like 4 times but he finally did it. I wasn\u2019t happy I had to put so much effort into the date \u201che was planning,\u201d but it was something. Only apparently he had gotten an email the concert was cancelled several weeks before it and never read it. I found out that day when I was looking up details while packing to go for the night. I told him and said since hotel is booked to figure out what else we could do. He didn\u2019t. He let me figure out some place to eat and that was it. He said sorry his planning is so bad, I\u2019m so much better at it. \n\nThat was October. Nothing has been planned by either of us since. Now that I have expressed my need for him to make plans and he hasn\u2019t done it, he is solely the AH. I love the asshole, but he\u2019s the asshole. \n\nIt takes time and thought to plan things. Even a date, you look at reviews, you plan getting there and parking and such, maybe reservations, consider if your partner will like something there. Maybe look at what\u2019s around it to do before or after. During that time you are thinking about your partner and how to make them happy with that. Those of us who do it, do so with love and consideration of the other. When we don\u2019t receive that back, it makes us wonder if you 1) appreciate and enjoy all the time we put into doing it for you and enjoy actually doing these things and 2) why you don\u2019t care enough about us to do it in return. It\u2019s hurtful on both fronts. \n\nSo if your wife has previously told you she needs this and you haven\u2019t stepped up, YTA. If she hasn\u2019t told you before this, you\u2019re currently ESH. If you don\u2019t PROPERLY rectify this, you will be the only the asshole. Well, you and my husband so I guess not the only one.", "YTA. You\u2019re putting all of the mental burden of planning activities on her.

You be the designated driver - so she can enjoy her wine.  Stay off your phone during the meal.  Listen to her.  Make her laugh.  Ask her questions.  Pay attention.  Give her your time and energy.\n\nAnother date, ask her if she wants to go to a movie.  Pay attention to what kind of movies she likes and offer to see something she has previously expressed interest in.  Maybe go for drinks and appetizers afterwards - if that's an option.  \n\nBook a couples massage on a Saturday morning (maybe for a special occassion.) \n\nIf you have the money and time, book a weekend away.  Sometimes a cute little hotel in a town an hour away feels like a romantic holiday where you can read, sleep, eat and hang out together.  \n\nPlan ahead and give her a chance to get ready, plan what she wants to eat that day (I like to save up my appetite for my night out), mentally enjoy looking forward to an outing.

That way, he knows that if he hates that option, I'm fine with changing because the choice wasn't a *preference*, but rather an *answer*, so we could both get past whatever was blocking us from choosing.", "Lol, do we have the same ex?", "OMG my ex did this too! \n\n\"Well, I didn't know it had X in it.\"\n\nMaybe actually read the description on the menu?", "Right?! That's such a rare thing to see on this sub! OP seemed to almost immediately recognize that he did, in fact, fuck up, and he's already making plans to improve. Big props to OP, as long as he follows through (I think he will) then I'm sure his wife will be pleased and feel loved.", "You are definitely the Brain and not Pinky.  \ud83d\ude04", "One fun hack: Magic Eightball. Physical OR the App.\n\nPerson: \"Do we go to the art museum now?\"\n\nMagic Eightball: \"Try again later.\"\n\nPerson: \"Oh, ok, what about pancakes.\"\n\nMagic Eightball: \"Signs point to yes.\"\n\nPerson: \"Ok, pancakes it is!\"\n\nThere's also a lot of coin flip apps. \"Heads we go to the restaurant, tails we stay in.\"\n\nI like to use a suggestion box style thing. Each box is a different thing: the what (e.g., cooking, dancing, puzzling), the how (e.g., take a class, \"just make it up as you go\", make a night of it, find a way to do it outside, etc.), and the how much (e.g., light/flexible, intense but not competative, \"all out--no holding back--plan to take the next day off\").\n\nSo you can have puzzling, find way to do it outside, intense but not competative -- take a puzzle and a picnic basket to the park and maybe actually finish it (since the cats won't be there to steal the pieces).\n\nYou can rotate things in/out based on season or interest (e.g., ok we've done like 20 puzzles in the last few months... let's take that one out of the box).\n\nI also love Random Events near me--unfortunately, the thing I used before is gone. It would literally give you a random listed even from any given day in your area. (It was awesome.) Now I Google \"events near me today\" and browse, which isn't as good. (Dunno why, but I love the novelty of seeing truly random and entirely real events near me.)\n\nThough hacks will likely vary by what the individual struggles with. Indecisiveness? Boredom persistance? Execuative dysfunction? A combo platter?"]}
