Maybe put together a list of restaurants you like or write them down on scraps of paper and draw one at random.

It's not that difficult to pick a place. Often when you're the chooser you get to subtly change things to suit your preferences, which you'd probably not realise you're doing.

If you two were dating and you did this, do you think she would want to stick around? She obviously had hopes you would plan SOMETHING.

Sometimes (sometimes more often depending on your partner\u2019s love language), you need to show you care by taking your partner out on a date without burdening them with the logistics to suck all the fun out of it. Your wife doesn\u2019t feel treated when going out of a Friday night puts her in charge of finding a babysitter, researching restaurants for budgeting, making a reservation, sending a link, getting confirmation.

She obviously wanted you to put in some effort to plan something and you couldn\u2019t even do that.", "I'm not gonna lie this make me laugh because I'm indecisive too lol, I would say nta but next time narrow it down to a few options and let her pick out of those options, that way you both get something enjoyable but you don't leave all the work on her.", "YTA You sound like a boring and at the same time exhausting partner.", "YTA if your always making her pick and organise your couple stuff.

Start thinking about things you'd actually like to do.  \n\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nIt seems your wife is tired of you not showing interest on doing actual plans with her. As per your comments, you don't usually make any plans, so maybe your wife is feeling less important than she used to be.\n\nTry and make a plan, even a small one. It's a way of showing interest and love.", "Yeah, YTA.  Make some effort.", "YTA. I was married to someone who made me make all the plans, look after details, organize our lives,etc. Both of us gainfully employed, with children. The term is \"emotional labor.\" We divorced. There were many problems, but this was a significant one. I did not feel loved. I felt like his parent.\n\nMy SO of 12 years regularly makes the plans, more than half the time. I know he wants to see me, and he makes me feel loved. In fact, he went so far on our first ever dinner date, it blew me away. Made dinner reservations at an exclusive restaurant on Mother's Day. My ex would never, ever.\n\nSo, if you want to stay married and make your partner's life better, put some effort into it. She'll feel loved, your relationship will be better, and you'll feel appreciated. Or keep doing what you're doing, my man, but it doesn't sound like a happy existence for either of you.", "Plan a date you lazy AH", "YTA. And why is it so hard for men to do a little planning?", "YTA, but I understand it isn't intentional. \n\nI make lots of decisions all day at work. I also work from home, and have offered to take on most (if not all) the home stuff. I do all the laundry, dishes, cleaning, etc. because I am home and have an insanely flexible job. I never get mad about those things. \n\nBut then, after making every decision all day long, when I get asked what I want to do for dinner I am just all decision'd out. I simply will tell him \"I cannot make another decision today. You pick, PLEASE, and I won't argue with your choice\". It helps that he hears me at work sometimes and realizes how decisive I have to be and gets that by that point I don't want to make another choice that day. \n\nYour wife chose something small to blow up about, but that doesn't mean the issue is small. You've stated in your replies that she does more of the mental load. That is so insanely taxing, on anyone. Not only does she have to decide 10x more things than you, but you get to benefit from all her planning by just showing up. You get to have a fun, fulfilled life that you don't have to participate in planning or executing. It makes the decision maker very resentful, and then she blows up about small things like what to do for dinner and is left looking crazy. \n\nPlease take a real look at the division of labor, including mental, in your home. Do not ask her what you can/should do to help either because that just adds another task for her to do. No one stands behind her and tells her what her next task is, so having to do that for you is just a slap in the face. Pick some things to take over for her and just do them. \n\nI just finished the book \"Fair Play\" that might be an interesting read for you to get a better handle on how she might be feeling.", "YTA.

Making decisions all the time is exhausting, even if the husband doesn\u2019t care he should care about what his partner cares about. I\u2019m not even going to get into the generic misogyny of your last statement.", ">If you're the fussy one - it's your job to choose.\n\nFair enough, but even when there *isn't* a \"fussy one\", there's still tends to be one person doing to heavy lifting regarding plans/decisions.", "This is lazy as fuck.", "Oh no, I'm 51 years old. It's too late to change me. Luckily, my tribe understands me.", "You better hurry up, 40 is really late. Even if she doesn\u2019t have the words for it, your wife already knows and she sounds fed up.", "No one is naturally good at it. Your wife puts effort into it because she cares about you and your relationship. You are giving her the message that you don\u2019t put effort into it because you don\u2019t care about her or your relationship. You have to try in order to get better. If you find yourself single, \u201cI don\u2019t know, what do you want to do\u201d will not lead to many second dates.", "But why do you sound so passive about it? Grow up and take responsibility. You have *actively* been avoiding responsibility.", "Yupp this was probably a final straw. Probably been an issue for a while.", "And then put actions to it. Find a babysitter, figure out what time you're leaving and how you're getting there, let her know how to dress for the activities", "But also make sure she does want you to plan it ahead of time, she might have something in mind and has just not shared it yet.

Look up ideas on fun things to do now, so you don't have to come up with soe.thi g on the spot.

It gets to the point where it just feels Ike you're not even trying or don't even care to try. This is her way of showing that frustration. It finally built up and it sounds like instead of trying, you wanted to \"win\" and yet again put in zero effort to making her happy, only proving her point.", "It caused an argument because she\u2019s probably the one making the majority of the decisions the majority of the time.

Do you even enjoy spending time with her?
