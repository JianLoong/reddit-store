The kid regularly runs into the walls in the house she has lived in for 10+ years. \n\nOf course some people will be decent drivers but I am not sure that it is the likely experience. I looked it up and people with ADHD are more likely to be involved in accidents of all sorts, not just because of inattentiveness but risky behaviors. I am kind of surprised that it is a controversial statement because the findings were so conclusive.", "I've noticed my plain ADHD friends are relatively good drivers but the ones with autism or autism/ADHD are either incredibly good or know they wouldn't be safe and don't drive at all.", "Where do you live that a doctor has to sign off on you getting a license? I\u2019ve never heard of doctors even having an input, but I\u2019m in the States.", "[citation needed]", "Or learn to put away her fucking cellphone.", "And the stealth poles. They suddenly just stand there", "All these anecdotes are SO intriguing! Personally -  I might find driving rewarding if I tried it, but I also might kill a bunch of people or myself. Walking and cycling is free, and using public transportation supports building more of it. I hate GPS because it tells you left, right, and straight, when I want to go north, south, east, or west. Left and right changes too much based on which direction you are facing, and while it makes sense for pointing where my coffee cup is on my desk, I find it so confusing for navigating a whole, fixed city.\n\nAnother person mentioned the autism + ADHD connection and I think that's a very relevant combo to explore in addition to the hyperactive vs. inattentive dichotomy.", "Well that's quite a thought-provoking wrinkle, because you made me curious and a bit of googling on my own showed similar conclusions about the increased recklessness when driving. (Obviously I'm not a researcher or doctor in this field, so grain of salt, etc. but there's still a lot of collaborating stats out there.)\n\nSo from my previous knowledge, there's hyperactive ADHD and inattentive ADHD (or sometimes \"combined\" is considered a 3rd type). There's some overlap, and some differences, and often the differences are nearly the opposites of each other (an inattentive person might be quiet because they're daydreaming or busy processing info, while a hyperactive person might be bouncing off the walls.)  Inattentive ADHD has a higher percentage of women than hyperactive, and also tends to be diagnosed later.  And younger and male drivers are way more prone to car accidents in the general population.  When I read \"recklessness\" it made me wonder if there wasn't a possibility that the hyperactive-type wasn't overrepresented in the data. Inattentive ADHD people who aren't formally diagnosed (or diagnosed yet) who are being extra cautious and compensating with hyperfocus, and are excellent drivers would be in the stats as \"safe, non-ADHD\" drivers. Inattentive types who don't want to even risk driving won't be in the driving stats at all. And hyperactive ADHD people are often diagnosed as young children, etc.\n\nSo yeah, it's going to be controversial to make generalizations about demographics with a stigmatized and not yet understood (type of brain? neuro setup? not sure how to put it) even if current stats are on your side, because even in research there are a lot of unintended assumptions or unknown confounding variables that are going to cause a huge gulf between the average lived experiences of the group and the available research.  And it takes a long time for those to converge over time as studies get more specific and those confounding variables get accounted for.\n\nI'm not surprised the type of ADHD people who like reading and writing thoughtful comments on Reddit (i.e., the ADHD subs on here seem to skew VERY inattentive-type) and are extremely conscientious about their driving would be surprised to hear that they and their friends are seen as more likely to be \"reckless\".  (Like, me? Reckless? It takes me 10 minutes to decide what shoes I'm going to wear, I'm not distracted, changing the batteries in the hygrometer to see if it's too humid for canvas shoes is a crucial step for the Picking Shoes Project, and obviously I'm going to change the batteries in the cat toy while I'm at it...)\n\nI don't know if the research is \"wrong\" or \"right\" or, imo most likely, true for a certain set of conditions that is easiest to gather data on at this time. But it's good to remain open-minded and curious when we \"learn\" something, because we're all really just learning what the edge of knowledge is at this time. And if a conclusion about a group of people being studied is both really counter-intuitive \\*and\\* they can find possible flaws in the study, it's especially important for researchers to dig deeper with more specific studies.", "Oooh, well that would DEFINITELY explain my friend group.\n\nI've been told by more uh, assumed neurotypical folks that I would probably be an incredibly good driver because I'm so conscientious about everything, but I'm not willing to risk ploughing into the back of an SUV and killing a family of 5 because I saw a sign for salted licorice ice cream and it made me wonder if the ice cream itself is licorice, or if it is just vanilla that has pieces of licorice \\*in\\* it, just to find out how good a driver I am.", "I guess there is only one state. Oops, FM guess I have to delete stuff again. They need an eye exam as well.", "There have been multiple studies. I didn't deep dive into it and make spreadsheets, but it seemed the increased risk was consistent into adulthood among unmedicated or untreated adults with ADHD. \n\nColumbia University published a study earlier this month on adult drivers with ADHD. I think that study was focused on older adults.\n\nMore studies have been done on ADHD and accidents in general since it is a leading cause of death in people with ADHD. In some of those studies they will further specify types of accidents and the likelihood of people with ADHD being involved in them.\n\nThe information, from reliable sources, is not hard to find.", "And why repairs are so expensive.", "Wait, are you saying that astigmatism can be related to ADHD meds?"]}
