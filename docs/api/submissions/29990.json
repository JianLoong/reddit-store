I think it\u2019s easier to frame it as \u201cit\u2019s not you, this is just my baby and I don\u2019t want anyone to touch it.\u201d \n\nAnd driving isn\u2019t something you are either good or bad at. Like all things, some are naturally a little better, but everyone is bad when they start, and some improve faster while some never improve. Do everything you can for the sake of your wife, your finances, and the general public. Maybe she needs a backup camera, or collision detection, whatever it may be. I wouldn\u2019t let her drive or buy any car that didn\u2019t have a long list of features like that and please pay for driving school for her", "NTA She isn't a bad driver, she is careless. The fact that you are always there to remedy/rectify her carelessness has meant she has no incentive to change. How dare she be upset?! I question if she should be on the road at all!", "NTA she isn\u2019t responsible enough to drive it.", "The only red flag I see is \u201cI will pay for it\u201d Aren\u2019t you married? Do you have her on an allowance or something? It\u2019s both your money.", "NTA. Does she not realize that this is not normal and maybe should take a refresher course in driving?  This is scary.\n\nI personally don't drive anymore, as I am not comfortable driving and realize that one mistake with a car can take a life. \n\nI know not everyone can do this but I intentionally live where I can take public transportation/ride my bike.", "Is she in denial about the fact she\u2019s a terrible driver? Does she text and drive? Take your keys with you.", "The comments have pretty much covered what I was going to say.\n\nNTA.", "Bite the bullet and rent her a car while you're gone.", "If you\u2019re gonna pay for her Ubers, couldn\u2019t she just rent a car and pay for that?", "Rent her a car while you are gone.

Like is her vision okay, reflexes etc", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a stereotype for a reason. She has proven she is not very attentive of a driver in the past and you offered a viable solution if she needed to go somewhere. The only other thing I would maybe attempt is getting a cheap rental for that duration if she wants to be able to get up and drive immediately. \n\nMost people know at least one person that tries to get the new high score for most curbs hit and and most parking blocks scrapped.\n\nIf my nephew wanted to borrow my car or truck, I would lend it to him without a second guess because knock on wood he\u2019s had his first car for years and has not had a ding or ticket in it, actually looks in better shape than when he first got it. \n\nIf my niece wanted to borrow my car and it was an emergency, I\u2019d make her call an ambulance or an Uber. She hit a curb within the first 15 minutes of being gifted brand new white rims, this after having Pac-Man\u2019d the last set in a pothole.

I would offer to rent a car for those days. Waste of money? Maybe. Only if she didn\u2019t ding your car. THAT would be expensive. \n\nTaking Uber would suck", "A rental might be helpful.", "I\u2019m surprised they still insure her \ud83d\udc80", "Careless is a good word for it. Even a bad driver that pays attention isn't gonna run into a stationary pole.", "I would suggest a good eye exam also. OP's wife may have a problem and not know it.", "Fuck people like OP's spouse. Seriously dangerous people on the road every day. \n\nAutos are like guns but for some reason we don't treat it like they're dangerous. \n\nI nearly guarantee your wife has almost *killed* several people in her time driving but has not mentioned it to you and you know nothing about it. People like that don't just get better or magically start caring and taking accountability for their driving. It's just \"them\" and it's fucking infuriating.\n\nEDIT: For additional context I was an auto liability adjuster for 4 years and now am in auto medical. Seen some shit.", "Yep, at this point, just move to a place with decent public transport options and don\u2019t drive", "Whilst incredibly annoying, there is a reason workplaces treat even the most Minor car scrape as a 'near miss'.", "Nah, you just have to run it in reverse for a while.", "Or park at the airport.

Just make sure you get the insurance.", "I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not reporting all these claims to insurance. He\u2019d either get dropped or be paying several thousand a month.", "Point taken, but just FYI - everyone seems to recollect Paul Walker as the one driving -  he was actually the passenger.", ">Let her take Uber\n\nThis is the answer until she gets her eyes examined and a new driving course. She is a danger on the road.", "So are you suggesting that OP report her and try to get her license revoked?", "Yea, who cares if she causes thousands of dollars in damages, better that as opposed to offending her with a criticism of her driving ability.", "With a modern car you can do tens of thousands of dollars of damage in seconds, and with all the supply chain issues, I\u2019ve heard from friends of waiting 6 months+ for parts.", "Astigmatisms that are affecting her depth perception so she's always scraping curbs and backing into things because she really can't judge distances?", "\\^Exactly. I posted a similar comment before I saw yours. Sounds like she has vision problems and doesn't know.", "Indeed! She may have even caused some accidents already that she was too oblivious to even notice!", "sure about that Bueller?", "Probably safer for the car to be with the wife than in an airport parking lot.", "It's weird you mention ADHD because I've never seen anything that says it's more common for us to be bad drivers or get into accidents. This is anecdotal but myself and everyone I know with ADHD tend to hyperfocus on driving and we're pretty decent drivers overall.", "Of course, its not a true reddit thread until somebody throws out their theory that ADHD is the cause of the problem.", "I mean, she\u2019s a grown woman so there\u2019s nothing he can really do. I\u2019m just baffled that the conversation is \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable with you driving my car, since you keep damaging yours\u201d and not \u201cI\u2019m worried about you driving any car since you keep getting into accidents\u201d. \n\nShe literally just hit a pole.

Some medical issues, such as PPD, psychosis, Parkinson's, Dementia, loss of sight/hearing have slow progression, and goes unnoticed by the patient. Add to that, human instinct is to deny failure of health, so denial. Close family members in these instances are instrumental in helping their family member access the correct medical care, which often is just the ticket. A pair of glasses can be life changing and life giving - in a rejuvenating way. So having a series of difficult conversations with a partner means that you help them to access whatever interventions are needed, and is done with their consent, and increases their wellbeing and autonomy.\n\nTelling your partner that they are no longer allowed to drive with no further action is abusive, because it removes their independence, is infantilising, and only licensing or healthcare staff can make that decision for another autonomous person. Sorry for being a bit clinical about it, but I hope it kinda helps people out with it. For example, if you are feeling guilty about what the correct course of action for a loved one is: don't feel guilty. Just get professional medical help, and be honest with your loved one about your concerns.", "You\u2019re right, but it seems like the only conversations he\u2019s had with her center around concern for the vehicle damage, not her safety, which is insane", "We do as well for up to 30 days $1500.00 whichever is less.", "And the root cause was tirs that were way way way past their expiration date and had essentially no grip.", "I think the 3 of us are showing our age \ud83e\udd23", "Prob.

Reddit\u2019s an odd place.", "Right, I was like what the hell\u2026", "People with ADHD are for sure more likely to get into car accidents. It is enough of a concern that my daughter's doctor is unsure if he is going to sign off on her getting a licence until she is older. I could find another doctor when she is 16 who might not care but I looked it up, it is a thing", "It is on my mind, lol, we just had a discussion about driving with my kids doctor since she is almost that age.", "I want to know what their insurance premiums are. F....", "Also OP, if you read this, start with a trip immediately to a therapist who can help you communicate what you've observed, and a pretty sharp doctor's appointment after (assuming that she agrees). I hope for the best outcome for you", "I am sure after her first few accidents he had that convo with her. This particular convo is hands off my dream car please.", "No, not unless it's on the policy.  \n\nBut if OP rented his wife a car for the week they could get insurance on the rental so she could just walk away from the car she inevitably fucks up.", "Yeah, but with her driving history - you'd still want to load on whatever insurances the rental car company offers, which will considerably increase the price. While you \\*could\\* just rely on the rental coverage your regular policy has, if anything happens that means a deductible and strikes against your claim history.", "But what about not getting the chance to fix it?\n\n[Luton airport car park fire 11th Oct 2023](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-67073446#)", "Ok, fair enough haha.", "I'm guessing they don't report the vast majority of it, which is why she still has insurance.", "OP will be gone for a week though.  His wife would need the car for more than just driving to/from work.  There's errands, grocery shopping...", "Ok. Ya got me there. I was thinking more smashed window stolen change kinda fixing. I mean i know my partner is a crap driver. But whats the % risk at an airport. Might be worth a write off depending how much they have to pay that insurance doesn\u2019t cover.  Gotta wonder what the deductibles are on someone with a shit driving record.", "I had a really weird side effect of my ADHD meds once I got my diagnosis (at 30, had my license since I was 19)\nI didnt notice it at first because I don't own a car, but the next time I rented one, I noticed my depth perception dissappeared completely after sunset so s/o and i planned all driving to be during daytime (he doesnt have a license). It took some time after that until I figured out that I had astigmatism. Some frames later and now I feel safe behind the wheel at night again."]}
