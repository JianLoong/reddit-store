Not that she needs your permission, but I\u2019m shocked you haven\u2019t insisted that she not drive at all until she can do so safely. I would be extremely concerned for her safety (and others) if I were in your position.", "NTA. It's *your* car, not a family car. She's a horrible driver. Sounds like she shouldn't be behind the wheel at all. Definitely make sure all sets of car keys leave with you while you're away. Better still, don't leave your car at home, park it somewhere else.", "NTA\n\nYour reaction is fair and she knows it.\n\nSounds like she should either get her vision checked or get some remedial driving lessons.", "NTA - She's proved that there's a good chance she'd damage your car or worse.

I think you should look at her insurance and see if rental is an option especially that's what happened to me when someone destroyed my car.", "NTA. I would suggest she gets driving classes being a bad driver isn\u2019t a personality quirk and if she\u2019s constantly crashing her car she probably shouldn\u2019t be driving. \n\nShe sounds extremely negligent and careless with the most dangerous day to day activity most people engage in.", "Nta, hide your keys now.", "It's sad when people get angry that you point out facts", "Info why don\u2019t you have coverage for a rental car if her car is in an accident & needs repaired?

BUT, I personally would find Ubering everywhere to be massively anxiety causing. Maybe rent a car for the week?  That would be crazy expensive in my area at the moment, but maybe your locale is different. Also, I know my auto insurance covers a certain amount each day for a rental and they help you find one. Not sure what your situation is regarding that, but it might help get her situated in a cost effective and comfortable way.", "It's not the family car, it's *YOUR* car, big difference.
