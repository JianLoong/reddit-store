But she obviously still benefits from me and the others when we bring food and drinks and she brings nothing. I've always thought it was unfair but nobody wanted to say anything so I left it alone.\n\nI should also mention that she's a friend by association, I've only known her since the beginning of this year.\n\nI confronted her like many of you suggested and started off by saying I thought it was unfair her bf was taking ALL the food and that's why I spoke up.\n\nShe said she's sorry, and the bf only did that cos he didn't think anyone would mind. I should say that even though she eats at these things, she's never taken copious amounts of food before.\n\nI said that I don't speak on behalf of EVERYONE but I feel it's unfair that she keeps bringing her bf and also that she never contributes to anything. \n\nSince she had just been apologetic, I thought she would respond by saying that she would start to contribute but instead, she asked why I cared so much because I don't even eat ribs and that I embarrassed her and her bf for nothing. \n\nI don't eat meat but that was beside the point. My friend put a lot of hours into cooking those ribs just for this guy to take em all? No, it's not right. \n\nAnd I didn't make a scene, HE did. I spoke very politely. So I explained that again and said that she's been an inconsiderate friend. \n\nShe said, \"I don't know why you're attacking me when nobody else has a problem\", then said that she didn't want to associate with me anymore. I said that was fine and that was the end of it. \n\nI told the others the outcome and the friend that introduced mooch to us was really mad that I caused a \"rift\" between everyone over food. \n\nSo the group essentially split up and those who were irritated with me will continue to hang out with her. \n\nThe others who secretly found her annoying but were too polite also spoke up and decided to branch off too. \n\nOur mooch free group hung out a coupla times already and all the complaints are finally being released \ud83d\ude02 Also EVERYBODY brings something now which is nice. Not just that but it's a more relaxing and stress free environment without them. \n\nThe \"introducer\" friend is trying to poach some of the new group to no avail which I think is funny but anyway, that's it \ud83d\ude02. Sorry if this was anti-climactic. And I know this is like juvenile, high school stuff but hey, that's what happened.", "created_utc": 1701283354, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/186wrmt/update_aita_for_telling_my_friends_bf_that_he/", "score": 2426, "replies": ["> Our mooch free group hung out a coupla times already and all the complaints are finally being released \ud83d\ude02 Also EVERYBODY brings something now which is nice.\n\nPerfect way to end things. \n\nYour hangouts will be a lot more pleasant going forward.", "Good for you!\n\nI think your former acquaintance is trying to poach on your friend group because her pockets is starting to whine. LOL! Paying for another person feels a bit different, when its just the two of them versus in a group of nine.", "The mooch group will lose members as the cost burden grows.", "I mean the previous thread spelled it out in upvotes.  \n\n\nWhy are you, or anyone tolerating this behavior? Why?   \n\n\nI cannot imagine being friends with someone who isn't struggling, but shows up to group events and just orders, consumes, enjoys, and NEVER contributes.   \n\n\nI have been in a position where I couldn't afford to do something and have made that clear, and have had friends OFFER to pay for my portion. I've done the same for friends many times myself. If there's a monetary issue, and I value someone's company, and its communicated, who cares?  \n\n\nBut to have a person whos perfectly able to pay and just... doesn't? That isn't ever happening around me more than once. It's absolutely ridiculous.", "I think this happens more than it should. People who feel the same way as you won't speak up, are glad that you did, but only back you behind closed doors. I think that's crappy but hopefully they'll learn and grow from this. It's nice that they created their own mooch-free group that you're a part of though. At least you don't have to deal with mooches one and two, and their followers. Good riddance!", "I love that this is such a normal person happy ending. She didn't learn a lesson and then you all laughed together like a U.S. sitcom. You fairly quietly ditched the annoying people and their enablers and now can hang out with people who all chip in and make an effort.", "*And I know this is like juvenile, high school stuff*\n\nUnfortunately, this goes on in all age groups.  \n\nI've read so many things online about seemingly sweet older women taking tupper ware or large purses to parties so that they can score more meals.  \n\nOr how about the funeral goers who didn't know the dearly beloved very well or at all, but hit every funeral in town so that they can eat at the luncheon afterwards.\n\nGood for you, OP, for putting the moochers in their place.\n\nNTA", "I love this. I have a friend like this that we distanced ourselves from for just being overall shitty. One of the girlies got married and was like omg we kind of have to tell this friend. So the bride invited her to the evening do and she said maybe. The wedding happened, no word from the friend the whole lead up because this is what she does, so flaky and when we went back into the reception after dinner SHE WAS JUST STOOD THERE!!! like she herself was the wedding gift. Then threatened me if I didn't make her my bridesmaid (I'm the engaged one of the trio) she'd 'kick me in the tits', proceeded to hang off my neck and tell me she misses me despite ghosting us for years, trapped my fianc\u00e9 in a corner telling him she was gonna show up on my door step for a \u2728surprise visit\u2728 and then drunk cry that again she misses us. \n\nI need to do this with her...", "I can't believe anyone was willing to put up with her \"mooching\" (a.k.a. stealing from her friends) in the first place. That's so bizarre to me.", "Looks like y\u2019all ditched more deadweight than you thought you would. Great job OP. I\u2019m proud of you. \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udf8a\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf7e", "NTA Glad you were able to separate yourself from that person. Hope your mooch free group continues to do well and possibly grow to contain more like minded friends.", "So, I don't know ya'lls ages, but her saying she won't associate with you anymore doesn't really sound like a death penalty. She either is trying to save face on her bf's behalf, or she actually does agree with him. \n\nI hope the other friends stand up for you, but honestly, they may feel the need to \"keep the peace\" which honestly is code for not wanting to face the change. I maintain you're NTA although I didn't comment on the original post. \nThat simply isn't okay behaviour and I can't even imagine one of my friends doing that", "I cringed at your previous post. Ribs are expensive! And stealing the host's Tupperware?! It's one thing if leftovers are offered, but it shouldn't be assumed. I guess similarly half my family is vegetarian, including the auntie who hosted, so we usually make sure the relatives who do eat meat take those leftovers. My sister took an extra large container of stuffing that had sausage in it to feed to her boyfriend. Auntie kept pies, mashed potatoes and other stuff. But we all agreed on the distribution of leftovers.", "This is a great outcome!!  I hope you have a ton of fun with your new friend group!!", "This feels like a mature resolution, not a juvenile one. \n\nIt's pretty calm on your end, the issues are over, yall aren't dwelling on it or anything.", "Nothing makes me angrier than moochers. Recently had a falling out with friends because I didn't think, in addition to paying fair market rate for weed from this guy, it was appropriate we were just expected to shower one guy with \"gifts\" and \"appreciation\" just because he was our dealer. Literally he'd sell us weed and then get pissed if we didn't smoke it with him.\n\nStraw that broke my back was we were ordering food and he was refusing to order until somebody would take him outside and smoke him out. \n\nThe motherfucker pulled out his phone and revealed that he kept track of who bought his food and who smoked him out. Not with the intention to pay us back but, in his words, \"to keep track of tribute\". \n\nI think that's the loudest I've ever cussed in a public place.", "Well, that's a nice happy ending!", "There\u2019s now a smaller group for moocher so guess which group won\u2019t last long. \n\nLove it!", "Everyone who wants to pay for the leech does, and everyone who doesn\u2019t, doesn\u2019t. Best outcome, really.", "I find it really astonishing how some people go in life without basic respect and consideration for others. Good for you and the others for haven a more relax environment without smoothers and enablers.", "I used to have a coworker like this. She didn't celebrate birthdays, holidays, etc. However she was always at the recipients desk afterwards hinting about how she wouldn't say no to leftovers. When she did it to me I looked her dead in the eye and told her no, I was taking it home to my family. She acted all surprised and walked off in a huff.", "NTA. You are RIGHT. Stand up to people like that.", "NTA. It was rude for him and her to think it was ok to take all the left over ribs. Those suckers are expensive.", "I'm glad you're rid of the mooch and her hog BF.", "I'm guessin the Poacher realizes the ones sticking with her are also mooching and there isn't enough food that makes her and BF unhappy lol. The rift she decided to start actually made things better for you and your true friends. As it makes for more relaxed outings :3", "If some jag off came to a party and tried to take all the ribs home\u2026.. I would fucking lose it. \n\nThere would be flames.

You did the best thing. It was pretty brave of you to confront them on your own, and you did something that\u2019ll created a better friend group that will stick around.", "That splinter group with the moocher and introducer are not going to last long.  When there were many folks who were able to spread out the cost of covering the moocher then the financial pressure is less.  When the same person is having to cover the moocher's, the breaking point will be reached.  \n\nI also can't imagine what justification the friends who went off with the moocher could possibly have...", "Look my comment on the previous post mentioned that you were going way out your way to contact her to explain when they are the ones in the wrong.  \nI appreciate that you wanted to mend things because you have friends in common but this kind of people will take that as you acknowledging you were wrong and they were right.", "Women \u2615", "The ironic thing is that she\u2019ll probably contribute in the new group now because she\u2019s been called out and knows people in the new group now have eyes on those actions specifically when it comes to her", "Addition by subtraction.", "The new friend group sounds perfect. Also I applaud you, you tried to offer a critique for her to improve upon. The optics of never contributing or taking all the leftovers is bad. Her statement \u201cI don't know why you're attacking me when nobody else has a problem\" is inaccurate. She might go through a lot more of her life oblivious to her rude actions.", "I\u2019m super confused.\n\nThere were some people who prefer to be friends with the moocher? What?\n\nYou\u2019re claiming that there were some people who enjoyed being ripped off all the time?", "I mean even if you\u2019re struggling financially you can contribute SOMETHING or even maybe effort? Help set up, don\u2019t take a ton unless you ask and people say it\u2019s ok? Idk this is bizarre behavior on their part", "I love the idea of the moocher group getting together and having a sad amount of food because no one there is making an effort.", "I just wrote something similar before I saw your comment.  I think we\u2019re right. \ud83d\ude02", "My thoughts exactly. I bet that's why the \"introducer\" friend is trying to poach from their new group already but if she thinks the moocher girl is no big deal then she can put her money where her mouth is, literally. \n\nGlad OP created a new group where equal effort/energy is exerted.", "Since Mooch's group now has fewer people to pay for said mooch, I wonder how longer until they get fed up of it.", "I showed up to a really rich person's holiday party last year. They know I'm struggling with finances but i STILL brought a decent bottle of wine as a thank you and it wasn't potluck style, just a holiday party at their house and that's what you do, you bring anything that shows you thought about them lol", "The amount of times my friends have been like, \"hey honey lemme get you something too\" because i come to hang out with them but can't spend any money and I'm telling them \"no no it's okay i ate before!\" (A granola bar or smth) and it takes like three rounds of hassling me before i begrudgingly agree to be treated. Secretly im keeping tabs on how much i'm gonna spoil them when i have money. I love my friends, couldn't imagine being a moocher", "Like, at least bring some drinks or chips. Something. Unless the host says not to bring anything.", "Even when you are quitte broke, you can make things that don't cost a lot of money but make people happy. \n\nIf you have an oven, you can make a yogurt cake (1 yogourt, 2 pots of sugar, 3 pots of flour, 1/2 pot of oil, 3 eggs, 1 teaspoon of baking powder, if you want, you can add 1 apple cut in dices - half an hour at 180\u2070C and you're good). \n\nElse, you can bring some crepes, as it is only flour, eggs and milk (and just a little bit of sugar), it is really not expensive, just a little bit time consuming and you can serve them with sugar or a jar of preserve. \n\nEven if I have good pay now, I know my friends still love when I bring them crepes.\n\nEdit : It is not to blame people who don't have enougth to pay. And if you have good friends they won't mind at all that you come empty handed. These are just ideas I used when I was student and that can make you feel more equals.", "She isn't.
