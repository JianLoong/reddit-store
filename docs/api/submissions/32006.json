But she obviously still benefits from me and the others when we bring food and drinks and she brings nothing. I've always thought it was unfair but nobody wanted to say anything so I left it alone.\n\nI should also mention that she's a friend by association, I've only known her since the beginning of this year.\n\nI confronted her like many of you suggested and started off by saying I thought it was unfair her bf was taking ALL the food and that's why I spoke up.\n\nShe said she's sorry, and the bf only did that cos he didn't think anyone would mind. I should say that even though she eats at these things, she's never taken copious amounts of food before.\n\nI said that I don't speak on behalf of EVERYONE but I feel it's unfair that she keeps bringing her bf and also that she never contributes to anything. \n\nSince she had just been apologetic, I thought she would respond by saying that she would start to contribute but instead, she asked why I cared so much because I don't even eat ribs and that I embarrassed her and her bf for nothing. \n\nI don't eat meat but that was beside the point. My friend put a lot of hours into cooking those ribs just for this guy to take em all? No, it's not right. \n\nAnd I didn't make a scene, HE did. I spoke very politely. So I explained that again and said that she's been an inconsiderate friend. \n\nShe said, \"I don't know why you're attacking me when nobody else has a problem\", then said that she didn't want to associate with me anymore. I said that was fine and that was the end of it. \n\nI told the others the outcome and the friend that introduced mooch to us was really mad that I caused a \"rift\" between everyone over food. \n\nSo the group essentially split up and those who were irritated with me will continue to hang out with her. \n\nThe others who secretly found her annoying but were too polite also spoke up and decided to branch off too. \n\nOur mooch free group hung out a coupla times already and all the complaints are finally being released \ud83d\ude02 Also EVERYBODY brings something now which is nice. Not just that but it's a more relaxing and stress free environment without them. \n\nThe \"introducer\" friend is trying to poach some of the new group to no avail which I think is funny but anyway, that's it \ud83d\ude02. Sorry if this was anti-climactic. And I know this is like juvenile, high school stuff but hey, that's what happened.", "created_utc": 1701283354, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/186wrmt/update_aita_for_telling_my_friends_bf_that_he/", "score": 4240, "replies": ["> Our mooch free group hung out a coupla times already and all the complaints are finally being released \ud83d\ude02 Also EVERYBODY brings something now which is nice.\n\nPerfect way to end things. \n\nYour hangouts will be a lot more pleasant going forward.", "Good for you!\n\nI think your former acquaintance is trying to poach on your friend group because her pockets is starting to whine.

Why?   \n\n\nI cannot imagine being friends with someone who isn't struggling, but shows up to group events and just orders, consumes, enjoys, and NEVER contributes.   \n\n\nI have been in a position where I couldn't afford to do something and have made that clear, and have had friends OFFER to pay for my portion. I've done the same for friends many times myself. If there's a monetary issue, and I value someone's company, and its communicated, who cares?  \n\n\nBut to have a person whos perfectly able to pay and just... doesn't?

Ribs are expensive! And stealing the host's Tupperware?! It's one thing if leftovers are offered, but it shouldn't be assumed.

Literally he'd sell us weed and then get pissed if we didn't smoke it with him.\n\nStraw that broke my back was we were ordering food and he was refusing to order until somebody would take him outside and smoke him out. \n\nThe motherfucker pulled out his phone and revealed that he kept track of who bought his food and who smoked him out.
