Or rather, he is having a big fancy wedding because he got (officially) married during covid, and his list of attendees was restricted to 10 people and I live about 800 kilometers away from him. He asked me to be his best woman last year in October, he told me the wedding would be the first week of September, and I accepted happily.  \n\n\nExcept - yesterday he messaged me telling me it would be at the end of June, the anniversary of his first date with his now-wife. Okay, great, except 1) the wedding is on a Tuesday, 2) I am a teacher, it does not feel right to take time off for a wedding 3) I am currently a \"contractuelle\" (basically a probationary period), and as such I have **no** paid time off unless it's medical and taking time off for \"personal\" reasons might reflect poorly on me, 4) the costs of travel, accommodation, new clothing (his wife wants a themed wedding so specific attire is required), a gift **and** lost wages will be extremely taxing on my budget, and 5) the wedding will be, again, 800 km away, so I can't just show up for the ceremony, dance until 4 AM, then suck it up and show up for work the next day.   \n\n\nI explained this all to him and apologized that if the date was set I would have to back out of the wedding, and he blew up at me, asking why I couldn't take a few days off since I have six months' notice and that \"we don't live in an \u00c9mile Zola novel\" and accused me of making up excuses just because I hate parties (he is correct about this part, we both heartily dislike crowds). And now I feel bad because I do want to be there for him (and I haven't even met his wife in person yet!) - we met in graduate school, bonded over being the only two foreigners in the group, and have been through a ton together - breakups, hangovers, immigration agents being dicks, our respective thesis defences, his pet rats being killed, etc. - the timing is just *really* bad for me and had he stuck to the early September date I 100% would have gone.

Even teachers have the right to live life, and that includes the occasional mid-week PTO for fun or celebration.  If you died on your way to work, the district would have your position posted by end of day, and admin would pull an intervention teacher until they secured a sub.\n\nSans points 1, 3, 4, and 5, with four months notice is more than enough time to take a Mon-Wed break.", "WNBTA. Changing dates of such an event is very annoying considering everyone has to allocate to their specifications and knowing you live far away and have a job and such he should at least have been understanding of your reasoning.", "NTA - he completely changed the plan you previously agreed to. And there's a huge difference between you trying to take time off mid-week in your probationary period and you trying to take time off mid-week in your second year.", "NTA. The wedding is on a Tuesday in June during your probationary period at work and is not a short distance away. If it was a weekend, I could understand him being upset. They should have seen this coming when they decided to reschedule their big celebration they are having to include all their loved ones who missed the actual marriage. You're probably not the only one who will struggle to make this work.", "I was ready to say you were an asshole, but those are a lot of perfectly valid reasons that when put together make it a problem for you. Who has a wedding on a Tuesday? NTA.", "NTA and I guarantee that your friend is going to find a lot less attendees because of his week day wedding. There will be plenty of people who ALSO will RSVP no because it's just not possible to have a fullblown wedding during the week. Or, if people DO say yes, they're not staying the entire night. \n\nI do see your friend changing the date but it won't just be because of you; it'll be because of the many, many people who also can't book a day or two off just for a wedding.", "NTA   It's very reasonable for you to miss this wedding. Your  concerns are valid & your friend isn't being very understanding  considering that he chose a day that most people work. I can see that he would be sad, but to be so resentful isn't reasonable. You most certainly can't take this time off or you could jeopardize your job & any potential you might have for obtaining a permanent contract.", "NTA if you really can\u2019t swing it. If it is a Tuesday, you would probably have to take multiple days off work. If you don\u2019t have personal time to use right now, there isn\u2019t much you can do.\n\nHowever, even as a teacher, it is okay to use personal time for things like this. You did not commit to working constantly until you die when you chose this profession. I am a therapist and I struggle a lot with taking time off for personal reasons. And I don\u2019t take time off frequently. But I am allowed to have a life outside work and so are you. Don\u2019t deny yourself things you want to do because of your profession. Even \u201chelpers\u201d (doctors, nurses, teachers, therapists, police officers, etc.) are allowed to take time away from work sometimes!\n\nBut, again, if you don\u2019t have personal time to use right now, that\u2019s totally understandable. And if you can\u2019t manage the expense right now, that\u2019s okay, too. If someone gets married on a Tuesday, they have to expect that some people won\u2019t be able to come. Depending on what events he wants you there for and what time it starts, you might have to take Monday off, too. \n\nBasically, you are NTA either way!", "NTA.\n\nI don't care how much notice you're given, if you schedule a destination wedding on a Tuesday, you have to assume a lot of people aren't going to be able to attend.\n\nAnd how arrogant to assume that guests are willing to use their limited vacation time to attend his wedding.", "NTA. He gave you a date you were 100% on board with and then changed it to probably the most inconvenient time (who has a big wedding on a Tuesday???). You have valid reasons why this won\u2019t work for you (both job wise and money wise) and while it\u2019s regrettable, it\u2019s just not fair for him to be angry when he knows the situation and he\u2019s the one that changed everything.", "NTA. Who schedules a wedding on a Tuesday? \n\nHowever, half the stuff you listed as reasons you can't attend are things you would have happily done in September, so it's a liiiittle disingenuous to claim so much of the reason is financial when presumably you would have spent a similar amount on travel, accommodation, clothes, and a gift anyway. So make sure you're actually comparing \"going to this wedding in June\" vs. \"going to this wedding in September\" and not \"going to this wedding in June\" vs. \"staying home.\" \n\nIf I were you I'd go through the exercise of pretending to plan this out so you REALLY know what's at stake. Price out your travel and hotel, figure out how much time you'd have to take off work and how much you'd lose in wages. You might even ask your supervisor for advice. You could just ask your boss \"I'm in a sticky situation. I'd agreed to be in a wedding party during the summer but they just moved their date to June. The wedding isn't local so I'd have to miss X amount of time from work. I'm not sure if asking for that time off is feasible or if it's totally unrealistic. What do you think?\" Who knows, maybe your supervisor will tell you that they'll work with you to get you the time off; or, they'll tell you that it's a bad idea to even ask. \n\nIf you really want to be there I think you owe it to your friend to seriously investigate your possibilities first. That way you can know \\*for sure\\* that it's not possible to attend and you won't feel like you're just making excuses; or, maybe you'll be able to put in the work to make it happen.", "NTA\n\nHow he responded to you having to back out is a huge red flag. Good thing you didn't go. \n\nYou agreed to a certain date. He's allowed to change it. You're allowed to no longer be able to attend. He is NOT allowed to blow up on you. \n\nI would be seriously considering if this friendship is worth it if he doesn't apologize.", "NTA He is making huge assumptions about your life. Who has a wedding on a Tuesday and expects anyone to attend?", "NTA. Your reasons are valid. He can't ask you to risk getting fired.", "NTA. You're not obligated to attend any wedding, especially not traveling for a Tuesday.\n\n I would consider asking some colleagues who have been through probation already whether it's truly a problem to take 2-3 days off one time. Sometimes they just say that kind of thing to freak you out so you're not taking time off all over the place. He's right that you could probably do this, but you don't have to if it is inconvenient or even if you just don't want to.\n\nI gotta say, I love him referencing Zola. I guess his friends who work non-union mining jobs are exempt from obligatory attendance.", "It's a job. You should be able to take time off for any reason, at any time.\n\nThat said, you're on probation, so your options are limited.\n\nYour hating parties is irrelevant. This is about logistics. And they don't work for you.\n\nHis expectations are flattering but unreasonable. You don't owe him excuses or explanation. \"No\" is a complete sentence.\n\nNTA\n\nYour friendship may have run its course if he's not going to be reasonable and understanding.", "NTA - a real friend wouldn't give you grief in the face of all the issues you have listed.  You agreed to come when it was workable for you and then he moved the goal posts.  If he is this uncaring of the major burden he is asking you to take on, this is a \"friendship\" that you can well do without going forward.", "NTA \n\nHe should be more understanding of the date change from your perspective. But that being said, be prepared for the decision to have a long term impact on your relationship, even if it\u2019s not really your fault.", "NTA. He\u2019s the one that changed the date and you\u2019re giving him plenty of notice, as well as very reasonable reasons, why you cannot attend. He\u2019s simply choosing not to hear you.", "This groomzilla changed the date because the cost of a venue on a Tuesday night far, far, far less than a Saturday. He did it without checking with you. NTA.", "NTA - He is not hearing your concerns because he is focused on himself and his own feelings.  Maybe try and write him a letter - maybe it will sink in a bit better.  Heck, maybe even address the letter to both of them.  How distraught you are he thinks you want to miss the wedding, how much you looked forward to it, to meeting and getting to know her, etc...", "NTA. Who does a ceremony on a Tuesday?", "I understand why you are doing this, you have work.", "NTA. Your reasons are legitimate. The world does not revolve around his wedding. If him and his wife scheduled it on a Tuesday then they should realize a lot of folks won\u2019t be able to make it.", "NTA - He may be upset because of how many people are telling him that they can't make a TUESDAY Wedding?  Inconvenient for EVERYONE.  Tell him HE shouldn't be upset because A) he changed the date and B) HE has six months to find someone else.", "Omg, just stick to your boundaries! You can't take of work, you're not an asshole!\n\nIf you were so, so important to him he would consider your circumstances. But no, he can't fathom why a late night on a Tuesday would be a proplem for anyone, let alone a teacher? Get out of here with that.\n\nGrrrrrr.", "NTA What kind of a person has a wedding on a Tuesday? Especially one that he knows people have to travel from far away to get to? Pretty dumb idea if you ask me.", "NTA for me the problem is the distance AND the day. Who plans a wedding on a Tuesday?! Even if the wedding were in the same city as me I\u2019m not sure I would attend on a Tuesday. I\u2019m guessing part of what he is mad is because you aren\u2019t the only person to say they can\u2019t come. Also, if your friendship can\u2019t survive this then it was already waning.", "I don't know how your financial situation is. If it is really tight I would understand. But if its just because 'it's a lot of money'.. then my answer is, how much is your friendship worth? I assume your best friend only wants to marry once. Since your concerns it does not look like you always take times off for personal reasons. So how badly will it reflect on you as a teacher, taking in account that there is a teachers shortage? You are not an asshole if you have problems making ends meet at the end of the month. But if you are financially comfortable with paying your monthly costs and have some savings. Then yes, it is your best friend and you could assume he would do the same. Altough I do not like his entitlement but I do understand that he is upset.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Yes, it's more awkward, and it's frustrating when dates change, but if I heard \"I'm sorry I can't even afford to try to get off work\" from my BEST friend about my wedding, when they're in the wedding party, I'd be pretty pissed off. Then again, if money really was an issue with my friend, I'd also do my best to be accommodating/help with the cost of clothes and travel. Could you maybe explain that to him? Rather than the days off issue, explain that you genuinely can't afford certain aspects but that you'd still love to go? You're not being an AH, but It's January now, you have more than enough time to explain this to your head of staff.

You have very valid reasons. Second you have every right to change your mind when he changed the circumstances by changing dates. \n\nHe\u2019s not wrong to chose his date, but you\u2019re not wrong for not staying in the wedding party because it does not feasibly work for you. It\u2019s not about you trying to get out of it for petty reasons, you\u2019re backing out because of legit reasons like your career and financial situation. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe him anything and he doesn\u2019t have to like it, but he does have to accept no for an answer. You\u2019re not the bad guy here. He isn\u2019t either for choosing a different date. It\u2019s just a matter of poor timing. \n\nHe is the AH though, for being so nasty. He should have been more understanding and graciously accepted that you can\u2019t put your career and livelihood at risk for his wedding. He\u2019s acting entitled and arrogant to believe that you should risk losing your job for a wedding. \n\nYou\u2019ve given him the same 6 months notice to find someone else to fill your place that he believes is enough notice for you to make arrangements. So if he believes it\u2019s enough time for you to accommodate him, it\u2019s enough for him to make new arrangements.", "NAH\n\nBut it's sad for both of you if you can't attend.\n\nIf it's financial, will your friend subsidise your costs to attend? If he wants you there as much as he says, he may be able to help financially.\n\nAnd even teachers should be allowed leave during term time occasionally - depends on the travel options but you'd be gone presumably a couple of days, not a couple of weeks? Worth talking to your employer and explaining you're the best woman, not just going to a distant cousin's wedding for the food. I'd hope a decent employer would understand that and accept it - they'd have to cover for you if you were ill after all so they can't claim the whole school would shut down due to your absence.

You should not risk your standing with your employer.   Time missed during a probation period sends a big red flag to your employer.   From their perspective, if you can't even manage to get through probation without an absence that is not considered appropriate/approved, why would they expect you to be a reliable employee.", "NAH. Your friend has a right to be upset that you're unable to attend, especially since he's given you six months notice to make arrangements and some of your excuses sound a little thin. \"I can't take off for a wedding because I'm a teacher\" like what? You're allowed to have a personal life. On the other hand, since you have no paid time off and you have budget concerns if you really can't make this work financially your friend should accept that.

You'll take a week off to go, and that's where a week day wedding makes sense.", "Probationary period where I am lasts a year, at least for teachers.", "Maybe your just a bad friend then"]}
