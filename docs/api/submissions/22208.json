Not only will we be in an Airbnb and in a city I don\u2019t know, I would like some time to relax which is one reason I didn\u2019t want to golf.

Now my wife\u2019s sister is mad at both me and my wife, and making back handed comments about it. I know I\u2019m capable of babysitting, though uncomfortable. I also know I\u2019m making it harder for sister-in-law and her husband to do what they want to. I also feel like an asshole because my wife is the one going between the two of us and her sister is now being rude and trying to guilt her about what I\u2019m doing.

Babysitting is not relaxing. Why are SIL's plans more important than your own? NTA", ">My wife\u2019s sister asked her if I would watch her three kids (9, 5, 1) since her and her husband both made plans.\n\nNTA.  Tell your sister-in-law that you also made plans and are not available.  This is not your problem to solve.", "NTA\n\nYou came for a wedding and turned down an event you would have enjoyed (golf) so you could relax.  Note 3 extra kids will not be relaxing.  Especially not one still wearing a diaper.  Have you ever changed diapers before?  \n\nAlso, i can guarantee you that if you agree, they will take advantage and say \"lets have lunch or do X after the pedicure, the kids are.ok and we never get a break from them\" and they would be gone hours.\n\nThey can ask someone else or hire a babysitter.  The hotel or wherever they are staying may have someone they can put them in touch with.", "Question: Originally the plan was for you to go golfing, right? If you had done that, what would SIL have done with the kids?\n\nSIL should know that even though you're not going golfing, you're still unavailable. And go back to her original babysitting plan (that doesn't involve you). Or SIL (and her partner, if there is one, should take turns doing the planned activities so one of them can watch their kids.)\n\nYour wife should support you here. Shut that sh*t down.\n\nNTA but SIL is. And your wife will be an a-hole if she doesn't support you here.\n\nEdited.", "NTA  \n\n\nYour sister-in-law dropped the bomb on your wife last minute, expecting you to jump to the rescue. That's a classic move, conveniently forgetting that you're also entitled to enjoy your well-deserved vacation. So, you're all set for a week of family festivities, but then your sister-in-law drops the bombshell. She wants you to babysit her three precious angels while she enjoys her pedicure. Talk about being put on the spot!\r  \n\r  \nFirst things first, let's acknowledge your desire to kick back and relax during this vacation. We all need some downtime, am I right? It's your vacation too. You have the right to set boundaries and take the time to relax. \r  \n\r  \nKids can be adorable little bundles of joy, but they can also be a whirlwind of chaos. It sounds like you're not exactly thrilled about the prospect of handling four kids, especially with a baby who's just discovered the art of crawling. \r  \n\r  \n\rWhile it might make you feel a tad guilty, remember that you're not the designated family babysitter. So, go on, enjoy your well-deserved break, and let the sister-in-law figure out her own childcare solutions. Cheers to some peaceful relaxation time and avoiding the chaos of four little humans running wild in an Airbnb!\n\nBut let's not forget the sister-in-law drama. Your wife relayed your reluctance to play the role of the all-knowing babysitter, and now the sister-in-law is throwing a tantrum of her own. Canceling the pedicure or bringing all her kids? Drama much? \n\nLife has a way of throwing these unexpected curveballs at us, and sometimes, we need to make compromises. Sure, it's not technically your responsibility to babysit your sister-in-law's brood, and it's your well-deserved time off work. But hey, family dynamics can get complicated, and maintaining peace and harmony is like playing a never-ending game of Jenga. Consider the bigger picture.\n\n\rNow, I'm not saying you should completely abandon your familial duties. You're a responsible stepdad, and you've proven that. But four kids, all by yourself, in an unfamiliar place? That's a whole different ballgame. It's like taking on a marathon when you were only prepared for a light jog. \r  \n\r  \nUltimately, it's not your obligation to play nanny on your vacation. Your sister-in-law should have planned ahead or made alternative arrangements. And hey, if she has to cancel her pedicure or bring her kids along, well, that's a consequence of her last-minute request. You deserve your well-earned downtime, and it's okay to stand your ground.\r  \n\r  \nSo, my vote? Not the asshole. Enjoy your vacation, savor those precious moments of relaxation, and let the sister-in-law handle her own kids for a change.", "NTA. Mad for not doing a favor. How entitled is SIL? Maybe she should have thought about that before making the appointment.", "NTA it\u2019s your holiday and you want to relax. She can get a pedicure anytime. Why does she get to do what she wants on holiday while you are expected to look after her three kids? Pretty outrageous of her really.", "And again an idiot says to do something \u2018to keep the peace\u2019.       \nMaybe tell your wife that your SIL should shut the hell up and look after her own kids if she wants to keep the peace", "NTA  SIL need to relax is no more important than your need to relax. If she doesn't want to take them then she needs to have her own husband take care of them.", "I don't think so. handling three kids just spells chaos, especially given their ages.", "NTA\n\nYou have no obligation to babysit anyone else's kids.  You aren't the asshole for saying \"no\".\n\nBe cautious about the fact that SIL might leave without her kids on that day, or might stay in the accomodations and make your life difficult that day.  My recommendation would be that you take your stepson and leave the accomodations at the same time your wife does.  Do something restful like go to the park and grab an ice cream together... Whatever is restful that you would both enjoy.  Plan to avoid SIL in case she makes trouble.", "Interesting that you never call them your nieces/nephews.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
