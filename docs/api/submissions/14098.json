Your son sucks and is a bully.\n\nI was the target for this kind of \"prank\" a lot in school. You know what happened? I ended up withdrawn, with horrible self esteem, not dating anyone because I was afraid it was a joke too, and getting groomed by a man 5 years older than me because he was the only person who wasn't family who told me I was beautiful and treated me like a women.\n\nI was 14 when he started this. And at 17 he took my virginity, only showing up for the act and leaving right after. Then we spent the next 3 years with a friend's with benefits type relationship. It wasn't until I had the opertunity to move across the country that I realized that was all he was after. A pretty young girl to get his rocks off with. Because no one else in his age group was interested in his alcoholic ass. Another red flag I ignored.\n\nAnd now, because of all of this? I'm in therapy, my self esteem is still horrible but I'm working on it, and even now fricken 2 decades later I still don't believe people when they try to ask me out or hit on me. This kind of shit sticks with you forever after a silly \"prank\" like this.\n\nNext time someone tells you it's just \"boys being boys\" or typical \"teenager jokes\", ask them, would they react this way if someone did this to their daughter? To his sister? To them? Why is it ok when it probably just effected that poor girls entire life?\n\nThis was not a prank. It was basically a cruel hazing your kid was paid to do. That girl needs a genuine apology from him and his friends.

This response was clear enough to send the message that this kind of behavior won't be tolerated, but not so harsh as to alienate him completely.

I\u2019d just like to see the mental gymnastics people try and pull to justify this as a victimless prank.", "NTA-\n\nWhat your son is doing is a game called \"Pigging\" where I'm from.\nYou ask someone who you don't think is attractive out.\nThen you plan to meet them somewhere.\nThen you wait for them to arrive and you don't show up.\nYou ignore messages etc \n\nSometimes they are hiding and take pictures.\n\nIt happened to a  friend of mine, then the guy asked me out (don't know if it was genuine or part of the game), but felt good to tell him where he could go.\n(Far away from me)\n\nYour son and his friends are bullies. They're awful.", "NTA as someone who was asked out by their crush   and multiple other boys as a prank in elementary (luckily i never said yes) it\u2019s extremely hurtful and embarrassing.\n\u201cBoys will be boys\u201d is a terrible mentally. You\u2019re telling me just because someone is a boy, they\u2019re allowed to get away with things? Not right and wife, MIL and FIL are wrong for trying to excuse his behavior", "NTA\n\nWhat was the result of the dare? The way I see it she either says yes and the son has to humiliate her revealing it's a prank (doubt he'd bother actually going on a date and being nice but saying it didn't work out) or she turns him down in which case he's extra humiliated and she's fine. I hope it's the second one but not optimistic.", "How would he feel if that happened to him??? Glad you\u2019re not letting this shit go it\u2019s cruel.", "Boys will be boys? Oh you mean like Brock Turner, right? Your wife and son are abhorrent. No wonder why he doesn\u2019t take this seriously. You are NTA and ask your wife if boys will be boys is okay if some boys sexually assaulted her or were cruel. I simply cannot with your wife\u2019s attitude.", "NTA. Maybe share with your son some of these comments from those of us who got asked out as pranks and what it did to our self esteem. How it hurts for years. \n\nHe's 16, he can learn, although you have your work cut out for you with your extremely unempathetic wife.", "Nta. He's a bully. And your wife is one to", "NTA at all! The fact that he had so many comebacks for you and that wife said it wouldn\u2019t happen to your daughter because she has \u201cgood genes\u201d just goes to show that they somehow feel superior to what they deem unattractive people. I\u2019m so glad you punished him for it, but also really feel like it might not do any good if all his other influences are so strong (mom, friends, gparents, etc). But keep trying to redirect him, you\u2019re a good parent OP.", "\"Boys will be boys\" Is how rape culture happens. Thank you for shutting that shit down.", "it's good you showed him that the prank wasn't just a joke. \"boys will be boys\" is a bogus defense. boys are boys because parents let them be, and if we step in and correct the negative behavior, they could be better. boys aren't naturally destructive and cruel.", "NTA\u2026. But your wife is a total AH. \u201cBoys will be boys\u201d is such a toxic mentality that lets boys get away with hurtful behaviours.", "Someone should remind the wife that even with good genes looks fade. And I don't mean the daughter...", "Nta and I agree with everything others have said. \n\nI hope at the very least you have your wife, and maybe your son read this thread. The bullied are REAL EFFING PEOPLE.", "NTA. I had similar pulled on me in 8th grade. Still remember it like it was recent rather than decades ago. It cursed my dating life for sure. Still have trust issues when it comes to men.", "NTA this isn't a prank that doesn't hurt anyone, it can cause emotional scares\n\nYour wife is an AH tho .....", "NTA. And now you know where your son gets his audacity to act like a bully. \n\nIt\u2019s your wife.", "NTA. The 'boys will be boys' crap is how we end up with entitled and abusive men who think they can do no wrong.", "NTA. I was given an anonymous flower on Valentines. It was a prank from two guys I had known who thought it'd be funny. Anyway, I was pretty hurt and lost trust in anyone having an interest in me for quite a bit because I assumed it'd be another prank. \n\nYour son is really damaging people by doing this, and he doesn't get to say whether the victim feels hurt or not. Good on you for punishing him.", "NTA. I had guys pull the same shit on me from middle school to 11th grade. I just stopped trusting guys at that point and didn't befriend any of them, kept my head down and pretended like they didn't exist. \n\nThe only reason I have my current boyfriend is because I've known him for nearly 3 years and we've been through hell and back together.", "NTA it sounds like you are one of the only people in your son's orbit that has any appreciable degree of empathy and decency. You should look into having a few counseling sessions with him, that might open his eyes to the very real damage that people can do to each other, and why you won't ignore it. It does affect you.", "Seriously\u2026the wife needs to be grounded as well. Absolutely disgusting response she had for OP", "Exactly!! NTA, I am so pleased to see a man standing up for a girl he doesn\u2019t know against his own family. We absolutely need more of this. People need to learn that this behaviour is extremely hurtful for any person. The wife sounds like a total nightmare and the reason toxic expressions like \u201cboys will be boys\u201d still exist. Does she honestly think because her daughter has \u201cgood genes\u201d that no guy will ever do hurtful things to her? I guess when they do she can just shrug it off a say \u201coh well, boys will boys\u201d maybe she will even follow it up with \u201cmaybe if you lost some weight guys would like you more\u201d. Your son is absolutely a bully like this for a reason man, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s you.", "[removed]", "NTA...\n\n>That won\u2019t happen because she has good genes\n\nYour wife is completely missing the point. She is basically saying she doesn't care if it hurts because it only happens to other people.\n\nNo wonder she raised such an asshole...", "I mean there's definitely a possibility that the son didn't realize how hurtful it could be and got it after the conversation.\n\nWife's a total narcissistic nutbar though.\n\nEdit: I just realized the son is 16. Nevermind.", "I was already firmly NTA, and after reading some of the personal anecdotes in this thread, I\u2019ll take it a step farther and say OP ought to _extend_ the grounding until the end of the semester.\n\nThis \u201cprank\u201d can cause _very_ long-term damage. Two weeks hardly seems appropriate.", "\u201cHurting their baby.\u201d Dear god, don\u2019t let the son near women until he unlearns this. And OP should talk to the wife about internalized misogyny. Apparently people only have value if they\u2019re boys or girls with \u201cgood genes.\u201d This is gross.", "NTA. Hopefully OP can teach they're other children empathy since their wife won't.", "Check username he is def the dad", "That was my first thought as well. \n\n\"boys will be boys\"?!?!?!?! WHAT?? it is 2023. That's bullying. \n\nOP is right to talk to and punish son - and good on him. Maybe talk to your wife as well OP, as this seems like something to really be on the same page about.", "This also happened to me in high school. I remember the embarrassment and shame I felt after the \"joke\" was revealed. His friends were laughing in the background of the phone call. It has been 20+ years for me too. I'm saddened by the distinct lack of empathy from everyone in the family except OP.", "Not as a joke, but pity. A \"friend\" asked his friend to ask me out so I could kiss for the first time. It didn't even happen as I excused myself when she approached me, but almost 15 years later and I still remember and resent him for that", "I was asked out as a \u2018prank\u2019 by a guy I liked when I was 13 years old. We had been \u201cclose friends\u201d, and I had thought he genuinely liked me. It destroyed my confidence. It\u2019s not a harmless joke. It\u2019s followed me into my 20\u2019s, and will likely follow me for years to come. \n\nNTA, OP. Please don\u2019t back down.", "Thank you for responding so honestly - I was going to say all the other non-bullied responses don\u2019t matter. Take the word of the bullied - FUCK them, they intentionally hurt people they deem as unworthy and think that\u2019s ok. Borderline psychopathic (a complete lack of empathy for the victim) thinking must go into that mindset.", "For real - now we know where sonny boy gets the implicit permission that it's okay to make fun of unattractive people.", "Ugly people aren\u2019t people. Just ask the wife.", "Exhibit A: OPs wife who thinks this shit is \"harmless\". I wonder if she did it to someone when she was in high school....\n\n\nNTA", "I overheard a group of boys chittering about trying to pull this prank on me. So when I was approached I already had my dead stare on. I put an end to it quickly and it was anticlimactic for them...\n\nBut I still was hurt and never took any male interest seriously for many years to come, fearful that I would have the same trick pulled again, but successfully.\n\nBullies should be forced to wear a sign with a list of their \"pranks\". Let a little public humiliation for their own actions follow them for a short while.", "Why did my sons put their butts together and try to fart simultaneously? Boys will be boys.", "> Why did my son come home with holes in his pants\u2019 knees and covered in mud\n\nMy daughters do that too. You could simply say \"kids will be kids\", but \"boys will be boys\" DOES imply that certain behaviours are acceptable, but only for boys.", "According to OP's wife, ugly people basically earn the pranks pulled on them so yeah, I'm betting kiddo doesn't see the girl in question as a person.", "Exactly.", "No, it implies that those behaviors spawn from the fact that the child is a boy. That was my whole point. \u201cBoys will be boys\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily excuse the behavior, it explains why the behavior occurred. Discipline may be necessary after that, or maybe it won\u2019t. It\u2019s a situational thing.", "Happened to me in high school. Can confirm my hatred for those asshats still burns with the heat of a thousand suns. 40 years ago.", "Yep. Force them to apologize + tell the girl to reach out if they EVER do this again. A lot of bullied teens will keep it to themselves after one incident to avoid escalation and confrontation. OP please her to speak up and let you know if your son does this again. Unacceptable.", "If I was the girl I would not want that happen in the school. Everyone would be talking about it and it would make it worse", "Im not saying a public apology or anything like that as I wouldn\u2019t want more attention drawn to the girl but I\u2019d let the school know about the bullying issue and whether it be personal or just around school officials he needs to apologize to her."]}
