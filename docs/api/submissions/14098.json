Your son sucks and is a bully.\n\nI was the target for this kind of \"prank\" a lot in school. You know what happened? I ended up withdrawn, with horrible self esteem, not dating anyone because I was afraid it was a joke too, and getting groomed by a man 5 years older than me because he was the only person who wasn't family who told me I was beautiful and treated me like a women.\n\nI was 14 when he started this. And at 17 he took my virginity, only showing up for the act and leaving right after. Then we spent the next 3 years with a friend's with benefits type relationship. It wasn't until I had the opertunity to move across the country that I realized that was all he was after. A pretty young girl to get his rocks off with. Because no one else in his age group was interested in his alcoholic ass. Another red flag I ignored.\n\nAnd now, because of all of this? I'm in therapy, my self esteem is still horrible but I'm working on it, and even now fricken 2 decades later I still don't believe people when they try to ask me out or hit on me. This kind of shit sticks with you forever after a silly \"prank\" like this.\n\nNext time someone tells you it's just \"boys being boys\" or typical \"teenager jokes\", ask them, would they react this way if someone did this to their daughter? To his sister? To them? Why is it ok when it probably just effected that poor girls entire life?\n\nThis was not a prank. It was basically a cruel hazing your kid was paid to do. That girl needs a genuine apology from him and his friends.

This response was clear enough to send the message that this kind of behavior won't be tolerated, but not so harsh as to alienate him completely.

Being a teenager/teen girl is hard enough without having some boys trashing your appearance on top of it.", "NTA. That kind of \"prank\" really messes people up and is extremely vile to pull on anyone. Would your wife still say \"oh boys will be boys\" if he went and did something worse?
