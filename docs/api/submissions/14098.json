Your son sucks and is a bully.\n\nI was the target for this kind of \"prank\" a lot in school. You know what happened? I ended up withdrawn, with horrible self esteem, not dating anyone because I was afraid it was a joke too, and getting groomed by a man 5 years older than me because he was the only person who wasn't family who told me I was beautiful and treated me like a women.\n\nI was 14 when he started this. And at 17 he took my virginity, only showing up for the act and leaving right after. Then we spent the next 3 years with a friend's with benefits type relationship. It wasn't until I had the opertunity to move across the country that I realized that was all he was after. A pretty young girl to get his rocks off with. Because no one else in his age group was interested in his alcoholic ass. Another red flag I ignored.\n\nAnd now, because of all of this? I'm in therapy, my self esteem is still horrible but I'm working on it, and even now fricken 2 decades later I still don't believe people when they try to ask me out or hit on me. This kind of shit sticks with you forever after a silly \"prank\" like this.\n\nNext time someone tells you it's just \"boys being boys\" or typical \"teenager jokes\", ask them, would they react this way if someone did this to their daughter? To his sister? To them? Why is it ok when it probably just effected that poor girls entire life?\n\nThis was not a prank. It was basically a cruel hazing your kid was paid to do. That girl needs a genuine apology from him and his friends.

This response was clear enough to send the message that this kind of behavior won't be tolerated, but not so harsh as to alienate him completely.

That kind of \"prank\" really messes people up and is extremely vile to pull on anyone. Would your wife still say \"oh boys will be boys\" if he went and did something worse?

Your wife is terrible. Nta. And I hope your son actually learns not to be an ass", "I am sad for the girl. I sympathize so much. I hope they do not go thru with it. Are you reporting to the school?", "Back to back posts I\u2019ve read where the mothers excused their son\u2019s horrible behaviour towards women as \u201cboys will be boys\u201d mentally.\n\nAs a mother to a boy, this is just beyond anything\u2026..disgusting and disrespectful. \n\nKudos to you! Your definitely NTA. Thank your for parenting this way!", "NTA.  \nYour wife is SHALLOW. Not only that she sounds like the kind of person who will enable toxic behavior from your son because he's a boy. She might be someone you love but I'm sorry, OP, she's got a twisted mentality", "NTA at all. It's not harmless and overhearing something is not eavesdropping. I salute you for being a good father and your wife etc. are disgraceful.", "NTA. Your wife sounds like a selfish idiot. Thank you for trying to save that poor girl pain.", "NTA. Sit this little shit down and make him watch Carrie", "NTA\nAsking someone out as a prank is cruel.", "NTA. That is quite the opposite of a \"harmless\" prank, as evidenced by your cousin who had long-lasting emotional and relational issues because of a similar prank.\n\nGood on you for holding your son to a higher standard. We need that.", "NTA. Your son\u2019s behavior is horrid and he\u2019s hurting an innocent person.", "You might have a further discussion on pranks in general. I may be a bit biased, as I generally find them abhorrent. But I would ask him to think about where the humor stems from in a prank. Does he really want to be the kind of person who gets his enjoyment from the embarrassment, shame and/or humiliation of other people?", ">\u201cboys will be boys\u201d\n\nBoys will be ~~boys~~ will be held responsible for their actions. His actions are only normal for bullies.\n\nNTA, but your wife, our son, and his friends are.", "NTA. And if they have to resort to \"boys will be boys\", they know that it is not entirely ok. Just because it might be considered \"normal\" it does not mean that it should be allowed. \"Separate but equal\" used to be normal too but thankfully people stood up against that old adage too. Keep holding your son up to standards that require him to treat others the way they should be treated, not like toys for him to damage or break as he chooses.", "\"Boys will be boys\" encourages toxic masculinity.", "Boys will NOT be boys. They will be the bullshit behavior they are taught and whatever they\u2019re never reprimanded for. I really hate all of that entire saying. NTA and someone failed your wife into believing this load of crap.", "\"Boys will be boys\" means theyre going to pick their nose and rub it on walls and scrape their knees while slinging mudpies and comparing armpit hair and armpit farts\n\nIt DOES not mean that you enable bullies\n\nNTA", "NTA.  You are fighting a war to raise your son and daughter to hold your family shared values and ideals. This is one battle you need to win.  Might lose others but not this one.  Treat people with respect or lose the last name and the privileges that come with what I gave you. Keep fighting", "NTA if I were you I would make your son take her out on date. Only for that fact he need to learn she\u2019s a person to. With thoughts and feelings, and humanize her in his eyes. I\u2019m not saying it would work but I would be like nah fam your going to do you what said and keep your word. But as typing this could see how it could make worse. So like do take my advice. But man your wife needs a reality check. Cause that can happen to anyone my guy", "NTA, \"BWBB\" is a sentence that has been ruining young women's lives since it's conception.", "NTA. You're a good dad.", "NTA", "NTA", "Who the hell did you marry??? (NTA)", "Your wife is a problem huh", "NTA - your son is a bully and your wife sounds shallow and like she would've encouraged it if she was in high school because she's deemed other women lesser than \ud83d\ude43", "NTA. Geez another misogynistic mom here, what a surprise. Way to educate kids, go dad!", "NTA \u201cBoys will be boys\u201d is a load crock of shit and biggest cop out in the history of excuses to not take responsibility for one\u2019s actions.", "NTA you\u2019re a good dad and a good person. I hope you find a way to get through to him. I know it\u2019s hard but you are 100% right and you don\u2019t have to wonder about that.", "NTA. Boys will be boys is such a toxic saying. Shame on your wife for that comment. Your son is a bully. If he goes thru with this \u201cprank\u201d (cruel trick) it will 100% ruin this innocent young lady\u2019s self esteem, confidence etc. Stand firm!", "NTA and I would let your wife see all of these comments about how awful her comments were. If she is letting him get away with this kind of behavior a lot, I would not be surprised if your son continued this and other terrible behavior into his adult life. You are doing the right thing by teaching him this is unacceptable, but if your wife is letting it be known that she doesn't agree with your decision to your son, then he will likely think you are a dick and this behavior is totally fine.", "NTA. Good on you for parenting him on this unlike your wife.", "He is still a minor and you are his parent so it does have something to do with you. Furthermore he is not pulling a prank. He is bullying a peer. I\u2019m sensing enabling behavior from your wife and in-laws. You\u2019re NTA. I don\u2019t know how useful grounding is but another user asked if y\u2019all have ever seen Carrie and grounding or not that might be a place to start with your son.", "Nta. Have you and your family seen the film \u201cCarrie\u201d with sissy spacek? If not, you should.", "I got asked out as a prank in highschool. I was a chubby and shy kid and didn't consider myself at all attractive, so when a guy I had once had a huge crush on asked me out, I was elated and accepted. That's when I heard the snickering. I realized that a huddle of his friends were stood at the other side of the room, trying and failing to hold back their laughter. He started laughing and said he was just kidding and would never go out with me. He and his friends might not have taken it \"too far\", but that shit still affected me for years to come.\n\nYour son is a bully, and your wife's defense of \"boys will be boys\" is complete bullshit, she's just enabling his bad behavior. If you don't punish him for this, he will continue to do shit like this to bully and humiliate people. Stand your ground and punish him accordingly.\n\nNTA", "Well since your wife is into pranks you should pull one with your daughter and have her tell her mom someone pulled the same prank on her and see what mom says. Or have a pretty girl from your son's class ask him out as a prank and see how he feels. But that's just me being petty. NTA by the way. I don't ever see how prank asking someone out is harmless.\n\nIt seems like you understand it better because you saw how it affected someone close to you. Until your wife and or son can see how it affects someone close to them, they will not understand the consequences of his actions.", "Normal teenage behavior? Sadly, yes. But teaching him how to treat others and enforcing boundaries makes you NTA.", "Dogfight was so good!", "Agreed.  As someone who was asked out as a prank and still has scars from it 20+ years later, NTA.  OP, this is not a harmless joke.  I guarantee the girl that he was talking about won\u2019t find it funny.  Please, please don\u2019t back down.", "The wife definitely sounds like the type to do this prank to a guy", "Also people dont realize what \"boys will be boys\" escalates into as grown men. What kind of man is your wife raising him to be if she condones him treating a girl this way? How does she think he's about to treat women?", "Not to mention this isnt just a boy thing, mean girls do it too. Making a classmate feel like no one would actually want to go out with them, where's the funny part? \nIt's a bully thing plain and simple.", "Dude, my cats name is Major Tom.", "Yes, how could the son say that this prank wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone?  Does the girl he literally hurt not count as a person? You are a good parent for trying to make hi. See this as mean thing to do.  Could her apologize to the girl he hurt?

She is also very, very shy (although this has improved now that she is older and in university). She is the type of person who has a very small friend group and has always been this way. Her first day of middle school (in a new district, we moved our younger 5 to a different district because of the bullying my daughter had at her old elementary school, and the older 4 wanted to transfer because of more opportunities at the new district) one of the pretty \"mean girls\" decided to start picking on her. It was pretty much like that until she graduated. All because she is quiet and shy. \n\nWife sounds like a typical mean girl. FIL probably encouraged her mean behaviors by making excuses for it like the wife is doing with the son. The son is old enough to know better. OP seems like the only one with any compassion in this post. NTA", "My \"best\" friend pulled a prank like that on me in 4th grade. Fifty plus years later I still hate her guts for it. It ruined my dating years because my self confidence was destroyed at 9 years old.", "I would\u2019ve also gone to the school and found the girl to force him to apologize. This is cruel and incidents like this have left kids suicidal."]}
