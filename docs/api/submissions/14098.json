Asking someone out on a prank is hurtful bullying and can destroy a person's self esteem. Not exaggerating that teenagers have suicided due to being the victim in situations like this.

That's how being grounded works. I was grounded for skipping school. My parents had nothing to do with that. \n\n>MIL and FIL are blowing up the family group chat about how I\u2019m hurting their baby for normal teenage boy behaviour\n\nTell them to grow up.

Maybe it will change his view to see how much harm it can cause.", "NTA. That\u2019s disgusting and cruel behavior by your son and disgusting responses from your wife. I\u2019m horrified by this post.", "NTA oh my gosh thank you for trying to raise your son to be respectful to young girls. How far would she allow that boys will be boys attitude? Would she or your son want a boy to pull this crap on your daughter one day?", "nta. in high school i was that girl that was asked out as a prank (a few different times). its one of the few things i vividly remember from high school. it was devastating knowing that i was not only ugly, but ugly enough to be used like that. on some level the boys that did that to me did not process that i was a human being with a heart and that it would break under those circumstances. they saw me as \u201cless than\u201d and unworthy of basic decency. you\u2019re a good father for calling out that kind of behavior and you should absolutely stand your ground. i promise that the girl on the other end of it would appreciate it, even if she never knows about it.", "NTA. Your son sucks and is a bully.\n\nI was the target for this kind of \"prank\" a lot in school. You know what happened? I ended up withdrawn, with horrible self esteem, not dating anyone because I was afraid it was a joke too, and getting groomed by a man 5 years older than me because he was the only person who wasn't family who told me I was beautiful and treated me like a women.\n\nI was 14 when he started this. And at 17 he took my virginity, only showing up for the act and leaving right after. Then we spent the next 3 years with a friend's with benefits type relationship. It wasn't until I had the opertunity to move across the country that I realized that was all he was after. A pretty young girl to get his rocks off with. Because no one else in his age group was interested in his alcoholic ass. Another red flag I ignored.\n\nAnd now, because of all of this? I'm in therapy, my self esteem is still horrible but I'm working on it, and even now fricken 2 decades later I still don't believe people when they try to ask me out or hit on me. This kind of shit sticks with you forever after a silly \"prank\" like this.\n\nNext time someone tells you it's just \"boys being boys\" or typical \"teenager jokes\", ask them, would they react this way if someone did this to their daughter? To his sister? To them? Why is it ok when it probably just effected that poor girls entire life?\n\nThis was not a prank. It was basically a cruel hazing your kid was paid to do. That girl needs a genuine apology from him and his friends. But since I doubt that'll ever happen, grounding him to make him understand what he did was horrible it as good as you're gonna get.", "NTA. I was on the end of one of these in high school and it did hurt me. Your wife, son and in-laws are all wrong. Thank you for sticking up for that girl.", "NTA.

As someone who was once an unattractive teenage girl I can say that a prank like that could really hurt. It probably made her feel really bad about herself which doesn't take much at that age. In the future she could close herself off to the possibility of a relationship because she won't believe she is good enough/deserving. \n\nAs far as I'm concerned, intervening in this situation makes you a good parent.

I know all too well what it's like to be on the receiving end of mean jokes like this one. \"It's a prank\" is never a sufficient justification for intentionally hurting someone, and \"boys will be boys\" is sexist nonsense that excuses hurtful and misogynistic behavior and ultimately sets up for \"locker room talk\" and \"she was 'asking for it'\" type narratives in the future. This response was clear enough to send the message that this kind of behavior won't be tolerated, but not so harsh as to alienate him completely.
