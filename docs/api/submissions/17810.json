I am the helper, the one who will take care of my father (63 m) when he had open heart surgery, but when I was pregnant with gestational diabetes and preeclampsia I was in the hospital for a week and he came for an hour. He needed someone to watch his kids when he divorced his wife and no one else would, even though when I was a homeless teen he was like oh well that sucks and didn't help me. \n\nAnytime I've asked for help, I have pool league, I have to work honey or I'm going fishing. And me being the doormat like I am, I just say it's ok Dad, I understand or ok that's ok. But the past few months it's gotten worse and I am so sick of it, but I am honestly so scared to hurt his or anyones feelings and I don't know why. Everyone I have ever loved hurts me, my mom, my siblings (25 f and 28m), my in-laws and even people I thought were friends. So I isolate myself, I focus on my Husband (36 m), kid (9 f) and BFF (32 m) and his mom/my adopted mom (61 f). \n\nI do have adhd, I know I can be blunt, but only when others are being hurt, like my dad hurting my siblings or my kids feelings. He only talks to me when it's on his terms. Anyways I've been asking about coming to his house to go swimming and I've asked one of my siblings to hangout multiple times and I keep getting blown off. \n\nWell today (and this has happened multiple times before) I went on FB and I see a pic of all my siblings, my Dad and his Ex- stepdaughter and her son swimming. No phone call or text to see if I wanted to come over. I know if I say anything he will say Oh I didn't know honey, I didn't know if you would want to come over while ex-stepsister is here...I've never had an issue with her, but its like he always picks her over me.\n\n Idk if it's bc I don't drink or smoke pot, but that stuff doesn't bother me. I am hurt, I'm sick of being an after thought, my birthday is next week and no one has asked me anything about it, but he has asked me to take care of him when he gets his spine worked on next month. And my siblings anytime I ask them to hangout, nothing. I've asked them before and they either say busy, no money or ghost me. \n\nI've asked if I need to change, my therapist says I should cut them out, my husband says let it blow over and my BFF and his mom say fuck 'em and rip them a new one. I am hurt and sick of being treated like this. But I don't want to hurt people, I know I can cut with my words and I don't want my daughter to suffer.\n\n So WIBTAH if I texted my family and told them how I feel, I am sick of me, my husband and my kid being left out, and only wanting things from me? Also idk what to say without just being blunt. IDK sorry and thank you!\n\n*Edited to add ages and I misspelled picks* -_-\n\n** Thank you all for your comments and support! You have all given me something to think more on before I act. I think what broke me was when I saw the post at my BFF's house while him and my kid were playing video games and i stared to ugly sob( not me I am the strong one that doesn't break so others can). My kid picked up my phone, saw the post and got mad at my dad and siblings. I don't like her knowing any family drama bc she is so young and I like them to come to their own conclusions about life and i failed them in that. She just held me, like a 9 year old holding me while I cried. I'm crying thinking about that. My job is to comfort and protect her and she held me.", "created_utc": 1684649799, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13nkur2/wibtah_if_i_confronted_my_family_about_leaving_me/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, texting them won\u2019t change anything. \n\nListen to your therapist. Go no contact and focus on the people who do think about you, care about you, and make time for you. \n\nI think for your mental health, you should block all their numbers and block them all on social media. You could do it after you text them but I doubt the text will make any difference. Don\u2019t unblock them until you are indifferent to them.", "YWNBTA But honestly aren't you treating yourself worse than they're treating you? You're disrespecting yourself more by allowing them to take advantage of you despite them treating you badly multiple times. You know better. \n\nIf you think confronting them will help by all means, do so. But they'll probably act like you're being sensitive and claim that's why they don't include you. Or that you're imagining it. \nI'd block all their socials and when your dad tries to ask why you aren't taking care of him just tell him he's called the wrong number and hang up. These arent your people. They have benefitted your life in no way. If they aren't there your life will only improve tremendously. Stop. Instead of taking care of them, take care of you.", "NTA. I suggest writing out all the key points. Also be prepared for the backlash or gaslighting. So far they\u2019ve only shown that they only want you in their lives if when they need you to do something.

If they're so oblivious to your feelings and how awful they are to you and your husband and kid then fuck them, cut them off!\n\nAlso, don't accept any bullshit apology they try when they suddenly need you for something. If they apologise and don't ask you for anything for maybe a month then perhaps consider it. If they apologise because they immediately want something from you then that's not an apology.", "NTA. As a fellow \u201cforgotten one\u201d, I feel your pain. But I would go about it in a different way-just stop returning their calls when they ask you to do something. Stop being the \u201creliable one\u201d. Invest in the relationships you care about i.e. your husband, kid, BFF and MIL. Because the thing is if you write that email, they won\u2019t even care and that will just hurt more. My only other advice is that as someone who is similarly ignored I used to do a lot of soul searching to understand why I didn\u2019t matter-but that\u2019s pointless-there is really no rhyme or reason to it when it comes to family relationships.", "YWNBTA, but don't waste your precious energy or alllow them another opportunity to pick away at you by attempting to explain why you're dropping contact.\n\nJust.  Drop contact.\n\nWrite everything down--the stuff you wrote here and the other stuff you didn't want to write out.  Keep one copy for reference in case your own guilt nudges you back toward them or they start trying to suck you back into the old pattern.  And burn one copy if it helps you feel like you're starting over without them dragging you down.", "YWNBTA\n\n**Care never reciprocated means you're being taken advantage of.**\n\n\nText them how you feel. \nTheir reply will determine the outcome of your relationship.\nIt'll never be your fault if you cut them from your life for good.", "You've been seeking validation from people who only acknowledge you when they need someone to do all the grunt work while they fuck off and have fun. Do you not realize how this makes your chosen family feel like you don't see them as enough? That you keep on going back to your birth family repeatedly, only to get snubbed and deliberately left out each time? Your chosen family *loves you* and treats you well, and you keep trying to find acceptance with blood members who honestly don't give you a second's thought.\n\nLove yourself more than that. You are worth more than being your blood family's indentured slave. You have a loving husband, children, and friends (and adopted mother), so why do you keep trying to find validation from people who honestly don't care if you exist unless it's to benefit them? None of us can choose how we came into this world, but we can always choose our next steps, our futures, and to live our best even with the weights we may carry. \n\nI have gone no contact with people who have repeatedly hurt me. For a few, it was easy, but for others, it was so damn hard to just stop all contact. You might feel like you will inevitably cave and talk to them again, but resisting the urge (much like an alcoholic who struggles with sobriety) can give you confidence that you can truly do better and live lighter without their presence. I don't think sending them a final message will be necessary; your silence should be loud and clear regarding your intentions. If it will give you peace, I would suggest doing it en masse, then blocking every contact immediately afterwards. I hope you can find the peace and love you so wholeheartedly deserve.\n\n\nNTA", "YWNBTA. i would comment on his fb post by saying \"thanks for the invite dad.

These people need to know the effect they have on your mental health. And their shitty attitudes mean that they deserve to be cut off.  You don\u2019t need to change, because it sounds like you have more sense than any of them!", "NTA. Please listen to your therapist. Do yourself a favour and cut them off. Go no contact. You have people in your life who love and support you and your biological family is not it. You deserve better than them and you have people in your life who do treat you better.

If what you say to them is the truth and it hurts them then that is their problem because sometimes the truth hurts.\n\nIf this were me I wouldn't be taking care of him after his surgery either! One of the others can do it.\n\nYou need to listen to your therapist!.. Cut them off because they're not serving you anything but pain... Be kinder to yourself and remove them from your life until they can learn to stop using you like a maid, childminder and nurse.", "NTA \nI would probably go no contact and match their efforts.

And you may want to learn the art of gray rock in your technique of communication with them (google it but basically you become boring like a gray rock and don't give them any information about your life or offer any opinions).\n\nFocus on your family and the people that care for you and support you.

The text I mean.\n\nThe only thing that will do something is a change in your own behaviour, because that is the only thing you can change.\n\nThe issue with the text is that it will appear to do something as it will result in an immediate response. There will be a big fuss of some kind, and words will be said. It will give all appearances of doing \u201csomething\u201d. But then it will pass and as the behaviours on both sides will remain the same, you will inevitably do to much and they will do to little. Like two opposing forces, this is where you have settled.\n\nYou probably don\u2019t have to go no contact if you don\u2019t want to.  Just change your behaviour to do what you genuinely want to do and see what that feels like.  You probably do not want to take care of your dad next month? So cancel. Politely, briefly, firmly cancel by letting him know that you unfortunately (for him) are know longer available.  He will have to make other arrangements. Continue this way until you are only doing things for others that you freely want to do. \n\nSee where you end up then.
