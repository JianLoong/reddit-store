And me being the doormat like I am, I just say it's ok Dad, I understand or ok that's ok. But the past few months it's gotten worse and I am so sick of it, but I am honestly so scared to hurt his or anyones feelings and I don't know why. Everyone I have ever loved hurts me, my mom, my siblings (25 f and 28m), my in-laws and even people I thought were friends. So I isolate myself, I focus on my Husband (36 m), kid (9 f) and BFF (32 m) and his mom/my adopted mom (61 f). \n\nI do have adhd, I know I can be blunt, but only when others are being hurt, like my dad hurting my siblings or my kids feelings. He only talks to me when it's on his terms. Anyways I've been asking about coming to his house to go swimming and I've asked one of my siblings to hangout multiple times and I keep getting blown off. \n\nWell today (and this has happened multiple times before) I went on FB and I see a pic of all my siblings, my Dad and his Ex- stepdaughter and her son swimming. No phone call or text to see if I wanted to come over. I know if I say anything he will say Oh I didn't know honey, I didn't know if you would want to come over while ex-stepsister is here...I've never had an issue with her, but its like he always picks her over me.\n\n Idk if it's bc I don't drink or smoke pot, but that stuff doesn't bother me. I am hurt, I'm sick of being an after thought, my birthday is next week and no one has asked me anything about it, but he has asked me to take care of him when he gets his spine worked on next month. And my siblings anytime I ask them to hangout, nothing. I've asked them before and they either say busy, no money or ghost me. \n\nI've asked if I need to change, my therapist says I should cut them out, my husband says let it blow over and my BFF and his mom say fuck 'em and rip them a new one. I am hurt and sick of being treated like this.

Also idk what to say without just being blunt. IDK sorry and thank you!\n\n*Edited to add ages and I misspelled picks* -_-\n\n** Thank you all for your comments and support! You have all given me something to think more on before I act. I think what broke me was when I saw the post at my BFF's house while him and my kid were playing video games and i stared to ugly sob( not me I am the strong one that doesn't break so others can). My kid picked up my phone, saw the post and got mad at my dad and siblings. I don't like her knowing any family drama bc she is so young and I like them to come to their own conclusions about life and i failed them in that. She just held me, like a 9 year old holding me while I cried. I'm crying thinking about that.

Or that you're imagining it. \nI'd block all their socials and when your dad tries to ask why you aren't taking care of him just tell him he's called the wrong number and hang up.

Your chosen family *loves you* and treats you well, and you keep trying to find acceptance with blood members who honestly don't give you a second's thought.\n\nLove yourself more than that. You are worth more than being your blood family's indentured slave. You have a loving husband, children, and friends (and adopted mother), so why do you keep trying to find validation from people who honestly don't care if you exist unless it's to benefit them?

For a few, it was easy, but for others, it was so damn hard to just stop all contact. You might feel like you will inevitably cave and talk to them again, but resisting the urge (much like an alcoholic who struggles with sobriety) can give you confidence that you can truly do better and live lighter without their presence. I don't think sending them a final message will be necessary; your silence should be loud and clear regarding your intentions.

You have your own family now. \n\nAnd the next time they ask for something, give them the last excuse they gave you and end the conversation. \n\nNTA", "Just block their socials. It\u2019s only necessary to block numbers if someone is harassing you or affecting you. They\u2019re nonexistent. And maybe they\u2019ll notice she\u2019s withdrawn and actually change their behavior.", "You don't have a family. I'm sorry if that hurts, but the way they treat you shows it abundantly.\n\nActually, I should clarify. You don't have a family in them, but you clearly have a family and your husband, your child, and your in-laws. Invest in them, put your time where it is valued, put your energy where it is reciprocated. \n\nThink about what behavior you are modeling for your daughter. The way you act now will set the standard for how she expects other people to treat her.", "> would have been so left field for me!\n\nThat's why you need to do it. Signal that things have changed.", "YWNBTA - I say write them a long text or email and Be honest. I\u2019ve always struggled with why assholes can say what they want and we just have to suck it up but if we DARE think about saying how we feel we\u2019re told not to bc it might cause issues or friction- they don\u2019t care about our feelings so why SHOULDNT we be honest about how it makes us feel?\n\nBe honest. Be blunt. Say your truth. Then maybe go NC for a while like your therapist says. They\u2019ve caused the issues not you. It\u2019s on THEM to heal the relationship. \n\nI deeply empathise and understand your situation - been in it too many times to count and it hurts. Don\u2019t allow them to continue to hurt you bb. You deserve peace love and healing \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA.", "OP, I'm going to be blunt with you. \n\nStop abusing your daughter. \n\nYou're so obsessed with being a saviour and winning the approval of a family that doesn't give a damn about you, that you've trained your pre-teen child into being your emotional caregiver. Now decide what you want: Congratulations on perpetuating the cycle of abuse, perhaps? Or breaking the cycle of abuse? The choice is yours. \n\nYou're already in therapy. Work harder on breaking your addiction to daddy's approval, and protect your child from yourself.", "You obviously love swimming - find another outlet for it and get off of FB.  They are knowingly leaving you out for whatever reason.  NC for a good long period is key.  NTA.", "Fuck them. They are adults let them sort their shit themselves. Go NC and be happier, with you husband child and friends that appreciate you.", "As a retired therapist, I agree with what is posted.  Any text you write will simply be you venting your emotions but it most likely will not change anyone's perceptions, including your own.  If people are taking advantage of your generosity and ethics, and not including you in group activities, it is time to pull back and do a personal inventory of the good that is happening in your life right now, without them.  You are a solid individual who is feeling the loss of being excluded from people you think should include you.  As they are not, you can chose to find things to do without them or you can stay where you are, hoping that they will.  Many people believe that family \"should\" be close and do things together- the reality is, many do not.  I am truly saddened to her that this is happening to you but as you do have a support network in place, use it, and try to slowly let go of the people who have already moved on from you.", "I would say don't text. One scenario is they respond positively but it is all a ruse to get OP \"back on their side\". So things look different for a short time but then go back to normal.", "The text can make difference in how OP feels. Eventually, telling it and standing for yourself can be quite empowering . If OP does not do that with goal of changing them but instead with a goal of making stand, it can feel good.", "Preach!", "This! Don't text or email them how you feel, OP. Just block them and don't respond the few times they do reach out. Tell Dad you're not available to help him after this surgery next month as it sounds like you've already agreed to it but otherwise just go silent.", "Age doesn\u2019t always matter.", "It's necessary for her mental health. She needs to block their numbers too or she may backslide.", "Sweetheart, if you are the only one putting the work in then that isn't a family. It may be people you share blood with but that isn't a family.", "YWNBTA. But don\u2019t do it. Same situation as you. I feel like emergency services at times, or a plumber, or mold remediator, or whatever they need. You gotta cut them out because they have already demonstrated a lack of care. Talking really means nothing anymore\u2026 only actions. It\u2019s up to them now.", "YWNBTA\n\nTeach your daughter how to stand up for herself by letting her see you stand up for yourself.  Teach by actions.  Let her see that the actions of your family are not right and she has options when someone treats her that way. Ghost them and when they call then continue to ghost them.  Do not give them power over the happiness of your family and teach your daughter that it is okay to remove toxic people from your life no matter who they are.  Your whole family with be happier.", "NTA\n\nBut\n\nI don't think a long dramatic text helps it makes it dramatic and puts them on the defensive. \n\nI think you just stop. Stop helping. And tell them, oh sorry, I'm just not available bc you've made it clear you don't really value me you just use me so I'm taking space bc it bothers me."]}
