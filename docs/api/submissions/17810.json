And me being the doormat like I am, I just say it's ok Dad, I understand or ok that's ok. But the past few months it's gotten worse and I am so sick of it, but I am honestly so scared to hurt his or anyones feelings and I don't know why. Everyone I have ever loved hurts me, my mom, my siblings (25 f and 28m), my in-laws and even people I thought were friends. So I isolate myself, I focus on my Husband (36 m), kid (9 f) and BFF (32 m) and his mom/my adopted mom (61 f). \n\nI do have adhd, I know I can be blunt, but only when others are being hurt, like my dad hurting my siblings or my kids feelings. He only talks to me when it's on his terms. Anyways I've been asking about coming to his house to go swimming and I've asked one of my siblings to hangout multiple times and I keep getting blown off. \n\nWell today (and this has happened multiple times before) I went on FB and I see a pic of all my siblings, my Dad and his Ex- stepdaughter and her son swimming. No phone call or text to see if I wanted to come over. I know if I say anything he will say Oh I didn't know honey, I didn't know if you would want to come over while ex-stepsister is here...I've never had an issue with her, but its like he always picks her over me.\n\n Idk if it's bc I don't drink or smoke pot, but that stuff doesn't bother me. I am hurt, I'm sick of being an after thought, my birthday is next week and no one has asked me anything about it, but he has asked me to take care of him when he gets his spine worked on next month. And my siblings anytime I ask them to hangout, nothing. I've asked them before and they either say busy, no money or ghost me. \n\nI've asked if I need to change, my therapist says I should cut them out, my husband says let it blow over and my BFF and his mom say fuck 'em and rip them a new one. I am hurt and sick of being treated like this. But I don't want to hurt people, I know I can cut with my words and I don't want my daughter to suffer.\n\n So WIBTAH if I texted my family and told them how I feel, I am sick of me, my husband and my kid being left out, and only wanting things from me? Also idk what to say without just being blunt. IDK sorry and thank you!\n\n*Edited to add ages and I misspelled picks* -_-\n\n** Thank you all for your comments and support! You have all given me something to think more on before I act. I think what broke me was when I saw the post at my BFF's house while him and my kid were playing video games and i stared to ugly sob( not me I am the strong one that doesn't break so others can). My kid picked up my phone, saw the post and got mad at my dad and siblings. I don't like her knowing any family drama bc she is so young and I like them to come to their own conclusions about life and i failed them in that. She just held me, like a 9 year old holding me while I cried. I'm crying thinking about that. My job is to comfort and protect her and she held me.", "created_utc": 1684649799, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13nkur2/wibtah_if_i_confronted_my_family_about_leaving_me/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or that you're imagining it. \nI'd block all their socials and when your dad tries to ask why you aren't taking care of him just tell him he's called the wrong number and hang up.

Your chosen family *loves you* and treats you well, and you keep trying to find acceptance with blood members who honestly don't give you a second's thought.\n\nLove yourself more than that. You are worth more than being your blood family's indentured slave. You have a loving husband, children, and friends (and adopted mother), so why do you keep trying to find validation from people who honestly don't care if you exist unless it's to benefit them?

For a few, it was easy, but for others, it was so damn hard to just stop all contact. You might feel like you will inevitably cave and talk to them again, but resisting the urge (much like an alcoholic who struggles with sobriety) can give you confidence that you can truly do better and live lighter without their presence. I don't think sending them a final message will be necessary; your silence should be loud and clear regarding your intentions.
