You can't afford to live near the beach.", "YTA.  He cant afford the apt you want on his salary alone, and you are unwilling to chip in and save less per month although he has been paying all the bills except electricity.  \n\nIt is wrong of you to expect your husband to sell his car to fund your dream apt when you are unwilling to contribute any $$ in order to get the apt & are also unwilling to compromise on the proximity to the beach \n\nYour husband is correct, you are being very unreasonable.   \n\nYour husband might be a candidate for sainthood for having the patience to live with someone so demanding and unwilling to compromise or contribute.\n\nIf you continue along the path of being obstinate, demanding, and unwilling to compromise, i foresee you looking at apts for single people in the near future.", "YTA for expecting your husband to pay the entire rent and the bills for YOUR dream apartment. the whole point of saving is so someday be able to move into the nicer home by the beach. get a place a few miles into town that\u2019s cheaper and continue saving your paychecks. you can still go see the beach and visit when ever you want.", "YTA.

Ridiculous, grow up, get a better job if you want this that bad.", "Very clearly YTA. You want to live someplace your partner can't afford to pay for, but you're unwilling to contribute.", "YTA, obviously... he said he can't afford it, and you're not willing to chip in... he'll be the one making all the sacrifice, while nothing changes for you...\n\nHow are you this clueless?", "YTA \n\nI'm from San Diego and the COL is crazy. Why would you want to waste all that money on an apartment??? Your entitlement is off the charts. It's women like you that make guys cautious about commitment and marriage.

Yeah, you're an asshole, lady.", "YTA. \nHe pays for everything and still you got annoyed because he can\u2019t afford YOUR dream beach house?

Spending 80% of his salary on an apartment is foolish.  You want the apartment,  step up and help out.", "Given the info, yes YTA if you insist on living somewhere you can't afford, and are unwilling to pay towards to get your dream. It sounds like you can't afford it right now without something giving out. Either cut into your savings to live your dream or give it up and move when you are in a better place salary-wise. Don't make your husband sell his dream car to fund your beach lifestyle", "YTA you're also unrealistic and entitled. San Diego is expensive. Rent somewhere close to the 56 and you can be at the beach in less than 20-30 minutes.", "YTA.\n\nWaterfront is expensive AF.

If he is paying for most of the bills and the rent, seems like he would know whether something was too expensive or not. You want him to sell his dream car so you can live a couple miles closer to the beach? You sound incredibly entitled. I feel so sad for your husband.", "YTA.  Most of us don't get what we want in life and you are lucky to have a roof over your head.  Nothing is stopping you from visiting the beach whenever you want.  Your husband is showing financial prudence, and you are not.  You should expect to contribute something to rent if you insist on living there.  But your husband is right - living near the beach won't matter much if something happens and you have hardly any savings.", "I would not be surprised if he ends up leaving you. He pays everything, you pay nothing but want to live somewhere expensive and he telling you he can\u2019t afford it. YTA. Help him out if you want to live the lavish life by the beach darling!", "YTA - and Im sorry for you husband marrying such an unreasonable person. You can\u2019t afford it, end of conversation.

YTA", "YTA you should have chosen a higher paying career if you want to live somewhere exorbitantly expensive. What is more important saving for a home or living paycheck to paycheck? Needs before wants. You have a car, drive to the beach.", "yta. You want to live somewhere you can't afford and don't care how it will affect your husband. Why should he have to sell his dream car just to satisfy your unrealistic desire? Marriage is about compromise. Save up now and in the future when you CAN afford it, then you can live by the beach.", "YTA - if you want something, you should work more or harder to get it and not expect your husband do make all the sacrifices.", "YTA. You want to live next to the beach, so you should sacrifice your savings to make that happen. If you don't want to sacrifice for something only you want, then let your husband pick an apartment that fits your budget.", "YTA how entitled are you? He pays for basically everything so you can save and because he feels an apartment that you dream of is too expensive you won't budge or help contribute?

If you can afford to live at the beach and pay for it yourself then go ahead but don\u2019t expect someone else to waste their money funding your immature dreams.

Listen to your husband.", "YTA", "YTA. You want the expensive place but don't want to limit the amount of savings you can put away each month. Well guess what? Math is math and if you can't afford it without limiting savings and you won't limit savings, you have no choice but to live biking distance to the beach and not walking distance.

You could have a cheaper car that is paid off already", "YTA. Asking your husband to live above your means is unreasonable.

San Diego housing and rental costs are sky high. It isn't unusual for people here to pay 50% of their income on these costs alone. You need to contribute more towards your shared living expenses and you need to be more flexible with where you are willing to live. I can get to the beach from my more central neighborhood within 10 minutes. It sounds as if your combined income will allow you to afford to live in some pretty great areas. For example, neighborhoods like Barrio Logan, Golden Hill, North Park, South Park, University Heights, and Normal Heights are all centrally located with easy access to various free ways and public transportation.

I have no idea how bad or good it is in Oceanside, Imperial Beach, or some of the less-prime-when-I-lived-there beach towns are, but anything from Carlsbad to Coronado is going to be out of the question.
