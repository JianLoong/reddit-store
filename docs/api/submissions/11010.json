You can't afford to live near the beach.", "YTA.  He cant afford the apt you want on his salary alone, and you are unwilling to chip in and save less per month although he has been paying all the bills except electricity.  \n\nIt is wrong of you to expect your husband to sell his car to fund your dream apt when you are unwilling to contribute any $$ in order to get the apt & are also unwilling to compromise on the proximity to the beach \n\nYour husband is correct, you are being very unreasonable.   \n\nYour husband might be a candidate for sainthood for having the patience to live with someone so demanding and unwilling to compromise or contribute.\n\nIf you continue along the path of being obstinate, demanding, and unwilling to compromise, i foresee you looking at apts for single people in the near future.", "YTA for expecting your husband to pay the entire rent and the bills for YOUR dream apartment. the whole point of saving is so someday be able to move into the nicer home by the beach. get a place a few miles into town that\u2019s cheaper and continue saving your paychecks. you can still go see the beach and visit when ever you want.", "YTA.

Why would you want to waste all that money on an apartment??? Your entitlement is off the charts. It's women like you that make guys cautious about commitment and marriage.

Yeah, you're an asshole, lady.", "YTA. \nHe pays for everything and still you got annoyed because he can\u2019t afford YOUR dream beach house?

Spending 80% of his salary on an apartment is foolish.  You want the apartment,  step up and help out.", "Given the info, yes YTA if you insist on living somewhere you can't afford, and are unwilling to pay towards to get your dream. It sounds like you can't afford it right now without something giving out. Either cut into your savings to live your dream or give it up and move when you are in a better place salary-wise. Don't make your husband sell his dream car to fund your beach lifestyle", "YTA you're also unrealistic and entitled. San Diego is expensive.

If he is paying for most of the bills and the rent, seems like he would know whether something was too expensive or not. You want him to sell his dream car so you can live a couple miles closer to the beach? You sound incredibly entitled. I feel so sad for your husband.", "YTA.  Most of us don't get what we want in life and you are lucky to have a roof over your head.  Nothing is stopping you from visiting the beach whenever you want.

YTA", "YTA you should have chosen a higher paying career if you want to live somewhere exorbitantly expensive. What is more important saving for a home or living paycheck to paycheck? Needs before wants. You have a car, drive to the beach.", "yta. You want to live somewhere you can't afford and don't care how it will affect your husband. Why should he have to sell his dream car just to satisfy your unrealistic desire? Marriage is about compromise.

You want to live next to the beach, so you should sacrifice your savings to make that happen. If you don't want to sacrifice for something only you want, then let your husband pick an apartment that fits your budget.", "YTA how entitled are you? He pays for basically everything so you can save and because he feels an apartment that you dream of is too expensive you won't budge or help contribute?

If you can afford to live at the beach and pay for it yourself then go ahead but don\u2019t expect someone else to waste their money funding your immature dreams.

Listen to your husband.", "YTA", "YTA. You want the expensive place but don't want to limit the amount of savings you can put away each month. Well guess what? Math is math and if you can't afford it without limiting savings and you won't limit savings, you have no choice but to live biking distance to the beach and not walking distance.

You could have a cheaper car that is paid off already", "YTA. Asking your husband to live above your means is unreasonable.

San Diego housing and rental costs are sky high. It isn't unusual for people here to pay 50% of their income on these costs alone. You need to contribute more towards your shared living expenses and you need to be more flexible with where you are willing to live. I can get to the beach from my more central neighborhood within 10 minutes. It sounds as if your combined income will allow you to afford to live in some pretty great areas. For example, neighborhoods like Barrio Logan, Golden Hill, North Park, South Park, University Heights, and Normal Heights are all centrally located with easy access to various free ways and public transportation.

I have no idea how bad or good it is in Oceanside, Imperial Beach, or some of the less-prime-when-I-lived-there beach towns are, but anything from Carlsbad to Coronado is going to be out of the question.

But in 15 minutes I can be at the beach near my home. When I am at the cabin, I am busy 70% of the day, in the winter it is dark before dinner, so I barely see the view 4 months of the year.\n\nYTA, you are unwilling to give up anything, you expect your husband to give up his dream car, just so you can smell salt in the air.", "YTA. This poor man is going to work to his death to satisfy your entitled AH.", "So you don't pay any of the bills and he might have to take on a 2nd job for your dream apartment?\n\nYTA how do you possibly think you're not?! I mean how did you write all that out", "The reason I am still a bit annoyed is because I know he can make way more than what he is currently making. He is actually very smart and talented but he refuses to switch to a higher paying job because he says he is still learning things in his job that will help him start his own independent consultancy. I don\u2019t doubt that at all because I know how smart he is but it\u2019s just that he is taking his time. He also puts some money on his life insurance every month so that if something happens to him, I and his parents will be financially secure( I am actually glad he does this tbh)", "This\n\nYou are an adult.

It\u2019s not just rent, unless they are coming from San Francisco, it\u2019s likely all of their expenses will be going up, not just rent.\n\nFor one, SDG&E has quite literally the highest electrical rates in all the US.

It\u2019s just that he thinks using more than 80% of his salary would be risky and he wants to keep a small percentage of his salary with him because his parents are poor and he helps them out financially once in a while. I just think he shouldn\u2019t be helping his parents financially and use that money in our lives.

You can't keep the same level of savings up if you're going to be by the beach - you have to pay the beach tax as it were.

I know this type", "YTA I live in a suburb in east county and the only reason my family can afford to live in a single family home is because our house was bought by my family pre 21st century. The tiniest shittiest apartment anywhere near the beach will cost an arm and a leg and it seems like your husband knows this very well. Also it\u2019s shitty of you to make him sacrifice his dream for yours when he pays all the bills.
