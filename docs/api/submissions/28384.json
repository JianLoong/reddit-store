Is this something he thinks you need to do or is it something you have voiced you wanted to do?\n\nMaybe I'm reading into that but if that is the only reason he got the dog then he's definitely an AH. Dogs need families to take care of them, not just to inspire exercise.\n\nI've just fostered a beautiful Belgian Malinois who had previously been adopted as an \"emotional support animal\" for a very nice but very messed up young man who couldn't meet any of her needs though she was meeting all of his. Poor thing was very neglected.\n\nIf your family cannot meet this dog's needs you should definitely consider rehoming to a family who is up to the task. Husky is a are very needy breed and will not do well being crated all the time because no one has time or energy to walk/play/love them.  No shame in rehoming either. \n\nI would have kept my foster but I knew we were not the right fit for her. She is very happy with her forever family.", "So\u2026Partner brought home a new dog without even discussing it with you and is mad at you for not wanting to walk it and care for it?

I'd want to have a mini meltdown and cry my eyes out. (And I am not the crying kind. \ud83d\ude02) Just no to a new baby, two older children *and* a dog bigger than the refrigerator at the same time. Frankly, I would pack my kids and go to a hotel for the weekend before I tried to negotiate a sentient being gift that I never asked for and don't want to be responsible for.\n\nKids love a dog they're scared of. So much fun. omg. I wish you could film all this and show the video to your husband because he seems to be the only one who can't see the problems this has created.\n\nNTA. And tell him you don't want this dog. A dog is as dependent as a newborn when it hasn't been trained and has no primary caregiver.", "Nta.  It sounds like the dog is too much for you to handle.  I'm a big proponent of not walking dogs that you can't control and I don't really see how a mom with 3 small kids to lug around can safely control and excited, poorly trained dog described as a horse.  Also, poor cat.  That's not a great lifestyle for it.  I think a serious discussion about keeping the dog needs to come up, because it doesn't sound like it was discussed before brining it in to the household and you both don't seem to be in agreement about caring for it.  Whats the childcare split between you?", "NTA and pets are always 2 yes/1 no situations, especially with a 6 month old and 2 other children in the house. What was he thinking??Rehome the dog or rehome the partner.", "NTA - a dog like that is a decision that everyone should have agreed on before it was brought home. With a six month old baby, this dog sounds like waaaayyy too much. I'd be telling my husband that he can keep me and the kids or he can keep the dog. Not both.", "NTA.\n\nWhy did your husband get this dog? He just brings this big untrained dog into a home with three kids, one being a baby? Did you guys discuss getting a dog at all or did he just bring it home one day? \n\nHe decided to get it, he can care for and train it. If not, then it needs to be rehomed. It\u2019s not fair to you and the kids, whom are scared of it. It\u2019s not fair to the baby. Hell, it\u2019s not fair to the dog.", "> is ostensibly here to get me out of the house more and running ten miles a day again. I am nursing and doing life on say 1500 calories per diem average.\n\nSounds like you're burying the lede here. Why are you eating so little? Why is there an expectation you're going to \"run ten miles a day again\"? Where is this coming from?", "NTA.   Your partner is the one of the worst kind of adopters this dog could encounter.  He made a unilateral decision to adopt a living, breathing creature and also that you would be the one to take care of it.  He's setting that poor pup up to fail and making sure it can't be adopted by owners who are more prepared to love and support it in the meantime.  \n\nAnd also, who the fuck brings home a surprise dog for their wife to take care of when she's already dealing with a newborn and two other children?!?  That dude is a total moron.", "YTA for being in 1500cal while nursing - how does you doctor feel about that? How do you even have any energy? Please, consult your doctor.", "NAH. The reason you have no energy is because you are trying to breastfeed on a low-callorie diet.  \n\n\n \"Breastfeeding mothers generally need more calories to meet their nutritional needs while breastfeeding. An additional 330 to 400 kilocalories (kcal) per day is recommended for well-nourished breastfeeding mothers, compared with the amount they were consuming before pregnancy (approximately 2,000 to 2,800 kcal per day for breastfeeding women verses 1,600 to 2,400 kcal per day for moderately active, non-pregnant women who are not breastfeeding).\"   \n[https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/diet-and-micronutrients/maternal-diet.html](https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/breastfeeding-special-circumstances/diet-and-micronutrients/maternal-diet.html) \n\nEat better.

You have a newborn, plus older kids, you have no time to train a dog. Doesn't sound like the partner is going to do it. Training is the answer.

And your kids don't either.\n\nThe cat was there first and his comfort should have been priority when getting a dog (one he gets along with or none if you can't find one).\n\nThe dog doesn't deserve to be \"crated at night scratching his face off\" and not getting the exercise it needs. This dog deserves better than what your husband is willing to offer him.\n\nAnd you shouldn't have to fullfill the dogs needs for exercise/ training if you didn't even say \"yes\" to it.\n\nAlso your kids are scared? Hell no... the dog needs a different home. For you, the cat, the kids and especially for the dog himself.

If that dog wasn't raised with cats from puppyhood to view cats as family, he's a huge risk. All it takes is one time of his hunting instinct kicking in for your cat to die - you gotta get them in separate homes as quickly as you can. This is not a safe situation for your cat.", "You are six months postpartum with three young children you are caring for and he chose to bring another \"child\" into the house via this poorly trained horse-dog. How is your oldest supposed to confidently control a 65-pound dog that is not trained? I am so confused why he thought this was a good idea and why he is putting more of a load on your shoulders. He wanted the dog. He can train it. He can walk it.", "Why does he get to comment on your activity level? How is that his business?", "I am not your employee. So fork off with that noise buddy.", "Can you leave dog to him and tell him you will take some other housechore or errand instead?", "He\u2019s being abusive if this is a ploy to get you back in shape.  What a jerk.", "Even if you're vegetarian, you should still be increasing your calorie count with other foods i think.  You might want to talk to your doctor about your diet.  Not meaning to be offensive, but is it good for you and the baby to be eating so little?  The baby's food is coming from you so if you're not eating enough nutrients, are they getting enough?  It sounds like your partner is trying to make you lose weight (food discussions, exercise), but drastically cutting calories maybe isn't the safest.  If you get lightheaded while carrying the baby he could get hurt. Sorry, hopefully that didn't come off offensive.", "But some meal replacement shakes and drink them when you\u2019re breastfeeding.

I could be wrong, but that is the feeling I'm getting...", "Yeah i mean if op agreed to keep the dog or wants to compromise?", "I just replied to a different comment of yours a second ago but this comment thread has sparked a question, so- \n\nYou mentioned you're only eating 1500 calories a day while also breastfeeding on top of being active with your other children and taking care of the house. How tall are you? How much do you weigh? Because breastfeeding alone takes up like 500 calories daily. That leaves less than 1000 calories for your body to function with each day. \n\nJust an example, usually women around 5'3 need 1500 calories to maintain a healthy weight while living a mostly sedentary lifestyle. For women who are more active, breastfeeding (both of which you are), or taller than this, 1500 a day doesn't cut it. \n\nI'm really worried about if your nutritional needs are being met. With him calling you lazy and trying to force you into jogging with this high energy dog, I'm also worried that you're eating such a low amount of calories to appease him.\n\nOh, btw, you are NOT lazy. You're an active mom who is breastfeeding and caring for a household of 6 (counting yourself). That's exhausting! You're doing a TON!", "I didn\u2019t think so. Sounds like ED to me. He suggested an egg and she responds about calories and how she doesn\u2019t want to cook lentils.", "I might have misinterpreted; I took her saying, \"... I tell him how many protein and calories are in an egg...\" as actually meaning how few calories an egg has - as if to say, \"What the heck is an egg gonna do for me and my hunger?\" Something like that - especially where comments were already made about him wanting her to get back into shape 6 months post-partum. You may be right, though. I think the only way we will find out is by asking OP directly.\n\nOP: Are you concerned that by eating more, you will be taking in  too many calories (you won't, by the way; as it's been stated, as a breastfeeding mother, you need more calories!!!!), or does *he* think you're eating too much and/or is trying to limit your intake?", "Lentils have less calories than eggs do."]}
