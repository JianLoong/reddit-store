He was later (more than 10 years) diagnosed with dementia.\n\nWhile I understand you wanted to have \"your day,\" I don't know that it would have hurt to let her hold the baby while you made tea before scooting her out the door again. Driving a half hour each way can be a bit harder for some older drivers.\n\nWhile you weren't necessarily an AH, you certainly weren't kind, compassionate, nor did you show grace. If I was your husband, I would be deeply offended on my family's behalf.", "NTA. The people responding to this are blowing my mind. Grandma is driving herself- she could have left at ANY time. She CHOSE to sit on the porch. She was intruding on OP\u2019s plans- it doesn\u2019t matter what those plans are- and blatantly ignoring the arrangements they\u2019d made. OP doesn\u2019t need to cater to manipulative relatives. She\u2019s allowed to have plans and set boundaries. Grandma may be a little older, but from what OP has told us she is not senile or dependent- she is a fully functioning adult who is using her age to manipulate the situation and be the victim. Expecting someone to accommodate you and drop everything they have planned is absolutely BS. What if OP hadn\u2019t been home? Or was on her way out? She is not obligated to cater to relatives who think her life doesn\u2019t matter and their wants are more important. Good grief, people. Grandma knew exactly what she was doing and intentionally manipulated the situation to appear the victim.", "Actually it IS her fault she got the days mixed up. But did she really? Or was this her crossing boundaries to get what she wanted?", "NTA.  You say she and others in your husband's family have a habit of showing up unannounced.  I don't care who they are, you don't show up unannounced at someone's house and go all \"shocked Pikachu\" that they don't let you in.   And if this isn't the first time it's not an \"oops\" it's not valuing or respecting your time.  The fact that your husband allows this kind of crap with his family means you have a husband problem.\n\nIf I was feeling generous and it was just her and just a rare event, I would give the benefit of the doubt, but the wording of your post says it's not rare, and it's not just her.  It sounds like your husband's family has a policy of \"what works for us and you'll take it & like it.\" You don't have to accept that, take it, or like it.", "Nta\n\n\nShe drives and works. Which means she keeps a schedule and understands dates. There is no mixing days up. \n\nYou have every right to deny someone access to your home and child. \n\nShe tried to do what she wanted. Wait for your hubby and snatched the baby from your that is NOT ok. I don't care who the hell it is. His family runs over the boundaries you set. Your hubby allows it \n\nAt this point you have a hubby problem.\n\nI would talk with him. Set boundaries with him on what you will allow with both sides of family. Then send a mass text to all family. \n\nSuch as no uninvited visits. Period. The door won't be answered and if it is you will be asked to leave. \n\nNo snatching baby from parents. To do so ends the visit immediately. \n\nIf people keep showing unannounced then they will be on time out from visits with baby for a month. A month added on for each infraction. \n\nTo those saying she is an AH for leaving her on the porch. She drives and has a job. Could she have gotten things mixed up sure. But she lives 30 mins away so the only reason to stay on the porch is what happened. Hubby comes home and she is poor me. My fault but since I am here. Not every person who is old has dementia. Not every older person who says I got dates mixed up is making a mistake. This is an ongoing issue and seems to be about boundaries being crossed. If she were younger everyone would be calling grandma an AH. Just because she is older ot does not give her a right to ignore boundaries and try and use her age to get what she wants", "NTA. She didn\u2019t get the days mixed up. She decided to just show up. Make everyone, including your husband, respect your boundaries.", "NTA.  \nWhile I don't have a kid, I set up strict rules with my family that unannounced visits that inconvenience me will be met with a door in the face. You are not wrong to 1. want bonding time with your baby 1on1, and 2. To ask people respect your time as an adult. Doubly so when  it seems to be a consistent issue within the family.", "As someone who gets overwhelmed by crazy in laws. NTA. I locked myself in the closet once because they showed up unannounced after they ruined our chance at buying a house. MIL went to the open house behind our backs and acted like she was the boss. Our realtor called to let us know. It sounds like your in laws don\u2019t respect boundaries so even though it seems crazy, they need to realize they\u2019re on another level", "> Husband is pretty annoyed with me bc it\u2019s \u201cnot her fault she got the date mixed up\u201d.\n\nActually its her fault.

Don't open the door. Let them knock. If it's disturbing the baby. Call the cops. They are not entitled to your time.or your child. They can wait until your husband is home to come over. When they do show up go and lock yourself and the baby in your room.", "YTA - she clearly wants to spend time with you and your family hence her commenting she wants to come visit. I get that she got the dates mixed up, and it\u2019s unfortunate that it didn\u2019t work with your schedule but you could\u2019ve easily invited her for a few minutes, set a boundary like \u201cI actually have an appointment in an hour but we can hang out with you until we have to leave\u201d.\n\nLeaving her outside your home like a stranger seems very weird especially since she travelled 30 mins to come see your baby. Also might want to check her since it\u2019s a sign of dementia which makes it worse", "Not gonna judge, because I think it depends at least a little on how your husband feels about his family visiting unannounced or on the wrong days. If he is okay with it and if it's normal in his family then you and he need to really communicate and figure out a way that both of your needs/wants are respected and valued. \n\nIt's weird to me that friends/family would need to \"book a date\" to visit and wouldn't be welcome otherwise. I may have to tell a visitor that they're welcome to visit but I have a thing scheduled at X time so won't be available then, and no one has ever taken issue with that. I could be driving through a city while working where my niece lives and pop on by - if she's home and available, great, and if not then a bit of disappointment but we all go on with our lives. Never in a million years would a family member tell me to kick rocks because I didn't schedule visiting in advance. \n\nI'm aware that not all families operate this way, and if I married someone who is like you then we'd have to come to some sort of compromise because it would bother me immensely to reject family visits. If it bothers my partner immensely to have unannounced visits, we'd have to find a solution so that each of use is sometimes bothered and other times accommodated.", "NTA - BUT you need to do some careful investigating - for example why did she get the days wrong.  You\u2019re not as familiar with her so you\u2019re likely to be the first to spot the signs of Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia - be very careful to rule other options out first.", "NTA- talk to your husband about your concerns because he might not see it (either through ignorance or because he is \u201cused to it\u201d).", "YTA.

This would be my gram when she started showing signs of dementia. Her calendar would be full of things, all written into the wrong dates. \n\nI get you wanted to be alone, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d turn my or my husband\u2019s gram away. \n\nMIL yes.", "Whatever your reasoning or whatever the situation, you don't let someone sit on the porch and deny him/her entry.", "You are definitely the asshole.

It costs nothing to be nice.", "NTA-continue to set your boundaries or people will pull you in all directions.", "If I were her husband I would have respected my wife and her boundaries. I wouldn\u2019t have looked at her and said what basically equated to a \u201cscrew you. My grandma is more important than your mental health. My grandma visiting our baby is more important than you.\u201d Because that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re saying.", "If there's concerns of dementia then they need to get her into a doctor ASAP, not worry about letting her see the baby. Early treatment if a life changer.  If she is diagnosed with dementia then OP's partner should know. Parents should also be aware if someone has dementia, as it's very dangerous to leave children in their care ( u/wrenatumn if this seems to be the case). \n\nNta. Help her talk to a doctor if she seems off, continue with the boundaries if she is mentally sound. If she refuses to check with a doctor then continue and visits with eyes on her and the baby at all times and take the baby away if she starts getting confused or upset. \n\nI grew up around dementia, it's unpredictable as you haven't a clue what they are thinking and they aren't in their right mind to give you any warning that they forgot. That's why we make sure that people with dementia have someone to check up on them until they need fulltime supervision (in the same house 24/7 as someone else), and then full 24/7 support (someone checking on them constantly and making sure that they don't wander off).", "Apparently people don't do politeness these days. Everything is about what *they* need, and putting yourself out for another must have gone out of fashion or something.", "And the baby snatching!!!  Like, who the F does she think she is,  taking a kid from its mother without asking?", "Since you're considering that for the future, consider sticking to your guns because making tea while someone with possible dementia is holding your baby isn't safe at all. Its okay to have anxiety and boundaries due to having anxiety. Don't let reddit strangers push you past boundaries you've already established to cope with your anxiety. There's a bunch of bad advice in this thread. Most everyone can benefit from therapy, but you don't need it because people coming over unannounced spikes ylur anxiety. That quite common, and it is her fault she got the days mixed up...", "You don't have to consider dementia, just have a basic level of courtesy and be able to realise that everything is not always about you.\n\nI also hate with a passion when people show up at my place unannounced, I need time to prepare for company, both mentally and generally I'd like to give my house a once-over as well. Nonetheless, if someone does show up, I show them a basic level of hospitality and at least invite them in, ask if they want a cup of tea, and say I don't have much time or whatever so they leave pretty quickly. This is just the most basic level of courtesy to a person that you know.\n\nThe fact that this was an older woman (your husband's grandma!) makes your behaviour even ruder. I'm finding it difficult to believe that there are actually people in the world that are as self-absorbed as you appear to be.", "Of course, you could just answer the door naked and say OOPS, didn't know you were coming.   And advise them they need to call in advance or face naked time again!", "This is really important context. She wanted to visit today so she did, regardless of what you wanted. Honestly I would\u2019ve packed up a baby bag and went to the door and \u201capologised\u201d that \u201cI\u2019m just on your way out for an appointment and can\u2019t be late\u201d, get in my car and bring baby to a cafe or a park.", "Grandma drove over there to visit so grandma could have driven home. Grandma took a bus, train or cab\u2026grandma could have taken that home. That\u2019s why this screams manipulation to me. If it is dementia something needs to be done.

They set a date and she came over on the wrong day completely unannounced. I don't care how old someone is, that's super rude. And how is she rude and self absorbed when a mother wants One on one time with her baby? Good grief.", "Totally disagree. Come when you\u2019re invited or when I have at least been given a heads up. I want my house to be at a certain standard of cleanliness, like not Amazon packages sitting in the doorway.

So I can see why OP felt the way she did especially since it keeps happening with her ILS.\n\nWe don't need therapy to get used to people being jerks. It's their issue to solve not ours.\n\nI mean just think about it. Someone wakes up one day and decides they will just show up at your house because THEY want to ,They decided it for themselves, it is what suits THEM and they completely disregard the fact that they didn't bother to include you in their plans that involve you being host . They don't care whether it suits you or whether you are busy. \n\nIt doesn't even cross their minds that you might not be up for visitors and expect to be treated with courtesy when they didn't bother do the same for you.\n\nA home isn't a 24/7 open bar .

Because of mess?", "But does that induce panic attacks? Because having a panic attack whenever someone comes to your house is not normal.", "This js the first time she\u2019s done this so the compassionate thing to do it chalk it up as a genuine mistake. You shouldn\u2019t let others actions and your own anxiety to be rude to someone (I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t be anxious, just don\u2019t leave an elderly person waiting outside)", "Why do you assume it's the first time?", "Hold up. She referred to them as \"anxiety attacks,\" not \"panic attacks.\" Anxiety attacks are a colloquialism, not a diagnosis. OP is simply stating that she had a burst of anxiety. YOU are making it into a diagnosis and overstating the case.\n\nOP did not use the term \"panic attack,\" which is diagnosable condition - YOU did. Educate yourself on this if you do not believe me. Having anxiety over people violating your boundaries IS VERY normal, and not at all pathological.\n\nAt any rate, I realize it was probably unintentional, but it is not fair to OP to distort her reality just to win an argument.", "Except you're wrong. It wasn't a 'genuine' mistake, its a repeated behaviour from the elderly women on OPs partners side. OPs boundary was reasonable.", "used the wrong word by using anxiety and panic interchangeably, but, I never made a diagnosis. Where I am anxiety attacks are not colloquialism. \n\nIf someone knocked on OP's door because they went to the wrong house, by OP's admission that would give her anxiety. \n\n>I just get anxiety attacks when people show up unannounced to my home \n\nGetting an anxiety attack because someone called to your house unexpectedly isn't normal. \n\nI completely get someone violating boundaries is different, but again, this is different", "In Ireland, anxiety attacks are also a colloquialism.\n\nThis is not different. You clearly do not understand how anxiety works, that there are triggers, and you are taking this ignorance out on OP.\n\nOP has clearly stated that the entire family are repeat offenders, and her husband tears down/stomps on her boundaries repeatedly himself. It is - if you don't know, try to imagine - anxiety-inducing to be told that your needs don't matter - by numerous people! Habitually. Hers is a very normal reaction to a repeat stressor.\n\nYour original comment was mean-spirited and you are doubling down for no reason.", "Anxiety is unpredictable\u2026 You do not get to determine what is acceptable for other people to have anxiety over\u2026 Can it seem small to you? Yes, Does that invalidate it for someone else? No", "Actually, unexpected social interactions is one of the biggest catalysts for anxiety.  It's very normal."]}
