Why would you leave the poor dear on the porch????", "My father never showed up at the right time or on the right day after my mother died. He was later (more than 10 years) diagnosed with dementia.\n\nWhile I understand you wanted to have \"your day,\" I don't know that it would have hurt to let her hold the baby while you made tea before scooting her out the door again. Driving a half hour each way can be a bit harder for some older drivers.\n\nWhile you weren't necessarily an AH, you certainly weren't kind, compassionate, nor did you show grace. If I was your husband, I would be deeply offended on my family's behalf.", "NTA. The people responding to this are blowing my mind. Grandma is driving herself- she could have left at ANY time. She CHOSE to sit on the porch. She was intruding on OP\u2019s plans- it doesn\u2019t matter what those plans are- and blatantly ignoring the arrangements they\u2019d made. OP doesn\u2019t need to cater to manipulative relatives. She\u2019s allowed to have plans and set boundaries. Grandma may be a little older, but from what OP has told us she is not senile or dependent- she is a fully functioning adult who is using her age to manipulate the situation and be the victim. Expecting someone to accommodate you and drop everything they have planned is absolutely BS. What if OP hadn\u2019t been home? Or was on her way out? She is not obligated to cater to relatives who think her life doesn\u2019t matter and their wants are more important. Good grief, people. Grandma knew exactly what she was doing and intentionally manipulated the situation to appear the victim.", "Actually it IS her fault she got the days mixed up. But did she really? Or was this her crossing boundaries to get what she wanted?", "NTA.  You say she and others in your husband's family have a habit of showing up unannounced.  I don't care who they are, you don't show up unannounced at someone's house and go all \"shocked Pikachu\" that they don't let you in.   And if this isn't the first time it's not an \"oops\" it's not valuing or respecting your time.  The fact that your husband allows this kind of crap with his family means you have a husband problem.\n\nIf I was feeling generous and it was just her and just a rare event, I would give the benefit of the doubt, but the wording of your post says it's not rare, and it's not just her.  It sounds like your husband's family has a policy of \"what works for us and you'll take it & like it.\" You don't have to accept that, take it, or like it.", "Nta\n\n\nShe drives and works. Which means she keeps a schedule and understands dates. There is no mixing days up. \n\nYou have every right to deny someone access to your home and child. \n\nShe tried to do what she wanted. Wait for your hubby and snatched the baby from your that is NOT ok. I don't care who the hell it is. His family runs over the boundaries you set. Your hubby allows it \n\nAt this point you have a hubby problem.\n\nI would talk with him. Set boundaries with him on what you will allow with both sides of family. Then send a mass text to all family. \n\nSuch as no uninvited visits. Period. The door won't be answered and if it is you will be asked to leave. \n\nNo snatching baby from parents. To do so ends the visit immediately. \n\nIf people keep showing unannounced then they will be on time out from visits with baby for a month. A month added on for each infraction. \n\nTo those saying she is an AH for leaving her on the porch. She drives and has a job. Could she have gotten things mixed up sure. But she lives 30 mins away so the only reason to stay on the porch is what happened. Hubby comes home and she is poor me. My fault but since I am here. Not every person who is old has dementia. Not every older person who says I got dates mixed up is making a mistake. This is an ongoing issue and seems to be about boundaries being crossed. If she were younger everyone would be calling grandma an AH. Just because she is older ot does not give her a right to ignore boundaries and try and use her age to get what she wants", "NTA. She didn\u2019t get the days mixed up. She decided to just show up. Make everyone, including your husband, respect your boundaries.", "NTA.  \nWhile I don't have a kid, I set up strict rules with my family that unannounced visits that inconvenience me will be met with a door in the face. You are not wrong to 1. want bonding time with your baby 1on1, and 2. To ask people respect your time as an adult. Doubly so when  it seems to be a consistent issue within the family.", "As someone who gets overwhelmed by crazy in laws. NTA. I locked myself in the closet once because they showed up unannounced after they ruined our chance at buying a house. MIL went to the open house behind our backs and acted like she was the boss. Our realtor called to let us know. It sounds like your in laws don\u2019t respect boundaries so even though it seems crazy, they need to realize they\u2019re on another level", "> Husband is pretty annoyed with me bc it\u2019s \u201cnot her fault she got the date mixed up\u201d.\n\nActually its her fault.

Speaking as a fellow introvert, I know you need your alone or alone-with-baby time to recharge. \n\nYou\u2019ve made it clear you don\u2019t like drop-by visits. Neither do I. I\u2019ve asked family members who have a tendency to drop by or get confused about dates to call or text before they leave their house. That gives me time to divert them, especially if we had a plan and today\u2019s not the plan.", "NTA\n\nYour problem is with your partner, though.

I get that she got the dates mixed up, and it\u2019s unfortunate that it didn\u2019t work with your schedule but you could\u2019ve easily invited her for a few minutes, set a boundary like \u201cI actually have an appointment in an hour but we can hang out with you until we have to leave\u201d.\n\nLeaving her outside your home like a stranger seems very weird especially since she travelled 30 mins to come see your baby. Also might want to check her since it\u2019s a sign of dementia which makes it worse", "Not gonna judge, because I think it depends at least a little on how your husband feels about his family visiting unannounced or on the wrong days. If he is okay with it and if it's normal in his family then you and he need to really communicate and figure out a way that both of your needs/wants are respected and valued. \n\nIt's weird to me that friends/family would need to \"book a date\" to visit and wouldn't be welcome otherwise. I may have to tell a visitor that they're welcome to visit but I have a thing scheduled at X time so won't be available then, and no one has ever taken issue with that. I could be driving through a city while working where my niece lives and pop on by - if she's home and available, great, and if not then a bit of disappointment but we all go on with our lives. Never in a million years would a family member tell me to kick rocks because I didn't schedule visiting in advance. \n\nI'm aware that not all families operate this way, and if I married someone who is like you then we'd have to come to some sort of compromise because it would bother me immensely to reject family visits. If it bothers my partner immensely to have unannounced visits, we'd have to find a solution so that each of use is sometimes bothered and other times accommodated.", "NTA - BUT you need to do some careful investigating - for example why did she get the days wrong.  You\u2019re not as familiar with her so you\u2019re likely to be the first to spot the signs of Alzheimer\u2019s or dementia - be very careful to rule other options out first.", "NTA- talk to your husband about your concerns because he might not see it (either through ignorance or because he is \u201cused to it\u201d).", "YTA.
