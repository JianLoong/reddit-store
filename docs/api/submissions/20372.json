All day long he has continued to chastise me, calling me an \u201cidiot\u201d, \u201cfinancially irresponsible\u201d, and having \u201cno common sense\u201d because I should have somehow known that he wanted to use his credit card for the points. \n\nI believe that if he wanted to use his credit card, he should have communicated to that to me - he scheduled the drop off himself and told me they would be coming within a certain time window days in advance, so he had plenty of time to let me know his preference. \n\nHe believes that the onus is on me, and I should have either A: anticipated that he would want the points and refuse the options the rug guy presented in order to coordinate a way to pay by credit card or B: made the guy wait while I call him and ask him how he wants me to pay.\n\nI\u2019ve said repeatedly that I believe I deserve an apology, and that he can\u2019t be this awful to me (calling me names, continuing all day to reprimand me for not doing what he thought I should do) when he could have simply let me know in advance that he hadn\u2019t paid yet and would want to pay by card, but he refuses to apologize, feels completely justified, and remains so furious at me that he\u2019s sleeping in another room.

How are they going to say you're financially irresponsible when they're having a meltdown over missing some credit card points? You deserve more than an apology. Calling you an idiot is fucked up. Leave the asshole before it's too late. They seem abusive and the fact he feels justified makes it seem like it will only get worse. Also the whole thing is his fault. He's schedule irresponsible and can't even own up to it", "NTa. Does your fiance become verbally abusive a lot? That is what you described. He chose to berate you for paying for an unexpected thing when he should have prepared you for the delivery and asked if you were available vs assuming (also a red flag). I ask this because reading this you're asking if you are the asshole and detail this in a casual way.\n\nThis is not normal or healthy behavior and you really need to consider if this is the future you want. Do you want kids? He will do this in front of and to them.\n\nFor added clarity the cycle of abuse begins really small. This is early abuse. It's always stuff you can justify. The increments of worsening happen slowly so that the slightly worse thing? Also justified because it's not that much worse. It's never really fast. It's also not always conscious but can be. \n\nThe cycle:\n\nThe incident. Always your fault according to the abuser. Always. You made them do it because you didn't do the invisible tapdance of perfection. \n\nThe apology. This can come with love bombing as gifts or excessive attention. It is surprisingly effective because the interruption of thinking about their behavior paired with promises it will never happen again and proof via that wonderful time is amazing. The gifts will later be weaponized by most abusers as is the attention. (I did x so you owe me)\n\nThe next step is the honeymoon period. Combined with the apology it feels like change. It's great now. They're trying, everything is perfect. \n\nNow comes the building tension. The abuser is looking for their abuser excuse. Some refer to this as walking on eggshells. I refer to it as the pressure cooker. You know you will fuck it up somehow. \n\nThen we cycle back to the incident. \n\nYou cannot fix them, change them, nor can you actually out maneuver them by being the perfect wife. A lot of abuser excuses are manufactured. I don't know of any that my ex-husband didn't have to create.  The dumbest one? My wanting to be to work on time was selfish of me. I should have been late because he didn't want me to go. When I was late to work for him? I was then risking my job and he couldn't work right now because his boss was persecuting him.  I was raised in abuse so I didn't see many red flags then. \n\nThere's a Bojack Horseman line that is shockingly pertinent to abuse. When you love someone and are wearing rose colored glasses lasses all the red flags look like flags. Please look at how he treats you and how it's changed as objectively as you can because you deserve to have a safe and healthy relationship not this.", "NTA\n\nMissing out on a few points is hardly going to break the bank.

The merchant proceeded to send the money back to the wrong person - he\u2019s a small business, an older guy and an immigrant, English is not his first language and he\u2019s clearly not tech savvy. This morning he called and got ugly with the rug guy and the rug guy sent me the funds, to my correct account. So now, since he initially sent the money back to some rando by mistake, the merchant did close to $800 in work for free.", "NTA Agreed! This isn\u2019t about CC points.

Come to think of it, at this point in the relationship (living together, etc.) I don\u2019t think a single day goes by without him criticizing and critiquing me for *something*.", "That's probably more than the number of points he's scored.", "My thoughts exactly. He doesn\u2019t have the cash.", "He's definitely not rich if credit card points sends him into a tail spin... He's probably bringing a lot of credit card debt into the relationship.", "Do you want to be with someone who treats other people that way?", "So he's abusive to other people as well? Seriously get out of this relationship. Do you want to be treated like this forever?", "Dude. You don't deserve to be treated this way. Is this someone you want to spend the rest of your life with?", "I do love me a simple math problem to solve a complex emotional problem.", "That anger is a distraction technique from what is really going on.

He messed up and is putting it on you and abusing you.", "You're in for a lifetime of that if you marry. \n\nDo any of this sound familiar? \"Any normal person would have known that _________.\" \"You should have known that ________.\" \"Well obviously the thing to do would have been to _________.\" \n\nAll of this implies 1) you aren't normal 2) you know nothing 3) you're incapable of making common sense decisions 4) you're incompetent.\n\nThis is his opinion of you.\n\nTrust me I know. I married a guy who did the same. Every day walking on eggshells. The feeling of dread when he walks in the door, wondering what's going to set him off. Never feeling like you can ever 100% relax around him. Waiting for the moment he goes off. Being made to feel like a stupid child.\n\nYou are a grown ass adult. Your decisions and opinions and the way you handle things are all perfectly valid. He's making you question your ability to handle life.", "NTA - but he is abusive and would think again if you really want to marry someone like him. There were many ways of handling this situation that did not require verbally abusing you. He could have simply said \"oh I wanted to pay with credit card for the points, I'll call them later and see if they could do that instead.\" Which the poor merchant did do it seems in your other comment but your fiance seemed to also have yelled at him too. Your fiance is having a meltdown over something so insignificant, it's not like it is the end of the world or that he needs the points to live.

Surely, you must think you deserve better than to constantly be insulted and put down over nothing.", "Run now.  This is not okay.", "Better to be alone than to be married to a guy like this. Do you really want him screaming and yelling at your small children? Children who learn by making mistakes and pushing boundaries? Calling them idiots and stupid for trying to learn how to do simple things.", "I'm guessing you know what I quoted?", "NTA\n\ni don't know what s wrong with him. but it is not just a question of rug.\n\nyour are telepath. if he doesn't communicate and doesn't manage his payment himself he is plain wrong.\n\ni suggest you refuse to pay anything for him from now.\n\nand i am petty enough to ditch that damned rug.

You are not a mind reader.", "NTA\n\n> financially irresponsible\n\nSays the guy who offloaded his financial responsibility in the first place\n\nI totally understand wanting to use a credit card to build credit and get points, I do the same thing, but I can\u2019t fathom being actively upset about missing an opportunity. I mean idk how expensive this rug cleaning was, but even if it was egregious we\u2019re still talking like 1% that he would\u2019ve gotten back by using a card. It\u2019s an insane hill to die this violently on, I can\u2019t wrap my head around it unless he\u2019s incredibly strapped for cash, in which case why would he be spending this much on a rug cleaning? The whole scenario is perplexing to me", "NTA - is this the first time he's been verbally abusive to you?  Has he previously told you that CC points were so valuable to him and more valuable than you?", "It's not about the points. Zelle and venmo are both cash transactions. He doesn't have the cash or it's going to put him in a tight spot. No idea why he thinks berating his partner is better than just communicating that though", "No, he did not leave his credit card. He only told me they would be dropping the rugs off, I assumed he had digitally paid since he said nothing about payment.", "CC isn't even relevant.  He could have said \"Next time, please call me because I want to get the points for my credit card.\" He went with \"you're an idiot.\" Rug cleaning is the least of her problems.", "Maybe but I think it\u2019s more of a control thing.  Admitting that he didn\u2019t communicate and turning it on her is about needing to be in control.  If this is regular then it could be narcissistic behavior.", "May I ask why is this behavior acceptable to you?  You're sticking around for it so yeah, its acceptable to you.\n\nStop letting people treat you with disrespect just because you're a couple.  A loving partner will treat you better.  Its YOU that has to believe you deserve that and then act accordingly.\n\nRaise. your. standards, love.", "Thank you, based on all these responses I\u2019m about 99% sure I\u2019m going to leave him.", "I\u2019ve actually expressed this concern to him before, and he justifies and defends being hard on children in order to make them successful adults. He\u2019s literally argued with me about how spanking/hitting is okay and necessary. Now that I\u2019m actually saying it to someone, idk what the fuck I\u2019m doing considering bringing people into the world for him to abuse and destroy them.", "Please do not give him another chance. There is no chance in hell or heaven or on earth that he will change.  Make it a 100%, and find someone who really love you.", "He's wrong. As one of those kids who got beat up and belittled, instead of taught, it broke me. All the beatings only taught me that I'm unlovable and only deserve bad things in life. It's been really hard to remake myself. I don't talk to either of my parents anymore, even though only my dad beat me up, my mom stood by the side, doing nothing.\n\nThank you for thinking about your future children. Thank you for thinking about your future you. I'm sure that 60 year old you will thank you for thinking about her.", "No it's not."]}
