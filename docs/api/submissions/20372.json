All day long he has continued to chastise me, calling me an \u201cidiot\u201d, \u201cfinancially irresponsible\u201d, and having \u201cno common sense\u201d because I should have somehow known that he wanted to use his credit card for the points. \n\nI believe that if he wanted to use his credit card, he should have communicated to that to me - he scheduled the drop off himself and told me they would be coming within a certain time window days in advance, so he had plenty of time to let me know his preference. \n\nHe believes that the onus is on me, and I should have either A: anticipated that he would want the points and refuse the options the rug guy presented in order to coordinate a way to pay by credit card or B: made the guy wait while I call him and ask him how he wants me to pay.\n\nI\u2019ve said repeatedly that I believe I deserve an apology, and that he can\u2019t be this awful to me (calling me names, continuing all day to reprimand me for not doing what he thought I should do) when he could have simply let me know in advance that he hadn\u2019t paid yet and would want to pay by card, but he refuses to apologize, feels completely justified, and remains so furious at me that he\u2019s sleeping in another room.

How are they going to say you're financially irresponsible when they're having a meltdown over missing some credit card points? You deserve more than an apology. Calling you an idiot is fucked up. Leave the asshole before it's too late. They seem abusive and the fact he feels justified makes it seem like it will only get worse. Also the whole thing is his fault. He's schedule irresponsible and can't even own up to it", "NTa. Does your fiance become verbally abusive a lot? That is what you described. He chose to berate you for paying for an unexpected thing when he should have prepared you for the delivery and asked if you were available vs assuming (also a red flag). I ask this because reading this you're asking if you are the asshole and detail this in a casual way.\n\nThis is not normal or healthy behavior and you really need to consider if this is the future you want. Do you want kids? He will do this in front of and to them.\n\nFor added clarity the cycle of abuse begins really small. This is early abuse. It's always stuff you can justify. The increments of worsening happen slowly so that the slightly worse thing? Also justified because it's not that much worse. It's never really fast. It's also not always conscious but can be. \n\nThe cycle:\n\nThe incident. Always your fault according to the abuser. Always. You made them do it because you didn't do the invisible tapdance of perfection. \n\nThe apology. This can come with love bombing as gifts or excessive attention. It is surprisingly effective because the interruption of thinking about their behavior paired with promises it will never happen again and proof via that wonderful time is amazing. The gifts will later be weaponized by most abusers as is the attention. (I did x so you owe me)\n\nThe next step is the honeymoon period. Combined with the apology it feels like change. It's great now. They're trying, everything is perfect. \n\nNow comes the building tension. The abuser is looking for their abuser excuse. Some refer to this as walking on eggshells. I refer to it as the pressure cooker. You know you will fuck it up somehow. \n\nThen we cycle back to the incident. \n\nYou cannot fix them, change them, nor can you actually out maneuver them by being the perfect wife. A lot of abuser excuses are manufactured. I don't know of any that my ex-husband didn't have to create.  The dumbest one? My wanting to be to work on time was selfish of me. I should have been late because he didn't want me to go. When I was late to work for him? I was then risking my job and he couldn't work right now because his boss was persecuting him.  I was raised in abuse so I didn't see many red flags then. \n\nThere's a Bojack Horseman line that is shockingly pertinent to abuse. When you love someone and are wearing rose colored glasses lasses all the red flags look like flags. Please look at how he treats you and how it's changed as objectively as you can because you deserve to have a safe and healthy relationship not this.", "NTA\n\nMissing out on a few points is hardly going to break the bank. If it mattered that much he should have sorted it out himself.\n\nHow much are points worth anyway? Isn't it something like 1% of the transaction? Losing 1% is not exactly disastrous.", "NTA.\n\nIf he wanted to use his credit card, he should have communicated that to you AND sorted it out with the vendor himself.\n\nAdditionally, it is a MASSIVE red flag that he is calling you names and giving you the cold shoulder for a relatively minor issue (that is down to his own miscommunication).", "NTA- omg, this guy really does not like you. This is how you treat people you hate, not someone you are supposed to marry. Girl, run away from this dick pronto, because if this is how he is treating you pre-marriage, I can just imagine the bullshit he has in store for after the wedding...", "Of course, NTA. Please don't buy into his narrative. He's demanding, controlling, manipulative, and says you're an \"idiot\"? Why would you subject yourself to his behavior? Why do you want to be in relationship with someone who treats you this way?", "You\u2018re NTA. You bf is, though. Next time this idiot should schedule his shit when he\u2018s around to take care of it himself. What an AH.", "NTA If he\u2019s furious at that\u2026he shouldn\u2019t be sleeping in another room\u2026he should be sleeping in another house. Don\u2019t accept this behaviour from your partner \u2026you are better than that, kick him to the kerb", "NTA. You may want to consider what it means that your fianc\u00e9 thinks a few credit card points are more important than treating you with respect.", "Never pay with Venmo unless it's family. CC comes with protection if there was a issue with the services.", "Info: did he pay you back?", "Don't marry this guy. He sounds terrible. Nta", "Absolutely second this opinion. Leave this financial smartass with his credit card points.", "The card wasn't even a payment option anyway. This dude sucks.", "He can sleep in another room for the rest of his miserable controlling unreasonable life"]}
