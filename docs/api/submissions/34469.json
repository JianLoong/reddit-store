She was way out of line, and should be apologizing to you and your sister with a good reason why she acted that way. Just back off and see what happens. If she never calls back, you are better off.", "NTA, your girlfriend was clearly out of line, asking her to leave was the appropriate reaction.", "NTA", "I would say NTA. I like that you protect your sister. what she said was not that bad but if she cursed her out too.. That's not okay. You should break up or just say that it wasn't nice of her.", "NTA.  Your girlfriend was way out of line.  I don't think you have anything to apologize for.", "You're kind of TA but also not TA in this situation.  I think you could have handled it better with our gf (maybe a convo instead of abruptly making her leave) but she also should in no way be disrespecting your sisters privacy or being rude to her for no reason at all!!  Your gf is more of TA then you in this situation.  I would suggest waiting until she reaches out and then take the convo from there, boundaries are extremely important in a healthy relationship.  If she doesn't reach out cut your losses tbh", "NTA\n\nYour reaction was appropriate given the offense. She owes you and your sister an apology. If you don't get one, she's not girlfriend material.", "NTA Your girlfriend was out of line. It's not her home. When you are a guest in someone else's home, you don't behave like you own the place and barge into someone's room and start rooting round their closet.", "NTA and If my brothers gf did that to me I wouldn\u2019t have been so nice. But luckily I will never have that problem because my brother doesn\u2019t date weirdos with no boundaries. Great catch you got there. Your sister deserves an apology", "ESH. Could you have handled this better? Yes, yes you could. But life is not a movie script where everything happens flawlessly and on cue. A conversation should have happened while you were waiting with your GF for her ride.\n\nAs far as your GF, she is 100% the AH here. A closed door, to most people, is a universal sign that the occupant does not want to be disturbed and that a knock is required. Moreso in your case, as that is a family rule. Your GF barged in and proceeded to root through your shared closet. When your sister called her out on it, she cursed her and was rude in return.\n\nYour GF owes both you and your sister an apology for not only breaking your house rules, but for her boorish behavior as well. You might want to think long and hard about this relationship; you may be dodging a bullet here.", "NTA. Your girlfriend was out of line. She owes your sister an apology.\n\nHaving a conversation with your girlfriend before making her leave would have been ideal, but I appreciate that you were taken by surprise and had a knee-jerk reaction. Besides, I\u2019m sure your girlfriend is old enough to know that it\u2019s incredibly rude to barge into someone else\u2019s room, to mistreat her boyfriend\u2019s sister, and to disrespect someone else\u2019s home.", "Why exactly are you apologising?\n\nYour GF barges into your sister's room and instead of apologising, doubles down and curses?\n\nOf course you're going to defend your sister.\n\nLeave her to stew. I'd love to think the reason she's gone quiet is because she's ashamed of herself, but somehow, I doubt it.\n\nNTA", "Right?! Im struggling to figure out where the overreaction is? U cursed at my sister - u gotta go simple as that. AFTER barging in and not respectfully asking?!?! Yea u gotta go.\n\nNo one is about to come into my home and disrespect my family. Simple as that. \n\nCould he have made her apologize? Sure - doesnt make his reaction overt.  Doesnt mean the sister would have accepted or wanted her to stay.", "Agreed! Sounds like OP might be dodging a bullet with this one. That is not a normal attitude to have in someone else's house.", "NTA.  Ex gf.", "NTA. \n\nBut I'm really interested in the dynamics of this home. You're not allowed to keep the door closed (unless studying or changing) but your girlfriend is allowed to sleep over? Fascinating.", "There is just... so much to unpack here.\n\nYour parents decided it'd be a good idea to have you and your sister share a closet? You aren't allowed to close your bedroom doors, but you can have boyfriend/girlfriend sleepovers???\n\nBizarre.", "NTA - I mean, not mentioning anything at the moment kind of sucks. Did she not ask why you were making her leave? But it wasn\u2019t an AH move to make her leave.", "NTA, she disrespected your sister, your home and you. I'm thinking this almost sounds like some kind of viral test. Like, she read or heard somewhere \"do this and see who your boyfriend values more, bonus points if he also ends up apologizing to you\".", "Your GF was exceptionally rude.\n\nNTA Good for you.", "NTA, I think you reacted very well. You don't owe her an apology but she owes one to you and your sister.", "NTA- but what\u2019s with the not being allowed to close your doors???", "Am i the only one who thinks the gf is somehow jealous of the sister or nah? NTA btw. The gf is coocoo.", "Completely unrelated...but is it normal for parents to allow their childrens bf/gf to sleep over?", "You're only TA for apologizing and being the first to reach out to her. What she did was rude and out of line, she has some sort of weird hostility towards your sister, it seems. NTA", "You are not allowed to close your door?", "NTA. As long as you didn't manhandle her on the way out, there's nothing wrong with the way you acted. I think you feel bad because you know this is the end of the relationship--and that's probably a good thing. It's your family house, she was a guest, she has no right to push her way into your sister's room, definitely no right to curse at her, and no right to go through your stuff either. This shows that she thinks she has the right to take anything she wants of yours, that what's yours is hers. You're only dating, she is very wrong. Find yourself a new girl.", "NTA. Your gf just gave you a glimpse of her real self.  She showed you who she really is. Believe her.  You're young, but life is short. Don't waste any more time on this person.", "NTA. Leave her IMO. Sadly, she is not a keeper.", "NTA don\u2019t apologize that was the perfect way to end the beginning of a toxic relationship", "Never apologize for other people's rude actions, especially ones committed in your home.

Glad you stuck up for your sister. Dump the GF.", "NTA - that was in no way an overreaction. Don\u2019t invite her back into your life.", "NTA but your girlfriend's manners are atrocious.  You don't give your ages but it does seem odd that you are old enough to date but aren't allowed to close your bedroom door except in specific circumstances.  Is that some cultural thing in your country?", "NTA don\u2019t apologize or it\u2019ll be worse next time", "NTA you dodged a bullet.", "NTA - Stop apologizing and stop calling. Your (hopefully EX)GF had no right to barge into someone's room and start rifling through their stuff. She did not have permission and was completely rude.\n\nNo, until she apologizes to you and your sister, she can keep her silence and learn some damn manners. Pretend she doesn't exist. Then when she pops her head up pretending everyone else is at fault, tell her she apologizes to you both and never acts like that again, or things are over.", "NTA she needs to know boundaries . And though yall share a closet . If your sister is in there with the door closed , she should know to knock before entering what if she was naked ?", "NTA. Your girlfriend is rude. You knocked on a closed door. She barged in. She cursed at the occupant for speaking up. Sister and you were in your own home, Girlfriend was visiting yet acted like she owned the place. Drop her and find another girlfriend. Pick one with some manners this time. It will simplify your relationships with just about the entire world.", "Nah your girlfriend is rude for that.

Your gf was incredibly rude and disrespectful, and you did the right thing in standing by your sister.", "INFO: did you talk it out at all or just throw her out? You say your girlfriend is usually gentle and this was unexpected behavior so did you ask her what was up,  was something else bothering her?", "Lots off people ( men and women ) will act  certain way to get others interested in them . You  THOUGHT  she was gentle --what else were you wrong about ?", "NTA I think you have every right to be angry at your gf for not being respectful of your family's rules. It can mean that she thinks that you will defend her regardless and can disrespect the rules.

What happened is a huge red flag and you should treat it as such. NTA", "NTA. I applaud you for your actions! In that moment, you chose to kick out the person who invaded your sister's privacy and was nasty to her.

Good riddance. \nDo not apologise.", "NTA. You obviously have standards. Your exGF didn't understand basic manners. Good luck with your next relationship.", "NTA. She got comfortable enough to show you her true colours. Not only it\u2019s not her house, but it wasn\u2019t even your space. What was she even doing going to your sister\u2019s room? Did she think you needed an escort to get a hoodie?!\n\nGood job on taking out the trash", "Ok OP, maybe u need to hear this.

Get a girlfriend who treats everyone better.", "You are not asshole but your (i hope now ex) girl friend is. I hate people with such disrespect.", "NTA. Why are you scrambling after her trying to apologize? You did nothing wrong. She needs to apologize to your sister, and if she has no interest in doing that, as well as no interest in even discussing it with you, you'd be better off moving on from this relationship.", "NTA, if she can\u2019t respect your sister\u2019s privacy, she most likely won\u2019t respect yours. If she shows any more signs of this kind of selfishness, dump her.", "NTA, your girlfriend is the a******. She is acting like that and hiding her true personality dump her immediately and move on. There are literally millions of fish in the sea, just because your school's amount of females are limited does not mean you'll be alone for the rest of your life. It's those moments where your girlfriend will act like that that show to show you her true colors. Dump this girl you will want somebody who will treat your family and more than likely you better. If she acts gentle that is indeed a Act, people in another person's house does not act like that in your sister's room.", "Don\u2019t apologise dude, you did the right thing, stand by it.

She\u2019s not returning the interest of being in contact. She knows how to reach you. She needs to apologize to your sister if anything. \n\nBut for now, I\u2019d consider her your Ex.", "NTA.

You were 100% NOT over reacting! She intruded on your sisters private space, was extremely entitled and rude to your sister in her PRIVATE space and acted just completely inappropriately!!\n\nYour response was absolutely spot on and you have nothing to apologize for! \n\nHad you not reacted like that, your poor sister would be wondering if this was going to be reaccuring. If she not had to lock her door and wonder, if she's changing, have maybe alone time (we all do!), or anything that would DEFINITELY need a knock...if someone is going to just barge in.\n\nThat's a terrible feeling that you can't even be in your bedroom, doing whatever you damn well please, wondering if someone is just going to come barging in...

I say she showed her true colors at that moment and you should open your eyes. You did not overreact she is a major AH, ditch her.", "NTA", "Sounds like a very poorly executed power move. Your gf made the mistake of assuming her position as your gf entitled her some deference and thought she could throw her weight around. Good for you for showing her the reality of the situation. You have nothing to apologise for. Make her absence from your life permanent. NTA", "NTA \n\nYou didn't overreact. You acted in a respectable mature manner. For real, good job. \n\nEverything your girlfriend did was super rude. Barging in. Rude comment to your sister. It doesn't matter if she's normally gentle. If this is how she normally acts when she isn't gentle or gets mildly called out for bad behavior, then no amount of gentleness excuses it. She can be gentle, but if she gets mad, then she still needs to treat others with respect at the same time. Anger & proper behavior don't exclude each other. You can be angry, get your point across, & act respectable at the same time.", "HAHAHHAHAHAHAHA...no.

Hopefully it doesn\u2019t take your relationship downhill, maybe your girlfriend was having a bad day. That happens sometimes people are mad and say and do things that they know are wrong, but because they are mad they double down and continue anyways. I\u2019d talk with your girlfriend about if she had something going on, but don\u2019t go chasing after her. If she isn\u2019t responding after you (justifiably) sent her home for being disrespectful then she\u2019s likely embarrassed by her actions. That or she\u2019s mad at you for sending her home, and if she can\u2019t understand why you did then that is her problem. I\u2019d just avoid talking for the rest of the night and get ahold of her tomorrow. Unless she calls you then it\u2019s up to you if you want to answer or not. But you shouldn\u2019t be the one chasing after her and apologizing because you did nothing wrong. If you guys do end up discussing what happened don\u2019t apologize either.

He didn\u2019t need to call her out, like what kind of person wouldn\u2019t realize they were in the wrong? Not anyone worth continuing a relationship with tbh. \n\nIf she immediately apologized she would have stood maybe a chance? But not anymore imo", "Ya true, was just responding to the comment about the door thing. I think it\u2019s weird to have the rule that they\u2019re open all the time unless changing or studying, but if I were a parent I\u2019d make them stay open if the bf/gf came over, and also no sleepovers", "I thought that was weird, old enough to have a girl over but mom does his laundry?", "He also says that she\u2019s usually really gentle, first time he\u2019s heard her curse.\n\nIt just seems weird to have your GF do a 180\u00b0 out of nowhere.", "Yeah tbh it makes OP an unreliable narrator to me that they just breezed over \"we're not allowed to have doors closed\".", "Maybe gentle with him but if she can\u2019t act right to his family that\u2019s a huge red flag. I couldn\u2019t imagine dating someone who was rude to my family and just so openly cursed and talked to them like that", "Oh yeah. Not saying talking to her would have been reason enough I stay in the relationship.\n\nThere\u2019s also no mention of ages or how long they\u2019ve been dating, whether this is first time she\u2019s been around his family, etc.", "She did act like a brat. However, that didn\u2019t give him the right to lay hands on her. Again, communication is the key. If OP had simply communicated with his girlfriend, I feel like things would\u2019ve ended up very differently. It isn\u2019t like a parent leading a kid away from a playground because this isn\u2019t a parent-child relationship, it\u2019s an (adult-adult) relationship. In your example, treating your significant other like a child won\u2019t help anything. Adults in a relationship should have equal footing and mutual respect. Even something like forcing her out physically is not healthy, in my opinion. \n\nAlso want to mention that I\u2019m not defending her, she does owe them an apology. A massive one at that. However, he does too for laying his hands on her. He doesn\u2019t need to apologize for anything else. I agree with you that I, too, would be embarrassed if I was her and acted up like her. \n\nDon\u2019t understand why I\u2019m being downvoted for saying this. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Idk I just don\u2019t really consider this as laying his hands on her. He grabbed her hand and had her exit his house. He didn\u2019t pick her up and throw her out. He didn\u2019t push her. From what I\u2019m reading it seemed like he remained pretty calm, angry, but calm. She also could have used her words and apologized right then. She just sat there and left. So idk. I think it\u2019s a little dramatic to say he got physical with her."]}
