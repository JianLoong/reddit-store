Is she weirdly jealous of your sister trying to claim her territory or something by being rude to her? I think you acted exactly the right way, until texting her to apologize. Leave her at the curb where you left her, she is garbage. \n\nI would dare any gf of my brothers to try and talk to me or treat me that way. The outstanding nerve of her", "NTA. GF should apologize for barging in. That\u2019s very odd.\n\nMaybe you overreacted a little, but I honestly would have asked her to leave, too. \n\nGood for you for sticking up for your sister. Says a lot of good about your character.", "NTA.  Your GF was out of line and totally disrespectful to your sister on several levels.  You were 100% right in escorting her out.  If this means the end of the relationship, which I assume you are now fearing, then so be it.  A girl like this will only get worse, not better, as time goes on.  She has shown you who she really is, and you need to take heed of that.  You have good values; find a girl who also shares your good values.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She was way out of line, and should be apologizing to you and your sister with a good reason why she acted that way. Just back off and see what happens. If she never calls back, you are better off.", "NTA, your girlfriend was clearly out of line, asking her to leave was the appropriate reaction.", "NTA", "I would say NTA. I like that you protect your sister. what she said was not that bad but if she cursed her out too.. That's not okay. You should break up or just say that it wasn't nice of her.", "NTA.  Your girlfriend was way out of line.  I don't think you have anything to apologize for.", "You're kind of TA but also not TA in this situation.  I think you could have handled it better with our gf (maybe a convo instead of abruptly making her leave) but she also should in no way be disrespecting your sisters privacy or being rude to her for no reason at all!!  Your gf is more of TA then you in this situation.  I would suggest waiting until she reaches out and then take the convo from there, boundaries are extremely important in a healthy relationship.  If she doesn't reach out cut your losses tbh", "NTA\n\nYour reaction was appropriate given the offense. She owes you and your sister an apology. If you don't get one, she's not girlfriend material.", "NTA Your girlfriend was out of line. It's not her home. When you are a guest in someone else's home, you don't behave like you own the place and barge into someone's room and start rooting round their closet.", "NTA and If my brothers gf did that to me I wouldn\u2019t have been so nice. But luckily I will never have that problem because my brother doesn\u2019t date weirdos with no boundaries. Great catch you got there. Your sister deserves an apology", "ESH. Could you have handled this better? Yes, yes you could. But life is not a movie script where everything happens flawlessly and on cue. A conversation should have happened while you were waiting with your GF for her ride.\n\nAs far as your GF, she is 100% the AH here. A closed door, to most people, is a universal sign that the occupant does not want to be disturbed and that a knock is required. Moreso in your case, as that is a family rule. Your GF barged in and proceeded to root through your shared closet. When your sister called her out on it, she cursed her and was rude in return.\n\nYour GF owes both you and your sister an apology for not only breaking your house rules, but for her boorish behavior as well. You might want to think long and hard about this relationship; you may be dodging a bullet here.", "NTA. Your girlfriend was out of line. She owes your sister an apology.\n\nHaving a conversation with your girlfriend before making her leave would have been ideal, but inappropriate that you were taken by surprise and had a knee-jerk reaction. Besides, I\u2019m sure your girlfriend is old enough to know that it\u2019s incredibly rude to barge into someone else\u2019s room, to mistreat her boyfriend\u2019s sister, and to disrespect someone else\u2019s home.", "Why exactly are you apologising?\n\nYour GF barges into your sister's room and instead of apologising, doubles down and curses?\n\nOf course you're going to defend your sister.\n\nLeave her to stew. I'd love to think the reason she's gone quiet is because she's ashamed of herself, but somehow, I doubt it.\n\nNTA", "Right?! Im struggling to figure out where the overreaction is? U cursed at my sister - u gotta go simple as that. AFTER barging in and not respectfully asking?!?! Yea u gotta go.\n\nNo one is about to come into my home and disrespect my family. Simple as that. \n\nCould he have made her apologize? Sure - doesnt make his reaction overt.  Doesnt mean the sister would have accepted or wanted her to stay.", "Agreed! Sounds like OP might be dodging a bullet with this one. That is not a normal attitude to have in someone else's house."]}
