I work full time, my bf doesn\u2019t.\n\nTDLR: I do 90% of the chores. My bf is willing to help but wants me to tell him whenever something has to be done. I don\u2019t agree with this so he called me an AH. AITA?\n\nIssue:\nSince we\u2019ve started living together, I\u2019ve done 90% of the chores. I have complained to my bf a few times, telling him I would really appreciate if he could help me and that I would like to come back from work to a clean house.\n\nMy bf has always been willing to help, the issue is that he wants me to tell him whenever I want him to do something. Aka, he wants me to tell him when I want him to cook, clean ect\u2026\n\nA few weeks ago, I started cleaning our apartment on the weekend. I was pretty pissed as I had a very long and stressful week at work. During the week, a pile of dirty clothes had pilled up and a bunch of dirty dishes was in the kitchen. I was pissed that my bf stays at home all day and didn\u2019t clean neither the dishes nor the dirty clothes. While I was cleaning, my bf came to me and told me he was angry that I didn\u2019t tell him I was cleaning, so because I didn\u2019t tell him, he wasn\u2019t able to help me. I broke down and told him I can\u2019t always tell him what to do, that I\u2019m not his mother and that he should be autonomous at his age. After all this, he called me an AH and said I didn\u2019t know how to communicate.\n\nAt the time of this incident, I was also pretty sick. We had nothing in the fridge (I didn\u2019t have time during the week to do grocery shopping as I had been doing 9-7 all week at work). After our fight, I went to take a nap as I had a lot of fever. I woke up in the evening to my bf being pissed because he was hungry and complaining that there was no food in the fridge. I asked him why he didn\u2019t go grocery shopping and cook something and he said he hadn\u2019t think of doing that and I should have tell him that I wanted him to go buy us food. I broke down again and another fight started. I told him that he couldn\u2019t blame me for being hungry when I am already doing all the chores and feels sick. Again, he called me an AH. He said that he is 100% willing to help, but I need to tell him what to do.\n\nI don\u2019t agree with the fact that I should tell him whenever I want him to do something and because of that, my bf thinks I\u2019m the AH. So, dear redditors, AITA?\n\nEdit: I did try to ask him what to do once. An evening I asked him to do laundry the next day. He said he will do it and also go buy a few groceries the next day. I came back home the next day and he hadn\u2019t done the laundry nor the grocery shopping. After that, we got into a fight and I stopped asking him to do things\n\nEdit 2: thanks for all the comments. I learned quite a lot about the mental load and weaponized incompetence (never heard those words before). I will set up a \u2018chores chart\u2019 and give it a month, if nothing changes, I\u2019ll leave", "created_utc": 1673785413, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10cil5n/aita_for_refusing_to_tell_my_bf_whenever/", "score": 3670, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don\u2019t test awareness, but rather observe it in action. When my husband and I were dating and not yet living together, I was extremely busy finishing my degree and working. He would come over to my place, bring groceries, cook healthy meals, and box them up for me to eat during exams. Before I came over to his place, he would clean his room. I don\u2019t mean stuffing things into a closet, but properly cleaning - scrubbing his shower, washing his sheets, etc. If you don\u2019t see someone already capable of doing these things, and already regularly doing them without your influence, don\u2019t move in with them.", "https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/\n\nYour partner has revealed a lack of awareness of domestic responsibilities by demanding you act as the housework shift manager for both of you.

I think you should reread this thread and try your best to imagine it is about someone else\u2019s relationship. If you want to try and mend this bridge with your partner I\u2019d show him that comic and gauge his reaction to decide whether that is a possibility.", "Yeah, I live alone and make my own monthly chore calendar. I try to break it up so I'm doing one small chore a day in manageable steps for my brain but everything still gets clean...it helps me, since otherwise I stare at everything that needs to be done and my brain goes static filled. But like you said, I do that myself.", "my boyfriend called it \"sharing chores\", and he was the one to bring it up. makes me hopeful that maybe he'll do his part properly once we move in together lol", "I'm sure his dick can't be that good, if he even knows how to use it yet.", "Don't forget d) pay 50% of the rent.", "Aww, thanks. We do tend to overshare  with each other sometimes but I'd rather err on the side of over communication than under communication yknow? We aren't even that codependent. A little, yeah, but that's kinda normal for neurodivergent people? It has improved through individual therapy for both of us.", "NTA. Is he mentally challenged? His obliviousness seems extreme", "Jumping on the top comment. NTA. I am in the same situation, I work full time and my bf just finished university and is looking for a job right now so he is at home the whole time. He will help if he sees me cleaning or cooking but it is not something he will do on his own free will. However, he has ADHD and I know that if I want something done, I have to tell him. I will tell him the night before and send him a reminder text the next day just to be sure. He just forgets things, or gets caught up in something else... I can understand the frustration... Is it possible that he has ADHD?", "Label the chart \u201cbasic requirements to being a functional person.\u201d But make it like comic sans with bright colors. When he completes the tasks give him  star stickers to put in the boxes. Tell him if he gets all the stickers for a week he can have a pizza party with one (1) friend from school.\n\nEdit: or tell him picking up after him makes her feel like his mom, and if she\u2019s the mom that means she should be having sex with someone other than him.", "And add the fact that you're doing the mental work for all the chores by making the chart and dividing the work, so he should do more of the physical work. Should be 60-40 at least and that's without taking into account the fact that you work more.", "It didn't occur to him to buy food while the fridge was empty and he was hungry! Thats pretty next level incapable. Has he ever lived independently or has he always mooched of somebody else on the basics?", "Absolutely do not spell this out for him. , you are accommodating a man who is using weaponized incompetence to get out of doing chores.", "You missed the important part. That guy is jobless, he just masturbates all day.", "Damn girl you should come home from work to an apartment that looks like a hotel with a dinner simmering on the stovetop. Dude\u2019s got a whole day of free time on your dime every day\n\nHe could spend three hours straight applying for work and interviewing every day and still have 5 left for grocery shopping, housework, and filling the bathtub with rose petals", "Because the real reason he doesn't do anything will come out...he is lazy", "This is literally my roommate. Needs to be told to empty their cat's box, use trash cans, and flush the toilet after they piss and shit.\n\n\"jUst TEll me whAt tO Do anD i'LL do iT.\"\n\nI'm not going to tell them, Use your five senses and entire brain to assess your environment then watch some TikTok videos about cleaning and learn. And stop using your self-diagnosed problems as an excuse and get some fucking therapy if things are that bad.", "\"keep reminding him\" ? no.  that's the same as asking him to do every single chore.  Soon he'll call her a 'nag,' and the situation will just turn to resentment.  He's calling her bluff, and will absolutely go as far as he can to get away with doing the least.", "Yes, I agree with you. But it seems to me that both you and your partner work together. OP's boyfriend doesn't seem to have the same attitude, and worst, he is insulting OP when the fridge is empty, something he could solve very quickly.", "This! There should be a list, but one written by HIM. He must do his own list and put wherever he would see it. All around their apartment/house, and check every thing he already did.\n\nETA: and also just as taking care of your kids isn\u2019t babysitting but PARENTING. When you live in a place with someone else and that other person put more financially and also does housework, you are not HELPING you have to do as much housework as you can. It\u2019s your responsibility as roommate. You can\u2019t expect someone else to know you are hungry to remind you of doing groceries.", "Then I strongly suggest you buy a pen", "Then YOU can make the list, right?", "If there is a load of dirty dishes in the sink, are you seriously telling me that you need to have it written in a list that you need to wash them?", "So write your own list. Be proactive. But don't put the responsibility of writing the list on another adult. BE an adult yourself. \n\nIf you need the list to be able to follow through, then it's ON YOU to write the list.", "Sure lists are great. I have ADHD - i get it BUT the trick is to make the list you need not expect someone else to do it for your . The bf is just making her responsible for all his needs - shame on him.", "you forget because you procrastinate.", "I have ADHD and I thrive when I make lists, but I make the list because I'm an adult that knows what needs to be done in a home. My husband, on the other hand, does not have ADHD and does not make lists. He buys grocery when there is none, does laundry when clothes need to be washed, loads the dishwasher when there are dirty dishes, and doesn't let the entire household fall apart when I'm sick or working irregular hours. It's literally just adulting.\n\nThe issue here isn't the list/chart itself, but the fact that he wants her to take on the mental load of putting this together for him on top of everything else she's already doing, and trying to make her feel horrible for not doing it.", "Yes, I don't hate them, only wanted to say that the boyfriend is reacting like something not done is somewhat exclusively responsibility of OP. And berating and insulting her, which in my opinion is a big no-no in a couple relationship.\n\nEnglish is not my first language so it could be worded better.", "OP says in the comments that he had maids growing up so that's the reason. It seems like people are \"tripping all over themselves\" to make sure to include every unlikely disability or MH option in the name of inclusivity. Most of the time some important information like that would be included in the post. It's pretty rare that AITA reveals some underlying diagnosis.", "I was responding to your question about why a \"grown ass adult\" would need a chore chart. Yes, they should work together. He is an AH, like I said.", "The only time I would make a list is if there was something new or unusual to do. Otherwise, the main things don't change.", "Exactly! I make myself chore lists if I want to be more organized and motivated to do more things around the apartment, but I'd be super annoyed if I had to make a list for someone else who's old enough to know what chores need to be done around the apartment. I'd rather help them brainstorm ideas for their own list, I think the act of writing down the task helps someone feel real ownership over the work that needs to be done.", "That's because you're what's known as a 'grown ass woman'. This guy can't be bothered to pretend to half-ass anything.\n\nSelf made lists rule.", "Because you are a woman. I know what I need to do, but my husband doesn\u2019t always.  I can ask him to take out the trash, while the recycle is full to overflowing and he will just take the trash.

HOW?\n\nShe said he lived with mom, now he lives with her, what if, just what if, he was babied and pampered and does not know how to do, when to do (literaly does not know that vacuming the floor couple times a week is a \"thing\") and how to offer?\nMost of you are really attacking the guy when she herself says he never refused, always said he needs to be told what, when... \n\nStill he is an AH for calling her an AH when she did not buy groceries, he saw she was sick and fridge was empty, I don't care how pampered he was you do not need to learn in you 20's where groceries in the fridge come from!!", "He's being an asshole, but he's being an asshole for some reason. What I described is at least something that CAN happen, and looks pretty consistent with the boyfriends behavior. The maid thing would be entirely consistent.

My point being not the list itself but why an adult would need that another adult make a list in a romantic partnership.", "I made a list of small tasks I can do when I have some time and feel motivated to do something productive, but don't have the energy for a big decluttering or organizing project. Small, digestible tasks are easier to tackle and really do help keep things clean and tidy.", "No, it's because I am an adult and can figure out what needs to be done myself. Your husband shouldn't need to be specifically asked to take out the trash or recycling when it's full, he should be able to look at it and see that it needs to be taken out.

After all, does OP expect him to just know when to have sex? He needs mummy to hold his hand and help him.\n\nAnd of course, he can't do foreplay without instructions either. He was rich, you know. He can't be expected to know how foreplay works.", "Oh he's been pulling extra duty lately while a grow a tiny human. When it comes to numbers and keeping track of bills, I'm a hopeless mess. And we live in a subtropical environment, I'll play in the flower beds and he can mow and weed whack and hedge all he wants.\n\nAnd his cooking isn't a hobby, 90% of the time he's just finishing up when I'm walking in.

I don\u2019t get stressed and I only have to wash the cookware", "My house has always been very lax about cleaning, but while I was growing up, it was the start of a hoarding issue we already knew my grandparents had. Because of this, I don't always realize how often others want things cleaned nor how bad is too bad.... \n\nNow, when I clean up for others, I think I do a fairly good job (I can detail clean a kitchen damn well better than it looked when I moved in) but something like \"Vacuum at least once a week\" may slip through the cracks if we're living together.\n\nMaking a list together would be great, I think. The obvious things can be on the list along with the specific things that the roommate/flatmate/partner would want that I wouldn't think about.", "Some people need a list from someone else if they can\u2019t figure out what needs to be done", "I LOVE THIS IDEA THANK YOU.", "That honestly sounds wonderful. My husband and I both struggle a lot with this feeling of managing the other one. Sometimes it's helpful to know that someone has your back, but with kids it feels more like just another person to parent. I want to get us to the point you're at, but given that this feels like just another thing to nag him to do, we'd need quite a bit of therapy to get there.", "So these people would live in perpetual filth and starve to death if they lived alone, because they would not know to shop, cook, wash dishes, do the laundry, shower, etc?", "I mean, has she told him to get a job? /s", "I'm dying!

He can look up what is needed to be cleaned in a home, how often, and make his own fucking chart.", "Respectfully, how is he willing to help? Your first edit mentioned that even when you explicitly told him to buy groceries and do laundry, he still refused. When he says he's a helpful partner, he is straight up lying to you.

I was talking from my current reality in which i am the one who takes care of two kids, working a full time job, and actually already doing most of the chores at home but somehow it's not enough for my soon-to-be ex husband who doesn't see anything that is done but nags and name calls for anything that is done instead of doing it himself. \n\nSo I guess my reaction was not so appropriate in this case as I may have misread the rest of the post  about name calling from OP's boyfriend which really has no excuse .", ">Send him back to his mother.\n\nSend him back to his *maid*.", "The key is that you do this together, and neither one of you is taking on a parental role and assigning the other chores.
