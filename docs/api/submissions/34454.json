We have been friends for years now and I love her a lot, she has always been there for me and we've been through a lot together.\n\nThe one thing Tess was the most excited for was her bachelorette, she has been talking about it even before she got engaged (which is why I feel so guilty). I also helped her plan our vegas trip and we were supposed to leave this week.\n\nBut a few days ago, Jason got laid off of work. Even though he saw it coming, it hit him hard. He's just  stressed and really upset. He didn't even tell me at first because he didn't want me to be worried but when he finally told me I just knew I couldn't go anymore.\n\nI was really conflicted, and I knew what this meant to Tess and that I'm the MOH, but I just couldn't even consider going to vegas while Jason is this upset. He's a strong guy but I felt like he shouldn't go through this alone.\n\nI worked up the courage to call Tess and it just went so much worse than I planned. Tess thought I was joking first, and then she just became really angry which is understandable, but I wish she understood my situation too. Tess at first told me to do whatever and cut the call, she didn't respond when I tried contacting her again.\n\nAfter that she sent me a lot of messages saying that I'm stealing her special day, and started questioning why I accepted to be made of honour if I didn't want to do the duties that came along with it. She said I'm untrustworthy  and jealous, that I'm ruining her special moment for a guy I've only known for a year.\n\nI'll admit, I usually don't accept Tess's offers to go clubbing and she blames that on Jason being controlling, but in reality but I've explained that, I just turned into a homebody because I never really enjoyed that stuff in the first place. I  still go out with her a lot, I make sure I'm there for her. But for her bachelorette I was willing to do that and more. I really did want to go and make it special.\n\nShe told me that her whole plan will fall through, because I was the one with the plan. I told her I'll explain it all to one of our other friends.But she said I don't have to because I'm no longer her friend, that hurt a lot to hear.\n\nOne one hand, I don't regret my decision, Jason needs me and Tess should understand how difficult this is for us. But also, this is a once in a lifetime trip, and she has been dreaming about it since forever. I'm also the one who planned a lot of the stuff. Our mutuals also reached out to let me know that Tess was very angry, and that what I did was not cool.Now I'm doubting myself, and I need to know if I have to apologise.\n\nI obviously can't ask anyone I know, Jason thinks I'm right, and I'm sure Derek and the bridesmaids think Tess is right. So that is why this post. Thank you, if you are trying to help me.", "created_utc": 1704551453, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/19016sh/aita_for_backing_out_of_my_best_friends/", "score": 1832, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like what were you doing for him that you couldn\u2019t attend the event because of ?", "I'm sorry, but YTA. Jason can manage himself for a weekend without you, even if he is sad about something. He is a big boy and he can make plans with other friends and family and take care of himself while you are gone. You bailed on your good friend to just sit home and hold his hand. I think you owe your friend a huge apology.", "First, if you honestly believe that tanking a once in a lifetime trip to celebrate a friend's marriage is reasonable because a grown man can't be sad without you for a few days, you need therapy.  I don't want to speculate what issues you might be having, but your thoughts and actions here demonstrate very unhealthy patterns and dynamics.  You need help finding perspective in your life or you're in for a very frustrating time.  \n\nSecond, YTA, a massive, indisputable, flaming AH. If I saw someone make this choice in real life, I would assume they hated their friend and wanted to be removed as MOH and end the friendship. If that's not your goal here, then you need therapy so you don't ruin your other friendships like you ruined this one. Therapy.", "Man. Why can\u2019t I find a guy with a magic penis worth throwing away friendships for?\n\nYTA.\n\nHe lost a job. That he knew was coming.\n\nWhat \u201csupport\u201d does he need? No one is sick. No one died.  He needs to put on his big boy underoos and start job hunting.\n\nIf he can\u2019t handle this for one weekend\u2026 then your co-dependency is off the charts.", "Sorry dear, but YTA.  This is a once in a lifetime event for your long time friend, and you just ditched her for your man.  If he is that fragile that he can't handle a stressful time in his life without you holding his hand (for a very short time while you fulfill a HUGE responsiblity and honour to your friend), then I would give some serious thought to what your life is going to look like in 10, 20 or 30 years when you have no friends left because you just showed them very clearly where they stand in your priority list.", "YTA\n\nJason knew about this for the last 6 months, if Jason doesn\u2019t have himself together enough to endure a hard time without his partner then you need to evaluate your relationship a bit better. \n\nYou prioritizing your partner over your best friend in most situations is understandable but an event like this? Questionable. More context is needed on the duration of your friendship with her and your relationship with him but in all honesty;\n\nPeople get laid off all the time, I understand it sucks real bad but it\u2019s not the end of the world and certainly not a reason he can\u2019t survive by himself for a few days", "YTA, he is bummed about an expected layoff and you're staying home to, what? Make him tea and oat his arm. And your missing your 'best' friend's once in a lifetime event that by most standards you should be organizing and hosting? Knowing that it's a highlight for her? Your priorities are fucked. Staying home is not going to change one thing about your boyfriend's situation but it sure as hell is (rightfully) going to change things between you and the bride.  Please please do an update on this when everything blows in your face, we all deserve the entertainment value of that at your expense.", "Oh, you\u2019re one of THOSE friends. YTA.", "YTA, he saw his job loss coming, it came and now he\u2019s too distraught for you to go on a trip planned 6 months ago? The most important event for your best friend, something you helped plan\u2026 you\u2019re literally one of the most important people to be there aside from the bride as the maid of honor.\n\nI would be furious if I were your \u201cbest friend\u201d too! Jason is a big boy and can handle a switch in jobs without his hand being held 24/7 \ud83d\ude44", "YTA. I thought maybe Jason was in the hospital or his mom died or something. Him losing his job is a problem y\u2019all will be dealing with for a while. Your friend\u2019s Big Dream is a once in a lifetime thing. You\u2019re being a bad friend.", "YTA. You bailed on this trip because your boyfriend was sad. He didn\u2019t even ask you to stay.\n\nYou probably wrecked your friendship and are likely no longer going to be maid of honor.\n\nI really hope this guy was worth a close friendship.", "YTA\n\nHe lost a job not one of his parents.\n\nHe should be spending the time while you are away looking for another one not sulking about it.", "YTA\n\n- Jason saw the layoff coming\u2014meaning he has had the time to somewhat mentally prepare for this. Yes, it\u2019s upsetting, but it sounds like he had time to tell you and for you to respond with empathy and support at least a couple days ahead of the trip, which gives you time to focus on him and be comforting before the trip was supposed to happen, and then again after you return from the weekend. \n\n- Not enough info to judge the validity of whether he\u2019s controlling or not as Jess thinks. I\u2019m also a person who doesn\u2019t enjoy clubbing or being out past 9PM. But if Jason often has personal stuff that comes up when you have plans that result in you cancelling or avoiding to make plans\u2014this is could be red flag territory. \n\n- For you to cancel a months-planned trip, that from what you\u2019ve said, has been the most important part of your role as maid of honor, the circumstances would require more severity than someone else\u2019s sadness over a foresighted layoff.\n\nI\u2019m sure it\u2019s too late for you to really reconcile any of this with your friend, but there were many alternatives you could have taken to ensure your boyfriend was supported and you didn\u2019t let your \u201cbest friend\u201d down last minute:\n- Comfort him in they ways you can while you\u2019re still home\n- Set up some food delivery over the weekend while you\u2019re gone\n- Encourage him to have some time with friends\u2014if you\u2019re close enough to his friends, coordinate this for him on your own\n- Coordinate with your friends to give you a little free time each day during the trip or get up early to take some time to call/FaceTime your boyfriend, so that he knows your commitment to this trip and your friend doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re abandoning all support for him while he\u2019s upset. \n- Recognize the codependency of what he\u2019s asking you to do by encouraging you to skip this trip last minute, and set boundaries in your relationship.", "I am just wondering why Jason needs his hands to be held like a child atm?  \n\n\nHe is not sick. Sure this is tough, but he has to find a solution for it. And since it is no suprise he had time to prepare and find a different job already. Nobody died. He is a grown up adult. He needs to do this by himself. And pampering him isn't gonna solve that problem.  \n\n\nWhy don't  you go to Vegas? He can live on himself for a few days/a week? Yeah it might be rough, but this isn't the end of the world.  \n\n\nYTA. You don't need to babysit him. Have fun in Vegas!", "YTA for not being honest. You never wanted to go to Vegas in the first place. You used him getting fired as an excuse to cancel. This wasn\u2019t an emergency, he knew he was getting laid off. So you both had time to prepare and process it.", "YTA. You really let your friend down. You bf is a grown man and shouldn\u2019t be pulling you away from a good friend just because he is sad.", "YTA and not her friend. Who the f stops a bachelorette just because her BF - not HUSBAND - got laid off? No death in family, no surgery, no life altering event\u2026 just laid off?!?! Like he cant take the time to find another job while ur away?! And this has been planned for months?!?!\n\nPLEASE leave her alone to better friends. You are terrible. YTA. Hope Jason never leaves you since he is more important than everyone else.", "Heavy on the YTA. Your bf is a whole grown a** man. I started this off thinking he was in an accident and needed round the clock care. Not he lost his job \u201cand need someone to hold his hand cause he\u2019s sad\u201d he will get other job prob be fired again and get another one. You are literally choosing his feelings over a responsibility and a friendship you\u2019ve had longer. The fact you even think you she should \u201cunderstand\u201d says a lot about you.", "YTA. Hun, he didn't \"need\" you. He's a grown ass man. There's nothing significant you could have done for him,  and the situation wasn't going to be changed by you being with him. You made a commitment to your friend.", "YTA, and you sound like you\u2019re in a codependent relationship. He lost his job, that sucks. It\u2019ll still suck if you\u2019re there and it will suck when you get back.\n\nIt\u2019s not like he lost his parent, I think this feels like a ridiculous reason to miss a planned trip, especially something so important to your friend. If I were your boyfriend I rooms insist you go. If he\u2019s not pushing you to go, he\u2019s selfish", "What does Jason need you for? I wouldn\u2019t call you an asshole but im definitely looking at you funny.  What does Jason need from you? Emotional support? Assistance applying for unemployment? You could have still gone, and you canceled last minute? Yikes.", "YTA Jason would probably be better off alone with no distractions so he can work on job applications anyway. \n\nI'd be more inclined to agree with your viewpoint if Jason was going through something really hard like losing a family member or close friend. Something like that. But while losing a job sucks, it's not that big a deal. Most people will go through it multiple times in their lives without any need for extra support.\n\nTess on the other hand wants you to be actively involved in one of the biggest things that will ever happen in her life, and you're blowing her off.", "I get it, but I\u2019m leaning toward YTA. This is your best friend and a trip you\u2019ve been planning for months. I\u2019m sure Jason is upset, but he was fine keeping it to himself for your benefit, and he would prob be fine for a weekend with a friend over for support. Wondering why your friend thinks he has controlling behavior, and not enough info to tell if that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here, but you are prioritizing him over your best friend and while getting laid off is tough, it\u2019s not exactly cancel a big trip tough.", "INFO - What is it that has led Tess to think Jason is controlling, exactly?", "YTA,\n\nHonestly, what are you going to do for your boyfriend for that weekend?? Say.. There There and pet his head and ruffle his hair?? \n\nYou're boyfriend can and will manage without you for one weekend, he will still be there and unemployed and upset after a weekend..\n\nA bachelorette party that was a long time in the making..", "Jason should be glad to have a gf like you. However, YTA.  I don't understand what kind of support he needs after getting fired that you can't leave him alone for a couple of days. Your story makes it sound like he's not asking you to stay at first, but then kind of hints that he is. Does he suffer from any major mental health problem that would put him at risk of hurting himself if left alone? Anyway, I'm going off on a tangent here, YTA unless this is quite literally a life or death situation.", "YTA.\n\n>he saw it coming\n\n>He didn't even tell me at first\n\nHe's been dealing with it with it fine for a while, without your help.  \n\nIf you didn't want to go on the bachelorettte then you should have said so. This really sounds like an excuse to get out of it. \n\n> make sure I'm there for her\n\nExcept at her once in a lifetime marriage.", "Info:  Did Jason really need you?  You are saying he is stressed and upset, but I am not seeing anything where he expressed a need or that I see a need expressed.  Did you ask him if it was OK if you went or he would be OK?", "YTA. You\u2019ve ruined one of the best days of your friends life because your bf lost his job that he knew was coming!  I\u2019m struggling to believe this is a true story. I reckon if it is a true story you were ready to bail on your friend whatever excuse came up! I reckon she\u2019s better off without you involved in her wedding", "YTA - it's upsetting to lose a job but he's going to change jobs many times over his life. No one is sick or dying here. You planned this trip WAY in advance, & it's not just a trip, it's a celebration you play an essential role in & your friend is counting on you.", "100% YTA Sounds quite manipulative and a nice silver lining for Jason that you will be with him for the weekend as opposed to out with your mates. If his mental health is not strong enough to handle the loss of a job that he knew was coming he needs to work on gaining some independent coping mechanisms. You should not be his coping mechanism.", "YTA , i know it sucks to lose a job but he needs to get over this . u were already planning to go on the trip .. it means sm to ur friend , jason can handle himself .", "YTA. \n\ni understand you feel like you must be there for your partner, but at the end of the day your presence is not going to help him find a job or make him forget that he was laid off. i\u2019m sure he has friends that could be there for him and comfort him, while Tess doesn\u2019t have another maid of honor. you probably have irremediably damaged your friendship with her.", "YTA- I\u2019m sorry but if your GROWN MAN of a boyfriend cannot deal with his feelings on his own for a weekend, and can\u2019t handle being let go (which you say HE SAW COMING) you need to sit down and think about what that means concerning a life with him as a partner. If every time something bad happens in his life you have to put your whole life on hold to hold his hand through it- oof, you\u2019re in for a rough ride.\n\nYou\u2019re cancelling on something that is most likely a ONCE IN A LIFETIME experience for both your best friend and YOU because you can\u2019t make it up to her, you can\u2019t save that once you throw it away.", "YTA. Jesus dude can't do what alone? He even knew it was coming? \n\nGirl you need to think about this. Had it been a death or something maybe. But what exactly does he need you for? \nHe's sad? Ok. Grow up and move on. \n\nThis bachelorette has been planned for a long time. Are you getting your money back? Because for someone worried about financials and all with a layoff I'd be concerned there. \n\n\nAlso I get being a homebody. I quit drinking almost a year ago and bars and clubs bore me usually. But I went to a friends birthday there. Bc it's about HER. \n\nIf you never go out with her then yea I'm wondering if Jason is controlling. Are you this desperate to keep him?", "Yeah losing your job is hard. Letting down a friend who has always been there for you is gonna lose you a friend and not cure anything for your BF. Pretty sure your BF could handle themselves for this short amount of time. This is really a betrayal of the faith and trust the other person had in you. YTA", "I don't think you will be able to attend the wedding now", "You\u2019re torn between being a good friend and good partner, but your partner isn\u2019t being a good partner likely knowing how much this meant to you/friend and allowing you to stay for something he predicted would happen.\n\nSorry OP, YTA. Apologize to friend dearly.", "YTA. He can be alone for some days, and if he can't he need help that you can't provide.", "YTA, when I started reading I thought your boyfriend had become unwell- which is the only reason you wouldn\u2019t be TA. All because your boyfriend is upset he has lost his job (which he is entitled to feel), you have sacrificed your friendship with a very close friend. So close she asked you to be maid of honour. I don\u2019t know how or if you can make this up to your friend and repair this. I hope it was worth it", "YTA 100% and if your dude guilted and emotionallly manipulated you into making that decision he's an asshole too, and most likely a serious wimp as well.", "YTA. So he needs you to stay home not just for one day but several days for something he's known for months would happen? Did he even try to find another job during those six months? You're being very unfair to your friend. She's not going to invite you to anything else after this.", "Yta.  He\u2019s a grown man.  Cancelling your trip isn\u2019t going to change his job status.  He\u2019s pretty selfish for not encouraging you to continue your plans.", "YTA\n\nYou're skipping your friends bach because your boyfriend got fired? \n\nShe thought you were joking because that's pathetic.", "YTA\u2026he got laid off.  It happens.  And he knew it was coming.  Why wasn\u2019t he prepared for it then? What exactly does he need you for?  What can you do?  Are you going to get him another job?  Either way, he is manipulating you or you are using this as an excuse not to go.  Your boyfriend is not dying or hurt.  You are letting down your friend.", "Sorry going with YTA. I thought you were gonna say someone in his family died and a funeral was coming up. It would suck but I would have a little more sympathy. Losing a job sucks but he is an adult. The only thing he should be doing is looking for a new job. If he got laid off, probably no fault then so he should have good references so he should be able to find one. Idk where you all live and the job marker is messy everywhere but now is the time to act. That's what we adults do. I was sad when I lost my job but I knew I had to find another one. He will be fine for an extended weekend. Tess words were a little harsh but she's speaking out of anger and as you mentioned she has always been there for you but you can't be there for her? You know her better than this and I also feel her words are more than this instance. Make it right OP. Your bf is a grown man. He'll be fine for a few days", "Omg this is kind of funny imo. Getting laid off is bad but not bad enough that he cant even survive a weekend. This feels like such a first world thinking. People literally move countries on their own and start fresh while you are thinking that being laid off is the worst thing poor Jason can go through. YTA.", "I only read to the third paragraph when I made my decision, seeing as all of this was because of a person getting laid off from work(!?)\n\nI was thinking there was some huge medical emergency, or getting rushed to the hospital, or a death in the family\u2026 but a foreseen and *anticipated* job loss??? The funniest part being that you both saw it coming. \n\nYTA and you sound codependent to be perfectly honest, and one of those girls who always chooses a guy over their girlfriends, no matter the case. *Nobody* likes those girls and it\u2019s only a matter of time before your friends will learn this about you and go their separate ways. It\u2019s one of those cases of a girl shutting out all her girlfriends to engorge herself with her boyfriend, only to break up and then wonder why she has no friends.\n\nIf Jason saw this coming then he had plenty of time to prepare. He\u2019s a grown-ass adult and getting laid off from work sucks, but it\u2019s *really* not something to bail on a huge commitment over. And the fact that he didn\u2019t even ask, you just bailed on your own accord because you \u201cfelt like he needed you\u201c is ridiculous. He would\u2019ve been just fine during the weekend without you, probably watching porn, binging movies/playing video games, and eating junk food. He would have been more than fine. \n\nHopefully she bonded with one of the other girls in Vegas and promoted them to Maid of Honor (it\u2019s maid as in maiden/ not made).\n\nEdit to add: saw in someone else\u2019s response that the whole weekend was canceled because OP bailed. No fucking way\u2026 I hope she never speaks to you again. That\u2019s terrible.", "it\u2019s a layoff not a life-changing diagnosis or emergency. You were a bad friend and you need to own that. YTA.", "As a man if I was your bf I wouldn\u2019t let you stay because of me. I\u2019d encourage you to go and have a good time and be the best maid of honor. It\u2019s nice that you want to take care of Jason and be there for him but it\u2019s not the end of the world. We\u2019ve all lost a job in our lifetimes.", "YTA.  This reads like you e been wanting a reason to get out of this trip, so you leapt at the chance when Jason lost his job. I\u2019m also wondering if Jason encouraged you to go, or if he really is controlling you and isolating you from friends?", "Jason need you to do\u2026.what exactly? He got laid off and expected it to happen. YTA", "Let me get this right, you're choosing a man who you've known a 1 year over your BEST FRIEND that you've known for several?  \n\nWithout any once of doubt, YTA and a big big one. Jason is a grown ass man. He can survive a weekend without you. \n\nI feel like it's not the first time you're choosing your SO over your friend, and that's why she has had enough of it.\n\nYou are/were the MOH, so that's fucked up.", "YTA\n\nNow thinking about it, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen someone who prioritizes their SO 1000x over their friends and/or family have a happy healthy relationship. Always ends up in flames.", "YTA of course your bf thinks you're right - you dropped everything for him (sounds like he didn't even ask you to) you made plans and commitments to your best friend and shot it all to hell.", "YTA my partner got laid off last year and I had to navigate that tough situation with him as well but 100% would not have canceled leading my best friends bachelorette because of it. I\u2019d understand unemployment is a long term struggle and usually finding a new job can take up to 6 months. He\u2019d need my support sure, but not me canceling previous plans to sit with him in his sadness.", "From the title alone I was thinking maybe the boyfriend needed emergency surgery or something. But, he\u2019s just sad about losing his job? Girl, nooooo. YTA.", "YTA\n\nYou are choosing your BF over your friend. \n\nThe fact that Jason thinks you are right rather than saying you should go and he will be fine is a big selfish and controlling red flag.", "YTA unfortunately", "There\u2019s no question YTA!  Tess is absolutely correct to drop your sorry ass as a friend, \n\nI hope she\u2019s also kicked you out of her wedding! You don\u2019t deserve the honor of being there on her big day.", "YTA You've been with this guy for 1 year and you blow off your best friend who in your words has always been there for you. He's been laid off ffs not had major surgery. What you planning? To sit and hold his hand and tell him it'll be ok? You suck as a friend.", "Yes, yta.  Your boyfriend is big boy and didn\u2019t actually need you. You chose him over your friend.  That\u2019s fine, but you made a specific commitment to this friend and you\u2019re bailing on that commitment. That\u2019s not very cool.", "YTA. How exactly will holding his hand for three days (or however long the trip was supposed to be) change his laid off status? Is he in danger of self-harming himself?", "YTA - You made a commitment to your friend. I don't understand what you think you can do for your bf at this time, and he shouldn't want you to give up this trip. I don't blame your friends at all for thinking that your bf is controlling, even if he isn't. From the outside, it looks like he is.", "Yes YTA.   It is insulting to both your \"friend\" and boyfriend to act like he is a toddler who can't be alone for a few days.", "YTA. Jason saw it coming and wasn't blindsided. He would've been fine without you for a weekend. I'm sorry, but you made the wrong choice here based on the circumstances. Probably should've asked Reddit before making your decision....", "YTA for all the reasons here and ALSO for wondering if you should apologize.

He doesn't need you to hold his hand 24/7.\n\nYour best friend wants you at a once in a lifetime experience she's been dreaming about for years. A bacchelorette party you planed. That should be a no brainer. \n\nShe's right calling you no longer a friend.", "YTA. This is a ridiculous reason to back out of such an important responsibility to your friend.

You canceled a big Vegas weekend because your bf had the sads? And he supported this, and you still don't think he's controlling? YTA. Your bf is a big boy and can handle his own feelings for 2 days.

Was that worth it?", "NAH. Tess is right to be upset as you agreed to this and you are right to choose to stay with BF if you feel it is necessary. No point in apologizing since she has already ended the friendship. FWIW, I would have gone on the bachelorette trip. People lose their jobs all the time. Adults should learn to cope with what life throws at them. It\u2019s not like someone is seriously ill or died. He lost a job. Someone in a job for 20 years or sole support for a family, yeah that would be hard to cope without some support. But not here.", "YTA, for sure. 100%", "YTA. How would you feel if she did this to you? I imagine you\u2019d be equally pissed.\n\nYour BF knew he was going to lose his job and then he did.

Of course, the expected emotion would be sadness but that is temporary and again, he knew it was coming.\n\nAlso, he KNEW about this in advanced and also NOTE: He did NOT tell you right away as a form of manipulation, controlling, emotional abuse with the timing being BEFORE a big event in your former best friend's life.\n\nNice priorities that you got going on.

I assume he also has family and friends he can reach out to.  You boyfriend is the jerk, it seems like convenient timing that he told you right before the trip (most likely to guilt you into staying). He most likely knew he was going to be laid off for awhile, why is he suddenly so sad because it came to fruition.

No, this is not a good enough reason to ditch your friend!", "YTA for sure. Essentially you were blowing off a planned event that you know wouldn't truly be able to go as planned without you because your boyfriend was sad. That's a tough thing to go through sure, but it's going to be tough for a while, and also we live in a time where you could still keep in touch and offer some emotional support while honoring your commitment. This is not a good enough reason to bow out of such an important commitment.  \n\nThe way I see it this is equivalent to if both your bf and friend were injured in front of you - your bf with a papercut and your best friend with a broken arm - and you gathered up all your attention and the first aid supplies and funneled it right towards your boyfriend.

You could have had him get a room near the hen do and done both check in on him and be there for the festivities. You could have even cut it short but you jumped streight to the nuclear button! You either have an inflated view of your own importance and \"no one else could possibly do to get him through this bump in life\", have a controlling bf or were always going to bail.

Yes he's rightfully upset but it's not like he's unable to be alone. \n\nIt's not healthy if he doesn't want you to go to be with him. If the situation was reversed you should want him to still go. I know I would.\n\nBailing on your friends big event over this is ridiculous. I'm sure you could keep in contact with him over the phone for a weekend away.\n\nOf course your relationship is important but it's not like you are cutting all contact with him while you are away. He's an adult and I'm sure he can cope for a weekend. \n\nIf I was your friend I would be very pissed too and I suspect this is just the latest in a line of you bailing on her for the relationship.

We have been friends for years now and I love her a lot, she has always been there for me and we've been through a lot together.\n\nThe one thing Tess was the most excited for was her bachelorette, she has been talking about it even before she got engaged (which is why I feel so guilty). I also helped her plan our vegas trip and we were supposed to leave this week.\n\nBut a few days ago, Jason got laid off of work. Even though he saw it coming, it hit him hard. He's just  stressed and really upset. He didn't even tell me at first because he didn't want me to be worried but when he finally told me I just knew I couldn't go anymore.\n\nI was really conflicted, and I knew what this meant to Tess and that I'm the MOH, but I just couldn't even consider going to vegas while Jason is this upset. He's a strong guy but I felt like he shouldn't go through this alone.\n\nI worked up the courage to call Tess and it just went so much worse than I planned. Tess thought I was joking first, and then she just became really angry which is understandable, but I wish she understood my situation too. Tess at first told me to do whatever and cut the call, she didn't respond when I tried contacting her again.\n\nAfter that she sent me a lot of messages saying that I'm stealing her special day, and started questioning why I accepted to be made of honour if I didn't want to do the duties that came along with it. She said I'm untrustworthy  and jealous, that I'm ruining her special moment for a guy I've only known for a year.\n\nI'll admit, I usually don't accept Tess's offers to go clubbing and she blames that on Jason being controlling, but in reality but I've explained that, I just turned into a homebody because I never really enjoyed that stuff in the first place. I  still go out with her a lot, I make sure I'm there for her. But for her bachelorette I was willing to do that and more. I really did want to go and make it special.\n\nShe told me that her whole plan will fall through, because I was the one with the plan. I told her I'll explain it all to one of our other friends.But she said I don't have to because I'm no longer her friend, that hurt a lot to hear.\n\nOne one hand, I don't regret my decision, Jason needs me and Tess should understand how difficult this is for us. But also, this is a once in a lifetime trip, and she has been dreaming about it since forever. I'm also the one who planned a lot of the stuff. Our mutuals also reached out to let me know that Tess was very angry, and that what I did was not cool.Now I'm doubting myself, and I need to know if I have to apologise.\n\nI obviously can't ask anyone I know, Jason thinks I'm right, and I'm sure Derek and the bridesmaids think Tess is right. So that is why this post. Thank you, if you are trying to help me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Besides the going to clubs thing, has she mentioned anything else? And when you mentioned you'd stay with him, was he immediately like \"yes\" or did he try to make you feel you could go in a genuine way?\n\nI guess I'm trying to understand if your friend is on to something that you are not seeing or is just projecting.\n\n2 days before Christmas I lost my beloved uncle. My partner was traveling with her mom to spend Christmas eve and day with their extended family in another region. I usually join too and then spend the 26th and 27th with my family, but this year I had decided not to join them on the trip because my uncle was sick and I knew something could happen. As soon as I texted her my uncle passed away she offered to catch a train and come back for support, but I didn't want her to. Her offering to was enough for me. I'm an adult and can cope with sadness for 2 days. I'd never have her lose Christmas with her mom and family to be next to me while I'm sad. I knew she'd be there for me via phone and then she'd come back 2 days after and she was with me all the day of the funeral.When I didn't want her to give up on her plan, I plainly told her not to dare to come back, that I was fine and not to worry. I was genuine and assertive in this and so she felt like she could stick to her plan, and she knew there wouldn't be any repercussion because we don't play mind games with each other.\n\nBefore I was in a relationship with a controlling person who would have given me the silent treatment for days if I didn't give up something to stay with them even if they said it was ok, or they would have used this episode in arguments for months to come. And I couldn't see it at the time.\n\nSo, all of this is just to have you take a serious look at your relationship and make sure your boyfriend is emotionally mature and makes you feel free to do your things without emotional blackmailing.\n\nMaybe I'm totally wrong and you genuinely wanted to be with him over spending the bachelorette weekend in Vegas with your friends, but this is quite extreme in my opinion, unless you don't really like spending time partying with those friends, in which case you could have said you didn't want to take part to this trip from the start.\n\nThen again, everyone's different and every relationship is different. To me, this screams codependency.", "iNFO: how many days are there between you finding out and the actual trip? Does your partner suffer from mental health issues? Is he suicidal?

I love him for that and many other reasons but it also makes it hard sometimes when I\u2019m sad because I don\u2019t need it fixed or need saved. Op definitely needs to consider this too.", "This is a good perspective. People often use their own lived experience to make judgements and sometimes it can be very hard to see past those personal experiences, so it's nice to see multiple perspectives.\n\nMy first thought, due to my own experiences, was that he was doing this on purpose because he doesn't want her to go. This is something my ex fiance would do. It was manipulative, and I didn't recognize it at first. \n\nI used to go out a lot. I had a lot of close friends and we all went out together often. The longer we were together, the less we went out and saw each other. I 100% thought it was my idea. It wasn't until much later that I realized how controlling he was. It got to the point where I couldn't even go grocery shopping at all. But, he never flat out said I wasn't \"allowed\" to go.\n\nThe reason I think it might be a manipulation tactic is because he's known about this, and it happened days ago. He decides to drop it on her right before she's supposed to leave, though. She could have been comforting him for days but now suddenly he let's her know and now she's going to comfort him. If he's been fine for days he'll be fine this weekend.\n\nThis is something my ex would have done, and while he wouldn't have asked me to stay, he would definitely make comments like \"no its fine, you go have fun. I'll just sit here alone and cry by myself while you're out getting drunk and having a great time in Vegas.\" He would make passive aggressive comments that would guilt me into staying. \n\nThe times when I did go out anyway would always turn into a fight, either while I was out, when I got home, or the next day/week. It got to the point where I would make the choice not to go anywhere simply because I knew what the result would be, and it was easier just not to fight. \n\nI ended up losing all of my friends over stuff like this. I missed multiple big milestones like bachelorette parties, weddings, baby showers, birthdays, and engagement parties. If he could come with me, and he wanted to, I could go. If he couldn't or didn't want then I just wouldn't go because it would be a problem. \n\nI just want to emphasize again that it did not start out like this. It was so slow and manipulative that I didn't even see it until it was so bad. There would always be some kind of reason. Like something happened and he was sick or having a hard time. Many times it was him love bombing me and saying he just wanted to spend time with me. Sometimes, it would be him not wanting me to go out with a specific friend because she \"causes drama\" or \"you're different with her.\" \n\nHe'd use his past experience of his ex cheating on him as a reason. I really thought he was being honest and vulnerable with me. \"I just have so much insecurity because of what she did. I'm so scared of losing you the same way and when you go out I get horrible anxiety and it scares me because I love you so much.\" I would end up canceling my plans to prove to him I was different, and I loved him. He'd stop me from living my life, and I not only did it willingly, but rather than being mad, I'd spend the night trying to comfort him. \n\nMy friends called me out on my flakey behavior. They said I'd changed, and I prioritized him. I would make excuses, claim it was all my idea \"because he needs me\" or \"he's just going through something right now.\" I just didn't really see it and I could never have imagined it would get to the point it got to. \n\nNow, obviously, we can't know what exactly is happening here. Maybe he is controlling. She says she doesn't go out with her friends as much and now she's blowing off her best friend's important event that she's a big part of for him. Maybe it's just this one event. Maybe he just doesn't want her going there. Maybe he's fine with it and she is making this choice for herself because she feels the need to go above and beyond to show him she cares about him. Either way she shouldn't do it. She should go with her friend and keep an eye on her/his behavior and their relationship.", "Maybe because an apology isn\u2019t going to fix this.", "People are against OP and will dowmvote anything they post.

Nor would I expect them to. \nI don't think either you or OP are \"wrong\" for your viewpoint but others aren't wrong in suggesting the friend is right to be upset or that OP ruined a close relationship over something that could have been handled better.

(I know it's devastating to lose your pet, I'm an animal lover myself,  but....our dad!!) \n\nHe pulled a similar stunt when our mother was dying, because OMG, there was no food in the house and he had to work and grocery shopping had to be done! For some reason two people were required for grocery shopping. So my sister had to rin herself ragged going home to help him get set for food and then coming back. I'm like, \"um...isn't grocery shopping something everyone has to do? Single people manage... \"\n\nShe goes along with it because he is a manipulative baby.

If you pull this stunt on me, I will reconsider our friendship and trust you less. \n\n(2) I got laid off and I just cried by myself. Jason is a big boy, he can make do.

Then he should have been prepared anyway and looking for other jobs. I would obviously be there for my boyfriend and support him and make sure he\u2019s okay and I would not leave him before I made him his favorite things and talked to him, but I also know he is an adult and doesn\u2019t need me to stop my life and cancel everything I\u2019m doing or had planned just for me to hold his hand ESPECIALLY if it\u2019s for something this important for a friend. I know for a fact my boyfriend wouldn\u2019t want me to cancel on his behalf either, so the fact that your boyfriend was okay with it and wanting you to cancel for him also just leaves me a nasty taste in my mouth. I understand you care or love your boyfriend, but you have other people in your life to think about too and if I was your friend and you told me this. I would drop you as a friend too.

Research \"coercive control\" , and be honest, does this sound like what is happening in your relationship? I am asking this because he \"doesn't need you\", he wants you to be there for him, no one else. Just him. And he has you believing it is your choice to bail on your so-called, but now ex-best friend.

It is not an emergency and your boyfriend is a grown man who can understand the priorities here are for your best friend\u2019s festivities. \n\nEven setting aside friendship and empathy, you are pulling the rug on the whole thing because YOU planned it. This is like if she hired a coordinator/planner and they pulled out last minute because of a non-emergency. \n\nIf you were going to do something like this, you should have declined the role and let someone else step in. Now she\u2019s stressed and can\u2019t even enjoy the trip (which cost everyone money) because the organizer CHOSE not to go.\n\nTBH it sounds like because you don\u2019t really like partying, you\u2019re using your boyfriend\u2019s situation as an excuse to not go.

Any man who would encourage his girlfriend to abandon her long held plans and agreed upon responsibility in order to sit with him when he lost his job is either a malignant narcissist or made of such weak stuff he can not possibly be considered a potential life partner.

It might be true, it might not. Then you\u2019d be scared Jason will be mad (or jealous?) if you go. Is he the jealous type? Would there be repercussions if you went? Is he the dominant one in your relationship?\n\n\nSecond possibility is, that you actually don\u2019t really want to go. And this was the excuse you needed. In that case you\u2019re just a bad friend, and the bride to be is better off without you. But a lousy way to get out of it.

If that\u2019s really true, than your bf needs to grow up and find his confidence in himself, and not demand your presence at home just because he got fired. He expected that, he was prepared. If he still needs you to drop an important plan to just be around, then he has serious problems. And if you go along with it, so do you.
