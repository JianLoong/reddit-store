It would be crazy if you made a decoy lunch one day and put laxatives in it. Told him this is yours and not to steal it.  Of course, don't do that (wink) but wouldn't that be crazy?", "I hope your bags are packed. You're right to be angry. He's being a Ass. NTA", "NTA.  Do you need help packing?", "Here\u2019s my take: I\u2019m a lot older than you and I\u2019ve never seen a man walk back from \u201cit\u2019s my house and I\u2019ll do whatever I want.\u201d Laughing off your reasonable request to leave your lunch alone is disrespect. Do not expect this man to ever respect your time or your effort or your personal property. Look around and ask yourself if he redirects anything about you. \n\nAre you good with dealing with this ten years from now? If not, walk away. \n\nNTA.", "NTA and I see 2 solutions.\n\n1: Since you go in later, make your lunch after he leaves for work.\n\n2: Stop being his girlfriend.", "I\u2019m glad that you said point 1 since my immediate thought reading this was that OP\u2019s boyfriend is playing a weird game of chicken to get her to make him lunch so he \u201cwins\u201d.", ">3 stop making her own lunch. All the points under 2 still apply.\n>4 lock her lunch box. All the points under 2 still apply.", "This red flag isnt tiny. It's big but it seems the lpve has given op short sightedness. Consider us/thisnyour Specsavers apt (Brit humour) and hopefully Op now you can see.\n\nAs wellnas the above I say this, you have 2 choices.\n\n1. Stay. He has shown who he is and thathe wont change despite you asking nicely. Also, as wonderfully explained above, he does not respect you. So if you stay know this is the best it will be. He may promise to change and may even do sp for a while (think weeks, maybe even a month or two). But this wont be sustainable as he is lacking in the core foundation of the change - he does not respect you therefore will only change till you relax and get comfortable and go back to his ways.\n\n2. Leave. I say this with kindness - Get therapy, learn to love and respect you and not allow people to disrespect or accept less than the bare minimum from people. You deserve to be respected, you deserve to be loved and appreciated. This man does not.\n\nBeing single and lonely is much better than being with someone like him.", "Her making him lunch shouldn't be an option, IMO. It'll show him he can get away with things and that she'll do it for him. Or he'd just take his lunch and still eat half of hers. His only options should be to grow up and make his own lunch or get out if she can't find a place for her lunch that he can't get to.", "Preach", ">he really doesn't respect you, period\n\nThat's the important point.", "Where is \u201cget a lock for your lunchbox\u201d option? XD\n\nI\u2019d dump his ass tho, I can\u2019t stand the thought of my SO being cool with me going without food.", "Or 3.) do option 2 followed by option 1!", "I bet he's the kind of guy that would take revenge on her prank, either by tossing her lunch the next day or spiking her food.", "What about some nice laxatives.", "THESE are the only choices.", "I have a link to a 9 million Scoville hot sauce. Just saying....", "My absolute grabbed out of nowhere total assumption is it may be he thinks he deserves to be looked after like his momma used to? His behaviour screams entitlement to her labour and possessions. I\u2019d be running.", "Because this is a made up story. No one is this much of a pushover that it's taken until now for them to say something.", "That last line is a disturbing visual, thanks. (shudder)", "I'd suggest you follow one of the suggestions on here and make a prank lunch for him to enjoy.", "If you are contributing to the grocery, it's fine. Or you could just say you needed something to eat, because he ate the lunch you paid for.", "I mean, he might still eat her lunch even if she makes him one. He\u2019s conditioning her to lower her boundaries.", "I thought of that. But he isn't taking her lunch as his own. He's eating it before he leaves to be passive aggressive.", "[deleted]", "3- Why should she have to spend more money to buy her own food?\n\n4- I like the idea, but I wouldn't put it past him to hide it in a \"if I can't have it, no one can\" ploy.", "The smart way is typically hot sauce. It's food so it doesn't count as poison.", "This one. This is the answer.", "That\u2019s why she\u2019s got to leave him immediately after, ideally, while he\u2019s still suffering.", "From a legal stand point, easier to argue an actual food product. \n\nFrom a psych perspective, we need immediate cause and effect to have any real cognitive impact as delays may result in non-target effects. \n\nDon't ask me how I know.", "Nah, laxatives are usually reserved for cheaters", "Dated a dude who would eat food he didn't like just because he helped to get it (bringing it home, not even paying for it)\n\nIt was a display of dominance", "People that behave like this don't do it all at the start.\n\nIt starts with small things, ends up worse than this.\n\nIt doesn't mean that this is made up.", "It happens, sometimes it takes certain people longer to get a backbone. Sometimes people are slowly abused into losing their sense of self. There's many reasons for why it could happen, in this case she asked him every time he did it to stop and then finally snapped. I'm not sure that's being a pushover, she tried to get him to stop and he wouldn't and now she should leave.", "That his ass eats lunch, or that he eats ass for lunch? Equally disturbing.", "He doesn\u2019t sound like the sort of person I\u2019d want to enrage", "#4 should be #1", "I\u2019d go with the 4th option. This behaviour is a massive red flag. He is doing this deliberately to be a controlling dick.", "Right. I think leaving the half-eaten food and wrappers in her lunch box is definitely some kind of power move. He wants her to know what he\u2019s done. Once he gets her to back down on this, he\u2019ll move on to something else until he controls her completely", "It's his house, not yours. His food, not yours. His, his, his. You don't seem to care much for him. He is literally stealing food from your mouth.", "I was thinking he would probably eat hers for breakfast and take the one she made him with him if she started making his", "Not incompetence. He's establishing dominance. He  doesn't take it; he eats it before leaving and leaves the wrappers for her to clean up.", "Nah, that would be him claiming he can't make a sandwich so she needs to do it for him\n\nDefinitely dominance.", "Yes, it feels like that here too.", "In regards to dominance, my first thought was this is about control. I have a family member who takes other\u2019s food, eats off other\u2019s plates, will take a piece of pizza right out of a person\u2019s hands. He does it to his kids and his wife. It\u2019s all about control and dominance, and he wants to make sure that his family isn\u2019t going eat their food or experience joy or satisfaction in their meals. OP is far from TA, and if I have any advice it\u2019s fucking leave and never look back. This shit will escalate into making your life miserable.", "Put a \\\\ in front of the \\# to stop from making it into \n\n#this.", "This is a very good comment. It is bizarre behavior so why is he doing it? The first instinct is to say move out and move on but that could very well be what he wants", "Ok. Add laxatives THEN dump his ass.", "Leaving the trash in her lunchbox for her to find when she gets to work is so insulting.  This guy doesn't respect her at all.", "What about the finances in HIS house? When will your money become HIS money if not already? Imo you are already suffering some form of abuse. No one does that and then addresses their SO with such open contempt. I would have gotten out same day!!", "It's the leaving of wrappers that really does it for me. \"Imma take part of your lunch and in case you forgot what you packed, I'm leaving the trash with the uneaten food.\" Dude can fuck right off.", "This is the right direction.", "Not laxatives - ghost peppers", "It's just this side of peeing in her lunchbox to show ownership. Definitely a power/control move."]}
