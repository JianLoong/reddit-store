That last bit told me everything I need to know. He's eating your lunch not because he doesn't have other options but solely because he can and you can't stop him. It's about power and control and who has it in this relationship. It's his house, not yours. His food, not yours. His, his, his. You don't seem to be much a consideration for him.
