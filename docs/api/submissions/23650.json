At first it was a friend I knew and he started talking to her for about a month before confessing and she shot him down. I don't think they ever talked after that. We weren't real close that year but anytime we talked it was about some girl I didn't know. \n\nIf I told the full story I would run out of characters but in around two years he had at LEAST 20+ crushes and only one he actually stayed on for more than two weeks. In that time he made trying to have a girlfriend be his entire personality. \n\nHe moved away about a year ago and we still texted but he told me about his \"love life\" and safe to say he did not slow down.\n\nHe really showed how he operated when he once asked me \"Who should I like next?\" which told me he's not some romantic person whose emotions blinded him to logic and common sense, but he was just trying to check a box. He downloaded a dating site to try and get a girlfriend who he couldn't even meet in person. He kept wanting for us to call and wanted me to tell him if he should swipe right on these girls based off their looks.\n\nAnyways he has been spiraling more and more into crazed desperation for some \"human connection\" and even went as far to \\*shudder\\* join a Discord dating server. There he met a girl who lives within two hours of him and was very flirty. He said they had been talking for two days or so but they stayed up late last night texting and I won't go into detail about what he told me but he used the phrases \"sexual frustrations\" and \"shaking with libibdo\". I reacted how most would which is of course creeped out. He denied she could be an adult man and asked why I wasn't supportive. Now I have made no secret about how unhealthy I think his obsession with dating is, but yesterday I didn't back down. He didn't offer much of an argument besides trying to devaluate my input since I have never been in a romantic relationship either and he has a friend he trusts with ALL of this stuff  since he had a girlfriend once for a week. (Not going into detail but this other guy is creepy). I've encouraged him to talk to his parents more since there horror will make more of an impact than mine but he has denied to do so. It got to the point where I asked if he really wanted my opinion and he said yes and I told him my opinion and it turned out he did not want my opinion. He got very upset that I didn't think he managed to be in love with a new girl every week but I refused to apologize since he asked for opinion in the first place. I'm not trying to hurt his feelings, but its unhealthy for him and I'm pretty confident creeps out any girls he's near. He is the epitome of insanity is doing the same thing over and over expecting things to change.

I presume his personality is the main the reason that all of his crushes were never anything more. Ask your friend what exactly he wants in life, like what is he long term goal in his love quest and what will happen if he finds a girlfriend that will stay with him.\n\nAt the very least it\u2019ll be a good look into whatever pudding he\u2019s stirring up there, definitely won\u2019t taste good though.", "NTA. Dude's definitely obsessed and yes, creepy is the right word. He could be addicted to the dopamine from NRE or the dopamine from the \"chase\", extremely unhealthy and he probably can't form proper emotional connections, either platonic or romantic. \n\nYou told him, there's nothing more you can do. We can't fix other people, we can only support them while they fix themselves. If they don't want to do that, being around them long term will be harmful to the people around, and they'll usually end up alone. Sometimes hitting rock bottom is enough to get them to get therapy/health/do shadow work. Other times nothing is.", "imageine shaming a man for doing the best to geta  gf and calling it desperate \n\nwell he is desperate", "Is Dat all you lowlifes do ovah here is sit around and talk about cooze?", "YTA because you don't sound concerned, you sound judgmental and condescending.\n\nWho knows why he's like that, maybe low self esteem, maybe he's lonely (or maybe he also wants to get laid).\n\nIf it bothers you that much suggest to talk about other things. If he can't, you can scale back on contact.\n\nBut the way you come across you might not be the right person to give him a 'healthy talk'.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There is more to life than woman and if he doesn't figure that out and find happiness outside relationships then he will break apart from lack of self worth eventually. This is weird almost pathetic behaviour it'll only get worse. You are just looking out for a brother. Youre in the right. Good job OP.", "Nta", "I have a friend like this, except he's forty.  -_-  I don't really have any advice (other than distancing yourself until he can find anything else to talk about), but no, you're NTA.", "he is just lonely and deprived  of attention", "Point him towards Dr. NerdLove. I think there's a lot in the archives that he could benefit from and DNL's writing style is very entertaining.", "NTA. It\u2019s okay not to surround yourself or orbit around romance. Your friend seems to have gotten so deep into seeking romance (in such creepy ways too) that he forgets that people need connection in order to build anything else on it eg friendships or romances.\n\nI\u2019ve seen too many guys like these lately, and all I can say is that other ppl\u2019s experiences and mine feel more and more similar to a vessel that happens to be ppl\u2019s gender of preference than any solid person or human being. Basically, it doesn\u2019t matter to them who or how special each person is, as long as they can play out their stories at them.\n\nBefore sexual desire or romantic attention, we are human beings. It\u2019s not a thing where u should tell him to despise these love interests or pursuing love in general, but this is.. extreme. I don\u2019t know how else to phrase this but.. women and men and people in general aren\u2019t here for these ppl to obsess for or despise to be able to find themselves. Before anything, we are people, not an object by the display window. I think you cd explain it better when u explain or reword it.\n\nI think we don\u2019t have to put down or despise others or put anyone on a pedestal for us to work on ourselves.\n\nIt\u2019s a dehumanising experience on both ends. I can get you really care and have a sense of what\u2019s right and wrong. Though if it seriously stresses you out beyond the edge, you should distance yourself from him. At best, you\u2019re at a standstill while still stressing the life out of you for him. Good luck OP \ud83e\udee1\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb", "^This OP!

As for talking about other things I made him agree to never talk to me about girls again.\n\nJust thought to add this I didn't convey a lot of emotion or sentiment in the post because I went over the letter limit multiple times but I really do feel bad for him and that's why I did what I did.", "Nah, you need friends that'll tell you the truth, even when it sucks to hear.
