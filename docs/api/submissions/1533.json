My husband was a widower when we met. His kids were 6 and 8 when I came into their lives. Their mom had been dead about a year. They and I get along really well and our relationship is pretty solid. But they have always asked that I be stepmom and not mom. My husband was a little bothered by this in the early days because he wanted them to be open to the chance for me to be mom as well. I told him not to push it and not to see it as them closing off, but rather honoring the woman all three of them loved, who was irreplaceable. I thought he was fully over it but now I'm not so sure.\n\nMy 6 year old has started to ask questions about why his older siblings call me by their name, why we say I am not their mom, and I have explained it to him, showed him the photos of his siblings mom so she's more real for him and it makes more sense. I have explained that it hurts their feelings and makes them feel like their mom is being replaced when someone says I'm their mom. But the other day I caught him correcting them and telling the kids I'm their mom and they were being mean. I told him to stop. I took him away from the situation and explained why he shouldn't do that but he continued and so I put him in time out. He was upset. He told me he didn't like that they were being mean to me. I told him they weren't mean. They were being honest.\n\nMy husband wasn't thrilled I put our son into time out over it. I told him we can't have him pushing back against the truth and letting it come between everyone. He said it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world if the kids accepted me as their mom. I told him it wouldn't, but it can never be forced. My son ended up telling my ILs about it and they were furious. They claimed we let the older kids get away with dismissing the fact I have mothered them longer than their own mom and that my son isn't wrong to insist I am their mom too.\n\nI was angry at them for thinking that way. My husband, I know, still feels torn.

Thank you for respecting your kids feelings. You may not be their mom but they are your kids. Being a parent, whether step or bio comes with emotional pain. If it's not \"I'm not comfortable calling you mom\" it's hearing them favor the other parent over you. Kids are people with thoughts and feelings. If an adult didn't return your feelings and you tried to force a relationship on them, that would be called stalking. I don't get why some adults can't see why it's wrong with kids.", "NTA - Kudos to you for being so respectful throughout the entire thing!\n\nYes, your son is young, and it\u2019s bound to confuse him. But it wasn\u2019t okay to push that onto your step-children. That takes time, especially for younger children.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your 6 year old needs to listen but they're also just 6 and probably just don't fully understand yet so I would keep correcting without trying to punish because they're just trying to stick up for their mommy and talk to the older ones and tell them that the 6-year-old doesn't fully understand that you're not their mom and that they should just try and ignore them but if it bothers them ever to let you know", "NTA. Your son \u201ccorrecting\u201d them isn\u2019t going to make a difference in how they feel in a good way. By respecting their boundaries and showing them you respect their boundaries you did the right thing. They don\u2019t have to call you \u201cmom\u201d to love and respect you. They are not being mean. I\u2019m so glad you get that!", "NTA. I'd ask your son why he thinks it's mean. I'm curious if he's picking up on your husband's vibes.", "NTA Imagine how the kids feels.( the older ones) They dont want to replace their mom and other people should get that! Its things like this ( pressing the kids to call you mom) that will make the relationship broken! They love you as there stepmom that dosen\u2019t need to change! If the relationship they have with you now is good in their eyes why should it change? \n\n(Sorry if it sounded harsh in some meanings) \nI think you made some really good points and your motives are good.\n\u2022 You cant force kids to call someone mom when they dont want to.", "NTA. We\u2019ve all seen the posts where a step parent pushes a parental role oh children who have lost a parent. It never goes well. We also see tons of posts about half siblings bullying the others into calling the stepparent mom or dad. That also never goes well. Good for you for being an actual step parent to your step kids and protecting them. You are a good parent/step parent", "Hey, don't take this the wrong way; I'm not calling you an asshole or making you feel horrible about it on purpose. Simply put, your kid is in a developmental stage when things aren't as clear to him as they are to you. This means that no matter how many times you try to explain things to him, he won't fully understand them. He is only standing up for you; I don't believe he should be punished. I understand how it feels to defend your own mother and keep others from mistaking you. If you give him a chance, he will finally accept them calling you by your name.", "Nta", "Easy NTA, you\u2019re handling this in the most respectful manner possible. Your husband is being driven by his emotion without thinking of his kids feelings - which is wrong. Also his parents are way out of line.", "nta", "NTA, and good lord. How ironic that you seem to be the only person in this situation who is *actually* loving your stepkids as they are, not as you want to force them to be. *That* is how you mom, not by forcing the title.\n\nYour husband needs to be a united front with you on this matter. I have to think part of the reason your son feels so empowered to correct his elder siblings is because Dad is encouraging it -- perhaps deliberately, perhaps unconsciously, I don't know. I know people sometimes roll their eyes at the suggestion of couples counseling (or it isn't accessible) but if at all possible, I think this is exactly the kind of situation couples counseling is suited for. You seem to have a functional family but you have this one highly emotional issue that could perhaps benefit from being talked out in front of a neutral third party.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is HIS decission, and his siblings NEED to stop harassing him.", "NTA\n\nThis is a tough situation for everyone. I feel for your son because all he\u2019s doing is looking out for you. I feel for you because you don\u2019t want this to be forced, you want to help them feel comfortable to accept you fully. I feel for them because losing a mom that early in life is very painful. The only advice I can give is to have weekly family night. Have it be intentional no tv or phones. Just the family having fun together playing board games or doing an interactive activity. Show them love through intentional family interaction, hopefully through this all your kids will learn how to live and accept. Good luck!", "NTA - It's so rare to hear of a step parent who not only doesn't try to manipulate stepkids into using the parent title, but openly defending them from those who try enforce it for you. This is unbelievably respectful of you and those ILs are the AH's. Your son needs to learn to respect others relationships, which is a valuable lesson to teach early.", "NTA. I don't have kids so I don't think this is worth anything, but if I were the late wife in this scenario I would be glad that my kids ended up with such a respectful and considerate step mum. And if anything happened to my mum and I had a step mum who forced me to see her as my mum, I would be really pissed off and most likely want nothing to do with my step mum (or dad for that matter) once I left home. \n\nYour biological kids are young and most likely confused about the situation. It's you and your husband's job to teach them what is appropriate, which is what you're trying to do.", "NTA - shouldn't this ultimately be your decision if you want more recognition by kid 1&2?\n\nI think I wouldn't have engaged in a kid fight like that. Sometimes it's best to let them work it out between themselves. By stomping on it hard like you did, you're giving the subject more attention then it should warrant. If everyone ignored it, it would probably be down by the kids soon enough.\n\nThe more disturbing thing for me is the behaviour of your husband and in-laws. If I were to venture a guess, your kid is picking up on something that your husband or in-laws say, do or demonstrate and that is why the kid is so fixed on the idea.\n\nThe whole fight seems weird with you doing more to honour the memory of the deceased wife then the rest of the family.", "NTA", "OK let's take the emotive 'mom' stuff out of it for a second.\n\nYou explained to your kid that what he was saying was hurtful and he shouldn't say it. Then you explained again why he can't say the hurtful thing. He refused to stop saying the hurtful thing, so he got timeout.\n\nThis seems like perfectly fine parenting to me.\n\nAs to your step kids, they are what, mid-teens now? They're perfectly old enough to make choiices and voice opinions on this. If you're happy and they're happy, your husband's opinion really is the lesser of all the people involved here, and I truly don't understand why he would want to stir up trouble about it. His in-laws can stay the hell out of it, what makes them think they have a say here?\n\nNTA\n\nEdit to add:  while I see nothing wrong with the timeout it may be that your son is struggling with the idea that tif you're not 'mom' then that means you're not all a family or that they don't love you or whatever and he doesn't like the idea. So a further reassurance seems needed on that front.", "I truly commend you for taking this approach. NTA at all and I'm sure the step kids are extremely grateful", "NTA. I don't think it should be necessary to punish your child for it. Just keep telling all these people that you are who you are and you don't need honorary titles for being you. The eldest children had a mother and of course they don't want her title to go to you. And you don't care. The real problem is that your husband, your in-laws and your son seem to care. Perhaps they need to speak to a professional about it. It is really weird that they find it so important.", "NTA and thank you for intervening now so we don't see any \"AITA for not inviting my younger step brother who tried to make me call his mom 'Mom' to my wedding?\" posts in 20 years.", "Six is old enough to understand consequences for doing something are told not to do.", "THIS THIS THIS!! You are protecting your step kids and being an amazing step mother. Your husband needs to get on board.", "Except, the teens (OP's step kids) are half siblings to the younger two.", "My bad, the post we've been saved from is \"AITA for not inviting my younger brother to my wedding?\""]}
