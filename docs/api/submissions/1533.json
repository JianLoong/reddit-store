Thank you for respecting your kids feelings. You may not be their mom but they are your kids. Being a parent, whether step or bio comes with emotional pain. If it's not \"I'm not comfortable calling you mom\" it's hearing them favor the other parent over you. Kids are people with thoughts and feelings. If an adult didn't return your feelings and you tried to force a relationship on them, that would be called stalking. I don't get why some adults can't see why it's wrong with kids.", "NTA - Kudos to you for being so respectful throughout the entire thing!\n\nYes, your son is young, and it\u2019s bound to confuse him.

Your 6 year old needs to listen but they're also just 6 and probably just don't fully understand yet so I would keep correcting without trying to punish because they're just trying to stick up for their mommy and talk to the older ones and tell them that the 6-year-old doesn't fully understand that you're not their mom and that they should just try and ignore them but if it bothers them ever to let you know", "NTA. Your son \u201ccorrecting\u201d them isn\u2019t going to make a difference in how they feel in a good way. By respecting their boundaries and showing them you respect their boundaries you did the right thing. They don\u2019t have to call you \u201cmom\u201d to love and respect you. They are not being mean. I\u2019m so glad you get that!", "NTA. I'd ask your son why he thinks it's mean. I'm curious if he's picking up on your husband's vibes.", "NTA Imagine how the kids feels.( the older ones) They dont want to replace their mom and other people should get that! Its things like this ( pressing the kids to call you mom) that will make the relationship broken! They love you as there stepmom that dosen\u2019t need to change! If the relationship they have with you now is good in their eyes why should it change? \n\n(Sorry if it sounded harsh in some meanings) \nI think you made some really good points and your motives are good.\n\u2022 You cant force kids to call someone mom when they dont want to.", "NTA. We\u2019ve all seen the posts where a step parent pushes a parental role oh children who have lost a parent. It never goes well. We also see tons of posts about half siblings bullying the others into calling the stepparent mom or dad. That also never goes well. Good for you for being an actual step parent to your step kids and protecting them. You are a good parent/step parent", "Hey, don't take this the wrong way; I'm not calling you an asshole or making you feel horrible about it on purpose. Simply put, your kid is in a developmental stage when things aren't as clear to him as they are to you. This means that no matter how many times you try to explain things to him, he won't fully understand them. He is only standing up for you; I don't believe he should be punished. I understand how it feels to defend your own mother and keep others from mistaking you. If you give him a chance, he will finally accept them calling you by your name.", "Nta", "Easy NTA, you\u2019re handling this in the most respectful manner possible. Your husband is being driven by his emotion without thinking of his kids feelings - which is wrong. Also his parents are way out of line.", "nta", "NTA, and good lord. How ironic that you seem to be the only person in this situation who is *actually* loving your stepkids as they are, not as you want to force them to be. *That* is how you mom, not by forcing the title.\n\nYour husband needs to be a united front with you on this matter. I have to think part of the reason your son feels so empowered to correct his elder siblings is because Dad is encouraging it -- perhaps deliberately, perhaps unconsciously, I don't know. I know people sometimes roll their eyes at the suggestion of couples counseling (or it isn't accessible) but if at all possible, I think this is exactly the kind of situation couples counseling is suited for. You seem to have a functional family but you have this one highly emotional issue that could perhaps benefit from being talked out in front of a neutral third party.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is HIS decission, and his siblings NEED to stop harassing him.", "NTA\n\nThis is a tough situation for everyone. I feel for your son because all he\u2019s doing is looking out for you. I feel for you because you don\u2019t want this to be forced, you want to help them feel comfortable to accept you fully. I feel for them because losing a mom that early in life is very painful. The only advice I can give is to have weekly family night. Have it be intentional no tv or phones. Just the family having fun together playing board games or doing an interactive activity. Show them love through intentional family interaction, hopefully through this all your kids will learn how to live and accept. Good luck!", "NTA - It's so rare to hear of a step parent who not only doesn't try to manipulate stepkids into using the parent title, but openly defending them from those who try enforce it for you. This is unbelievably respectful of you and those ILs are the AH's. Your son needs to learn to respect others relationships, which is a valuable lesson to teach early.", "NTA. I don't have kids so I don't think this is worth anything, but if I were the late wife in this scenario I would be glad that my kids ended up with such a respectful and considerate step mum. And if anything happened to my mum and I had a step mum who forced me to see her as my mum, I would be really pissed off and most likely want nothing to do with my step mum (or dad for that matter) once I left home. \n\nYour biological kids are young and most likely confused about the situation. It's you and your husband's job to teach them what is appropriate, which is what you're trying to do.", "NTA - shouldn't this ultimately be your decision if you want more recognition by kid 1&2?\n\nI think I wouldn't have engaged in a kid fight like that. Sometimes it's best to let them work it out between themselves. By stomping on it hard like you did, you're giving the subject more attention then it should warrant. If everyone ignored it, it would probably be down by the kids soon enough.\n\nThe more disturbing thing for me is the behaviour of your husband and in-laws. If I were to venture a guess, your kid is picking up on something that your husband or in-laws say, do or demonstrate and that is why the kid is so fixed on the idea.\n\nThe whole fight seems weird with you doing more to honour the memory of the deceased wife then the rest of the family.", "NTA", "OK let's take the emotive 'mom' stuff out of it for a second.\n\nYou explained to your kid that what he was saying was hurtful and he shouldn't say it. Then you explained again why he can't say the hurtful thing. He refused to stop saying the hurtful thing, so he got timeout.\n\nThis seems like perfectly fine parenting to me.\n\nAs to your step kids, they are what, mid-teens now? They're perfectly old enough to make choiices and voice opinions on this. If you're happy and they're happy, your husband's opinion really is the lesser of all the people involved here, and I truly don't understand why he would want to stir up trouble about it. His in-laws can stay the hell out of it, what makes them think they have a say here?\n\nNTA\n\nEdit to add:  while I see nothing wrong with the timeout it may be that your son is struggling with the idea that tif you're not 'mom' then that means you're not all a family or that they don't love you or whatever and he doesn't like the idea. So a further reassurance seems needed on that front.", "I truly commend you for taking this approach. NTA at all and I'm sure the step kids are extremely grateful", "NTA. I don't think it should be necessary to punish your child for it. Just keep telling all these people that you are who you are and you don't need honorary titles for being you. The eldest children had a mother and of course they don't want her title to go to you. And you don't care. The real problem is that your husband, your in-laws and your son seem to care. Perhaps they need to speak to a professional about it. It is really weird that they find it so important.", "NTA and thank you for intervening now so we don't see any \"AITA for not inviting my younger step brother who tried to make me call his mom 'Mom' to my wedding?\" posts in 20 years.", "Six is old enough to understand consequences for doing something are told not to do.", "THIS THIS THIS!! You are protecting your step kids and being an amazing step mother. Your husband needs to get on board.", "Except, the teens (OP's step kids) are half siblings to the younger two.", "My bad, the post we've been saved from is \"AITA for not inviting my younger brother to my wedding?\"", "Good heavens, he's SIX he can handle a time out lol. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nBut I doubt at 6 he's come up with all by himself, especially given your husbands and inlaws reaction.\n\nIt doesn't matter how long you've been their 'mother'. Their mum died, she didn't leave. Your respecting their wishes and boundaries more than their father and his family.", "NTA. Thank you for seeing your stepchildren glas humans that have the right to remember their mother, that's sadly rare on this page.", "NTA.  The 6 year old is trying to process something a little bit complex (emotions around death), but he's old enough to start learning that someone saying something is hurtful is often reason enough to stop doing it.  Your husband and ILs are well past old enough to learn that.  Also, your son did not follow direct instructions from a person in authority, reasonable consequences often come after that decision.", "NTA.\n\nYou appear to be the only one who acknowledges and respects your step children's history. You are not their mother. While it's not unheard of for kids to call a stepmother \"mom\" when the mom has died and they were young, it's not exactly standard either. And they were old enough to have real memories of their mother.\n\nPlease stand firm. You aren't punishing your child for \"standing up for you,\" you are punishing them, appropriately I think, for doing what they were told not to do. You may need to have a continuous conversation for a while about how your family was made, and make sure your kids don't think you are being hurt when the others call you by your name.", "NTA.  My dad died at 12, it anyone had expected me to think of my mom's subsequent parter as \"dad\".I would have hated him even more.  What words they use to talk about you don't matter we much as the emotions behind them.  If anyone might be the AH, it'd be your husband for expecting them to call you mom due to an irrelevant amount of time passing.", "NTA \n\nThe one thing that got me is the in laws claims, like \n\n>dismissing the fact I have mothered them longer than their own mom\n\nThat is a very sick thing for anyone to say. Clearly if the mother was a deadbeat or something then maybe but she died. She didn't choose to leave them so to make a comment like that is a disgusting thing to do and very manipulative.\n\nYou seem to be handling it quite well by talking and explaining to your the situation and I'd imagine as he gets older he will understand. But he's 6, he probably isn't comprehending half of what your explaining and it's probably why he's going around in circles trying correct his older siblings, not understanding what he's actually correcting.", "NTA,  not even a little bit.  I might not have gone as far as a time out,  and I get why your 6yo feels there's a divide,  but he doesn't remember a time when you weren't all a family,  and the older kids do. It's important for the older kids to acknowledge their mother,  and you know that they love you. That's all that matters.  Those children are all lucky to have you.", "NTA but I get the feeling that someone is telling him that this is disrespectful and he should correct them. And it might be a bit unfair to him if he just follows advice of a third person. I would try to explain to him how he would feel if someone would replace you to try to give him empathy for how they are feeling.", "NTA. The request to your son was reasonable and explained in an age-appropriate way. Your son was told what the acceptable behavior was, went against it, got a warning, got a consequence. \n\nAre you sure your husband isn't encouraging your son? He seems mighty eager to jump on his misbehavior to push his own desires.", "Nta... to much value is placed on a name!  How are your relationships, how do you treat each other and how do y'all like living together?   That's what matters. Why does everyone seem so caught up on what we call each other... not directed at OP. Great job validating step-kids on what their comfortable with, talking/walking your 6yr old thru this situation and keep up the communication!", "NTA and lots of hurt people around, and your husband is TA for not getting appropriate grief counseling and parenting his children wrong. You and your step-kids are spot on on this.\n\nYour husband NEEDS to urgently learn that he should never, ever teach his kids to accept you as a \"complete replacement\". Obviously you're taking up their mother's role, and very well, too, as it seems. And that's beautiful. But you're taking up her role, not erasing her. You two - their deceased mom, and you as a step-mom - both need their place in their lives. Even if she has passed 10 years. Or 30. Trying to train them to call you \"mom\" is incredibly wrong and hurtful and erases their \"first\" mom. You are both moms to them - being a good step-mom is a very beautiful and valuable thing to be, there is no shame in this name, and you should be proud of it.\n\nYour inlaws are seriously overstepping and have similar grief issues as your husband, is my guess.\n\nSource: Have a friend whose mother passed when he was 3. His whole childhood, they made him call his adoptive mother - whom he loved! - his \"mom\". It caused deep hurt and confusion and now, at the ripe old age of 40, he has changed to calling her his adoptive mother, and his deceased bio-mother his mother. This deep emotional turmoil could have been prevented if BOTH mothers would have been allowed in his life - his deceased mother, and his adoptive.\n\nTLDR You're right. ALWAYS honour their mother and keep her present in their lives by respecting their wish to call you \"step-mother\" instead of \"mother\"! The people who want to erase those children's deceased mother need to get their ass into grief counseling and not waltz their unresolved issues onto the kids.", "NTA \n\nI'm sad that you are the only adult who honors your husband's late wife and how your stepchildren feel a out your place in their lives. I think time out was perfect for your son as he needs to stop that.", "Nta, I have step parents both ways and both are wonderful, but ice always called them by their name. They both know it's not to hurt them and they both know I think of them as parents. Your younger child was confused maybe I guess,idk, but you're fine", "Nta. I think maybe you should have a talk with your 6 year old and ask who gave him the idea they're being mean and he has to defend you. With your husband and in laws attitudes, i wouldn't be surprised if he got those ideas directly from them in which case they're using a 6 year old as their fall guy. Gross.", "NTA.  I\u2019m so glad your step kids have at least *one* adult in their corner. Thank you for helping preserve their moms memory. You\u2019re right. This cannot and should not be pushed.  She was their mother.  And the fact you respect that is huge and says so much about you.  I salute you for that.  Unfortunately, the behavior of your husband and the grandparents is\u2026 concerning.  Their attitude may well bomb the whole thing.  They could damage your relationship with your step kids even though you aren\u2019t the one being disrespectful of their moms memory.  Are your step kids in counseling?  Or have they been at any point?  Getting an outside perspective from a professional might get your husband to see how damaging that behavior is to his older kids.", "NTA. Youre bring a good parent.", "When I moved in with my step kids they asked what to call me and I told them whatever makes them comfortable.

You are explaining the situation to your son in an age appropriate way and doling out an age appropriate consequence. You\u2019re doing it right and your step kids will be grateful that you not only didn\u2019t push their boundaries, but respected them and helped enforce those boundaries. Your husband needs to let his go of his fantasy of all the kids calling you mom when they\u2019ve made it clear that\u2019s not on the table.", "Absolutely NTA.

Maybe 8 year old needs some grief counselling as well. \n\nPlease do talk to your husband about your feelings.

Has someone in the family been 'working' on him to cause trouble? I think you are right to insist that he stops this line of criticism of the step siblings but he obviously needs more chance to understand. Would he like it if someone else expected him to call her Mom? But maybe you shouldn't go there in case it causes anxiety!\n\nI wonder what your husband's problem is.

You\u2019re a good mom and stepmom.", "What a lovely human being you are, and **absolutely NTA.**\n\nAnd I'll tell you something, as someone who has worked with kids off and on for over 30 years, you're NTA for another reason entirely that I'm not sure either you OR your husband has considered: this isn't just about your relationship to his kids, it is, even at the young age of 6 (unfortunately, in the world we live in) about toxic masculinity/emotions and his right as a boy/man to define other people's feelings for them.\n\nThis may sound like an absolutely acrobatic stretch at first glance, and trust me, I get it!! But we live in a world where sayings like \"boys will be boys\" still exist, and little boys are taught to be confident and assertive in believing that what they feel and think is an objective truth rather than an opinion or a feeling . . . while little girls, even in this 21st century, are taught to smooth things over, acquiesce, calm situations down, make people feel safe, and that little boys who run roughshod over them are just doing it \"because they like you\".\n\nI'm sure that your little boy is a beautiful, loving, wonderful child. For real. I don't think he's naughty or bad or hateful IN ANY WAY. I think he believes that he is protecting his mummy and defending your honour, and doing it with his whole heart. But here's the important part: *you have told him that he is wrong about how you feel; that his siblings not calling you \"mommy\" DOES NOT HURT YOUR FEELINGS, that you still feel loved by them . . . and HE IS STILL INSISTENT THAT HIS OPINION ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS MATTERS MORE THAN WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD HIM YOU ACTUALLY FEEL, AND THAT IS A REALLY DANGEROUS PRECEDENT TO LET SLIDE.* Because you do not want to have your beautiful, thoughtful, defensive 6-year-old turn into the coercive 12-year-old or 16-year-old boy who tells the girl he likes, \"I know you said that you don't like me, but I see you behaving in a way that tells me otherwise.\" Or worse. \n\nBe gentle with him. Be kind. Be COMMUNICATIVE. Keep explaining, as many times as you need to, that Mummy's feelings are not hurt, that there are different kinds of love, and that all of them are wonderful.

He's been told that what he's saying is wrong several times. He's been told that he's not \"standing up for his mother\" or \"defending\" her. At this point, he's trying to force others to do what he wants *(Yes, a 6yo is perfectly capable of doing that)*. So it's time for him to be punished because what he's doing is wrong.", "Ridiculous. The 6 year old has had this fact explained to them, clearly many times. This is a standard and appropriate example of discipline.", "I never adopted them. I am not their mom. I am their stepmom. My nieces and nephew's call me by my name, friends kids call me by my name, being called by my name does not offend me.", "The calling a teacher by their name is a cultural thing. Where I live kids call their teachers by their name, or even nicknames. Nothing disrespectful about it.", "She didn\u2019t adopt them. She is their step-mother not their mother and her son is probably too young to fully understand why his step-siblings are calling her by her name. There is also no correlation between this story and calling your teacher by their first name. It\u2019s considered impolite to call your teacher by name because they are not your friend and they need to keep a certain boundary with their students. In this case, it would actually be disrespectful to the children\u2019s mom to force them to call her mom and OP is handling the situation very respectfully by honouring her step-children\u2019s wishes and their mother\u2019s memory.", "OP gets to decide what's respectful for her, not you.\n\nShe has said they call her by name, which she is fine with. That isn't disrespectful.", "She is nta and as she stated is not their mom... they have a mom...additionally if she is fine with them calling her by her first name it is NOT disrespectful... she has explained this to the child multiple times... he was wrong and 100% deserved her punishment.", "I don't agree... this has been this way his entire life so if someone wasn't behind the scenes putting ideas on his head I don't think he would have ever thought twice about it.", "He asked and it was explained to him, with pictures of the older kids mum too. OP even explained to 6 that it was hurt the older kids feeling for people to think that she was their mum. \n\nSo them trying to figure the situation out doesn't really cut, especially as they think the older kids are being mean, when there's no suggestion that they are. Imo, the only reason a 6yr old would think this was a mean situation was if someone told them it was.", "Yeah idk what OP meant but 6 is definitely old enough to understand that and more. He's just being stubborn at this point.", "Yes I know but I also don't believe in putting kids in time out for standing up for someone, she said her kid told her they dont like when their siblings are mean to mom which tells me that the 6 year old doesn't fully understand the situation and rather than putting a child in time out every time you need to talk to them so they understand rather than just punish them all the time. I have 3 kids and that's my opinion and how i would handle the situation", "The moment you married their dad you adopted them regardless of whether or not you signed an adoption sheet. You accepted responsibility for their lives. \n\nThen just tell your kids to call you by your name and have them stop calling you mom. Then the 6 yr old won\u2019t think they are being mean.", "Do they say Ms or Mr or just straight up first name? I\u2019ve traveled to many countries and attended school in several. I have never been to a place where a title was omitted and children were allowed to be that informal. \n\nThe US is actually one of the most informal countries, but titles are still used.", "It\u2019s funny how people brush off kids thinking they aren\u2019t smart enough to pick up on things. \n\nThe moment she chose a man with children she did in every sense adopt those kids. People are so incongruous. Step parent isn\u2019t the parent but better act like the parent in every way otherwise they are the evil step parent.", "Whatever, she\u2019s still the AH for punishing her son for his feelings while validating the stepchildren.", "She\u2019s the AH for invalidating her son\u2019s feelings and punishing him for them.", "I didn't adopt them when I married their dad. I became their stepmom. I signed up to marry a man with children but I knew going into it they did not want me to be their mom and I respect that.\n\nAdoption is legally binding. My relationship with my stepkids is not.", "No she didn't!", "My kids are at a bilingual school. They call their english teachers Miss first name, their regular teachers just by their first name. Even the principal, etc.\n\nAdults in general actually. Friends' parents, whatever. I work with kids (OT) and they also all call me by my 1st name or nickname. \n\nAlso I don't find the US informal, with the sirs and ma'ams that a lot of people use. I have even heard of kids being made to call their parents that!!!\n\nETA we live in South America, just for context.", "No she isn't the ah.... first this is between her and the stepkids and he was told multiple times... he was punished for pushing a situation that was already explained to him and being disrespectful as he souks have been.... great job as both a mom AND step mom", "Ah, I see. You don\u2019t actually view them as your kids. They were just extra baggage he had.", "Sorry, but a child is very perceptive and her son thinks they are being mean. He has probably observed more than just calling mom by her first name. There is more to this and punishing the kid is wrong.", "They are not baggage.\n\nThey are children. They are my husband's children with his late wife. They are children I love and help raise. They are children I would do anything for.\n\nI am not someone they chose or someone they asked for. So I am willing to be whatever I am needed to be and that is a stepmom who understands I will never be their mom and I can never claim them as mine in the way their dad can. I am the person who will always love them and help them honor their mom and enjoy the fact that they might not want me as a mom, but they love me as family. Just like I love them as family."]}
