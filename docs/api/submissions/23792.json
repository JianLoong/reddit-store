So then, how are you TA? NTA.", "A jack russel? Are you being serious right now? Not a mastiff or a rottweiler or some ungodly 200 pound slobbering hound that can kill you with a single bite? And do you mean Leila was acting like a DOG? The dog kids INSISTED on seeing? A Happy dog? Not a cruel, aggressive, violent dog that charged them the moment they stepped out of the car, but an lively dog, happy to see old friends?\n\nHell nawh. NTA!!\n\nI know tons of dogs, own three and it's one thing to have idiotic dogs who can bite and scratch, it's another to have overly excited doggos who are just really clumsy. I warn kids who try to pet my Malinois that she gets excited, though I do hold her by the collar whens he starts to jump (She can literally french-kiss your eyeball) . She is so happy to play with kids she literally pees herself with joy and rolls on her back, wanting tickles. \n\nYour gran is the AH, for arranging it so that she gets to play the hero and the f\\*\\*\\*\\* JACK RUSSEL gets to be the monster. What is wrong with that kid? Why is he so afraid? Or is that entirely grandma's doing, too?", "So grandma thought the best place to meet the dog was in a tiny, crowded bedroom.  JR/C sounds like a hyper little dog, especially when meeting new people, as you say.  \n\nNTA.  It would have been better to meet in a large living room our outside so the kid didn't have to get close if they didn't want to.", "Grandma is the AH, having engineered this whole thing. She lied about the kids'' interest in the dog and staged it in a crammed little place for utmost drama.\n\nIf you just leave grandma out of your comings and goings, everything would be fine. \n\nNTA, but you will be if you give grandma any more opportunities to make trouble.", "Train your dog to not jump at people\n\nYour dog isn't accountable, but you are", "INFO: Did you let them in or did they invite themselves in?", "NTA, your grandmother shouldn't have forced a kid who is afraid of dogs to go see laila. you tried to keep her in another room and held onto her while the kids were around her so she couldn't jump on them... what else did your grandmother expect you to do?", "Train your dog not to jump and give kisses when she meets people. That's not an okay behavior, doesn't matter if a person is scared of dogs ot not. Also, train your dog so she can stay at home alone if needed. I'd go YTA just because you didn't train your dog at all. Thebtest of story is irrelevant, coz the dog is not responsible for anything, it's a dog.

Next time H wants to \u201csee the dog\u201d decline unless he\u2019s gotten help for his phobia. You and the dog don\u2019t need to be blamed for \u201cscaring the kids\u201d.

Your grandma is stupid, and a dick. What did she expect??? Rude ass.", "NTA. You did everything right to make sure to account for your cousin\u2019s fear of dogs.
