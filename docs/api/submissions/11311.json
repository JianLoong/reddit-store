He's not! He's incredibly fortunate.", "Keep that money for yourself. Your (hopefully soon to be ex) bf seems like a dude who can never be satisfied.

It's not okay for your boyfriend to treat you like that regardless if they're upset or angry. You don't need to be like anyone on a Twitter feed. You are enough.

Spending the amount of money you did on him is enough and the fact that you are trying to make more money to meet his lifestyle needs is very telling.

He\u2019s disappointed he didn\u2019t get what he wanted \u2014 that\u2019s an emotion. Or he\u2019s angry he didn\u2019t get all his gifts (gifts he could easily buy for himself and did not give you enough time to budget for). Which is more concerning, that a grown man is angry about specific gifts when he did receive good gifts. \n\nA good bf would be able to acknowledge his own emotions and respect and acknowledge yours too. Instead of pretending to be superior because he\u2019s a being of pure logic. He\u2019s not, he\u2019s either lying to you or lying to himself. No human being has zero emotions, and it\u2019s silly to pretend that\u2019s the case. A good partner cares about the other persons feelings, and would respect  and appreciate your efforts, instead of treating you like Santa and feeling entitled to every gift on his wish list. He knows you aren\u2019t magic and have limited money, so there is no excuse for him to act this way. \n\nMore concerning tho: If he doesn\u2019t laugh at his brother for listening to Andrew tate, or plan an intervention for his bro, that is a huge red flag and you should absolutely immediately dump him. You are NTA. He and his brother are TA", "NTA\n\nOh lordy, pls don\u2019t fall for that \u2018man so rational vs hysterical woman and her wandering womb\u2019 twaddle. \n\nAlso, total bullshit, since he clearly allows himself to have all the emotional reactions he wants, at whatever decibel level he chooses, since he threw a whiplash tantrum immediately post your tying yourself into lacy knots to please him, essentially impoverishing yourself in the process, only to get a nasty little ambush about five minutes later. Nasty is the word too, really really nasty. \n\nThis is not a good guy, don\u2019t let him gaslight you. Your emotions don\u2019t overwhelm him at all, they simply inconvenience him, and he\u2019d prefer not to deal with them while keeping you dancing merrily on a string. Stop dancing, please, just stop.", "So he gets to be emotional and illogical (saying you didn't do anything for him when you objectively did), but you don't?", "Maybe his brother got ahold of his phone and wrote those texts. If the brother didn't, then you really need to rethink your relationship because you are likely getting yourself into another abusive relationship.", "Bro wtf lol. Dump him. Just based on that he sounds like a disrespectful and misogynistic  \u201calpha\u201d male. Being kind to you but then turning into a dick the second his brother opens his mouth means he\u2019s not actually kind to you.\n\nHe\u2019s gonna be 30 in a year and he\u2019s tweeting about not getting p*say to focus on money? The reg flags are insane. Please leave him!", "I\u2019m going to tell him everything I did once we talk again. Maybe he just thinks my gestures were easy and not intentional.", "OMG. So, he views women as sexual objects? Do you really want to have to fight to establish yourself as human enough to deserve basic respect?\n\nIf that's what he's posting in public, he's definitely called us cum dumpsters or worse to his bros.", "Sorry I missed the first part of your response. He gets me gifts & takes me out for food which is why I was like, okay one credit card charge wouldn\u2019t hurt in comparison.", "Ugh yeah, reading these responses I\u2019m actually starting to see how silly I probably sound. I\u2019m really not exaggerating when I say when it\u2019s just him and I he is very lovable and respectful. Which is why it\u2019s so confusing when he defaults to the He Man Woman Hater Club kind of thinking when he\u2019s upset. Like I know that\u2019s not him and he\u2019s so much better than that. I really think it\u2019s because of culture and what he saw growing up.", "I\u2019m going to say this as many times as I have to. \n\nSomeone who is only lovable with you alone is not lovable at all. He is showing you who he is. This IS him.", "NTA. But this man does not care about you. Reading your comments- you deserve better. You are selling yourself super short. Someone who is only nice to you when other people aren\u2019t around isn\u2019t love. He also sounds like he views women as sex objects and his brother sounds repulsive. Gather your beautiful self, and LEAVE THIS MAN.", "Buy him a red flag for his birthday. Oh wait, he already has a bunch of those. \n\nNTA and he's being incredibly disrespectful and manipulative. DTMFA and find someone who'll actually appreciate what a generous and thoughtful partner you are.", "NTA\n\nI saw one of your comments OP that his brother is an Andrew Tate fan and this sounds like the kind of BS those types of men pull, because either he is trying to gaslight you in the most real way or he had an ischemic attack and is suffering memory loss concerning all you did for his birthday. I think the former is more likely.", "NTA\n\nThis reminds me of those incredibly spoiled teenagers who throw actual temper tantrums because the new BMW their parents got them for their birthday is the wrong color.\n\nSo. Do you want to be linked to a stupid, spoiled teenager in the body of a 29-year-old man?  I think you know the answer to that.", "NTA, your boyfriend sucks time to move on\n\nedit: just read he's being influenced by Andrew tate, run away as fast as you can", "NTA\n\nGuess he has a severe case of amnesia \n\nMaybe you\u2019ll come down with one too and forget you even had a boyfriend \n\nBut in all seriousness time to get off the text messages and have a face to face about this BS. And no\u2014stress does not count for jack\n\nPeople who say don\u2019t do anything for XYZ day or holiday don\u2019t get be upset when people listen. If he wanted something he should have said so\n\nAlso sounds like his birthday is close to Valentine\u2019s Day\u2014so maybe he\u2019s getting confused about which gifts were for which? But he just honestly sounds like delusional AH", "NTA, but he certainly is. If it was me (but I am the queen of petty), I'd write up a bill of everything I spent and hand it to him (including how much it would cost to have some gorgeous babe parade around all day in lingerie), saying that if you didn't buy him anything, then he owes you this much that you spent.\n\nAnd then, I must echo everyone else and tell you that he doesn't deserve you. You can do better. SO much better.", "Please dump him. He sounds super ungrateful, greedy and immature. You deserve better. Also, watch your budget and do not charge things you can not afford especially for this wingnut.", "NTA - he asked for two things last minute that he could afford to buy himself, all while knowing your financial circumstances.\n\nInstead you plan a much more considerate massage gift, and more, and he acts like a spolit child - definitely doesn't deserve you.", "NTA - he asked for two things last minute that he could afford to buy himself, all while knowing your financial circumstances.\n\nInstead you plan a much more considerate massage gift, and more, and he acts like a spolit child - definitely doesn't deserve you.\n\nDon't keep trying to please someone who isn't worth it.", "Just going to say YTA if you do *this*. Have some respect for yourself and put yourself first.", "He\u2019s not a child/much less your child, and you\u2019re not Santa Claus. You\u2019re not supposed to be \u201csplurging\u201d on him when he doesn\u2019t even return 1/100th of the effort. Please love YOURSELF better. I know it seems to you that \u201che only get like this when he\u2019s upset,\u201d but that means he\u2019s immature and in no position ready to be in an adult relationship. Splurging and literally bending over backwards for someone 24/7 are very different. As I say, please love yourself better\u2764\ufe0f", "This sounds like a lot of code for \"I don't want to deal with your feelings and I won't.\" Is that really what you want from your partner?", "AKA \"He's a wonderful person most of the time, except when he's (insert abusive behaviour here)\"", ">Like I know that\u2019s not him and he\u2019s so much better than that.\n\nIt is him. Its part of him. We all have good parts and bad parts. Not to mention, his culture and what he saw growing up are likely the most important factors he has in forming who he is today; your influence cannot compete with those things. If you were just competing with the influence of social media or some passing fad, maybe you'd stand a chance - but his culture and family? That *is* him.\n\nI get you don't want to automatically end things based on internet comments, but hear this: you go to him, you say your piece - if you get anything less than a full and sincere apology would *that* be enough for you to quit him? You don't have to break up now, but please have the strength in you to do so and be prepared.", "He does not sound loveable OR respectful from what you're describing, hon. You don't sound silly. He sounds like a selfish, sexist boor."]}
