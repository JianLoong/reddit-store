I feel terrible about this, but I also sort of stand by what I said. \n\nMy wife (34F) and I (32M) have been happily married for 8 years. We have two kids, 6 and 4. Until recently, we've been able to effectively divide our household chores and parenting duties equally. \n\nAbout 6 months ago, my wife's tiktok and instagram algorithms started showing her content that's primarily been involving criticism of men, particularly in terms of their contributions to marriages, parenting, and chores. I'm all for constructive discussions about gender roles and stuff like that, but the content I've seen from her account take it to an extreme, stereotyping all men as lazy, and neglectful. \n\nIn the past few weeks, my wife began posting her own content about our personal life, portraying me as a negligent and uncaring husband and father who doesn't pull his weight around the house. I was really hurt when I saw these posts on our account, particularly because she has close friends, and family members on both sides who follow her account and are reaching out to me asking me if everything is okay in our marriage now that she's posting her own content, and not just reposting other videos she finds. Not only was her content way inaccurate, but I feel uncomfortable opening up these elements of my personal life to all of our friends and family, let alone strangers who have found themselves engaging as well. \n\nI attempted to discuss this with her. She shrugged it off, and accused me of being insensitive to the struggles with women, and not understanding her need for an outlet to vent. \n\nI completely lost my patience in front of the kids. I told her she was being a fucking keyboard warrior more interested in getting clout from toxic women online than the reality of our life. I also told her she was being an ungrateful dickhead and spreading lies about me and our marriage. \n\nAs soon as I called her a dickhead and seeing her reaction to what I was saying, as well as hearing my daughter starting to cry, I regretted it. She looked more sad than angry with what I was saying, and she just sort of shut down and hasn't spoken to me since, outside of very minimal conversations about breakfast or plans for the kids. \n\nI feel like I have a right to be upset about what she's saying on social media, but I think I took it way too far. I really don't know how to approach the rest of the discussion we obviously need to have.", "created_utc": 1690213361, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/158e8cl/aita_for_losing_my_patience_and_saying_hurtful/", "score": 171, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Instead of showing her that her assumptions about you being nonreceptive to that discussion were wrong, you validated them by blowing up in her face and insulting her.\n\nIt sounds like you need to do a lot of groveling and apologizing for being so insulting to her. Then you need to figure out what has broken your lines of communication down so badly in your relationship that she goes to the internet rather than speaking about those issues with you.\n\nThe way you're talking about how this made you feel without thinking once about how she feels in anything but extremely uncomplimentary words shows that you probably are not capable of having a productive conversation by yourself without it turning into a fight and making her apologize to you for your own hurt feelings.

I know my wife picks up my slack a lot and gives more reminders that she should have to, so I work extra hard every day to make sure I'm doing as close as 50% as I can and picking up slack elsewhere (I'm the breadwinner and I often bring her treats or just do certain tasks I know she dreads and we usually do together before she even sees the mess).

And that's not tackling who has the mental load for planning all of that.\n\nStill, I don't think a nitpick of adding up columns is going to help him much.

Once he figures it out, he can address the hurt feelings -- both hers and his.", "In his follow-ups he is beginning to be more empathetic, so I think that's good.

This could be the difference in perception. It\u2019s also possible that she stressing over the finances (needlessly or not) so is putting more mental energy towards them than might otherwise be the case.\n\nThe final thing - and there\u2019s not too much they can do about this - is who do the kids prefer to go to for problems. My kids have an annoying tendency to choose me over their dad. They need something in the kitchen, they ask me. They want to talk, they come to me. The baby flat out refuses to be held by her dad if she knows I\u2019m around. It\u2019s exhausting, and there\u2019s very little either of us can do about it. \n\nThat part is the emotional labour, but ultimately the ability to divide that isn\u2019t truly in the parents\u2019 control.

She's going elsewhere to vent, which suggests they did not set up a good place for mutual discussion ahead of time or it went poorly last time they tried. Or it could just be toxic upbringings. My wife's was less than ideal so she has a tendency to bottle it up until she explodes. It just means I have to be a bit more attentive to her stress levels and coax out why she's feeling negative.

This type of behavior would be an almost automatic deal breaker for me and I'd assume many other people.

If she believes what she's saying on social media, and I believe what I'm saying on social media, then I'm doing the same exact thing, and didn't even realize this. I'm really disappointed at how far this has gotten. This has been by far the worst fight we've ever had.\n\nThis is a great realization and I hope it carries forward. Communication issues are usually not anyone really being wrong, it's just a lot of stuff spiraling out of control because everyone is making assumptions that the other person is being more malicious or careless than they actually are or are intending to be.\n\nIf this is your worst fight, I'd say it's not really that bad. But you should try to cut through the red tape of hurt by first apologizing for the remarks and then putting forth a neutral space to discuss her grievances. Realizing up front that she's probably going to be mad is good, because you did insult her to her face. If you can put aside the hurt and anger and try to really coax her to disclose concrete issues like \"when X happens it makes me unhappy so I would like Y to happen instead\" then you can have way more productive conversations than exchanging insults.\n\nReally keep it up with the empathy. I think your breakthrough here that you both believe what you say is a great one. You just need to get past the impulse to convince her that her feelings are wrong and aim towards uncovering where they come from. I think if that happens, it will give you space to also discuss your feelings about the disappointment that she was airing dirty laundry on social media.

Maybe it's time for a bigger conversation as to whether you should be together if she is so unhappy with you.
