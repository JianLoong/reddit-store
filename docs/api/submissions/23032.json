I feel terrible about this, but I also sort of stand by what I said. \n\nMy wife (34F) and I (32M) have been happily married for 8 years. We have two kids, 6 and 4. Until recently, we've been able to effectively divide our household chores and parenting duties equally. \n\nAbout 6 months ago, my wife's tiktok and instagram algorithms started showing her content that's primarily been involving criticism of men, particularly in terms of their contributions to marriages, parenting, and chores. I'm all for constructive discussions about gender roles and stuff like that, but the content I've seen from her account take it to an extreme, stereotyping all men as lazy, and neglectful. \n\nIn the past few weeks, my wife began posting her own content about our personal life, portraying me as a negligent and uncaring husband and father who doesn't pull his weight around the house. I was really hurt when I saw these posts on our account, particularly because she has close friends, and family members on both sides who follow her account and are reaching out to me asking me if everything is okay in our marriage now that she's posting her own content, and not just reposting other videos she finds. Not only was her content way inaccurate, but I feel uncomfortable opening up these elements of my personal life to all of our friends and family, let alone strangers who have found themselves engaging as well. \n\nI attempted to discuss this with her. She shrugged it off, and accused me of being insensitive to the struggles with women, and not understanding her need for an outlet to vent. \n\nI completely lost my patience in front of the kids. I told her she was being a fucking keyboard warrior more interested in getting clout from toxic women online than the reality of our life. I also told her she was being an ungrateful dickhead and spreading lies about me and our marriage. \n\nAs soon as I called her a dickhead and seeing her reaction to what I was saying, as well as hearing my daughter starting to cry, I regretted it. She looked more sad than angry with what I was saying, and she just sort of shut down and hasn't spoken to me since, outside of very minimal conversations about breakfast or plans for the kids. \n\nI feel like I have a right to be upset about what she's saying on social media, but I think I took it way too far. I really don't know how to approach the rest of the discussion we obviously need to have.", "created_utc": 1690213361, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/158e8cl/aita_for_losing_my_patience_and_saying_hurtful/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And the fact that your wife wasn\u2019t angry in response but just sad begs the question of how often you loose your temper or belittle your wife/daughter. \n\nI know a few women who didn\u2019t realize how unequal the divide between them and their husband/boyfriend was until they started seeing content online about loving, upstanding partnerships. They started asking if everyone had partners who could make their own dinner/clean their own clothes/didn\u2019t yell at them for not keeping a perfect house/etc. I\u2019m sure their husbands/boyfriends blamed the internet and a \u201ctoxic\u201d criticism of men when in reality they were being shitty partners and the women were just finally waking up to that fact. \n\nI genuinely can\u2019t tell if you are being a shitty partner and don\u2019t realize it or if your wife has fallen down a rabbit hole on TikTok and is trying to impress her followers.

Couples therapy may be helpful if these conversations aren\u2019t productive. \n\nIf she\u2019s really and truly sharing lies, that sucks.

Instead of showing her that her assumptions about you being nonreceptive to that discussion were wrong, you validated them by blowing up in her face and insulting her.\n\nIt sounds like you need to do a lot of groveling and apologizing for being so insulting to her. Then you need to figure out what has broken your lines of communication down so badly in your relationship that she goes to the internet rather than speaking about those issues with you.\n\nThe way you're talking about how this made you feel without thinking once about how she feels in anything but extremely uncomplimentary words shows that you probably are not capable of having a productive conversation by yourself without it turning into a fight and making her apologize to you for your own hurt feelings.

I would suggest couples therapy.", "YTA for losing your shit in front of your kids.

Something is not right in their relationship and they have communication issues. That's not unilateral.

You\u2019ve both turned to social media to vent about the other. This is based on the assumption that she truly believes what she\u2019s saying and not that she\u2019s just acting maliciously. And again, I think therapy is needed and a deep dive into her social media and what\u2019s triggering this. \n\nGood luck.", "Ah, okay. \n\nDoctor's appointments are primarily handled by her. Since I cook, I take primary care of the kitchen, including grocery shopping and keeping a running inventory of what we have. This includes for the kids lunches, which she packs. \n\nWe don't really have a concrete \"schedule\" of those kinds of activities. We both sorta make arrangements as we get events. \n\nI agree with you about taking to social media for our problems. If she believes what she's saying on social media, and I believe what I'm saying on social media, then I'm doing the same exact thing, and didn't even realize this. I'm really disappointed at how far this has gotten. This has been by far the worst fight we've ever had."]}
