I feel terrible about this, but I also sort of stand by what I said. \n\nMy wife (34F) and I (32M) have been happily married for 8 years. We have two kids, 6 and 4. Until recently, we've been able to effectively divide our household chores and parenting duties equally. \n\nAbout 6 months ago, my wife's tiktok and instagram algorithms started showing her content that's primarily been involving criticism of men, particularly in terms of their contributions to marriages, parenting, and chores. I'm all for constructive discussions about gender roles and stuff like that, but the content I've seen from her account take it to an extreme, stereotyping all men as lazy, and neglectful. \n\nIn the past few weeks, my wife began posting her own content about our personal life, portraying me as a negligent and uncaring husband and father who doesn't pull his weight around the house. I was really hurt when I saw these posts on our account, particularly because she has close friends, and family members on both sides who follow her account and are reaching out to me asking me if everything is okay in our marriage now that she's posting her own content, and not just reposting other videos she finds. Not only was her content way inaccurate, but I feel uncomfortable opening up these elements of my personal life to all of our friends and family, let alone strangers who have found themselves engaging as well. \n\nI attempted to discuss this with her. She shrugged it off, and accused me of being insensitive to the struggles with women, and not understanding her need for an outlet to vent. \n\nI completely lost my patience in front of the kids. I told her she was being a fucking keyboard warrior more interested in getting clout from toxic women online than the reality of our life. I also told her she was being an ungrateful dickhead and spreading lies about me and our marriage. \n\nAs soon as I called her a dickhead and seeing her reaction to what I was saying, as well as hearing my daughter starting to cry, I regretted it. She looked more sad than angry with what I was saying, and she just sort of shut down and hasn't spoken to me since, outside of very minimal conversations about breakfast or plans for the kids. \n\nI feel like I have a right to be upset about what she's saying on social media, but I think I took it way too far. I really don't know how to approach the rest of the discussion we obviously need to have.", "created_utc": 1690213361, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/158e8cl/aita_for_losing_my_patience_and_saying_hurtful/", "score": 1238, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Couples therapy may be helpful if these conversations aren\u2019t productive. \n\nIf she\u2019s really and truly sharing lies, that sucks.

Instead of showing her that her assumptions about you being nonreceptive to that discussion were wrong, you validated them by blowing up in her face and insulting her.\n\nIt sounds like you need to do a lot of groveling and apologizing for being so insulting to her. Then you need to figure out what has broken your lines of communication down so badly in your relationship that she goes to the internet rather than speaking about those issues with you.\n\nThe way you're talking about how this made you feel without thinking once about how she feels in anything but extremely uncomplimentary words shows that you probably are not capable of having a productive conversation by yourself without it turning into a fight and making her apologize to you for your own hurt feelings. You need to figure out how to be more interested in your wife's feelings and less obsessed with your own pride.\n\nThis is salvageable, but will probably take a skilled mediator. I would suggest couples therapy.", "YTA for losing your shit in front of your kids.

It\u2019s also possible that she stressing over the finances (needlessly or not) so is putting more mental energy towards them than might otherwise be the case.\n\nThe final thing - and there\u2019s not too much they can do about this - is who do the kids prefer to go to for problems. My kids have an annoying tendency to choose me over their dad. They need something in the kitchen, they ask me. They want to talk, they come to me.

But you should try to cut through the red tape of hurt by first apologizing for the remarks and then putting forth a neutral space to discuss her grievances.

I think your breakthrough here that you both believe what you say is a great one. You just need to get past the impulse to convince her that her feelings are wrong and aim towards uncovering where they come from.

I\u2019ve read your comments and the split seems fair. At least fair enough that she should\u2019ve felt comfortable to discuss a change when she needed one.\n\nMy suggestion is based on my experience.\n\nI have a really good husband. We mostly agree on things, but sometimes I feel we don\u2019t agree on political views that I find important but overall are not a big deal. And even then our views are quite close.\n\nFor example, abortion, my husband is pro choice for the most part. But he did not agree that the abortion changes that recently happened could put women\u2019s lives in danger. He believed that they would still perform medically necessary abortions etc etc. ultimately I left it alone. I figured it was a discussion for a later time because he was looking at it legally and he frankly was not and would likely never be in a position to understand what happens to the outliers.\n\nSo anyways, at the time I had started watching the handmaidens tale, and while not \u201creal\u201d it made me FUCKING MAD. It made me mad that there were parallels in it to be made within our society. It made me MAD that I could CONNECT with these women\u2019s emotions and experience despite this being such an extreme version. I was angry the more I watched. And then my husband would come home, and sometimes I would discuss the show and he would argue against something or disagree that our society treated women \u201cthis way\u201d and that made me angry at him for not understanding \u201cus\u201d, or that I felt he didn\u2019t want to listen to my rants about how the show made me feel or how I felt women were not valued or treated appropriately and that really pissed me off. I wanted him to listen to me connect to this show and how women felt or could be placed in society as it was, or especially if circumstances were different. But he really couldn\u2019t place himself in mine or their shoes, and it wasn\u2019t really fair for me to attack him the moment he came home to me with my feelings from it.\n\nUltimately I kind of had to stop watching it. It\u2019s a good show, and I think the point is ultimately important and there, but frankly it just made me so angry and it made me far angrier at my husband for things that honestly weren\u2019t real issues for us. I supposed they could be down the road, but realistically he\u2019s a good guy with an open mind, if we encounter those issues I\u2019m pretty confident we can talk them out and reach a happy conclusion. I\u2019m very confident that were I ever in a position of the kind that the show made me worried over, \n that he would absolutely have supported me.\n\nThe point is, that m show made me so angry at men as a whole. And my husband was not one of those men.\n\nI think those tiktok videos do the same. Women are there pouring their hearts out over bad men. And men, especially a man who is not them, will want to defend themselves. And we don\u2019t rest want to hear it because we\u2019re trying to be heard for ourselves and for our peers.\n\nThat\u2019s why I think these sort of things can be unhealthy.  It riles everyone up to a point beyond what they may be actually experiencing. Imagine if a man was seeing all these TikTok\u2019s about women who abuse men for financial gain constantly and then they come home after work with a SAHM and they start connecting to it thinking well shouldn\u2019t she be doing this?\n\nOr worse they see fake TikTok\u2019s with SAHM who bend over backwards for their husbands despite themselves going \u201cthis is what a good wife does\u201d. It\u2019s a confusing message that implies any woman who is not doing that, is simply not working hard enough.\n\nThank you all for attending my Ted talk.

In my case I think she went too far down the tiktok rabbit hole as well. She began calling me a covert narcissist, that I was engaging in malicious compliance, and weaponized incompetence. I don't think any of those things are true.  However there were major issues with my behaviour. I was depressed, and our relationship issues and her reaction to them made me more depressed. As I got more depressed I retreated from the marriage, from being a father, and I did less and less around the house. I definitely was leaving the mental burden almost entirely to her.
