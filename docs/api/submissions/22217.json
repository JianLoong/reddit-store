{"id": 22217, "submission_id": "14zh609", "title": "AITA for not wanting to go to dinner with my girlfriend's cousin and friends when I'm sick with a fluctuating fever?", "selftext": "I (30M) have been dealing with some gastrointestinal problems since November of 2022 that have been coming and going. I got a major case of the stomach flu or food poisoning back in mid-April that took me out of work for NINE shifts in a row, and I had probably only ever called out of work five total times in my life prior to that. Since that stomach flu, I've been experiencing digestive issues that have caused extreme abdominal discomfort from gas (to the point that the stabbing pain made it impossible to walk) on and off.\n\nMy girlfriend (23F) has seemingly been frustrated and annoyed by the whole situation (as am I) and seems to think I'm a bit of a hypochondriac. Prior to this year, I never used to get sick, this is relatively new to me and I've yet to figure out the reasoning. We attended a concert for her birthday on Monday evening, and I woke up the next day exhausted (we were general admission and were on our feet for almost nine hours) and developed a minor fever. Yesterday and the day before, I had body aches, chills, fatigue, and my fever was been fluctuating between 100-102.5 with little to no appetite and nausea.\n\nYesterday morning, she asked if I wanted to grab dinner with her at her favorite restaurant (one I really don't care for but go to for her) and then go home and watch a movie at night. I wasn't thrilled about the idea of going out for dinner, but I felt like I could handle a quick dinner because my fever appeared to be dropping and was on the lower end. She then texted me right before she got home saying she invited her cousin and his friends to dinner with us because they were in town for a couple of days and she wanted to see them.\n\nAt that point, I was frustrated because I felt like she wasn't taking my feelings and the fact that I was sick into consideration. I hadn't met the cousin or friends before, so dinner was going to require much more energy and social capital than I had originally agreed to. I told her I wasn't thrilled about the idea of going out with the group, and that I wish she had asked me before inviting them along. She then started responding with comments about not being able to see her family, and I encouraged her to go by herself with them and I would stay home (I literally had zero interest in going out in the first place and only agreed for her sake). She got stubborn and refused to go, and I felt like she was being inconsiderate and not taking me being sick seriously. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to add that I am definitely still working full time, going to work even when I'm feeling under the weather on a number of occasions. Additionally, I visited an urgent care during the initial stomach flu back in April and they just sent me back home and told me to ride it out. I plan on seeing a GI specialist, but financial reasons have made it more difficult to start going down that path.

You need to see a doctor.   I guess the pandemic didnt teach your girlfriend anything?  As the cousins I wouldn't go over, I don't know if you are contagious!", "You\u2019re NTA but\u2026you are responsible for seeking out a diagnosis of, and treatment for, your chronic illness which you have allowed to drag on for a very long time. She has a right to be frustrated.", "NTA\n\nBut I see no talk here of going to see a doctor or specialist. You need to get yourself checked out. If you aren't going to see their friends or working. Drag your ass down to the doctors. You cannot allow this ailment to control your life.\n\nIf you think your partner is mad now just wait for another couple weeks with no real solution being sought out.", "NTA because you were sick. The stomach bug may have thrown off your normal gut bacteria or something bigger may be going on. You need to see a GI specialist.", "I think the fever is affecting your brain because you are absolutely NTA.\n\nYour girlfriend, on the other hand, is such a massive AH that it\u2019s making *me* nauseous. She\u2019s the real disease here. Who the hell asks anyone to go anywhere with a 100+ temp? A decent person would tell you to stay the fuck home and then bring you soup home from the restaurant.", "She is being incredibly immature and selfish about this. You're SICK. \nIf my husband was acting like this I'd be baying him at home in bed I wouldn't even mention the idea of takeout. \n\nFocus on healing yourself.", "Nta, stay at home, get healthy.", "NTA. Who asks someone to go anywhere when they're sick. Seriously, wtf.", "NTA, and I'm so sorry you're dealing with this.\n\nAs someone who has been chronically ill for over 30 years, I was almost tempted to say N-A-H only because my experience has been that because of the way human bodies work (programmed to forget what it REALLY feels like to be very ill or in pain other than in vague generalities, because otherwise no one would ever do things like have babies because the memory of the pain would be so traumatic), even those who genuinely love us and mean well tend to have trouble empathising beyond a certain point, and forget just how genuinely awful it feels to be sick not just for a few days but over a long period . . . that you don't somehow \"get used to it\" but just continue to feel equally crappy (and exhausted from days and weeks of sickness) the whole time. They lose patience because they GENUINELY don't remember just how bad it feels . . .until the next time they're sick. \n\nFor example, because of my illness I tend to run a lot of low-grade fevers, and I've watched people suggest after a couple of weeks of my having fever that \"perhaps I should just push myself to go out and do things anyway\", not because they're trying to be hateful but because some part of them really doesn't understand that the 15th day of fever doesn't feel better than the first, it feels WORSE because you've been sick for weeks. And that just like they wouldn't want to go run errands or go out for brunch (and yes, too have been pushed to do that) when they're running a fever, neither would I. Not even several weeks in.\n\nBUT . . .\n\nYou're NTA and she is an AH because this isn't just about her struggling to understand how you're feeling, it's about her suggesting that you're exaggerating or making excuses. She is prioritising her own frustration but it hasn't even occurred to her how frustrating it must be for YOU to not only feel so ill all the time but have to put your life on hold. You're not doing this on purpose, you're suffering.  And her approach to all this just makes it more hurtful.  I'm really sorry. You deserve better.", "NTA. You should not be going anywhere if you have a fever. Do not be spreading that around!", "NTA. All aside, why people (like your GF) think it's ok for others to hang out with someone sick. If I was anyone in the group of the cousin I would be mad to know someone feverish joined us.", "NTA.

I don't why commenters are mentioning you needing to see a specialist (but it's good that you've added an edit) when your gf didn't mention that in her complaints at all. Even if she had, the core question of 'AITA for staying home when I am sick and could possibly be contagious' is NTA without question.", "NAH\n\nShe can be frustrated.  You can be frustrated. \n\nYou need to be actively searching for medical solutions.  \n\nAnd you need to be clear - you are either physically too sick to go to dinner or you aren't.  Adding additional people in the mix makes it more of a social concern, which is different from a physical medical issue.  Not saying that isn't valid but be clear when you communicate to your partner.", "ESH. And I say this with great empathy, as I am someone who has wrestled with a chronic stomach issue for over 7 years. You have to try everything to see what's going on with you, talk to western doctors and get treatments done, talk to nutritionists, go to acupuncture, have your damn aura read... chronic issues like these don't just go away and it will cost money and time to fix but you don't want to live like this. I have some of your same symptoms and would be happy to share some of the things that helped me, #1 was going to a therapist to develop a game plan. This is why I say ESH, you need to get help and if a GI specialist costs too much there are other (free) routes. \n\nYour GF needs to understand she's living with someone with a chronic illness and if she can't handle that, you two need to talk that through.", "NGL, when I first read the headline, I thought it said \"flatuating fever\", and wondered what in the world that was.", "NTA - just food for thoughts - I had similar symptoms a while ago and it turned out to be some weird lactose intolerance, that went away after 6 months all by itself. Maybe try cutting back dairy until you manage to see the specialist?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are expecting a much younger person to be mature. 23 is to old to be this immature, however, there will always we areas you are ahead and where you are behind as a person.

Beside a that, if you want to know what OTC stuff has helped me with similar issues, I can share.", "NTA.  Unfortunately as someone who has a spouse who is a bit younger, we had to deal with the differences in maturity levels over those early years.  You wouldn't think that 7 years is that different, but in this day and age, it really is.  A lot of life experience happens in those years between early 20s and early 30s.  I think you're really going to have to sit her down and talk to her about expectations when you're sick!  You are being a bit of an AH to yourself by not seeing a doctor.  I know money can be tight, but you have no idea what's going on in your body.  Plus it could just be a matter of needing a med for GERD or something that could be easily managed over the counter.  Definitely get yourself checked out!", "You\u2019re NTA at all. Your gf is being incredibly inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, you might have to get those issues checked out. IBS, Crohn\u2019s disease, maybe even an ulcer that would require surgery. Digestive issues suck (IBS sufferer here), and I\u2019d definitely recommend ruling out everything.", "NTA.  Does your gf have no compassion?  Wtf is wrong with her?  You're right, having more people there does require more energy & effort.  When you're under the weather you just don't have the energy to entertain others.  If your gf wants to go she can go alone.  She s/b staying home & taking care of you.", "NTA. GF need to grow up. You have a fever over 100. You need to see a doctor (not ER, but\u2026) and take care of your health. Maybe a healthier relationship as well.", "While you are waiting to go see a GI specialist (which you need, buddy, so bad. And I say that as someone who lives with chronic debilitating pain myself), look into an elimination diet. It\u2019s the sort of thing where you eat a very limited diet to see if that relieves any of the issues and slowly add ingredients in to see if a flare up happens. Research FODMAPs too, because they irritate IBS, and may cause issues for whatever you\u2019re dealing with. Minimize gas producing foods and beverages- no carbonation, minimal fiber, and so on. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA here at all. You\u2019re low on [spoons](https://www.goodrx.com/health-topic/mental-health/spoon-theory#) and you need to conserve them. For people who are healthy, socializing doesn\u2019t always feel like it takes energy, but when you\u2019re chronically ill or even just regular ill? Hell yeah! \n\nAnd in the possible but highly unlikely event this is contagious (like C. Diff or anything else similar), then you shouldn\u2019t do this! Hell, you probably shouldn\u2019t be going to work if you can avoid it!", "NTA. You gut bugs got mixed up and you are obviously out of balance. There are some really odd bugs out there that will mess you up like this.\n\nBecause this is Reddit, I have to point out the age difference. She has a lot more energy. If you are having health issues, she needs to be understanding of that. You may need a more mature, empathetic partner.", "NTA, also I was highly nightshade intolerant for about 3 years after a nasty stomach flu, had pretty much all of the same symptoms you posted. It took about a full year of that to figure out the cause of the issue because it seemed so random. Turned out to be tomatoes, potatoes, and onions that were the primary trigger for me. (This did not stop me from eating them lol) Then one day it cleared up just as quickly as it appeared. Bodies are weird and getting into a GI Dr is definitely a good idea!", "I would also recommend that you try to minimize eating inflammatory foods, that could be making your issues worse honestly.  For now, a liquid and/or BRAT diet is going to be your best bet until whatever this illness is passes but after that, try to keep things to foods that are easier on your body to digest.  \n\nFor the liquid diet - broth and jello are the big ones but you should be able to search for other ideas easily.  Just look up the diet list for a colonoscopy.  Once your stomach is a bit more settled, you can add in the BRAT diet which stands for bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. \n\nI\u2019d also add that Celiac could be a possibility as well, before I got diagnosed, I would get severe stomach pain after eating to the point that I would be curled up in the fetal position after trying to eat anything.  If getting in to a GI is difficult, you can try an elimination diet for now to see if your body responds better to cutting out gluten from your diet.  Usually about 3 weeks is good to see if you start feeling a bit better and then you re-introduce it back into your diet.  If you start getting sick again, then you have your answer, it was the gluten.  You can also try this with other foods too, I\u2019ve had to do it for fructose and dairy as well.  Between those two and gluten, those are the big offenders for GI issues.", "This is super hard to do.

And the damage from my gallbladder being bad so long and making me so sick is still lingering today.\n\nI had 3 er Dr's tell me I just needed to not smoke weed. When that was literally my only pain management, since I couldn't keep medicine down long enough to work.\n\nHealthcare is still in the dark ages.", "If someone can't afford it though, they can't afford it. Dr's require copays up front. So do imaging centers.", "OP stated he plans to see a specialist but can\u2019t afford it right now. That\u2019s not his fault, it\u2019s the health care system in his country\u2019s fault."]}
