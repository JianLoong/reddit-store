My friends are all in their 30s cause I met them through my husband 32M. \n\nOne of my friends threw a little cookout/get together a week ago to celebrate the weather finally warming up for good. It was a very nice party, just around 10 of us. \n\nOne of the guys there brought his new girlfriend. She seemed like a sweet girl at first, so I didn't pay much attention. She was quiet and clung to her boyfriend and kinda killed the mood though. \n\nAs it got later, she started to change though. She seemed restless, sad, and pouty. Everyone fawned over her. She sat down in a corner to sulk. \n\nAnd then she started crying. It was like watching a train wreck in slow motion. She was fine one minute and absolutely sobbing the next. Crying in a corner for no damn reason. \n\nHer boyfriend put a blanket around her, but didn't stop her or remove her from the party. She just wouldn't stop crying. So I stormed out. I couldn't handle that type of tantrum. She sounded like how my little sister acted as a kid. I hate that type of crying.\n\nMy friends chased me and told me I was being dramatic. I personally feel like she ruined the party. They said she's very depressed, but isn't everyone?? They keep saying I need to apologize to *everyone* involved but I don't see the big deal.

I'll text you and let's catch up over coffee or wine.\" then quietly left, then I would have ruled otherwise.  But you didn't.

I mean, you were literally the only one at the party who was bothered by it at all. \n\nSeveral commenters here have suggested that you were BOTH \"causing drama\" . . . but even your own account doesn't indicate that. No one who was actually at the party found her dramatic or thought she was having a \"tantrum\" except you.

It isn\u2019t as easy as \u201cgetting over it\u201d or \u201cpowering through\u201d. Some people will literally lay in bed for days, not eating or showering. It\u2019s a headspace that can be impossible to get out of, and even with *years* of therapy and medications it can be very hard to manage. It took nearly 10 years of therapy and trying medications until we found what works for me, and even that isn\u2019t perfect. \n\nI\u2019ve talked to so many people who cannot even comprehend the way it feels in my shoes.

Honestly doesn't sound like they are really your friends but you're tolerated as a friends plus one.", "Seems like no one else felt the night was ruined by YOU throwing a tantrum about something that didn't effect you at all", "You ruined it with your attitude.

How do you know she is always sad?", "But your hissy fit does? Storming off went further to ruin the party than her having the unmitigated gall to feel and express human emotions that you don't approve of. I get that this was emotionally triggering for you because of your childhood experiences with your sister, but your triggers aren't the responsibility of everyone else at the party. They are yours and yours alone. If this happens in the future you should remember that. If you can't, instead of having a tantrum and stomping off just try the Irish Goodbye.

Like a drama queen would do. Mature.", "Yes YTA. You said before you don't even know why she was crying. What if her parent had just died? Would you say the same?", "Sounds like someone is jealous because they didn\u2019t get attention", "Your friends, who were there, were affected and offended. Hence the reason they said you needed to apologize. If you were so quiet and incognito, why did they have to \"chase\" you down and tell you that you had been \"dramatic?\"\n\nI'm not saying at all that you needed to stay at the party and watch a girl cry in the corner. I'm also not saying that you needed to go over and try to comfort some girl you don't know and didn't hit it off with.\n\nOn the other hand, it's not so hard to tell the host, \"I'm not feeling the best and am going to go home. Talk to you later,\" and walk out calmly. It's not even a lie, and it would have saved all the drama.", "Girl, you tried to out drama someone else. That\u2019s why it matters. You felt like this person received too much attention because of dramatics, and so you become dramatic yourself to get the same attention.", "One or more of your *actual* friends likes this girl enough to be empathetic towards her, and bring her around the group. You're definitely the asshole here, because you don't understand what friendship means.", "I mean, your \u201cactual\u201d friends approached you about how your behavior was damaging to them and others and you completely blew them off. That doesn\u2019t sound especially supportive to me. If you can\u2019t trust when the entire group tells you that you\u2019ve done something wrong, you aren\u2019t really friends.

People are nice to newcomers to their group so that they can feel comfortable with being friends long teeeeerm????? That\u2019s such a concept.", "why are you so mad that your friends have empathy for someone they just met who is having a rough time? there isn't some quota that people have to meet before they deserve support. if you don't like the dynamic, take some space from your friend group or tell them in private NOT while they're having a get-together, but having a tantrum of your own because you don't like the vibes at the party is childish.", "Adults cry BUT they don\u2019t throw tantrums because another person is crying.  I understand your frustration because it\u2019s cookout and tears soured the mood but your dramatic exit added tension.  You know she\u2019s a crier so let her be, she is not your responsibility.

She's been depressed since childhood like everyone else.", "So she said: \"I am always sad.\" And you thought: \"What a bitch.\"", "You sound bitter and jealous.

Thats not how this works.", "I don\u2019t doubt this girl was annoying, but I don\u2019t think you come out of this smelling of roses.\n\nYour complete lack of empathy, obvious anger and willingness to throw your own tantrum doesn\u2019t show you in the best light. \n\nThe only goal you\u2019ve achieved is to make her look like a victim and you look like an AH.", "lol grow up. Use your words.", "You don\u2019t get to decide who your friends hang out with. This is toxic controlling behaviour, you know that right? You couldn\u2019t stand that she got some attention so you threw a fit of dramatics to try and get them to ditch her. \n\nI\u2019d love for you to tell your friend group that \u201cI stormed out and was dramatic because I want you to ditch this girl because she\u2019s dramatic\u201d, watch how fast you\u2019re the one who\u2019s dropped for being toxic. You were literally the only person who got offended that she was crying. If this did turn out to be her attention seeking then the group will tire of it on their own, alls you\u2019ve done is shown you\u2019re the same.", "They definitely now see one of you in that light.  And it's not her.", "But why do they need to drop her lol, she\u2019s a person too, why are you being so gross?", ">The goal was to make them see that this girl is annoying at best and awful at worst\n\nCongratulatiobs. You just make everyone see how much a diva you are.\n\n>and get them to drop her.\n\nHow awful it's this?!

You haven't even bothered to ask what's wrong or why she's crying to determine whether there's an actual problem or whether she's just doing it to get attention. So you're just throwing a hissy fit of your own. That's really immature. \n\nInstead of throwing a hissy fit, open your mouth and have a conversation if you're trying to communicate anything to your friends. But before you try to communicate to your friends that this girl is annoying and awful, maybe you should learn something about her beyond appearances.

Grow up.", "Unfortunately, all you've done is show them that you are annoying at best and awful at worst and get them to drop you. You should have COMMUNICATED, like an adult.
