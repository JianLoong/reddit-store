My friends are all in their 30s cause I met them through my husband 32M. \n\nOne of my friends threw a little cookout/get together a week ago to celebrate the weather finally warming up for good. It was a very nice party, just around 10 of us. \n\nOne of the guys there brought his new girlfriend. She seemed like a sweet girl at first, so I didn't pay much attention. She was quiet and clung to her boyfriend and kinda killed the mood though. \n\nAs it got later, she started to change though. She seemed restless, sad, and pouty. Everyone fawned over her. She sat down in a corner to sulk. \n\nAnd then she started crying. It was like watching a train wreck in slow motion. She was fine one minute and absolutely sobbing the next. Crying in a corner for no damn reason. \n\nHer boyfriend put a blanket around her, but didn't stop her or remove her from the party. She just wouldn't stop crying. So I stormed out. I couldn't handle that type of tantrum. She sounded like how my little sister acted as a kid. I hate that type of crying.\n\nMy friends chased me and told me I was being dramatic. I personally feel like she ruined the party. They said she's very depressed, but isn't everyone?? They keep saying I need to apologize to *everyone* involved but I don't see the big deal. They're putting the feelings of a girl they just met over me who's been their friend for years. She doesn't even know it happened. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I didn't expect this to blow up. I've been talking to my husband about it. I'm going to apologize and try to befriend her. He says she's very depressed and having a hard time existing, and I kinda feel bad. Apparently she likes me but is she. \n\nAnd for the record, I didn't cause a scene like everyone is assuming. I just left and a few of my friends followed me. They understand why I was upset now.

Pathetic.", "YTA\n\nNot because you left the party, but you threw your own tantrum when you left the party.  You were upset with the drama she was causing so you acted EXACTLY the same and caused your own drama.  If you had just made a polite excuse along the lines of \"I need to get going as husband I have this event in the morning.  I'll text you and let's catch up over coffee or wine.\" then quietly left, then I would have ruled otherwise.  But you didn't.  You threw your own tantrum because the party didn't have the vibe you wanted.\n\nI'm not going to comment on the girl's boyfriend or what should have happened.  This is about how you handled it and you handled it poorly.", "\n\nAm I the only who thinks this whole situation is a little odd? OP, you didn\u2019t have to storm out and I have to say that I agree with your friends, you were definitely being dramatic. I understand you didn\u2019t appreciate the \u201ctantrum\u201d she threw but did anyone ask her what was wrong or try to understand why the sudden mood shift? Her man just throws a blanket over her and that\u2019s it?\n\nETA: I\u2019ve read through your comment history and I\u2019m changing my judgement to YTA. You really should apologize to everyone for your childish, immature behavior and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s not \u201calways sad\u201d. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a history and she\u2019s probably been dealing with things for a long time. You don\u2019t have to be empathic but there\u2019s no need to be disrespectful. \n\nEdit: I\u2019ll just take out the comment about causing a scene because I wasn\u2019t there so I can\u2019t say that for sure. It was the wording in the initial post that made me think that.", "Yta lol you stormed out cause some girl was crying in the corner and was getting attention from others?\n\nYou 18?  You come off as jealous some girl is getting attention instead of you", "INFO: In your esteemed opinion what should their priorities be?", "ESH. This whole situation seems really weird. There has to be a reason she was crying or something that upset her. No one asked? Also, you didn't need to *storm* out.

While her behaviour wasn\u2019t great, your reaction was unnecessary and very childish.", "YTA. \n\nYou admit you \"didn't pay attention\" to her besides being upset that she dared be quiet and hang around with her boyfriend, but magically know there is \"no damn reason\" for her to cry. \n\nThen, when people dared to comfort her, you cause childish drama by throwing a hissy fit and \"stormed out.\" Funny how you say you hate tantrums but threw one far worse than hers. \n\nThen, when people told you that you were wrong and tried to make you own up to it, you doubled down on your assholery and made it a competition between your mental state vs hers, the levels of attention your friends paid you vs her.\n\nGrow up and apologize for your actions. Learn and do better.", "YTA. Like you said everyone has points in life where they are depressed that means anyone can break down at a random point, even you.

I mean, you were literally the only one at the party who was bothered by it at all. \n\nSeveral commenters here have suggested that you were BOTH \"causing drama\" . . . but even your own account doesn't indicate that. No one who was actually at the party found her dramatic or thought she was having a \"tantrum\" except you. They ALL found your theatrics shocking and inappropriate, though, again by your own description. Even when you're trying to tell on her, you're telling on yourself. \n\nYTA, and it seems the instigator and drama queen of your social set. It also seems like people are getting tired of it, and of your inability to think about anyone other than yourself. I'd tread carefully if I were you. You admit that you met all of \"your\" friends through your husband. Annoy them enough and soon you'll just be unwelcome, wife-of-their-friend or not.", "WTF did I just read?  The young lady wasn\u2019t bothering anyone. Yet your exit was so dramatic your friends request you apologize.  Get over yourself and start behaving like an adult.

First off you don't know why she is depressed and depression is very serious. Yes you could be also depressed  but for different reasons and she could be worse at coping causing her to breakdown. She was probably overwhelmed and wanted stay put. You could have left quietly but you \"stormed out\" causing  more of a scene. I do think you should apologize to her. YTA op.", "YTA\n\nCan you not put a little outside perspective on the situation?\n\nMaybe she had been through a recent event and people were reassuring her\n\nBeing the main character, you decided it was being fawned over then one upped her \u2018attention needing\u2019 behaviour by storming out\n\nI truly hope the next nice get together this caring group has 9 people attending \n\nWith you not being invited, obviously", "YTA and the only one to have any issue with this.

Don't try to stop me!!! Me! Me! MMMEEE!!!", "YTA - Leaving quietly is fine, but you seem to have made a dramatic exit which was not required.  Sounds like you were jealous of the attention the other girl was getting.", "ESH. It's all very ridiculous. You had the chance to be the bigger person. Leaving the party is ok, but you decided to make tantrum exactly like her. And your friends didn't help by encouraging the drama.", "YTA for also throwing a tantrum.", "YTA, you don't like tantrums so you threw a tantrum. Was it because she was getting more attention or a lack of empathy?", "YTA. I think you ruined the party more then the crying girl did by making this huge scene without proper cause for it. So dramatic! \n\nAnd btw, not everyone is always depressed. That's a ridiculous statement.", "ESH. Having a breakdown during a party isn't... good. And not leaving is kind of an asshole move. That being said 'storming' out over it is dramatic. I don't know the right way to handle this situation but storming out was for sure the wrong way.", " Oh honey\u2026. Are you sure you are not about 15 years younger than you say you are? Your behavior is deeply childish, dramatic, insecure and just bonkers.", "Uh. Babe. You're really getting this upset about someone else being upset? You can totally roll your eyes and quietly think to yourself that maybe she's a bit of a drama queen, but not if you're going to be equally dramatic. YTA.", "YTA - You  have a lot of hostility towards the gal who was depressed.     You must be projecting for it to trigger you so badly.", "YTA.  For all you know she's grieving a death, or just got horrible news and her bf talked her into going out to \"make her feel better\".  Where's your basic humanity.\n\nWHAAAAAA!!! I'm leaving because someone cried and spoiled my mood.....WHAAAAA!  Is how you sound.", "YTA. So you don't like someone else's emotional outbursts, but your own are fine? \n\n\"Alright, I'm calling it a night.

Depression isn\u2019t a cookie cutter blanket term for everyone who experiences sadness, grief, anxiety. Being depressed and having long-term depression are very different and not *everyone* is depressed. \n\nFor some people depression is debilitating. For some people their quality of life is terrible. It isn\u2019t as easy as \u201cgetting over it\u201d or \u201cpowering through\u201d. Some people will literally lay in bed for days, not eating or showering. It\u2019s a headspace that can be impossible to get out of, and even with *years* of therapy and medications it can be very hard to manage. It took nearly 10 years of therapy and trying medications until we found what works for me, and even that isn\u2019t perfect. \n\nI\u2019ve talked to so many people who cannot even comprehend the way it feels in my shoes. I\u2019ve talked to so many people who I cannot believe are powering through some shit. \n\nEnd of the day - you have no idea what she *feels* and only how she *acts* which are incredibly different. \n\nYour friends were being empathetic and it doesn\u2019t matter if they knew her for 3 weeks or 3 years - it\u2019s someone important to their friend and they wanted to comfort her and let her know she\u2019s safe. It *seems* like she was outside of her comfort zone, trying to be a good sport, and something got to her. \n\nYou\u2019re being a brat. Plain and simple. I\u2019ve consoled literal strangers who I\u2019ve found crying, with no assumption that they\u2019re attention seeking.

I can understand not wanting a party ruined by someone that just randomly cries or being negative or whatever. But consider this, put yourself into the girl's shoes. You got with your new boyfriend recently (let's say a few weeks ago or a few months ago) but you're possibly going thru some stuff (maybe this time last year your dad or sibling died or something and it just leaves you in a weird funk sometimes).

Then there's this person in the same room, glaring at you and then they throw a big ass huff as everyone else is trying their best to comfort you. But because you can't control your emotions, the person bitching about you crying makes you feel like the worst person on the earth. You were  fine and just needed to let things out and cry a bit then you'd be okay but that person who is acting so aggressive and angry and blaming you for ruining the party or ruining THEIR night is making you feel like shit, like you're just a burden and that your feelings dont even matter.\n\nHonestly have you never randomly bursted into tears out in public and not know why except for maybe stress or emotions just simply building up? Yea they were \"fawning\" over the girl but they werent fawning or coddling her. They were making sure she was okay. And the reason she possibly ignored you was probably because she was trying to take a moment to either calm herself down to prevent herself from crying or at that point in time when you engaged her, she was probably wanting to be left alone. You storming off the way you did made you seem childish. \n\nTell me, are you the only female that is brought to your husband's friend group? Is it possible that you were jealous of another female there, one who took away all the attention you were getting? I mean I know you said in another comment that no one fawned over you and  that everyone was equal but in a friend group, consisting of nearly all men, girls will get more attention than the guys in the same friend group regardless of what your relationship is to everyone. And sometimes in that mostly male friend group, one of the guy friends brings along a new girlfriend and that new girl will get the attention that the females, who were already there, already had. So maybe the girls who were there first would get jealous.\n\nYou must ask your self,  why did that girl bursting into tears bother you so much? Was it worth acting aggressive, petty, and childish? Just as your feelings are valid so are the feelings of that girl. I dont care if she had depression since childhood or if everyone has depression and that she should get over it. You, too, have depression (I'm assuming you do because you said in another response that everyone in your friend group has depression). So does that mean you have to get over it too? You, too, can cry, it's okay to cry. No one can  truly control their emotions, let alone when and where they cry.

I don\u2019t think it really matters if you know the girl well. If she\u2019s new to your group, and is clearly very depressed and your friends are saying the same thing, storming off likely only made her feel worse. I\u2019m sure it was hard for her to be there in such a vulnerable state, but she tried it and went and ended up crying. We should be creating safe spaces with our friends for everyone who needs it. Not judging people we don\u2019t even know and taking something that isn\u2019t about us personally. It sounded like you were triggered bc it reminded you of your sister crying, which is a valid feeling, but as an adult you realize that this isn\u2019t the same situation, she isn\u2019t your sister, and if she\u2019s crying that much something must be wrong. Idk why we all have these insecurities about people being \u201cattention seekers\u201d. Bc I do think those are personal insecurities we project onto others as a result of living in a system that highly values hyper independence and stigmatizes emotional distress or displays of emotion. She clearly was having a hard time and if it made you uncomfortable, you could\u2019ve just told a friend you were feeling uncomfortable and walked out quietly without storming off. It doesn\u2019t matter if you think you made a scene. When someone storms off, it always is a scene. I think it\u2019s just important that you mature a little and realize that  there\u2019s no competition between you and anyone new, bc it sounds like you felt competitive when you said that she\u2019s new and you\u2019ve been their friend longer, implying that they should\u2019ve told her to leave? Not sure what your point was with saying that but it doesn\u2019t sound very kind unfortunately. There was nothing to pick sides over, except you made it an awkward situation by pitting her against you bc she cried in front of some new friends. I do suggest apologizing to her specifically, as well as the friends that were there, bc these are the kinds of things that can lead to bigger rifts down the line. It\u2019s ok to feel whatever you feel, it\u2019s just about how you act or don\u2019t act on those feelings. For instance, it\u2019s ok to feel uncomfortable but then it\u2019s important to try and figure out why that made you so uncomfortable that you had to storm out. It will only benefit you to be more introspective around your behavior and will help strengthen your relationships. Trust me, I get it. I was the 25 year old in a friend group of mostly 31-35 year olds bc I was dating a 31 year old and it\u2019s been a few years but looking back I realize how immature some of my reactions were, and it makes me cringe to think about. But it\u2019s ok it\u2019s a part of life and growing as people, and you came here seeking advice and suggestions, which is a good sign. Just apologize and work to befriend the new girl. It will make you feel better and it will mean the world to her, especially since she\u2019s struggling so much to merely exist. Wishing you all the best and I hope you are able to grow closer and befriend someone who you didn\u2019t treat very well initially. It\u2019s the only way to make that right.", "It sounds like he sister was actually the one fawned over and when this girl was crying, it brought OP back to her childhood.

After awhile I finally said \"So...can we turn the movie back on?\" She glared at me but I didn't know what else to say.
