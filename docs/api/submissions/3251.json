If his parents had given you the house then it would be in your name. The fact is they could kick you out any time, and they would benefit from the money you put into it while you will lose that money and not be able to afford the deposit on a house of your own. There was an article a few days ago where someone rented a place, spent tens of thousands fitting a new kitchen, bathroom etc and they were then kicked out. Don't throw money away into a property you don't own. Painting etc is fine. Buy furniture that you can take with you, and keep the receipts!", "NTA \n \nSplitting the cost 50/50 is fair to me. Your husband\u2019s luck in being born into a family that can afford to get y\u2019all a house doesn\u2019t actually count as him contributing to the housing situation, since uh\u2026 it didn\u2019t require any effort on his part. \n \nBut the bigger questions to me are - \n \n- Why are they \u201cgiving\u201d you a house but keeping it in your FIL\u2019s name? My guess is that prenup, which is a huge red flag to me, personally. Let\u2019s say you both move into this house, you spend your savings renovating it, and you live there for 10 years. I bet you that any house maintenance that needs to be done will also be a battle like this one, with him saying you live there for free because of his parents so your contribution is to pay for upkeep. Then (knock on wood this doesn\u2019t happen), you get a divorce. The house is in FIL\u2019s name, which means you get nothing from the house. You can\u2019t even fight for the house in the divorce. They could just tell you to leave and you\u2019d have to walk out the door without anything, after having lived there and put money into it. Also, hypothetically, if you have kids and then end up getting a divorce, he\u2019ll be able to tell the court that he has a house that the kids have been raised in, a stable living situation, and meanwhile you will probably be scrambling to figure out where to live and if you can afford it. To me the FIL keeping the house in his name is controlling, you\u2019re 100% right that it\u2019s not a gift at all. For it to be a \u201cgift\u201d for your wedding he\u2019d have to actually give it to you. \n \n- Your husband chose the designer, worked on the designs and made the decisions. And somehow, miraculously, the cost of the renovations (which you didn\u2019t have input into) is right around what you have in your savings? Wow. What a coincidence (/s). \n \n- Your plan was for you to pay the downpayment, and your husband to pay the mortgage. And now his family has \u201cgiven\u201d you this house, which means there isn\u2019t a mortgage. So your husband doesn\u2019t have to spend his own money on the mortgage. Yet he still expects you to spend the money you were saving for the downpayment, to renovate the house without him splitting it with you? How is that fair?  \n \nThe thing is this. \n- Your husband\u2019s parent\u2019s money is not your husband\u2019s money. So if *they* give you as a couple a gift, then it is not the same as *him* doing something for you as a couple. \n- Your FIL didn\u2019t give you that house as a couple as a wedding present. He bought a house and is letting you live there without paying rent. This is awesome! 100%, very cool of him! But it is *not* the same as giving you a house. Especially with the pre-nup in there. \n- in my opinion if *you* are expected to pay for the renovations etc, then *you* should be the one to choose what they are and how much to spend on them. Not that you should sink money into a house you don\u2019t own, but still. \n- If you buy a bunch of furniture for this house now, with the savings you had from *before* the marriage, then do *you* own all that furniture yourself? Or are you and your husband considered co-owners of it? I\u2019m betting your husband will feel like he owns it too. Is that fair? \n \nDon\u2019t even get me started on questions re: paying for major renovations, how homeowners vs renters insurance is supposed to work, etc etc \n \nYou may want to consider sitting down with someone and your husband and discussing it\u2026 best of luck to you.", "NTA\n\nYour logic makes sense. If they were gifting you the house it would be a different story. But they aren\u2019t. There is a significant difference between allowing you to live in a house rent free and actually giving you the house.", "NTA. \"His contribution\" isn't his, it's his parents'. It is completely fair for you two to both pitch in to furnish the home.", "NTA\n\nIt's pretty sus in my opinion to call it a gift, but keep it in FIL's name. Technically speaking, you're just a renter unless the house is transferred to your husband. And he should be paying equally for any renovations to the house.\n\nYou've also listed off a number of great points why you should be worried in the future. And just cause his family isn't fighting over money now doesn't mean it won't happen in the future. I've known a few people who went from being calm and collected to frothing at the mouth when it comes to collecting their \"rightful\" inheritance.", "I was expecting to get mad from that title but NTA\n\nAs generous a gift as this is, until it's in both you and husband's names it isn't your house. It's his father's that you are able to live in but spending almost as much of your money as you were going to spend as a downpayment does not make sense. Once it's in your names you can split costs 50/50, this does not count as his fair share because his parents were able to give the head start.", "NTA split the cost of furnishing the home sounds fair to me", "NTA\n\nYou're very wise to not allow your husband to spend your money on furnishings which won't hold any value.  And you're also wise to realize that \"your\" house isn't actually yours.\n\nYou and your husband should choose your furniture together and you should split the costs fairly from current income.  \n\nKeep your money for your own future needs.  Invest it wisely.  There may come a day where you need your money to get yourself out of a bad situation.", "Maybe you could furnish it more affordably if you didn\u2019t use an interior designer from a big name architecture firm.

NTA", "NTA, your concerns are valid and you need to have a long talk with your husband. The title is in his father's name, not his or yours, and he didn't pitch in at all, he dad did. How do your in laws treat gifts? Are they the type to say \"I got you this so you should/have to do this.\"? Will they just drop by unannounced and use the excuse that it's their house too? Did you even have a say in what the furniture looks like?", "NTA. It's not yours.", "NTA. If that house isn\u2019t in your name it\u2019s not considered marital property. If you split Daddy gives him the house and you get half of the furniture.\n\nSay you\u2019ll do it once your name is on the title. Until then, since it\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d you split expenses 50/50. If not he\u2019s double-dipping.\n\nEdit: typos.", "Nta spilt costs and keep a record of everything that's yours", "NTA, treat it as you would do a rental but use the free rent to save and buy your own place soon.  If you split up you\u2019d be homeless and any money invested gone", "NTA- the house isn\u2019t in your names this it\u2019s not your house.. even if it was it\u2019s a gift to both of you so your husband expecting you to pay for 100% of the remodeling doesn\u2019t make sense either\u2026", "NTA. You are 100000% right. At any time his parents could kick you or both of you out. If something happens to your husband, will they let you stay in the house? There are so many unknowns when you don't own the house.", "You are 100% correct to be approaching this the way you are. You should not be putting all of your money down to buy stuff it should be split 50-50 especially since his dad\u2018s name is on the deed.  The furnishings will depreciate tremendously and if you did divorce he would expect half of them", "Nta....for all common sense purposes we all know who the house belongs to....we all know the truth when it comes down to judgements and unless FIL is willing to sign the house over to BOTH of you there is no way you should put any money into that house.", "NTA his parents are letting you use a house. If it\u2019s not in you and your husband\u2019s name it\u2019s not your or his house. Stand firm. You\u2019re being reasonable.", "NTA. That house isn't in your name; it's not a gift to you. If hubby wanted to contribute, it world be different.", "NTA.  Don't sink all of your savings into that house alone.  Like everything else in your life, make a plan, to 50/50 and have a contract with all the details documented.  Your questions are valid.  What if dad gives the house to another sibling, or needs it for himself?", "NTA. They didn\u2019t give you the house. Your in-laws have given you a (revocable) opportunity to live there without paying rent. Generous, for sure, but far from the gift they are claiming it to be. As for your husband trying to take credit for his parents\u2019 gift, that\u2019s shady. If you\u2019re going to furnish the house, you should both chip in equally", "NTA. Ask for the house to be put in both your names and you\u2019ll happily use all the money to go nuts decorating it. Copper knobs. Conversation starters. Shocking art. Whatever the heck you both desire.", "NTA. I cant fault your concerns.", "NTA Like you said, the house remains in his parents' names. So, if you divorce, you'll get no equity from it. I would not spend your money on anything that you cannot physically take out of the house. So, no kitchen remodel, landscaping, closet builds, etc. Let your husband pay for those items as his contribution. I would also revise your pre-nup to say that anything you purchase for the house using the money you saved prior to the marriage is 100% yours, appliances, furniture, etc., even if you decide to buy a car with that money, you need to specify that it's not community property.\n\nETA: Your FIL basically made an *investment* in real estate and is \"allowing\" you and your husband to maintain his investment for him. If it was truly a gift, he would have let you choose the house and given you $XXX,XXX towards it. What he did is controlling, and it's detracting from the equity the two of you could be building if you had bought your own house. You should still consider buying real estate/stocks/some other investment with the money you saved, since those tend to appreciate in value, but most other items like furniture, a kitchen, roof, cars, or appliances will only depreciate in value.", "If the house is in your FIL's name, they didn't give you anything.

He thought that money was going towards the future and asked for it to pay, assuming you guys won't need it anymore. I don't know why he won't pay half so that makes him a little asshole but more entitled than anything. I don't know why your fil didn't gift you the deed to the house? It's not your house if there's no contract. That's like if you got married and didn't sign paperwork. They're just letting you stay there rent free like you said, but it's not your house. And you aren't doing anything wrong by wanting to protect your assets that you had a plan for that has now changed. It's yours to do what you want with and if that means something different to your husband he unfortunately doesn't have a say.", "NTA\n\nIf the house is a gift, it should be in your names.

It\u2019s not your husband\u2019s contribution. It doesn\u2019t mean you have to \u2018match\u2019 it with funds of your own.", "NTA. And your husband's flawed logic is a bit of a red flag. Don't sink your money into the house at this time.\n\nEdited for corrections", "NTA\n\n> \"he feels his part of pitching in is by having a parents that provide the house\"\n\nLMAO", "So, let me get this straight... Your husband will no longer have to pay for a mortgage, so expecting you to spend everything you were contribute is insane.

It's impossible to know what is going to happen in the future.  It's safe to think that FIL has deed in his name because he is making the monthly payment (unless he paid cash) and that he won't change his mind and retract the gift.
