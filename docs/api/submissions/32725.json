She's 9 years older than me (17f). Her dad died when she was 5, mom remarried to my dad when she was 8 and got pregnant with me straight away. Until I was 10 I thought she was the best person ever and I wanted us to have a relationship like my friends had with their siblings. But she has rejected me as \"not being her real sister\" from day one. She also rejects my dad as anything other than \"my mother's fuck buddy\" and she has called him that to his face and in front of other people. My dad always lets it slide and mom will tell her we're a family, to which my half sister will say *she's* family but my dad and I are not.\n\nWhen I was 6 my brother was stillborn when mom was about 6 months pregnant with him. She had grandma come over to watch my half sister and me while she was in the hospital and we were told something happened to our brother. I was really upset because I had been so excited and wanted comfort from my half sister. She told me to grow the fuck up and stay away from her. She also told me it was a shame the same thing didn't happen when mom was expecting me. Grandma was horrified and told her she would regret saying that but my half sister told her she wouldn't regret saying that about someone she didn't love. \n\nThe breaking point was that Christmas when I was 10. She decided to stay with a different family member for Christmas but did show up to our grandparents for Christmas Day celebrations. I was excited to see her and thought the fact she showed up meant she might like me now. But after I had tried talking to her she turned on me and said she didn't give a fuck about me or my life and did not want me to know anything about hers. She called me pathetic and asked why she would care about someone like me. She told me if she could turn back time she would have begged for mom to have an abortion with me because I was disgusting. It was that point where I think I hit the point where I was like you know what, fine.\n\nOver the last 7 years I have seen her maybe 3 times. She avoids being where I will be and she has made it clear to mom that if mom wants to see her, dad and I are not welcome and we are not invited into her life. Except now she's getting married and she invited me and wanted me there because questions were asked. Mom was so happy when my half sister told her she really wanted me there. Mom was so eager to tell me. My half sister even showed up to invite me personally. But I told her I would not go. She explained she needed me and why and I told her I will not make her look better by showing up. I said she wants me dead, I don't want her in my life, it's as simple as that.\n\nMom cried that we're siblings and I told her I lost my only sibling when my brother was stillborn. That he would have been my only sibling, because my half sister sure as shit wasn't a sibling for me. She made it clear many times over she did not want to be.\n\nMy half sister and mom both feel I'm really in the wrong.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702209980, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18f27ok/aita_for_refusing_to_make_my_half_sister_look/", "score": 217, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason I might be TA and more in the wrong than her is she is asking me, she came over to invite me herself and made an effort, even if not for great reasons.

Not half sisters, just sisters.\nI\u2019m sorry you never had the sister you deserved and that your parents allowed that abuse to carry on for so long. You sister knows she did wrong by you for a very long time and it seems sorry will not be anywhere near enough to forgive her. She doesn\u2019t want her partner to know what a nightmare she\u2019s been to you. Your parents needs to know why. I\u2019m not sure if your grandma ever told them about what she witnessed when you were six yrs old but they need to know everything. Sit them down and tell them. If that will be difficult. write a letter and sit them down and make them read it. It would take years of counselling to undo the damage your half sister\u2019s verbal abuse and cruel behaviours towards you - they need to realise this and soon. I cannot believe your Mom is being so blind - I\u2019m disappointed for you. NTA by light years", "NTA your Mum really messed up big time here. She's the cause of this, not your half-sister. She had a young kid who was grieving the death of her Dad. Married with a new baby 2 years after starting to date your Dad, that's a lot of big changes in a short timeline for a child that's grieving. Especially when the child made it clear before the wedding she doesn't want \"a new Dad and siblings\". Maybe if your Mum hadn't kept pushing her eldest to see you and your Dad as family, or explained to you why your half-sister doesn't want to be your big sister, you all could have calmly co-existed.\n\nBut here she is, all these years later, still pushing. Except now she's pushing you to \"forgive and forget\". Your Mum is doing this because she feels guilty. She didn't provide her eldest child enough support after she lost her Dad, didn't slow down her relationship to give her time to adjust. And then she didn't protect you from her eldest daughter's verbal abuse, she pushed you into it, prioritising her hope for a blended family. She needs you to show up at the wedding so she can convince herself and show everyone el else she has a happy nuclear family.\n\nTo paraphrase Taylor Swift, unsubscribe from this narrative.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
