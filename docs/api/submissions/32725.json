She's 9 years older than me (17f). Her dad died when she was 5, mom remarried to my dad when she was 8 and got pregnant with me straight away. Until I was 10 I thought she was the best person ever and I wanted us to have a relationship like my friends had with their siblings. But she has rejected me as \"not being her real sister\" from day one. She also rejects my dad as anything other than \"my mother's fuck buddy\" and she has called him that to his face and in front of other people. My dad always lets it slide and mom will tell her we're a family, to which my half sister will say *she's* family but my dad and I are not.\n\nWhen I was 6 my brother was stillborn when mom was about 6 months pregnant with him. She had grandma come over to watch my half sister and me while she was in the hospital and we were told something happened to our brother. I was really upset because I had been so excited and wanted comfort from my half sister. She told me to grow the fuck up and stay away from her. She also told me it was a shame the same thing didn't happen when mom was expecting me. Grandma was horrified and told her she would regret saying that but my half sister told her she wouldn't regret saying that about someone she didn't love. \n\nThe breaking point was that Christmas when I was 10. She decided to stay with a different family member for Christmas but did show up to our grandparents for Christmas Day celebrations. I was excited to see her and thought the fact she showed up meant she might like me now. But after I had tried talking to her she turned on me and said she didn't give a fuck about me or my life and did not want me to know anything about hers. She called me pathetic and asked why she would care about someone like me. She told me if she could turn back time she would have begged for mom to have an abortion with me because I was disgusting. It was that point where I think I hit the point where I was like you know what, fine.\n\nOver the last 7 years I have seen her maybe 3 times. She avoids being where I will be and she has made it clear to mom that if mom wants to see her, dad and I are not welcome and we are not invited into her life. Except now she's getting married and she invited me and wanted me there because questions were asked. Mom was so happy when my half sister told her she really wanted me there. Mom was so eager to tell me. My half sister even showed up to invite me personally. But I told her I would not go. She explained she needed me and why and I told her I will not make her look better by showing up. I said she wants me dead, I don't want her in my life, it's as simple as that.\n\nMom cried that we're siblings and I told her I lost my only sibling when my brother was stillborn. That he would have been my only sibling, because my half sister sure as shit wasn't a sibling for me. She made it clear many times over she did not want to be.\n\nMy half sister and mom both feel I'm really in the wrong.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702209980, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18f27ok/aita_for_refusing_to_make_my_half_sister_look/", "score": 10038, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The reason I might be TA and more in the wrong than her is she is asking me, she came over to invite me herself and made an effort, even if not for great reasons.

I\u2019m not sure if your grandma ever told them about what she witnessed when you were six yrs old but they need to know everything. Sit them down and tell them. If that will be difficult. write a letter and sit them down and make them read it.

Married with a new baby 2 years after starting to date your Dad, that's a lot of big changes in a short timeline for a child that's grieving. Especially when the child made it clear before the wedding she doesn't want \"a new Dad and siblings\". Maybe if your Mum hadn't kept pushing her eldest to see you and your Dad as family, or explained to you why your half-sister doesn't want to be your big sister, you all could have calmly co-existed.\n\nBut here she is, all these years later, still pushing. Except now she's pushing you to \"forgive and forget\". Your Mum is doing this because she feels guilty. She didn't provide her eldest child enough support after she lost her Dad, didn't slow down her relationship to give her time to adjust. And then she didn't protect you from her eldest daughter's verbal abuse, she pushed you into it, prioritising her hope for a blended family. She needs you to show up at the wedding so she can convince herself and show everyone else she has a happy nuclear family.\n\nTo paraphrase Taylor Swift, unsubscribe from this narrative.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We both know how you truly feel about me, you've made it clear since I was small. You hate me, you wish I was dead, and I am not a part of your family. Not only that, but you seem to feel that everything you've said and the way you've treated me is justified and acceptable, which is why you've never once taken any of it back or tried to make amends. That being the case, you should have no problem with my not attending, and you should be happy to tell your guests the truth about why I'm not there, because you believe that you're right. Go ahead and tell them that I'm not there because you hate me and I'm not part of your family, and that you wish I'd been miscarried or aborted. \n\n\"Either that or you know that the way you've treated me is wrong. You know that you've been hateful and cruel for no other reason than because I exist, and you don't want to have to explain to people why I'm not there because you know it will make you look bad. However, if that is the case, instead of sincerely apologising and trying to be a better person to me, you've decided to try and brow-beat me into attending so that you can feel better about yourself, and so that if I say no, you can claim that I'm the villain, rather than this being a natural consequence of your actions; you want me to be the bad guy so you don't have to be, but we both know the truth. \n\n\"Irrespective of the reasoning, I will not be attending. Weddings are a time for families, and I am not family to you. It's a time to be with the people you love, and you do not love me. You can answer any questions about my absence, although bear in mind that should anyone be given the wrong idea about the situation, I will have to correct those misrepresentations, as I will not have my reputation tarnished just so that you can save face. I do hope you have a nice wedding, but I will not attend and lie to people so that you can play happy families. You created this situation, and now you can deal with it.\"", "Why has your mother allowed her to disrespect your dad by calling his her 'fuck buddy'?

Sickeningly, graciously, undeservedly sweet.  Wish her the best life she could possibly have with her new husband, express how incredibly happy you are for them, and then be sure to mention that while you'd love to attend you seriously doubt the sincerity of her invitation based on every single other interaction you've ever had.

Extremely neutral and logical.

You don't need that in your life.", "Yep and that\u2019s why I refer to her as trash and trash bitch. It\u2019s one thing if this mega bitch had talked like that to OP when she was a child\u2026.but she wasn\u2019t. She was old enough to know and understand what she was doing by saying that. She was old enough to understand that her dad has been gone a long time and mom has to move on with her life. She was old enough to understand that she missed out on having any kind of a dad, because she pushed her stepfather away right from the get go.", "And she said it to a 10 year old!!! 10!! I feel bad if a 10 year old thinks I looked at them wrong, I can't even imagine telling one they deserve to be dead. And on Christmas, too.", "This. Don\u2019t get involved in her life. I think it would make my relationship with my mom difficult in this situation, so a therapist to help you navigate that relationship going forward through marriages, holidays, births may be helpful to see what boundaries you two need. The sister is not someone I\u2019d put too much effort into. Maintain the distance at this point.", "This is  healthy attitude. I do not understand all those  posts asking you to go and ruin her wedding or relationship.", "What is he meant to do? What practical advice do you have for a husband in the same situation? We have no idea what they tried since op was a child and I assume not privy to every conversation between everyone.", "It's not his place to deal with mom's kid. Mom failed here.", "Correct. And any children from subsequent marriages are actually sealed to the first husband not their biological father. So you don't have to worry about those kids not being \u201cborn in the covenant\u201d even if their parents aren't sealed. \nWhen my SIL went to have her first sealing cancelled so she could get sealed to her husband (who is the bio father of her children) she found out her son was actually sealed to her first husband, whom she had divorced well before meeting her current husband. \n\nThey had to go to the first presidency to get the sealings cancelled so the kid could be sealed to his own father. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44", "You should find a way to tell him how horrifically abusive and cruel she was to you. Yes, use the word abusive. \n\nShe was fucking disgusting, a horrible nasty person with zero moral fiber or worth."]}
