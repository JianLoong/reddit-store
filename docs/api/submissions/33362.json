You have the right to invite who you want for Christmas.\n\nBut I want to add--your mother doesn't have much to talk about with people anymore. She lives in a nursing home for heaven sakes.  You are one of the few things she can talk about, show off and brag about.

I have actually called Mom back and told her to bring her friend with the following caveats. They come for dinner, but the gifts we give Mom she can take home to open so not to make her friend feel bad.", "YTA, how many times did your mom host your friends?", "NTA. I agree that your house is yours and you get to decide who attends any event held there.  Your mother showing off your stuff is just her way of saying, \u201csee my child has all this because I was such a good mother\u201d.  I wouldn\u2019t allow her to bring anyone to the house if that is how she is going to behave.

Your mom being proud of your stuff should be a good thing in my opinion. I'll still go NTA but I think it would be easier to talk through your concerns with your mom", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just to be safe, I hope you'll not even give her those presents until she leaves.  In fact, might be a good idea to tuck them into the trunk or back of the car right now!  And you take over the conversation from the get-go and deputize anyone in the house to do the same, as in give them a list of really basic questions like this to jump in with when your toxic Mom starts with her toxic show:  so, Guest, where did you grow up?  So, Guest, what do you think of where you live now?  So, Guest, what are your hobbies?  So, Guest, do you have any suggestions for the senior center?  And so on and on and on, like have a list of fifty questions that everyone has practiced in the mirror, and make that one of their Christmas presents to you, and do that as Christmas present to yourself.", "You shouldn't have caved to the dumbest comments in the thread. You are not responsible for solving lonely Christmas for random people.", "I would let your mom open her gifts and buy her friend a $10 box of fancy biscuits or inexpensive chocolates. Opening gifts is a huge part of the Christmas fun. Maybe you have an unwanted past gift item floating around the house that you could give her. I usually have a few of those unwanted items on hand.", "I\u2019m sure at some point her mom told her \u201cno it\u2019s not a good night for you to have a friend over.\u201d \u201cNo. You cannot have friends over for Christmas.\u201d", "Thissss", "Are you out inviting every lonely elderly person to your house for Christmas?

I added a comment to the thread.", "Bragging about expensive items is not how any healthy person is proud.", ">Your mom being proud of your stuff should be a good thing in my opinion.\n\nI disagree.  That type of behavior is typical of shallow materialistic people.  OPs mom sounds like my brother's MIL.  She had no boundaries with her children and was extremely materialistic.  OP's mom wants to drag her \"friend\" along to make herself look good by bragging about her daughter's accomplishments.", "I didn't say that what the mom was doing was polite or was/wasn't asshole behavior, I said that it wasn't really a sign of mental illness. People brag about their kids/grandkids, especially when they're older. Sometimes this bragging is annoying or done in a gauche way, but it doesn't mean they've got a mental illness.", "This is perfect! Yes! You get it! You have most definitely earned a t-shirt with someone like Mom along the way. I bought mom luxury items and the drama that would ensue as she opened them  and showed her friend and used them for attention seeking behavior would be vile. If you have not had a person like this in your life, it is hard to explain the nuances.", "And since she doesn't actually know the lady, its ridiculous to *assume* she will be lonely with nothing to look forward to on the holiday anyway.", "I was thinking this as well.", "And I\u2019m sure it was a minority of the time. So suck it up and be an adult.", "In and of it\u2019s self bragging can be normal parent/grandparent behavior. However, there is a long nuanced history of toxic behavior involving my mom and her use of family members for attention seeking. By naming us in church for prayers, telling friends about my personal life (gossip when I was single) so badly that her friend I hardly knew called me in alarm. True story, she forgets what I do for a living and asks me every year or so.\n\nShe calls only when she wants something. She has not called her grandkids in years. Most grandkids and kids do not like her. If you disagree with her, she will fly into a rage.\n\nA cousin had a heart episode and almost died. Mom told me about it saying, \u201c she is my sister\u2019s caregiver, what would she have done without her? It\u2019s a child\u2019s duty to care for their mother. Losing her daughter would have been a tragedy.\u201d Seriously focused on the loss to her sister, not the niece. \n\nIn short, there is an underlying toxic behavior I don\u2019t trust with her \u201caltruism\u201d.", "So glad it helps.  I'm just about done with my Reddit help people time as a break between work and holiday chores and travels, and it's nice to know it was useful.  Cheers and happy happy holidays!", "Totally get it. The real answer is leaving mom out of Christmas. Don\u2019t worry about what she says. Narcissists lie if they don\u2019t have anything to brag about.", "NTA.  Your house, your celebration, your rules.", "NTA. If it makes you feel uncomfortable,  it's reasonable to not invite someone else.", "\"Mom, either come by yourself for Christmas or don't come at all.\" \n\nSimple.", "Honestly, it seems like you're kind of looking to not invite your mom.\n\nThat's not a condemnation of you on my part. It just really seems like it's not about *the friend*. It may be worth it, but ultimately do you *want* your mom to be there?\n\nI definitely know that this is totally none of my business.", "I absolutely understand you OP. People who haven\u2019t interacted with personality disorders will have no frame of reference for your experiences and chalk it up to much more minor \u201cquirks\u201d. You\u2019re not crazy for correctly identifying this disordered behavior. Say no to your mother. What is she gonna do besides tantrum far far away from you lol"]}
