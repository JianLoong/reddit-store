I've never seen anyone give birth. I have a uterus.\n\n_Absolutely NTA_. My gosh, how can some people be so entitled??!! That you let them in the first time is over and above. You owe them nothing.

They had their moment when their children were born. This is you and your husband's moment. Stick to your decision and just keep reiterating however many times is needed that this is your decision. They can go kick rocks. Also let the nurses and security know so the grandparents dont try to force themselves in.", "NTA for Sure. I really dont get this. Why would people want to watch anyone give birth? I have witnessed several births (during my training as a paediatric nurse) and have given birth twice myself. Its not that nice to see.\nAlso nobody has any right to anything except for the person giving birth. Pushing a whole freaking human being out of your body is no walk in the park so you should get to be as comfortable as possible. No discussion. \nMy mum luckily is not one of those,  but my MIL likes to say \"I have the right to..., Im the grandma.\" Tried that a few weeks into my first pregnancy, when I said husband and I did not want visitors right away. Immediatly told her nobody has any rights to my baby except my husband and myself and if she tries to visit before we invite her, she will be left at closed doors.\n\nOP, do not give in. You giving birth is not about your parents or your in laws or anyone . Its your moment and you decide who gets to share it with you. Dont tell anyone when you go into labour and if you have not already, just dont tell them where you plan to give birth. \nHope you can still enjoy your pregnancy, all the best for you and your little one! :)\n\nSorry for any mistakes, Im obviously not a native speaker", "You do not owe them any reasons!! None!!! They really need to get over themselves!!", "NTA\n\n\nThis is a medical procedure, not a concert.  There is no need for an audience.  You invite people you think will be supportive, not people who want to put their own feelings first while they play pass the baby after birth.  \n\n\nMight need to put some other boundaries down too, as I expect them to try to be pushy about your post partum time in general", "NTA\u2026but stop talking about it.  Just do it.  Who will watch your first born?  If you can, try and have anyone other than the grandparents, someone you trust, have the baby and do not tell anyone until you are home.  If you cannot, just say, we will think about it, but don\u2019t say anything until you havre to drop your first born off to go to the hospital and say, we thought about it.  Nope.

Their feelings do not matter in this decision. \n\nI hear they\u2019re struggling with understanding this. Their struggle is also not your problem. \n\nYour vagina, your decision. (Until something goes sideways and way too many doctors get involved, but even then, it\u2019s got nothing to do with grandparent\u2019s feelings. It barely has anything to do with your feelings if an emergency kicks off.) \n\nThis is the time where \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way.\u201d is actually appropriate. You\u2019re not apologizing for your choice, but you\u2019re sympathetic to their discomfort. Which still doesn\u2019t change the decision.", "NTA", "NTA, and don\u2019t attempt another conversation with the grandparents. You said no. The end; there\u2019s no discussion or compromise to be had. If they don\u2019t like it, too bad. Healthy families respect reasonable boundaries.\n\nPersonally, my rule was that if you were not a medical professional or were not present for the conception you could meet the baby after birth.", "NTA\u2026 I\u2019m gonna admit didn\u2019t read it but if you\u2019re giving birth ur opinion and partner are the only ppl that matter. The End", "[deleted]", "NTA", "I think my mother was *relieved* only my husband could be there due to Covid restrictions. Especially since it took 30 hours. Hell, even I didn't want to be there.\n\nNo one owes anyone a birthing show. NTA.", "Abso-freaking-lutely!!  And OP, consider saying nothing for weeks, if you\u2019re able. When they ask why, remind them they decided to disrespect your request with nasty, hurtful and unnecessary comments. I am so sorry you\u2019re even having to deal with this. No one has a \u201cright\u201d to be present during the birth of your child. This is such an outrageous response by them. You deserve better. People who push like this likely don\u2019t respect other boundaries regarding you and your family. My youngest daughter has dealt with similar behavior from her in-laws, so no one besides me and her husband were told when she went into labor. Once my grandson was born, in-law\u2019s were notified - and not until she and my SIL had plenty of time to spend alone with their new baby. I wouldn\u2019t have been present had she requested it. Would it have sucked, sure, but only because I want to shoulder my girl through. Never in a thousand years would I ever consider fighting any decision she made much less say a thing that could hurt her feelings. Parents need to get it together. This behavior is why so many adults are going NC and these types of parents have more than earned it. Best wishes for you, your husband and your newest baby. You\u2019ll do great and you should be proud of yourself for taking a stand. Don\u2019t budge!\n\nETA: definitely NTA!", "Great point, my friend.  Ask a trusted friend to watch your oldest.  NTA.
