People who push like this likely don\u2019t respect other boundaries regarding you and your family. My youngest daughter has dealt with similar behavior from her in-laws, so no one besides me and her husband were told when she went into labor.

Would it have sucked, sure, but only because I want to shoulder my girl through.

Doctor came in to check (my early labor was fairly easy so we didn't rush out the door, and then THERE WAS TRAFFIC) and I was basically ready to go. Like the doctor didn't even have time to change in to scrubs, had the nurses put on the gown and gloves on over her clothes it was that quick, and I believe it had to do more with her getting in the path between me and the doctor who at that point would have had to move out of the way to let my mom out. So I think it was matter of the doctor staying as sterile as possible. It went so fast I didn't even get drugs!! It was seriously bananas. But ended with a perfectly beautiful healthy baby boy who is now a smelly sarcastic wonderful 17yr old.", "Nta. \n\nMy mother was PISSED when I told her we didn't want anybody else other than medical staff in the delivery room.  My husband never had the discussion with his mom, though she had made mention of being in the delivery room.  Fortunately for us I needed a c section, which took care of anybody complaining about not being allowed in.\nThat being said, I really wish people would stop demanding entry into birthing rooms.  I'd never demand my daughter or any future daughter in laws let me be in their delivery rooms.  When did birth become a show for the masses? More importantly, it's 2023, why are people still wanting it to be a spectator event?", "I always find it odd when grandparents demand to be at birth. It's not a thing in UK. I just had hubby for both of mine, in fact we had no visitors for 2 weeks so no one met them until we were ready.\n\nNTA say no - if they have an issue tell them no visits for a week, add more time each time they complain haha", "NTA. My mother insisted to be there when I was in labor with my first because I was only 19.  Everyone there was kicked out for delivery though. My mother was apparently quite hurt that I didn\u2019t pay more attention to her during labor so she decided to stay home for my second one which was fine because I didn\u2019t want anyone there and intended on telling everyone. Thankfully none of my ex\u2019s relatives wanted to be there so it was less of a hassle. You should definitely stick to your guns and keep everyone out. Labor and birth aren\u2019t social events. And nobody but you and your medical staff have any rights to be there including the father. So it\u2019s absolutely fine to keep them out!", "It\u2019s not THEIR moment. They had their kids. They raised them. The end. Ask your MIL and mother who was in their delivery room. NTA. No is a full sentence. Don\u2019t let them bully their way in.", "NTA. \n\nYou should have blamed it on new pandemic rules, though.", "NTA you had entertaining to while giving birth? What is wrong with the grandmothers? They should support you!", "The only person who has a say on who is in the delivery room is the one giving birth.\n\nNTA", "I\u2019m a grandma too of two going to be 3 grandchildren and I can\u2019t imagine being there. I wouldn\u2019t be watching the actual birth. Hell I didn\u2019t even watch my children come out. I refused the mirror. I sure as hell don\u2019t want ti watch my children give birth. Not my desire to see another woman\u2019s area-not even for my grandchildren. I really don\u2019t look at it as a spectator sport or an entertainment moment."]}
