However, why you felt the need to unilaterally scold the entire Turkish student population in the dorm when you could\u2019ve just watched the video first is beyond me. THAT feels like there is a bias you need to unlearn because you felt the need to \u201ctalk to\u201d all of them instead of just finding the guilty culprit and dealing with it appropriately. So for that YTA", "You could have made an announcement to everyone, but instead singled people out by race/ nationality and are now wondering why people think you are racist? YTA", "You could have  handled that a lot better, YTA. You should have called everyone to that meeting and discussed proper coin use", "Yta you literally had a security tape of who did it and chose to bitch out ALL the Turkish students??????", "Should have gathered everyone. Not only should everyone know not to put lira in the vending machine but it just as easily could have been someone else.", "YTA for summoning all (!) the Turkish students BEFORE checking the footage, not just the culprit.", "YTA.\n\nYour assumption is not a bad one, given the money you had. Where you fouled up is treating the Turkish students differently before you had clear proof from the security footage. All you knew is that Turkish coins were used, not Turkish students putting them in.\n\nYou should have treated all the students the same, regardless of your suspicions. Better yet, you should have just used the security footage in the first place to find the actual culprit(s). Even if it was likely a Turkish student or students supplied the coins, it's racist to unfairly implicate ALL the students just by virtue of their ethnicity.\n\nYou've now put a major roadblock in your relationship with those students, who are probably strongly inclined to dislike you and not trust you.", "Yta - how do you know the Turkish students didn\u2019t give other students lira?", "YTA based on you having the security footage. Like if i was in that meeting i'd be pissed because a) it did sound like you're accusing a bunch of foreigners of shit that you had relatively loose evidence on (like other students could've gotten their hands on lira coins) and b) You already were able to find the culprit, why organise a meeting to ask them to come forward when you could just go directly to them and say hey cut it out??\n\nStick up a sign that says no lira coins in the vending machine cause it'll break it.", "YTA for singling out students by race. As if currency exchange is difficult or only Turkish people are interested in scamming vending machines. The notification about incorrect currency should be communicated to all users of the machines.\n\nYTA especially as you had the opportunity to review video footage but instead choose to accuse a racial group first.", "It's a hard one. While there's nothing wrong with assuming people from Turkey use Turkish currency, whether you're being seen as an AH or not strongly depends on the current culture in the place you live in. And the current culture in Europe is such that singling out any nationality, for any reason, automatically makes you an AH regardless of context.", "YTA, you\u2019re no racist for seeing the vending machine had Turkish coins and assuming a Turkish person might have done it. You\u2019re racist for calling a meeting with only the Turkish people and accusing them as a collective. Like seriously why would you think that\u2019s a good idea?", "YTA and a racist for sure, you called a meeting with only the Turkish students instead of everyone with access to the vending machine", "YTA and a dramatic one. All you needed to do was make an announcement to everyone or put a sign on it saying what kind of coins to use and other coins could damage the machine.", "NTA.  The assumption makes sense based on the evidence, and later your suspicions were correct and verified via the security footage.  People need to stop cheapening words like \u201cracism\u201d by throwing them around everywhere at things they don\u2019t like.  It\u2019s not racist to look at the given facts and come to the conclusion that, as the coins breaking the vending machine are Turkish lira, then those putting them in the machine with access to the Turkish lira are probably Turkish.  If I went around paying everyone in Europe Twoonies instead of two euro because the coin looks similar, people would rightly assume it was a Canadian giving them the Twoonies.", "[removed]", "YTA for making a general accusation to a whole group of specific people versus checking the footage.  Like really?", "YTA. You saw your chance to have a go at the Turkish students and took it - instead of simply, ya know\u2026.. watching the damn video in the first place!!!", "YTA and racist and deserved to be fired.", "NTA. Could have been handled better, but it's not racist to figure that a Turkish student was the one using Turkish coins.", "Nta, facts dont make you racist if you have proof. Let your coworker know how wrong they are every time you can.", "I dont think you are an AH, but I am going with ESH. if the school doesnt care, why do you? keep letting them break shit. I would not want to get called racist for trying to do my job correctly. So if I were to, I would stop doing my job correctly.", "YTA and racist for sure. Did the vending machine repair state this was from their coins? Doesn\u2019t sound it. You gathered and blamed a specific ethnicity for something and you don\u2019t think your racist? You know that\u2019s exactly what racism is. \n\nAny person could be using Turkish currency because as you state it\u2019s cheaper. If that is even what\u2019s broken the vending machine. This should\u2019ve been a whole facility talk - not singled to Turkish students.", "NTA\n\nCould have been handled better but you are not racist in this instance.", "NTA, you used basic logic, Mr. (Ms.?) Holmes.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re racist but you could\u2019ve handled it better. It was a perfectly logical assumption", "YTA. Just because your racist assumption happened to be correct in this instance doesn't make it not racist. I remember when I was a teenager people used a specific foreign currency in vending machines that was the same size but lower value. Teens and college students are great at scamming the system. It wouldn't be surprising if a local student figured it out and did the same.", "You weren't wrong for your suspicions (it makes sense that people from Turkey would have easier access or even a reason to have Turkish currency) but you walked yourself into this one. Why not have a general meeting and say that if no one confesses the university would have to check the security footage? I don't think you were racist, but you came across like it for handling it badly. YTA.", "YTA for not talking to everyone. You assumed only a set group would have the lira when currency exchange happens all over the world. It doesn't automatically mean you are racist, but definitely narrow-minded. If you struggle addressing everyone equally, the school might benefit from a change in your current position.", "NTA. If it were dollars you would assume American students. If it were pesos you would suspect Mexican students. It was lira and you suspected Turkish students. It wasn\u2019t about anyone\u2019s race. It was about the currency.", "YTA.  It was indeed a Turkish student who did it.  BUT you didn\u2019t know that at the time.  It could have been a non-Turkish person trying to frame the Turk.", "It's not racist to see Turkish money has ruined the machine and think that maybe a Turkish student did it.  I have no idea if you're racist in general, but it was clear what was happening in this instance\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
