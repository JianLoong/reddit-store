She doesn't live with me, but I've been the one mostly buying her food and clothes and paying for her phone in exchange for babysitting my son when I need it. Lana stays 2 roads away (a 10 min walk tops) at her grandparents after being kicked out by her parents and is often over at my house just hanging out and waiting for if I need help. She used to have a fast food job another 5-10 min walk from my house, but i'd drive her to and from work most days but she recently got fired.\n\nNow, she had a pretty nice deal with her grandparents. $50 every two weeks for rent, she pays for her food that she keeps there and helps with the house. But there was another housemate that would make snide comments about living with a \"crappy no good teenager\" and Lana took major offense to it. \n\nJust yesterday Lana suddenly told me she was moving 30 minutes away THAT NIGHT and wanted me to be the one taking her out to look for work in that area, plus getting her to and from whichever job she gets aince she doesn't have her own car. \n\nWIBTA If I tell her not only will I not be hauling her around that far away but I'll be shutting off the phone service I pay for since she will no longer be able to come babysit?\n\nEDIT/UPDATE: After being found that i would indeed BTA, I sat down with Lana and had a long talk (while also driving her to put in applications near her new home). We decided I'd be her emergency contact at whatever job she gets, I will keep paying for her phone until she has at LEAST one paycheck in the bank and can switch the payment to her card, and I also found out her reason for suddenly moving. She's been having what seems to be paranoid thoughts that her family, particularly her parents, are trying to sabotage and kill her and that moving 30 minutes away to a different city will keep her safe. \n\nMy husband and I also offered if Lana needs to move back to the area for whatever reason, that she can move in with us for no rent or added stipulations other than just keeping the room we're making up for her somewhat tidy.\n\nUPDATE2: yes I know Lana seems to need some sort of mental health help. We came back to my place so she could nap as she asked after dropping the bomb about the thoughts her family are coming after her. Once she wakes up, I'll bring up her possibly needing therapy and we'll go from there.", "created_utc": 1668692733, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yxqp92/wibta_for_not_helping_my_adopted_kid_any_more/", "score": 496, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She babysits for you, you provide her food, clothes and a phone. As such, you feel perfectly justified taking these things away when she stops upholding her end. But it's also pretty obvious that Lana doesn't see your relationship the same way. She sees you as a source of support, maybe even friendship, and therefore feels comfortable asking you for a major favor in order to improve her living conditions.\n\nShe is asking too much from you obviously, but you also aren't the friend she thinks you are.", "ESH, but I\u2019m not sure Lana\u2019s so much an asshole for expecting you to drive her places as hopelessly naive given how thoroughly every single adult in her life seems to have let her down so far.  Why did her parents think it was appropriate to kick her out in the first place?  Why are her grandparents charging a 17 year old rent, much less expecting her to cover all her own expenses and not sticking up for her when even *that\u2019s* not enough for their asshole tenant?  And while, again, you don\u2019t need to drop everything to be her personal Uber driver, what good is your help if it stops the minute you\u2019re no longer getting anything out of the deal?  At least let her keep the phone long enough to line up a replacement.", "NTA try to break it to her gently.\n\nIf that is her decision then this is the cost.  Teaching teenagers decision making is a frustrating process, but you can do it without backing down at all.", "While Lana isn't your responsibility.\n\nIt's also clear that Lana isn't anyone's responsibility she's functionally an orphan.  Even if her family is still alive.\n\nIf you truly have no feelings for her as person, I feel at a minimum you should try and reach out to anyone who potentially would.  Before you cut off your support as well.", "YWBTA - where I'm taking issue here is that OP calls Lana her \"adopted\" kid in the title, but then describes her in terms that makes her sound more like just a babysitter who is getting paid in kind with food and clothes and a phone.  \n\n\nAt the very least, there's a bit of a disconnect here - OP wants to cut off Lana abruptly, which would make sense if Lana is just a babysitter who is abruptly moving away and abruptly cutting off services.  If Lana is just a babysitter, should she be paid in cash, not in-kind?  How much babysitting were we really talking about, and how did the in-kind payments stack up against what would have been the cash payments?  If, on the other hand, Lana is \\*not\\* just a babysitter, if she really is an \"adopted\" kid, then OP should have to roll with the punches a little bit - haul her out to her new place, and give her a grace period of a month before shutting off the phone, because that's the kind of thing you do for \"family\".", "YWBTA. Hey, this poor kid, dude. It sounds like she\u2019s kind of a mess right now, which at 17, with no parents helping her out, makes absolute sense. \nIt\u2019s good you\u2019ve helped her, but it\u2019s not \u2018adopted\u2019 if you\u2019ve only ever seen her in a strictly business capacity of watching your son. \n\nDo you have the funds to continue paying for her phone? Do you care about this girl as more than just a babysitting resource? She needs help, and she definitely needs the security of at least a phone number for safety, to call for help, transport, respond to jobs, etc. \n\nIf you\u2019re not in a position to take her to job interviews that\u2019s fine, but please consider throwing her a bone and not taking her phone away from her right now too.", "Yikes I mean her suroundings suck all around but in the end it isn't your responsibility,you payed for it in expectation of a Service you don't get it so you don't pay for it.NTA", "NTA", "NTA.. Her decision to move, look for a job, and get to and from it, and paying for her things, is her responsibility. She needs to understand that what you've been providing her has been out of the kindness of your heart, but is not forever.", "YWBTA. While she really isn\u2019t your responsibility, you made her feel safe and cared for. Even if it was a plainly business transaction for you, she\u2019s a kid and doesn\u2019t see it that way. She obviously has trouble with connections with the adults in her life and you became a replacement that it seems like she\u2019s having a hard time separating. Keeping the phone on until she is stable is the least you can do. Without it, she will have a harder time finding a job or getting around. \n\nHelp get write a good resume. If you have the time, help her get to interviews, even if it\u2019s by Uber or taxi. It seems like a lot but starting out at 17 after being ditched by the only person who seems to be stable in her life might be catastrophic to her. A deadline toward her having more independence wrong of you either.", "Going against the grain here. NTA. Not to mention that you commented that it is logistically impossible for you to drive her, 30 mins away is too big of an ask. You have a deal that she watches your kid and you pay her phone bill. Fair of you to stop that if she\u2019s not holding up her end. 17 is definitely better of enough to learn actions have consequences.", "Why do you consider it \u201ca pretty good deal\u201d that a 17 year old is paying $100 a month per rent, plus all her own food costs? Groceries for one are like $300 a month these days. On top of (presumably illegally) getting kicked out of her parents home, and living with her grandparents and a \u201chousemate\u201d? With her friend\u2019s aunt helping supplement phone and clothing costs?\n\nHonestly, YTA. I don\u2019t know what this kid has done, but if a 17 year old told me she was moving away that very night, my first and only thought would be concern. This sounds like a kid in crisis. This sounds like a kid desperately looking for any and all adults who might care about her. She\u2019s been thrown to the wolves, and while you\u2019ve been helping her, you seem to be viewing it as \u201ckind help for a fellow adult\u201d rather than \u201cnecessary care of a child.\u201d If she\u2019s moving that far away, is she even in school?!\n\nI don\u2019t blame you for not being able to continue helping this kid, but then you need to get social services involved, or some other form of support. A 17 year old shouldn\u2019t be in this situation, practically fighting for survival.", "I think YWBTA.\n\nI feel really sad for Lana. Noone in this story is giving her unconditional love. The help you gave her wasn't really help; it was in exchange for free babysitting. You were essentially paying her, just also dictating where that pay went. She hung out with you...whilst waiting to see if you needed help. I can't see where anyone is actually helping her figure out what she wants to do and how to get there. And she doesn't sound like a bad kid at all; if she was, you'd surely not trust her to babysit.\n\nI think its totally reasonable to say you can't drive her. Shutting off her phone...well, you don't owe her anything, but let's be honest, if that's your attitude you cannot call her an 'adopted kid'.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And a lot of other commenters echo it. I'm going to sit down and talk with her in a little while and try to figure out how I can give some more support that I can manage. And I won't turn off her service at least until she has a job and can pay it herself", "that's very valid. thank you so much. i'm definitely gonna try to work this out so she isnt screwed over", "This is what I was thinking too. The wording of the post made it seem like OP is mad she\u2019s losing easy access to her babysitter and that her care and support towards Lana was ALWAYS conditional. If ALL support was conditional OP should have made that clear from the get go, especially since everyone else has abandoned the poor girl. OP should have paid her wages and not gifted her items and taken care of her beyond that. She also shouldn\u2019t have let Lana come over when she wasn\u2019t actively working/babysitting in a proper arrangement. It caused major confusion. I don\u2019t think Lana should expect you to keep driving her around, but seeing how you have a history of helping give her lifts that aren\u2019t tied to payment for babysitting, I don\u2019t think calling in a favor is outside the realm of social norms or expectations. You have every right to let her know you can\u2019t anymore because the distance is too far for you now. You wouldn\u2019t be an AH for that. \n\nYou put \u201cadopted\u201d kid in your subject line. It sounds like you took Lana in and became her support because it convenienced you, but now that it doesn\u2019t you don\u2019t even want to do the bare minimum a friend would. You are more annoyed at losing your babysitter than what Lana is struggling with at home. YTA for that. Lana was entitled expecting you to still drive her. I can\u2019t tell if she asked you or if she just expected it, but maybe she simply didn\u2019t realize the new distance would make it difficult since she\u2019s only 17 and doesn\u2019t drive herself.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve seen your comments and am glad you are going to sit down with her and discuss things and help her out at least til she lands back on her feet. Maybe don\u2019t blur the lines with your next babysitter.", "Thank you. a lot of people are echoing this response so i'm going to see what resources I have to help her more instead of effectivly cutting her off at the knees", "Very true.

Why did they fire her from her job? Why did she move out from her grandparents' place?

It's a good time to have a calm supportive conversation with her letting her know that your limited time and money just can't support driving her to and from 30 minutes each way to look for a job and then drive her back and forth to said job. \n\nMaybe help her come up with a safe and feasible plan on how to accomplish her goals.

It definitely takes a decent person to help out a kid in need, and it sounds like you\u2019ve been there for her enough that she feels confident asking you for help, so obviously there\u2019s some closeness there. \n\nFrom your other comments it sounds like you were mostly surprised and hurt at how suddenly she\u2019s moving out. Teenagers are emotional, erratic and impulsive - you being upset shows that you do care about her, and maybe were reacting from a place of hurt that she\u2019d leave without talking to you first. Try to remember you\u2019re the only responsible adult in this scenario, and not take it personally that she\u2019s doing things that surprise or upset you.

This is a deeply unpleasant situation for her and your kindness is understandably something she was relying on as a stable adult in her life.  17 year olds often don't think things through that well and this type of sudden move makes a lot of sense in that regard.  She clearly wants to keep her relationship with you no matter that she's moving a little way away.  You're under no obligation to keep being as helpful and generous as you have been, but this girl clearly doesn't have anyone else in her life she can count on.  Cutting her off will probably do a lot of damage to her.  If you can afford to do so it would be far better to keep helping not just in the way you have been but in getting her thinking about the long term.  Finishing school, getting a decent job, being able to budget for everything she needs, she'll probably need some sort of welfare assistance for a while given the economic situation etc.  Basically teaching her what she needs so that she doesn't need your help long term.

She dyed her hair? She's 17? Kids do that but someone decided getting food from an aesthetically pleasing child was more important than that kid working. The only lesson that would have taught her is that if she does small harmless things that bring her joy adults will ruin her entire life.", "NTA (No longer the ah) This is my favorite type of post. I'm glad you're on a healthier path for both of you \u2764\ufe0f", "So how is OP an AH? Truly not her problem is Lana sees the relationship this way, she has no responsibility towards her just because of a perceived relationship. Literally no one's job to be the \"friend someone thinks they are\".", "INFO: Why are a minor's parents/grandparents charging her rent? They are legally obligated to provide for their child.", "ESH except for Lana who, frankly, is a minor who has no control over her circumstances. She should not be paying rent full stop. She\u2019s not your responsibility, but it does sound like you might have blurred lines with her quite a bit, and now she\u2019s confused about where she stands\u2014rightfully so.\n\nYou call her your adoptive child in the title, in quotes, but still, that came out of somewhere. Then you go on to describe her as a family friend/babysitter, so\u2026 which is it? If you\u2019ve blurred that line with her, I don\u2019t blame her for being confused. She\u2019s a child with no real family or support system, clinging to the one surrogate parental figure she has.", "Yes definitely make sure she\u2019s set up before cutting her off. She will be an adult living on her own now", "NTA only due to your edit.  You do need to rethink having someone with paranoid thoughts move in with your children in the future.  Grew up in that environment and it creates terrible instability and stress.  She could also become dangerous.", "This girl is 17.", "I appreciate so much that you came here for a reality check, listened to it, and are working with Lana to make sure she's taken care of and safe.", "Yuuup, they found someone so desperate and without support that they were able to screw over this kid very easily"]}
