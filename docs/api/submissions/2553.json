She babysits for you, you provide her food, clothes and a phone. As such, you feel perfectly justified taking these things away when she stops upholding her end. But it's also pretty obvious that Lana doesn't see your relationship the same way. She sees you as a source of support, maybe even friendship, and therefore feels comfortable asking you for a major favor in order to improve her living conditions.\n\nShe is asking too much from you obviously, but you also aren't the friend she thinks you are.", "ESH, but I\u2019m not sure Lana\u2019s so much an asshole for expecting you to drive her places as hopelessly naive given how thoroughly every single adult in her life seems to have let her down so far.  Why did her parents think it was appropriate to kick her out in the first place?  Why are her grandparents charging a 17 year old rent, much less expecting her to cover all her own expenses and not sticking up for her when even *that\u2019s* not enough for their asshole tenant?  And while, again, you don\u2019t need to drop everything to be her personal Uber driver, what good is your help if it stops the minute you\u2019re no longer getting anything out of the deal?  At least let her keep the phone long enough to line up a replacement.", "NTA try to break it to her gently.\n\nIf that is her decision then this is the cost.  Teaching teenagers decision making is a frustrating process, but you can do it without backing down at all.", "While Lana isn't your responsibility.\n\nIt's also clear that Lana isn't anyone's responsibility she's functionally an orphan.  Even if her family is still alive.\n\nIf you truly have no feelings for her as person, I feel at a minimum you should try and reach out to anyone who potentially would.  Before you cut off your support as well.", "YWBTA - where I'm taking issue here is that OP calls Lana her \"adopted\" kid in the title, but then describes her in terms that makes her sound more like just a babysitter who is getting paid in kind with food and clothes and a phone.  \n\n\nAt the very least, there's a bit of a disconnect here - OP wants to cut off Lana abruptly, which would make sense if Lana is just a babysitter who is abruptly moving away and abruptly cutting off services.  If Lana is just a babysitter, should she be paid in cash, not in-kind?  How much babysitting were we really talking about, and how did the in-kind payments stack up against what would have been the cash payments?  If, on the other hand, Lana is \\*not\\* just a babysitter, if she really is an \"adopted\" kid, then OP should have to roll with the punches a little bit - haul her out to her new place, and give her a grace period of a month before shutting off the phone, because that's the kind of thing you do for \"family\".", "YWBTA. Hey, this poor kid, dude. It sounds like she\u2019s kind of a mess right now, which at 17, with no parents helping her out, makes absolute sense. \nIt\u2019s good you\u2019ve helped her, but it\u2019s not \u2018adopted\u2019 if you\u2019ve only ever seen her in a strictly business capacity of watching your son. \n\nDo you have the funds to continue paying for her phone? Do you care about this girl as more than just a babysitting resource? She needs help, and she definitely needs the security of at least a phone number for safety, to call for help, transport, respond to jobs, etc. \n\nIf you\u2019re not in a position to take her to job interviews that\u2019s fine, but please consider throwing her a bone and not taking her phone away from her right now too.", "Yikes I mean her suroundings suck all around but in the end it isn't your responsibility,you payed for it in expectation of a Service you don't get it so you don't pay for it.NTA", "NTA", "NTA.. Her decision to move, look for a job, and get to and from it, and paying for her things, is her responsibility. She needs to understand that what you've been providing her has been out of the kindness of your heart, but is not forever.", "YWBTA. While she really isn\u2019t your responsibility, you made her feel safe and cared for. Even if it was a plainly business transaction for you, she\u2019s a kid and doesn\u2019t see it that way. She obviously has trouble with connections with the adults in her life and you became a replacement that it seems like she\u2019s having a hard time separating. Keeping the phone on until she is stable is the least you can do. Without it, she will have a harder time finding a job or getting around. \n\nHelp get write a good resume. If you have the time, help her get to interviews, even if it\u2019s by Uber or taxi. It seems like a lot but starting out at 17 after being ditched by the only person who seems to be stable in her life might be catastrophic to her. A deadline toward her having more independence wrong of you either.", "Going against the grain here. NTA. Not to mention that you commented that it is logistically impossible for you to drive her, 30 mins away is too big of an ask. You have a deal that she watches your kid and you pay her phone bill. Fair of you to stop that if she\u2019s not holding up her end. 17 is definitely better of enough to learn actions have consequences.", "Why do you consider it \u201ca pretty good deal\u201d that a 17 year old is paying $100 a month per rent, plus all her own food costs? Groceries for one are like $300 a month these days. On top of (presumably illegally) getting kicked out of her parents home, and living with her grandparents and a \u201chousemate\u201d? With her friend\u2019s aunt helping supplement phone and clothing costs?\n\nHonestly, YTA. I don\u2019t know what this kid has done, but if a 17 year old told me she was moving away that very night, my first and only thought would be concern. This sounds like a kid in crisis. This sounds like a kid desperately looking for any and all adults who might care about her. She\u2019s been thrown to the wolves, and while you\u2019ve been helping her, you seem to be viewing it as \u201ckind help for a fellow adult\u201d rather than \u201cnecessary care of a child.\u201d If she\u2019s moving that far away, is she even in school?!\n\nI don\u2019t blame you for not being able to continue helping this kid, but then you need to get social services involved, or some other form of support. A 17 year old shouldn\u2019t be in this situation, practically fighting for survival.", "I think YWBTA.\n\nI feel really sad for Lana. Noone in this story is giving her unconditional love. The help you gave her wasn't really help; it was in exchange for free babysitting. You were essentially paying her, just also dictating where that pay went. She hung out with you...whilst waiting to see if you needed help. I can't see where anyone is actually helping her figure out what she wants to do and how to get there. And she doesn't sound like a bad kid at all; if she was, you'd surely not trust her to babysit.\n\nI think its totally reasonable to say you can't drive her. Shutting off her phone...well, you don't owe her anything, but let's be honest, if that's your attitude you cannot call her an 'adopted kid'.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And a lot of other commenters echo it. I'm going to sit down and talk with her in a little while and try to figure out how I can give some more support that I can manage. And I won't turn off her service at least until she has a job and can pay it herself", "that's very valid. thank you so much. i'm definitely gonna try to work this out so she isnt screwed over", "This is what I was thinking too. The wording of the post made it seem like OP is mad she\u2019s losing easy access to her babysitter and that her care and support towards Lana was ALWAYS conditional. If ALL support was conditional OP should have made that clear from the get go, especially since everyone else has abandoned the poor girl. OP should have paid her wages and not gifted her items and taken care of her beyond that. She also shouldn\u2019t have let Lana come over when she wasn\u2019t actively working/babysitting in a proper arrangement. It caused major confusion. I don\u2019t think Lana should expect you to keep driving her around, but seeing how you have a history of helping give her lifts that aren\u2019t tied to payment for babysitting, I don\u2019t think calling in a favor is outside the realm of social norms or expectations. You have every right to let her know you can\u2019t anymore because the distance is too far for you now. You wouldn\u2019t be an AH for that. \n\nYou put \u201cadopted\u201d kid in your subject line. It sounds like you took Lana in and became her support because it convenienced you, but now that it doesn\u2019t you don\u2019t even want to do the bare minimum a friend would. You are more annoyed at losing your babysitter than what Lana is struggling with at home. YTA for that. Lana was entitled expecting you to still drive her. I can\u2019t tell if she asked you or if she just expected it, but maybe she simply didn\u2019t realize the new distance would make it difficult since she\u2019s only 17 and doesn\u2019t drive herself.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve seen your comments and am glad you are going to sit down with her and discuss things and help her out at least til she lands back on her feet. Maybe don\u2019t blur the lines with your next babysitter.", "Thank you. a lot of people are echoing this response so i'm going to see what resources I have to help her more instead of effectivly cutting her off at the knees", "Very true. I'm planning on sitting down with her today and making a plan on how I can best support her from half an hour away. Including keeping her phone on until she has an established job and at least one paycheck in her account", "my husband and i did try to offer guidance but she very much refused it. in the end she set the terms for everything. we just gratefully accepted the help in exchange for buying what she wanted or needed.", "You sound like a good person, OP\n\nI cannot imagine how stressful it must be fore a teen to feel so u welcome and unwanted by her own family\u2026 she probably told you at the last minute because that\u2019s a coping mechanism of sorts for her. \n\nJust continue to help her as you can and are able, you\u2019ll probably be that one person she remembers as she gets older who cared.", "Why did she drop out? Why did they fire her from her job? Why did she move out from her grandparents' place? What was her housemate talking about when they called her crappy no good?\n\nI think Lana has many issues and she probably needs help with them... but still, she can't expect you to act like her mother. She isn't your kid. NTA", "NTA and it seems that you already have a good idea of what to do. It's a good time to have a calm supportive conversation with her letting her know that your limited time and money just can't support driving her to and from 30 minutes each way to look for a job and then drive her back and forth to said job. \n\nMaybe help her come up with a safe and feasible plan on how to accomplish her goals. And it would be very kind of you to keep her phone on to ensure that she is safe well trying to get herself and more independent life at such a young age on her own. Good luck Opie I hope you both have a good outcome.", "I\u2019m really glad you\u2019ve said this. It definitely takes a decent person to help out a kid in need, and it sounds like you\u2019ve been there for her enough that she feels confident asking you for help, so obviously there\u2019s some closeness there. \n\nFrom your other comments it sounds like you were mostly surprised and hurt at how suddenly she\u2019s moving out. Teenagers are emotional, erratic and impulsive - you being upset shows that you do care about her, and maybe were reacting from a place of hurt that she\u2019d leave without talking to you first. Try to remember you\u2019re the only responsible adult in this scenario, and not take it personally that she\u2019s doing things that surprise or upset you. She doesn\u2019t have a great roadmap of how to act from her parents. You showing that you care where she goes and what happens to her will probably go along way. \n\nGood for you OP, best of luck.", "You\u2019re a good person!
