Even if you think you're just \"backing her up\" you're not, you haven't solved the issue of DIL needing to apologize, or having an adult conversation about ONE unspecified \"negative\" comment that was years ago (again according to you) and your daughter is holding a grudge, you're just...enabling an AH without solving the issue.", "YTA, both you and your daughter. What if your DIL had actually eaten some of her food? How serious her allergy is?

Also, if she really cared about dinner she would have said something the first night or even before dinner was being made. She now just wants someone to cater to her. She's a grown ass woman who is almost 40. She can definitely cook for herself and her husband too. I also love how the daughter responded to being yelled at by her SIL. Like seriously. She's 16. They have attitude. It's expected. I don't think she's the ah here as she did what any teenager who is being mistreated does. Tell your DIL to apologize sincerely and to never insult her again and then maybe work on getting the 16 year old to cook for everyone if you still want her in the kitchen. You do have more house guests though that aren't the 16 year olds fault so maybe people can take turns making dinner from now on and she can take the garabage out or something to 'make up for it'.", "Pettiness at it's finest, clearly your daughter knows how to stand up for herself.

Sometimes, it means that we have to honor those boundaries as well, even if it makes more work for us. \n\nOps daughters boundary is obviously that she doesn't want to cook for someone who is mean to her. A valid healthy boundary. \n\nSo then it's Ops job to either remove their daughter from the equation or correct the conflict that exist between his daughter and DIL.  This could be done in several ways. \n\nOps daughter could only cook for the three of them as before and the DIL and Son are responsible for their own meals.

Why don\u2019t **you** like your DIL?", "Well we know where the daughter got her petty and vengeful attitude from.  Apple doesn't fall far from the tree. You seriously think petty and vengeful is cute.  It's not cute in a person, when she will do it in a workplace, etc.  Parenting is a verb, not a noun.", "So yes you do not see the problem. Most people agree that intentional exclusionary behaviour is a d*ck move.", "Being 16 doesn\u2019t prevent others from pointing out shitty petty behavior.

We\u2019re all blaming OP her for encouraging petty behaviour but most likely the daughter is only petty with DIL because she made a sexist comment towards her.

Idc how petty my kid is being, this is his home and his safe place and if I need to handle his behavior or a situation, that\u2019s fine.

OP is fanning the flames here instead of stepping in as an adult. The 16 year old is wrong but she\u2019s also young, that\u2019s why I blamed OP for not teaching her better in my original post.

Just sitting back and watching two family members go at each other like a tennis match is intentional behavior imo.", "Well each to their own but I wouldn't be as proud as you would be to have two family members acting like this, and I'm very glad to say my family don't let each other treat each other this way.", "The point is that daughter is not obligated to make meals for a person who antagonized her 2 years ago (ie 35 year old DIL antagonizing a 14 year old girl) who apparently never tried to make things right.", "Maybe DIL could finally apologize and then she'd get chef service accommodating her allergy.", "She chose the chore when it wasn't for 5 people, including one who apparently isnt very good to her.", "For being an ass first and commenting on a 16 old girl choosing to wear masculine clothes.", "It seems no one has an issue with not cooking.  They just want the minor to run a restaurant.  The main problem that\u2019s not being addressed is the contention between the minor and the DIL.  They only see the minor being rude for being passive/aggressive.  What should be done is designate someone else to cook dinner and have a discussion with the DIL about how she treats the minor.  It\u2019s probably the only way the minor can get back at DIL for being a bully.  Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right but things need to change for everyone involved.

Op shouldn't be enforcing that: although she is not obligated to cook for DIL, this should be communicated to her and not doing this in this petty, exclusionary and dangerous way. Op should be stopping petty behavior and letting expectations about who is expect to cook to who instead of letting this girl try to poison her SIL everyday. This might cost a allergic reaction, a trip to ER and a huge fallout.", "Yeah I agree. The wrong part is that he is letting pettiness run in the house. No one is acting like an adult. She is not wrong to not want to cook for someone she despises, but he should enforce this the right way communicating the other party that she is going to cook for 3 people and they have to fend themselves. \nWhen pettiness cost a trip of DIL to the ER and huge fallout maybe he and the daughter will learn the worst way.", "I mean they are almost 40 and girl is 16... she shouldn't be responsible to feed them. She was not found of DIL and since she is a minor she had no say in living with them...so I think people are not seeing this is an adult feuding with a teenager about something that shouldn't be a problem at all because they are living with OP as a favor, this is already very kind.", "Does the dil even know that this is why she's being excluded?

Over and over? Sorry, that\u2019s teenage asshole behavior.", "Yesz OP mentioned in the comments that DIL knows.  DIL sounds like a real peach:\n\n> she snapped at my daughter and asked her how many fcking meals she can cook that have milk in them.\n\nGiven that this is how she reacts, she sounds rather unpleasant on the whole, and this likely just the tip of the iceberg for how she is toward daughter.\n\nShe's 37.  She doesn't appear to act like much of an adult.  16 year old has an excuse.", "Maybe.  But OP mentioned in the comments that DIL thinks daughter just needs to get over it.", "If you're going insult me, refuse to apologize, and insist I'm wrong because I'm the one who needs to get over it, why the hell would I accommodate you? If DIL has a problem with this, she's free to find someplace else to live rent free where she can insist that someone else's teenage daughter cook for her. Or she can take her own advice and get over it."]}
