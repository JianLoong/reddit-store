Good parenting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I don't know who raised you OP but I'd like to understand why they raised you to think that not liking your chore or a person means you can try and hurt someone, based on your edit. Either your daughter is cooking for the \"family\" or she's not, but you need to pick one and if your DIL AND your son need to cook their own meals, make that be the arrangement, stop supporting your child's malicious behaviour. Even if you think you're just \"backing her up\" you're not, you haven't solved the issue of DIL needing to apologize, or having an adult conversation about ONE unspecified \"negative\" comment that was years ago (again according to you) and your daughter is holding a grudge, you're just...enabling an AH without solving the issue.", "YTA, both you and your daughter. What if your DIL had actually eaten some of her food? How serious her allergy is? Are you sure you would have enjoyed hearing her throw up all night or end up in hospital?\n\nI understand your daughter is a teenager and they can be really annoying.

Also, if she really cared about dinner she would have said something the first night or even before dinner was being made. She now just wants someone to cater to her. She's a grown ass woman who is almost 40. She can definitely cook for herself and her husband too. I also love how the daughter responded to being yelled at by her SIL. Like seriously. She's 16. They have attitude. It's expected. I don't think she's the ah here as she did what any teenager who is being mistreated does. Tell your DIL to apologize sincerely and to never insult her again and then maybe work on getting the 16 year old to cook for everyone if you still want her in the kitchen. You do have more house guests though that aren't the 16 year olds fault so maybe people can take turns making dinner from now on and she can take the garabage out or something to 'make up for it'.", "Pettiness at it's finest, clearly your daughter knows how to stand up for herself.

One day your son and DIL might have kids and  no sane mother would trust their child into the hands of people who are condoning such behavior (for all we know next time your daughter might target her niece/nephew).

Finally, of course your daughtet isn't obliged to cook for everyone and of course your DIL can and should start cooking for herself and her husband. But where will that leave your family?

Making the DIL apologize and setting boundaries prior to allowing them to move back in would have gone a long way as well. \n\nHis daughter would have felt heard and the DIL would know to respect her autonomy. \n\nHaving failed there, taking that chore away from his child so she is not forced to deal with catering to very real needs of someone she dislikes would have been even better. \n\nOur job as parents is to teach our children healthy boundaries and communication. Sometimes, it means that we have to honor those boundaries as well, even if it makes more work for us. \n\nOps daughters boundary is obviously that she doesn't want to cook for someone who is mean to her. A valid healthy boundary. \n\nSo then it's Ops job to either remove their daughter from the equation or correct the conflict that exist between his daughter and DIL.  This could be done in several ways. \n\nOps daughter could only cook for the three of them as before and the DIL and Son are responsible for their own meals.

But you specifically said that this is her CHORE.  If that's her CHORE, then she should be doing correctly.  And correctly would be to make something everyone can eat.  \n\nYou're allowing her to be spiteful, and even making excuses for it.  It seems that you approve of it.

Her brother clearly thinks it's okay for his wife to be nasty to her, since she was allowed to make comments. If her comments are really upsetting her, she may feel bullied dil, and she's suppose to cook for her for 6-8 months? I'd guess her approach is to make her cook for herself.

When I lived with my mother as an adult who couldn't have dairy, I made my own food because milk is in everyfuckingthing out there.  Now, with my own kids, I cook dinner in a way that I can eat.
