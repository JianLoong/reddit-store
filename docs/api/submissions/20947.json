It's also quite immature to get so worked up about a pair of socks that you end a party early because of it.

As for you giving the gift to your dog, I feel like thats not a problem but it is understandable that he got mad since you clearly reacted poorly about the gift in the first place. To him, it probably looks like you're just ungrateful which ultimately makes you TA in this situation.", "I know this will get a lot of downvotes as the majority think socks are a bad/thoughtless gift, BUT I disagree. I\u2019m likely quite a bit older than you and want for nothing. I don\u2019t like attention or gifts. Whatever i need or want, i can buy myself. I had some family, who spends most of their lives on the road, stop by for Christmas one year. They gave me a bag full of gifts (something I wasn\u2019t expecting). My idea of a good holiday is cooking and eating together & catching up on life. Anyway, the *only* thing I remember from that gift is a pair of socks. Those warm, insulated, fuzzy socks with grips on the bottom. Years later, I still love them. They\u2019ve finally started to wear thin and I\u2019ll soon be searching for another pair.

Like I gave my ex more thoughtful gift in a month anniversary when I was 14. Socks seem like you don't give much much thought on the gift.

Surely, he can get a better gift.\n\n\nYou shouldn't expect the kind of gifts he gives to his family. 5 months is a pretty long time to know what to give you, but not long enough to give expensive gifts.

I understand if he doesn't want to spend much, but he could have gotten a better gift with the same price.\n\n\nGiving the socks away to the dog as chew toy is the asshole move. Sure, you hate the gift. It is also said that you have a phobia? I don't know how that works, but you should have told him you can't accept the gift due to the phobia if your phobia is very serious. If it is not very serious, you should have given it away or sold it. And tell him that you don't like socks so you give it away. But talking out is more recommended. \n\nBoth of you suck.

Hell my dad even went on holiday to Spain about four years ago told me he was going to get me something and asked my shoe size.
