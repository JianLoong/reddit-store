My birthday is really special to me and is one of the things I always look forward to.  Particularly my boyfriends.\n\nSo at the party, I was opening gifts, and I eventually got to my boyfriend\u2019s. When I opened it, it was socks with holes. I got upset because it was not only socks but they also had a holes pattern on them. I have extreme trypophobia, so it really freaked me out. \n\nMy boyfriend got upset because I didn\u2019t give the reactions he was expecting. I told him before that I have trypophobia. He was so really well-off, so it\u2019s really insulting he got me socks for my birthday when he got expensive jewelry for his mom, sister, and grandma. Not even for special occasions.\n\nI was so upset I ended the party early. When we came up, I balled up the socks and gave them to my dog as a chew toy to play with. So it won\u2019t go to waste. Later, when he saw my dog messing with the socks, he got angry and yelled at me that I was misusing his gift. He told me that I should be grateful. \n\nI told him that he\u2019s given his family members expensive or well-thought-out presents for just normal days like it was nothing and that he\u2019s an asshole for not even putting half of the thought he did for me into them.\n\nI talked to my brother about this, and he told me that maybe my boyfriend doesn\u2019t believe we are as far into the relationship to give me items as he does to his family.\n\nAITA?\n\n[EDIT: I am addressing some questions even though I am not required to. \n1. If people actually focused on other comments instead of my polka-dot ones, they would know that I've mentioned that he has given his exes that he has dated for less amounts of time than me expensive items, or well-thought-out gifts. \n2. My family is well-off. I don't need his expensive gifts. I love flowers, and he knows I love flowers. A flower in a pot would have been enough. \n3. What does my username have to do with it?? My nickname is Pearl. The gems part just went well with it. \n4. Just because YOU have trypophobia as well, and it doesn't trigger you, doesn't mean it can't trigger me. Don't invalidate my experience just because they don't apply to you. \n5. There's this one commenter that seems to have it out for me. I know I shouldn't feed the attention trolls. You can try to invalidate this all you want.

And even if he didn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t even give an acquaintance socks because that a shitty ass gift, from anyone, it literally shows that they don\u2019t care about your birthday and that they only got you a gift because they had to, OP is absolutely NTA!", "But, your opinion that they are vastly different doesn't matter, what matters is if the pattern triggers the phobia.  We've all thought we saw something that freaked us out, only to get closer and realize it was something different.  Like thinking a person is waiting in teh shadows, and then you realize it was a post or shrub.\n\nIf their brain reads the pattern as holes initially, it's a legit issue.\n\nBeing pissy about getting socks, and expecting the BF to instinctively know polka dot are a trigger, though, is totally unreasonable.\n\nOP is TA", "I never expect gifts, but I\u2019m always happiest with something thought was put into! I would much rather have a $5 thing that you think I would really enjoy vs a $500 thing that no thought went into.", "My birthday is really special to me. Which is why I make a point of making it special for myself. I don\u2019t expect it to be special to anyone else.", "Even flowers would be a better gift. Something so simple and not expensive, but it is clearly more thoughtful and genuine. I would be upset about receiving socks as well.", "I disagree. I love getting socks in my stocking and always gift nice ones to my SO. It\u2019s a symbol of taking care of them. But it\u2019s not the only gift. And if it was, I\u2019d understand that the gifter probably had financial issues and couldn\u2019t afford more and in which case it\u2019s still nice to get a gift. \n\nNot the same in OPs situation, it sounds like they feel like it was last minute. But socks in general aren\u2019t a bad gift", "Aw my partner gets me socks for holidays for the same reason!! :\u2019)", "The older you get, the more you appreciate getting socks and underwear as gifts.", "My husband loves getting funky socks. His parents and even my family members give him socks every Christmas because it's the only gift (other than fireworks) he will always be excited for. I usually give him socks for holidays...along with another gift. I couldn't fathom getting someone, let alone my partner only socks for their birthday, especially if I were wealthy.\n\nBut she definitely blew it out of proportion.", "Yeah, I always give my best friend socks, but that's because they love funny/cute socks and have a collection of them. In this case it sounds like that doesn't apply.", "Yeah lol, we got my father Bombas for Christmas a couple years ago and earlier this month he started talking about how much he liked them. So I asked if that was a hint and he said yes \ud83d\ude06. Guess who got two new pairs for Father's Day?", "I cant believe how many people are badmouthing socks! They're a great gift especially if someone gets you a nice pair of bombas or other comfy brand. And they have fun patterns! \n\nI had a friend gift me a pair of really nice socks with dinosaurs on them, I still use them more then and other gift from that birthday.", "Socks are great! I have boring ones\u2026. The problem\nIs I couldn\u2019t be bothered to by new socks for my feet (normally that happens when they get holes.) I recently saw these great looking pair of penguin socks! Hey, new socks wouldn\u2019t be to bad right now wouldn\u2019t it!", "I cant believe how many people are badmouthing socks! They're a great gift especially if someone gets you a nice pair of bombas or other comfy brand.

I love socks. But I hate getting them from people unless it's my husband. Why? Texture and type of sock hugely matter to me. Same for my husband. He loves getting novelty boxers. He's very picky with what he wears. \n\nUnless someone has specifically asked for something don't go with one of the lamest gifts ever that will only sit in the closet collecting dust until someone donates them.", "Yeah socks seems pretty impersonal. I wouldn't call it a deal breaker but it would keep me in mind for the future. My bf and I just started dating 2 weeks before christmas; I baked him apple/berry turnovers as his gift and he thought it was so personal and special. And he got me a gift card to buy a bunch of new bras because I had just gotten a breast reduction and needed new ones.", "NTA. 5 months is a long enough relationship to warrant something better than socks. Even in a brand new relationship, socks would be a terrible gift unless the recipient really likes/needs socks. The gift doesn\u2019t need to be expensive, but some actual thoughtfulness is rightfully expected from a romantic partner. Socks are pretty [universally looked upon as a bad gift](https://nznaturalclothingshop.co.nz/our-blog/are-socks-a-bad-gift/) unless one of the following three situations applies:\n\n1. The recipient has an obvious need for socks.\n2. The recipient has an obvious love for socks.\n3. You\u2019re participating in a gag gift exchange. \n\nOutside of these situations, socks are the kind of gift that you give someone who you don\u2019t like when social pressure forces you to provide a gift. \n\nThis BF\u2018s overall lack of effort seems to make him unworthy of your further effort. It\u2019s not even worth fighting over. I\u2019d just cut my losses and leave.", "Your boyfriend clearly isn\u2019t on a mission to impress you in the early stages of your relationship. Trust me when I say that it won\u2019t get any better later on. There\u2019s a fine line between a cheap ass pair of socks and a meaningful gift. He obviously DGAF about any of your interests. Is it really that hard to ask someone\u2019s style or fandom and get them something on Amazon for that? Nooooope. Real talk, it sounds like he\u2019s a regifter or an afterthoughter. What kinda guy picks out polka dot socks for a woman???? Nah, that was a stocking stuffer left over or a bad bday gift someone in his family got. Either way, he\u2019s cheap. Cheap men never get better, so if that bothers you (and oh it will down the road when they moan about even splitting anything over $50 with you), I suggest you cut and run now before he ruins more occasions and then vacations. I\u2019ve lived it. They spend money on themselves and their family/friends\u2026 and no matter how much time/money/effort you put into them/their gift/their birthday they\u2019re not going to reciprocate for you. Not even when you tell them how it hurts you. I planned my ex\u2019s entire birthday party, bought him a killer gift, invited all his friends, bought and made food\u2026 my birthday 11 months later? The cheap jerk didn\u2019t even get me a gift, let alone offer to plan mine. And he was a event planner for his job! \ud83d\ude11 Couldn\u2019t bothered for me. But ohhhh, he helped plan his friend\u2019s birthday bash trip to Disney and chipped in money for them. You see what I mean? If you aren\u2019t getting treated the way other important people in his life are treated\u2026 bail. You know you deserve better. Be up front about that now and if he doesn\u2019t agree, that\u2019s your sign.", "NTA \n\nyour reaction was over the top bad, but I've been in a relationship with a partner who repeatedly got me nothing or super low effort gifts for my birthday/christmas and what everyone seems to be missing is that it makes you feel shit, not because you didn't get anything good, but because it shows what they think you're worth. \n\nBeing shown, through actions, that you're not worth the time, money, or effort to get a gift for a special occasion really drags down your self worth.\n\nI imagine it'd be much worse if they routinely gave others great gifts.\n\nYour going to need to articulate that better than \"socks are cheap, you get your family jewellery\" though.", "NTA like seriously a sock? Like what? Bro it\u2019s someone\u2019s birthday it\u2019s important and especially if it your gf but a sock? Like you don\u2019t have to go all out but at least do better it just looks like he forgot it was your birthday ran down to the nearest store and said \u201csocks wouldn\u2019t be so bad of a present?\u201d \n\nAlso wtf would he get so mad about acting like he gave her $300 socks. Like bro do better, also just cause you guys don\u2019t care what you get in your birthday\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the same for other people some people take it seriously and the bare minimum you can do is put effort into the gift you\u2019re giving", "Temper tantrum. OP has main character syndrome.", "I mean.... It depends. Maybe it was relevant to one of their dates but OP didn't remember/acknowledge it.", "Some people find fun socks to be a good gift dude.

I feel the way about bath bombs that you do about socks. I adore fun socks! I hate baths because tubs aren\u2019t long enough nor deep enough for me. Some parts are always sticking out of the water getting cold!", "ESH, but op more than bf. He had no idea that polka dots freaked you out and there's no way he could have or should have known that. For fucks sake. \n\n\nSocks aren't a great gift, but come on do you really expect anyone to believe that you truly thought they would make a great chew toy? Be honest, you knew that was horribly rude and that's why you did it. So fucking passive aggressive. Y'all need to just go your separate ways sooner rather than later.", "Usually when a guy pushes boundaries to test how poorly he can treat his partner, he is considered the asshole.\n\nSocks were in this instance, a really short gift that showed what he thought she was worth. And it's not just about them not being expensive.", "A test after 5 months of dating? Maybe I\u2019m crazy but you\u2019d think he\u2019d be able to tell her character much earlier on.

Who gifts their gf ONE pair of socks?! My crazy Grandma gave me better gifts than that. I was also afraid of her.", "Oh, lord. Sure, that's the first thing anyone would think of! /s", "I remember that post. This whole tone was crap, like nothing she could have done was right. I voted YTA, not because of him not wanting or tossing the gifts but his whole attitude. It was a lot like this OP's without the price tag.", "That one was insane. The whole sub went into a rage about how he should consider her feelings, on *his* own birthday", "\"when in doubt, blame the penis\" is this sub's motto.", "You only go to maccys for dates if you're teenagers.\n\nThe first few dates I had with my now-husband were at a local coffee shop halfway between where we both lived. Chatting over coffee and cake is a great first date - low pressure, low expectation, reasonable cost. Maccys dinner date as an adult is just... Wow. That being said, there is something fun about nabbing a drive thru and having an impromptu picnic though. But not as a first date.", "A few days ago a bunch of people criticised a man for not giving his SAH wife more free time. That man worked full time, did all the cooking, did all the cleaning and got his daughter ready for school. All the wife did was look after the kid after she came home from school. \n\nThe man got 1 date night per month and a single 3 hour walk per month while she got an 8 hour break 5 days a week. And somehow they expected him to get his wife more free time or plan a spa get away for her because she was burned out. \n\nNo idea what she was burned out from. The man did everything.", "We are all assuming he meant to be thoughtful with the socks? Sounds like a passive aggressive way of letting her know he\u2019s not that into her. Or at least could be that.", "Like if someone did that kind of test on me, I would be furious and dump them anyway. A pair of polka dot socks shows no thought.  I get more than a pair of socks for people I'm not sleeping with.  Surely girlfriend has an interest where he could spend less than $50 to get her something that would make her laugh or smile.   Like she is saying he gets his family nice jewelry and he got her polka dot socks.  There is space between polka dot socks and jewelry.  That space is occupied by books she would like, nice candles,  a small perfume, and some sort of gift card to a store she loves.", "who tf \"tests\" their partners if not for heavily insecure reasons?

That being said, one of my favorite gifts my husband ever got me was a pair of socks with our dog\u2019s face on them.", "Yep, this is exactly why she's TA. Also because she gave her dog socks to chew and they can literally swallow socks and die because of it.", "Maybe he asks?", "As an add on to Christmas gifts or something", "Yeah, I love getting soft, fuzzy socks for Christmas. This was a birthday gift. They\u2019ve been together for 5 months. A gift card would have been more effort than socks.", "Very few people would be excited about getting socks. If op or someone like yourself talked about loving fun socks, then it would be a good gift. Others, always no for a solo gift for a romantic partner. I would have said thanks and stuck them in my draw. Op big reaction makes her a bit of an AH. But I feel for most people socks would be a bummer. Like you didn\u2019t want to put any thought into a gift and grabbed a pair of socks\u2026"]}
