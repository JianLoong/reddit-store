They're asking the more reasonable and mature one to be a doormat because they want something. \n\nEither there's a whole host of missing background, or your brother either is totally under his wife's control or he's just not a good person.

Your NTA when it comes to you and your brother but you could be YTA when it comes to your parents. \n\nI\u2019m watching this play out in my aunts family right now. They all had a petty spat over various separate little things and they were not talking to each other. As a result they never really come to family gatherings. I have never really seen there children, there houses or much else. They have effectively destroyed their relationship with the greater family because they never come out to anything anymore no matter how big the group is.\n\nAnd that doesn\u2019t get into how there parents feel. They are stressed and feel shame that their children are behaving in such a way that the parents have gone to counseling to deal with their sadness over the issue.\n\nMy uncle had cancer and they wouldn\u2019t even show up together to help. \n\nSo here is what I am saying. Don\u2019t forgive. That takes an effort between two parties but that can\u2019t happen if the parties never see each other again. But please put some effort in for your parents.

It sounds like your brother might have already had some issues with you and this is a convenient excuse. Maybe he resented his parents having another child when he was 13. Then he resented you telling off his child. I think you were totally fair to tell off his child as she was in danger of hurting herself and destroying your cat furniture. I'm not sure that you apologising would make your brother start acknowledging you, I think he has deeper issues.", "Nope, your family needs to supervise their kids.  Period.", "They want you to be doormat for life to have access to grandkids. If you're still living with them, why didn't they tell 9 to get down?", "Info - this isnt adding up? You asked the kids to not climb on cat furniture and they stormed off and its now created a huge rift? Over, cat furniture?", "We're living abroad, so in person it's only us and them. I just don't come along when the parents visit them", "I have never yelled at their kids, not even once, because I'm a very quiet person. Heck, I wasn't even annoyed or angry. My niece is unfortunately that type of kid that throws tantrums several times a day and her mother always gives in to whatever she wants. Among other, I got accused of \"mishandling her child, my closest family, by not letting her play freely\"", "Really? A 9 year old knows better than to climb on cat furniture. And if the kid cries over being asked to get off said furniture, they have figured out how to get their way. If that had been my kid, I would have packed him up and left out of embarrassment, not because someone asked him to get off something he shouldn't have been on. And by the way, no child ever died from being yelled at. You sound like one of these people nowadays who is all bent out of shape about being all warm fuzzies with kids because we don't want to damage their little psyches. Kids need to learn how to handle rules, boundaries, manners, disappointment, failure,.....all the things that adults have to handle. When they don't learn this things as kids, we have adults who can't function.", "I'm 22, and yes.\n\nThey're not missing out.

The shitstorm it caused...), the older recently called my mother and demanded I leave the house so she can come over and play with the cat - who am I supposed to talk to?", "Thanks. Personally I think his wife is one of the issues - for 11 years she pretended to be a good friend of mine just to then write she actually never even liked and couldn't stand me \ud83d\ude02 my brother does every single thing she wants, so it would explain some things", "Because the kids parents were there, and it's their beloved granddaughter...", "I guess you've somehow missed the latest parenting craze: yelling at people for \"parenting\" their child.\n\nExamples:\n\nTelling a kid to stop running around the pool.\n\nTelling a kid to stop running with scissors.\n\nTelling a kid to stop screaming and jumping on your furniture. \n\nTelling a kid to stop trying to ride on your dog's back.\n\nTelling a kid to stop tormenting your cat.\n\nYelling at a kid for breaking into the locked upstairs room your parrots are in because they want to mess with your birds.\n\nI've read each of these stories on AITA. And the parents not only act like no one is allowed to tell their children no, they act like it's *offensive* for someone to tell their child no.\n\nEdited to add: there's a difference between screaming abuse, and yelling \"what are you doing, get out of here and leave them alone\". Screaming abuse is not ok. Raising your voice in startlement or justified anger, in a non-abusive way, is in my view understandable.", "Yep. My SIL glorifies that older kid, and according to her, I mishandled my closest family by not letting her play freely", "So that means you're allowed to freely watch her as she injures herself.

Every time he's told anything or doesn't get his way, he instantly screams, cries, slams doors etc, talks back. So as much as I'd like to think parents are doing their job as parents, I've seen first hand a nine year old acting terribly. It takes us a week to get our child to stop acting like a little shit after he sees his cousin. We have limited their visits but my son loves his cousin and wants to see him. So I believe this could be happening with this nine year old. Should she know better? Yup. But that doesn't mean she cares.", "Ok, in fairness, I will acknowledge I misread it.  I thought it said a 2 and 5 year old.   \n\nThat does kind of change things for me.  \n\nAnd let me be clear, I have no problem with yelling at a kid on occasion.   I just try to not yell at other people's children myself, unless I'm babysitting them or something.
