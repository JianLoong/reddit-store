I wore a few pieces during my master\u2019s graduation last year and my mum kept oohing and aahing over them. She kept going on about how beautiful I looked in them and how she also loved wearing them. \n\nMy little sister was there as well. I saw her last week and she asked me whether I could lend her some pieces to wear during her graduation (she\u2019s in her final year of uni) because she felt really left out at my graduation. \n\nI said I\u2019d ask my dad. He said no. My sister is upset because most of the pieces are in my possession so she doesn\u2019t get why I can\u2019t just sneak her a few pieces to wear without my dad knowing. Then I made a comment about how I didn\u2019t wanna break my dad\u2019s trust, which she took as me insulting her relationship with her dad (my sister and stepfather have a rough relationship to say the least).

And you talking about not wanting to break your dad\u2019s trust has nothing to do with her relationship with her dad.\n\nIf you would normally get her a gift for something like this, perhaps you could offer to take her shopping for some nice jewellery for the event as your gift. You\u2019re under no obligation to, of course - just an idea.", "NTA, she needs to learn that she can't have everything she wants and needs to be able to respect boundaries. If you gave her the jewellery in secret, eventually the truth would come out and heated confrontations would occur between your family, it's not worth it. Also don't let her manipulate your relationship based on whether you give her the jewels or not, it's completely unreasonable and she should be ashamed for doing so. If she continues to pressure you about the heirlooms, set boundaries between you and her for the time being until she decides to be more mature.", "NTA. You are not obliged to loan your jewelry to her, nor to not wear it around her so she doesn't feel bad. These are her issues (and your mum's too), not your responsibility. \n\nI mean, don't rub it in her face or anything, but wearing the pieces is fine!", "NTA - the jewelry is a heirloom from your dad, not hers.  I understand her feeling sort of left out, but you are honoring your dad's wishes.  Do you have any non-heirloom jewelry you could lend her to wear during her graduation service?", "NTA.\n\nAnd I'm not sure why your sister would be interested in wearing any of it considering it's history with your father - someone she's not related to.  \n\nMy only suggestion would be for you and your Mum to buy her something that she can wear and keep which I think would have more sentimental value for her.", "NTA \n\nShe's trying to guilt trip you into doing something that will surely ruin your relationship with your dad. Which is very malicious behaviour.\n\nPLUS!\n\nEven if your mum wore them during her marriage to your dad, they are heirlooms from your dad's side of the family. Your stepsister isn't blood related to your dad, so I don't get her reasoning to claim it \"unfair\" that she doesn't get to wear them. She's not entitled to them.\n\nALSO\n\nShe's too jealous of  your relationship with your dad and of course the jewellery; so, you should be really vigilant about them in the future, they might go missing around her", "NTA.\n\nDon't let her make HER problem(s) YOUR problem(s), please?", "NTA, it\u2019s your father heirlooms which yes you have in your possession but he can always take them away since legally they are his as per divorce agreement. Why don\u2019t you and your mum pool a little bit of money and buy her her own heirloom so she can start her own tradition?", "NTA. Pictures will be taken, your dad will likely see them and he would rightfully feel betrayed. Don't budge, you are not the asshole at all", "NTA, she\u2019s acting like a toddler", "NTA. The jewelry clearly means a lot to your dad if he took it back after the divorce. Your sister, who isn\u2019t related to him, has no business throwing a fit over not being loaned jewelry that belongs to him. (And it is up to him who can borrow it, if he hasn\u2019t actually given it to you.)\n\nYour relationship with your dad has nothing to do with anyone else\u2019s relationships with their parents. She\u2019s just trying to come up with manipulation tactics and that one is a hell of a stretch. She isn\u2019t exactly painting herself as someone you should loan expensive heirlooms to.", "NTA.  Your sister might lose the items or break them.  Then you'd have to explain to your dad why they were in his stepdaughter's possession.  Your dad would find out that she wore the jewelry when pictures of her wearing it would get posted to social media.  Keep wearing it in front of her.\n\nAlso:\n\n>because she felt really left out at my graduation.\n\nWhat the hell?!  Your graduation was about you and only you.  She's kind of entitled to want to be included at an event celebrating your accomplishment.", "NTA the solution is don\u2019t invite her to big events you are wearing the jewellery to. When she complains about that, you can say clearly you are just following her wishes.", "NTA \n\nShe asked, you said no ,the end . It's nice to share with siblings but you don't always have to do that . If something is given to you alone it's upto you whether you want to share or not .", "No is a complete sentence.
