She used it against you because of her relationship with her dad! She knew exactly what you were saying! She's desperately acting out to do anything she can to get her way...

Your post reads like she has some expectation of ownership someday.\n\n Also, your dad will find out and lose trust in you.  There will be photos, a piece will be lost, your dad will be at the event as well, etc.  Your half-sister or mother may even inform him themselves if their relationship is hostile and they want to irritate him.  \n\nPerhaps I have read too many stories here, but I would take all the family heirlooms and put them away someplace safe.  This means a safe deposit box or physical safe, not the bottom of your sock drawer.  Reddit has enough stories about jealous relatives stealing the family jewels to make you believe that a little bit of paranoia might be a good thing.\n\nI don't think that were at fault for wearing them at your special event, but I would recommend trying to not wear them around your half-sister going forward.
