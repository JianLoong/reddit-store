Is your sister someone who matters to you, and overall you have a good relationship with her?

I get that her feelings are hurt and she wants to feel like an equal in the heirloom department because you share a mother the jewelry was purchased for. That stings.

My sister once bought me a bracelet from the 1920s and it's so beautiful I'm afraid to wear it and lose it.", "NTA- because it's not your jewelery and even If It was, you wouldn't be obligated to lendo.

I think it has more to do with the relationship between mother and daughter than that OP was in the limelight on her graduation day.

That means you don't under any circumstances let your stepsister wear them. Things have a way of going wrong. Just say no and stay strong. Do not break your dad's trust. Ask your mom if she has something special she could let her wear so she doesn't feel left out. It's not up to you to do this.", "NTA but I might consider floating it by your mom that she should get your little sister some jewelry. I can understand why Lil sis is disappointed.

Unless you regularly attend balls and art galas I think you can mitigate this with time and some conflict avoidance", "No honey, she didn't take that as you insulting her relationship with her dad... She used it against you because of her relationship with her dad! She knew exactly what you were saying! She's desperately acting out to do anything she can to get her way... Which I don't even understand because heirloom implies that it's been the family for generations. Since your dad got it in divorce, I'm going to guess it came from his family which means his ex-wife's new daughter doesn't have any right to it! It's just weird that she would even think she does.

Maybe you can find a nice necklace for her graduation present?", "I think the root problem is that the sister believes 0P has a better father than she does. There\u2019s nothing that OP can do to change that.\n\nThe jewelry is a physical manifestation of the problem. OP could try to establish a new family tradition that includes her sister.

There's a whole generation of people that kept plates/stuff they never used because they were saving them for \"special occasions.\" All it did was prevent them from having/creating their own good memories with it.\n\nAlso maybe a weird take, but I wouldn't want to wear an heirloom from some else's family? It seems like she's after the flash and not the sentimental aspect, which is the actual point of it, isn't it?", "NTA \n\nIt was fine to ask, but your dad said no.
