We got married young and it\u2019s wasn\u2019t a good marriage. Cara was traditionally attractive and whenever we got married she acted like she settled and never stopped anyone from suggesting she was better looking. When our daughter was little she didn\u2019t stop going out because her friends were single. Every weekend I was at home watching our kid. During this time I became friends with my daughters teacher amber. She was previously divorced and became someone I confided with. She would constantly hype me up about myself. Then some of my friends see Cara flirting with guys at a bar. I ask her about it. She says I was being jealous and should just be \u201chappy that she choose me\u201d. That was the final straw and we divorced 7 years ago. \n\nAfter I divorced me and amber became very close friends. Cara\u2019s convinced that amber broke up our marriage even though I\u2019ve said countless times she never once told me to do that. Me and amber didn\u2019t start dating until 4 years after my divorce. We just were good friends and then eventually everything clicked 4 years later (and multiple partners in between). \n\nSo now to my ex wife issues. So amber and my daughter have formed a very close friendship. Amber was \u201caunt amber\u201d for 3 years whenever my daughter was young. So lots of Christmas and birthday gifts. She helped me with some of the girl dad things I didn\u2019t know how to do. Now we\u2019ve been dating 4 years so she\u2019s know amber for a total of 7 years. Ambers sister is getting married and has asked my daughter to be a bridesmaid. Part of being a bridesmaid is going on the bachelorette party which is at a beach area about 5 hours from where we live so I have no problem with her going with amber. They have spent time alone plenty of times and the woman is a teacher. I have no concerns. My ex wife is blowing up about it. Saying she doesn\u2019t trust the situation and it\u2019s against the rules of our custody to allow her overnight without my supervision. I said that isn\u2019t true, and if she wants to make a big deal about it then I\u2019ll go to the bachelorette party, rent a nearby hotel room and say I\u2019m in the vicinity in case of emergency. My wife\u2019s sister isn\u2019t that wild of a person, I don\u2019t see this becoming out of hand. The other issue my ex has is a tattoo that is gonna be happening after the trip. My girlfriend wants a \u201clegacy tattoo\u201d. Which is going to be a tree with her grandmas name, her moms name, her sisters name and then my daughters name. It\u2019s like a family tattoo. We asked my daughter if she had any issue with it. She didn\u2019t and absolutely loved the idea of it. My ex wife is telling my parents about it now. Saying it she is uncomfortable and I don\u2019t care. I said personally it doesn\u2019t bother me and it\u2019s not harming anyone so I plan to allow for both. My ex is now dragging my name thru the mud to our mutual friends about it.

What group of adults wants a child at a bachelorette party? Whats their plan for the party? What are the activities planned? What will they be eating and drinking? Who all will be there? Does everyone know a child will be present? It\u2019s perfectly reasonable for your ex to demand answers to those questions and you should be doing the same for yourself before letting her attend.", "The tattoo is weird as hell. Your girlfriend is just a girlfriend. She isn\u2019t even a step parent. Your daughter does not have a branch on her family tree.\n\nAn overnight bachelorette party is not the place for a 12 year old.", "NTA tho I would absolutely verify overnighting custody rules to be 100% sure you\u2019re correct on the sleeping arrangements. Last thing you need is to be in court over something new.", "YTA. Do you really think a bachelorette party is somewhere for a 12 year old? Mine was extremely tame, but we went wine tasting and did other things involving alcohol. I wouldn\u2019t want a child around for that and I\u2019d wonder who\u2019s watching out for her. It really sounds like you\u2019re trying to get one over on your ex. Also, check what your custody agreement says word for word. Mine definitely has language about overnight trips and we also have first right of refusal. Maybe there is a compromise where she could go to one thing like brunch and then go back home with you. \n\nThe tattoo is weird. Technically your girlfriend can get whatever she wants, but I\u2019d be really weirded out if anyone got my kid\u2019s name tattooed on a family tree that wasn\u2019t actually her family tree. Ultimately, your ex can\u2019t control that one though, but I\u2019d really think about how comfortable you are with it. You\u2019re not even married or anything.", "ESH because I feel like these is more missing here. There also seems to be a disregard for the fact your gf has no parental rights over your daughter, but you take into account her opinion but refuse to take into consideration your daughters mothers input. \n\nFirstly your custody agreement is not open to interpretation, so get that bottomed out. Would you be comfortable for your daughter to go on holiday with your ex's boyfriend of 4 years, on her own, in the future without input into the decision? Pick your battles because the same rules apply both ways. \n\nThe tattoo thing has nothing to do with your ex, however she has every right not to like it. Your not married or engaged, so I can understand why she is uncomfortable with another woman putting her daughters name on her body. However she can't do anything about it, so she will have to get over it. Your daughter might not like it so much if you break up, so make sure you explain that element to your daughter.\n\nBeing a teacher means nothing. I work within the school community in HR, each year there is new safeguarding rules because of something horrible a teach did, being a teacher doesn't make you a good person automatically. It just means that your criminal record is clear, which is why safeguarding is so important around children because the fact is, you just don't know what someone is capable of doing.", "YTA!! TF!!", "NAH\nDouble check your custody arrangement just to be sure it's all good. \nIt sounds like there's some information left out, but from what you've said it sounds likes standard bad-divorce vibes.\n\nYour ex might be talking trash but she's an ex.  She isn't threatening to sue for full custody, she's expressing discomfort at being 'replaced' in your daughter's life.  Which is on her to learn to accept. \n\nYou don't have to bend to your ex's whims.  But you might want to consider working on communicating maybe in family therapy for a good co-parenting relationship", "NTA Your ex is jealous that she no longer has someone that she feels as inferior to her and seeing that person thrive with someone else is is just making her even angrier which is her own problem. As long as your daughter is happy and you aren't braking any custody rules then your ex can shove it.", "This is some Jerry Springer shit. Nta I guess lol", "It would seem that because of your past with Cara, you're acting kind of like a petulant teenager now, dismissing Cara's very real concerns about your minor child going to an adult party with someone who is a biological stranger, who has no idea how this bachelorette party is going to turn out.\n\nWill there be alcohol at this party? Will Amber be drinking alcohol while she's in charge of a minor? Why would Amber want to take a child to an adult function? Are there going to be other children there? If it wasn't Cara bringing up this concern, would you be minded to listen? Are you trying to get back at her by ignoring her concerns?\n\nIf it was anyone other than Cara raising these concerns, would you still allow your child to stay overnight with a bunch of strangers, some of whom may be getting drunk, maybe talking about adult topics that children shouldn't be hearing?\n\nI would say YTA for letting your dislike of Cara get in the way of safeguarding your daughter. \n\nAs for the tattoo, that's Amber's business, but I can see why Cara would be angry about it. A person wants to get a tattoo with a child's name, who is not related to them, and who might not even be in their life in five years. Cara doesn't have the right to dictate what Amber gets tattooed on her own body, but she does have a right to feel some type of way about Amber getting her child's name tattooed on her.", "That whole backstory about your ex-wife was completely unnecessary and a waste of time. It has nothing to do with the situation as presented.\n\nThese days, I\u2019m not sure whether someone being a teacher is an asset or a liability.\n\nWhat type of bachelorette party is this? Also, when your wife referenced the custody agreement you \u201csaid that isn\u2019t true.\u201c That is kind of vague. What is the rule, exactly?\n\nYour ex seems quite specific in this and I suspect she\u2019s telling the truth. And then you accuse her of \u201cmaking a big deal out of it\u201c making her seem like the unreasonable one.\n\nAmber might want to check with Pete Davidson before she starts getting tattoos of other people\u2019s kids.\n\nLeaning toward YTA.", "YTA. I\u2019m sorry, but I just don\u2019t understand why anyone would even want a 12 year old at their bachelorette party. Maybe if it\u2019s a bridal party then okay. Idk it just seems a little off to me. And I can understand ex wife being a little uncomfortable with someone else having her child\u2019s name tattooed. You and Amber are not married, correct? Honestly seems like you just greatly dislike your ex. I think you and your ex should sit down and have a calm talk about boundaries.", "NAH with the info that's been provided. \n\nIs this bachelorette party going to be child-friendly? Will someone be sober to care for your daughter in the case of a medical emergency? \n\nAs far as the tattoo - I can see both sides. Your gf clearly loves your daughter and wants to include her as part of her family. But your daughter's mom also has a right to feel some type of way about someone else tattooing her daughter's name on their family tree.", "NTA", "Okay, there are several things going on here, so I'm giving you a part YTA and part NTA:\n\n**YTA** because if there are specific rules of custody and you are breaking them.  It's unclear what your specific arrangement is, but it seems that an overnight trip like this for your daughter to be without either one of her parents can be a cause of concern for your ex.  Even if you see it differently, it's perfectly reasonable for her to have a major problem with this.  I suppose if you did go and let your daughter partake in a few hours of the bachelorette party and it's not against the rules of your custody arrangement, that is a reasonable compromise.  When it comes to kids and specific events like this, both parents should be involved with it.  If your wife doesn't agree to it and it is outside your predefined rules, then YTA for not caring what she thinks.  It might be more of a legal thing, too.  Whether Amber and her sister are chill and not wild is totally irrelevant.\n\nThe situation would be a little different if you were married to Amber.  But for right now, she's your girlfriend.\n\n**NTA** for not caring what your ex wife thinks about Amber's tattoo.  What Amber gets tattooed onto her body is of no concern to your ex wife.  She can go kick sand, pout, moan, and grumble all she wants about this but it is not her call.  It's really not even really your call, so even if you did take your ex-wife's side, it's ultimately up to Amber. \n\nI don't know why Amber would want to go ahead with this tattoo unless you were married and 100% for sure will be together forever.  God forbid you break up!  Amber will have to either birth a child and name her your daughter's name or find another single dad with a daughter with the same name!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If they are inviting a 12 year old it is not going to be wild.", "Yeah who wants a 12 year old at their Bachelorette party? It's just odd. And I do understand not wanting your daughter to be 5 hours away with someone you don't trust. Especially for a Bachelorette party", "Yeah this - maybe the kid could stay with dad at a nearby hotel and join in on any PG activities during the day?", "Yeah, the tattoo is super duper weird. \n\nEspecially a generational family tree tattoo. Your daughter is not part of that maternal line of descent, your girlfriend's isnt even your daughter's step mother..... So it's crazy odd that she's get a tattoo linking her grandmother, mother, herself and then her current boyfriends daughter. \n\nAlso, it's is very weird to take a 12 year old to multiday bachelorette party, again especially an unrelated one ( not the brides child for example). \n\n\nFeels like you guys are really forcing the \"girlfriend is really more a mom that the bio mom\" angle here and it's honestly borderline creepy.", "I\u2019m going NTA but agree on the weirdness of a 12 year old at a bachelorette party. I have been in a handful of weddings and the \u2018junior bridesmaids\u2019 and flower girls weren\u2019t part of the bachelorette. They were invited to age appropriate things like bridal showers, luncheons, manicures the day before, etc. I can see why your ex is concerned about this. What is Amber and her friends planning that a 12 year old can attend? Are they all sober? Your daughter doesn\u2019t need to be around a bunch of women where she only knows Amber and sister and they are drinking. \n\nBut the tattoo isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s call but the person who is getting it.", "Main reason I said YTA is because I think OP is hiding something. He spends the first half of the post insulting his ex, when none of it was relevant to the problem. And I completely agree with everything you said about a 12 year old being at the party. It makes no sense. Most bachelorette parties are no where near child appropriate. And I think ex had a right to be concerned about that. And yes, the tattoo does come down to whoever is getting it. But I would feel a little uncomfortable with that as a parent, true ex can\u2019t stop it. But I understand her voicing her feelings", "You may very well be correct about him hiding something.
