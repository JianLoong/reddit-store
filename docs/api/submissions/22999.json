I think this is the stupidest argument we\u2019ve ever had, but she\u2019s still mad so I thought I\u2019d appeal to the masses. \n\n I was out of town for five days over the Fourth of July, and paid her to feed my two cats while I was gone. (I\u2019ve done this for her family and their dog in the past too.) She was being really terse and short with me after I got back, and I kept asking if something was wrong, but she wouldn\u2019t admit to it. Until we met in person a couple days later so I could get my keys back, and then she exploded. \n\n There\u2019s no way to sugarcoat this, so I\u2019ll just say it: I left an adult \u201ctoy\u201c in the shower. I\u2019m a single lady, I live by myself, and it doesn\u2019t even look like *that*; it\u2019s one of those stylized ones that if you\u2019re an adult, you\u2019ll definitely know what it is, but let\u2019s say you\u2019re a three year old? You\u2019ll have no idea. (It\u2019s also bright purple if that makes a difference ha ha)\n\n So yeah. Her kid was messing around in the bathroom, pulled back to shower curtain, and saw it. Being in the question phase of life she asked her mom what\u2019s that? My friend told her it\u2019s a toy. And left it at that.  But apparently she was shocked and mortified that her daughter had been exposed to such a thing at such a young age. I thought she was overreacting, but I still apologized & figured that was it. \n \nNope! She\u2019s still mad because I guess her daughter will still get into the tub and point out how she has bath toys, and auntie OK_pie also has bath toys.  I think it\u2019s funny because it\u2019s one of those things that means nothing to a kid but those to an adult, and she\u2019s gonna find something else to ~~fix it~~ fixate on in a week or two.\n\nBut they are going on a vacation with a bunch of her in-laws soon, and she is \u201cterrified\u201c that her kid is going to say this while on vacation and she\u2019ll have to explain it to her in-laws. I told her she doesn\u2019t have to explain anything, she can just make something up like oh I gave her some bath toys or something. This is not the big deal she is making it out to be. Now she says I am being insensitive to her feelings. \n\n We\u2019ve been friends since we were like nine years old, and I maintain this is the stupidest argument we\u2019ve ever had.

I presume that means dropping in once or twice a day, cleaning the cats' food bowls, putting down fresh food, changing their water and litter tray, and then leaving again? Is that right? Your friend wasn't spending the whole day there or sleeping there?\n\nIf so... you weren't paying her to have her daughter \"mess around in the bathroom\", whatever that means. You weren't paying her to have her daughter pull back the shower curtain and see what you may have left there. If she brings her daughter along because she has no one to leave the daughter with, or because the daughter wants to play with the cats for a while, it is incumbent on your friend to supervise the child.\n\nThe only reason her daughter should have been in the bathroom at all would be to use the toilet and then wash her hands, under her mother's supervision. She is three. She understands \"Don't touch\". If the child was allowed into rooms unsupervised, to \"mess around\" and do whatever the hell she wanted, you have a right to be annoyed.\n\nSo if your friend keeps flinging this (very trivial) incident in your face, ask her why her daughter was \"messing around\" in your bathroom in the first place.", "Not sure how much you can indulge crazy. \n\nI have a bright and inquisitive 4.5 year old who always surprises me with how much she knows...yet she'd have *no* idea what that was, would assume it was some version of a rubber ducky and that would be that. \n\nYour friend has issues.", "NTA\n\nYou asked her to feed your cats, not snoop in your shower. It's YOUR house.", "NTA. You\u2019re an adult. It\u2019s not like you left it out on purpose and are having a laugh at it. The child will definitely move on to something else very quickly.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t leave a realistic toy in the middle of your living room, it was in the shower and the kid didn\u2019t even understand what she found.\n\nThis is your home, and she was there to feed the cats, so why did the child snoop around anyway?", "NTA\n\nYour friend failed to intelligently answer that question. You don\u2019t call it a toy, you say it\u2019s a \u201cstress remover, it gives massages, but we don\u2019t touch other people\u2019s things, right?\u201d\n\nAs you pointed out, she continues to fail at finding and imaginative explanation. \n\nWorse of all, her kid has no idea, so this can easily be a funny/embarrassing story to tell, but she\u2019s turning it into drama.", "NTA of course. I wouldn't go so far as to say the child had no reason to snoop because she is 3, she lacks liability. But if your friend wasn't such a prude facebook mummy she would (love) laugh with you about it and just tell the inlaws you got a rubber bunny bath toy and let the chips fall where they may", "NTA\n\nThough I\u2019m kinda curious if her husband has heard their kid say this & what her explanation to him was.", "Lol you\u2019re a grown woman she\u2019s the asshole for letting her child roam around your house", "NTA - kid snooped - it wasn\u2019t in a visible place (not that it really matters!) - friend is overreacting for sure! Her daughter will probably have forgotten by now as a passing observation!", "Clear NTA. It would be a no AH if your friend wasn't pushing it so hard. Unless the kid's been given WAY too much detail and would blurt out \"Auntie OK has a plastic stick for her Buh-gina\", I don't see anything embarrassing coming from it. It sounds like a bit of a sex hang up where your friend is treating it like you left it out in order for the kid to find it and have now polluted her with dirty sex thoughts. \n\nHopefully, this is something you two can laugh about in the future. Would your friend be open to gaslighting the kid by changing the story to what she found was a bottle of fancy shampoo or some other shower unguent? I'm thinking that if the kid saying you have a weird bottle opens up less routes for embarrassment than using the word \"toy\".", "NTA - Friend os overreacting.", "NTA. The kid is three. As you say, she has no idea what she saw, and nothing about this experience is going to scar her for life. And frankly there was no reason for the kid to be playing around in your bathroom anyway - mom should know better than to let a toddler mess around in a house that isn\u2019t likely to be kid-proof, and bathrooms can have all sorts of unsafe things for a curious little kid (razors, medications, cleaning products, bath bombs that look edible, hot water taps).", "NTA you\u2019re friend is choosing to make a mountain out a mole hill. You\u2019re totally right the kid has no clue and will never know it\u2019s anything other than a toy unless her mom makes her think it\u2019s weird and she\u2019ll probably never even remember this and you\u2019re also right you\u2019re friend can totally dismiss it with her family on vaca with out a hitch.\n\nYou had no clue the kid would be playing in your shower there was no need for you to have to make sure your house was child proof before you left on vaca you did nothing wrong", "NTA. The daughter obviously has no clue and doesn't care, but if your friend keeps making a fuss about it every time she sees a bathroom then yeah, it will become a big deal.", "Obviously NTA\nIf she didn't want her daughter to find toys:) she shouldn't have let her daughter snoop around in your house\nShe is overreacting", "NTA. All she has to do is buy her kid a rubber duck and a little boat or something so she has bath toys herself and the kid will move on with her life, oblivious to what she actually found. This is on your friend for not supervising her kid in your apartment. It's not like you left it out to greet them on the hallway floor.", "NTA, the worst possible outcome is everyone has a laugh. She's overreacting.", "NTA lol\nSame thing happened to me with an aunts daughter, the kid also wanted to know what this weird toy was, haha. The mum had a good laugh and that was it.", "I\u2019m with ya\u2019.  No harm no foul.  I\u2019d have a good laugh to, but I have a good sense of humor.  AITA?  Nah, your friend is.", "You're NTA. Your friend is making a mountain out of a molehill.", "NTA - a toy in your shower behind a curtain isn't some unreasonable scandalous thing to have left, there's some expectation of privacy. Your friend is overthinking things, kids say wild stuff all the time and sometimes there isn't an explanation. If she doesn't want to explain she could laugh it off as an unexpected toddler saying, or she can make something up like maybe you have bath bombs and called them toys.", "NTA.   \n\n\nYour friend sounds like she's one freakout away from protesting outside a drag show. Simply SEEING something isn't going to turn her kid into some deviant.   \n\n\nWhen I was 5 i loved filling out forms, like random sign-up things. My mom found one and came to me ' why did you put yes next to sex? '. It was obviously asking if I was male or female but I was 5. She asked if I knew what it meant. I said ' No, but i know grown-ups like it! ' I also used to go around saying ' I'M A VIRGIN' to adults bc I learned I was a *Virgo* .  \n\n\nAre we gonna act like kids haven't had that day where they rifle through their parent's stuff and find something horrifying? Pretty sure that teaches you to mind your business at a young age.   \n\n\n She needs to get a sense of humour, bc honestly,", "Give the daughter some kind of super cool bath toy for her to take on the family vacation and if she mentions her aunties toy then there is an easy explanation. \n\nNTA", "NTA why was her 3yr old unattended in your bathroom? That\u2019s in her not you.", "Its really not a big deal, kids not gonna be harmed by seeing it, probably already forgot.  Though that said I think even if one lives alone its socially proper to put ones adult toys out of sight if others are coming over.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

All your friend has to do is claim ignorance.", "NTA\n\nShe can literally tell them her friend has rubber ducks in her bathroom. Nobody would prod further. She's completely overreacting.

They shouldn't be.", "We got a huge bag of the cheap clay litter for free once and put some in half of our litter boxes. Our one cat, who came to us declawed, put one paw in the clay litter, looked at both of us, then maintained eye contact as he backed against the wall and peed. Message received, lol. Immediately changed the litter in that box, his preferred one. \n\nVet later told us it was likely because that kind of litter would easily get caught in the pockets of his paws where his claws had been.", "My brother and his wife at the time came home from visiting family to find an open and half-eaten bag of bread in the middle of the kitchen floor.

People are trying to defend this like \"oh kids just get into stuff\", but this is someone else's house, it's not baby-proofed, there's probably hard liquor around and definitely cleaning supplies. And I bet it's all just as easy, if not easier, to access. If her kid somehow managed to climb up the fridge, get two bottles/cans out, open them, and drink them without the mother noticing then that kid could have drunk drain cleaner and died. Plus we also know she somehow managed to wander off into the bathroom without her mum noticing. That's a pretty negligent lack of attention on at least 3 separate occasions and OP probably hasn't heard the half of it.", "My parents\u2019 dog will pull loaves of bread off the counter, and eat them, bag and all.

Little weirdos.", "NTA.  She is getting all upset over nothing.  She is being ridiculous. So what if her daughter says you have bath toys? Why would ANYONE care? Her prudishness is taking control of her brain.", "NTA but your \"friend\" is! It's your house, you can leave whatever you want wherever you want. Her 3 year old has no idea what that toy was and will eventually forget about it. She's being incredibly sex negative and super shaming of you.", "NTA - she is way overreacting. She is way too uncomfortable with adult toys. This was an \"accident\" and if she's going to fixate on it then rethink your friendship because she's got issues.", " NTA at all!! This could have been a funny story but your friend decided to turn it in to a huge issue.

The child is old enough to fixate on it, young enough to not blow a lie. I'm a grown adult and I have the occasional toy from my childhood out on a desk. Transformers, MLP, etc. My husband is a lego fanatic. Adults can legit have toys that aren't \"toys\".", "NTA\n\nAlso, username checks out", "NTA.  You\u2019re a grown adult who lives alone.  Mom\u2019s explanation was sufficient and age appropriate.   Your friend soinds uptight.", "NTA.

It could have been sooooo much worse. I am reminded of that TV ad (I can\u2019t remember what it was for) where a couple of moms are on the front porch while their kids play in the yard, and suddenly the moms all realize that the kids have gotten into someone\u2019s toy stash and are having a swordfight with dildos.", "The real question is why is a 3 year old in a bathroom unsupervised", "The litter box didn't have to at least be scooped for 5 days?!? That poor cat.", "Yo, NTA but is your cat shitting in the tray and it's getting left for....five days?", "OP, you are NTA of course! \n\nWhat I don't understand is what your friend wants now at this point.  You've apologized (though you really had nothing to apologize for...just social niceties, I'm sure).  Surely your friend must realize that you are not responsible for her own awkwardness.  She needs to grow up a little.\n\nThree-year-olds move on really quickly. Your friend is spending way too much mental energy on this.", "That's what I was thinking too.", "The kid will probably get over it by then anyway.\n\nMy son found my toy in my draw once, he said mommy has a worm in her draw for a bout 2-3 days and then never mentioned it again.", "Yeah, I don't get all the people in this thread acting like a household with only adults can't have a rubber duckie.

That kids are just allowed to go digging into areas of the home that most people would understand or off limits, just because their kids? \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\n\nYou are not a sane person, for thinking that the kid wasn't snooping, and wasn't digging around in places they shouldn't have been going in the first place. \ud83e\udd37\ud83e\udd37", "It was definitely the orange cat.

Your friend is the only one making it weird.", "Moving away from the animals eating weird things, NTA. Your friend is over reacting for some reason.

No one is going to demand that she produce a scale drawing of the object with details on its purpose and operation.", "NTA it is your house maybe she should have been paying attention to the child instead of letting her play in the BATHROOM of all places. I know personally I keep chemicals in my bathroom rather than kitchen to lower the risk of contaminating my food.

You didn't need to apologize (although kudos to you for being a bigger person) as this was an invasion of your privacy. \n\nYour friend is \"terrified\" over a scenario that has not and may not even happen. All in all, it was a funny situation and your friend needs to get over it.", "NTA. You already know this is much ado about nothing. A three-year-old saw a purple toy. It's your friend -- applying an adult mind -- who's blowing this gaffe all out of proportion. At that young age the child will believe whatever is told to her. Say it was a back scratcher that Barney, the purple dinosaur left behind.. something like that. Laugh it off and switch the subject.\n\nUnfortunately, you friend is acting like you left a crack pipe for her daughter to find. The child will take cues about the incident from adults around her.
