I\u2019m a single lady, I live by myself, and it doesn\u2019t even look like *that*; it\u2019s one of those stylized ones that if you\u2019re an adult, you\u2019ll definitely know what it is, but let\u2019s say you\u2019re a three year old?

I told her she doesn\u2019t have to explain anything, she can just make something up like oh I gave her some bath toys or something. This is not the big deal she is making it out to be.

I presume that means dropping in once or twice a day, cleaning the cats' food bowls, putting down fresh food, changing their water and litter tray, and then leaving again? Is that right? Your friend wasn't spending the whole day there or sleeping there?\n\nIf so... you weren't paying her to have her daughter \"mess around in the bathroom\", whatever that means. You weren't paying her to have her daughter pull back the shower curtain and see what you may have left there. If she brings her daughter along because she has no one to leave the daughter with, or because the daughter wants to play with the cats for a while, it is incumbent on your friend to supervise the child.\n\nThe only reason her daughter should have been in the bathroom at all would be to use the toilet and then wash her hands, under her mother's supervision. She is three. She understands \"Don't touch\". If the child was allowed into rooms unsupervised, to \"mess around\" and do whatever the hell she wanted, you have a right to be annoyed.\n\nSo if your friend keeps flinging this (very trivial) incident in your face, ask her why her daughter was \"messing around\" in your bathroom in the first place.", "Not sure how much you can indulge crazy. \n\nI have a bright and inquisitive 4.5 year old who always surprises me with how much she knows...yet she'd have *no* idea what that was, would assume it was some version of a rubber ducky and that would be that. \n\nYour friend has issues.", "NTA\n\nYou asked her to feed your cats, not snoop in your shower. It's YOUR house.", "NTA. You\u2019re an adult. It\u2019s not like you left it out on purpose and are having a laugh at it. The child will definitely move on to something else very quickly.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t leave a realistic toy in the middle of your living room, it was in the shower and the kid didn\u2019t even understand what she found.\n\nThis is your home, and she was there to feed the cats, so why did the child snoop around anyway?", "NTA\n\nYour friend failed to intelligently answer that question. You don\u2019t call it a toy, you say it\u2019s a \u201cstress remover, it gives massages, but we don\u2019t touch other people\u2019s things, right?\u201d\n\nAs you pointed out, she continues to fail at finding and imaginative explanation. \n\nWorse of all, her kid has no idea, so this can easily be a funny/embarrassing story to tell, but she\u2019s turning it into drama.", "NTA of course. I wouldn't go so far as to say the child had no reason to snoop because she is 3, she lacks liability. But if your friend wasn't such a prude facebook mummy she would (love) laugh with you about it and just tell the inlaws you got a rubber bunny bath toy and let the chips fall where they may", "NTA\n\nThough I\u2019m kinda curious if her husband has heard their kid say this & what her explanation to him was.", "Lol you\u2019re a grown woman she\u2019s the asshole for letting her child roam around your house", "NTA - kid snooped - it wasn\u2019t in a visible place (not that it really matters!) - friend is overreacting for sure! Her daughter will probably have forgotten by now as a passing observation!", "Clear NTA. It would be a no AH if your friend wasn't pushing it so hard. Unless the kid's been given WAY too much detail and would blurt out \"Auntie OK has a plastic stick for her Buh-gina\", I don't see anything embarrassing coming from it. It sounds like a bit of a sex hang up where your friend is treating it like you left it out in order for the kid to find it and have now polluted her with dirty sex thoughts. \n\nHopefully, this is something you two can laugh about in the future. Would your friend be open to gaslighting the kid by changing the story to what she found was a bottle of fancy shampoo or some other shower unguent? I'm thinking that if the kid saying you have a weird bottle opens up less routes for embarrassment than using the word \"toy\".", "NTA - Friend os overreacting.", "NTA. The kid is three. As you say, she has no idea what she saw, and nothing about this experience is going to scar her for life. And frankly there was no reason for the kid to be playing around in your bathroom anyway - mom should know better than to let a toddler mess around in a house that isn\u2019t likely to be kid-proof, and bathrooms can have all sorts of unsafe things for a curious little kid (razors, medications, cleaning products, bath bombs that look edible, hot water taps).", "NTA you\u2019re friend is choosing to make a mountain out a mole hill. You\u2019re totally right the kid has no clue and will never know it\u2019s anything other than a toy unless her mom makes her think it\u2019s weird and she\u2019ll probably never even remember this and you\u2019re also right you\u2019re friend can totally dismiss it with her family on vaca with out a hitch.\n\nYou had no clue the kid would be playing in your shower there was no need for you to have to make sure your house was child proof before you left on vaca you did nothing wrong", "NTA. The daughter obviously has no clue and doesn't care, but if your friend keeps making a fuss about it every time she sees a bathroom then yeah, it will become a big deal.", "Obviously NTA\nIf she didn't want her daughter to find toys:) she shouldn't have let her daughter snoop around in your house\nShe is overreacting", "NTA. All she has to do is buy her kid a rubber duck and a little boat or something so she has bath toys herself and the kid will move on with her life, oblivious to what she actually found. This is on your friend for not supervising her kid in your apartment. It's not like you left it out to greet them on the hallway floor.", "NTA, the worst possible outcome is everyone has a laugh. She's overreacting.", "NTA lol\nSame thing happened to me with an aunts daughter, the kid also wanted to know what this weird toy was, haha. The mum had a good laugh and that was it.", "I\u2019m with ya\u2019.  No harm no foul.  I\u2019d have a good laugh to, but I have a good sense of humor.  AITA?  Nah, your friend is.", "You're NTA. Your friend is making a mountain out of a molehill.", "NTA - a toy in your shower behind a curtain isn't some unreasonable scandalous thing to have left, there's some expectation of privacy. Your friend is overthinking things, kids say wild stuff all the time and sometimes there isn't an explanation. If she doesn't want to explain she could laugh it off as an unexpected toddler saying, or she can make something up like maybe you have bath bombs and called them toys.", "NTA.   \n\n\nYour friend sounds like she's one freakout away from protesting outside a drag show. Simply SEEING something isn't going to turn her kid into some deviant.   \n\n\nWhen I was 5 i loved filling out forms, like random sign-up things. My mom found one and came to me ' why did you put yes next to sex? '. It was obviously asking if I was male or female but I was 5. She asked if I knew what it meant. I said ' No, but i know grown-ups like it! ' I also used to go around saying ' I'M A VIRGIN' to adults bc I learned I was a *Virgo* .  \n\n\nAre we gonna act like kids haven't had that day where they rifle through their parent's stuff and find something horrifying? Pretty sure that teaches you to mind your business at a young age.   \n\n\n She needs to get a sense of humour, bc honestly,", "Give the daughter some kind of super cool bath toy for her to take on the family vacation and if she mentions her aunties toy then there is an easy explanation. \n\nNTA", "NTA why was her 3yr old unattended in your bathroom? That\u2019s in her not you.", "Its really not a big deal, kids not gonna be harmed by seeing it, probably already forgot.  Though that said I think even if one lives alone its socially proper to put ones adult toys out of sight if others are coming over.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

How does that happen!", "I think they meant feed the cats all the treats.", "they probably played with the cats and fed them most of the bag of treats which is why they\u2019re gone. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t mind personally if a friend took one or two drinks out of my fridge cuz it\u2019s just a drink but I know them well enough where they\u2019d tell me they did so. OP\u2019s friend is being the weirdo here fixating on a toy that a child just thinks is a bath toy and not telling OP what exactly they did in her house where the kid played around in the bath. \n\nIt makes me think they did other things like snoop around the house or something when they were just supposed to feed the cats, not even play with them, and she\u2019s freaking out that the kid dropped a hint to OP that they did so. She\u2019s making a big deal out of nothing and going from 0-100, the kid just thinks it\u2019s a bath toy AND she\u2019ll probably forget in like a week. SHES THREE", "No her daughter did. I was a little annoyed cuz I\u2019ve cut out soda and the water is more like a treat for me & I was worried the cats might get sick from so many treats", "Wow, you are stingy!", "Drinking two sparkling waters is a dick move? When friend was feeding her cats? That's maybe $3 in sparkling water.", "Yeah, it's not like OP left the door to the sex dungeon unlocked, with a slave still in there in suspension. Friend needs to lighten TFU.", "Picturing this really made me laugh. Thank you. \ud83d\ude01\n\n(FTR, NTA OP.)", "No but now I\u2019d totally pay someone to make that happen haha!", "This is a really good point- if I was OP, I\u2019d be far more annoyed that her friend has now relayed all of this back to the husband- guess what he\u2019s going to be laughing about next time he\u2019s in the pub with his mates?!!\n\nI\u2019d say that\u2019s a pretty egregious breach of OP\u2019s right to privacy in her own damn home!! Many people in OP\u2019s position would now feel awkward and embarrassed around her husband and any friends they may share. It is the \u2018friend\u2019 whose behaviour should be in question, not OPs.", "I guess he was on bedtime duty and kiddo mentioned it, so he asked my friend what it meant & she explained. But yeahhhhh I\u2019m not super stoked about that. He\u2019s a chill guy so I know he\u2019ll never mention it but it feels weird.", "Sounds like the friend is to uptight and prudish to have her own toy that the kid could accidentally find. She probably only has sex under the sheets with the lights off.", "It\u2019s *her* shower. She can have, in all honestly, whatever the hell she wants in *her* shower. She paid for cat feeding, not house cleaning or house sitting or bathroom inspections. Frankly I\u2019d be upset that my friend went snooping in my shower if I were her. What are you supposed to do? Baby proof your entire house just in case her daughter \u201cmesses with your drawers\u201d too?", "In all reality, the toy was put away. Behind the shower curtain, where no one was supposed to be going. Would you say the same thing if it had been in her closed bedroom? If it had been in her closet and the kid decided to go snooping through there? If it was in the drawers of her dresser and the kid decided to snoop there?\n\nThe toy was nowhere where the kid would have reasonably found it if she hadn't been messing around. The toy was nowhere where the kid would have found it if her mom had been actually watching her and doing her job as a parent.", ">  It's just a toy, the kid probably also has bath toys so for her it might not even mean anything.", "Seriously, Friend sounds like Helen Lovejoy shrieking \"Won't somebody PLEASE think of the children?!?\" She needs to remove the stick from her ass, like yesterday.", "Sure thing!\n\nBy the way, what does FTR mean?", "Please setup a camera if you do.. I really want to see your friends reaction!", "I think it means For The Record", "Yep, for the record. Sorry!", "For The Record", "For the record", "Ahh, that makes sense! Thank you"]}
