You don\u2019t have to go into detail.\u201d I told her that she asked and she said \u201cAll you need to see is that you don\u2019t love the photo. You don\u2019t need to tell me how horrible I look in it.\u201d \n\nI feel bad now. I didn\u2019t mean to offend her.

She didn\u2019t ask for a detailed critique of how she looked badly in the photo. \n\nWorse, after she said \u201cbrutally honest\u201d YOU KEPT TALKING! Dumb move. That was the clue that she didn\u2019t want to hear anymore, dude, and that is what makes you an AH.", "YTA. You can be honest without being a dick about it lol", "Lol I need to show this to my gf so she knows I\u2019m not the worst bf. Thanks OP", "YTA, you provided way too much for such a simple question. Even following up a \"no\" with a \"...I don't really like the pic\" is better than \"Your posture is awful and it's a bad picture of you. You just don't look good in it.\" \n\nWould you want her to say these things to you?", "YTA\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d is not an excuse for unnecessary rudeness", "Anytime I feel annoyed with my bf, I'll look at this post and realise I could have it much, much, MUCH worse. \n\nYTA, btw, in case it wasn't glaringly obvious.", "YTA. Read the room (Unless for medical obv). I'll tell you when it changed from being honest to being a bit of a jerk.\n\n\u201cYeah I don\u2019t like that one at all.

I thought she was posed weird and it didn\u2019t do her amazing body any justice.\"\n\nOne is constructive (if thats how your relationship is built) : but the other digs a bit deeper on the mean side of things. When she seemed offended, and you could tell she was hurt, digging in harder was not the right call. Long story short: If you meet resistance and a person is hurt, going further is for you, not them in most conversations.", "I think after her saying \u201cDamn brutually honest\u201d might have been a cue to cut it there\u2026Yes she asked and it\u2019s good to be honest but unless she asked \u201cWell what is it you don\u2019t like about this photo?\u201d I feel the additional comments were unnecessary\u2026.", "Connotation of words matter. Your girlfriend trusts you to be honest with her, but you can do it nicely. For example, you could say \u201cI like these 5 the best\u201d if she still pushes you on one of the ones you don\u2019t like, you could say \u201cI personally think you look better in others, but if you\u2019re in love with this one than go for it\u201d. \n\nYou\u2019ve got to be diplomatic with people, perception equals reality. And using strong connotation words like \u201creally bad\u201d as opposed to something like \u201cnot your best\u201d or adding \u201cawful\u201d when it doesn\u2019t need to be, is just too much negativity. \n\nOr to put it in short words you\u2019ve got to let her down gently if you have something negative to say. You kinda dropped \u201copinion bombs\u201d on her in a very harsh way. \n\nYTA. (For context: I\u2019m married, I\u2019ve been with her almost 4 years, and she also takes her image very serious and expects honesty about photos)\n\nEdit: agree with others to add a \u201csoft\u201d to my judgement, but these things are important to your partner, don\u2019t get it twisted. Words can hurt extra hard coming from a loved one don\u2019t forget that.", "YTA.\n\nIt's okay to be honest, and that's a valuable trait. But maybe be a little kinder when criticizing someone else's appearance. If she didn't look great, that's fair of you to tell her, but if she's already asking about it it's because she's sensitive to how she looks. \n\nTry, \"I think the pose is a little off\" instead of \"that posture is awful\", etc. \n\nApologize and let her know you think she looks great. Tell her the truth: that you feel bad that you hurt her feelings, that you just wanted to be honest, but you realize now could have been a little nicer about it.", "YTA, but not not horribly. She was asking for your opinion, not a detailed criticism. Just should have said you didn't like it/she looks better in the other ones.", "YTA, you purposefully communicated the way an asshole would", "Yta. Theres a big difference between \"maybe not that one\" and \"you just don't look good\". Have some tact.", "Yeah that was dumb. Too much detail . YTA.   It\u2019s just an Instagram post, not a tryout for the Vogue cover.  \u201cEh not my favorite\u201d would have sufficed at most, at best just \u201cI like them all, whatever ones you want\u201d", "She asked which ones you like, she didn\u2019t ask you to rudely critique her. YTA man. She deserves better", "YTA. In my experience, brutal honesty tends to be more brutal than honest. Compassion for your GF is just as important as your honesty. A simple \u201cthis isn\u2019t the most flattering picture of you to post on Instagram, but the others look beautiful\u201d would have sufficed.", "I don\u2019t know that you are a full on AH, I just think you may have not learned how to have tact. We used to say that my dad had the \u201ctact of a rattlesnake\u201d, he didn\u2019t mean to be mean and cruel, I just think that like him, you could have put it gentler. Something more like \u201cyou looked awesome and beautiful in all the pictures, but this one the angle didn\u2019t do your beauty justice\u201d, would have been a nicer way of putting it lol.", "You weren\u2019t honest, you were demeaning. Your response could have been tactful. Example? Say there\u2019s a pretty a girl around and your girlfriend asks you if you think she\u2019s pretty. You can say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cyes, and I\u2019d fuck her if I was single\u201d - see the difference? YTA in any galaxy you\u2019d need to ask this", "It's good to be honest but you also need to sprinkle way more kindness in there. Like...\n\nI'd leave this one out...it doesn't do your amazing body justice. \n\nThe end. No need to comment further.\n\nYTA.", "Borderline YTA. I think the issue here is going into the additional detail without her requesting the additional detail. Obviously if a girl is asking you to critique her photos she is going to be someone who is very critical about their own appearance and take above average offense to criticism on their looks. Me personally, I would have just said I didn't like the photo and left it at that. If she asked for my reasoning, then I would have said all those things. I think that the key here was she wasn't looking for critique, she was just looking for a yay or nay", "Here's how you avoid this in the future.\n\nJust comment on the good ones.\n\nSomething like \"I think these look the best.\"\n\nYTA", "Soft YTA.  \u2018You look great in all pictures as usual.  But this one, something\u2019s must have been wrong with the angle or something\u2019", "NTA. If she can't handle the answer, she shouldn't ask the question to begin with.", "YTA but I think you can recover. All you needed to say was \u201cno, don\u2019t love that one\u201d and proceed with \u2018why\u2019 ONLY if she asked. Even then, tread lightly. Just apologize and explain how beautiful she is and that the photo just didn\u2019t do her justice. It\u2019ll blow over, just don\u2019t be surprised if she never lets you live this down!", "YTA.  It would have been sufficient to just say you don\u2019t like that one as much as the others.  Clearly she liked the photo since it was in her collection of potential posts, so going on and on about how awful she looks was rude and unnecessary.", "YTA. You can say \u201cno, don\u2019t use that for instagram\u201d without adding multiple hurtful comments. You can be honest without being brutal.", "A very slight YTA. I think you should just give a yes or no here, and if she asks why then you can explain. But I think we\u2019ve all been in a situation like this one where you just say a little more than the person wants to hear. An apology + some honest compliments should be all that\u2019s needed.", "If you have to give a negative opinion, I suggest focusing on the object, not the subject. Don't say \"it's a bad picture of you\", just say \"it's a bad picture\". Or \"this one doesn't work quite as well\", or something like that. You don't need to give a negative opinion of the person in the photo.", "NAH. You were honest and just told her what the issue was. However, you probably already learned this lesson, but don't go into detail unless they ask. You could have easily said I don't like this one and left it at that. If she asks why then you drop the truth bomb but not until or unless she asks for it.", "YTA (kind of). She asked your opinion, yes. But it would have been better to say something like \u201cthis one isn\u2019t my favourite. It doesn\u2019t compliment you. I like *this* one a lot better\u201d then proceed to point to the one you like. You\u2019re not lying by saying it like that, just communicating it in a more helpful way.", "NTA - She asked. You were critiquing the photo, not her. She's being over-sensitive.", "nta just dense lol gaw damn", "maybe you could have been a *little* less descriptive but at the same time, she DID as you to give your honest opinion, and you did. this might be a learning moment for her, as in 'don't ask questions you don't want the answers to'\n\nbesides, nearly everyone takes a bad photo now & then. it's not that big of a deal.

I genuinely do not understand why people think that this is a fun thing to do with their partner, or why they think it's a good thing to do.

If asks for more detail I then say what is good about the other pictures, I do not focus on what is wrong with photo 2.
