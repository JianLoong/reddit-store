Especially if you could prove you were telling the truth. Family law courts here are for way more serious things than that.\n\nAnyway. If your son is still pissed at *you* rather than your wife (and let's face it, 15yos will always find *something* to be pissed at their parents about - it's in the job description), you can sympathize, and remind him that 50% of a dog now is better than no dog at all now. In other words: what's past is past, let's focus on the now, and half a dog is still pretty good.\n\nHe may even get more of the fun parts of dog ownership than you do (walks, games, etc) while you will get stuck more often with the less fun parts (feeding, middle of the night toileting, vet visits), so he's getting a pretty good deal.\n\nThen steer the conversation to the exact subject with which you began it: what kind of dog should we get?\n\nNTA.", "Depends on how you said it. Pets are a dual decision, not a 'your mother' decision. \n\nThere were ways to explain how your family lifestyle was different and therefore your ex-wife didn't feel that the family was equipped to take care of a dog correctly. There are ways to make it clear that you love your firstborn and you wanted a dog, but as a family there weren't ways to make it work back then. There are ways to affirm it isn't really fair without making it something that is pinned on someone as blame. That's N-T-A.\n\nAnd then there are ways that say \"Well *I* was always on *your* side, but unfortunately your mother is a controlling witch who wouldn't let us\". And that's YTA: its shifting blame instead of carrying it as a dual decision, and its trying to wash your hands of your own accountability by villainising the other parent.", "NTA.  Your son asked and you answered honestly.  That is *not* parental alienation. At least your son can have a goal for moving out, getting established and *then* getting as many dogs as he wants.\n\nYour son prolly unloaded on his mother and that is his mother's fault.  Not yours. \n\nTake the time to involve your son in caring for and training the new dog.  Let him feel as involved as he wants to be.", "NTA. At least she didn't deny it.", "Around Reddit, a bit of advice in couples relationships is \"two yes, one no.\" It's pretty smart: unless both partners agree, the no vote is an automatic veto.

Your son was upset because he believed you withheld something from him that you were giving to your younger son. You explained why. You didn\u2019t throw your ex under the bus\u2014she is free to explain why she didn\u2019t want a dog.", "If it\u2019s the truth she has no one to blame but herself .NTA", "NTA... if it was the truth. \nBUT often moms dont want a family dog because they get left with all the related work that is involved with caring for a pet. I've seen this first hand. They are often overwhelmed with looking after the kids and housework doing MORE then their share, then they get blamed for not wanting a dog. If that's the case. Be honest", "LOL! no, NTA. she didn't like being confronted with the consequences of her own choices, shocker.", "You bashed a parenting decision that was made *with* your ex (doesn't matter if she was the driving force, you were a *team* at the time) instead of addressing the actual issue with your child and explaining there are multiple factors involved in getting a family pet? Not to mention telling him that sulking because he didn't get something he wanted years ago shows a really bad attitude and that it's actively counterproductive to do that when he is finally *getting* what he wants?\n\nYeah, YTA. I'm sure throwing your ex under the bus felt good in the moment because it temporarily short-circuited your teen's complaints, but in the long run, you taught your kid that it's okay to blame others instead of taking responsibility. Not to mention that it's *really* bad to put a child of divorce in the middle of a conflict between the parents.\n\nI also should point out that you did absolutely nothing to address your teen's concerns that you like your new kid and new family better than him. Instead of reassuring him that *you* loved him, you made him feel like his mom didn't care about him either. Good going...", "I as a kid would know why one of my parents is against something. Why didn't he know that mom was against it until now? My mom would explain that decision to me. It would actually be a family conversation:\n\nMe: I want a dog.\nDad: Ok.\nMom: I don't think so. Who would take care of it? Who would train him? We don't have enough free time and money for a dog. \nMe: I understand \ud83d\ude14.\n\nEven if I would throw a hissy fit over it at that time, I would understand reasons as a teenager.\nNo matter how I see it, as a minimum  YTA for being a bad parent for not explaining your decisions to your kid and defaulting to blanket answer of \"no\". Otherwise mom's decision not having a dog when he was a child would not  come as a surprise now.\n\nEdid: word", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Wild stuff", "You don't know how it was said either, but the fact that the mother called back, absolutely pissed and cussed OP out for \"throwing her under the bus\" tells a lot - she wasn't able to explain their son why she didn't agree, she just attacked OP for putting the onus of the response on her.", ":this:", "[deleted]", "The lack of detail about addressing the teen\u2019s concern doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t happen.

It is her fault. It was rather telling when she called mad as hell that you \"threw her under the bus\" a.k.a ratting her out and now she gots to deal with a pissed off teen. Not to mention he might be questioning alot of other things she tried to blame op for that was actually her all along.", "NTA. I'd tell your son that you and his mom have a real hard time on agreeing to things or negotiating and that is why there was a divorce. You're sorry that until now you weren't in a position to care for a dog. I'd offer the teen the privilege of naming the dog.", "> I told my son that's not true at all. I said I always wanted a dog, but his mother said no.\n\nThat's all the info we have so far. You should either vote based on this or use an INFO. Right now you have voted YTA based on an invented scenario", "No, there's more to it than that. Yes, it's important how OP phrased it originally... but in this scenario, mom is reacting to what *their son* told her. And we have no record of that. OP could have been a model of restrained grace, but if the son was all pissy when he got home, he could have lashed out at mom and framed things differently. Or just yelled at her. Teenagers frequently lash out at parents. OP would have nothing to do with that.", "Lots of times pet care also goes to the husbands too (especially the dirty or physical work).\n\nI don't think there is anywhere near enough info to use this as evidence to justify the ex's stance. She might also just hate dogs, we don't know", "What info do you need?", "The kid knows there are multiple factors to getting a pet. In this case the factor was the mother.\n\n>you taught your kid that it's okay to blame others instead of taking responsibility.\n\nNope that was the ex. Swearing at OP and threatening court over a decision she previously held but now regrets because it leaves her open to criticism", "Minimum ESH because it would be on both the ex and OP to have explained why they aren't getting a dog. Explaining that initial decision isn't just OP's responsibility", "I'm confused by the backed it 100% part. His ex didn't want a dog. So he didnt get one because it would be unfair to her and to the dog, what other reasonable decision could he have made?", "Note the \"ex\" before wife. Just because the result was that there was no dog doesn't mean the decision was made together, nor that he backed it at all. It just means that he deciding fighting the point wasn't worth it when she said no. Her no could have been for a totally valid reason (she knew he wouldn't take care of it and didn't want yet another chore) or it could just be that she doesn't like dogs. But that's something she should have spoken to her son about when confronted instead of harassing OP about it.", "Pets are a 2 yeses one no situation. Any pet. But dogs more than most because they're a lot of work. So her No stopped the Pet. He backed her because that's how healthy relationships operate. People in a relationship should back eachother's decisions. He is no longer in a position where he is her teammate on this front and so can 100% say, I would have gotten a dog, but your Mom didn't want one.\n\nThe Mom should have owned this to her son long ago. That was her responsibility, and she failed to do so. Someday, if I have a kid, it will be made very clear their mother would have a dog, but I will not. I cannot live with them. I cannot handle the noise, the way they handle personal space, or the amount of work that goes into having a happy healthy dog. Because when I make a decision I should own the consequences.", "I\u2019m not sure on my vote here, because a lot depends on how he put things when speaking to his kid.  Setting that aside, I think some form of communicating this information was appropriate.\n\nHis son came to him thinking that he loved his younger children more because he was doing something for them that he didn\u2019t do for his older children.  Letting his older son know that there were other circumstances that prevented him getting a dog back then was important, because he needs to affirm to him that he loves him as much as his younger children.", "My kids already know damn well at 8 and 5 that if I get a pet, condo bylaws aside (cats only no other animals even though someone in our hall clearly has a bird) it was definitely my decision to do so and not something my STBXW would have allowed even if we had a house of our own. No bus throwing needed.", "Exactly.  That guy seems to have invented some scenario where the mother is the responsible adult and the father is an irresponsible idiot who wanted a dog despite it not being possible.  We have no reason to fabricate that reality.", "I mean... he was presumably single for a bit between the divorce and having a live-in partner again, so why didn't he get a dog then?", "True, that's why NTA. But I've only seen the work dumped on the wife, (numerous times) the other in theory is possible.", "How he said it. And possibly why she said no. Like did she say no because she was the stay at home parent and knew she\u2019d be doing all of the work taking care of the dog? Did she say no because she had a traumatic experience with a dog? How did he say it? There are ways to say things softly or ways to not be as kind.", ">That guy seems to have invented some scenario where the mother is the responsible adult and the father is an irresponsible idiot\n\nStick around here long enough and this sort of behaviour becomes common", "Well... I don't think that matters. The thing is, his wife reacted to how *their kid* told the story. OP could have been level-headed, but  the kid could have gone home and been snippy, aggressive, blaming, and that's not necessarily on the OP."]}
