You should have explained how it has to be a decision shared by both parents, it can\u2019t work otherwise, and that his mum\u2019s NTA either.", "If it's true NTA", "I don't know what the child custody laws are in your country, but in mine, if she were to take this story to court claiming \"parental alienation\", the judge would probably laugh at her. Especially if you could prove you were telling the truth. Family law courts here are for way more serious things than that.\n\nAnyway. If your son is still pissed at *you* rather than your wife (and let's face it, 15yos will always find *something* to be pissed at their parents about - it's in the job description), you can sympathize, and remind him that 50% of a dog now is better than no dog at all now. In other words: what's past is past, let's focus on the now, and half a dog is still pretty good.\n\nHe may even get more of the fun parts of dog ownership than you do (walks, games, etc) while you will get stuck more often with the less fun parts (feeding, middle of the night toileting, vet visits), so he's getting a pretty good deal.\n\nThen steer the conversation to the exact subject with which you began it: what kind of dog should we get?\n\nNTA.", "Depends on how you said it. Pets are a dual decision, not a 'your mother' decision. \n\nThere were ways to explain how your family lifestyle was different and therefore your ex-wife didn't feel that the family was equipped to take care of a dog correctly. There are ways to make it clear that you love your firstborn and you wanted a dog, but as a family there weren't ways to make it work back then. There are ways to affirm it isn't really fair without making it something that is pinned on someone as blame. That's N-T-A.\n\nAnd then there are ways that say \"Well *I* was always on *your* side, but unfortunately your mother is a controlling witch who wouldn't let us\". And that's YTA: its shifting blame instead of carrying it as a dual decision, and its trying to wash your hands of your own accountability by villainising the other parent.", "NTA.  Your son asked and you answered honestly.  That is *not* parental alienation. At least your son can have a goal for moving out, getting established and *then* getting as many dogs as he wants.\n\nYour son prolly unloaded on his mother and that is his mother's fault.  Not yours. \n\nTake the time to involve your son in caring for and training the new dog.  Let him feel as involved as he wants to be.", "NTA. At least she didn't deny it.", "Around Reddit, a bit of advice in couples relationships is \"two yes, one no.\" It's pretty smart: unless both partners agree, the no vote is an automatic veto. This can be anything from a child's name to a home purchase to getting a pet. \n\nYour ex is way in the wrong here. I'm so sorry.\n\nETA with judgment: NTA.", "NTA. Your son was upset because he believed you withheld something from him that you were giving to your younger son. You explained why. You didn\u2019t throw your ex under the bus\u2014she is free to explain why she didn\u2019t want a dog.", "If it\u2019s the truth she has no one to blame but herself .NTA", "NTA... if it was the truth. \nBUT often moms dont want a family dog because they get left with all the related work that is involved with caring for a pet. I've seen this first hand. They are often overwhelmed with looking after the kids and housework doing MORE then their share, then they get blamed for not wanting a dog. If that's the case. Be honest", "LOL! no, NTA. she didn't like being confronted with the consequences of her own choices, shocker.", "You bashed a parenting decision that was made *with* your ex (doesn't matter if she was the driving force, you were a *team* at the time) instead of addressing the actual issue with your child and explaining there are multiple factors involved in getting a family pet? Not to mention telling him that sulking because he didn't get something he wanted years ago shows a really bad attitude and that it's actively counterproductive to do that when he is finally *getting* what he wants?\n\nYeah, YTA. I'm sure throwing your ex under the bus felt good in the moment because it temporarily short-circuited your teen's complaints, but in the long run, you taught your kid that it's okay to blame others instead of taking responsibility. Not to mention that it's *really* bad to put a child of divorce in the middle of a conflict between the parents.\n\nI also should point out that you did absolutely nothing to address your teen's concerns that you like your new kid and new family better than him. Instead of reassuring him that *you* loved him, you made him feel like his mom didn't care about him either. Good going...", "I as a kid would know why one of my parents is against something. Why didn't he know that mom was against it until now? My mom would explain that decision to me. It would actually be a family conversation:\n\nMe: I want a dog.\nDad: Ok.\nMom: I don't think so. Who would take care of it? Who would train him? We don't have enough free time and money for a dog. \nMe: I understand \ud83d\ude14.\n\nEven if I would throw a hissy fit over it at that time, I would understand reasons as a teenager.\nNo matter how I see it, as a minimum  YTA for being a bad parent for not explaining your decisions to your kid and defaulting to blanket answer of \"no\". Otherwise mom's decision not having a dog when he was a child would not  come as a surprise now.\n\nEdid: word", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
