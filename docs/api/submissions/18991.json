If your son is still pissed at *you* rather than your wife (and let's face it, 15yos will always find *something* to be pissed at their parents about - it's in the job description), you can sympathize, and remind him that 50% of a dog now is better than no dog at all now. In other words: what's past is past, let's focus on the now, and half a dog is still pretty good.\n\nHe may even get more of the fun parts of dog ownership than you do (walks, games, etc) while you will get stuck more often with the less fun parts (feeding, middle of the night toileting, vet visits), so he's getting a pretty good deal.\n\nThen steer the conversation to the exact subject with which you began it: what kind of dog should we get?\n\nNTA.", "Depends on how you said it.

There are ways to affirm it isn't really fair without making it something that is pinned on someone as blame. That's N-T-A.\n\nAnd then there are ways that say \"Well *I* was always on *your* side, but unfortunately your mother is a controlling witch who wouldn't let us\".

I'm sure throwing your ex under the bus felt good in the moment because it temporarily short-circuited your teen's complaints, but in the long run, you taught your kid that it's okay to blame others instead of taking responsibility. Not to mention that it's *really* bad to put a child of divorce in the middle of a conflict between the parents.\n\nI also should point out that you did absolutely nothing to address your teen's concerns that you like your new kid and new family better than him.

Yes, it's important how OP phrased it originally... but in this scenario, mom is reacting to what *their son* told her. And we have no record of that. OP could have been a model of restrained grace, but if the son was all pissy when he got home, he could have lashed out at mom and framed things differently. Or just yelled at her.

OP would have nothing to do with that.", "Lots of times pet care also goes to the husbands too (especially the dirty or physical work).\n\nI don't think there is anywhere near enough info to use this as evidence to justify the ex's stance.

In this case the factor was the mother.\n\n>you taught your kid that it's okay to blame others instead of taking responsibility.\n\nNope that was the ex.

So he didnt get one because it would be unfair to her and to the dog, what other reasonable decision could he have made?", "Note the \"ex\" before wife. Just because the result was that there was no dog doesn't mean the decision was made together, nor that he backed it at all. It just means that he deciding fighting the point wasn't worth it when she said no. Her no could have been for a totally valid reason (she knew he wouldn't take care of it and didn't want yet another chore) or it could just be that she doesn't like dogs. But that's something she should have spoken to her son about when confronted instead of harassing OP about it.", "Pets are a 2 yeses one no situation. Any pet. But dogs more than most because they're a lot of work. So her No stopped the Pet. He backed her because that's how healthy relationships operate. People in a relationship should back eachother's decisions. He is no longer in a position where he is her teammate on this front and so can 100% say, I would have gotten a dog, but your Mom didn't want one.\n\nThe Mom should have owned this to her son long ago. That was her responsibility, and she failed to do so. Someday, if I have a kid, it will be made very clear their mother would have a dog, but I will not. I cannot live with them. I cannot handle the noise, the way they handle personal space, or the amount of work that goes into having a happy healthy dog. Because when I make a decision I should own the consequences.", "I\u2019m not sure on my vote here, because a lot depends on how he put things when speaking to his kid.  Setting that aside, I think some form of communicating this information was appropriate.\n\nHis son came to him thinking that he loved his younger children more because he was doing something for them that he didn\u2019t do for his older children.  Letting his older son know that there were other circumstances that prevented him getting a dog back then was important, because he needs to affirm to him that he loves him as much as his younger children.", "My kids already know damn well at 8 and 5 that if I get a pet, condo bylaws aside (cats only no other animals even though someone in our hall clearly has a bird) it was definitely my decision to do so and not something my STBXW would have allowed even if we had a house of our own.

That guy seems to have invented some scenario where the mother is the responsible adult and the father is an irresponsible idiot who wanted a dog despite it not being possible.  We have no reason to fabricate that reality.", "I mean... he was presumably single for a bit between the divorce and having a live-in partner again, so why didn't he get a dog then?", "True, that's why NTA. But I've only seen the work dumped on the wife, (numerous times) the other in theory is possible.", "How he said it. And possibly why she said no. Like did she say no because she was the stay at home parent and knew she\u2019d be doing all of the work taking care of the dog? Did she say no because she had a traumatic experience with a dog? How did he say it? There are ways to say things softly or ways to not be as kind.", ">That guy seems to have invented some scenario where the mother is the responsible adult and the father is an irresponsible idiot\n\nStick around here long enough and this sort of behaviour becomes common", "Well... I don't think that matters. The thing is, his wife reacted to how *their kid* told the story. OP could have been level-headed, but  the kid could have gone home and been snippy, aggressive, blaming, and that's not necessarily on the OP.", "Honestly there\u2019s not enough info here to say, but my older brother also wanted a dog his whole childhood. He finally got one, when he was a junior in high school.  The mixture of excitement and disappointment he had is something I\u2019ll never forget.  Your son is probably smart enough to realize beyond the 50% of the time issue, he\u2019ll probably have even less time with it in his upcoming college years. Even more that that, really you\u2019re getting a dog, not him.  It\u2019s perfectly understandable he\u2019s upset, and you have opportunities here for better parenting in the future if you take more time to consider things from all of your children\u2019s perspectives.", "When I was 9 my dad brought home a dog. My mom was furious. A short year later my dad's affair came to light and my parents broke up leaving her with not only me to care for but a dog she never consented to. I couldn't see it at the time but by bringing home the dog the way he did he was a \"hero\" while my mom was the \"villian\". My dad never really helped care for the dog it was my mom. Granted he grew on her over time but still. As an adult I get why she was so irritated and it was valid. \n\nMaybe your ex didn't want a dog because she didn't want more responsibility. Getting a dog is a big choice. And when kids are little a puppy added to the mix is utter chaos. Pets are also very expensive. \n\nRegardless instead of addressing your son's real concern that you prefer your new son over him you pointed him to your ex. You may not be married but you're still a team when it comes to raising your son. You made it a her vs me instead of a we problem. \n\nI think there is a lot of missing information here. I also think you have your concerns out of order. Instead of wondering if your ex is right about you being an asshole maybe you should worry more about why your son feels like he's second class.", "You didn't throw her under the bus, you gave him the truthful explanation that he needed. And yes he did need it, because it was leading to feelings of not being loved.\n\nAnd nothing about what you said implied his mom doesn't love him, so you weren't transferring the \"you don't like me\" thing onto him---just means she doesn't want/like dogs.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your son brought up an issue, you answered him honestly. Did your ex want you to lie to him?", "You could do it differently going forward.  It's not always as clear as black and white, right and wrong \n\nWhy not say \"we didn't feel it was right for our family back then\" or something that does not lay blame?", "NTA glad she's your ex... Yikes \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude33", "100%. I get why my mom was so angry when my dad randomly brought home a dog he found. Looking back I can say my mom got all the work associated with him. My dad got to be the hero of the moment and my mom was the villian when she was just honest that her hands were full and I was not responsible enough to care for the dog alone. \n\nWe don't have a dog anymore but when we did all of his care fell to me and he made a lot of extra work for me alone because I am a SAHM. Disagree about only husband getting the dirty work as another user commented. I scrubbed poop out of carpet plenty. Cleaned his muddy paws after walks. Poop scooped. Etc. We currently have cats. Their care falls on me. At least cats are easier and as much as I love those fuzzballs I sometimes get resentful that I'm the one doing all the work despite these being \"family pets\". I  comfort myself with knowing that they know who takes care of them and that I'm the one they mostly snuggle and sleep with. It's part of having pets and usually one parent is more committed than the other despite whether the decision to obtain the pet was mutual.", "Her choice not to get a dog wasn't wrong or a bad choice.", "Yeah that was my big problem too. I felt like OP just missed that his real issue is how his son feels about his importance in his father's life and how he fits in the new family unit OP chose to create. \n\nThe ex told him it wasn't the first time he's thrown her under the bus. He does nothing to refute or give any examples of past coparenting. He doesn't paint a good picture at all. Did she handle it the best? Nope. But I get the feeling he didn't either. Both parents are capable of being in the wrong so to speak here. \n\nAnd I was that kid thrown in the middle. Watching my parents have full on screaming matches at public places while they swapped me out like an object. \"Your mom...\" \"Your dad...\" it was always something.", "You need to separate Y T A or it counts it as a vote", "Idk about them but I want to know if it's true that it was actually the mom saying no. Is anyone else also wondering why, like does she not like dogs, I just want to know everything.", ">The kid knows there are multiple factors to getting a pet\n\nWhich part of the OP's post indicated that the kid knows that? Because the way I read it, *OP* thinks the only factor involved was his ex's decision... And if *he* thinks that was the only factor, that's the message he passed onto his kid.\n\nIf OP had acknowledged the multiple factors (e.g. \"In order to get a family pet, everyone in the family has to agree that it's a good idea and there needs to be plans in place to take care of it. That wasn't something your mother and I were able to come to an agreement about, so it wasn't an option, even though I would have liked to have one...being part of a family means you need to take everyone's needs into account\"), I would not have judged him an AH.\n\nI don't care about the ex's call or the ex's opinion of OP's behavior. My judgement was based on the OP being an AH to his kid. \n\nAnd I don't care if I get downvoted on posts like these: I will continue to defend children of divorce from their parents' AH-ish behavior and attempts to put them in the middle. It is an AH move to blame your ex instead of properly parenting your kids.
