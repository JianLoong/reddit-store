It makes sense that you didn't know how much the bird would love spinach and demand it.  At this point, your dad will have to work with the parrot to re-train her so that she doesn't constantly demand her favourite snack.  It's also worth noting that a healthy diet for parrots does include leafy greens so your dad might need to adjust his perception in order to give the bird enough greens in her diet.", "NTA, its not your fault that the bird is Popeye.", "You dad owns a parrot and he didn't know it might learn words and repeatedly screech them? \n\nYou're NTA.

I'm sure he can replace it with another word by doing the same thing you did. \n\nAs a side note, I think it's a little sad to leave a pet for 5 months. I mean, why have a pet if you're going to be gone for almost half the year?", "NTA\n\nIf it wasn't this word, it was bound to be another word.", "Quality content.

We can't even say the word in his presence..", "Would the re-training involve bringing Birdy\u2019s least-favourite food every time it demands spinach? Or some other thing it finds gross?\n\nOr will that just make Birdy start yelling \u201cNO SPINACH\u201d randomly?", "LMFAO!", "hahahahaha", "I wonder how well dad cares for this bird that it only knew two words. The parrots I know, as well as other types of birds, all have multiple words in their vocabulary, but that\u2019s because the owners interact with them a lot and teach them.

This was his vocabulary - Hello. Love you. Here kitty kitty. Gimmie kiss (followed by a kissing sound). Goodbye. Peekaboo (which he would play by going under the paper at the bottom of his cage).

OP's pet is probably being ignored unless gets very loud.", "Then, whatever the gross thing is, which Birdy hates, and responds to by yelling F YOU, you give a bit of to visitors X \u201cThis is my parrot Birdy - take him a bit of this if you like, it\u2019s their favourite treat.\u201d\n\nOff goes the visitor like \u201cHello Birdy, want to have this treatie?\u201d And Birdy screams FUCK YOU", "NTA That's actually adorable. \n\nI was tasked with feeding a neighbours dog for two weeks while they were away. Every time I opened the gate, their dog would bark at me. They were not impressed to hear their parrot screech \"Fuck off dog\" every time they opened the gate. Oops.", "NTA and it made me think back to two stories my dad told: \n\nmy parents neighbors used to have a Beo (also a talking bird like a parrot but smaller and not colourful). Except that one didn't talk but liked imitating sounds instead, like you would suddenly hear really loud screeching like a train coming to a stop out of the living room. The neighbor is someone who talks a lot,  even to herself. Once when they were on vacation my dad was feeding the bird - and my dad does not talk a lot especially not to himself. The bird, being used to hearing it's caregiver approach, literally fell off his perch in shock (as told by my dad) when he suddenly appeared in front of it's cage. My dad was worried he had hurt the bird, but he was fine and afterwards my dad started announcing himself lol. \n\nThe same neighbors also used to have guinea pigs (not at the same time as the bird, they've been living nextdoor to my parents for more than 20 years) which my dad also fed once. My dad peeled the cucumber before giving it to them, just thinking that's how it should be done. After the neighbors had returned, he learned that the guinea pigs had indeed not only never had their cucumber peeled before, but that they also refused to eat it with the peel afterwards even tho they had always done so happily. My dad inadvertently spoiled them and made the neighbor think they were sick because they stopped eating xD. The neighbor was not really angry, maybe a bit annoyed but all while joking about it.", "Waiting for the update where the parrot orders spinach from the dad's Alexa lmao.

You can try to teach a parrot many, many words, but they will ultimately learn what they want to learn. When you own a parrot that has speaking skills, you know that it\u2019s going to repeat some words a lot more than you\u2019d like it to, and that\u2019s just part of owning a parrot.
