She was already able to say 'Morning' and 'Night' at the appropriate times but has not yet learned to make a request/demand.

Had no idea she would love this particular food so much. Now she screams 'Spinach! Spinach!

It makes sense that you didn't know how much the bird would love spinach and demand it.  At this point, your dad will have to work with the parrot to re-train her so that she doesn't constantly demand her favourite snack.  It's also worth noting that a healthy diet for parrots does include leafy greens so your dad might need to adjust his perception in order to give the bird enough greens in her diet.", "NTA, its not your fault that the bird is Popeye.", "You dad owns a parrot and he didn't know it might learn words and repeatedly screech them? \n\nYou're NTA. He can teach her some new words and be glad you didn't teach her some more colorful ones.", "NTA for teaching the parrot a word or giving him things he likes to eat, especially since it it good for him.\n\nHowever, he needs to learn not to screech for it. Please help your Dad teach the parrot that he gets spinach by asking nicely.", "NTA\n\nDad needs to put less time into other things and more time into training his parrot.  Teach her two dozen behaviors and two dozen more words about anything and she won\u2019t focus on spinach as her only pleasure in life.", "NTA. It\u2019s a parrot. If he doesn\u2019t want a talking bird, why on earth would he get a parrot?", "NTA \n\nI actually find it hilarious!!!\n\nI suppose you should have asked him before you taught the bird to say it but what's done is done. I'm sure he can replace it with another word by doing the same thing you did. \n\nAs a side note, I think it's a little sad to leave a pet for 5 months. I mean, why have a pet if you're going to be gone for almost half the year?", "NTA\n\nIf it wasn't this word, it was bound to be another word.", "Quality content. NTA", "NTA, my parrot mimics a commercial fire alarm at up to 90 decibels when he's angry which fyi, is enough to cause hearing damage over time. Your dad should be happy \"Spinach!\" is all his bird does because my bird can be PAINFUL.", "no, he shouldn't have talking bird if no want talk to, good is bird", "lmao!!! \n\nNTA\n\nThis is hilarious! But I kinda get where your dad is coming from. That shit would annoy the hell out of me if I had to hear that all the time.", "he has a parrot. a smart animal. that can talk and learn what the human words mean. what the hell did he expect his parrot to do???? literally one of the reasons I won't ever get a parrot even tho i think theyre cool as fuck, bc they *talk and talk and talk and talk*, he demanding a specifc food is one of those ways parrots talk. you had her for FIVE months. NTA, im not sure what ur father expected from an intelligent animal", "You didn't know the parrot would develop a spinach addiction, but once you did, you should have discouraged it rather than reinforce it, as yes, it would be annoying to have a demanding bird.

We can't even say the word in his presence..", "Would the re-training involve bringing Birdy\u2019s least-favourite food every time it demands spinach? Or some other thing it finds gross?\n\nOr will that just make Birdy start yelling \u201cNO SPINACH\u201d randomly?", "LMFAO!", "hahahahaha", "I wonder how well dad cares for this bird that it only knew two words. The parrots I know, as well as other types of birds, all have multiple words in their vocabulary, but that\u2019s because the owners interact with them a lot and teach them.

This was his vocabulary - Hello. Love you. Here kitty kitty. Gimmie kiss (followed by a kissing sound). Goodbye. Peekaboo (which he would play by going under the paper at the bottom of his cage). Hey turkey. And he would whistle the Addams Family theme song chorus and various other songs. OP's pet is probably being ignored unless gets very loud.", "Then, whatever the gross thing is, which Birdy hates, and responds to by yelling F YOU, you give a bit of to visitors X \u201cThis is my parrot Birdy - take him a bit of this if you like, it\u2019s their favourite treat.\u201d\n\nOff goes the visitor like \u201cHello Birdy, want to have this treatie?\u201d And Birdy screams FUCK YOU"]}
