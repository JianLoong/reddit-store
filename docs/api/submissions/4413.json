We have been friends since high school (we are both 30). \n\n\nAt first she was very optimistic and took the process in stride, but over the past 3 years she became increasingly angry, depressed, and somewhat hostile towards those of us in the friend group with children.\n\n\nLast year I was pregnant with my first child. During this time, Jane basically went no contact with me. The few times I saw her, she would grimace or roll her eyes when I touched my belly or accidentally made a comment in passing about the pregnancy. I was really miserable while I was pregnant, so it hurt not to have her support, but at the same time I somewhat understood. She did not come to my baby shower, and only met the baby in passing when my friends came over to pick me up for a night out. She didn\u2019t even want to hold him.\n\n\nThings really came to a head when I sent a Christmas card last year to her with my family on it. I didn\u2019t really think anything of it, just sent one to the people that were important to me.\nJane was not a fan of this. As soon as she got the card, she called me and snapped that she thought she made it clear she wasn\u2019t interested in the baby and that I was just shoving her infertility in her face and mocking her. She said she couldn\u2019t stand how I was flaunting how fast I conceived and my pregnancy everywhere and she couldn\u2019t take it anymore.\n\n\nI was shocked and hurt. I hadn\u2019t tried to flaunt, sure I posted about my pregnancy on social media and sent some pictures and updates to the group chat, but I was just excited about everything. After this, we did not talk for months, just the occasional update in the group chat.\n\n\nJane is now about six months pregnant with her child. She has been absolutely spamming the group chat with every little update about her pregnancy. I have generally ignored them, just giving the occasional encouraging word. \nLast week, we got an invitation to Jane\u2019s baby shower. I felt uncomfortable going, plus my husband was going to be out of town and no one could watch our son.\n\n\nI called Jane and said unfortunately we wouldn\u2019t be able to make it, but I would send a card. This time she really blew up on me, yelling and crying that I can\u2019t just be happy for her and have to make everything about me. She said she couldn\u2019t help how she acted about my pregnancy because she was so miserable, but that she\u2019s trying to make amends. I told her she hasn\u2019t even asked to come over to see my son and hung up.\n\n\nMy friends are saying I\u2019m an ass and it\u2019s not Jane\u2019s fault how she acted while I was pregnant. My husband said I\u2019m being petty and should just go.

It sounds like you have been a supportive friend to Jane throughout her struggles with infertility, and it is understandable that you would be hurt by her negative reaction to your pregnancy. It is not your responsibility to constantly put aside your own feelings and make concessions for her, especially if she is not showing you the same level of empathy and understanding. It is okay for you to set boundaries and prioritize your own well-being and that of your family. It is not petty or unfair to decline an invitation to a baby shower if you do not feel comfortable attending. It is also not necessary for you to constantly engage with Jane's updates about her pregnancy if it makes you uncomfortable. You are allowed to take care of yourself and prioritize your own happiness.", "Yikes, NTA.

This is just hypocrisy at it's finest.", ">I told her she hasn\u2019t even asked to come over to see my son and hung up.\n\nThis is what seals it for me. Look, I've struggled with infertility and I have had to distance myself from some of my pregnant friends during the pain of that struggle (and gently explained that I needed a bit of space, which they were more than happy to oblige with). \n\nBut the fact that she has gotten through that struggle and hasn't even bothered to try to meet your kid is not ok. She clearly is very self-focused and doesn't actually view you as much of a friend.\n\nIf you sit back and reflect on your friendship, I'm guessing you're more of a giver and she's more of a taker? Maybe this friendship has run its course.\n\nNTA", "My wife and I had infertility for 3+ years and dealt with a ton, and not a single time did I ever see her treat her friends with anything but excitement and admiration.

That is your answer on whether or not to continue being in her life.", "Your telling me that she knows how she acted and instead of being an adult and talking to you about she's trying to invite you to the very things she skipped out on.... This woman is kinda unreal, seems like she expects everyone to match whatever she's got going on at the expense of your feelings. NTA maybe go out for lunch or something to talk someday", "NTA her infertility journey had nothing to do with you. For her to treat you like that and not give an apology afterwards is just plain nasty. She isn\u2019t your friend", "NTA. It's very hard and I feel for her if she had stepped back for a bit that's one thing. She acted like what you did was a personal affront during a very stressful transition in your life and you did your best to give her that space even if she didn't directly ask for it. She made it known how she felt. \n\nThe fact that she now expects that you will reciprocate anything when she gave you nothing and tbh sounded downright cruel. . .and not like a friend at all. And if anything in my culture that is not the energy you want when you are carrying a little one. Not good for you or the little being you're carrying. \n\nAnd the fact that she became hostile to the others with kids in the group? Is not okay. When as an adult she could have been the one to take a step back instead of being jealous and cruel.\n\nI don't like how everyone is gaslighting you when you did nothing wrong. You felt uncomfortable going after the petty immature way she behaved toward you. It is her fault. She's grown. \n\nHow long was she trying to make amends and would they have been made if she was NEVER able to get pregnant? \n\nDid she make an honest true apology? With words? Or are you being expected to accept that now that she is going to have a baby/what she wants that now you can pick up where you left off without her taking real responsibility for her actions?\n\nIs this the first time she has been like this? \n\nEither way, in my mind from what you told me that isn't a friend.

Sometimes people feel uncomfortable holding kids, and I imagine that for some struggling with infertility, that discomfort is magnified, albeit for separate reasons. At the time she didn't think she'd ever have her own kid to hold, so handing your kid back to you would have felt pretty lousy I imagine. \n\nThat aside, she's been incredibly unkind to you and you're not wrong for feeling uncomfortable.

No. But certainly would be happy for you and send you at least a card even if I was still sad for me.

You can be pregnant at the same time as someone and one couple loses the baby and it's horrible for the other couple to have milestones along the way of what they could have had.\n\nBut your friends should be friends during good and bad. She was not your friend during your hard times so how can she magically expect the reverse?", "NTA. I do think in general we can be more sensitive to people who are struggling with anything, including infertility, but she's being over the top with it. \n\nHave any of your friends lost a parent yet? Are you not allowed to talk about your parents around that friend, because you have parents and they don't? If your friend had to put their dog down, would you not be allowed to talk about your dog for the rest of eternity? Shit happens. Sometimes life sucks. If you want to keep friends, you need to be able to deal with these things without sucking the enjoyment and celebration out of everyone else's life in the process.\n\nIf she needs to cut herself off from you to protect her mental health, I think it would be nice for you to understand where she's coming from and give her the space she needs, don't hold it against her, and hope that things get better in the future. That's kind of the limit of what I'd expect a good friend to do. To not allow you to be happy with your pregnancy or your baby until and unless she can have her own is really entitled and self-centered. \n\nIt's maybe a little petty of you to not go to her shower. Like I said, I'd hope that you'd be able to not hold her behavior against her and would look for opportunities for things to improve between you in the future, and you're kind of blowing that opportunity off. But that doesn't necessarily make you TA.

And I alway owned my behaviour saying \u201cI can\u2019t face this today\u201d. \n\nBut I never yelled at anyone for giving me a family card at Xmas or having their kids! \n\nJane is probably pretty self centered as a whole and OP should look back on the relationship and see what the tells were. \n\nI know I did not lose friends because before this I was a normal friend and tried to keep my misery as private as possible and 100% never blamed anyone else even though I often wanted to crawl under a rock and hibernate through someone\u2019s pregnancy.", "Oh absolutely - I hope I didn't come across as contradicting you. I agree entirely. I actually told as few people as I could about it while I was doing it because I didn't want to constantly be rehashing the whole thing. I didn't feel it was healthy for anybody!\n\nMy takeaway on it is definitely that this is saying something about Jane as a person, rather than Jane's experiences.  Jane is playing the victim here because OP's attention is not abject enough. And that's what she did prior to getting pregnant, too. The star of the show, how dare everyone not acknowledge it, basically, no matter the situation. If OP allows it to continue, then it will be Jane as the new mom, tired and cranky and blowing up because nobody recognizes how much she's struggling about that, next.", "No i felt you were agreeing with me! \n\nIt is just \u201cnice\u201d when someone else understands how unnatural and challenging IVF is. \n\nI really didn\u2019t expect it to be such an emotional rollercoaster and soul destroying experience. \n\nI have moved it past it now though.", "Jane will the rainbow baby mother who expects their kid to never be disciplined and allowed to attend every adult event and be fawned over by the masses", "I was one of the fortunate ones in that I now have living children as a result of it. However, I could never do it again after all the failed as well as successful attempts. I won't unpack it all here of course, but yes, I understand.\n\nMy partner kind of wanted one more and I had to tell them I couldn't do it again, we were done. I can understand how it would significantly challenge many people.", "Probably.

I know this because I'm on a few different meds to make my brain mimic a \"normal\" humans.  I still try to make amends whenever I make an ass out of myself because of my issues.  Her decisions were hers.  She chose to act like that, she chose to respond like that, and she chose to not even attempt to fix it until she wanted something from you.  Why would you want a person like that in your life?", "\"Jane, you are way too much work. Got that? Other people have feelings and needs and you haven't been very supportive of me.

I have suffered from infertility for 6 years and I can honestly say, it\u2019s the hardest, most heartbreaking thing to be happy for someone else while dying a little inside when they announce a pregnancy.

I couldn't bring myself to attend baby showers either, but I was never nasty to them.", "NTA to be quite frank she can fuck right off. She\u2019s selfish and wants everyone else to be walking on tightropes through her waves of erratic and extreme emotions. True friends would be happy for you, if space were needed they would communicate like adults and not be total jack offs about it. It benefits her now to have your support but you owe her absolutely nothing OP. You teach people how to treat you, I hope she learns from this. You aren\u2019t being petty, if you were then where was this energy when you were pregnant and wanted support from her? So hubby is wrong, you aren\u2019t petty.
