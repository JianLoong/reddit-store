We have been friends since high school (we are both 30). \n\n\nAt first she was very optimistic and took the process in stride, but over the past 3 years she became increasingly angry, depressed, and somewhat hostile towards those of us in the friend group with children.\n\n\nLast year I was pregnant with my first child. During this time, Jane basically went no contact with me. The few times I saw her, she would grimace or roll her eyes when I touched my belly or accidentally made a comment in passing about the pregnancy. I was really miserable while I was pregnant, so it hurt not to have her support, but at the same time I somewhat understood. She did not come to my baby shower, and only met the baby in passing when my friends came over to pick me up for a night out. She didn\u2019t even want to hold him.\n\n\nThings really came to a head when I sent a Christmas card last year to her with my family on it. I didn\u2019t really think anything of it, just sent one to the people that were important to me.\nJane was not a fan of this. As soon as she got the card, she called me and snapped that she thought she made it clear she wasn\u2019t interested in the baby and that I was just shoving her infertility in her face and mocking her. She said she couldn\u2019t stand how I was flaunting how fast I conceived and my pregnancy everywhere and she couldn\u2019t take it anymore.\n\n\nI was shocked and hurt. I hadn\u2019t tried to flaunt, sure I posted about my pregnancy on social media and sent some pictures and updates to the group chat, but I was just excited about everything. After this, we did not talk for months, just the occasional update in the group chat.\n\n\nJane is now about six months pregnant with her child. She has been absolutely spamming the group chat with every little update about her pregnancy. I have generally ignored them, just giving the occasional encouraging word. \nLast week, we got an invitation to Jane\u2019s baby shower. I felt uncomfortable going, plus my husband was going to be out of town and no one could watch our son.\n\n\nI called Jane and said unfortunately we wouldn\u2019t be able to make it, but I would send a card. This time she really blew up on me, yelling and crying that I can\u2019t just be happy for her and have to make everything about me. She said she couldn\u2019t help how she acted about my pregnancy because she was so miserable, but that she\u2019s trying to make amends. I told her she hasn\u2019t even asked to come over to see my son and hung up.\n\n\nMy friends are saying I\u2019m an ass and it\u2019s not Jane\u2019s fault how she acted while I was pregnant. My husband said I\u2019m being petty and should just go.

It sounds like you have been a supportive friend to Jane throughout her struggles with infertility, and it is understandable that you would be hurt by her negative reaction to your pregnancy. It is not your responsibility to constantly put aside your own feelings and make concessions for her, especially if she is not showing you the same level of empathy and understanding. It is okay for you to set boundaries and prioritize your own well-being and that of your family. It is not petty or unfair to decline an invitation to a baby shower if you do not feel comfortable attending. It is also not necessary for you to constantly engage with Jane's updates about her pregnancy if it makes you uncomfortable. You are allowed to take care of yourself and prioritize your own happiness.", "Yikes, NTA. I would say it's time to move on from this friendship before it completely drains you.", "NTA. it IS Jane\u2019s fault how she reacted. Seems to me she\u2019s the one making it all about herself. She\u2019s not trying to make amends. Did she even apologize for her behavior? Honestly she sounds self absorbed. You aren\u2019t being petty by not going. You didn\u2019t say anything mean. You are just protecting yourself.", "NTA. No way. This is just hypocrisy at it's finest.", ">I told her she hasn\u2019t even asked to come over to see my son and hung up.\n\nThis is what seals it for me. Look, I've struggled with infertility and I have had to distance myself from some of my pregnant friends during the pain of that struggle (and gently explained that I needed a bit of space, which they were more than happy to oblige with). \n\nBut the fact that she has gotten through that struggle and hasn't even bothered to try to meet your kid is not ok. She clearly is very self-focused and doesn't actually view you as much of a friend.\n\nIf you sit back and reflect on your friendship, I'm guessing you're more of a giver and she's more of a taker? Maybe this friendship has run its course.\n\nNTA", "My wife and I had infertility for 3+ years and dealt with a ton, and not a single time did I ever see her treat her friends with anything but excitement and admiration.

She gets all mad and insane on YOU for being happy about being pregnant, and now that she\u2019s pregnant and you don\u2019t WORSHIP her, she says you can\u2019t be happy for her. \n\nShe needs a reality check and an attitude adjustment. The world doesn\u2019t revolve around her.\n\nI\u2019d cut her off. No one needs this negativity in their life. \n\nAnd: NTA obviously", "Nta- It was your first child. It should have been a happy time for for and she was being the AH for treating you like it was your fault for her not being pregnant.\n\nI do understand it must have been a very hard time for her, but it doesn't give her an excuse to be a horrible friend.  \n\nI don't think you are being petty or the AH. How you are feeling about it all is valid.  She made it clear she wasn't interested in being your friend.", "NTA. This woman is selfish and toxic. Apparently it\u2019s okay for her to treat you however she wants but you must also treat her however she wants. Sounds like a nasty, self centered person.", "NTA.  Time to reassess your \u201cfriendship. \u201c. Has she called specifically to apologize to you?  That is your answer on whether or not to continue being in her life.", "Your telling me that she knows how she acted and instead of being an adult and talking to you about she's trying to invite you to the very things she skipped out on.... This woman is kinda unreal, seems like she expects everyone to match whatever she's got going on at the expense of your feelings. NTA maybe go out for lunch or something to talk someday", "NTA her infertility journey had nothing to do with you. For her to treat you like that and not give an apology afterwards is just plain nasty. She isn\u2019t your friend", "NTA. It's very hard and I feel for her if she had stepped back for a bit that's one thing. She acted like what you did was a personal affront during a very stressful transition in your life and you did your best to give her that space even if she didn't directly ask for it. She made it known how she felt. \n\nThe fact that she now expects that you will reciprocate anything when she gave you nothing and tbh sounded downright cruel. . .and not like a friend at all. And if anything in my culture that is not the energy you want when you are carrying a little one. Not good for you or the little being you're carrying. \n\nAnd the fact that she became hostile to the others with kids in the group? Is not okay. When as an adult she could have been the one to take a step back instead of being jealous and cruel.\n\nI don't like how everyone is gaslighting you when you did nothing wrong. You felt uncomfortable going after the petty immature way she behaved toward you. It is her fault. She's grown. \n\nHow long was she trying to make amends and would they have been made if she was NEVER able to get pregnant? \n\nDid she make an honest true apology? With words? Or are you being expected to accept that now that she is going to have a baby/what she wants that now you can pick up where you left off without her taking real responsibility for her actions?\n\nIs this the first time she has been like this? \n\nEither way, in my mind from what you told me that isn't a friend.

Jane needs therapy.", "NTA\n\nThis is not a friendship and hasn\u2019t been for a long time. The way Jane has been behaving towards you sucks. The fact that she wasn\u2019t there at all for you during your pregnancy and hasn\u2019t even bothered to meet your child says it all. \n\nI would now block her on everything and move on.

It does not excuse her behavior, or erase the hurt she caused you.", "NTA she still hasn't met your kid yet expect you to go to a baby shower dump her now she a  toxic person and the whole I can't get pregnant quick doesn't mean that you have a  right to be  an AH because you suffering", "\"She didn\u2019t even want to hold him.\"\n\nThis on its own is not necessarily an AH thing to do. Sometimes people feel uncomfortable holding kids, and I imagine that for some struggling with infertility, that discomfort is magnified, albeit for separate reasons. At the time she didn't think she'd ever have her own kid to hold, so handing your kid back to you would have felt pretty lousy I imagine. \n\nThat aside, she's been incredibly unkind to you and you're not wrong for feeling uncomfortable.

She can't be abusive to you then expect your support. \nShe hasn't even bothered to meet your child. \nShame on her. \nEven after experiencing a traumatic miscarriage I was able to be happy for friends and family who got pregnant.

She was an absolute ass to you during your pregnancy and does not deserve your support now.", "NTA, I know what it's like to go through infertility for multiple years, it's hard. Even in the hardest parts of my grief after miscarriage I couldn't have been this cold to someone I considered my friend. Would I be super involved in your pregnancy? No. But certainly would be happy for you and send you at least a card even if I was still sad for me. She can't have it both ways. \n\nI agree sending a card and not really being involved is the civil thing to do here after all that. You chose to be kinder than a lot of people.", "Ugh! \n\nYes, it's awful that she had such a hard time conceiving, but that's not on you. You don't deserve to be mistreated like this.\n\nYou're not obligated to set yourself on fire to keep others warm", "NTA. \"It's not Jane's fault\" well I'm assuming that she's of sound mind and judgement so I don't see anyone else's fault it could be.", "NTA. Clearly Jane has had a hard time conceiving - however she is an adult who can control her own behaviour and should know when she is being inappropriate or hurtful to those she cares for. She cant expect you to be very happy and attend your baby shower when she was so rude to you. She could have sat you down and explained how hard of a time she was having with you being pregnant etc but instead she blew up at you.", "Like I said in another thread, get new friends. Because Jane had no right to treat you like shit then expect you to be ok with everything. Your friends are A Hs for enabling this and your husband needs to stfu. You\u2019re entitled to feel the way you feel considering no one had your back and still don\u2019t. \n\nHave a serious discussion with your husband so he can be on your side. NTA.", "NTA. She chose to be horrible to you. It's not petty to not want anything to do with her. Like they say, \"when people show you who they are, believe them\". And her yelling and screaming when you told her you couldn't make it only further shows she hasn't changed at all.", "NTA - pregnancy has risks and horrible things come with it. You can be pregnant at the same time as someone and one couple loses the baby and it's horrible for the other couple to have milestones along the way of what they could have had.\n\nBut your friends should be friends during good and bad. She was not your friend during your hard times so how can she magically expect the reverse?", "NTA. I do think in general we can be more sensitive to people who are struggling with anything, including infertility, but she's being over the top with it. \n\nHave any of your friends lost a parent yet? Are you not allowed to talk about your parents around that friend, because you have parents and they don't? If your friend had to put their dog down, would you not be allowed to talk about your dog for the rest of eternity? Shit happens. Sometimes life sucks. If you want to keep friends, you need to be able to deal with these things without sucking the enjoyment and celebration out of everyone else's life in the process.\n\nIf she needs to cut herself off from you to protect her mental health, I think it would be nice for you to understand where she's coming from and give her the space she needs, don't hold it against her, and hope that things get better in the future. That's kind of the limit of what I'd expect a good friend to do. To not allow you to be happy with your pregnancy or your baby until and unless she can have her own is really entitled and self-centered. \n\nIt's maybe a little petty of you to not go to her shower. Like I said, I'd hope that you'd be able to not hold her behavior against her and would look for opportunities for things to improve between you in the future, and you're kind of blowing that opportunity off. But that doesn't necessarily make you TA. Maybe that just means that either you've changed and she's changed and this just isn't someone you really want to be friends with anymore, and that's another shitty part of life too.", "There was a similar post several months ago. She does not sound like a very good friend. I know plenty of people that go through all kinds of things but they do not blame the people that are supporting them.\n\nI recommend sending a single text that explains while you understand she was hurting she took out her frustrations on you and in the process unfairly hurt you when you were trying your best to be sensitive to her feelings. She cannot now expect you to forget that hurt that she caused when you did your best to be there for her throughout the past several years. Then explain that you will be going either No or very Low Contact based on how you see fit given the way that she's treated you. NTA", "NTA.

She says she is trying to make amends, but has not come to apologize in person or meet your son? Bye Felicia.", "NTA. \n\nIt is absolutely Jane's fault for how she behaved during your pregnancy and don't let anyone tell you any different. \n\nI lost four pregnancies in a variety of traumatic circumstances and was told I would never be a Mum naturally. Was I devastated? Hell yes! Did I take it out on pregnant friends and family? Not once. Which meant that when I did eventually have my daughter with my fifth pregnancy I had friends and family left in my life to be happy for me.", "NTA but I think it's time to accept that this friendship has run its course and both of you need to move on.

Yes, people have infertility issues but guess what you suck it up buttercup and support your friends. \n\nYou may find it hard and are not present for everything like your shower but you\u2019re still supportive. If you hadn\u2019t given her that Xmas card, I swear she\u2019d had blown up for not receiving one.

Your response to your trauma is your responsibility, and does not give you and excuse to be an asshole or to burn bridges\".  \n\nYou are responsible for everything you do.  Regardless of whether or not she was hurting, or miserable, she acted immaturely and now, she expects you to let it go because 'I was miserable?'  \n\nNot the way this works unfortunately.", "Yes as per this comment, please continue to protect yourself OP. Really recommend cutting out this toxic person", "Yep exactly. It\u2019s her problem not OP\u2019s", "She didn't change though or apologized. She is an awful friend. OP should leave this friendship in the past.", "It sounds like her body has been flooded with weird hormones for three years.
