My aunt and cousin were living with my grandfather but my dad was given power of attorney. My dad hired nurses to take care of him during the day. My sister and I were still in high school but we lived 1.4 miles away so after school we would relieve the nurses for a few hours until my dad got home for work. A year after my grandfather's stroke, my mother had a brain aneurysm and stroke herself. My dad gave power of attorney to his sister to focus on my mom's care. \n\nUnbeknownst to us my aunt and cousin began bad mouthing my father, sister and I, saying we were neglecting my grandfather not visiting etc which was not true, I would call and talk to my grandfather at least once a week but couldn't see him because I no longer lived in the city because of college and my sister still visited almost daily.\n\nSince she had power of attorney she somehow convinced my grandfather and other relatives we no longer cared for him and had my grandfather's will changed so everything he owned, went to her when he died. She sold everything except the house he lived in. We got nothing, not even family albums with our pictures in it.  \n\nA few years later our relatives saw for themselves how greedy and money hungry she was. My great uncle owned a thriving liquor store but wanted to retire, and she offered to take over. He gave her all the inventory with the promise to pay him each month. She didn't do it. She kept odd hours and raised prices which stopped people from coming. She was making no money and couldn't pay for the inventory let alone the rent. The store closed. \n\nMy father died in 2013, we involved her in the planning, but since then I have only seen her once at a wedding. She did not acknowledge my mother's death in 2020, didn't show up, send a card or call.I personally didn't tell her, one of our relatives did and she was in the family chat and email chain that gave information. \n\nTuesday she called my sister and told her that my grandmother had about an acre of property that was willed to my father and her. We did not know about this land. She said she wanted to sell it because taxes have gone up and she couldn't afford it. The property wasn't in my father's will because  he didn't know about it, so my sister and I needed to sign heirship paperwork. We told her ok, but needed to have a lawyer look at it. Turned out my aunt has not paid taxes in over 20 years and owes $8,888.65. She signed the contract to sell the property for 25k in November, with it being finalized in December. The company found out she didn't own the land completely and stopped the sale. So,she never planned to tell us about the land or sale, and was going to keep the money to herself. I told our lawyer I wasn't signing anything. Her lawyer told us that then we were responsible for half of the back taxes. I said I wasn't paying either. That I would rather lose the land to auction for lack of payment than to let her have a dime.

When my great uncle died last year, they wanted to do a slide show from when he was younger and since my grandfather was the oldest (15 years older than him), he had all the photos from the late 1800s of my great great grandparents  ( he was born in 1916) etc, she refused  to let anyone scan them. The only photos anyone can get about them is from a series about African Americans in Texas from the institute of Texas cultures that she let borrow and scan that anyone can view in a local museum. Last year another museum had an exhibit on black cowboys that she let borrow and scan our family artifacts but she gatekeeps everything.", "That's what our lawyer said. He requested a copy of the will, I have never seen it, so waiting for a response.", "For a long time he was the only grandparent we had. Both my mother's parents and my father's mother died before I was 12 and he lived very close and would pick us up after school. After he got sick my sister and I both went away to college so we didn't see him often and I guess with the stroke, memory etc he felt neglected.", "I would have to split my dads share with my sister and even though I could really use the money, there are a lot of steps I need to do to prove heirship, including witnesses etc that would take a lot of my time that I'm too emotionally tired to do.", "The property is about an acre in a very small Texas town. Yearly the taxes are about 50.00. She chose not to pay what is essential the cost of her getting her nails done and it has  ballooned to nearly 9 grand because of late fees.

Then flip it to the interested buyer.  Cut the aunt out completely.", "Here in the UK when a property is sold, the monies go via the solicitor (lawyer) who pays out any disbursements, then pays out the rest. Ask your lawyer if you can enforce that the taxes *which she accrued* be taken out of her half? If she signs legal acknowledgement to pay the debt, you'd end up with 12.5k and she'd get just over 3k. Kind of revenge...", "Bingo", "I have to have 2 people who are not relatives and have known my father at least 10 years, sign affidavits that I am his daughter and get it signed by a notary.

You get 6,250. You pay 2,222.17 in back taxes... net you still get over 4,000 monies. Not a bad pay day for missing a day's work at a job that probably doesn't pay anywhere that much?

Hell even 2 day, even a full week to get it done...", "You two likely were willed more than just that property-*worth* a little time & effort!", "You\u2019re trifling. That is the most pathetic excuse.  Better hope nothing comes up that that money could take care of.", "Less than 4,000, you have to take out inheritance tax. I'm more angry that she has known about this for over 20 years, did not pay a $50 yearly tax this whole time causing the taxes to skyrocket and has the nerve to call, not to check how I'm doing, not to say Merry Christmas or Happy New Year... I live in my parents house which is a mile and a half away from her so she could essentially walk and put a notice in my mailbox but calls now after so many years because she wants money ... that's why I'm angry", "You're using trifling wrong, it means small or cheap and I'm neither. Plus you misunderstand my point. This all could have been taken care of 20 years ago, so I'm not going to waste my precious time doing paperwork just because she needs money. I never knew about it, so it's not a real loss.", "I get it. I'd be livid too. (& yes, I acknowledged the tax(es)) The problem is now that you know about it, you might be on the hook for it anyway. At least before you had that \"plausible denyability\".  Is there the possibility of charges for fraud or theft against her? Denying you benefit of use or some similar. You could have gone camping one long holiday weekend, every year as a new family tradition .  ?", "Exactly and coincidentally we just visited the town New Years eve. My cousins and I drive down for BBQ at a certain spot and then stop by this DELICIOUS Tex-Czech  bakery for sweets. They have a 5lb cinnamon roll that is to die for. I look forward to the drive, we go every few months or so for festivals etc."]}
