I\u2019m also plus size and in recovery for an eating disorder.  (this is relevant) I work out and eat healthy, I\u2019ve just always been bigger. I\u2019m about a size 18, but hourglass. I like how I look, lol.

Just normal college girl loungewear. Just like every other girl in the suite. \n\nSo heres the issue. Another girl in my suite, Sarah 18f, recently pulled me aside. She knocked on my door one night last week and asked to come in. She bluntly told me that I can\u2019t wear crop tops or shorts or tank tops, as she has an eating disorder, and my body is triggering for her and makes her want to starve. (Her words) I was kinda speechless, and asked her if she had asked anyone else to change their clothes. She said no, and she\u2019s sorry and thinks I\u2019m beautiful, but it\u2019s hard for her to look at, and I quote, my gross fat body. I politely told her I wasn\u2019t going to change my clothing, but I would be mindful of when she showers and stuff and wouldn\u2019t go in the bathroom area with her and stuff. I also told her I was in recovery for an eating disorder as well, and she told me that someone my size couldn\u2019t  have an eating disorder. She got all mad and huffy after that, and stormed out, and then proceeded to tell the RA I\u2019m not mindful of her triggers or disease. The RA told me I\u2019m fine and not in the wrong at all. When I told our other suitemates what happened, they got all mad at her and stopped inviting her to dinner and out. She DMed me today and told me I ruined everything. I\u2019m so lost; should I have just bent to her will? I didn\u2019t want her to get uninvited places, but my friends don\u2019t want to associate with someone who talks like that about me.
