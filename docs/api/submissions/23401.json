Back in May, she got a new, good paying job and we signed a lease together for an apartment that I just moved into about three weeks ago. \n\nWhen we originally signed the lease, we agreed that I would move in in July when the apartment came available and she would move in in November after having some time to live at home and save up some money. This will be her first time ever living out of her house, which she is very attached to as she\u2019s lived there her whole life and has a very close relationship with her mom. Her dad died in high school so her and her mom are VERY close. \n\nI had no problem with her waiting until November to move in. We agreed on that. Since then, she has been spending a lot more time at her house instead of time with me. She only stays at the apartment once or twice a week. She claims she is soaking up her final moments in the house she was raised in before she finally becomes an adult and moves out. Since we signed the lease, we have spent a lot less time together as she \u201csoaks up these last moments at home.\u201d I\u2019ve communicated that I wish we still spent more time together and I wish that she wanted to spend the night more often and start making this place feel like home. She always disagrees. \n\nObviously I\u2019m paying the rent alone for the next few months since i\u2019m the only one living here. The actual issue is that when shes here and we have people over, she refers to the apartment as \u201cour\u201d place. When I put something in a place she doesn\u2019t like (like putting a cleaner under the wrong sink) she claims this is her home too because her name is on the lease and she will be moving in soon, so she should get a say in where things go. I guess I don\u2019t see it as fair for her to call it our place, when I\u2019ve communicated nicely that I wish she wanted to spend more time over here and she always shoots it down. \n\nI told her this isn\u2019t her place yet because she doesn\u2019t pay for it yet, and she only spends one or two nights a week here. She doesn\u2019t want to spend more time here because she wants to soak up her final moments at home with her mom, so I told her if that\u2019s the case then she has no say in where I put things or how I do things here. I told her it\u2019s my home and not hers yet.  \n\nShe said this really hurt her feelings and makes her feel unwelcome here. Am I an asshole for telling her that?\n\nEdit for additional context: Her mom is very excited for her to move out and to become an empty nester. She travels a lot and has made it really clear she\u2019s ready for her kids to move out. So no pressure coming from moms end to stay home as much as possible. The new place is 15 minutes from her moms house and her job. We already eat with her mom regularly once per week and see her often other times. Also we\u2019re both women in this relationship.", "created_utc": 1690634733, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15crgio/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_this_apartment/", "score": 1552, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It seems like your GF is not ready to move out of her Mom\u2019s house.  You are hurt that you see her less now that you have an apt \u201ctogether\u201d. She is trying to take \u201c ownership\u201d of the apt in little ways - probably is helping her adjust to the idea of moving out.  \n\nYou do need to apologize. You were harsh. You need to discuss your actual feelings of neglect since she spends less time with you instead of lashing out over where the cleaning supplies go.  \n\nYou also need to be more empathetic towards her mixed feelings of moving out.  You say her Mom travels and wants an empty nest.  Your GF is probably feeling a little abandoned by Mom.  Maybe feeling pushed out of the family home even though she wants to live with you. Conflicting emotions that she is working through.  \n\nHonest communication would really help.  Good luck.", "It sounds like what you're really unhappy about is seeing your girlfriend less because I'm hearing you'd be fine with your girlfriend's behavior if she had moved in immediately. In response to that you've decided to take issue with a matter which will become trivial in just a few months time and has very little impact on you during those few months. \n\nI feel that YTA to yourself for sabotaging/harming a relationship you enjoy and want to continue to grow. Why not just let it go, spend the time you do currently have with your girlfriend doing something enjoyable together instead of fighting, and look forward to even more enjoyable time in just a few months? I encourage you to reflect on what you actually want as an outcome here and take an objective look at the best course of action to get you there (hint: picking unnecessary fights is not it).", "YTA\n\nYou can't tell her \"she\" wants to spend more time here - you want her to. Telling her what \"she wants\" is manipulative. She clearly wants a final few months at home with her mum, likely also so mum doesn't feel abandoned having already lost her husband. Did you not think that after losing her father so young she may want to take it slow on moving out from her remaining parent/have some difficult emotions about it?\n\nAnd also, yeah, if her name is on the lease and she's soon to move in, and you signed it together, calling it \"our\" place is fine and she does get a say in the organisation of things. She will be living there too and just because you agreed to the original plan of her moving in late doesn't mean you get to play dictator about the place in the meantime.\n\nHave some consideration for how this may be a difficult time for her moving out of her childhood home as well as an exciting one moving in with you. Right now you don't sound like the sort of partner one would want to move in with.", "You want her to spend more time there but you make her feel unwelcome by stating it isn\u2019t her place and that she gets no say in anything?

If I were her, I wouldn't want to move in with someone who talks to me like that. \n\nWord of advice: don't let roommate issues become relationship issues. She's not just a roommate, she's your girlfriend. The way you talk to her should reflect that.

Right now you\u2019re feeling resentment that she\u2019s spending less time with you and that is beginning to crop up in your interactions.

Don\u2019t shoot yourself in the foot by making her feel unwelcomed into what will be her home. \n\nPlease sit down and talk this out openly and maturely without any of this passive-aggressive push/pull stuff. Maybe assure her that she will always stay connected to her mom. It doesn\u2019t sound like the apartment is far from her mom\u2019s; maybe commit to weekly dinner with her mom (one week at yours, the next at her mom\u2019s might be a nice bridge to make both places a home to all of you). Maybe you need to work out a timeline that includes her transitioning to spend more time at your apartment (by x time she\u2019ll spend half the week with you, then by x, it\u2019ll be 5 days, etc.). \n\nStrictly speaking, what you said was a sh*tty thing to say. You asked if you\u2019re an AH for saying that, and yes, you are.

Her name is on the lease so it technically is her place as well, even if she\u2019s not paying rent", "Yes YTA! Dude have some compassion for her. Moving out for the first time is scary. I am sure she has a bit of guilt for leaving her mom. She\u2019s getting used to it a little at a time. It sounds like the issue is you are resentful about her spending so much time with mom.

You might want to suggest that you hang out at her mom's together (obviously don't ask to stay over) and ask her if she needs help packing/moving her things. The offer might help it sink in for her that she's also on the lease and needs to start occupying the residence.

It's not easy for everyone esp when it's not coming with a lot of excitement the way it does for many people (moving to a new place, college or job, etc).

An adult who loves their Mom, feels guilt over leaving her on her own...is childish because she wants to spend a bunch of time with her mother before making that break??? Bullshit. It is human. It is people actually caring about other people. She signed that lease, she made that commitment and now she is saying goodbye to her mother and her childhood. She, and she alone, gets to dictate what that goodbye looks like. It wasn't that !ong ago that engaged couples lived with their families up until the day they got married.BTW, she is NOT spending all her time at her mothers home, she got a new good paying job which enabled THEM to get an apartment together...so she is also working.\nEDITED to add that it has only been THREE EFFING WEEKS!

Going your route will sabotage your plans and goals at this point.\n\nUnderstand why she seems to have a harder time letting go and moving in. Seems like she's having doubts and apprehensions about the whole thing. Be accommodating. Talk things with her. Plan things with her. If things go right, you'll be on even ground eventually anyway.

I\u2019m not sure what would make you feel heard, but perhaps there could be something that doesn\u2019t require her to come over more in this period?

It\u2019s totally valid to feel hurt but I think it might be worth parsing it a bit.\n\nIf the issue is the reduced time you\u2019re spending together, then focus on that. That\u2019s got nothing to do with the house. If she\u2019s working a full-time job for the first time, she has much less time in general\u2014not for you specifically. It\u2019s more than just working hours (getting ready, commuting, etc.) She also probably has less energy. That\u2019s not personal and it\u2019s not something she\u2019s doing to you.\n\nWhat did you do together before you signed the lease? How can you spend time together without spending the night? Can you find ways to spend extra time with her that don\u2019t involve her coming to the house? Can you visit her at her mum\u2019s place, or meet her near her work when she finishes? Are there ways you can spend time together without actually being together(phone calls, streaming shows at the same time, online games, etc).\n\nI do hear that she has brushed you off when you\u2019ve tried to raise it. It\u2019s okay to bring it up again and try to solve the problem together. But do so kindly and collaboratively\u2014try not to blame or criticise her. Tell her you miss her and that it hurts that you haven\u2019t spent much time together in the last few months, and that it\u2019s important to you to find ways to keep connected that work for both of you.\n\nBut don\u2019t get upset with her for not being upset, or for not proactively solving the problem, or assume it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t want to spend time with you. That\u2019s not fair. You can\u2019t read her mind. She has a lot going on and sometimes we all have seasons of life where things like new jobs take up emotional and energetic space we wish we could spend on other things. We all go into autopilot sometimes. That\u2019s not something she\u2019s doing to you to hurt you. Don\u2019t assign malice or assume her thinking.\n\nWith the move, what is your relationship like with her mum? If it\u2019s a good relationship, maybe you could start a tradition like all three of you having a weekly dinner together that can continue once she moves in with you. That might help reassure her that she will still have lots of contact with her mum and prepare her for the transition when she does move out.\n\nAnd if she has ideas of how to decorate, are there fun things you can do together (or apart) to make the home feel like yours? You could each work on small crochet or crafty projects for the home like rugs or blankets or wall hangings (there are great beginner YouTube tutorials for this!) or build a shared Pinterest board of ideas. Maybe she can come over and you can spend one of your date nights painting a room or getting ideas. What are ways you can work together to make the home feel more shared and less like a lonely space for you?\n\nGood luck!", "I\u2019m not sure if this will change anyone\u2019s thoughts (i didn\u2019t even think this was relevant), but we are both women.

I was mentally out of my place with my mom long before I physically left. My now husband was finishing college while living in his childhood home. We lived there together for about a year before we moved. When we moved we were lucky to be renting a house from a coworker of hubs. So we took our time moving all our old and new stuff into the house while staying with his parents. We had dinner with them most nights for the time we were moving. We both enjoyed making some last memories living there and when we left for the last time we both cried a little with his parents because we all knew it was going to be so different and a little quiet until we all settled. It was a bit surreal to me cause my background but it was also a very sweet experience. \n\nAt no point did we feel like the rental was any less out home than the parents house. I also don\u2019t think the real issue here is OP not feeling like it\u2019s GFs home too. It\u2019s more of OP wanting more time with GF and it seems a bit of not understanding how GF feels about leaving home. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a made up excuse like OP almost seems to hint at, I believe she really is just enjoying her last moments in her childhood home and OP needs to accept that or this is going to turn into the first big crack in their relationship foundation.", "\"she can make us nachos and cookies.\"", "so you're jealous that you aren't getting enough attention while she takes the time she needs to process a major change in her life and you dealt with that by having a little pout and being snarky", "In this case, NTA and it's simply because although the GF is on the lease, she's actually not living there and not spending much time there either.

It may depend on how the conversation actually went because it sounds like an over reaction.\n\nWhen having friends over, saying 'our' apartment is neither here nor there.  But dictating where stuff you use regularly is kept when she doesn't use it... is pushing the boundaries.\n\nYou weren't wrong in what you said but you may need to take a close look at what is happening and whether there is a deeper issue in your relationship.  It may just be that she's grieving moving out (even though her mom is happy with her going), she may just be anxious knowing she now needs to be the adult in her own home and not have her mother organise the house stuff, she may just be controlling and have her own thoughts on what needs to happen and needs to learn to compromise.

Still YTA her making decisions on where things go is a baby step in \"making it home\" for her which is what you said you wanted and then you respond by telling her it isn't her house?

I\u2019m going with a soft YTA here, but it\u2019s a tough situation and I do see both sides. As has been stated already, her name is on the lease so legally it is her space as much as it is yours. Secondly, and the reason for my soft YTA rating, you making comments that it is not her space and she doesn\u2019t have a say etc. probably does not make her comfortable or want to be there. The plan is ultimately for her to move in so it is her space, and referring to it as your shared space is potentially a way she\u2019s preparing for the move. Moving out of her childhood home and into one with you is a big deal so she\u2019s probably having a lot of emotions about it and hopefully is doing the work to be mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and physically ready for the transition. \n\nWith that said, OP, I also completely understand your frustrations and they are 100% valid. I think anybody in your situation would be frustrated. I would suggest referring to the apartment as your shared space and continuing to show excitement about the plan. Include her in discussions such as what color theme she envisions for the rooms, etc. Also maybe going together to a home store and looking at things and getting ideas for how you both want to decorate; shoot, even let her buy something and put it where she thinks it should go. Or maybe have a date exploring the local area to get a feel for how it\u2019ll be. I feel like things like that would probably help the transition and make it more exciting for both of you. \n\nI think you both can work through this, it\u2019s just going to take a lot of patience, grace and open/honest/kind conversations. I truly hope the best for you both.", "OP's girlfriend's name is the only thing that ties her to the apartment, apparently.

She likely knows exactly what she means but is forgetting you can't read her mind to know her exact intentions. \n\nThis is basic relationship building stronger communication, openness, safety and trust.\n\nYou're going to get through this and be stronger from it. These talks are inevitable and I believe having them early builds a stronger relationship sooner.\n\nWe all have different strengths and weaknesses. We can't read minds and others don't know exactly our meaning when we say things too simply.\n\nSo having a calm and private talk where you give space for eachother to better explain your meaning and feelings is all that you can do.\n\nYou both need to feel heard but first you must be understood. I find so much hurt and frustration often comes from misunderstanding innocent behavior and not voicing that or checking in for a different explanation of what they meant.\n\nEven if things stay this way until November what would make you both feel good is hearing the other knows your intentions, your concerns and feelings. Just feeling heard, supported and reassured makes a huge difference. \n\nI honestly believe you two can look back at this in 6 months and feel grateful it happened because you'll be better connected, better communicators.\n\nThis stuff always comes up, it has to, it's how you handle it that decides if you grow stronger or more distant.\n\nWe all have different styles of communication and love languages, the better you learn the others, the more peaceful you will feel as you understand them deeper.\n\nOnce you talk it out, I would personally start decorating the place together.\nHave some drinks and dinners where you have fun and also discuss ideas on where to place things. Discuss why one place may be better and work as a team creating your new life together, blending your choices.\n\nThis is a home being made to be your shared home, that's a great bonding period of making choices that I wouldn't want to miss.\n\nThe more you have fun and create your home together, the more stable you will both feel.\n\nThese are beautiful and exciting times in relationships. Make it fun and memorable.\n\nJust remember you both come from homes that did things differently, now you are coming together to join your ideas not just copy what your parents did. This should be a collaborative process of cooperation.\nTogether you will create even better ways of doing things.\n\nCongrats on your new place and this new time in your relationship!\n\nNAH", "I'm sorry. My mom is still around and would love to make you cookies", "Aw, thanks, that's sweet! Just enjoy yr mom and her cookies for me and both of you have long and happy lives."]}
