Back in May, she got a new, good paying job and we signed a lease together for an apartment that I just moved into about three weeks ago. \n\nWhen we originally signed the lease, we agreed that I would move in in July when the apartment came available and she would move in in November after having some time to live at home and save up some money. This will be her first time ever living out of her house, which she is very attached to as she\u2019s lived there her whole life and has a very close relationship with her mom. Her dad died in high school so her and her mom are VERY close. \n\nI had no problem with her waiting until November to move in. We agreed on that. Since then, she has been spending a lot more time at her house instead of time with me. She only stays at the apartment once or twice a week. She claims she is soaking up her final moments in the house she was raised in before she finally becomes an adult and moves out. Since we signed the lease, we have spent a lot less time together as she \u201csoaks up these last moments at home.\u201d I\u2019ve communicated that I wish we still spent more time together and I wish that she wanted to spend the night more often and start making this place feel like home. She always disagrees. \n\nObviously I\u2019m paying the rent alone for the next few months since i\u2019m the only one living here. The actual issue is that when shes here and we have people over, she refers to the apartment as \u201cour\u201d place. When I put something in a place she doesn\u2019t like (like putting a cleaner under the wrong sink) she claims this is her home too because her name is on the lease and she will be moving in soon, so she should get a say in where things go. I guess I don\u2019t see it as fair for her to call it our place, when I\u2019ve communicated nicely that I wish she wanted to spend more time over here and she always shoots it down. \n\nI told her this isn\u2019t her place yet because she doesn\u2019t pay for it yet, and she only spends one or two nights a week here. She doesn\u2019t want to spend more time here because she wants to soak up her final moments at home with her mom, so I told her if that\u2019s the case then she has no say in where I put things or how I do things here. I told her it\u2019s my home and not hers yet.  \n\nShe said this really hurt her feelings and makes her feel unwelcome here. Am I an asshole for telling her that?\n\nEdit for additional context: Her mom is very excited for her to move out and to become an empty nester. She travels a lot and has made it really clear she\u2019s ready for her kids to move out. So no pressure coming from moms end to stay home as much as possible.", "created_utc": 1690634733, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15crgio/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_this_apartment/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It seems like your GF is not ready to move out of her Mom\u2019s house.  You are hurt that you see her less now that you have an apt \u201ctogether\u201d. She is trying to take \u201c ownership\u201d of the apt in little ways - probably is helping her adjust to the idea of moving out.  \n\nYou do need to apologize. You were harsh. You need to discuss your actual feelings of neglect since she spends less time with you instead of lashing out over where the cleaning supplies go.  \n\nYou also need to be more empathetic towards her mixed feelings of moving out.  You say her Mom travels and wants an empty nest.  Your GF is probably feeling a little abandoned by Mom.  Maybe feeling pushed out of the family home even though she wants to live with you. Conflicting emotions that she is working through.  \n\nHonest communication would really help.  Good luck.", "It sounds like what you're really unhappy about is seeing your girlfriend less because I'm hearing you'd be fine with your girlfriend's behavior if she had moved in immediately. In response to that you've decided to take issue with a matter which will become trivial in just a few months time and has very little impact on you during those few months. \n\nI feel that YTA to yourself for sabotaging/harming a relationship you enjoy and want to continue to grow. Why not just let it go, spend the time you do currently have with your girlfriend doing something enjoyable together instead of fighting, and look forward to even more enjoyable time in just a few months? I encourage you to reflect on what you actually want as an outcome here and take an objective look at the best course of action to get you there (hint: picking unnecessary fights is not it).", "YTA\n\nYou can't tell her \"she\" wants to spend more time here - you want her to. Telling her what \"she wants\" is manipulative. She clearly wants a final few months at home with her mum, likely also so mum doesn't feel abandoned having already lost her husband. Did you not think that after losing her father so young she may want to take it slow on moving out from her remaining parent/have some difficult emotions about it?\n\nAnd also, yeah, if her name is on the lease and she's soon to move in, and you signed it together, calling it \"our\" place is fine and she does get a say in the organisation of things. She will be living there too and just because you agreed to the original plan of her moving in late doesn't mean you get to play dictator about the place in the meantime.\n\nHave some consideration for how this may be a difficult time for her moving out of her childhood home as well as an exciting one moving in with you. Right now you don't sound like the sort of partner one would want to move in with.", "You want her to spend more time there but you make her feel unwelcome by stating it isn\u2019t her place and that she gets no say in anything? I think that\u2019s gonna have the opposite effect buddy.", "YTA. It sounds rude and condescending. If I were her, I wouldn't want to move in with someone who talks to me like that. \n\nWord of advice: don't let roommate issues become relationship issues. She's not just a roommate, she's your girlfriend. The way you talk to her should reflect that.

Her name is on the lease so technically and legally, it IS her apartment, too. However, I understand where you're coming from.

What she has is an *option* to co-habit with you but imho her mom will have to use dynamite to get her out of the family home.  That \u2018soak up every possible moment with mom before becoming an adult\u2019 leads me to think your girlfriend is going to have one heck of a learning curve and will run home to mom for years to come.

Legally, the place is both of yours though, since you\u2019re the only one paying rent right now, I get how you feel more entitled to saying it\u2019s my place. \n\nBut, the plan is that she is moving in. Right now you\u2019re feeling resentment that she\u2019s spending less time with you and that is beginning to crop up in your interactions. Dismissing her input, though, only adds to her trepidation to leave her comfort zone. Don\u2019t shoot yourself in the foot by making her feel unwelcomed into what will be her home. \n\nPlease sit down and talk this out openly and maturely without any of this passive-aggressive push/pull stuff. Maybe assure her that she will always stay connected to her mom. It doesn\u2019t sound like the apartment is far from her mom\u2019s; maybe commit to weekly dinner with her mom (one week at yours, the next at her mom\u2019s might be a nice bridge to make both places a home to all of you). Maybe you need to work out a timeline that includes her transitioning to spend more time at your apartment (by x time she\u2019ll spend half the week with you, then by x, it\u2019ll be 5 days, etc.). \n\nStrictly speaking, what you said was a sh*tty thing to say. You asked if you\u2019re an AH for saying that, and yes, you are. But it\u2019s not a permanent label, so sit down and talk it out.", "NTA- I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here with all of these Y T A votes, but she is a fully grown legal adult who signed a lease, but has not paid a penny on it, spends much less time with op than before, and refuses to leave mom's house, despite mom being ready for her to go. Seems like she doesn't want to move out, but whatever the case, she gets a say in the apartment when she starts paying half the rent.", "Hmm I\u2019d say YTA. Her name is on the lease so it technically is her place as well, even if she\u2019s not paying rent", "Yes YTA! Dude have some compassion for her. Moving out for the first time is scary. I am sure she has a bit of guilt for leaving her mom. She\u2019s getting used to it a little at a time. It sounds like the issue is you are resentful about her spending so much time with mom. Try to,think about how hard this is on her and her mom given the history. Be thankful for her being involved in any way at the place. It is her baby steps. True love would see all this and be supportive and encouraging.", "NTA", "\"She said this really hurt her feelings and makes her feel unwelcome here.\"\n\nGood.

It might be a hard transition but you\u2019re in a position to help her along and make this a fun experience, and you\u2019re doing the opposite of that right now.", "YTA.  You agreed she would move in in November.  My guess is that you secretly expected her to forget all about that and jump right into playing house with you, and now you're all butthurt because she is sticking to the plan and not meeting your secret expectations.

I get it, she really should move in faster and it's irritating to everyone involved, but do you really think saying this stuff will foster any kind of intimacy? It's hard moving out for the first time, even at her age, and I think she wants to feel safe. You might want to suggest that you hang out at her mom's together (obviously don't ask to stay over) and ask her if she needs help packing/moving her things. The offer might help it sink in for her that she's also on the lease and needs to start occupying the residence. I agree with the root of your frustration and I think you have a right to feel upset, though alienating her during an already alienating time is going to make her just as resentful as you are right now.

I mean, since you want to be so technical about it and split hairs. \n\nYTA. Grow up. Things happen in life that takes our attention for a bit. Give her time.

You want her to spend more time with you, so you berate her and be incredibly rude towards her? I'd be rethinking moving in at all. Nobody who actually respected her would treat her that way.", "ESH. At 23 your gf is an adult and legally has been for the last 5 years. Her excuse to not move in is so bogus. And you basically live alone and pay for everything while she plays \"little girl\" living with her mom.

I get the frustration, and I'm sure it was hard to find a better way to tell her.", "NAH\n\nYou are frustrated and that's fair. It's rude for her to act as though she is a part of the apt that you got for both of you when she isn't. \n\nBut. It sounds like she's having trouble with the concept of transitioning into a full adult and leaving her childhood behind. It's not easy for everyone esp when it's not coming with a lot of excitement the way it does for many people (moving to a new place, college or job, etc). For her it's just an end to childhood - and yes life with you but it's still a huge chapter closing.", "Unpopular opinion: NTA\n\nYou genuinely can't do the, \"my boyfriend is so clueless, always forgetting where we keep things ... I love hosting in our home\" act, repeating how you've seen adult women on TV and real life talk, while you're not contributing to rent and you've chosen to continue living with your Mum for the next 4 months for no valid reason.

It definitely is the case that I just feel hurt by suddenly losing a lot of time together as soon as the lease was signed, and even though I have communicated that to her in several times in a mature way, she kinda brushes it off. I was wrong though to be harsh and so see that now. Apology coming soon, lol.", "This hits just right. I feel this!\n\nCan you do other little things like ask her to pick up some dish towels or a rug or silly things like that? Help her feel more excited and less dread.

It doesn\u2019t mean that we get a pass for saying something hurtful. It means we should apologize and talk it out. And, I want to be clear that this is not all on you. She needs to hear your side and understand that you feel you\u2019re starting a life together and her reluctance to spend more time with you is wearing you down and hurting you, also. \n\nWe all make mistakes; it\u2019s how we handle it that makes the difference.
