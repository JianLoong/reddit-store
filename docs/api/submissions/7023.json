I check the menu beforehand and see that most of their dishes have peanuts or some sort of peanut ingredients in it (its a Thai restaurant). I told him I wouldn't be able to even go in there let alone eat anything there and he got upset. He went off on me about how I'm a picky eater and how he always has to cater to my eating preferences and how I always get to pick where we eat when we hang out. I reminded him of my peanut allergy but he said he thought it was funny at first and played along but now doesn't believe me. When I suggested we go eat somewhere else he lost it and took my hand and tried to drag me out the door and said he was going to prove I'm not allergic and take me to that restaurant. I resisted and he said fine he was gonna go eat without me, and called me an asshole for refusing to let him pick a restaurant this one time. I texted him later apologizing that we can't go to certain places to eat because of my allergy and he responded that he was going to cure my allergy by exposing me to peanuts. I don't think he is serious, I think he's just a little upset about earlier. AITA for not wanting to go to the restaurant he chose?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for your responses! I appreciate everyone assuring words! My boyfriend was definitely out of line for the way he reacted.
