I\u2019ve just started this with my own kid (4), at least as pertains to making decisions with his own money (allowance).

There is nothing wrong with that.", "NTA.  My son is 4, and sometimes when he gets to pick out a toy I steer him away from one I don't think he'll actually like and say \"are you sure you don't want this toy instead?\" So I can see where your wife is coming from, and it would be fine to say \"are you sure you don't want the stuffed animal instead?\" But in the end it's her choice.\n\nYou need to talk with your wife about the last comment in your post though.

The amount of crap coming into the house has gone from one piece to a billion why isn\u2019t it possible that\u2019s what she\u2019s mad about?", ">why isn\u2019t it possible that\u2019s what she\u2019s mad about?\n\nBecause that's literally not what she claimed her problem with it is. \n\nWhy do you think you get to dictate what othet peoples problems with a gift are? \n\nGod foebid anyone trust what someone says on their own athoughts and feelings, how could they know more about themselves than you?", "He says her problem is that the daughter usually like stuffed animals. There\u2019s no dictating lol", ">He says her problem is that the daughter usually like stuffed animals.\n\nYeah, and then the kid picked something else out \n\n>There\u2019s no dictating lol\n\n\"Why can't it be because she doesn't want to pick it up and then \n\n>He says her problem is that the daughter usually like stuffed animals.\n\nThat is literally you dictating and changing what she said her reasons were to instead be what YOU want p5vef what they claim \n\nAka dictating someones thoughts and opinions over their own stated knes", "If the kid ends up regretting it the mom will have to deal with that AND the billion pieces", "NTA. siblings do that all the time - hey yours looks better, i'll copy you. something else is going on with your wife\n\nEDIT saw your other comment about your wife thinking she'd like a stuffed toy better. the kid wanted something else lmao, and if she changes her mind it's a lesson i guess", "Wtf. This was not the direction I thought it was going to go.  Yta.  Your wife though.....good luck.", "NTA but based on your comments it seems like there is a good chance your daughter is going to later regret her choice that could lead to a tantrum/meltdown which is why your wife was encouraging her to go with her original choice.\n\nHope you are planning on being the one to handle that.", "I think changing minds is totally allowed. Back in the stone age, My mother used to let us loose in the toy department and say, you can have any one thing that only has two (or three) numbers in the price. Because spending a buck was an affordable splurge, you know.\n\nI think a one toy rule at a museum that generally carry lovely and educational toys is a great opportunity, even if later there are regrets - it's part of life & growing up, not all decisions are equal :)", "NTA I'm an adult and love those dino puzzles. I think your wife is trying to make your daughter into a \"proper\" girl and not a \"tomboy\". As a kid I spent hours outside under the air-conditioner where the water drips playing with my dinosaurs and making an entire landscape for them. I always wanted to be a paleontologist.", "You forgot the /s tag.  I'll give you an upvote.", "We are planning cave trips next year. They will be turning 16. They love caves and horses. There is an underground river you can take a boat on a few hours from us and many other systems close so that's what we are trying for. This Christmas we are taking them on a historical train ride and doing some horseback riding ... I have had 5 spinal and 2 neck surgeries so it's been a while since we have been able to fully plan an outdoor excursion lol. We have taken them to the Biltmore in NC also it was amazing. Of course we leave the mansion and they have like 15 pics and then 30 from the bowling alley in the basement of the house lol.", "Yeah NTA. This is a great very low risk way to teach kids decision making. If she chooses something she likes, she has a thing she likes. If she regrets her choice, she learns something about dealing with regret, living with consequences, and making thoughtful decisions. And still has a neat toy. Choosing between two pretty neat toys is an ideal training ground.\n\nWe started giving our kids an allowance as early as we did largely to teach decision making and buyers remorse in an extremely low risk way. This is exactly the way to teach these concepts.", "Irrelevant.  Lol.   Kid had option and chose what they wanted", "That sounds like a wonderful trip. An underground river trip sounds awesome. Went on a few cave excursions with my boys when they were young.  It was great fun.", "Your parents are great and now I\u2019m going to see if I can find a vintage Zorro sword.", "NTA lmao wut", "You are just weird", "Info: maybe your wife thought the kids could share the two different souvenirs rather than getting two of the same things to bring home?", "Right?  Jealous of her husbands relationship with their child.", "\"mold the kids\"  \nwhat?", "Then she regrets it and puts more thought into her next buying decision. It's good for kids to learn about buyer's remorse in relatively low stakes situations. NTA", "Omg SAME. Woah. It's mostly with food; I was a picky kid growing up but I've loved spicy things for years now and I still hear ,\"yOu dOnT LiKe sPiCy sTuFf.\"", "Then why didn\u2019t she push for OP to buy the stuffed animal for the son as well?", "I assumed she\u2019s more into dolls and husband was more into scientific things.   Hence mom\u2019s comment about making the daughter like him instead of herself.  Like the mom would want the stuffy so he talked daughter out of a stuffy to a toy he would like to play with.  \n\nNot necessarily boy/girl but more his interests vs wife.", "Could be as She's 7 and growing totally out of the baby phase, OP's wife is having trouble realizing she's not a baby anymore. She could just be copying her brother or she could have realized the puzzle would provide hours of fun which is actually a pretty smart value decision for a 7 yr old. Also might work out to be a nice bonding experience for the kids.", "It was made out of plastic, of course, but it had a fancy hilt. Very cool.", "how much you wanna bet it\u2019s because the stuffed animal is more \u201cgirly\u201d and the puzzle isn\u2019t girly enough", "NTA. The fact that your wife is making your kids out to be mini versions of you both is worrying they aren\u2019t they are their own individual people and they can make up their own minds. I\u2019d be having a talk about that", "Just because you like one thing doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t enjoy another. I absolutely loved those Dino bones puzzles as a kid! So for one she should respect your daughters autonomy and second she\u2019s just wrong\u2014 the Dino bones are cooler", "I would have been excited if my daughter chose a mentally challenging puzzle over a toy!", "NTA and it sounds like you have MUCH bigger puzzle to FIX FIRST.", "I don't even think that's it.  It seems more like \"my brother is getting a cooler toy and I want one too!\"  Chances are, she's already got plenty of stuffed animals.  In any event, it's her choice.", "I feel that the making her \u2018like\u2019 him comment was more about preferring him over her, not aligning her interests with his. OP wouldn\u2019t have needed to get her to get something he was interested in since the son was already getting that toy", "Wtf. Your wife has problems. NTA", "NTA. Your daughter is not either of you. She is her own person with her own interests. Your wife seems to have some unresolved issues to get worked up over a toy. I would try to get some time alone with her to talk about what is bothering her.", "They said she can have what she wanted. Her brother choose what he wanted the only fair thing is for her to choose to. Op didn\u2019t have to back up the wife strange ideas against the daughter free will.", "She didn\u2019t saying anything about them arguing. Also when they choose the same toys there are usually less conflict. Immagine buy the stuffed animal when the daughter wanted to play with the brother puzzle.\n\nMold kids is so much a nonsense. I live puzzle, I had plenty of toys like that one, and for sure I\u2019m not in STEM.", "Does she like stuffed toys and nothing else? Does she \"like\" stuffed toys because people decided she did and bought her a collection? Does she absolutely genuine love stuffed toys, but also wants new experiences?\n\nWe are allowed to like more than one thing!", "I\u2019m picturing the most potentially weird things a four year old might choose to get with his allowance, and I truly hope his choices are even sillier and more inexplicable than whatever I can come up with \u263a\ufe0f"]}
