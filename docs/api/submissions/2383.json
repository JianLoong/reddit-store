Also could be something brother and her enjoy as a hobby for years to come.. maybe dino maybe just puzzles or my dad built models and I painted them for him. She was building Lego sets at 4 . And we look for science museums when we go do stuff in other places. Me, hubby DD and her best friend take a trip every year for their b day and Christmas (1 trip total) and even her friend loves it.

Cool! \nNothing wrong with gifting her what she wanted.", "NTA , girls like things other than \"gitly\" stuff.  My daughter loves dinosaurs", "NTA since she wanted the puzzle. Weird come back from your wife on that.", "NTA, but you both need to start working as a team. If your wife told your daughter to pick out a stuffed animal first, then you should have backed her up so the kids see you're a team. If you said she could have the puzzle first, your wife should have backed you up.", "NTA.", "NTA children are individuals, they are not little clones of their parents.\nI think it's time your wife learned this.", "NTA - What?", "Nta.", "NTA. \n\n>My wife got mad and said I used the opportunity to make my daughter like me instead of her\n\nWhat does this mean? As written your daughter chose the stuffed animal on her own and changed her mind on her own. At first I thought your wife was pushing back because she thought the puzzle was too advanced or something.", "NTA. But this is definitely deeper than a stuffed toy.  Best to sit down with your wife and ask her what\u2019s going on.", "NTA. They will get more enjoyment from the puzzle. \n\nYeah. Post in r/dinosaurs when they make them.", "NTA - You got her what she wanted. Your wife is ridiculous.", "NTA. I mean... there is a slight chance your daughter will regret the puzzle and your wife might be able to foresee that coming but still NTA. I was prepared to see your wife trying to push gender stereotypes on your daughter saying something like \"oh girls shouldn't get puzzles\" but I was surprised.", "NTA and your wife needs to loosen the reigns a bit. If the daughter throws a fit because later she realized she actually wanted the stuffed animal, then oh well! I could see if your wife is the one to handle most or all of the kids having tantrums or negative feelings, she would want to avoid it. So maybe that\u2019s why? But if not then idk man she needs to chill.", "NTA.  You got your child what she wanted.  If your wife wanted a stuffie, she should have bought it herself.", "NTA. Does this have anything to do with daughter choosing toy that isn\u2019t tied to gender binary norms?

She shouldn't be forced to get what mom wanted for her.", "NTA", "INFO\n\nWhat was your response to each child? Did you make a big fuss over your son\u2019s choice?

I also see your wife's foresight into  arguments about whose puzzle pieces are whose and wanting to avoid being the referee.\n\nOn the other hand, I also see both of you trying to mold the kids, You're making little STEM majors, while wife wants a girly daughter.\n\nI differences between you and your wife, but no asshole behavior.", "This is actually an important lesson for your daughter here.   Your wife has fumbled this, but can recover.\n\nSomeday, 10, 12, 15 years from now, your daughter may want to change her mind about something.   It's important that she knows that that's OK.   Whether it's a boy, education, or a career, she needs to know you both will back her up.", "My wife thought my daughter would regret buying the puzzle instead because my daughter likes stuffed animals. Should have added that to the post whoops", "That was my thought, that maybe it\u2019s based on gender norms. Stuffed animal feels like the more typical \u201cgirl\u201d option.\n\nA puzzle like that sounds cool and will actually have her really using her mind to put it together, can be a good mental exercise for her! Nothing wrong with her having the puzzle she wants", "She thinks my daughter would regret not buying the stuffed animal", "So OP should have arbitrarily refused to get their daughter what she wanted, when they told her she can get an item that she wants, because mom decided on what their daughter should get? There was no issue until mom made it an issue, and it inserted some completely unnecessary conflict into a family outing. Following through on your word to your kids is more important than backing up a completely unnecessary and controlling whim from your partner.", "Apparently wife thinks that the daughter will regret not getting the stuffed animal?\n\nIt's just like... So what? You still don't get to override her decision for something as small as a toy from a gift shop. If she regrets the decision, oh well, she knows for next time that she'd prefer stuffed animals.", "All good, still doesn't really justify her actions. Kids need to learn how to make decisions, and how to process if they regret a decision. Getting a puzzle instead of a stuffed animal is not a big deal, even if daughter ended up wishing she hadn't changed her mind.", "It *might* be based on the kid showing a pattern of ignoring her own wishes to be just like an older sibling - kids do do that sometimes, and ~~3 is a prime age for it because they haven't really formed firm preferences yet~~ younger is 7 I can't read, but it's still plausible - but the accusation of \"you're trying to be the cool parent\" isn't inclining me to give the benefit of the doubt.\n\nAlso, those Dino skeleton puzzles are great, I still have my old T-rex \ud83d\ude01", "Maybe she's right, maybe she's not. Either way she has to let your daughter make her own choices and deal with the consequences. You made the right decision, NTA.", "So worst case, it ends up as an arguably necessary learning experience for your daughter?", "Whether or not she's right, your daughter is of an age to make those choices and deal with what comes; making choices for her won't help her grow.\n\nAlso your wife is odd if she's taking this as a personal assault. Your kids are going to be who they are, a little bit of each of their parents and a whole lot of themselves. Your wife needs to recognize that now and make her peace with it. She's not raising a clone or a Mini-Me.\n\nNTA", "I mean, she might regret not buying the stuffed animal. But she also might not. Either way, learning how to appropriately handle and process regret is an essential skill for children to learn. I suspect that your wife is likely just trying to protect your daughter from having to feel negative emotions but she's not actually doing your kids any favors by doing that.", "> Kids need to learn how to make decisions, and how to process if they regret a decision.\n\nAbsolutely. I\u2019ve just started this with my own kid (4), at least as pertains to making decisions with his own money (allowance). It\u2019s an important part of teaching them personal/fiscal responsibility.", "Agree. Especially the part of learning that sometimes we can regret a choice, but making a choice out of fear of possible later regret is worse.", "NTA  Kids were given the choice.  Why was she stuck on a stuffed animal?", "Daughter might have plenty of stuffed animals, and wanted something a little different!", "NTA\nYour daughter wanted a puzzle. There is nothing wrong with that.", "NTA.  My son is 4, and sometimes when he gets to pick out a toy I steer him away from one I don't think he'll actually like and say \"are you sure you don't want this toy instead?\" So I can see where your wife is coming from, and it would be fine to say \"are you sure you don't want the stuffed animal instead?\" But in the end it's her choice.\n\nYou need to talk with your wife about the last comment in your post though.  That's not healthy.", "NTA But your wife is being weird about it. You bought your kid what she wanted. End of story", "NTA. This is about what your daughter wanted. Your wife\u2019s reaction is unwarranted.", "NTA but that's not really normal. Right now it's harmless but make sure you keep an eye on how she treats the kids. The worst is she probably will try to force them to be the way she wants. Again this is worse case scenarios", "NTA I'm a woman and thought those were really cool when I was young. If your wife is insecure that her daughter won't be like her, imo she isn't a good parent - but obviously I only know this about her.", "NTA because stuffed animals are a cute adorable plague that you can't get rid of! What is your wife thinking.", "My parents were always controlling this, like \"but you don't like X!\" or \"wow, that's not like you.\" Had real identity issues before I could move away, and still kind of struggle with how to act around them.\n\nIt's weird because I though it was just a me problem, but around friends and my BF, I don't have this issue now.", "Yeah I think there could be a lot of reasons for her switching to the puzzle, and plenty of reasons wife could be upset. Could worry cuz she usually prefers stuffed animals, could think she\u2019s just copying her brother, or it could be a gender roles thing.\n\nIf it is gender roles, that\u2019s shitty. If it\u2019s something else\u2026she\u2019s 7, it\u2019s a good time for learning about choices and regret with really small low-risk things like this. Next time you think she may regret her choice, you can bring out the \u201care you sure?\u201d And help her work on her decision making.\n\nAlso yeah, when I was a kid I looooved those puzzles.

It's not about how much more love/like she has for each of you, but about the experience of putting together a dinosaur, which sounds fun...\n\nIt's sad that she see's this as a competition.

I guess you could always buy your wife a stuffed dinosaur\n\nNTA", "NTA You tell a kid to choose a toy, you buy the toy they choose. It's a pretty simple concept.

Your wife is one of those who thinks girls have to do girly stuff? Please sit down and talk to her calmy about this before it goes too far.
