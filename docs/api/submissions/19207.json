My wife is pregnant with our third kid now. She's 20 weeks pregnant. \n\nSo my daughters have never been picky about their food since I used to cook all meals and never introduced them to junk food. However, about 2 months back I was assigned to a new project at work and started working long hours(70/week) so I have been unable to cook as often now. I wanted to hire a cook because my wife was having severe pregnancy symptoms but my wife said she wanted to try cooking for our kids and she also didn't like the idea of a stranger at our house. I agreed to her idea since she suggested it herself. \n\nFor the first month or so, she cooked pretty diligently for the kids and both of us as well. however, after that, she reduced the quality of the meals. What I mean is, she started making easy to cook foods for the kids. she also started giving them junk foods as snacks so that they wouldn't be that hungry for real meals. I chalked it up to her pregnancy nausea for the first few weeks but last week when I prepared an elaborate meal for the family on Sunday, the kids refused to even touch the food because they wanted the usual buttered noodles. So I told my wife that I'd be cooking all the meals from now onwards because the kids are getting spoiled from eating junk food all the time. She got mad at me and said that she's trying her hardest and I should be more appreciative. I told her no one forced her to cook and I had already suggested hiring a cook but she was the one who refused. She said that I don't understand her discomfort with having a cook and that hiring one was out of the question. She also told me that I can cook all meals if i think it is so easy to feed the kids healthy food. I told her that I would do just that. \n\nThat very night, I stayed up making different kinds of healthy food options for the week. Fruit salad, chicken stir fry, pasta sauce(with veggies, mushrooms and tomatoes then blended it all), cauliflower soup and banana bread. I froze everything so they can be reheated during the week. \n\nI have been just reheating food throughout the week and giving it to the kids. Since they want only noodles, I add the sauce and chicken stir fry to the noodles along with grated cheese. The just eat it without detecting any veggies in it. \n\nFor their school lunches I pack ham and cheese/tuna/chicken sandwiches the night before along with fruit salad and chocolate milk. They get a slice of banana bread for after school snack. Sandwiches and soup for dinner for me and my wife. \n\nMy wife told me the food tastes good but it's stale food so she doesn't think it's any better than what she used to cook for the family. I told her at least I was putting effort into the meals unlike her who was using the kids picky behavior as an excuse to be lazy. She got mad at me and said that she wasn't being lazy and that the kids really were picky. Now she's not speaking to me for the past 2 days. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1686148954, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143f3xo/aita_i_fed_my_kids_stale_food_and_called_my_wife/", "score": 8399, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Support, don\u2019t attack, each other.", "ESH. Soft one for you, for calling her lazy. Insults are a terrible thing to do.  Her for just giving up and refusing help and saying meal prep of healthy food is stale and no better than unhealthy food.", "ESH. You for calling her lazy and her for calling perfectly good food stale. She might not feel her best, so she is cooking easily made stuff. The kids got used to it and she now calls,  that them being picky. If you can maintain making stuff ahead of time, ok. You should apologize for the lazy statement, acknowledge her efforts when she is not feeling well, but you think either you cooking or hiring help is best. Ask her input, maybe you can get  fresh delivered meals so there won't be any strangers in the house. Maybe removing responsibility for main meals, she can help with making lunches.", "Nta I don't understand how it's stale I meal cook on weekends and that's what we eat all week. It saves time and the kids enjoy it.", "NTA, and here's why. I don't care that she is pregnant. You offered her many reasonable solutions. She insisted on being the one to cook and fucked up your kids eating habits and turned them into picky eaters by being lazy. let's be honest, doesn't matter why. Yes she is pregnant, and caring for two other kids, but if she couldn't continue to provide healthy meals, then she should have communicated that and asked for help and you two could have figured out a solution together. Then, once you realized that she wasn't handling it and she was not feeding your kids properly, then you took that pressure off of her and took on the task she clearly could not handle. (Again, doesn't matter that she is pregnant or why she can't handle it, she clearly can't handle it.) You didn't demand she work harder or fix it herself. You solved the issue and took on the task yourself. \n\nFurthermore, you're not feeding them stale food. And it's not the same as her shitty junk food unbalanced, unhealthy meals. What you are doing is meal planning/meal prep, and it's absolutely appropriate and healthy. And even recommended. The fact that she wants to belittle your effort to help her and feed them healthier meals, and take the pressure of her makes her a huge asshole. She should be fucking grateful. \n\nFinally, she wants to argue that the kids are picky. 1. They weren't picky until she MADE them picky by feeding them garbage. 2. They clearly are not THAT picky because they are eating what you are making. \n\nAlthough, calling her lazy probably didn't help your situation and probably makes you an ah in some ways. We all can't be perfect in our communications and maybe you need to work on that a little.", "Seems like ESH, you seem to be too over the top about making sure they have zero junk food (all that will lead to is problems in the future) and your wife is pregnant and probably tired so doesn't have the energy to cook even though she wants to cook healthy meals and is coming across as unappreciative of what you're doing. Maybe split the load, half prepped by you and the rest cooked by her. It's all about balance.", "ESH\n\nYou saw a need, offered a solution, she didn't like it, she offered an alternative, and you took her up on it. You didn't like what they were are eating so you offered solutions and are back to cooking & now pre-making their meals. Everything is fine so far...\n\nStale food? The food is frozen and reheated in a very short time period. Your wife seems to be frustrated and is taking it out on you. Her comments about the food are uncalled for. Also bear in mind that her tastes may off due to pregnancy. She should be understanding if this is a possibility.\n> I told her at least I was putting effort into the meals unlike her who was using the kids picky behavior as an excuse to be lazy. \n\nYou made a huge AH move by suggesting she doesn't put in effort and calling her lazy while dealing with being pregnant with your child. WTH?  I would be incensed.\n\nYou two need to communicate better. Both of you are stressed for different reasons. There's no need to take it out on each other. Kids absolutely have food preferences that spontaneously appear, disappear, and come back in different forms at that age. You act as if they aren't exposed to different foods around them at school and when they're out. You appear to have really strong feelings associated with food. Consider whether you're being overly harsh and using \"junk\" as a catchall for things that go against your preferences. That said, I'm so glad you are putting in the work and stepping in to assist your wife doing her pregnancy. You and your wife seem to have been able to work out creative solutions to your past disagreements. Keep trying to continue down that road. Both of you can be better for your own and each other's sakes. Apologies are needed on both ends.", "NTA.  Food that is fresh when frozen and later eaten within the week is still plenty fresh.  Sounds like your wife is being unreasonable and even stubborn.  Hopefully it's just the pregnancy hormones taking over.  Every mom (and dad) should care that their children eat well and I applaud your efforts to make this happen in your household.", "YTA. Your wife is not your enemy. Work together.", "NTA. I am a SAHM but hate cooking and have a super restrictive diet and can\u2019t eat what my 2 boys eat. My husband makes me food and the kids food and freezes individual portions.

Why don't you teach your wife a few easy meals? Or create a meal plan with her cooking 2 nights, and you cooking 3 nights?

This is a huge effort and you\u2019re setting your kids up for healthy eating habits in the future.", "ESH.

When you have no control over them, they will not know moderation.", "YTA \n\nPretty sure your initial assumption was right: she\u2019s struggling with the pregnancy. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with simpler foods for a time. Definitely not the end of the world. If you had a problem with it, you could have just suggested that you two work together and you can make sure that there are a couple of healthy things or see if there\u2019s a some simple healthy things she can make. Getting upset and telling her you\u2019re taking over was way too much. I mean she was stepping up so you could work more. \n\nAnd as someone who has had to do meal prep a week in advance, I see where she\u2019s coming from. It\u2019s not the end of the world but usually the food i prepared on Sunday would be not quite as nice as it was by Friday.", "NTA\n\nI can tell you want your kids to eat healthy, and working 70 hrs a week can make that nigh impossible with keeping a work/life balance. And the food isn't stale, so I don't know where your wife is getting that.\n\nI \\*might\\* give you a soft AH for calling your wife lazy. She's trying which I can give her kudos for, but calling her lazy I don't think is fair considering she's 20 weeks pregnant and cooking for two young children and you. Sounds like she's having a rough pregnancy, so try to communicate better with what you want for your kid's and their meals as well as show a little understand.", "NTA -I totally get it bc I've lived it. The food isn't stale. Your wife is just picky and peeved - and you can chalk it up the pregnancy. I don't cook bc I want to- it's bc I think it is important to have balanced meals and setup good eating habits. When I travel for work- I prep all meals ahead of time and label each container. Kudos to you for offering to get a cook (I use a company that will make fresh healthy meals and deliver -so that's a great idea and it works when I have to be away for extended trips.", "ESH. Reheated food isn\u2019t stale, but you\u2019re kinda being a dick to your wife and she\u2019s being stubborn at this point. She knows the food isn\u2019t stale, and you know she hasn\u2019t been poisoning your kids by letting them eat carbs.", "ESH. She\u2019s pregnant , not lazy. And frozen food isn\u2019t stale.

Is this some elitism over it being reheated?", "INFO: What exactly is considered \"junk food\" here? It is not uncommon for my kids to just want buttered noodles then the next day want veggies with their meal. What was she feeding them in place of meals?", "YTA for calling your pregnant wife \"lazy,\" when you clearly have different operating abilities when it comes to food/meals.\n\nTake some time for  \u2728communication\u2728 and meal prep together instead of just name calling.\n\nAlso? Not all meals need to be \"healthy.\" Everything in moderation, including moderation.", "ESH- you are both fighting against each other when you both could sit down and TALK about meal plan for the week. Share ideas on what you can cook on the weekends and what she can do on the week days.  If she wants fresh food then you can show her how to do some of the dishes you make.  \n\nAnd yes to me, reheating frozen foods of some types does taste stale, doesnt mean they are stale just texture is different.  stir fry is one thing I can't eat reheated but is also something pretty easy to make fresh.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The way she likely heard your statement is that \"you're a bad parent and there is no use talking about why; I'll just parent for you.\"\n\nThen you get into the blame game. She says (in response to the implied criticism) that she is trying her hardest and you should appreciate that. Rather than expressing your appreciation or recognizing that you were criticizing her work or acknowledging how she was struggling, you argue she shouldn't feel hard-pressed in the first place because she chose to cook: \"no one forced her to cook\" may be technically true, but it sets a confrontational tone instead of trying to get to the heart of the problem with her.\n\nI don't get the sense of partnership from how you two talk. In the later conversation, your wife says the food tastes good but it's stale and thus not better than what she made. So I disagree with her on the \"stale\" point, but that's not the issue. She is obviously responding to the earlier conversation where you called her out for making \"junk food all the time.\" Rather than try to defuse that earlier nugget or acknowledge the compliment or even argue your point of view about why the food is better, you go for *insults*: \"at least I was putting effort into the meals unlike her who was using the kids picky behavior as an excuse to be lazy.\" In one string, you call her lazy, suggest she wasn't putting forth effort (without ever asking why she was struggling or how you could help), and pin their pickiness firmly on her rather than exploring why they were picky.\n\nHonestly, if I had a partner who talked down to me like you did, I wouldn't want to talk to you either. What you're doing isn't *telling it like it is* or anything virtuous like that; it's picking fights and ordering your wife around rather than asking questions, listening, and getting to the bottom of what to do together.

Just guessing, but she might be embarrassed by the idea of hiring a cook. She may feel (especially with pregnancy hormones wreaking havoc on her emotions) that it makes her a bad mother to not be able to feed her kids. Do you both come from the same socioeconomic background? Is it strange to her to hire a cook? And look at where you\u2019re both coming from on food stances. Feeding your children healthy food is important. But is what she\u2019s feeding them actually unhealthy, or does it just not meet your standards? Snacks aren\u2019t bad. Simple \u201ceasy to cook\u201d meals aren\u2019t bad. Again, do you have the same backgrounds? Are these foods normal to her?

Freezing food actually locks in nutrients that would be lost from other preservation methods (frozen fruit is oftentimes more nutritious than \"fresh\" fruit that's been shuffled around supermarkets for several months before reaching your shelf.\n\nThe suggestion of a chef, if your household budget can afford it, is very reasonable. If your wife is concerned about having another person in the house, well, that's what interviews are for. Find someone she likes and is comfortable being alone around.

Of course she fell back on comfort and easy foods - most beginner cooks do, especially ones who have other, more important things going on, like pregnancy. Next, your kids prefer her food. This is not an insult to you. Kids love basic foods. Kids love fat and sugar because we are genetically predisposed to those for survival. They will grow out of it. By exposing them to new and healthy foods so long like you have been, their picky stages will probably last less long than other kids. I couldn\u2019t eat onions until I was 21, so it could be a lot worse. With the leftovers, I would say your wife is in the wrong, but also I cannot eat most leftovers because the texture of reheating makes me want to throw up. If she\u2019s never had problems in the past with leftovers, I assume the comment of it being stale was about something else, but still not right of her to say. \n\nLastly, calling your wife lazy is why I have to give you a YTA. It doesn\u2019t have to do with her pregnancy. She\u2019s trying a new skill and trying to figure out something she\u2019s unfamiliar with for the kids. Instead of supporting her, you insult her choices and character. How does that help the person you\u2019re supposed to love? Did she ever call you lazy when you tried to cook and made a more basic meal? If she was lazy, why would she even want to start in the first place?

Dude, she's not lazy she's pregnant.  From the sounds of it you have always done all the cooking, so she hasn't ever had to.  She is trying even if you think what she is doing isn't the way you would do it.  While hiring someone to cook seems like the perfect option she clearly just isn't comfortable with it.  Maybe it's embarrassing to her that she isn't a great cook.  Might I suggest you make her meal kits with instructions that she basically has to just put in the pan and cook.  If you are doing something just for a few days you don't need to cook it, just get it ready and leave it in the fridge so she can do it.  For stir fry cut everything up and get the sauce ready so it's ready to cook and then tell her what to do.  Cut up the fruit in the fridge so it's ready to go, get healthy snacks like carrots and dip ready in individual containers so the girls can grab them for themselves, make your veggie pasta sauce and then just refrigerate it so she can just pop it in a pan to warm up and make the pasta.  It could be that the stale that she is tasting is from freezer burn, so that's why I am saying don't freeze it if it will be used in the next few days.  It will be fine in the fridge for a few days.

The kids need good food even if it's for one meal a day (I would put money on it they trade food at lunches) and there is a very good chance that they are being picky for your wife and not for you. Maybe they don't like their moms cooking, I mean, you said you've done all of it up until this point. \n\nBut on the other hand, calling a pregnant woman lazy is a really dumb way to die. For all you know she could literally be trying her best and it might not be enough for your daughters because, as you said, up until recently you've been the one cooking. It's honestly laughable that you think you were justified to say that. Not to mention she's having a late-in-life baby and probably isn't handling pregnancy as well as she has in the past. \n\nThis is very complicated.

I have worked 72hrs/week and that leaves about NO time to cook for a family because that is 12hrs/day 6days/wk. You would be eating dinner at bedtime if you cooked for a family. So I think you are embellishing your hours. Kids can be picky and then they can be \"too picky\" and that is where you and your wife as parents need to put your foot down. There is an allowable amount of \"pickiness\" because I am sure there are certain things that you don't like to eat yourself.

There's no real way to judge what she's fed them.\n\nSecondly, \"pretending pregnant women are completely helpless\" is a far cry from calling a pregnant woman lazy. This man is working 70+ hours a week. They already have 2 children together. That means that this woman is likely taking over a large chunk of the childcare and chores that they used to share. That's ALSO work, and it can be exhausting by the time dinner rolls around, especially when you are already using twice as much energy to grow a human being. Im pregnant. I usually make all the meals for my family- big, elaborate things like OP makes- but there are days when I just can't. The kids have been too much, or it feels like the baby grew overnight, or I didn't get any sleep because of pelvic pain, or Ive thrown up all morning, and while I wanted to make osso bucco that plan is now out the window and Im making buttered noodles or ordering takeout. The kids will survive one night without vegetables. I would be LIVID at anyone who dared call me lazy or tried to sound feminist by saying \"oh pregnant women arent weak little babies!\" When what they are ACTUALLY doing is invalidating my experiences and feelings. If you talked like that to a disabled, injured, or depressed person, you'd be rightfully called out as ableist, but for some reason when you tell women they should pretend pregnancy doesnt affect them in any way, its supposed to be empowering? \n\nThirdly, OP is TA for biting the hand that feeds him-literally. My husband rarely helps in the kitchen, but he's helped a ton on nights that I need to tap out. I DONT expect the food he makes to be the same quality as what I would. Getting angry at your partner for not doing things the exact same way you would is being ungrateful, and nobody likes to be yelled at or criticized or called lazy because their attempts weren't good enough.

Different strokes and all that", "I have two kids. \n\n1. The wife is not allowing him to hire a chef. This impacts his life. Her reasons are arbitrary. \n2. She is feeding the kids poorly.

As a result, the husband who is working 70 hours a week is now preparing all of the meals. Instead of being grateful she's being completely ridiculous, attacking the food for being \"stale,\" despite the fact that it's just pre-prepared. \n\nAt no point is she being reasonable. Her behavior is impacting her kids, her husband, and really herself, because you need to have a good diet while pregnant (for example, iron deficiency is pretty common). \n\nPregnancy isn't easy, but it is if you have amazing support.

In another 10 years I don\u2019t think I\u2019d make it through a 70-hour work week without a heart attack. I\u2019ve told my boss (luckily I have both a boss and a company culture I already knew would back me 100% on this) that the minute kids enter the mix, I will not be physically able to do a week that long ever again, and I won\u2019t be making anyone on my team do it instead either, even if they don\u2019t have kids.", "These same people probably eat trash and see no problem with it, this is Reddit after all.", "She wasn't being lazy, I think, she is simply pregnant and not an ambitious enough cook.

Those dried noodles can last up to two years, and grocery stores are certainly going to keep them on the shelf as long as long as they legally can.  Also consider that, unlike dried noodles, most junk food lasts so long due to the random, complex, non-nutritional compounds added simply to prevent spoilage.", "I also think you need to get on the same page about the importance of nutrition for you and the kids. It sounds like you are prioritizing nutrient dense foods and perhaps your wife doesn\u2019t understand the value/importance of setting your kids up to be healthy curious eaters throughout their lives. Coming together on why that\u2019s important is also one way to find common ground and help her understand why you were upset. I would also explain (nicely) that frozen food isn\u2019t stale and that the freezer retains nutrients very well. \n\nShe clearly snapped at you because her feelings were hurt. I doubt that you two are that far apart on these values once you talk it out. \n\nObviously calling her lazy was not helpful. I\u2019m sure you are both exhausted and trying your best. I also doubt that your wife really prefers just giving kids buttered noodles, but that may be as much as she\u2019s able to do right now.

Someone cannot drill that into your head. They need to research and learn it themselves which takes time, until then it's the wife who is being insensitive to the children's needs.\n\nNTA at all OP.

Bad habits will creep in fast and even affect the mind and personality, don't let your children suffer because your partner is piling on silly excuses.", "You say this like cooking is the ONLY chore in the house. Is op doing any other chores or just cooking? Does op take on any of the childcare duties when he's at home besides cooking? Like bath time or bed time routine or simply taking them outside to play? Maybe he does or maybe she does everything else. Does the wife also work? We don't know they're entire schedule. And she's also pregnant with \"severe symptoms\". You try doing housework, cooking, and running after two kids while being off balance, throwing up 24/7, and with severe back/hip pain that can make movement difficult.

You\u2019re acting as if you\u2019re competing to be the better parent or something, but it should be a team effort. \n\nYou\u2019re wrong for calling your wife lazy. She\u2019s never been the main cook in your household but wanted to try, and struggled to keep up with the demand of balanced home cooked meals every night - that isn\u2019t laziness. You mention her pregnancy symptoms are severe, and severe symptoms can be very disabling. Having a disability myself, there are some days I just *can\u2019t* cook at all, let alone a full healthy and balanced meal - and I\u2019m the primary cook in my household, typically used to the time and labor that entails. Your wife isn\u2019t used to it. \n\nYou\u2019re also wrong for your relationship with food. Kids are far more likely to develop negative thoughts about food when they\u2019re told certain things are bad or junk. It\u2019s far healthier for them to learn to enjoy these comfort foods and snacks in moderation than to deny them altogether. \n\nYour wife is wrong for lashing out and calling prepped meals stale, it simply isn\u2019t true. \n\nRemember, your kids are watching. They\u2019re watching as you work 70 hour weeks and come home and obsess over the food being up to your standards. They\u2019re watching as you and your wife fight. They\u2019re watching as you insult and hurt each other. They\u2019re learning that these things are normal, when they shouldn\u2019t be. \n\nYou both need to step up and put your egos aside and accept that a compromise needs to be made in the meals prepared, or you and your wife will just come to resent each other.", "You know what's REALLY exhausting?\n\nWorking 70 hours a week and coming home to someone who won't put in the effort to cook decent meals for the kids, won't accept help when it is offered, and ending up cooking the meals your own damned self, only to be told that they're 'stale' because they need to be heated.\n\nThat's exhausting.

I remember when my mom was pregnant with my brother that was all she could stand, so the rest of us ate it a lot too.\n\nThe suggestions about getting a meal subscription like hellofresh sound like a good alternative.

ESPECIALLY if you\u2019re feeding them \u201cjunk food as snacks so they won\u2019t be hungry for real meals.\u201d That makes my blood boil. Children should absolutely never be deprived of proper meals and eating habits. Not in a million years.\n\nAnd considering homemade, meal-prepped food that\u2019s been frozen for a week or less as \u201cstale\u201d is so incredibly wrong.

I'm not interested in pushing \"gender wars\" in every discussion as it's tiring and useless, but this thread deserves a special callout as there is enough evidence of men and women getting different amounts of empathy here. A man who doesn't trust strangers aka professionals cooks/cleaners in their house is paranoid, toxic and/or selfish, and a woman who doesn't trust strangers aka professionals is scared and looking after themselves or her children. This extra empathy towards women, or lack of empathy towards men, is a popular enough narrative here that it outweighs any misogynistic \"women bad\" comments that pop up here. The pendulum has swung to the other side now."]}
