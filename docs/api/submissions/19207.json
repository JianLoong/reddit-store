My wife is pregnant with our third kid now. She's 20 weeks pregnant. \n\nSo my daughters have never been picky about their food since I used to cook all meals and never introduced them to junk food. However, about 2 months back I was assigned to a new project at work and started working long hours(70/week) so I have been unable to cook as often now. I wanted to hire a cook because my wife was having severe pregnancy symptoms but my wife said she wanted to try cooking for our kids and she also didn't like the idea of a stranger at our house. I agreed to her idea since she suggested it herself. \n\nFor the first month or so, she cooked pretty diligently for the kids and both of us as well. however, after that, she reduced the quality of the meals. What I mean is, she started making easy to cook foods for the kids. she also started giving them junk foods as snacks so that they wouldn't be that hungry for real meals. I chalked it up to her pregnancy nausea for the first few weeks but last week when I prepared an elaborate meal for the family on Sunday, the kids refused to even touch the food because they wanted the usual buttered noodles. So I told my wife that I'd be cooking all the meals from now onwards because the kids are getting spoiled from eating junk food all the time. She got mad at me and said that she's trying her hardest and I should be more appreciative. I told her no one forced her to cook and I had already suggested hiring a cook but she was the one who refused. She said that I don't understand her discomfort with having a cook and that hiring one was out of the question. She also told me that I can cook all meals if i think it is so easy to feed the kids healthy food. I told her that I would do just that. \n\nThat very night, I stayed up making different kinds of healthy food options for the week. Fruit salad, chicken stir fry, pasta sauce(with veggies, mushrooms and tomatoes then blended it all), cauliflower soup and banana bread. I froze everything so they can be reheated during the week. \n\nI have been just reheating food throughout the week and giving it to the kids. Since they want only noodles, I add the sauce and chicken stir fry to the noodles along with grated cheese. The just eat it without detecting any veggies in it. \n\nFor their school lunches I pack ham and cheese/tuna/chicken sandwiches the night before along with fruit salad and chocolate milk. They get a slice of banana bread for after school snack. Sandwiches and soup for dinner for me and my wife. \n\nMy wife told me the food tastes good but it's stale food so she doesn't think it's any better than what she used to cook for the family. I told her at least I was putting effort into the meals unlike her who was using the kids picky behavior as an excuse to be lazy. She got mad at me and said that she wasn't being lazy and that the kids really were picky. Now she's not speaking to me for the past 2 days. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1686148954, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143f3xo/aita_i_fed_my_kids_stale_food_and_called_my_wife/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Honestly, I feel like the solution too this whole issue is doordash.", "ESH. You and your wife need to sit down and reevaluate your needs and expectations as parents. Support, don\u2019t attack, each other.", "ESH. Soft one for you, for calling her lazy. Insults are a terrible thing to do.  Her for just giving up and refusing help and saying meal prep of healthy food is stale and no better than unhealthy food.", "ESH. You for calling her lazy and her for calling perfectly good food stale. She might not feel her best, so she is cooking easily made stuff. The kids got used to it and she now calls,  that them being picky. If you can maintain making stuff ahead of time, ok. You should apologize for the lazy statement, acknowledge her efforts when she is not feeling well, but you think either you cooking or hiring help is best. Ask her input, maybe you can get  fresh delivered meals so there won't be any strangers in the house. Maybe removing responsibility for main meals, she can help with making lunches.", "Nta I don't understand how it's stale I meal cook on weekends and that's what we eat all week. It saves time and the kids enjoy it.", "NTA, and here's why. I don't care that she is pregnant. Yoh offered her many reasonable solutions. She insisted on being the one to cook and fucked upnyour kids eating habits and turned them into picky eaters by being lazy. let's be honest, doesn't matter why. Yes she is pregnant ,and caring for two other kids, but if she couldn't continue to provide healthy meals, then she should have communicated that and asked for help and you two could have figured out a solution together. Then, once you realized that she wasn't handling it and she was not feeding your kids properly, then you took that pressure off of and took on the task she clearly could not handle. (Again, doesn't matter that she is pregnant or why she can't handle it, she clearly can't handle it.) You didn't demand she work harder or fix it herself. You solved the issue and took on the task yourself. \n\nFurthermore, you're not feeding them stale food. And it's not the same as her shitty junk food unbalanced, unhealthy meals. What you are doing is meal planning/meal prep, and it's absolutely appropriate and healthy. And even recommended. The fact that she wants to belittle your effort to help her and feed them healthier meals, and take the pressure of her makes her a huge asshole. She should be fucking grateful. \n\nFinally, she wants to argue that the kids are picky. 1. They weren't ouxky until she MADE them picky by feeding them garbage. 2. They clearly are THAT picky because they are eating what you are making. \n\nAlthough, calling her lazy probably didn't help your situation and probably makes you an ah in some ways. We all can't be perfect in our communications and maybe you need to work on that a little.", "Seems like ESH, you seem to be too over the top about making sure they have zero junk food (all that will lead to is problems in the future) and your wife is pregnant and probably tired so doesn't have the energy to cook even though she wants to cook healthy meals and is coming across as unappreciative of what you're doing. Maybe split the load, half prepped by you and the rest cooked by her. It's all about balance.", "ESH\n\nYou saw a need, offered a solution, she didn't like it, she offered an alternative, and you took her up on it. You didn't like what were are eating so you offered solutions and are back to cooking & now pre-making their meals. Everything is fine so far...\n\nStale food? The food is frozen and reheated in a very short time period. Your wife seems to be frustrated and is taking it out on you. Her comment about the food or uncalled for. \n> I told her at least I was putting effort into the meals unlike her who was using the kids picky behavior as an excuse to be lazy. \n\nYou made a huge AH move by suggesting she doesn't put in effort and calling her lazy while dealing with being pregnant with your child. WTH?  I would be incensed.\n\nYou two need to communicate better. Both of you are stressed for different reasons. There's no need to take it out on each other. Kids absolutely have food preferences that spontaneously appear, disappear, and come back in different forms at that age. You act as if they aren't exposed to different foods around them at school and when they're out. You appear to have really strong feelings associated with food. Consider whether you're being overly harsh and using \"junk\" as a catchall for things that go against your preferences. That said, I'm so glad you are putting in the work and stepping in to assist your wife doing her pregnancy. You and your wife seem to have been able to work out creative solutions to your past disagreements. Keep trying to continue down that road. Both of you can be better for you own and each other's sakes. Apologies are needed on both ends.", "NTA.  Food that is fresh when frozen and later eaten within the week is still plenty fresh.  Sounds like your wife is being unreasonable and even stubborn.  Hopefully it's just the pregnancy hormones taking over.  Every mom (and dad) should care that their children eat well and I applaud your efforts to make this happen in your household.", "YTA. Your wife is not your enemy. Work together.", "NTA. I am a SAHM but hate cooking and have a super restrictive diet and can\u2019t eat what my 2 boys eat. My husband makes me food and the kids food and freezes individual portions. It\u2019s definitely not stale and it\u2019s a super nice thing to do.", "Asking her to cook from scratch, every night, is a lot for someone who doesn't have the skillset, then you pile on kids who can be picky \u2014 because, yes, they are being picky \u2014 plus pregnancy. Why don't you teach your wife a few easy meals? Or create a meal plan with her cooking 2 nights, and you cooking 3 nights? It doesn't need to be all or nothing.\n\nAnd you need to work on your communication and empathy. \"Lazy\"? SMDH. You owe her a huge apology. YTA.", "NTA. That\u2019s not stale.

This is a huge effort and you\u2019re setting your kids up for healthy eating habits in the future.", "ESH. Work together to fight against the problem not each other. \n\nSide note, show your kids limitations with junk food. When you have no control over them, they will not know moderation.", "YTA \n\nPretty sure your initial assumption was right: she\u2019s struggling with the pregnancy. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with simpler foods for a time. Definitely not the end of the world. If you had a problem with it, you could have just suggested that you two work together and you can make sure that there are a couple of healthy things or see if there\u2019s a some simple healthy things she can make. Getting upset and telling her you\u2019re taking over was way too much. I mean she was stepping up so you could work more. \n\nAnd as someone who has had to do meal prep a week in advance, I see where she\u2019s coming from. It\u2019s not the end of the world but usually the food i prepared on Sunday would be not quite as nice as it was by Friday.", "NTA\n\nI can tell you want your kids to eat healthy, and working 70 hrs a week can make that nigh impossible with keeping a work/life balance. And the food isn't stale, so I don't know where your wife is getting that.\n\nI \\*might\\* give you a soft AH for calling your wife lazy. She's trying which I can give her kudos for, but calling her lazy I don't think is fair considering she's 20 weeks pregnant and cooking for two young children and you. Sounds like she's having a rough pregnancy, so try to communicate better with what you want for your kid's and their meals as well as show a little understand.", "NTA -I totally get it bc I've lived it. The food isn't stale. Your wife is just picky and peeved - and you can chalk it up the pregnancy. I don't cook bc I want to- it's bc I think it is important to have balanced meals and setup good eating habits. When I travel for work- I prep all meals ahead of time and label each container. Kudos to you for offering to get a cook (I use a company that will make fresh healthy meals and deliver -so that's a great idea and it works when I have to be away for extended trips.", "ESH. Reheated food isn\u2019t stale, but you\u2019re kinda being a dick to your wife and she\u2019s being stubborn at this point. She knows the food isn\u2019t stale, and you know she hasn\u2019t been poisoning your kids by letting them eat carbs.", "ESH. She\u2019s pregnant , not lazy. And frozen food isn\u2019t stale.

You knew she was struggling before this, you know she's stubborn, she's pregnant, and you still call her names? \n\nYou clearly have no problem meal prepping, so why don't you help more?", "ESH\n\nShe was looking for a fight at the end of it, and you just gave it to her with your comment.", "I don't understand how the food is \"stale\"? Is this some elitism over it being reheated?", "INFO: What exactly is considered \"junk food\" here? It is not uncommon for my kids to just want buttered noodles then the next day want veggies with their meal. What was she feeding them in place of meals?", "YTA for calling your pregnant wife \"lazy,\" when you clearly have different operating abilities when it comes to food/meals.\n\nTake some time for  \u2728communication\u2728 and meal prep together instead of just name calling.\n\nAlso? Not all meals need to be \"healthy.\" Everything in moderation, including moderation.", "ESH- you are both fighting against each other when you both could sit down and TALK about meal plan for the week. Share ideas on what you can cook on the weekends and what she can do on the week days.  If she wants fresh food then you can show her how to do some of the dishes you make.  \n\nAnd yes to me, reheating frozen foods of some types does taste stale, doesnt mean they are stale just texture is different.  stir fry is one thing I can't eat reheated but is also something pretty easy to make fresh.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
