Not a lot of damaged on the front left side of my bumper- scratched and some paint come off. My car is new new- Came on the road March 2022. So if I fix the bumper it has to be done at the dealership since its new and still under warranty.    \nAKA its expensive- 3 day fix because the whole bumper has to come off and painted etc.   \nHis insurance is going to increase because of this 'claim'.   \nThe cost to fix this bumper is not worth the damage imo-If I had to pay it out of pocket, I wouldn't fix it.  The car is drivable and is it's not very noticeable damage. I wouldn't fix it either if I caused the damage.  But the damage is there.  \n\n\nThe co worker was a dickhead. He talked down to me and was talking to me like HES THE MAN and I am a 'woman'- if that makes sense. He didn't want to take the blame for hitting my car and kept saying I hit him- when I did not. My car was in Park when he reversed into me. His car hit my car.   \nAfter a while (a hour going back and forth) I did become unpleasant towards him because he was acting like a dickhead. He never apologized for hitting my car.   \n\n\nHere is where I don't know if I am the asshole.   \nI don't know if I should fix my car. The damage isn't a lot, his insurance is going to go up for the next couple years because the fix is expensive (about 30% of his monthly salary), and he's my co worker probably for the next X years (not a direct co worker, didn't know him before this) and we live in a small town.   \n\n\nOn the other hand, My car is brand new, and he was a dick. \n\n  \nSo should I get this fixed? would I be the ass hole if I got this fixed?", "created_utc": 1676374239, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11236s9/aita_going_thru_insurance_when_co_worker_hit_my/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s very simple, your car has lost value due to his action. He messed up and needs to be be responsible. Period.", "NTA, you should get the car fixed.   \nAt some point in the future you'll likely go to trade in the vehicle or sell it, and this damage will come up if its not fixed and SIGNIFICANTLY reduce the value.  Personally if I was purchasing a car, and unfixed damage came up, it'd be a deal breaker as you would wonder \"what else is wrong that they didnt take care of?\"   \n\n\nAlso going through insurance, especially if it's someone you have to deal with again, is the best way.  Just say \"Oh cause the car is under lease I'm required by my lease agreement to go through insurance\"  (Lie about it being a lease if you have to lol)   \n\n\nThat way you can keep any issues at arm lengths.  \"Oh I'm sorry the insurance made you have an enema, I didnt have any choice, lease agreement made me go through insurance\" :D", ">\tand he was a dick\n\nSo now he gets to pay the asshole tax\n\nNTA", "NTA your car is worth less with damage.\n Get it repaired, everything else is not your problem from his end. Hopefully a  police report was filed.", "Fix the car! Nta, he backed into you and that is why he pays for insurance. You can also depending on the state go after his insurance company for diminishment of value. It won't be much but this is your only chance to claim it. Fix the car and have his insurance pay. They will put you in a rental car and take care of everything.", "NTA insurance always. People are dicks and will go back on handshake agreements.", "Yeah, NTA. If he wants to be disrespectful, he gets what he gets. Good on you for covering your behind.", "Nta. The other guy is an asshole. Fix that car. Fuck his insurance. That's a him problem not a you problem. Alternatively if you feel generous. you can offer to take the full money off him cash if he prefers. Otherwise screw that guy.", "NTA. I wouldn't care about something like this, but if the person who hit me tried to shift the blame and talk down to me, yeah, I would go get it repaired through their insurance. \n\nYou don't owe this coworker anything, especially if they are going to be a jerk about the whole ordeal. Your car lost value, and you were willing to take the lost until they decided to be a dick about it.  Actions have consequences, and in this case, buddy hit your car. Your brand new car now has less value because of it. He needs to rectify this whether it is at his expense or his insurance. \n\nI suggest going through his insurance because if you let him pay for the repairs, he might decide after the car is fixed, not to pay up, and you'd have to fork over the money yourself. He already tried to shift the blame on you. He'll try and not pay you if you give him the opportunity", "NTA. Funny, his insurance is the one to pay, yet he tried to tell you it was your fault. That\u2019s not how that works.   \n\nAsk If he wants to pay out of pocket to fix it without going through insurance, then maybe\u2026but by all means get it fixed.  If he agrees to that though, he pays the dealer UP FRONT.  he will never reimburse you after the fact just get that straight.\n\nHe hit you, he pays, one way or another.", "NTA. Get your car fixed, and invest in 360 degree dash camera.", "Fly around and find out.\n\nHe's got it coming to him.\n\nPut it on your insurance.\n\nNTA", "He is going to be an ah no matter what you do, based on his behaviour. You could have considered his situation if he had apologised and offered to pay. Instead, he chose to try and bully you. Consider this- if you back off now, would he continue to bully you as a soft target at the workplace? NTA.", "Does your building have security cameras? Might be worth getting hold of a copy of what happened if it does. Yes, he should pay up, his insurance should cover it, that's what it's for. If he continues to be an ass about this, go talk to HR, you shouldn't have to pay multiple times in multiple ways for his mistake.", "You're NTA. He needs to be held responsible for his carelessness. If he does not want his insurance to go up, he can pay it all out of pocket. You shouldn't have to drive a flawed new car because he doesn't want to own his mistake. You shouldn't have the potential resale of your vehicle impacted, either.", "NTA. Put it on your insurance, get your car fixed and next time call the police so you have witnesses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome people try to intimidate others so they can get of scot free and without having to pay.", "He damaged your car and you are pondering not fixing it so his insurance doesn't go up. \n\nHas he offered to pay for the damage without involving insurance? If so you might consider that as an option, where he pays in advance directly to the dealership. But if he did not offer to pay the damage your only option is to go through insurance.\n\nYou can let him damage your car and walk away with it.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. This is why he has insurance. Fix your new car and feel zero guilt.", "NTA. If he had been apologetic and nice, I'd offer to let him pay me the cash instead of going through insurance, but now, no way. Get your car fixed, and go forth with a clean conscience!", "The point of insurance is to either give you back what you had before the accident (a shiny new car with no damage) or try to compensate you for things that can\u2019t be fixed (permanent injuries, etc).  So it\u2019s generally reasonable to use insurance for repairs.\n\nIt really sounds like he was trying to intimidate you out of reporting the accident to his insurance, which IMO is a perfectly sound reason to dig in and refuse to be brow-beaten.  That type behave that way because of how often it works for them.\n\nETA: Also, your state may have a reporting law that requires you to report damage above a certain dollar amount, which is sometimes surprisingly low.  Your insurance almost certainly has a clause that requires the same.  So you could genuinely get yourself into trouble for not reporting it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This will affect someone financially: him now, with an insurance hike; you later, if you want to sell or trade in your car. The financial hit should be on the person who caused the accident.", "NTA - his premiums are going up because of his shitty driving into a parked car, that\u2019s on him. I would probably inform hr incase there\u2019s any retaliation at work.", "NTA. Get your car fixed. This was his direct fault and responsibility. You are not responsible for his insurance going up, he is.  He could not be bothered to even apologize. Actions have consequences.", "NTA however your co worker can claim either this never happend or that you hit him considering you waited a few days and it doesnt seem like you got a police report", "NTA get your car fixed. \n\nIf you let him bully you out of it there\u2019s a good chance he\u2019ll always take the bully route with you. Personally I\u2019d rather the office asshole hate me than see me as an easy target.", "Whatever you do or don't this guy is going to be an ass. He is going to complain about you & be generally unpleasant when recounting the event to his colleague & family.\n\nSo cover your backside & have your car fixed via his insurance.\n\nFor me this is not about fixing your car, this is about making sure his responsibility is officially recognized through proper channels (and you can defend yourself when inevitably you'll be badmouthed)\n\nMoreover, why would you suffer this loss ? What if at some point you need cash & need to sell your car ? Through no fault of your own you'll get much less that can be expected.\n\nEdit to say : NTA", "NTA, if he said he is sorry, you could've skipped on the fix, but with him being a dick, just proceed with the insurance, plus your car is brand new, why do you have to lower itsy cost (if ever sold) coz of this moron, who doesn't know how to say sorry?", "NTA.  I'd claim just to piss him off at this point.", "Nah if he was being a condescending dick like you said then get your car fixed however you want. He made a mistake now he has to deal with the fallout. NTA.", "Why would you choose to live with the damage his action caused? Put it through insurance. \n\nNTA. \n\nOh - he knows he\u2019s wrong. He\u2019s attempted to pressure/bully you because he\u2019s the man and you\u2019re \u201cjust\u201d a girl.", "NTA, but should have gotten Police report.", "NTA. Let the insurance take care of the issue. First that is their job, and second there is no guarantee that he will honour any commitment when it comes to paying. Then you will be stuck with the bill or going to small claims court. Finally the AH tax of just not owning upto his mistake.", "Get it fixed, because it\u2019s not good for the resale value to leave it. Give him the choice of paying out of pocket or going through insurance (although going through insurance may end up causing the repair to go on Carfax).\n\nNTA.", ">Here is where I don't know if I am the asshole.\nI don't know if I should fix my car. \n\nReally? You're really having having this dilemma? You also think people are going to possibly side with the general asshole who wasn't paying attention while driving?\n\nThere's no issue. He did something wrong that was really avoidable and is facing natural consequences of that. You just want validation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Report it to your insurance immediately. You should have done that the day it happened. Depending on if you have full coverage or only liability, your insurance can go after his insurance. You wouldn\u2019t have to do more than give a statement. Damage will compound over time if not fixed. Wear and tear, plus rust, will degrade the bumper.

If he doesn't want to go through insurance, he can pay the dealer directly up front.  Do not let him \"reimburse you\" or settle up after the work is done.  You will never see that money.

If it's going to a dealership it's definitely going to show up. You can do a search for shops on Carfax ahead of time to see if they participate."]}
