You can ask and say \u201chey while you\u2019re up, can you get me X? I\u2019ll pay you back/get the next one.\u201d But to just expect someone to buy a round of drinks when you haven\u2019t even finished yours? It sounds a bit ridiculous to me.

Then you went to get a drink, and they didn't ask for one, but decided that was rude. Double standards don't work.", "NTA. No one should expect someone else to buy them a drink. \n\nBut in the future if/when you offer to buy rounds. Don\u2019t buy them with the intention/hope that you\u2019ll be made even. That\u2019s not what it\u2019s about.", "I feel like they are taking crazy pills. NTA", "There are 3 options when visiting a pub.\n\n1. The round system- where each person buys drinks for everyone each time they go up, taking it in turns to buy drinks.\n\n2. The whip system- where everyone puts a certain amount in a whip to buy everyone\u2019s drinks from.\n\n3. The individual system- where people are responsible for buying their own drinks (often the fairest if there is uneven drinking).\n\nUsually it\u2019s best to establish what system is being used before drinking so everyone knows what to expect. However it sounds as if your sister has set the precedent for option 3 by not buying you and your partner a drink when she got hers. If at no point they bought, or even offered to buy, you a drink there should be no expectation that you would buy for them. Definitely NTA, it\u2019s not like she bought for you and you didn\u2019t reciprocate.", "So they never bought you a drink but expected you to buy them drinks\n\nNTA   bah that  Since THEY failed to buy you drinks, then they outed themselves as RUDE at the first pub", "NTA.  They were looking for free drinks, and got upset when it didn't happen.", "No, it\u2019s not \u201cbasic etiquette\u201d. It\u2019s simply a nice thing to do if you have the money. NTA", "NTA. Unless this is a place that lends out trays (which I have only seen One place and that was because half the group I was with practically lived there) you can only safely carry two drinks.\n\nWhy would you give one of those drinks to anyone but your so if they want one?", "They had been up to get drinks multiple times already, where was their \"basic etiquette\" then? Did they ask you what you wanted AND GOTTEN IT at all that evening? NTA", "NTA. \n\nThey didn\u2019t get you a drink at the first pub, right?! So they got their just desserts, IMO. But you didn\u2019t do it to be petty, by the sounds of it. I\u2019m just a petty Betty that way. \n\nAnd this is why whenever I go out, I say I don\u2019t buy rounds, I\u2019ll just cover my own drinks. We don\u2019t \u201cdo\u201d rounds, we just each get our own drinks. Plus, I\u2019m single, so if I go out with a couple, I need to buy them 2 drinks to their buying me 1. So it\u2019s not exactly even.", "thanks, I mean, I would say where I am from it DOES commonly happen, but I fucking hate that for being the one to go and get a drink your reward is getting everyone else one too. Usually it's unspoken etiquette WHEN YOU ARE DOING ROUNDS AND WILL BE EVEN AT THE END OF THE NIGHT", "Exactly. It sounds like THEY are the assholes", "I mean sometimes in the UK it's an unspoken rule if you're in a group setting and doing rounds, but that's usually discussed in advance (\"Oh let's go for a couple of rounds of drinks\" etc etc). However, even then it's not enforced at all and is usually just based on people's personal preference for buying drinks for others. \n\nIs it polite to ask? Maybe but it's very contextual but it shouldn't be a cause of argument if someone doesn't. I wouldn't even dream of getting upset if someone bought their own drinks and didn't offer me one.", "Depends where you live in, the UK in a small gathering, it's good manners to offer. You don't have to for table of 20 or whatever, but a table of 4, it is basically good manners that you offer.", "that was MY thought too.\n\nTHEY asked then failed to get OP a drink.", "i actually dont think they cared about the cost of the drink", "exactly, not doing a nice thing doesnt mean you have done a bad thing. I hate how favours are now seen as standard practice, no one appreciates it when you do it, but when you dont do it they have a go at you.", "I wasn't doing it to be petty though, as I said in the post the reason was because they were leaving after 1 drink.", "thanks, can you explain why?\n\nIn my mind offering to get someone a drink is a nice thing to do, not doing a nice thing doesnt mean you have done a bad thing.\n\nAlso, get does really mean buy, I mean technically I could ask them to pay me back, or ask to do it in 2 transactions, but this is definitely not what was meant, it was mean to get and buy.", "Yeah agreed. I don\u2019t only buy people drinks if I know I\u2019m gonna get one back, there are multiple times I have bought people drinks and not had one back or whatever, fine. \n\nMy point is that I think it\u2019s very nice to buy someone a drink, I don\u2019t like that it\u2019s seen as a given. \n\nI just didn\u2019t feel like it this time\n\nNot doing something nice doesn\u2019t mean you are doing something bad.

Its just a show of generosity that is normal and sometimes expected. However complaining about it or acting like these people is embaressing and weird and no one would act like this where im from", "i THINK their view was 'we intended to buy you drinks, but you texted back too late and we didnt want to queue again' (which i agree was totally fine, not fair on them to queue again).\n\nSo to them i think it was just like 'if we were in the position to, we would have bought you a drink, but you didn't buy us one when you had the chance'\n\nI do kind of get their point, which was why I posted it here. But at the end of the day, they didn't buy me a drink, I didn't owe them a drink, and although it would have been nice for me to get them one, I dont think I was obligated, so dont think it's rude to choose not to offer.", "Nah I don\u2019t think it had anything to do with money", "I hate people who want others to be polite. I love paying for my friends and my friends tend to return the favor. But people who act like they're doing the same but don't ruffle my feathers.\n\nMy SO's ex that he had a child with, we have co-parenting meetings one a month and we USED to do it over dinner. But BM and stepdad were always having money issues on their turn to pay. \"We'll get you next time.\" The one time they paid was a really cheap breakfast place. Like $25 bucks for all 4 of us after we'd take them to places where they'd order a $16 entree each.", "When my husband and I go out with his sister and her bf the rule of thumb is if we're doing shot rounds we will alternate who's paying. Rest of the rounds we pay for our own. Like 99% of the time my hubby and her bf will go get drinks together so they can hang out and talk a bit while waiting in line lol", "Your reasoning that you want to be 'even' makes sense and is 'fair' but imo it still sucks. When I'm with my sister we buy each other meals, drinks, whatever and don't really care about being even in the end. Just do what's convenient for all and call it a day. Idc about being 'even' with family but maybe that's a privileged position where some drinks aren't gonna break my bank. You do you tho", "Its your hard earned money, there should be no culture where this should be required, and also no one in the comments has ever heard of this culture. I honestly don\u2019t think they would offer to buy you a drink from how they seem from your post.", "[deleted]", "I don't disagree with you.

NTA. This makes no sense to me. If she'd asked you to get her and her husband a drink because you were approaching the bar man, then I could understand why she's upset.

Why is it a problem that I just did x when they did x several times without chastising themselves?", "NTA\u2026 if it is basic etiquette to buy everyone a drink when at the bar, why didn\u2019t they do it then as well?  I mean, they went up to the bar to get drinks too, didn\u2019t they?  And they never came back with drinks for you guys once?", "I must not go to bars enough to understand how they work?\ud83e\udd23", "I had a Russian immigrant friend that always complained about guests not bringing a gift when visiting her. Apparently it\u2019s polite to bring food or a drink or whatever. \n\nOkay, great, my Polish grandmother taught me the same\u2026when it\u2019s a holiday or special occasion. Not every damn time.\n\nI was paycheck to paycheck and was supplementing my salary with my cc.

These people are freeloaders.", "You in the UK? \n\nI hate rounds etiquette! I no longer drink alcohol but even when I did I'd drink about 2 half pints over the course of a night. And I was always on a very low income, so hated it when rounds were assumed and I felt under an obligation to buy about 5 pints. I pretty much always opted out, but it felt rude and awkward to do so.\n\nI'm assuming you're not in quite the same situation. But even so, I agree that while it can definitely be _nice_ to offer to buy someone a drink when you go to the bar, it then becomes kinda shitty when that gets twisted into an obligation. \n\nFrankly I think they were being rude for making such a big deal of it.

Secondly not Everyone drinks alcohol and if they do not always every round. It isn\u2019t fair on them having to pay twice as much when they had a few cheap lemonades and maybe one beer.   \nIt\u2019s like going out to dinner and the ones wanting the most expensive starter, main, dessert and alcohol expect the person that only had a pizza and a coke to just split the costs between them and basically pay for the others persons stuff.
