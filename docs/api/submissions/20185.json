Our friends always said we had the perfect relationship. We often had date nights, we were healthy communicators, we mostly never fought, and our bedroom life was great. The only thing that we have every really fought about is his best friend. His best friend Lucas 27m isn\u2019t very responsible. He bounces from job to job and lives in an apartment that his mom payed for. I\u2019ve never mentioned anything because I didn\u2019t want to be rude. We usually fight because he comes home drunk late in the morning but it gets resolved quickly. At 9:30 my future mil comes in and tells me my fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t here yet. I\u2019m not very worried at this point because he usually isn\u2019t very punctual. It\u2019s a little upsetting because it\u2019s his wedding but I don\u2019t take it too hard. At around 11:30 my future mil comes in again and tells me she sent his brother and sister to look for him. At 2:00 one hour before the ceremony started my fianc\u00e9 walks in with his brother and sister. The first thing I notice is his eyes are red and he almost trips over himself. My face drops on horror as I see everyone look at him then me. I look him up and down as I see that he\u2019s wearing khaki pants and a black t-shirt with the xbox logo on it. I rip my ring of my finger and run up to him crying. I throw the ring at him and ran out. My sister and mother follow me. My mom drives us back to my house as I sob my eyes out. Me and my mom and sister sat at home all crying. The next morning someone knocked on the door and my mom answered. She told me it was my fianc\u00e9 and that he wanted to talk to me. He told me not to say anything and let him explain, I reluctantly agreed. He said that he wanted to spend his last \u201cfree\u201d night with his best friend hanging out. They have matching xbox t-shirts that they wear whenever they play. They decided to have 1v1s and drink whenever they lost. They got so drunk they passed out and didn\u2019t wake up until his brother came and dragged him to the wedding. He said he was sorry. I absolutely exploded on him and told him you were dragged to your wedding. Clearly playing xbox with your best friend is more important then fianc\u00e9. You know how important this is to me. I\u2019ve told you so many times and you decide to get drunk and show up in your stained xbox t-shirt to our wedding! I can\u2019t believe you would jeopardize our entire relationship over beers and whatever game you were playing. I never want to see you again get out of my house. This is the part where I may be the asshole here. He left with crying. My dad patted me on the back and my mom said I was a little harsh and maybe should apologize. A few hours later he texted me, \u201cit shouldn\u2019t matter what I wore it should matter that we were together on our wedding day.\u201d His mom and sister were telling me all day how rude I was to him and how I was a wicked wench who should never have been trusted.

He'll credit himself for getting there with an hour to spare but can't take responsibility for nearly no-showing his own wedding. He showed you his true colors and they are quite ugly.

It's a matter of priorities. If there's something big going on you call an early night. No one has ever missed a softball game or fishing trip with their kids because of it. Even on the 3AM nights every one of us is still up by 8 at the latest the next day, it's not hard to have fun and be a damn adult.", " Congratulations on dodging a massive bullet. He gave you a preview of exactly what your future was going to be like and you were very smart. \n\nNTA - and you were so much nicer than I would've been.", "NTA- sounds like you dodged a bullet .\n\nThe amount of people making excusing for him is appalling.\n\nDon\u2019t listen to your mom or anyone .\n\nYou deserve better than some dude who said \u201cfuck it \u201c and decided to get shit faced and pass out when he KNEW he had a important stuff happening the next morning.\n\nYou deserve a guy that wants to give you your special day and doesn\u2019t blow you off and dismiss your feelings when he RUINS YOUR WEDDING DAY.", "NTA. He got drunk and passed out the *night before his wedding?* And showed up in a *stained* *t-shirt?* If he's so irresponsible that he can't show up properly dressed to a major life event on time, that's a warning. A huge warning. A whole Tibetan Prayer Banner full of red flags flapping noisily from Mount Everest kind of warning.\n\nYou dodged a bullet. You're better off without him.", "Nta - you WEREN'T together on your wedding day. He spent most of it crashed on his buddy's couch. My guess is he now regrets it and that's why his mom and sister are blaming you.", "Yeah so it does matter what he wore to the wedding. It does matter that he was dragged from home an hr before. It does matter that he didn't care about having to be sober and look sharp.\nIt all matters cause you matter. The relationship was suppose to matter. But none of it mattered to him.  Don't take him back.", "NTA. Him saying it was has last free night says it all.", "NTA but you need to take a long, hard look in the mirror and ask yourself why you thought this was a good idea in the first place.  Choose a man without a drinking problem next time.  Don't live in denial.", "LOL, it has absolutely nothing to do with what he wore - it's that he didn't give a shit about prioritizing YOU on what should have been one of the most important and meaningful days in your lives.\n\nLet him know that this has been a wake up call, that you now know that you will always come second even on your wedding day.   This was incredibly disrespectful to you and to both of your families and friends who were there to celebrate you.

Ignore his mom & sister and you have nothing to be sorry for.  Whether you allow him back in your life is entirely up to you.  You are not an AH.  What he did was tremendously disrepectful to you and everyone else who treated the wedding as a serious event.\n\nI agree with most of the other folks that you may have dodged a bullet here.  Marriages are all about trust, and the question you need to ask yourself is whether you can trust this person in the future if he would blow off something like this.  Good luck to you OP!", "Oh my god. Imagine having children with this loser. NTA, and enjoy your freedom. You\u2019ve just lost 200 pounds of dead weight.", "NTA\n\nYou were harsh and it should have been expected by all.\n\nLet me sum up what others expressed.\n\n1. If his siblings hadn't drug him there he would not have been there for his wedding.\n2. If his siblings drug him from home he could have taken a shower and put on his suit. 30 minutes late would have been acceptable for this. The clothes he wore clearly told you he wasn't there to marry you.\n3. His behavior is bachelor party behavior. This is the reason these parties are not on the wedding night. How many movies does he need to see how getting drunk on the night before your wedding has bad consequences that usually do not end in marriage. With either the man or the woman being the drunk.\n4. This all feels like him and his buddy worked out the perfect way to stop the wedding and have you take the blame for it.", "NTA. It doesn't matter what he wore to get there. It takes less than fifteen minutes to put on a suit and look sharp. That's not the point. It's that he didn't give a shit and got blasted to the point of passing out and needing to basically be carried there. You are absolutely correct that the night before mattered much more to him than what he was supposed to be doing that day. Even with his own logic, he was hung over and barely mentally present not to mention gnat he had to be dragged in to be physically present.", "Please tell us you won\u2019t be marrying that coddled irresponsible boy.", "NTA- you are so lucky to have dodged this bullet. Imagine this man as a father if you chose to have kids. If he showed up to your wedding like this imagine how he would treat children. Sorry about forgetting to pick you up from soccer, Timmy, XBox, ya know?", "NTA \n\nHe values video games over you.  Not a good quality in a life partner.  I hope you left a mark when you threw the ring.", "NTA, his last \"free\" night was the night before you 2 started dating. At least he now has many more \"free\" nights to hang out with his boy.", "NTA. I\u2019m not fond of him saying that it was his \u201clast free night,\u201d like wtf, man. That\u2019s not the attitude you should have, and certainly not the night before the wedding.", "NTA - he didn't prioritize you AT Y'ALL'S WEDDING", "Sounds like momma's baby boy can do no wrong. Now he has more time for the things he finds more important", "Lol NTA, good call. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what I was wearing it just matters that we were there together\u201d He had to be dragged to his own wedding for God\u2019s sake! He\u2019s basically just told you that this HUGE milestone in your relationship isn\u2019t important to him at all, or at least it\u2019s less important than getting hammered and playing video games. Also, don\u2019t even get me started on the \u201clast free night\u201d thing. He definitely sounds like the kind of guy who would refer to you as \u201cthe old lady\u201d or \u201cthe old ball and chain\u201d.", "NTA. He demonstrated his immaturity and how much he prioritizes what should be the most important moment of his life up to this point. You\u2019re doing good and dodged a bullet.", "NTA. Your wedding day and that AH does this to you? Don\u2019t marry  him shows you where his priorities are and it\u2019s not you. I think he already chose his best friend over you. His maturity level is questionable.", "Nta. His behavior was so disrespectful.", "Are you going to get over this and start dating him again? YWBTA if you do.", "NTA\n\n\nI'm 36m, and I have never been married. Haven't found the right person, but if I was too, I would hold that day in the most of highest regards. I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize that as I would be very in love if I were to get married. \n\n\nPoint being. He didn't want to get married. At the least, he got cold feet and let his \"friend\" talk him out of it. \n\n\nKeep that self-respect, OP. You know what you deserve and it's definitely not this.", "NTA. He showed you what his priorities are, and you believed him. I wouldn't want to marry someone who treated the wedding like an afterthought, either.", "NTA. This jackoff chose playing a game over his wedding. You DODGED a bullet.", "NTA. If he make these in your special day and he only said acuses you are better witouth he in your Life. \nObviosly he prefer his Buddy that make the right thing for you. \nHe deserve what you said and more.", "NTA", "OP could dig a 10 ft deep trench, throw the bar in and it still wouldn\u2019t be low enough to make this guy marriage material.", "Damn. That seriously sucks, I\u2019m so sorry. NTA", "NTA - he showed you who he is. Believe him.", "NTA\n\nStay focused on the fact that he would not have been there at all if his brother had not retrieved him.

He\u2019s a child.", "NTA.   He deserves what he got.  Please don\u2019t get back together with him.   He seems to have some maturity issues, at the very least.", "I just had to read the title. NTA.
