Today I told her I was done running her errands for her and giving her rides to work because she doesn\u2019t have a valid license and also refuses to do  the paper work and fees to get that reinstated. I told her I was way too busy to be doing that stuff for her and I\u2019d only be giving t her rides to come see the children. She got mad and threatened me with a bunch of irrelevant things about CPS and spreading lies. Which she always does when she doesn\u2019t get her way. So enough was enough and I told her I\u2019m done helping her out and good luck. I called the carrier and canceled her plan. I had given her a heads up that her time on the plan was coming to an end at the end of the bill cycle which was 3 days ago and she still hadn\u2019t done.   Also I know it\u2019s not good for her to not have cell service. But she can\u2019t be unsupervised with the kids with out me or my parents being there.

You gave her plenty of warnings. \nNTA", "NTA She sounds really toxic.  You should have nothing to do with her except for those supervised visits.  For her to lose custody and only get supervised visits she must be almost a serial killer.", "NTA. But I do wonder how would you contact her if there was an emergency?", "NTA, you were being nice to help her out but you had no requirement to do so especially when she threatens you", "NTA\n\n4 months is tons of time. She can go sort her own shit out now and probably will becauee now it's inconveniencing her not you.", "NTA\n\nwhy are you preforming boyfriend duties for someone you aren\u2019t the boyfriend to?  I understand you have children but if you let her continue to use you she will and that isnt fair to you or your children", "NTA.  You might be surprised how fast she gets a new plan, she just didn\u2019t have to until now.  Same thing with the chauffeuring her around, no valid license or not, she\u2019ll will find a way, a fool no doubt, just watch!  Giving her rides to come see the children is very kind of you and she wouldn\u2019t see them if you stopped that too (hint, hint).  It\u2019s hard to stop helping someone that needs help, but there\u2019s a fine line between helping and enabling.  I\u2019m glad her visitations are supervised, she seems a bit unstable.", "If you stuck to your username you wouldn\u2019t have to deal with this at all lol. Butt yeah, NTA. She can say and threaten whatever she wants but no court will take her seriously especially being in a sober living home. Mint Mobile is dirt cheap. If she can\u2019t afford that she doesn\u2019t deserve a phone.", "NTA.", "Lol 4 months is long enough for her to get a new one... so you're NTA!!!", "NTA\n\nIt wasn't without warning, as it sounds like you did give her warning. 3 days is enough to sort out a phone plan realistically.", "NTA. She must have been exhausting.", "A huge part of addiction is manipulation. NTA for all of the reasons others have told you. I am going to tell you that cutting her off is the best thing you can do for her and the kids. The sooner people stop allowing the manipulation the sooner she will get her shit in order. And even if she never gets her shit in order, you are modeling appropriate boundaries for your kids by putting the brakes on this.", "NTA, but that's what you get for putting your dick in crazy without wrapping it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She can threaten you with false accusations but all of that comes to light.", "NTA. Once the phone was paid off she had a variety of choices for plans that are affordable. She needs to get herself together.", "NTA. You gave her warning. She knew EXACTLY when the service would end.  I would capture any documentation (texts, emails, etc.) that prove you gave her a lot of notice and her responses.  She may contact CPS so this kind of information is helpful, especially her threats.", "NTA.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be paying my ex\u2019s phone bill for 4 months, especially when she can\u2019t even have my kids without me being there so there wouldn\u2019t be an emergency situation she\u2019d need one in.", "NTA. The ex needs to stand on her own 2 feet. I had similar with my husbands ex wife. Stick to your guns.", "NTA - You have been broken up for 6 months. I would have separated EVERY account shortly after the breakup (like when you changed the locks). She's not your responsibility.", "NTA. You already have custody of 2 kids, you don't need a 3rd. Time to grow up and be responsible.", "Yeah I think she just thought I would keep paying it  until something like this happened.  She will use any body in her life until they are fed up", "I could write a movie script over the last three years with her\u2026 It would sound non-fiction with how wheels off she was.", "She stays at a sober living house and they have a dedicated phone line", "Why would OP want to? The kids live with him and her visitation is all supervised. There is no reason why she would need to be contacted for an emergency at all.", "This women sounds like she is incapable of things that are bare minimum of being a functioning adult.\n\nYou really think this is the person to call during an emergency?", "Yeah this round of threats was the straw that broke the camels back. I thought her stint in her sober\nLiving would change some things. But when she doesn\u2019t get her way, it doesn\u2019t matter who she throws under the bus. She lacks any kind of empathy.", "100% it\u2019s never her problem until it directly affects her.", "Yeah I was reaching my breaking point between being cordial and kind and wanting to show my children compassion to their mother, but she never fails to abuse my kindness or generosity.", "Oh I know she will get a new plan tomorrow. Probably today. And she will tell everyone how unexpected this was and how I ruined her life and possibly her job and yada yada yada. Nothing is her fault no matter what. And you are 100% right about her not even attempting to see our kids when I don\u2019t pick her up.", "Homestarrunner.net \u2026 it\u2019s dot commmmmm", "Yeah and this is just a piece of this story\u2026. I am drained. In so many ways.", "Yeah it\u2019s been going on for three years. I was literally being held hostage for 2 of them because of a legal issue she fabricated that she threatened to make worse by lying if she didn\u2019t get her way.  I finally settled with the DA to a much much lesser charge and I finally was able to leave.", "It really sounds like it. Hopefully this kicks her into gear that when you set boundaries, you're serious. Keep your backbone.", "nta, but you should carefully document this stuff though.\n\nIf nothing else, use google docs.  It's free, and google records all changes, so there's an external time stamp.\n\nYou're just looking for, eg, the below.  If any whining occurs to the court, you can easily address it.  Also, even if you discuss something verbally, you can send her a text / email after that says, \"per our discussion earlier today, blah blah blah\".\n\n2023 0902 -- cut off phone as per warnings\n\n2023 0818 -- reiterated warning\n\n2023 0801 -- warned X would cut phone off; reiterated date", "So don\u2019t do it anymore. It\u2019s really easy to go to Walmart, target, rite aid, anywhere, to pick up a prepaid cellphone. They even have name brands. Last I got one it was around $35. Tracfone with a year of service is $125ish. SO has done this for years.", "You probably mean fiction, the way I learned to remember it is: fiction is stranger than non", "Then definitively NTA. The social worker or whoever at the sober living house can help her figure this stuff out.", "This statement is beyond accurate. She refused to watch even one of the kids if I wasn\u2019t home by 5. I\u2019m a plumber so my schedule is not set hours. She would threaten to leave them, threaten all kinds of things. Throw my stuff in the yard. My therapy starts on Tuesday. This is the first time I\u2019m actually venting and sayin on what\u2019s really been going on.", "If she\u2019s old enough \u201cto have children\u201d then she\u2019s old enough to take care of herself.  You\u2019re not her dad.  You\u2019re not her bf.  So put you first because a better you means a better dad for them", "So what if she tells the world you stopped helping her, boo hoo.  Now here\u2019s some life advice about other people\u2019s opinions:  There\u2019s only two people in your life whose opinions matter\u2026.the person who\u2019s paying your bills and the person who\u2019s wiping your ass.  If you\u2019re lucky, both of those people are you!  Got it?  Good.", "Why pick her up?\n\nIsn't she, one way or the other, simply going to disappoint your kids their entire life? Why subject them to that kind of instability?", "One of the few who get it hahaha. Have a safe weekend bud", "Great idea. Wish I had thought of this years ago", "Lol yes. That is what I meant. My bad.", "Agreed. I can\u2019t help her try to be an adult anymore. I have to actual babies I need to take care of.", "We understand and start taking care of yourself, don\u2019t worry about x.", "Oh I\u2019m not concerned about what she says. Everyone we know what\u2019s going. I was just demonstrating the kind of immature behavior she portrays when she doesn\u2019t get her way.", "It was a mistake from the beginning. I got in deep really fast and wanted to be there through both pregnancies for a lot of reason. First one was a little bit of a surprise.  Second one was  because she wasn\u2019t taking her birth control and didn\u2019t tell me. It\u2019s a really long long story."]}
