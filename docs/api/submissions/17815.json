All of that is fine and they had previously asked if they could use our hose/water sometimes to which we said okay, no problem. Everything has been fine and everyone who used the water was polite and relatively friendly. However, a few days ago there was a crew of about 5 guys that we\u2019ve never seen before so we\u2019re assuming they\u2019re just another group of contracted workers and they asked us if they could use the water. We said okay, and asked that they pull the hose out to the side of the house so the water doesn\u2019t get all over our front door/entrance. Well, they pulled it to our lawn instead and dragged the hose through our garden, squishing some of the flowers and left the hose out there overnight. The next day we put it back and weren\u2019t able to speak to them as we were not home all day. Then we come home to find they disconnected the hose from the tap and water was all over the front entrance to our house. They didn\u2019t reconnect it before leaving . \nWe were able to talk to them this morning, but they didn\u2019t seem happy about it. They agreed, but insisted on pulling the hose to the front lawn instead of to the side of the house and I said as long as they pull it around the garden and put things back it\u2019s fine. Word for word I said, \u201cwe have no issue with you using the water, but you need to put things back where you found it\u201d. Idk if that was rude, but the main guy that talked to me didnt seem to care and seemed like he thought I was making a big deal out of nothing. But he said okay so I thought that would be the end of it. \nWell they did the same thing and dragged the hose through the garden, leaving it out there overnight. Not really a big deal, but I feel like it\u2019s more of a respect thing, especially since we technically didn\u2019t have to agree to let them use our water. They\u2019re also supposedly going to be here for about 2 more weeks. \nNow we\u2019re thinking of letting our neighbour know and seeing if we can come up with a solution as our issue is only with the few workers that have been here the past few days.
