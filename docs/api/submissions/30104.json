Both also kept their relationship a secret from me for over a year - I only found out about it from my younger sister (17F), who thought I needed to know. I felt betrayed and disgusted. Even now, months after I found out, I never went back home and refused most of their attempts to contact me. I do talk to my mother occasionally for other reasons, but those are brief conversations.\n\nI heard from my sister they are getting married; my mother tried to work this into one of our chats before I shut her down. Well, yesterday I got a huge text from my old friend and future stepdad\u2026 He first said a lot about the two of us, how my friendship always meant the world to him, how sorry he is for how they handled things in the beginning, keeping it from me and such\u2026 \n\nHe went on by saying my mother is devastated by this situation, that nothing would make her happier than having the whole family together, that his own family and everyone else has already accepted their relationship and that he hopes I can still attend their wedding and, even if I don\u2019t, that maybe one day I can be cool with it and be in their lives again.\n\nI thought about ignoring it but I ended up writing him back. I told him I\u2019m sure his mother is thrilled because now he found another woman to pick up his slack, and that I never want to be a part of this wedding and the disgusting new family they\u2019re creating.

I know reddit likes to say no-contact for nearly everything and most of the time its way too overboard, but this is the type of shit where I would genuinely go no-contact with both people and stop all communication. \n\nCompletely trust- and boundary-breaking for me right there.

I will stop short of saying she's a sexual predator who groomed him, but, it's probably at least venturing into that sort of territory here.\n\nEnd of the day, your mother and he can do whatever they want as consenting adults, but that doesn't mean that you have to accept or tolerate their relationship. It's weird, absolutely.", "Well that's one hell of a situation. NTA. Everyone here is an adult and is making their own decisions for what's best for them.

Some young dick that's going to get tired of her when she's older..... and your so-called friend lied to you as well honestly I would go no contact with both these people. If they came to you up front and said look we didn't expect this but we're starting to see one another and we hope you're okay with it then I think it would be weird and you don't have to support it but at least they were honest with you but no they lied to you for a long time... put them behind your back and that to me is the unforgivable part.", "Seems like you both said what you wanted to say.

Are they allowed to live their lives? Yes. Are you allowed to hold your ground and peace? Definitely. You donot need to go to the wedding.

Who's to say this wasn't happening when he was a teenager...yuck.", "NTA even a little bit. I haven't read the responses, but any votes otherwise are imo wrong. It's nice he's apologized for what he did wrong in the beginning. You can accept that without be part of their relationship. People don't get to treat you poorly, apologize and then have everything go according to their plan. If that's what they're expecting (which it seems they are), it's not a real apology. Apologies aren't done in order to get something. Did they ever apologize before? If so, did they apologize while asking directly or implying they want something? Not an apology to me. \n\nFrom somewhat similar experience, you do need to work on moving on for yourself. However, moving on doesn't mean being part of their relationship/new family. Find the boundaries needed to protect yourself and stick to it. For me, it was not being around the relationship period.", "NTA\n\nI don't usually care about age gaps as long as the two are consenting adults.  But this, this has my \"Sweet Home Alabama/Country Roads/Deliverance\" meter going off.  It's just strange and cringey and such.

You has the right to marry whoever she wants, so is your friend (or ex friend now). But you also doesnt have an obligation or duty to be in their lives or be okay with it. And thats completely fine.", "NTA. This whole thing is icky. I would distance myself from it too. Keep an eye on your sister she will need someone solid in her life.", "NTA.

I doubt your sister is thrilled either.", "NTA. She knew him when he was a child. That's enough of an ick no for me.\n\nOne of my online friends was 11 when I met him (I was in my 20's). I still see him as 11 forever even though he's taller than me, has a full beard and a gf.", "NTA\n\nHe's delusional if he thinks any part of this is acceptable. But your mother is the main one at fault here. She knew this boy as a minor. She knew him as her child's friend. Going from that to sleeping with him and spinning some yarn about marriage and creating a family is sickening. She is a creep. If the genders were reversed, the younger girl wouldn't be getting much blame at all.\n\nHave you actually told your mother how disgusting what she's doing is? Because she's not just dating your former friend. She almost certainly groomed him. There is absolutely an imbalance of power at play, and she is now manipulating him into applying pressure on you to get you to do what she wants. Tell her that you've noticed the manipulation, and shes not fooling you. That she is a predator who just happened to wait until there was legally nothing to be done before actively pursuing her prey. That she has set fire to your relationship with both of them.\n\nNone of that can ever be fixed. Hopefully, your former friend manages to escape her at some point, but even then, it's nothing to do with you. Hopefully, no one else falls victim to her. Female predators are a very real thing. I'm so sorry that you were raised by one. Stay far, far away from her, no matter what.", "Okay this is weird, but why are you making it about you?  If you fell in love with someone who surprised others would you want them to write you off?  Just accept that they're happy ffs and quit being a baby about it.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Your mother dated an adult, not a school-age child. Get over yourself. Just because you know him you are trying to make that count as a yuck. If you hadnt known him, would you be so rude to both of them?", "NAH.. they maybe wrong for hiding it from you. But with the age difference and bein your friend does kinda complicate things and they may have waited till they were very sure themselves. \n\nIf they haven\u2019t cheated on a partner.

Just Live & let live bro..", "NAH\n\nLook you are entitled to not like it - but what they did is hardly wrong either. Like she's your mom but she obv had you when she was barely or not really an adult yet either so she's allowed to have a life. She obv had to be a mom before she got to be an adult so would be nice if for once she could just be an individual for herself without others' expectations.", "YTA, but not for staying out of the nuptials. For the sake of your young sister, your relationship with your mother (who you clearly still speak to) and your future relationships with other family members of yours, I think you could have taken a more moderate approach in your communication with them. There\u2019s no need or benefit in calling anyone disgusting, even if that\u2019s how you feel. It won\u2019t push them apart, it just makes everyone sad and it makes everything harder for everyone. Our parents are just people, in the end they get to make their choices (within the law) and live their lives. Sitting in judgement on them, or anyone this vocally just isn\u2019t helpful, and it will eat away at you. You are entitled to your feelings (hurt, betrayal, embarrassment) but what you do about them could still be handled with a more mature approach. You can keep away, and support your sister, without the vitriol.", "NAH. I get why OP finds this creepy. A same aged friend marrying his mother is not normal. But on the other hand they are both adults and an 18 years age difference is not even so outrageous much. OP has a really young mother for his age.", "I get why you would feel so uncomfortable with this. \n\nBut I do think you should let your mum be happy.", "Eh, idk. Life is short. Live and let live and all that. \n\nYea, they handled it horribly in the beginning.

She wasn\u2019t sleeping with him while he was in HS. They reconnected when he was an adult. \n\nIt\u2019s awkward but it doesn\u2019t have to be a life sentence of unhappiness and familial separation.

Grow up you self center ahole.", "I mean NTA but you should get over it enough that you can be civil so you get to keep a relationship with your sister.\n\nIt's gross that she's with one of your childhood friends.

And it's funny that you are making OP out to be self centered since your indignation probably comes from something similar that has happened to you (so sorry about that though) and are projecting it onto OP.
