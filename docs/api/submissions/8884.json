Your husband is completely right. \n\nTrying to force a child to participate in something she already knows she doesn't like for the sake of pictures is really gross.

She accused me of being jealous of her wedding (I had a courthouse wedding) and that I was rising my daughter to be a selfish person who doesn\u2019t care about her family and welcoming new members.\n\nUh...Wow. NTA. Kudos to you, mom, for listening and supporting your child.\n\nShe was invited to be a flower girl, she has turned down the invitation. Simple as that.\n\nThey are angry because they can't force your child to do what they want. How amazingly revealing! I love it when assholes out themselves so completely, lol.\n\nThis is a great time to discuss boundaries with your daughter, what healthy ones look like and most importantly, what unhealthy ones look like and how to respond to both.\n\nIf it were me, I wouldn't let them or their future offspring near my kid. Yikes!", "NTA but I am concerned you think of your 5 year old as a toddler", "NTA. No one should force a child to do something like that. Your daughter said no. That is enough. \n\nMy husband and I asked our niece on his side to be our flower girl. She was 4 and a half. We made sure she knew what to expect and she seemed fine with it, but we were totally fine if she changed her mind on the day. It ended up being great. She was adorable and put her own spin on distributing her flowers, lol. But with kids you have to be flexible. \n\nYour daughter is not a prop. She is not obligated to do something she is uncomfortable with just because someone asked. She was a flower girl once and didn\u2019t like it. And given how your bro and SIL reacted when she said no, it seems likely that they would expect too much of her on the day, which is almost guaranteed to cause a meltdown. For example, would they expect full hair and makeup? I am an adult and I found that whole process difficult to tolerate at my wedding! I imagine it would be way too much for a lot of 5 year olds. Our niece did not have her hair and makeup done. The pictures were exhausting for both my husband and me. Our niece did well with her portion (she\u2019s a trouper!) but if she had gotten upset, we wouldn\u2019t have forced her to continue. Would your brother and sister in law given your daughter the same flexibility?\n\nGood for you for protecting your daughter. She shouldn\u2019t be forced to be anyone\u2019s prop. And she deserves better than people who only want her around for her looks.", "NTA\n\nYour child is more important than your SIL-to-be's happy wedding.    \n\n> My family is telling me to just go with it and that she won\u2019t even remember when she is older but she will blame me for breaking a bond with her future cousins\n\nIt's sounding like not having that bond would be a good thing.   \n\nThe sort of person who puts their wedding perfection as higher importance than a child's happiness shouldn't be in your child's life.\n\nToxic people don't get a place in you life just because of your relationship to them.", "NTA\nRun far and fast. Your husband is right.", "NTA- 5 yrs old is old enough to know what they want and clearly she has no interest especially given what happened before. \n\nIt\u2019s unsettling that her teacher and SIL are teaching her that her value is tied to her appearance and she\u2019s an object to improve their wedding pictures.", "Yeah nta for backing up your daughter's wishes.\n\nBut you let her be in someone's wedding just because of her looks? Is that the message you want to send?", "NTA, your daughter is a small human not a prop to fulfill SILs whims.  Tell your brother that your daughter has made her choice quite clear and since he wants to be on the subject of future children, he should start practicing how to treat children like tiny humans instead of living dolls now.  Then if they continue on with their nonsense, block them and move on.  \n\n\nTrust me, if BIL doesn't wake up and counter his bride's asshole attitudes now, you will be doing your daughter no favors by forcing a relationship with their future children later... they will just be carbon copies of the assholes you are currently dealing with.", "NTA and WTF????\n\nYour daughter is a person not a prop.  She has the right to refuse to do this and good on you to support her.  And if this is their hill to die on to tear the family apart, then this is THEIR hill and not yours. They are making the ultimatums not you.\n\nYou could also politely mention that she has already had a bad experience with this and while you could force her to participate, since she is a person and not a prop, you cannot guarantee that she will not ruin the wedding and the pictures. I mean could you imagine her smiling for their pictures in being forced to do something she doesn\u2019t want to do.\n\nBut then again, since they don\u2019t see your daughter as a autonomous human being, they would blame bad behavior on you too.\n\nYou could also compromise and get a cardboard cut out for them to use as pictures and put it on a remote controlled car or drone to \u201cwalk\u201d down the aisle.

Why do they want to force a toddler to do anything, surely they understand that's begging for a problem on the day of their wedding? Maybe point that out - do they want a flower girl who is miserable and frowning and not able to hide it at all?\n\nIf they are actually threatening that they won't let their kids meet yours, I think you should flat out let them know you think that might be for the best, because I would not want my kid hanging out with your brother or his partner if this is legit how they view the autonomy of children.", "NTA.

They have obviously never spent any time around children.\n\nI had my niece and nephew in my wedding.  The niece woke up with a fever the morning of and was a sad sack the whole day, because she was sick.  I told my SIL to just take her home, it\u2019s ok.  My SIL refused because she wanted the glam and pics.  The kid was miserable.  I felt so bad for her.  FYI, my SIL is now my ex SIL\u2026 My sister asked for my son to be in her wedding, I said, no her was too young, he was like 2.5 yrs old.  Nope not a good idea\u2026.

I suspect he is probably hoping you will cave or this will all settle down long before they have kids.  Heck, their marriage may not survive to have kids.  If he wasn\u2019t clueless, he would be talking to his wife to be about how that is not reasonable, how you guys are the parents and you get to decide\u2026 but he isn\u2019t\u2026\n\nYou are making the right decision given what happened a few months ago and that your daughter doesn\u2019t want to do it.

She is not selfish for saying \u201cno\u201d and shouldn\u2019t be pressured into doing anything if she isn\u2019t comfortable, yes even if the request comes from family. \u201cNo\u201d is a complete sentence and should be respected when it\u2019s about the individual\u2019s own boundaries for themself.", "NTA...You are raising your daughter to be someone who thinks for herself.

It's important to prioritize your daughter's well-being and comfort. If she has made it clear that she doesn't want to participate in the wedding, it's not appropriate to force her to do so. Additionally, it's not your responsibility to fulfill the demands of your brother and his fianc\u00e9.
