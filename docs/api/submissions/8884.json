She accused me of being jealous of her wedding (I had a courthouse wedding) and that I was rising my daughter to be a selfish person who doesn\u2019t care about her family and welcoming new members.\n\nUh...Wow. NTA. Kudos to you, mom, for listening and supporting your child.\n\nShe was invited to be a flower girl, she has turned down the invitation. Simple as that.\n\nThey are angry because they can't force your child to do what they want. How amazingly revealing! I love it when assholes out themselves so completely, lol.\n\nThis is a great time to discuss boundaries with your daughter, what healthy ones look like and most importantly, what unhealthy ones look like and how to respond to both.\n\nIf it were me, I wouldn't let them or their future offspring near my kid. Yikes!", "NTA but I am concerned you think of your 5 year old as a toddler", "NTA. No one should force a child to do something like that. Your daughter said no. That is enough. \n\nMy husband and I asked our niece on his side to be our flower girl. She was 4 and a half. We made sure she knew what to expect and she seemed fine with it, but we were totally fine if she changed her mind on the day. It ended up being great. She was adorable and put her own spin on distributing her flowers, lol. But with kids you have to be flexible. \n\nYour daughter is not a prop. She is not obligated to do something she is uncomfortable with just because someone asked. She was a flower girl once and didn\u2019t like it. And given how your bro and SIL reacted when she said no, it seems likely that they would expect too much of her on the day, which is almost guaranteed to cause a meltdown. For example, would they expect full hair and makeup? I am an adult and I found that whole process difficult to tolerate at my wedding! I imagine it would be way too much for a lot of 5 year olds. Our niece did not have her hair and makeup done. The pictures were exhausting for both my husband and me. Our niece did well with her portion (she\u2019s a trouper!) but if she had gotten upset, we wouldn\u2019t have forced her to continue. Would your brother and sister in law given your daughter the same flexibility?\n\nGood for you for protecting your daughter. She shouldn\u2019t be forced to be anyone\u2019s prop.

Is that the message you want to send?", "NTA, your daughter is a small human not a prop to fulfill SILs whims.  Tell your brother that your daughter has made her choice quite clear and since he wants to be on the subject of future children, he should start practicing how to treat children like tiny humans instead of living dolls now.  Then if they continue on with their nonsense, block them and move on.  \n\n\nTrust me, if BIL doesn't wake up and counter his bride's asshole attitudes now, you will be doing your daughter no favors by forcing a relationship with their future children later... they will just be carbon copies of the assholes you are currently dealing with.", "NTA and WTF????\n\nYour daughter is a person not a prop.  She has the right to refuse to do this and good on you to support her.  And if this is their hill to die on to tear the family apart, then this is THEIR hill and not yours. They are making the ultimatums not you.\n\nYou could also politely mention that she has already had a bad experience with this and while you could force her to participate, since she is a person and not a prop, you cannot guarantee that she will not ruin the wedding and the pictures. I mean could you imagine her smiling for their pictures in being forced to do something she doesn\u2019t want to do.\n\nBut then again, since they don\u2019t see your daughter as a autonomous human being, they would blame bad behavior on you too.\n\nYou could also compromise and get a cardboard cut out for them to use as pictures and put it on a remote controlled car or drone to \u201cwalk\u201d down the aisle.

They have obviously never spent any time around children.\n\nI had my niece and nephew in my wedding.  The niece woke up with a fever the morning of and was a sad sack the whole day, because she was sick.  I told my SIL to just take her home, it\u2019s ok.  My SIL refused because she wanted the glam and pics.  The kid was miserable.  I felt so bad for her.  FYI, my SIL is now my ex SIL\u2026 My sister asked for my son to be in her wedding, I said, no her was too young, he was like 2.5 yrs old.  Nope not a good idea\u2026.

I suspect he is probably hoping you will cave or this will all settle down long before they have kids.  Heck, their marriage may not survive to have kids.

Thank you for valuing your child more than selfish and superficial AHs. Was your brother always like this or did he fall under the witch's spell?", "I feel like they are advocating for low key child abuse with the \"she's so young she won't even remember it.\" So that's a justification to force your daughter to do whatever they want regardless of what she wants? Holy cow man that's sick.. you're NTA here but that woman and your brother are.", "ESH - your child\u2019s \u201cbeauty\u201d is irrelevant to this story yet you\u2019ve made it all about that.  Your brother wanted his niece in his wedding, not a \u201cgorgeous child\u201d, his niece, his family member.  You had zero qualms about putting her in what is basically a strangers wedding but now you can\u2019t put her in your own brothers\u2019 wedding.  Think of how that looks to them.  If it were me I\u2019d also be rightfully disappointed.  Now their behaviour is also quite despicable.  They should understand that you had a horrible experience before and you don\u2019t want to put your daughter through that again.  Instead of being compassionate and understanding that a five year old doesn\u2019t feel like being a wedding prop, they start threatening to never have her meet her cousins.  You all belong on Jerry Springer jeez", "I thought he meant do you really want to see how they react when daughter \u201cruins the wedding!\u201d because she doesn\u2019t do what they want", "You know what's *really* going to ruin their wedding pictures?

My daughter had a very pixie/cherub face with auburn hair as a child and several friends and family requested her as a flower girl. She loved every moment of it (especially the dress) so very happily agreed. She was in 6 different weddings from 5 to 10.", "This is the weirdest thing I've ever heard. You just grab a random child? No significance to the couple or joining families necessary? I guess I should have figured it was possible considering the amount of people that make ridiculous requests of bridesmaids. But now we have a woman threatening to blacklist a toddler for not daring to perform her family obligations?  I'm really just getting a whole new view of perverted wedding culture.", "My niece was like that as a toddler and a bit older. People would stop my brother on the street to tell him how good looking she was. It was creepy and my brother was on alert.

Not a good time for the kid, parents, or anybody else.", "I agree, but went with ESH. This post is disturbing all around and I hope the daughter has at least one safe adult in her life to protect her from these creeps.", "FINALLY YOU SAID IT! I understand why they are saying no this time but \u201cNO\u201d should also have been the answer the first time as well. The kid may be cute but should never be used as a prop.", "Right? If they force her she's going to throw a tantrum then they will accuse OP of causing it and ruining their wedding. The entitlement of some people.", "The relevance is clearly to explain why a random teacher would want her in her wedding and to explain why his brother wants her to be the flower girl. Not rocket science, you guys are just weird", "Yes.  Future SIL doesn't love her.  She just wants her as a prop.\n\nHas either she or your brother ever spent alot of time with her?

There's a huge difference between a child who just turned 3 and a child who is about to turn 4. \n\nThey're both 3, but you really can't compare the two.

I think the reason people get annoyed by it is it kind of implies a level of interest most people don't have. Kind of like showing pictures of your kids to casual acquaintances without them asking. It's like, I know there is a slight developmental difference between 1 year and 1 year and 11 months.
