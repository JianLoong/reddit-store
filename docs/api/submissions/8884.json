NTA. Kudos to you, mom, for listening and supporting your child.\n\nShe was invited to be a flower girl, she has turned down the invitation. Simple as that.\n\nThey are angry because they can't force your child to do what they want. How amazingly revealing! I love it when assholes out themselves so completely, lol.\n\nThis is a great time to discuss boundaries with your daughter, what healthy ones look like and most importantly, what unhealthy ones look like and how to respond to both.\n\nIf it were me, I wouldn't let them or their future offspring near my kid. Yikes!", "NTA but I am concerned you think of your 5 year old as a toddler", "NTA. No one should force a child to do something like that. Your daughter said no. That is enough. \n\nMy husband and I asked our niece on his side to be our flower girl. She was 4 and a half. We made sure she knew what to expect and she seemed fine with it, but we were totally fine if she changed her mind on the day. It ended up being great. She was adorable and put her own spin on distributing her flowers, lol. But with kids you have to be flexible. \n\nYour daughter is not a prop. She is not obligated to do something she is uncomfortable with just because someone asked. She was a flower girl once and didn\u2019t like it. And given how your bro and SIL reacted when she said no, it seems likely that they would expect too much of her on the day, which is almost guaranteed to cause a meltdown. For example, would they expect full hair and makeup? I am an adult and I found that whole process difficult to tolerate at my wedding! I imagine it would be way too much for a lot of 5 year olds. Our niece did not have her hair and makeup done. The pictures were exhausting for both my husband and me. Our niece did well with her portion (she\u2019s a trouper!) but if she had gotten upset, we wouldn\u2019t have forced her to continue. Would your brother and sister in law given your daughter the same flexibility?\n\nGood for you for protecting your daughter. She shouldn\u2019t be forced to be anyone\u2019s prop.

Is that the message you want to send?", "NTA, your daughter is a small human not a prop to fulfill SILs whims.  Tell your brother that your daughter has made her choice quite clear and since he wants to be on the subject of future children, he should start practicing how to treat children like tiny humans instead of living dolls now.  Then if they continue on with their nonsense, block them and move on.  \n\n\nTrust me, if BIL doesn't wake up and counter his bride's asshole attitudes now, you will be doing your daughter no favors by forcing a relationship with their future children later... they will just be carbon copies of the assholes you are currently dealing with.", "NTA and WTF????\n\nYour daughter is a person not a prop.  She has the right to refuse to do this and good on you to support her.  And if this is their hill to die on to tear the family apart, then this is THEIR hill and not yours. They are making the ultimatums not you.\n\nYou could also politely mention that she has already had a bad experience with this and while you could force her to participate, since she is a person and not a prop, you cannot guarantee that she will not ruin the wedding and the pictures. I mean could you imagine her smiling for their pictures in being forced to do something she doesn\u2019t want to do.\n\nBut then again, since they don\u2019t see your daughter as a autonomous human being, they would blame bad behavior on you too.\n\nYou could also compromise and get a cardboard cut out for them to use as pictures and put it on a remote controlled car or drone to \u201cwalk\u201d down the aisle.

They have obviously never spent any time around children.\n\nI had my niece and nephew in my wedding.

My SIL refused because she wanted the glam and pics.  The kid was miserable.  I felt so bad for her.  FYI, my SIL is now my ex SIL\u2026 My sister asked for my son to be in her wedding, I said, no her was too young, he was like 2.5 yrs old.  Nope not a good idea\u2026.

I suspect he is probably hoping you will cave or this will all settle down long before they have kids.  Heck, their marriage may not survive to have kids.

It's a huge overreaction.", "NTA, and honestly i would thank them for making sure they will never be around your daughter anymore bc they are horrible ppl.", "NTA - wow she is a hypocrite. So this AH has said you are raising your daughter to be a selfish person who doesn\u2019t care about her family. \n\nMy response would be \u201cbloody hell id better have words with your parents then because you are clearing being selfish and don\u2019t care about my daughters feelings all because you want her to be on display for you\u201d\n\nAnd they clearly don\u2019t care about her if they are so willing to threaten to cut her out of meeting her cousins etc and having nothing to do with her. It\u2019s like \u201cperform for me or else I will have nothing to do with you\u201d \n\nThey are despicable people, always put your daughter above them.", "NTA It\u2018s important for activities like this that the kids have fun and can decide whether to participate or not. It\u2018s funny that your relatives seem to feel one is a slave of the relatives\u2018 wishes. Tell them that your daughter WILL NOT participate if she doesn\u2018t want to. Kids have their ways and means to refuse to obey even if you forced her. It\u2018s all around much better for the wedding to plan differently right from the start.", "Wait I'm confused, do you mean your brother did not include any other of his nieces because they're not as pretty as your daughter?", "When speaking/writing English I would call my child a toddler as well and he is 4. I am not a native English speaker, just like OP, and its what first comes to mind. I had to Google the correct word, which is apperantly preschooler..? Would never think of using it. Where I live, it is not common to use a word that translates to preschooler either.", "English is not the OP\u2019s first language. She says that in her post.", "Thank you! My thought exactly. I'm not a native speaker as well and it was totally understandable for me. Same goes to calling her daughter beautiful. It's not just for looks, but for personality as well. There are kids who are spoiled and braty and there are kids who are well behaved, helpful, smart and kind, which makes them beautiful little People", "Because it is inaccurate. In a lot of the world preschool doesn't start until five and a half/six, as preschool is a specific form of the educational system. So calling a kid that just turned 5 a preschooler would be wrong.", "We know the child is not a toddler. We know this because the child is five years old, while the toddler stage begins when a typically developing child starts learning to walk and ends by age 3 or before.", "And we know that the way the US does everything is the only way it is done anywhere. And if someone, somewhere dares to do it differently then they're doing it in an inferior and harmful way."]}
