I (25F) am 8 weeks 3 days pregnant and have been keeping this secret from everyone except  my SIL (28)  for over a month now. I told her as soon as I found out because she\u2019s the only one who knew we were trying. Anyway I had been keeping it a secret so that I could reveal it to my parents with a cute gift on Christmas. SIL knows this plan. She informed me a couple of days ago that she is about 4 weeks pregnant (which I\u2019m super excited about don\u2019t get me wrong). She is married to my family\u2019s \u201cgolden child\u201d and they had the first grand baby of the family 3 years ago. After her little one was born my family immediately started asking when the next grand baby was coming. I had mentioned to SIL that I wanted her to wait until after Xmas to tell them since I am farther along than her and have had this moment planned for over a month. And honestly it\u2019s only a week of waiting which I think should be more than doable.\n\n Normally I wouldn\u2019t care about this kind of thing but I\u2019m kind of the black sheep of our family already and my siblings are always seen as better than me or more important. She had agreed that she would wait until after Xmas to tell my parents so that I could have a moment where my family was excited for me and wasn\u2019t comparing me to any of my siblings. \n\nWell today she texted me that she\u2019s decided to tell them tonight because they are visiting anyway. I\u2019m kind of upset about this because now when I tell my parents, that rare moment of excitement I\u2019ve been waiting for will be overshadowed by the golden child announcing first. I was going to ask her not to do this today as we had an agreement but now I\u2019m unsure. \n\nIdk I feel like I\u2019m overreacting but this genuinely hurts my feelings as she knows how excited I was to announce this pregnancy that my parents have been waiting 3 years for.", "created_utc": 1671397429, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zp8cpo/aita_for_asking_my_sil_not_to_announce_her/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You each get to announce your pregnancy whenever you want.  Your parents are visiting her and she probably figured that they\u2019d figure out that she\u2019s pregnant.

If your SIL  announcing her pregnancy means you won't get the approval and attention you crave than their is a big problem with your family. Stop accepting the role of black sheep in your family. You deserve  better. NAH", "So far, NAH.\n\nYour feelings are your feelings and it can't hurt to ask, as long as you do so kindly and respectfully. But you also can't set unrealistic expectations or demands.\n\nQuickly make it clear to her that it wasn't just about being 'on christmas' it was that you wanted to go first (to avoid being overshadowed, at least for a week), and politely ask her to still delay. But if she says no, she says no, and she has a right to say no if she wants to.\n\nSometimes life just doesn't let our dominos fall just the way we were setting them up for and that sucks and is nobody's fault.", "NAH. At some point, you're going to have to accept that the problem isn't you. It's your toxic family. Nurturing families don't make their children feel like they have to compete for attention.", "NAH. People get to announce their pregnancy when they feel comfortable. We told family at 4 weeks but waited to do the public announcement at 12. \n\nAnd honestly I think you announcing after them will be more likely to eclipse theirs than you announcing before them. Plus your baby is due first.", "NAH. Even if she announces to them today it\u2019s not the same day as you\u2019re planning to announce to them. I would hop they\u2019d still be excited for you and for her. You\u2019re definitely not wrong for feeling the way you do, but you can\u2019t really dictate what she does or doesn\u2019t do. You\u2019re also hormonal on top of all this, so that\u2019s not really helping you either. She\u2019s not wrong for wanting to to tell them now either, especially if your brother is also wanting to tell them. Congratulations on the baby!!", "INFO: does she know about your motivation to want to go first? Is she aware that she is married to the Golden Child?", "NTA. Smile and bite your tongue. Your SIL is, imho, having an error in judgement in sharing news of her pregnancy at 4 weeks.", "But when CAN she tell them? If it\u2019s too soon AFTER your announcement she\u2019ll be stealing the spotlight too\u2026 I think your parents treating your brother as \u201cthe golden child\u201d and you as \u201cthe black sheep\u201d has you overthinking this and being too controlling of your SIL. I think you\u2019re trying really hard to win the approval of people who always treat you as less than, thinking you announcing first is going to make them finally treat you better\u2026 and you\u2019re likely to end up disappointed no matter how this unfolds.", "im gonna go against the grain here so far and say NTA. you two had an agreement, now she's going back on her word. waiting a week really isn't going to hurt her especially since she knows you've had this announcement planned for a long time. i'd say it wouldn't hurt to at least have an honest discussion with her about this.", "NTA. She's being selfish. SIL knows what this means to you, she already had her moment in the sun (for a long time I bet), and now she wants your moment too.", "NAH.  I think SIL veers towards AH territory as she shouldn't have told you she'd wait until after x-mas if she didn't mean it.  Still, it's up to the both of you individually when & how you want to reveal your pregnancies.  So while it sucks that she announces first, that's ultimately up to her, just like it's up to you to wait until x-mas to announce yours.", "NTA! I know everyone will say Y T A but seriously?? She can\u2019t wait a week? She\u2019s already had this moment! It\u2019s not even her parents! Might not technically be wrong of her to do, but it does feel unnecessarily selfish. It\u2019s not like you asked her to wait to get pregnant.", "NAH\n\nYour parents should still be excited for you. She is telling them a different day,  not the same day.\nYou asked, this works for her,.\nYou can be sad, but until you tell them your assuming they won\u2019t be as happy for you.", "NAH - but i do think youre overreacting. Your parents wont be any less excited for you when you tell them.", "I think it\u2019s fair to ask again as you have been planning for so long and have communicated these plans with her ahead of time. \n\nAlso has someone who has worked in maternal fetal medicine I always cringe when people tell families about a pregnancy 4 weeks in that\u2019s really early and anything can happen. Generally I\u2019d recommend waiting a little long (in my opinion 20 weeks for the anatomy scan) but that\u2019s just my opinion. At 8 weeks you\u2019re still early but have potentially done prenatal testing to get some reassurance that the pregnancy is healthy and viable.", "No one is the asshole here, seems a reasonable request but it\u2019s also a reasonable thing to say no to, you tried but she\u2019s excited and you can\u2019t stop her from telling her family", "NAH. You are allowed to feel upset, but she is allowed to share her news too.", "NTA\u2026 but given that she knows the reasoning and importance of waiting a week and she\u2019s only 4 weeks pregnant (a risky time to share given the number of early miscarriages that happen annually). If she feels she can tell them whenever she wishes and that it\u2019s fine if she goes back on her word, you can return this favor and simply tell your parents sooner so that her news is second. By her own logic, there should be no issue here. \ud83d\udc40\n\nEither that, or just wait til Christmas, execute the reveal as planned, and be happy there\u2019s a week in between her careless reveal and your thoughtful one. You could even sweeten the pot and casually mention how you\u2019re further along and how the SIL knew first\u2026 let them decide how awful that was of her. \ud83d\ude1c", "NTA. You are entitled to feel upset and tbh I feel like she is doing it deliberately. Never been pregnant but always thought it was bad practice to tell before 12 weeks but that is not fact and my opinion. Just let her do it and go ahead with your announcement as you planned. Try not to think about it and try to be okay with it. Even if she is, don\u2019t let her steal your joy and by getting upset about it, you are letting her do just that, intentional or otherwise. Enjoy your pregnancy and your announcement and don\u2019t worry about what others do or say.", "If she waited and told after you, you'd probably get annoyed that she's taking away the spotlight from you. If you don't say anything, NAH because you don't get to decide when someone announces a pregnancy but its ok to be annoyed about it. Feelings aren't bad but acting badly because of them is, so YWBTA if you did something about this other than talk to your SO about your feelings on the subject.", "NAH, but I think you are strongly mistaken if you think announcing your pregnancy first will change your black sheep status. As the person who is married to the black sheep, as soon as you accept that and realize nothing you do will change that. After years of hurt, my husband finally realized that nothing he will ever do will ever be good enough he went to therapy to learn how to cope.My in laws have seen my 8 year old maybe ten times and my three year old once even though they live 30 minutes away, but our door is always open. There is so much hurt and words that shouldn\u2019t have been said from both sides, but sometimes things are just meant to be broken. I wish you all the best in your pregnancy.", "NTA. I definitely would do this for my SIL and she\u2019d do the same. They\u2019ve already had their moment. I\u2019m sorry and hope you get the excited reaction you\u2019re looking for and deserve.", "Mildly YTA. It\u2019s not up to you when she announces her pregnancy, you also could have already told your family but decided to wait.\nYour family don\u2019t sound great by the way if siblings are favoured, sorry about that.

This will not change you \"status\" either way just give you a few moments of attention if your sister does comply.", "YTA You don't get to control when other people share their news. I'm sorry it worked out like this for you, but you could have announced earlier and she has a life too.", "Yta.  You have chosen to wait to announce your pregnancy.

Be thankful she'll be announcing it sooner.", "I get where you're coming from, but YTA. \n\nYou don't get to dictate when your SIL announces her pregnancy. The feelings of hurt you have should really be something you're addressing with your parents. You're preparing for them to be more excited about your brother having another kid then you having a kid, which isn't you, your brother's, or your SILs fault. There is more than enough love and excitement to go around and if your parents don't share in that, well, that's on them.", "YTA I know it sucks being a black sheep and no having the spotlight stolen/shared but it\u2019s not her fault and you can\u2019t control how she handles her pregnancy. It was unfair of you to ask her to wait in the first place.", "Sorry but YTA. You will still be able to deliver your surprise and gift as intended, regardless of SIL's own pregnancy. Everyone is entitled to their own news and lives. While it's unfortunate that SIL's news seems likely to overshadow your pregnancy in the eyes of your loved ones, that is a problem with your family and not a her problem. Classic \"missing stair\" issue.\n\nYou had the chance to deliver the news earlier and enjoy a monopoly on the subject, but that time is past now, which is just a natural risk you run when you wait. You've been planning to sit on this information for two months, and you do not have a right to put other people's information on hold because of your personal timeline.\n\nIt would be more of an N A H if you just asked with no pressure and she was perfectly fine with doing you a favor and waiting, but don't force the issue now that she's not willing anymore.", "YTA she can announce her pregnancy whenever she fucking wants unless it\u2019s at your baby shower or wedding. Get over yourself.", "What is up with people thinking joy and celebrations are finite? More than one pregnancy can be celebrated at a time. Also, Christmas is still a week away.

It's your first so im sure they'll be just as excited.", "NTA, she agreed to wait then crawfished. It is a week. She is being petty. On a side not your family sounds horrible.", "ESH.\n\nI do think it's shady of her to say she was cool waiting and then go \"Actually, I changed my mind!\" \n\nBut you don't get to say when other people share their exciting news.", "Nta if it was discussed previously what you would do her going against that speaks moreso to her lack of character", "NTA, but your parents are for making you feel like you need to prove you are worthy of their love.
