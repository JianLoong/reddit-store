I (25F) am 8 weeks 3 days pregnant and have been keeping this secret from everyone except  my SIL (28)  for over a month now. I told her as soon as I found out because she\u2019s the only one who knew we were trying. Anyway I had been keeping it a secret so that I could reveal it to my parents with a cute gift on Christmas. SIL knows this plan. She informed me a couple of days ago that she is about 4 weeks pregnant (which I\u2019m super excited about don\u2019t get me wrong). She is married to my family\u2019s \u201cgolden child\u201d and they had the first grand baby of the family 3 years ago. After her little one was born my family immediately started asking when the next grand baby was coming. I had mentioned to SIL that I wanted her to wait until after Xmas to tell them since I am farther along than her and have had this moment planned for over a month. And honestly it\u2019s only a week of waiting which I think should be more than doable.\n\n Normally I wouldn\u2019t care about this kind of thing but I\u2019m kind of the black sheep of our family already and my siblings are always seen as better than me or more important. She had agreed that she would wait until after Xmas to tell my parents so that I could have a moment where my family was excited for me and wasn\u2019t comparing me to any of my siblings. \n\nWell today she texted me that she\u2019s decided to tell them tonight because they are visiting anyway. I\u2019m kind of upset about this because now when I tell my parents, that rare moment of excitement I\u2019ve been waiting for will be overshadowed by the golden child announcing first. I was going to ask her not to do this today as we had an agreement but now I\u2019m unsure. \n\nIdk I feel like I\u2019m overreacting but this genuinely hurts my feelings as she knows how excited I was to announce this pregnancy that my parents have been waiting 3 years for.\n\nETA: I did NOT try to stop her from telling my parents tonight, that\u2019s not my choice, I knew that even when I posted this. I\u2019m excited for her and I love her and I would never try to dim her joy despite what a few of you have implied about me \ud83e\udd70 I just wanted to know if i was the AH for asking her to wait. Never seen so many mixed answers in this sub! \n\nETA: if you\u2019re just going to suggest therapy, don\u2019t.

You deserve  better. NAH", "So far, NAH.\n\nYour feelings are your feelings and it can't hurt to ask, as long as you do so kindly and respectfully. But you also can't set unrealistic expectations or demands.\n\nQuickly make it clear to her that it wasn't just about being 'on christmas' it was that you wanted to go first (to avoid being overshadowed, at least for a week), and politely ask her to still delay. But if she says no, she says no, and she has a right to say no if she wants to.\n\nSometimes life just doesn't let our dominos fall just the way we were setting them up for and that sucks and is nobody's fault.", "NAH. At some point, you're going to have to accept that the problem isn't you. It's your toxic family. Nurturing families don't make their children feel like they have to compete for attention.", "NAH. People get to announce their pregnancy when they feel comfortable. We told family at 4 weeks but waited to do the public announcement at 12. \n\nAnd honestly I think you announcing after them will be more likely to eclipse theirs than you announcing before them. Plus your baby is due first.", "NAH. Even if she announces to them today it\u2019s not the same day as you\u2019re planning to announce to them. I would hop they\u2019d still be excited for you and for her. You\u2019re definitely not wrong for feeling the way you do, but you can\u2019t really dictate what she does or doesn\u2019t do. You\u2019re also hormonal on top of all this, so that\u2019s not really helping you either. She\u2019s not wrong for wanting to to tell them now either, especially if your brother is also wanting to tell them. Congratulations on the baby!!", "INFO: does she know about your motivation to want to go first? Is she aware that she is married to the Golden Child?", "NTA. Smile and bite your tongue. Your SIL is, imho, having an error in judgement in sharing news of her pregnancy at 4 weeks.", "But when CAN she tell them? If it\u2019s too soon AFTER your announcement she\u2019ll be stealing the spotlight too\u2026 I think your parents treating your brother as \u201cthe golden child\u201d and you as \u201cthe black sheep\u201d has you overthinking this and being too controlling of your SIL. I think you\u2019re trying really hard to win the approval of people who always treat you as less than, thinking you announcing first is going to make them finally treat you better\u2026 and you\u2019re likely to end up disappointed no matter how this unfolds.", "im gonna go against the grain here so far and say NTA. you two had an agreement, now she's going back on her word. waiting a week really isn't going to hurt her especially since she knows you've had this announcement planned for a long time. i'd say it wouldn't hurt to at least have an honest discussion with her about this.", "NTA. She's being selfish. SIL knows what this means to you, she already had her moment in the sun (for a long time I bet), and now she wants your moment too.", "NAH.  I think SIL veers towards AH territory as she shouldn't have told you she'd wait until after x-mas if she didn't mean it.  Still, it's up to the both of you individually when & how you want to reveal your pregnancies.  So while it sucks that she announces first, that's ultimately up to her, just like it's up to you to wait until x-mas to announce yours.", "NTA! I know everyone will say Y T A but seriously?? She can\u2019t wait a week? She\u2019s already had this moment! It\u2019s not even her parents! Might not technically be wrong of her to do, but it does feel unnecessarily selfish. It\u2019s not like you asked her to wait to get pregnant.", "NAH\n\nYour parents should still be excited for you. She is telling them a different day,  not the same day.\nYou asked, this works for her,.\nYou can be sad, but until you tell them your assuming they won\u2019t be as happy for you.", "NAH - but i do think youre overreacting. Your parents wont be any less excited for you when you tell them.", "I think it\u2019s fair to ask again as you have been planning for so long and have communicated these plans with her ahead of time. \n\nAlso has someone who has worked in maternal fetal medicine I always cringe when people tell families about a pregnancy 4 weeks in that\u2019s really early and anything can happen. Generally I\u2019d recommend waiting a little long (in my opinion 20 weeks for the anatomy scan) but that\u2019s just my opinion. At 8 weeks you\u2019re still early but have potentially done prenatal testing to get some reassurance that the pregnancy is healthy and viable.\n\nEdit: you can tell anyone you want about your pregnancy whenever you like. I don\u2019t know that I worded this well, but my point is more that a lot of people don\u2019t consider the possibility of a miscarriage and will share with a lot of people who they may NOT want to be involved if there is a miscarriage or in a much worse scenario is they choose to terminate for a medical problem because there is A LOT of stigma around that. For me I would be comfortable telling my own mother early on but I would wait to tell my in-laws. That could be different for OPs SIL, but I\u2019ve come across a lot of people in my line of work who get bad news and then are worried  about explaining what happened to people (yes including some family) which can (but not always) add another layer of stress. I just don\u2019t know why there\u2019s such a rush a to break the news and then run the risk of that news spreading to others because your close loved ones are excited. Also, If you don\u2019t share and then miscarry, you can still reach out to any you like for support and I would encourage that. Just because you didn\u2019t tell someone the moment you conceived doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t ever tell them what happened in the event of a miscarriage.", "No one is the asshole here, seems a reasonable request but it\u2019s also a reasonable thing to say no to, you tried but she\u2019s excited and you can\u2019t stop her from telling her family", "NAH. You are allowed to feel upset, but she is allowed to share her news too.", "NTA\u2026 but given that she knows the reasoning and importance of waiting a week and she\u2019s only 4 weeks pregnant (a risky time to share given the number of early miscarriages that happen annually). If she feels she can tell them whenever she wishes and that it\u2019s fine if she goes back on her word, you can return this favor and simply tell your parents sooner so that her news is second. By her own logic, there should be no issue here. \ud83d\udc40\n\nEither that, or just wait til Christmas, execute the reveal as planned, and be happy there\u2019s a week in between her careless reveal and your thoughtful one. You could even sweeten the pot and casually mention how you\u2019re further along and how the SIL knew first\u2026 let them decide how awful that was of her. \ud83d\ude1c", "NTA. You are entitled to feel upset and tbh I feel like she is doing it deliberately. Never been pregnant but always thought it was bad practice to tell before 12 weeks but that is not fact and my opinion. Just let her do it and go ahead with your announcement as you planned. Try not to think about it and try to be okay with it. Even if she is, don\u2019t let her steal your joy and by getting upset about it, you are letting her do just that, intentional or otherwise. Enjoy your pregnancy and your announcement and don\u2019t worry about what others do or say.", "If she waited and told after you, you'd probably get annoyed that she's taking away the spotlight from you. If you don't say anything, NAH because you don't get to decide when someone announces a pregnancy but its ok to be annoyed about it. Feelings aren't bad but acting badly because of them is, so YWBTA if you did something about this other than talk to your SO about your feelings on the subject.", "NAH, but I think you are strongly mistaken if you think announcing your pregnancy first will change your black sheep status. As the person who is married to the black sheep, as soon as you accept that and realize nothing you do will change that. After years of hurt, my husband finally realized that nothing he will ever do will ever be good enough he went to therapy to learn how to cope.My in laws have seen my 8 year old maybe ten times and my three year old once even though they live 30 minutes away, but our door is always open. There is so much hurt and words that shouldn\u2019t have been said from both sides, but sometimes things are just meant to be broken. I wish you all the best in your pregnancy.", "NTA. I definitely would do this for my SIL and she\u2019d do the same. They\u2019ve already had their moment.

I'm sorry it worked out like this for you, but you could have announced earlier and she has a life too.", "Yta.  You have chosen to wait to announce your pregnancy.

Think of it this way, you're announcing it on christmas, what could be more special than that? Be thankful she'll be announcing it sooner.", "I get where you're coming from, but YTA. \n\nYou don't get to dictate when your SIL announces her pregnancy. The feelings of hurt you have should really be something you're addressing with your parents. You're preparing for them to be more excited about your brother having another kid then you having a kid, which isn't you, your brother's, or your SILs fault. There is more than enough love and excitement to go around and if your parents don't share in that, well, that's on them.", "YTA I know it sucks being a black sheep and no having the spotlight stolen/shared but it\u2019s not her fault and you can\u2019t control how she handles her pregnancy.

I think this is an NTA situation", ">I would have extended her the benefit of the doubt had she not already agreed. She is choosing this because it's \"simpler\" with full knowledge this is upsetting to OP.\n\nMy assumption is that she somehow got the impression that 'on christmas' was the issue. That OP just didn't want to both announce on the same day. It's possible \"oh I'll just do it early then and then everything will die down and then she can have her moment\" is SIL's train of thought.\n\nI can see that as being ignorantly uncaring at best. So, still in 'benefit of the doubt' range.\n\nAfter all, SIL reached out about it and volunteered the information that she was going to do this ahead of time. It gives OP a chance to respond, *if* OP has an issue with this solution/compromise. SIL could have just gone and done it fait accompli.\n\nIf the OP didn't make it clear that she wanted to be first, then there was some possible miscommunication. So that's why my advice was to clear up that potential miscommunication.\n\n>Is it unreasonable for someone to ask for a small favor, knowing that it means so much to them and so little to you?\n\nIt is not unreasonable to ask. It *is* unreasonable to expect or demand. This is where the line so often falls on these AITA questions.\n\n>choosing to renege on her agreement\n\nAgain, perception. My benefit of the doubt is saying she simply saw a convenient compromise opportunity and is taking that instead. \"Because they are visiting anyway.\" A change in circumstances often necessitates a change in the agreement. That's not unusual.\n\nAgain, it all hinges on her reaction after the reiteration I suggested, assuming that was done in time, assuming that's what OP chooses to do. If not then it still kind of hinges on her personality and attitude and such. I don't think miscommunication makes people AH, and I still see a potential that miscommunication is what might have happened here.\n\n>She knows this will upset OP and is doing it anyways\n\nIf that's correct, then you're right. I just don't think there's enough evidence to prove that this is how SIL is thinking and feeling about the situation. That's mindreading territory. I don't mindread. It's possible she could be feeling this, but so far there's no data to prove it.\n\nIt's possible that she thinks this compromise will *appease* the OP which is why she offered it. I see that as at least a *possible* explanation of her actions until more data proves one way or the other. So, benefit of the doubt.\n\n\\~\n\nHowever, as a hypothetical, say SIL never agreed at all; I don't think she'd be wrong to do so. It's her life, her pregnancy, she announces it, the end. If that had been the case, I wouldn't call SIL an AH. Apathetic and uncaring, when you are under no obligation to be caring, is not an AH. It's a default state we all live in. Only if there was malicious intent would that act rate AH level.\n\nOr, to put it another way, being kind to others is a default state too, when it's not at cost to yourself. There's a level of common decency you can expect from others...and no more. Expecting them to do more than that, such as, say, delaying the announcement of their own pregnancy, delaying the knowledge of existence of someone's grandchild, and so on, needs a little bit bigger reason than \"because it'd make me feel better.\" The bigger the cost, the bigger the reason necessary for it to balance out and meet the 'common decency' level.\n\nOr to spin the parlance again: So she's asking for 'a favor'? But what is she offering SIL *in return for* that favor? What does SIL get out of it? Because it reads as \"just please do this for me\" and not even a hint of actually *returning* that favor at all, in any means, manner, shape or form. That makes it even more honorable for someone to just say no to a request for a 'favor' like that. There's no balance there.\n\nIn my subjective opinion, announcing a pregnancy shouldn't really be anyone's business but the person's announcing it. Making it your business because you're going to feel some kind of way about the effects afterwards is already a bit of a stretch...but I'm allowing OP this because their feelings are valid and they were polite when they asked. It never hurts to *ask*. You just have to accept that 'no' is a possible answer. Otherwise you aren't exactly asking.\n\nNext hypothetical: If SIL is truly 'reneging' on her agreement, she would be an AH for breaking a promise moreso than she'd be an AH for causing all the overshadowing and whatnot, because of the previous point.", "People tend to use the term friend so loosely that I take it with a grain of salt.

And with your SIL being married to the GC this was going to happen.  So what to do.  There are always choices and options.  So first you know doing nothing and proceeding means that they will still treat you as the secondary consideration.  That sucks, and what is worse,  is that when your parents find out about you being pregnant, it will still be a secondary consideration in their eyes.\n\nSo you do have another option and this one requires that you just give up and do nothing.  You are already the black sheep of the family, so why not give them what they really want, and just fade out.  Focus that energy on your husband.  If you and he are close to his parents, make a trip out to see them, swear them to secrecy and that they would be the first who get to visit with their grandchild in exchange.  Skip out on your family where you are not there.\n\nThen sit back and watch.  See how long it takes for your parents to figure out you are not there, bet it won't be until your child is at least a year or older.  Far less stressful and far more rewarding when you do not focus on them at all.  \n\nUnless they be paying your bills, pay them no mind.", "I'm sorry, OP. I don't think anything is wrong for asking. But I would be very wary of your parents. People who don't love their children equally and treat them equally will most times do the same with the grandchildren. Golden children have golden grandchildren. If your parents aren't just as excited and treat the grandkids equally, then that's when you cut back on contact. And if they ask be honest. Your kids will pick up on their cousins being treated better. And if you don't protect them from that, then it's you who pays the price. Don't be afraid to protect your kids. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. As someone who also tried for over two years before finally conceiving I definitely understand wanting to announce to your parents in a fun way.

I bet that will knock their socks off.", "Honestly, I'm gonna say NAH because SIL does have a right to announce whenever. Her motivations for doing so may either make her T A or N T A, but it's impossible to know from this.\n\nIf I were you, you know she's going to announce. You know your family well enough that means yours is going to be an after thought. That does suck. You do have options, however. You can continue with xmas plans, or you can put some space between hers and yours. A lot of people wait until the 12 week mark, anyway, and it'd give you some time to process your own feelings.\n\nYou also have zero obligation to do a personal announcement if you think it's going to lead to negative feelings. You can do a mass social media announcement and send a follow up.", "NTA because 1) she previously agreed to the plan and 2) it seems like it should be first pregnant, first to announce.

Going back on that is an a-hole move. \n\nThe real horror of this situation though, to me, is that OP wants her family's love and approval so badly. But how I see this playing out is that these two women will go through their pregnancies together, yet somehow the baby shower will be a little better for SIL, the baby gifts will be just a little nicer, the SIL will be a little more supported, and it will drive home the idea that she will never measure up to the Golden Child brother. I hope that doesn't happen, or that OP can distance herself from her family if this begins to happen, and save herself the heartache. \n\nEither way, good luck to both these women \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA, I'm sorry for this shitty family dynamics.

U have no right or expectation to determine when someone can tell anyone anything\u2026.get over yourself.", "NTA.\n\nPeople are right--SIL can announce whenever she wants. But OP has asked that she not do so now, at Christmas, so SHE can announce. This was something SIL agreed to, and especially since SIL is so early in the pregnancy and already has one child, going back on this agreement and not waiting even a day or two after OP makes SIL an AH. \n\nLiterally what harm comes to SIL to wait a day, two, or a bit more? NONE, but it sounds like OP will be shunted aside for the golden child and his wife.\n\nI'm totally baffled by all the Y t AHs...", "Well, now you know your sister-in-law is no friend to you,  She competes against you within your own family. \n\nConsider not announcing your pregnancy now.

SIL has every right to share her happy news. It should never be that one person's happiness steals the possibility of your happiness. You're grown now, you have your own family. Time to start making yourself the number one priority, and stop trying to bend over backwards for your family to like you.\n\nNTA Go find your found family.", "NTA.

Part of me wonders if SIL knows about the dynamic you are facing.

I would try to work over time on not basing your self worth and approval on their reactions. They should not be treating you like a \"black sheep\" and even if getting to announce your pregnancy will give you a small moment of glory it seems things will just go back to how they were after some time.

And I feel like it would really bring the family together.", "NTA, but so is your SIL. Could it be that you are thinking too much of this? There's nothing in the post that indicates that your parents think or treat you as the blacksheep. Even if she tells them now, you still can surprise them during Christmas.\n\nIf my own experience is different when your DIL is pregnant vs your own daughter.

You get a week or two of attention, maybe a month, and then golden child's second kid overrides it upon announcement?\n\nThis is where you need to realize that you have a new family unit.

Quit trying to please people who don't give a shit and do you", "ESH -Im going with this because you're directing anger towards your SIL for announcing a pregnancy which is entirely her right to do so. I'll say she is also somewhat the AH because per your story she agreed not to tell them and now had changed her mind, which puts you in an awkward situation now. But most importantly, your parents are the AH if they have done things over the years to make you feel more or less valid than any siblings. \n\n I get being upset that she has decided to tell the family after she initially said she wouldn't, but to make a big deal of it and argue with her about it is going to far. You aren't really mad at her, you're mad about how your parents treat you differently, and that is something you need to take up with them, not others.

My wife and I were supported by close friends and family after both our losses, it was the \u201cperipheral people\u201d in our lives that\u2019s caused the most hurt - the ones that heard the pregnancy announcement but didn\u2019t hear about the loss.", "They\u2019re not going to care, and they\u2019ll likely see this as her trying to purposefully \u201csteal the moment\u201d. I don\u2019t see this ending well for op whatever she chooses.", "Actually, the heart doesn\u2019t develop until 17 to 20 weeks. What people hear at 6 weeks is just a cardiac signal, or \u201ca tube that generates sporadic electrical impulses that eventually coordinate into rhythmic pulses\u201d \n\nSource: https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/heartbeat-bills-called-fetal-heartbeat-six-weeks-pregnancy-rcna24435", "Pregnancy in the first few weeks go through a lot of changes. It's not really up to anyone else to decide when someone should announce. A person that is 8 weeks might have had a missed miscarriage, doesn't make it any less than. Pregnant is pregnant.", "Most people don\u2019t know how to support someone through grief.  Really close family and friends are great but awkward uncle Bob isn\u2019t the guy you want to have to explain the situation too when he asks your devastated wife how it is going.", "Ok, and some people do. So?", "You don\u2019t know what most people do.", "Fair I meant the fetal pole some people call that the heart beat.  It really isn\u2019 to your point.  I\u2019m not trying to align a political agenda here the intent was to say it is that early.  After being through it with my wife a DNC is a medical procedure and no one should get between a woman and her doctor.", "Sure but why tell awkward uncle Bob at all then? I sure don't tell people like that about my trauma. Just say not great, going through some sh*t and leave it at that"]}
