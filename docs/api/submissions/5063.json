I (25F) am 8 weeks 3 days pregnant and have been keeping this secret from everyone except  my SIL (28)  for over a month now. I told her as soon as I found out because she\u2019s the only one who knew we were trying. Anyway I had been keeping it a secret so that I could reveal it to my parents with a cute gift on Christmas. SIL knows this plan. She informed me a couple of days ago that she is about 4 weeks pregnant (which I\u2019m super excited about don\u2019t get me wrong). She is married to my family\u2019s \u201cgolden child\u201d and they had the first grand baby of the family 3 years ago. After her little one was born my family immediately started asking when the next grand baby was coming. I had mentioned to SIL that I wanted her to wait until after Xmas to tell them since I am farther along than her and have had this moment planned for over a month. And honestly it\u2019s only a week of waiting which I think should be more than doable.\n\n Normally I wouldn\u2019t care about this kind of thing but I\u2019m kind of the black sheep of our family already and my siblings are always seen as better than me or more important. She had agreed that she would wait until after Xmas to tell my parents so that I could have a moment where my family was excited for me and wasn\u2019t comparing me to any of my siblings. \n\nWell today she texted me that she\u2019s decided to tell them tonight because they are visiting anyway. I\u2019m kind of upset about this because now when I tell my parents, that rare moment of excitement I\u2019ve been waiting for will be overshadowed by the golden child announcing first. I was going to ask her not to do this today as we had an agreement but now I\u2019m unsure. \n\nIdk I feel like I\u2019m overreacting but this genuinely hurts my feelings as she knows how excited I was to announce this pregnancy that my parents have been waiting 3 years for.", "created_utc": 1671397429, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zp8cpo/aita_for_asking_my_sil_not_to_announce_her/", "score": 261, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would hop they\u2019d still be excited for you and for her. You\u2019re definitely not wrong for feeling the way you do, but you can\u2019t really dictate what she does or doesn\u2019t do. You\u2019re also hormonal on top of all this, so that\u2019s not really helping you either. She\u2019s not wrong for wanting to to tell them now either, especially if your brother is also wanting to tell them.

She's being selfish. SIL knows what this means to you, she already had her moment in the sun (for a long time I bet), and now she wants your moment too.", "NAH.  I think SIL veers towards AH territory as she shouldn't have told you she'd wait until after x-mas if she didn't mean it.  Still, it's up to the both of you individually when & how you want to reveal your pregnancies.

Your parents wont be any less excited for you when you tell them.", "I think it\u2019s fair to ask again as you have been planning for so long and have communicated these plans with her ahead of time. \n\nAlso has someone who has worked in maternal fetal medicine I always cringe when people tell families about a pregnancy 4 weeks in that\u2019s really early and anything can happen. Generally I\u2019d recommend waiting a little long (in my opinion 20 weeks for the anatomy scan) but that\u2019s just my opinion. At 8 weeks you\u2019re still early but have potentially done prenatal testing to get some reassurance that the pregnancy is healthy and viable.", "No one is the asshole here, seems a reasonable request but it\u2019s also a reasonable thing to say no to, you tried but she\u2019s excited and you can\u2019t stop her from telling her family", "NAH.

By her own logic, there should be no issue here. \ud83d\udc40\n\nEither that, or just wait til Christmas, execute the reveal as planned, and be happy there\u2019s a week in between her careless reveal and your thoughtful one.

You are entitled to feel upset and tbh I feel like she is doing it deliberately. Never been pregnant but always thought it was bad practice to tell before 12 weeks but that is not fact and my opinion. Just let her do it and go ahead with your announcement as you planned. Try not to think about it and try to be okay with it. Even if she is, don\u2019t let her steal your joy and by getting upset about it, you are letting her do just that, intentional or otherwise. Enjoy your pregnancy and your announcement and don\u2019t worry about what others do or say.", "If she waited and told after you, you'd probably get annoyed that she's taking away the spotlight from you. If you don't say anything, NAH because you don't get to decide when someone announces a pregnancy but its ok to be annoyed about it.

I think this is an NTA situation", ">I would have extended her the benefit of the doubt had she not already agreed. She is choosing this because it's \"simpler\" with full knowledge this is upsetting to OP.\n\nMy assumption is that she somehow got the impression that 'on christmas' was the issue. That OP just didn't want to both announce on the same day. It's possible \"oh I'll just do it early then and then everything will die down and then she can have her moment\" is SIL's train of thought.\n\nI can see that as being ignorantly uncaring at best. So, still in 'benefit of the doubt' range.\n\nAfter all, SIL reached out about it and volunteered the information that she was going to do this ahead of time. It gives OP a chance to respond, *if* OP has an issue with this solution/compromise. SIL could have just gone and done it fait accompli.\n\nIf the OP didn't make it clear that she wanted to be first, then there was some possible miscommunication. So that's why my advice was to clear up that potential miscommunication.\n\n>Is it unreasonable for someone to ask for a small favor, knowing that it means so much to them and so little to you?\n\nIt is not unreasonable to ask. It *is* unreasonable to expect or demand. This is where the line so often falls on these AITA questions.\n\n>choosing to renege on her agreement\n\nAgain, perception. My benefit of the doubt is saying she simply saw a convenient compromise opportunity and is taking that instead. \"Because they are visiting anyway.\" A change in circumstances often necessitates a change in the agreement. That's not unusual.\n\nAgain, it all hinges on her reaction after the reiteration I suggested, assuming that was done in time, assuming that's what OP chooses to do. If not then it still kind of hinges on her personality and attitude and such. I don't think miscommunication makes people AH, and I still see a potential that miscommunication is what might have happened here.\n\n>She knows this will upset OP and is doing it anyways\n\nIf that's correct, then you're right. I just don't think there's enough evidence to prove that this is how SIL is thinking and feeling about the situation. That's mindreading territory. I don't mindread. It's possible she could be feeling this, but so far there's no data to prove it.\n\nIt's possible that she thinks this compromise will *appease* the OP which is why she offered it. I see that as at least a *possible* explanation of her actions until more data proves one way or the other. So, benefit of the doubt.\n\n\\~\n\nHowever, as a hypothetical, say SIL never agreed at all; I don't think she'd be wrong to do so. It's her life, her pregnancy, she announces it, the end. If that had been the case, I wouldn't call SIL an AH. Apathetic and uncaring, when you are under no obligation to be caring, is not an AH. It's a default state we all live in. Only if there was malicious intent would that act rate AH level.\n\nOr, to put it another way, being kind to others is a default state too, when it's not at cost to yourself. There's a level of common decency you can expect from others...and no more. Expecting them to do more than that, such as, say, delaying the announcement of their own pregnancy, delaying the knowledge of existence of someone's grandchild, and so on, needs a little bit bigger reason than \"because it'd make me feel better.\" The bigger the cost, the bigger the reason necessary for it to balance out and meet the 'common decency' level.\n\nIn my subjective opinion, announcing a pregnancy shouldn't really be anyone's business but the person's announcing it. Making it your business because you're going to feel some kind of way about the effects afterwards is already a bit of a stretch...but I'm allowing OP this because their feelings are valid and they were polite when they asked. It never hurts to *ask*. You just have to accept that 'no' is a possible answer. Otherwise you aren't exactly asking.\n\nNext hypothetical: If SIL is truly 'reneging' on her agreement, she would be an AH for breaking a promise moreso than she'd be an AH for causing all the overshadowing and whatnot, because of the previous point.", "People tend to use the term friend so loosely that I take it with a grain of salt. Do you talk to her about how you feel like you are treated less than her husband is?", "I announced to close family and friends as soon as I knew because I knew if something did happen I\u2019d want their support.

Miscarriage risk does go down at 12 weeks, but it is *still* there, same with possibility of defects, which most people do not learn about until 20 weeks.. and stillbirth beyond that.
