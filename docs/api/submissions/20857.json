Are you that much of an alcoholic that uou can't wait until after?", "YTA. What's Catholic got to do with it. I'm Irish and nobody I know would chug a pint before a funeral. You would have to give your condolences to the family while smelling of beer. There's also the matter of treating those proceedings with a bit of tact and class. For that brief hour or two you share in the family's grief and support them with your respectful presence. And you had your first drink before the chief mourners did. And it was your wife's friend, not yours. Really dumb behaviour, how could you not expect her to be pissed off.", "N T A for giving people you don't know $20 for their honeymoon but YTA for chugging a beer before the funeral assuming the co-worker was a friend and your wife was grieving. You couldn't support your wife without alcohol or simply waited till after the funeral to drink?", "Time and place dude, YTA", "Where was your wife while you were doing this bizarre thing? Just waiting for you? If you came to the funeral solo, then fine, but this is serious YTA territory if you're there to support your wife", "YTA. I'm not sure how you and your wife go in together and only you end up at the wrong party. If I were your wife I'd be peed about the drinking and leaving her alone while she wanted you to be with her while she buries her co-worker. You were supposed to support her, but you didn't take it seriously and rather chose to leave her alone (yes, she most likely knew more people from work there, but you were her rock). The random day drinking is also worrying. I'm sure there would've been non-alcoholic drinks if you just wanted to give some money for the honeymoon fund. You didn't even enjoy the drink but chucked it like a frat boy at a party. All the other people who knew the dead would have a valid reason to drink, you did it out of boredom and for fun. Like you need to be intoxicated to tolerate those grieving people. \n\nFor the wedding crashing: I wouldn't mind it personally. It was an honest mistake and some stranger buying a drink to support the fund would be a funny story. If you weren't supposed to be at the funeral of course.", "I'm having a hard time deciding on this one.\nA random couple got an extra 20$ for their honeymoon, and I would definitely need a drink before going to a stranger's funeral too.\nI'm gonna say YTA, because your wife needed support, and you could've waited until after the funeral.\n(But also, I think this is amazing and I'm officially inviting you to my open bar funeral party, stay thirsty my friend)", "YTA. Not your wedding. No respect for the grieving family. Might I suggest AA?", "YTA\n\nYour wife was attending a coworkers funeral and whether you think its a big deal or not, people will judge you for drinking before a funeral, but more importantly they will judge your wife.\n\nIf you were attending a funeral of someone you actually knew then behave how you want but in this instance you were representing your wife and you fucked up. The fact that you can't understand that is just bad relationship behaviour and your wife has every right to be pissed", "You really just had to go to the bar, even when you realized you were in the wrong area, because you just had to have a drink? Was the idea of a funeral so horrible or something that you needed a drink first?\n\nHonestly, your wife is right, you were disrespectful, and shouldn't have drunk before the funeral. YTA", "YTA totally. Just because it was a cash bar doesn\u2019t mean you are entitled to buy a drink from it. You were not invited to that wedding. It could have also been a limited bar. The couple provided bar service for their guests, not for strangers. Wearing formal attire and tipping the bartender does not make it acceptable to crash somebody\u2019s wedding. Does this really need explained to an adult?\n\nSecond its simply totally classless and disrespectful to stop and chug a beer at the wedding next door before a funeral. Like really, just stop and think about it for one second. That\u2019s a terrible look, probably embarrassed your wife, and shows your priority is drinking alcohol before showing up for the actual people in your life. Imagine if it was your loved one who died and someone\u2019s husband was out in the hallway, chugging a beer before they came in. Like really, you couldn\u2019t wait one hour for your drink? It\u2019s just low class and ignorant behavior.\n\nWhat you should\u2019ve done is when you walked into the wrong room and saw a bar, you should\u2019ve thought to yourself, \u201cwow, wouldn\u2019t it be great if I was a guest at this wedding and could buy a beer here?

If my spouse was upset about me drinking before an event, I would listen to them. I am also a bit of a lightweight so maybe a beer for OP is negligible.", "My best friends dad died. I went to the funeral with her. Her mom\u2026.dads ex was there but there was a bar next door. She definitely got some drinks first but she was and still is an alcoholic.

I can see telling that as a weird wedding story for years. \"this one guy popped out of a funeral to buy a beer at our bar, downed it, dropped 20 bucks in the honeymoon fund, and got back to it.

Its very weird to me that NTAs here have no sense of the \"relativity\" of whats appropriate.  In a vacuum, what OP did was a bit curious but harmless.  But its not a vacuum, the context is that he chugged a beer in a place unrelated to the funeral when he was presumably there to support his wife.  It shows how that he has no regard for the solemnity/seriousness of the funeral, doesnt care how his actions reflect on his wife, and is just in it for himself.  Yes, OP *could* have a drink but the question is *why* he thought he *should,* given the circumstances.", "Thank you for pointing this out. Im shocked that N T A is the general consensus.

Who cares? Nobody is going to notice one random guy, and why would they care if he paid $20 for one beer and left?", "OP didn\u2019t crash the wedding.

If it was HIS friend or family, I would say N T A although I agree with the top comment - dude get a mixed drink, don\u2019t chug a beer like you\u2019re at a frat party, that\u2019s so freaking disrespectful.\n\nBut the fact that it\u2019s HER coworker and he\u2019s supposed to be there to support her, her colleagues are there, so it\u2019s also like a non drinking work function, this would be so infuriating to me if my husband embarrassed me like that and i wouldn\u2019t take him to another event again. \n\nAgain, his family, his friends, I wouldn\u2019t give a shit", "Why?", "Yeah, I mean it\u2019s basically like when your partner takes you to an office holiday party where you don\u2019t really know anyone, and I usually feel like having a drink just so I can make it through the awkward gauntlet of talking to a bunch of people who all share a history and talk about work stuff you don\u2019t understand.

Personally don't drink but almost everyone else, including the priest, had flasks/drinks in hand.", "Heck, I'm reeling at the idea of a church selling alcohol.  I've never been to a wedding, funeral, or other church service and seen alcohol served!", "Jesus I can\u2019t fucking imagine! My husband was Muslim so no drinking but I definitely could have used one! Much love on your journey from another fellow younger widow!", "Haha, yes, it's hard to surpass New Orleans in that department!", "Which is ironic and evil. Evil because people want those in poverty to have any and all miseries rained down on them. Ironic, because poverty is one of the main drivers of birth rates. Lack of access to sex ed., contraception, abortion, and a dire need for more household members to be earners and help provide the family with the necessities of life. Children are one of the only avenues to easing the conditions of poverty that we leave avaliable to the poor, because we need them to breed new laborers, and then we shame them for taking it when the system is set up to make them do it. \n\nSick all around tbh", "I was on acid as an altar boy with the bishop. I was a messed up 15 year old. But the free wine in the back was nice."]}
