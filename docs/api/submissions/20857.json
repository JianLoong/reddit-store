You could've just gotten a beer after the funeral for fuck sake.", "YTA not because like other people are implying that you are an alcoholic - I don't believe that for a second.\n\nThis was for a work colleague of your wife. I presume there were other colleagues of hers there.

Instead of focusing on the memorial service and supporting your wife and those who were close to the deceased, you decided to grab a beer. You didn't need it. You weren't altruistically funding their honeymoon. You just \\*really\\* wanted a drinky drink.

Not specifically invading a wedding reception while attending a funeral, but I mean prioritizing getting a beer \u201cjust cuz\u201d when it isn\u2019t specifically a part of the agenda for whatever you\u2019re doing with your wife?

I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s quite AH territory, (that would really depend on how close to this coworker she was and how much of an emotional toll the loss has on her) but regardless it is cringey and you should still probably apologize to her for being a dumbass. You were attending a funeral with your wife and instead of making a point to stay at her side and support her, you decided to go pound a beer at a bar that was part of a reception you weren\u2019t invited to.

Could\u2019ve just waited.", "Yup, YTA. Why was your wish to have a beer at that moment more important than supporting your wife in mourning her colleague? It was an inappropriate time to have a beer, to say the least.

Should have saved a little to pour over the coffin outta respect.", "NTA you sound like my kind of dude. You hurt no one and helped someone. Take it as it comes friend.", "NTA.  You went in the wrong door, and made the best of it.  And threw in a little goodwill to a random other couple's honeymoon fund without making any scene whatever.  Anyone who begrudges you a small drink before a funeral does not understand funerals. If you'd stayed there and gotten wasted, sure then YTA.

Many of us have a problematic relationship with it.
