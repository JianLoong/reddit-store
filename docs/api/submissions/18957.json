Your father is also trying to invalidate your justified offense to your stepmother's racism for his own benefit.   \n\n\nStep mother needs to apologize; your father needs parenting classes. You're right to not go.", "NTA you are half your mom so that slur was directed at you as well. If your dad doesn't understand that then he needs to apologize too.", "NTA not wanting to be around people who uses slurs is a fair boundary.", "First off, you're NTA because racial slurs are never ok and she should definitely apologise and learn from this. \n\nSecondly though- how old is your dad? If he is a similar age to your mum, why is he dating someone in her 20s? Thats really weird and gross.", "NTA, and you are not overreacting, it\u2019s your mom and it\u2019s not funny. She shouldn\u2019t say anything about your mom, it\u2019s none of her business. You are setting good boundaries, keep it up, my friend.", "NTA. She should apologies. Racial slurs are disgusting, and of course now she is trying to pull \"I am just joking\" card.", "NTA - she should definitely apologize since it was wrong and discriminatory/racist. Why would anyone just express those sentiments - says a lot about their character and *especially* in light of the fact that it's your mom. Your dad is the one who needs to rectify the situation- not you. He should state that she is the mother of his child and it's not okay. You expressed your feelings, it's the principle of the matter. I commend you.", "NTA", "NTA! 1) Racial slurs are never okay. 2) Insulting your mother in front of you is disrespectful. 3) Your dad defended your stepmom's behavior. \n\nStick to your guns. They have to learn they overstepped in a big way.", "NTA. She should apologize. Whether she likes her or not, the woman she was dissing is your mother and that is not okay, especially a racial slur. If your dad acknowledged what she said wasn\u2019t nice, but then doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re owed an apology and should get over it, he\u2019s an AH as well as his girlfriend. Your mom handled that well.", "NTA.... What an AH move of her, behind ber back as well... You should absolutely demand an apoligy, and if she refuses, it just shows her personality.", "NTA. Not only did she use a slur, she was referring to your mom. She deliberately insulted your mom, and in doing so she insulted you. Stepmom owes you both a sincere apology.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
