Your father is also trying to invalidate your justified offense to your stepmother's racism for his own benefit.   \n\n\nStep mother needs to apologize; your father needs parenting classes. You're right to not go.", "NTA you are half your mom so that slur was directed at you as well. If your dad doesn't understand that then he needs to apologize too.", "NTA not wanting to be around people who uses slurs is a fair boundary.", "First off, you're NTA because racial slurs are never ok and she should definitely apologise and learn from this. \n\nSecondly though- how old is your dad? If he is a similar age to your mum, why is he dating someone in her 20s? Thats really weird and gross.", "NTA, and you are not overreacting, it\u2019s your mom and it\u2019s not funny. She shouldn\u2019t say anything about your mom, it\u2019s none of her business. You are setting good boundaries, keep it up, my friend.", "NTA. She should apologies. Racial slurs are disgusting, and of course now she is trying to pull \"I am just joking\" card.", "NTA - she should definitely apologize since it was wrong and discriminatory/racist. Why would anyone just express those sentiments - says a lot about their character and *especially* in light of the fact that it's your mom. Your dad is the one who needs to rectify the situation- not you. He should state that she is the mother of his child and it's not okay. You expressed your feelings, it's the principle of the matter. I commend you.", "NTA", "NTA! 1) Racial slurs are never okay. 2) Insulting your mother in front of you is disrespectful. 3) Your dad defended your stepmom's behavior. \n\nStick to your guns. They have to learn they overstepped in a big way.", "NTA. She should apologize. Whether she likes her or not, the woman she was dissing is your mother and that is not okay, especially a racial slur. If your dad acknowledged what she said wasn\u2019t nice, but then doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re owed an apology and should get over it, he\u2019s an AH as well as his girlfriend. Your mom handled that well.", "NTA.... What an AH move of her, behind ber back as well... You should absolutely demand an apoligy, and if she refuses, it just shows her personality.", "NTA. Not only did she use a slur, she was referring to your mom. She deliberately insulted your mom, and in doing so she insulted you. Stepmom owes you both a sincere apology.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

And your dad defending her is just as screwed up as her comment. He\u2019s ok with his wife disrespecting and being racist about your mom in front of you. They\u2019re both disgusting", "It\u2019s perfectly normal not to want to spend time at the home of a person who runs down your mom. \n\nYour SM is old enough to know better and an apology for her language isn\u2019t to much of an ask.  \n\nBe ready for your dad to dig in his heels or eve  disinvite you if you insist but I think you\u2019ll be glad you maintained your boundaries. \n\nNTA", "Even though your mother didn\u2019t really care, you did care and your stepmother\u2019s comments offended you. You\u2019re NTA for wanting an apology for those comments.", "NTA. As an Asian person with an Asian mom, I honestly wouldn't let it go until she apologized and would probably avoid interacting with her from now on because she just showed her true racist colors.", "My dad is 48", "NTA", "Gross. Also, racism is never a joke. You are doing the right thing.", "You were honestly nicer than I would have been. Not only did she use a racial slur, she also insulted your mother (and indirectly you). An apology is the least she can do. Nta", "NTA your half the same race as your mom, she was being racist to you too", "Where does it say that she is white?  I must have missed that", "Still her age has nothing to do with the problem.", "NTA... racism is always wrong.", "NTA\nShe should apologize not you", "My moms ex used a racial slur used against Muslims against anyone not white, even his mixed kids. My mom excused it to the fact that in his teen days it wasn\u2019t a racial slur and he didn\u2019t mean anything about it. Didn\u2019t make stop thinking about what he said about me when I couldn\u2019t hear ( biracial ) when he was able to call his own kids slurs. NTA", "NTA but your father is so much of an asshole I don\u2019t know where to begin.  He is married to a racist witch.  Not only did he allow this witch to use a racist, inappropriate slur, he allowed her to insult the mother of his child and his child.  They both owe you and your mother a massive apology and you should not return until they learn respect.  While your mother may not care on her part she should be angry on your behalf.", "Thank you for the input however I still cannot find where op mentions anyone\u2019s race but her mom.  I will read again unless you can copy paste for me !  Thanks!", "NTA. Your father essentially has no problem with his wife calling you a slur.  She should apologize as should he.  It\u2019s not a joke; that\u2019s just what people say to make it be okay to use the slur.  I\u2019d also want her to explain, in detail, what exactly the joke was.\n\nJoke: noun: definition \n-a thing that someone says to cause amusement or laughter, especially a story with a funny punchline.", "Definitely NTA!  No one should talk about someone\u2019s mom or use racial slurs", "NTA. You're half your mom, so the slur applies to you, too! Ask your dad how he's okay with his racist partner making remarks that apply to you as well. Then, ask if he agrees with her since he laughed. You will know what your next steps are from there.", ">Few days ago she mentions my mom talking to my dad and jokingly calls her a slur. My mom is Asian. My dad just laughed\n\nDad's white; whatever stepmother is doesn't matter. OP is half Asian and is being told hearing slurs against her/their/his bio mom isn't worth being mad over.", "Aah, so he was 22 when she was born.", "Does your dad not realize she is also disrespecting you with the slur, since you know, you are half asian?", "yea my dad is white and my step mom is black. I didn't mention their race because I didn't think it was relevant.", "That doesn't mean dad is white. It means he is not Asian.", "Not saying you are necessarily wrong here but can we stop assuming every person saying something racist or laughing about something racist is white. She literally said nowhere that the dad was white. In fact he could even be asian and still find the \"joke\" funny (not likely but still a possibility).", "He does but I don't think he cares.He enjoys racist comedy and tells other people to stop being so serious take a joke.", "I would be that petty person who finds a way to comment about me being half whatever the racial slur was\u2026 especially in front of other people. I bet it\u2019s not such a funny thing when the slur is aired publicly. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. And yes other minorities can be racist. Especially to biracial children. She wasn\u2019t just talking about your mother but you.", "NTA your step said something racist about your mother, and you by default. That was completely inappropriate and the fact your father didn't back you up, that's messed up.", "NTA. Not only did she use a slur against your mom but you as well. You don\u2019t owe her an apology", "Causal racism is still racism. The problem with casual is that it then slowly allows racism to become accepted.\n\nNTA", "It\u2019s not relevant because racial slurs are not a joke! Calling someone out for being a racist jerk is not over reacting. Your dad should be furious with her since she has essentially displayed her racism to you too. NTA", "Would he think it was \"funny\" if you called your stepmother a racist or ethnic slur?", "NTA. Calling your bio mom a racial slur is also calling you the same thing. Your dad laughing and saying you\u2019re overreacting is saying he agrees with the slur. They BOTH owe you an apology.", "NTA not only is what she said and your dad laughing at it terrible in general because it's racist, but also you're half Asian meaning it was direct insult towards you and your own mother. It's completely understandable to find an insult towards you and your mother well... insulting, and doubly so since it was a freaking racist slur. She and your dad should both apologize.", "NTA. She absolutely should apologize and your Dad is mad because he knows his daughter is showing him up and making him feel like an AH. Good for you!", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/140h3rt/aita_for_saying_my_step_mom_should_apologise/jmxcbps/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3", "Thanks!", "Ok but the op stated in a comment he is white, yours and ops comment were both posted 5 hours ago so I don\u2019t know which came first."]}
