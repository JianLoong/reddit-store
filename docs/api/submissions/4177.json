{"id": 4177, "submission_id": "zf2ooe", "title": "AITA for refusing to let a disabled family member stay at my place?", "selftext": "My cousin was disabled in an accident.  He's currently working on regaining mobility, but its going to take a long time. He has his own apartment with a roommate but he can't manage on his own yet and his roommates aren't caretakers.  He's essentially being kicked out.\n\nI have a spare bedroom at my house and I've been asked by family to take him in.  Other relatives don't have spare room for him.  I refused because at my house, all of the bedrooms are on the second floor and he's not able to walk up and down the stairs.  \n\nHe's stayed at my house in the past and it was pretty bad.  For example, for pest control reasons, we don't allow eating in the bedrooms.  We do make exceptions (such as having a mini fridge with juice & snacks for blood sugar emergencies).  This cousin on several occasions was caught sneaking food into his room so he wouldn't have to interrupt his video gaming with having to go downstairs to eat.  Also he spilled food and drinks on the bed, and when he left the room had a stench that took months to disappear.  We ended up throwing out the sheets and had to buy a new mattress as well.  After he left we also found roaches in his room and had to have pest control come multiple times for treatment.\n\nSo due to past history we're not thrilled at the request to house him until he's better.  We're refusing on an entirely safety reason.  There's no way he's going to be moving up and down the stairs, and I'm not going to be his caretaker because I have a toddler, I'm pregnant, and I'm working.  I have no energy left to deal with his shit.  In fact the room that they want him to stay in is the room that I've been turning into the nursery for the new baby.\n\nI'm being called an asshole because he's family and needs help due to the accident, but I don't want to be caretaker for a manchild with shit hygiene who didn't follow house rules in the past.  I feel bad for him because he has completely lost his independence and has broken down crying every time he talks about how hard he's trying.  We know it'll take months, possibly years to fully recover, if even possible.  But I don't want to deal with this.\n\nAITA?\n\n\nEdit: I had a chat with my cousin and it seems like there's a lot of assumptions and miscommunication going on.  He is insisting that he can live independently, and doesn't want to go to **any** relatives house.  He's been in a vulnerable state and he doesn't want to be viewed as a burden, and more importantly doesn't want to be seen.  Honestly he needs a heavy dose of therapy.  Everybody else is of the opinion that he needs to be monitored because they are afraid he'll get hurt living alone and should be staying with someone.\n\nAnyways, he had already talked to his apartment and was told there's a ground floor studio opening up in late January, so he can transfer his lease to there.  His roommates couldn't technically kick him out because of the lease but there was already a lot of tension and arguments happening so he chose to leave on his own.  I brought up a having home aide and while he says he doesn't need one, I told him to consider a part time one so that they can at least cook meals for him because eating takeout everyday isn't healthy at all.  They can do things like light cleaning and taking out the trash or doing the laundry because his shit is filthy.  He agreed that someone coming by to cook and clean would be a big help.\n\nI also told him that if he wants to live alone, that he needs to have a life alert service because if he falls, nobody would know about it for hours or days.  I even offered to pay for it, but he said it's for old people and doesn't need it because his smartwatch can call 911 if needed.\n\nI'm going to respect his decision for now, but I'm also going to be keeping an eye on him.  You guys make it sound like bridges should be burning with all family members, but we're all trying to look out for each other at heart.", "created_utc": 1670423899, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zf2ooe/aita_for_refusing_to_let_a_disabled_family_member/", "score": 743, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Anyone that asks you, tell them that \"it's not possible for us\" or \"we aren't able to have houseguests at this time.\" or \"We already told you that we cannot take him in, please do not ask us again.\"  You don't need the extra stress that they are trying to put on you, not with all that you have happening in your own life right now.", "NTA, but I understand why you feel bad. However this is a situation that a parent or someone that doesn't have a young child should step up and take charge of. I think they're trying to make you do it, because they don't want to.", "NTA..and you don\u2019t have a spare room, it is going to be the nursery.  And you know, your family just wants you to be the caretaker.  Tell your cousin and family, nope.  Number one, you don\u2019t have room.  Number two, you have two young children, or will, you cannot be anyone else\u2019s caregiver and three, state all those other reasons.  But since they all seem so willing to tell you that you should do this because he is family, that you are sure since they are also family, they can take care of him.  You have already done your share.", "Exactly. I get that maybe no one else has a whole spare room (though that in itself seems far fetched) but that none of the flying monkeys have a living room or a dining room that they could convert specifically for his care? Nope, they're just passing the buck.", "And the stench from poor hygiene... He sounds like a parody of gamers, like that episode of South Park.", "NTA... because he has been a slob when he had the ability to clean up after himself. Now he needs both a nurse and a cleaner and you are not willing or able to be such. \n\nOn that note. If family wants to provide a full time nurse and a cleaner?", "Nta. You should just lead with you are tired and pregnant and can\u2019t physically take care of him and your spare room is meant to be the nursery. You can\u2019t do it. Nta at all.", "NTA you don't have to take care of someone who even before being disabled doesn't respect your house rules. Also, the same way you can become your nursery room into a room for him, your family could make space for him if they wanted to. It looks like if anyone wanted to keep him and since you received him once they want to throw you the problem.\n\nYou are pregnant, it doesn't even make sense to put you in that situation, they should be asking you if you need help", "NTA  \n\n\nits not a spare room its  your child's room, and your child is even closer family so that outranks his faimly clami", "NTA\n\nYou are NOT his caretaker, and your home is NOT set up for a person with limited mobility.  \n\nThe fact that he has already shown he has no respect for you is separate.", "NTA, like the roommates, you are also not a caretaker.  If your cousin could be independent, they would be, but your family is looking for anyone but them to be a caretaker, and so are guilting you to try and force you to be that, all so they don't have to.", "NTA and I would say not to do it based on the hygiene issues as well as the inaccessibility of the room. You can't be bringing in filth and roaches when you are going to have a baby, and you can't be his caretaker as well *as you're having a baby.*  \n\n\nI and my SO are disabled and live independently. They are a quadriplegic and I am a paraplegic. I take care of daily stuff for us (admittedly with some difficulty) and we have someone come once a week to do a deeper cleaning to make sure our living conditions stay decent. We pay for this out of pocket as sweetie lost their aidecare due to my cancer fundraiser.  \n\n\nWe have stayed with relatives before but it did not go well (we were being abused) and so would rather live on our own. He needs to figure out his situation, and if he's going to stay with people he needs to figure out how to stay on top of his hygiene and cleanliness. It's easy for that to get away from you when you're disabled but there are options.", "NTA. All your reasons are valid but one that stands out the most is that your house is not disability-friendly. They want him to stay somewhere where he\u2019s either trapped in his room or can\u2019t get to it??", "NTA, how old is he? Can't his own folks be his caretakers?", "NTA.", "op=NTA\n\nFamily can jointly fund him a place to stay(and a caretaker) because you know they'll expect you to be his caretaker as well as provide room and board.\n\nDon't do it.  There is nothing to show he's changed his behavior and now he's no longer physically able to do what he DIDN'T do before.", "NTA He had a chance once before and blew it. He has lost the chance of being helped by you for previous bad behaviour. Karma has bitten him in the bum. You cannot ignore his previous conduct. It has to be no. He has burnt his bridges. You work, have a toddler and are pregnant, you cannot take care of him.", "you DON\u2019T have a spare room, it\u2019s your nursery.\n\nWhilst it\u2019s an unfortunate situation, you are not obligated to house him (especially with his previous history).\n\nIf they are that concerned they can rent a room for him somewhere. \n\nNTA", "NTA. He can get a small apartment on the first floor with no stairs. There are organizations that send out home health aids for people in his situation, many are government funded as well.", ">I upvote this so many times!!!", "I love that a guy with terrible hygiene is a prideful person.", "OP doesn\u2019t have a spare room anymore either. It\u2019s been converted to a nursery.", "Youre pregnant, have a toddler, and he is an awful guest. And they expect you to be his butler. Yeah no thanks. NTA", "Is he a legal adult? He needs to request assistance from the rehab center or his physician in the form of a temporary case manager who can help him make the arrangements needed for the best possible recovery, including helping him apply for temporary in-home services.\n\nNone of that involves him needing to live with you or requiring that you become his home health aide. The family can't let him pull everyone in circles with his insistence that he doesn't need help. I get that it is hard to acknowledge when you need significant help (been there, done that, was in a terrible vehicle accident years ago). But there ARE services. There IS assistance. And it's not reasonable for him to expect family members to carry this. Really, to keep your sanity and allow you to focus on your own family I'd suggest that you simply insist he ask for help through the rehab center and stop trying to offer him suggestions, etc. I know this sounds cold but he doesn't sound like he has a realistic perspective at all, and the rest of you are going to end up dealing with the consequences.", "NTA. I saw your edit. Everyone needs to respect his decision. He\u2019s an adult and if he wants to live on his own then that\u2019s what he\u2019ll do. You don\u2019t have to be burdened with his care. Let him live with his life choices.", "OMG,NTA NTA NTA! You are not obligated to do this at all! Yeah,he's family,but you have given several extremely valuable reasons not to do it. He would have to go upstairs in his condition,they ARE expecting you to be his caretaker,you are pregnant,with a toddler AND working,you have more than enough on your plate right now ,you have your pregnant self and a toddler to take care of,you need to think about your own health and well being. Plus your cousin has stayed with you before and was a complete pig with no respect for your house. No way. I wouldn't host him either. If everyone else is so worried about it,they can let him live in their living room or band together and help him get a place.       It's sounds like he is getting a studio apt,and you said you'll keep an eye on him. That needs to be shared with your family as well. It's good that you care about him. But that doesn't mean you have to sacrifice your house and whole life to take care of him. Your relatives were wrong.", "I have friends who I would do anything for and family members I wouldn't piss on if they were on fire...\n\nOut of all the comments on this thread this one was really funny and relatable af.", "I saw your edit, and wanted to mention that his smart watch is probably sufficient replacement for a life alert system. One evening not too long ago, a friend of mine was walking from her car to a hotel where she was meeting a visiting friend; the next thing she knew, she was sitting on a gurney on the sidewalk, next to an ambulance with flashing lights. She had suddenly fainted, fallen to the ground, and struck her head on the curb. Her Apple watch detected her fall, called 911, and sent the ambulance directly to her. She has since taken to telling everyone she knows who lives alone (or, really, ever goes anywhere alone) that they should get an Apple watch.", "The pride thing will be your biggest obstacle. Phrase things in terms of speeding up his recovery and regaining his independence. It puts him back in control where your family is trying to take that away (whether they realise or not). His recovery will be more successful if he keeps a steady pace and doesn't over-exert himself with everyday tasks (like cleaning etc). Getting into a routine (like bathing) will allow him to measure his progress as it'll be obvious as things become easier. A home-aide can be temporary and the help adjusted as he regains more capability for himself. It also allows him to focus on the big stuff like his therapies.\n\nSounds to me like you are the only one so far who is actually asking him what he wants so NTA at all.", "NTA\n\nAlso, remind your cousin that a lot of people pay money for things like housekeeping and meal prep. Some of us just have things we\u2019d rather be doing with our time. He\u2019s got a lot of non-disabled company.", "NTA. You mentioned the room they wanted him to use is going to be for the nursery.  Do you even have a full bathroom on the 1st floor or are they all on the 2nd floor. He was already proved he's a bit if a stinker. You don't want have to help with a bed bath. This maybe partly why roomies want him out. His hygiene wasn't good before.  It's probably worse now.", "NTA, anyway. It's weird that a cousin would be expected to take him in and not a sibling or parent, regardless. Glad he found his own solution.", "I just had a similar experience. I didn\u2019t faint or black out but I tripped and fell at work and my Apple Watch detected the fall and immediately asked if 911 needed to be called. If I hadn\u2019t answered within a specific timeframe, it would\u2019ve called them. Instead, I had it call my emergency contact so he could come bring me to ER. I broke my humerus at the shoulder and my patella (kneecap). So yes. Apple Watch\u2019s fall detection can be a life saver", "Oh my goodness, you poor thing! I'm so sorry you suffered those injuries, and I certainly hope you recover swiftly."]}
