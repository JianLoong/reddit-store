He's currently working on regaining mobility, but its going to take a long time. He has his own apartment with a roommate but he can't manage on his own yet and his roommates aren't caretakers.  He's essentially being kicked out.\n\nI have a spare bedroom at my house and I've been asked by family to take him in.  Other relatives don't have spare room for him.  I refused because at my house, all of the bedrooms are on the second floor and he's not able to walk up and down the stairs.  \n\nHe's stayed at my house in the past and it was pretty bad.  For example, for pest control reasons, we don't allow eating in the bedrooms.  We do make exceptions (such as having a mini fridge with juice & snacks for blood sugar emergencies).  This cousin on several occasions was caught sneaking food into his room so he wouldn't have to interrupt his video gaming with having to go downstairs to eat.  Also he spilled food and drinks on the bed, and when he left the room had a stench that took months to disappear.  We ended up throwing out the sheets and had to buy a new mattress as well.  After he left we also found roaches in his room and had to have pest control come multiple times for treatment.\n\nSo due to past history we're not thrilled at the request to house him until he's better.  We're refusing on an entirely safety reason.  There's no way he's going to be moving up and down the stairs, and I'm not going to be his caretaker because I have a toddler, I'm pregnant, and I'm working.  I have no energy left to deal with his shit.  In fact the room that they want him to stay in is the room that I've been turning into the nursery for the new baby.\n\nI'm being called an asshole because he's family and needs help due to the accident, but I don't want to be caretaker for a manchild with shit hygiene who didn't follow house rules in the past.  I feel bad for him because he has completely lost his independence and has broken down crying every time he talks about how hard he's trying.  We know it'll take months, possibly years to fully recover, if even possible.

Are you supposed to be his caretaker?  Is able to use the restroom by himself, bathe himself? Does he have a home health aide that helps? You are having a baby, therefore you no longer have an extra room nor do you need the stress. Not to mention how horrible of a house guest he was last time when he was able bodied. Everyone wants to call you an AH because they don\u2019t want to do it themselves.", "NTA\n\nYou are pregnant and have a toddler, and you are working. Depending on how disabled he is, you would also become his caretaker and he would be reliant upon you. Even without his past issues and your past experiences with him living with you, it\u2019s okay to tell them no. It\u2019s okay to set boundaries.\n\n\nIf the other relatives want to call you names or be rude about it, ask them why they refuse to make room for him. If they want him to stay somewhere so badly, why don\u2019t they use their money to get him a place? Have you asked them why they expect you to take responsibility for someone that they won\u2019t? \n\nFor them to insult you for saying no is really manipulative, toxic and abusive. \nI suggest going low or no contact, if you can. That sounds unhealthy. And I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with that while you already have your hands so full! They should be offering to help you with things.\n\nNot asking you and verbally assaulting you into helping someone else.", "NTA\n\n* You don't *have* an extra room; that's the nursery.\n* Even if you *did* have an extra room, it's upstairs where he can't get to it. He'd need to stay downstairs on a hired hospital bed or something; surely he could do that just as easily at his parents' (or another relative's) place. \n* You're pregnant and have a young toddler; you can't be a caretaker for him too. So he'd still need a caretaker.\n\nHe could hire (a) caretaker(s) to allow him to live at his own place (they don't have to be live-in; around here they come in 8-hour shifts), or stay in a rehab facility, or rent a bed and stay in a closer relative's living room.", "NTA \n\nHe can\u2019t get up and down stairs you are pregnant, have a toddler and you work.

Don't let other people bully you.", "NTA - your house, your rules.\n\nYou don't even need a reason to say no but since his history its fair to refuse.", "NTA. It sucks that he's going through this but it's clear you just don't have the resources, tangible or otherwise, to give him what he needs. Maybe see if a nearby assisted living facility would be willing to take him in for a bit.", "NTA. He literally can\u2019t go up and down steps. Someone else can make room for him, I\u2019m sure at least one person in your family has a couch. \n\nAfter the roaches and stuff I won\u2019t even want that person back in my home. I\u2019m not even sure I would speak to them? Bloods thick but so was that exterminator bill/new mattress bill/new sheets bill. \n       Don\u2019t let them make you feel bad.", "NTA. You\u2019re just not equipped to meet his needs there and that\u2019s all you need to say.  Of course the rest of the family want you to take him in\u2026 it takes the responsibility of caring for him off their plates.", "NTA. Other family members can step up, even if they don't have a spare bedroom. They can curtain off a dining room or something. \n\nYou have a toddler and infant on the way! Not sure why your family actually thinks you're the best person to handle his care right now. \n\nSorry you're dealing with this. You have  every right to stand firm just on the timing in your life.

What do you want to do, cook for 3 days Sunday-Tuesday or do the laundry those 3 days?  I need to know what days you will be helping ME, the FAMILY member, so I can also call Uncle John to see what days he can come help  ME the FAMILY member to vacuum and dust\".  Try to say this as seriously as you can (without cracking up).\n\n When they stutter and say they are calling for the other family member's needs, tell them YOU need help and if they can't, scream at them I AM FAMILY AND NEED HELP.  Then hang up.  Let them think you are a manic pregnant woman, who cares? <eg>\n\nYOU are going to need HELP as much as anyone else.\n\nOkay, all teasing aside, NTA.  Stand firm.  If the family doesn't like it, they can find a way to take in this slob themselves for as long as they can tolerate it.  **You've done it once already, it is someone else's turn.**  There.  Done.", "NTA.\n\nYou have a family of your own. And he's your COUSIN, not your child.  Where are his parents? Where are his other siblings or other cousins?

It's an unfortunate situation but it's also not your responsibility.", "NTA.  Don't allow him to come back for all the reasons you said.  He is NOT your responsibility.  You could try contacting social services to see if they can provide an aide to help him bathe take care of hygienic needs. \n\nYou said\n\" I have a spare bedroom at my house and I've been asked by family to take him in. Other relatives don't have spare room for him\"\n\nYour spare room will soon be a nursery. Or a.room for relatives who are coming to visit you and help you after the baby is born.\nThe relatives who dont have a spare room have a sofa dont they?  He can stay somewhere without a spare room.  Where was be living before his motility issues began?  Thats is where he needs to return.\n\nIf he moves back to your house, you will never get him to move out and it is def not your burden to bear.  Youve already taken care of him before and he ruined a bunch of your stuff you had to replace, it is his more immediate family's responsibility to care for him - parents brothers or sisters. Not yours.  Worst case scenario the family could chip in to get him a room somewhere.  If he has motility issues does he qualify for disability payments?", "NTA for reasons mentioned above already. I am bewilde by what people in your house do with their snacks if you're worried about pests though! Obviously different for him, I can't even fathom how he managed to bugger up an entire mattress from eating in bed.

That is your child's room. If they say to move your kids in a room together....then they all have the same capability to do that within their house!

He spends most of his day at an outpatient therapy center (I think it includes physical therapy, occupation therapy, and other therapies? I'm not sure).\n\nHe can use the bathroom on his own, and he claims he can bathe, but considering he has a smell, I'm pretty certain he's not doing it daily.\n\nI'll bring up a home health aide with him.  He's a very prideful person and will likely refuse one, but if it allows him to live on his own then maybe it'll give him more semblance of independence.", "This", "I agree with this post, don't feel bad!

At the time we didn't have a kid so we took him in because we could.  The other cousins have no room in their places, or live too far away.\n\nBecause he stayed with us before we were the first option as a \"hey you should have him move back in since he's stayed with you before.\" We haven't shared the aftermath with other family members to save the embarrassment for him.  \n\nWhenever we visit him it's been depressing because he's been having constant breakdowns at feeling helpless and abandoned.  I really feel bad for him, but I can feel bad while also not wanting to put up with his shit.", "If he can all this alone and is out most of the day, he wouldn't be kicked out from his roommates. They try to tell you the story as flowery as possible and as soon as he is in your house, he will scream for you to carry him to the toilet because he can't do nothing alone. \n\nAt some points you must bury your pride like after a bad accident and you need help. How would it go with his pride if you become his slave now?", "He can get his doctor to write a prescription for what he needs. He can get one and take care of his needs and stay in his own place. Meals, bathing, cleaning, and shopping would be taken care of. If he wants, he could also choose a family member to be paid to do that work for him. That is called Consumer Directed Services."]}
