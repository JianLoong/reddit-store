She\u2019s a sweet girl and is excited to be a big sister. \n\nYesterday my mother in law came to the house to help me with the baby. Georgia mentioned how cute the baby was and how she wished she could hold him. Being a first time mom I told my boyfriend I didn\u2019t want any kids holding the baby and he respected that and explained it to Georgia. \n\nMy mother in law told Georgia to sit on the couch and hold him. I walked in as she was going to hand Georgia the baby and just mentioned it was time for me to feed the baby. So I took the baby and went to feed him. \n\nMy boyfriend had a talk with his mom. She thinks I\u2019m being selfish and that I can\u2019t keep his sister from holding him. I reminded her that I\u2019m his mother and it makes me uncomfortable with any child holding the baby.

I know you\u2019re nervous as a first-time mom, but she\u2019s sitting down to be safe, and she\u2019s his sister. You might need to lighten up a little.", "YTA. A 9 year old is perfectly capable of holding a baby while sitting on a couch. The only thing you\u2019re succeeding at is making Georgia feel like an outsider.", "You say \"any kids,\" as if some street urchins wanted to hold him. But it was his own sister!!! You should have made her sit on the couch and instructed her how to hold him gently, just for a few minutes, and that she should ask first every time. What you did was cold-hearted. Your MIL was out of line, though, for going against your wishes.\n\nYTA.", "INFO: how long is this rule supposed to be in effect? When will his sister be allowed to hold him?", "Yta.  \n\nThis kid is his sister.", "YTA.  I have lots of photos of my older kids holding their new born siblings.  It\u2019s even. Traditional type of thing for cards.  Like a birth announcement!   \n\nSure, there are lots of rules to be implemented.  Freshly washed hands and face, clean shirt if they were playing outside.  Only while sitting in a specific chair, and most certainly under supervision.  Stuff like that, to ensure safety.  But, no holding?  Why not? I\u2019ve never heard of such a thing.  It almost sounds like you want to alienate the older child, or that you just plain don\u2019t like the older girl.  \n\nDo better.", "YTA - she is his sister it's really shitty to put her on the same level as your nephews and nieces. \n\n9 yo is old enough to understand that a baby needs to be handled gently and you can put the rules washing your hands first, sit down on the couch, mom or dad will putting in your hands you can't take him from his crib.", "YTA, but only in application with your daughter. This is the type of stuff that grows resentment and self-worth issues for a child.\n\nYou could modify the rule to only have Georgia hold your baby within your supervision. It can be a bonding moment for all three of you. (And yes, Georgia NEEDS to bond with her sibling!)", "NAH. You\u2019ve just had a baby a week ago. Your hormones haven\u2019t even normalized and you are a first time mom. I think it\u2019s fine to let her hold him with supervision, but I won\u2019t call you an AH.", "What is with all of these comments? They're focusing so much on letting the kid hold her sister. How come no one is mentioning MIL completely ignoring OP's wishes? OP told her that she didn't want children holding her baby and MIL was all \"I think that's dumb so I'm not going to listen to you.\"\n\nOP, I do think you should let Georgia hold the baby as long as she's sitting down and is supervised. But you are NTA for not letting your MIL ignore your rules as the parent.", "Coming from someone who has never had a baby, only held babies: NAH. I think your mother in law was wrong to start to hand the baby to your step daughter without you being in the room, no matter the age of the baby that\u2019s not right. However, your step daughter is going to want to hold her brother. And as long as she\u2019s never shown violence, there\u2019s not a reason for her to not hold him. \n\nMy suggest: tell her that she must wait a month or two, as babies are really fragile for a few months. Take time to show and explain things, like supporting the head and the soft spot and how to avoid it, and not kissing baby on the mouth or cheek(or face, depending on how you feel about the subject), etc before she holds him. The closer to, I believe, 3 months(again, not a mom so can\u2019t be 100% sure) baby will be able to hold his head up and let SD know that she can hold him when he can start doing that. To add some extra peace of mind: surround SD and the baby with pillows so SD has support under her arms to help with positioning. I was 12 when my mom had my sister, the soft spot and not kissing my sister didn\u2019t bother me, I was more worried about not supporting the head correctly. Hell, my cousin\u2019s baby just turned 1 (technically ~10 months, he was born early), and I finally held him for the first time.\n\nFrom watching my mom and cousins have babies, the first few weeks seem to be the most nerve wracking, once your hormone levels start to come down that should calm down as well. If it doesn\u2019t, see a doctor and discuss post part in anxiety/depression/psychosis. Don\u2019t feel bad for not wanting a bunch of people, especially kids, hold your baby. It\u2019s your first baby, you\u2019re learning how to parent your own child. It\u2019s okay to be overly cautious at first.", "YTA.

Maybe start off with something small like washing baby\u2019s feet, with your guidance?\n\nThis is a new experience for you and big sister. Maybe you can find a way to navigate these changes together. \n\nNTA", "You're getting raked over the coals here, which I think is a little unfair. You're a first time mama who's still full of hormones barely a week out from birth. I get why you're nervous. That being said, Georgia is your child too and wants to be a part of you and her brother. In a safe environment, with you and papa guiding her, she could bond with her new sibling and just generally bond with her new family. As for the MIL? Kick. Her. Out. Now. At least until she can behave and listen to your rules. Going over you and her sons head is going to become a regular thing if you don't set up some dang boundaries. \n\nNAH except for the mother in law not minding her own damn business. \n\nGood luck with your family and enjoy your kids actually liking each other right now lol", "YTA. Even little kids can hold a baby as long as they are supervised and able to understand the need to be gentle.  My older kid held her baby sister the night she came home from the hospital...she was 3.  \n\nUnless you have a specific reason for your SD not to hold him, all you're doing is alienating her.  Not allowing other kids to hold him?  Fine.  But his sister?  Not cool.  \n\nYou have a lot to learn about parenting.", "NTA - It\u2019s completely fine to be worried about how others would handle a new born. They need to respect your boundaries.", "Awww mama.... it's hard to trust anyone with your baby! Sit down with the sister beside you and the baby. Show her how to hold his head and let her hold her brother! If she doesn't do it perfectly the first time (and she won't) correct her nicely. You should be building a relationship with this child not shutting her out. I might add.... she's a future babysitter too!", "NTA \n\nYou're a first time mother, with a newborn. You get to decide. \n\nMy guess is after a couple of weeks, you'll be more comfortable with a child holding him, with supervision. \n\nThis sub tends to have very black and white judgments. I wouldn't take the negative judgments to heart.", "NTA wtf u dont have to let anyone hold your newborn baby if u dont want to\n\nit's only been a week. not holding the baby for a little while longer isn't going to completely prevent them from bonding. take your time.", "YTA. It\u2019s not like some random kid is wanting to take baby to the park for an afternoon. BRAND NEW BIG SISTER wants to hold her BRAND NEW BABY BROTHER! You can absolutely have rules for nibblings and family friends, but you should really consider removing the rule for your daughter. \n\nYou can have a special chair, special pillow, with an adult next to her helping her. You can do so many things to make it a safe experience for little one while making Big Sister so incredibly happy.", "NTA as a big sister to my little sister that's 7 years younger than me who I dropped one time and accidentally let her roll off the couch another time because I wasn't paying attention to her when she was a baby, don't let the Y T A votes throw you off. It's your baby, and you decide who gets to hold them. Yes, you have first-time parent jitters, but it's normal. Kids don't have a big attention span, and just leaving a kid alone with a baby for 5 minutes is enough for something to happen. You can still let her hold the baby, but just be beside her and help her just in case.", "Might be the only one saying it. \nNTA.\n\nYou\u2019re a new mom, of COURSE you\u2019re nervous! Give it time, you\u2019ll be letting Georgia carry the baby all day when you\u2019re ready to let go.

It was very bonding for me", "Sadly this will not help Georgia develop a bond with her brother, maybe she can hold him with you helping? Otherwise be prepared for some issues.", "Oh dear. I was all ready to charge in here and proclaim N T A but then I saw that you're denying your baby's own sister to hold him. I'm all for being a protective momma, but that does seem to be taking it too far. My three-year-old was the third person to hold her brand new baby brother in the hospital. No other kids were allowed, but she was the one rightful exception. \n\nOP, gentle YTA. Please reconsider and find a way to make your boyfriend's daughter feel equally part of the family by letting her hold her brother for a minute.", "I let my 2.5 hold his newborn brother. Yes I was there in inches to protect and catch. But he was sooo happy and so excited to meet his baby brother. \n\nYou are huge YTA", "YTA. For sure. When I had my daughter, my son was 18month old. He sat on his dad's lap and held his baby sister. There are a ton of ways to let her safely hold her baby brother. You give slight \"evil stepmom\" vibes. I just got a bad feeling reading this.", "YTA and I am certain you will be pissy when the half sibling doesn\u2019t want to babysit or have a relationship with your child.

Your hormones are all over the place, you\u2019re exhausted and just generally mental. \n\nBeing a first time mom to boot, all that is emphasized. \n\nThe sister doesn\u2019t need to hold the baby right away, it won\u2019t impact their relationship or bond or anything like that. \n\nOP is allowed to state what she needs to feel comfortable in this crazy time and she can explain that to the 9 year old in a kid friendly and gentle way.", "NTA \nit's your baby. If they can't respect your terms f f them.", "I had my first baby last year. With the exception of nurses at the hospital, no one but my husband and I held him until he was almost 5 weeks old. NTA. Your comfort is most important. \n\n...though you do eventually need to let his sister hold him.", "NTA\n\nYou're a first time mom of a week old baby. It's completely understandable that you would be anxious about anyone holding him let alone a 9-year-old. Just make sure you let the baby bond with his sister once he's a bit stronger.", "Yta, and working on being the evil stepmother. She's not a kid. She's your boyfriend's kid. The sibling of the child. Letting her hold her sibling while closely supervised is the norm. The way you referred to her let's everyone know that there will be obvious distinctions made between the children.", "I was babysitting infants at that age, let alone holding them", "I'm probably going to get downvoted for this, but NTA. There are logical and emotional aspects to this. The logical one is that little kids are pretty much petri dishes for illnesses as their immune systems are still developing. The newborn's immune system is NEW new. It hasn't been exposed to anything (I hope) and it's not even old enough to get vaccinated. Not tossing a newborn around like a hot potato is for it's health.\n\nReason 2: Children are clumsy. It's possible OP simply doesn't want to risk any of the kids accidentally hurting the baby. \n\nEmotional reason: It's OP's first baby. Do I really have to say more?

Get used to kids holding your kid. \n\nSome of the cutest photos I have are of my little nieces and nephews holding my babies. \n\nYou won\u2019t regret it. \n\nMake them sit. Let them hold. Tell them to be gentle and not to touch the soft spots on the head. \n\nMake memories!", "What\u2019s up with all these YTA verdicts???? Kids don\u2019t NEED to hold newborns.

The MIL clearly overstepped boundaries. This is a newborn people. She never said that the daughter wouldn't ever be able to hold him in the future...just not now. People are acting like she's the wicked stepmother. I'm pretty sure that it's actually recommended that it mainly be the parents that interact with the newborn since their immune systems are so weak.", "NTA. I\u2019m a first time mum with an 11 week old and I wouldn\u2019t want any children, relatives or not, holding my little girl. There is too much opportunity for something to go wrong.

Y'all are always screaming about how important boundaries are ESPECIALLY for family. Why are boundaries suddenly not okay for family and children? Your preferences are not everyone's preferences.

NTA ever.", "NTA, MIL sounds like a major AH.", "I'm going against the grain and saying NTA. You are the mom, you decide who holds your child. It would be a nice bonding moment for the new auntie to be able to hold the baby, but there will be plenty of moments when your little one is a bit bigger. \n\nWhen I had my first, my gut told me don't let my 16 year old sister near the baby. My parents wore me down because 'she's so good with kids!'. She held baby, played with and fed him. She seemed comfortable with him and vice versa. I ran to the corner store and back, gone less than 15 minutes... I came back and she's screaming at my baby boy so loud I hear her from the street. Apparently he peed on her because she forgot to cover his bits with a diaper to prevent the inevitable squirt gun. I never allowed her near any of my kids alone ever again. \n\nYou have instincts for a reason. If you don't want kids to hold your baby, that's ok.", "Gentle YTA. I can understand being nervous as a first time mom, but the 9 year old will potentially be resentful of all the extra attention on the baby. Fostering a relationship between them is soooo important, especially for blended families. My (newly) 6 and 4 year old both hold their three month baby sister comfortably and safely. Sometimes, either one can even settle her when she's fussy and I'm doing other things, like cooking or switching over laundry", "YTA. \n\n\"any kid\" Georgia is his half sister.

While I do agree your boyfriends daughter should get to hold her sister, if you are not comfortable with it at the moment teach her how to properly hold your child until you feel like she's ready and sit next to her and bond together. As for your boyfriend's mother, set boundaries before she tries to control what you do with your own kid.

Everyone saying YTA is being way too judgmental. Christ, she just came home with her first baby from the hospital and set a boundary that MIL broke. Georgia can bond without holding him at first, it\u2019s not an irrational thing. Why I\u2019m seeing comments painting her as some evil step mother is beyond me.

Post-partum is already so hard, you\u2019re hormonal, in pain, uncomfortable, and trying to care for this tiny little being that just came out of your body. Newborns are fragile and I can understand why a new mom would be rattled. Hell, I was nervous when the nurses were handling my baby.

It\u2019s completely safe for her to hold the baby while seated with an adult there to supervise.", "As a mom of 4 I understand your hesitancy. It is very scary as a new mom. Babies are far more fragile feeling and smaller than they appear on tv and many people who haven\u2019t been parents can\u2019t imagine the stress of imagining their new baby falling or being hurt. Accidents happen all the time and one of the top causes of infant death is accidents in the home. \n\nThat being said, the sister lives in the home and she is nine. She\u2019s not other kids. The safest thing is for her to learn to interact with the baby in a meaningful and safe way. The last thing you want is for her to try to do it when she knows you\u2019re not around and have an accident. \n\nI strongly suggest doing what your MIL was clearly trying to do and have her sit on the couch or on the floor, place the baby in her arms and keep one arm around them both so that you\u2019re basically both holding the baby. Talk to her about being gentle, supporting the head and never attempting to hold the baby without you or your husband present. Never putting toys or blankets on or around the baby and never going in her room when she\u2019s sleeping. \n\nBeing a guard between your baby and daughter may lead to resentment and jealousy on the older child\u2019s part.", "You don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird that Georgia can\u2019t hold her own brother??", "INFO: Is there a reason you don't want Georgia to bond with her half-brother?", "YTA \n\nMy (full) brother was 9 when I was born and you better believe he held and played with me from the first day. Heck, they even let my nephew, who wasn\u2019t 3 at the time, hold his newborn sister, my niece. Obviously with someone beside him/supporting her in his arms, but he could give her cuddles. Come on OP, I know you as a mother are overprotective, but there should be a limit. She\u2019s your son\u2019s big sister. She clearly loves him", "Gentle YTA. Let her bond with him. As a mum of 3, I can tell you that right now while he's tiny and stays still is the perfect time to let her have him on her lap/arms on the lounge, under supervision. In a few months he'll be much stronger, trying to roll around, sit up etc and just too wriggly and strong for her to safely hold him. If it's done with supervision and with her being shown the proper way, when they're little is a very good time for them to be held by older siblings. Don't make her feel like a bad guy or an outsider when she's excited and wants to love on her brother. If you really don't want her to hold him yet, then when she asks instead of enforcing a rule and making her feel bad, get her to snuggle up next to you while you hold him. Then she can be close and examine his tiny fingers and toes, stroke his cheek etc while you're still in control. Congrats on your bub!", "YTA.

If you're extra nervous maybe have her take the Red Cross Babysitting course, which has how to hold/feed babies and toddlers, what to watch out for, and it also includes infant, child, and adult First Aid and CPR. \n\nNAH you're just worried about your baby, the kiddo is just excited to meet her little brother, and MIL was rude by not respecting your boundaries but probably thought that she was making a compromise by planning to closely supervise Georgia.", "Its a dumb rule.\n\nThat doesnt make it ok for BFs mother to overrule you just because she doesnt agree. Thats an AH move. Assuming she knew... the story is kind of vague whether she was present when you told BF / BF told Georgia.\n\nAs far as the actual question, NAH. Its a great bonding moment for Georgia to be able to hold him, but its only been a week and your comfort & stress levels are also important. I think your concern is irrational, but taking a bit of time to work through it is also fine.\n\nQuick suggestion: Start by holding the baby together. As a 9 year old Georgia should be small enough that she can sit on your lap or next to you with your arm around her, where she can hold the baby with your arms under hers. She gets the experience, you get to work into it and get more comfortable with the idea, and you have full control the whole time.", "> She\u2019s a sweet girl and is excited to be a big sister.\n\nThat actually broke my heart.

They kept baby in a crib or car seat in a playpen where she couldn't even really see her, despite her being curious and wanting to interact. It continued for months, maybe even a year, that their daughter couldn't bond with her baby sister and only got to see her as someone who took her parents' attention from her.
