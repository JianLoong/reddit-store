This all began when my grandmother passed away, leaving a sizable inheritance for our family.\n\nAt first, everything seemed fine. My siblings (35F, 36M) and I (33F) started discussing how to distribute the inheritance fairly. But as the conversations went on, my siblings first suggested and then insisted that I should share my portion with them because they believed they needed it more than I did. The situation was intensified by the fact that one of their kids, Lily (3), has a heart condition, called \"Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis,\" requiring expensive treatments, including a specialized surgery that wasn't covered by insurance. They were struggling to cover these immense costs.\n\nWhat made matters even more complicated was that my other sibling, Sarah, had faced a series of unfortunate events, including a job loss and an unforeseen home repair disaster that drained her savings. She found herself in a dire financial situation. This added to the pressure on me to provide for them.\n\nI initially agreed to give them a small portion to help out with their child's medical bills and Sarah's financial troubles, but they kept pushing for more and more. Eventually, they wanted half of my inheritance, leaving me with just a fraction of what I initially received.\n\nFeeling pressured and overwhelmed, I stood my ground and said no. I worked hard for my own financial stability, and it didn't seem fair that I should give up so much of my inheritance, even with their child's condition and Sarah's financial woes in mind.

But first, ask if they signed up for financial aid at the hospital and if they have signed up for all the assistance they qualify for.  If you\u2019re in the US, some states offer Medicaid for kids with severe disabilities or cover kids at a higher income threshold than adults.  But, due to previous issues, my husband and I will only help directly pay bills for family members.  You tell me the baby needs clothes, not a problem, we head to the store and I keep the receipt.  That way the stuff can\u2019t be returned for cash.  You need help with rent?  Great, what\u2019s the landlord\u2019s number?  Turns out certain people don\u2019t want help that way, others are more than happy to follow our rules."]}
