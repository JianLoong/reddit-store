This all began when my grandmother passed away, leaving a sizable inheritance for our family.\n\nAt first, everything seemed fine. My siblings (35F, 36M) and I (33F) started discussing how to distribute the inheritance fairly. But as the conversations went on, my siblings first suggested and then insisted that I should share my portion with them because they believed they needed it more than I did. The situation was intensified by the fact that one of their kids, Lily (3), has a heart condition, called \"Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis,\" requiring expensive treatments, including a specialized surgery that wasn't covered by insurance. They were struggling to cover these immense costs.\n\nWhat made matters even more complicated was that my other sibling, Sarah, had faced a series of unfortunate events, including a job loss and an unforeseen home repair disaster that drained her savings. She found herself in a dire financial situation. This added to the pressure on me to provide for them.\n\nI initially agreed to give them a small portion to help out with their child's medical bills and Sarah's financial troubles, but they kept pushing for more and more. Eventually, they wanted half of my inheritance, leaving me with just a fraction of what I initially received.\n\nFeeling pressured and overwhelmed, I stood my ground and said no. I worked hard for my own financial stability, and it didn't seem fair that I should give up so much of my inheritance, even with their child's condition and Sarah's financial woes in mind. That's when things got ugly.\n\nIn a moment of frustration, I shouted, \"You're just a bunch of leeches! You've always been terrible with money, and now you're trying to suck me dry, just like you always do!\" \n\nI went a little far, and I\u2019ve apologized for being so harsh. But honestly even out of the heat of the moment I still basically feel the same way. I'd paid for their rent when they couldn't make ends meet, covered their credit card bills during a shopping spree they couldn't afford, and even lent them money to buy a car. Now, with Lily's condition and Sarah's financial struggles, they're making me feel like the bad guy for not giving them my inheritance. \n\nReddit, AITA for not wanting to share half my inheritance with my siblings, given their history? I'm honestly baffled by the situation and questioning if I've crossed a line that I can't come back from.", "created_utc": 1697339253, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17865la/aita_for_not_wanting_to_share_my_inheritance/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You've already found out they aren't grateful.  \n\nTheir greed is not your issue.  Their problems though awful are not yours to fix.  Who knows when you may need help,  will they be there? \n\n If not for the inheritance what would they have done?    They can figure themselves out. \n\nIf I was in their situation I would cry with gratitude if 100 bucks was offered.", "Before I met my wife, she had a similar story. Her grandmother left her house with my wife. Why? My wife was the only one who visited her, and took care of her. Her two sisters and brother never visited. So when the grandmother passed, my wife got the house. The siblings felt that she should have sold it and split the money. \n\nThe one thing that they didn't know was that there was still about $30k owed on the house. \n\nThis happened in 1993. Her brother never spoke to her again. He died a few years ago. Her 2 sisters hadn't spoken to her until I reached out to them. But even then, it was cold. She now has 1 sister left, and they rarey speak. \n\nNTA - The inheritance was left to you, and probably for a good reason.", "NTA and stop letting them leech of you, don't give them a single cent because they need to deal with the consequences.. tbh if they only reach out for money I don't think it's worth keeping contact.", "NTA OP.... I guess no good deed goes unpunished. You helped them earlier, even paying for their shopping spree, and now they think they are entitled to your money. Stop showing your love for them with money, not even a cent, not even on your nieces and nephews. You have earned your money. Spend it on yourself", "NTA.  Your grandmother could have had her estate rdoled out based on circumstances.  She did not.  Keep your entire inheritance.  It sounds like your siblings are using you as an ATM.  This is toxic.  Please see a therapist and develop some healthy boundaries that will allow you to help (or not) in a way that makes sense *for you*.", "Nta", "NTA, honestly 30 grand is not that much and before you know it, it will be gone. Stand your ground. What are they gonna do when your share is gone?", "Yeah, that was when we were a lot younger. I got a pretty good job while I was in college but my older sister jumped from job to job after high school. The shopping spree was when she decided she needed to do something in an office instead of food service and bought a bunch of clothes and shoes and stuff. If she\u2019d asked I would\u2019ve bought her an interview outfit but she racked up like $2k on a card. By the time she was asking for help paying it off it was long after the return period. She did get an office job but it still didn\u2019t pay enough for her to actually pay off the card and not just live hand to mouth.", "> \u201coh but don\u2019t you love us\u201d\n\nHow\u2019d you guess lol", "I don\u2019t have a family and so this would mostly be \u201cfun\u201d money for me. They keep saying things like do I really need a new TV and a third vacation when they\u2019re struggling to keep their lights on and their kids healthy. I think the inheritance they\u2019d get if we split it evenly is already pretty significant (about $30k each). But I guess they\u2019re both in a lot of debt.", "If you wanna help with the kids bills going forward, do it through the hospital or insurance, not the family for sure", "Gosh how sad all the way around. It\u2019s awful how money messes up families sometimes.", "No, we\u2019re pretty close as a family. We\u2019ve always lived near each other and have dinners together a few times per month. I love my nieces and nephews. It really sucks that this will definitely make things tense for a while.", "Their poor financial management is not your problem.", "Here's a thought OP:\n\nTally up all the rents covered, the credit cards paid off, etc etc.  Give them each their IOU's and say you want paid back for all the times you gave them money.  OUT OF THEIR INHERITANCE.\n\nTell them point blank they can either do the equal shares and walk away or they can pay you back out of their shares.  By the sounds of it, they will probably be forking over most, if not all of it, to you.\n\nAnd if they say anything about 'family' remind them that 'real family' doesn't treat one of their own like an ATM and nothing more.\n\nNTA.  NEVER.  You went above and beyond.  Now it's their turn to make a freaking effort.", "Do it through the hospital? How does that work? Can I just call a hospital about somebody else\u2019s bill? Do I need to have the bill?", "You can usually contact the hospital's billing department directly. They'll guide you on how to pay for someone else's bill.", "They just might not give you an itemized list. But you should be able to be like 'i wanna pay X on Patient ABC's bill' and theyll help. They want it paid, long as patient privacy is protected, theyll help you pay it."]}
