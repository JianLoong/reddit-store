The younger (S, 6M) has autism. S's communication is limited. His sensory needs and sensitivities can be hard on him, but we are learning to anticipate them and he's usually happy.\n\nWe recently took a last minute weekend trip to see an ailing family member. We check-in ~4pm to drop off our bags. Phone rings. Noise complaint from downstairs. Odd, but maybe in our hurry we'd been loud. I apologize.\n\n~9pm, S runs inside, gets into bed. Another call. \"If 2 seconds of footsteps are too much for the downstairs guest, we'd be happy to move rooms.\" None are available. Generic response about making the experience enjoyable for all guests. I remind family to walk softly and help me keep S off the floor.\n\n11:30 S wakes up and climbs into my bed. Another call. S screams. \"Are you serious? My son took 3 steps. You've sent him into a meltdown and woke my family.\" I ask him to please take note of my son's autism and not to call, and that I'd continue being more than reasonable. He says he understands but to respect guests with different noise expectations.\n\n6am S wakes up, I walk him to restroom. Phone rings. I tell them they can have earplugs or we can trade rooms, but I cannot be expected not to walk. I tell them do not call again unless they are giving me a new room or refunding my stay so I can go elsewhere.\n\nWe're out all day. That night S wakes up at midnight to get into my bed. I'm stroking his hair, he's dozing off again.\n\nPhone rings. S starts wailing inconsolably. I tell the man (colorfully) he might get more complaints now that he'd caused an autistic child to have a meltdown by failing to do his job. It took over an hour to calm S.\n\nFinal morning, idgaf anymore. I'm done. I let S run around. Phone rings. I ask for the manager. She isn't in yet. \"Call me when she is.\" Hang up. Phone rings. \"Is this the manager?\" No. Hang up. We finally check out. Manager won't be in for an hour. \"I'll wait.\"\n\nI introduce S. I explain the last few days. I told her I was disgusted her staff repeatedly failed to note my response to previous calls, failed to note S's disability, failed to determine an appropriate response to the downstairs guests. I reiterated we had not caused excessive noise until S had meltdowns in the middle of the night, caused by the incessant calls.\n\nI further explained that maybe I *should* have allowed S to run like I finally had that morning. He was probably more uncomfortable being forced to sit still than our neighbors would've been from hearing his footsteps, he just can't call to complain. Sitting still was already a tough compromise. Why did they think it was appropriate to harass my son, their guest? Didn't *his* comfort matter?\n\nShe cried, apologized, offered to comp the stay. I said \"It isn't about money. You really messed up our last visit with a dying relative by failing to train your staff.\" AITA?", "created_utc": 1672702227, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/101rdfi/aita_for_making_the_hotel_manager_cry_after_my/", "score": 188, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Perhaps the downstairs guests were over sensitive or perhaps your kid was louder than you think and you are downplaying it.  I suspect a bit of both.  The reason I say you might be downplaying how loud he was is because you mentioned way too many times here about him being autistic.  This makes me think you want some kind of special treatment or sympathy.\n\nSomebody who is trying to sleep doesn\u2019t care why a kid was making noise they just want it to stop.  \n\nNext time make sure you say you want a ground floor suite. Honestly hotels should give lower suites to people with kids or pets because this is a known problem. Or stay in an AirBnB.", "INFO:. Are you sure about the level of the noise? Because  oftentimes parents aren't aware that when they hear their little Liquid Jesus take three steps, what the neighbors downstairs hear is a herd of rabid hippos. And I'm not saying you or your kid ARE like that,  the weight with which you're leaning on your son's autism suggests to me that you might be. After all, by your own account, you used it as a bat to beat up the staff on not one,  not two, but at least four occasions.", "INFO\n\nAfter the first midnight phone call (or the first or second evening noise call), why didn\u2019t you just unplug the phone?

After making him wait around for an hour.

It comes across as sympathy baiting.", "YTA. There\u2019s no way you are telling the truth here. Hotels aren\u2019t perfectly quiet so if you\u2019re getting noise complaints there\u2019s more happening there.", "Info (kind of): did they complain/ call when another person was walking? Did they complain/call when you're absolutely sure that no one, especially your son, was walking? Cause I've gotten noise complaints before about, like, the TV being on, and I'm like, well it's not on, and I don't have anything else on, so idk. They must be hearing it from another room or something. But if they seem to complain only when your son is walking, and not at any other times, it's suffice to say you're under estimating how loud his steps are. How else would they be able to tell that he's walking, unless they had a secret camera or something set up in your room to spy on you?", "YTA. I worked at a hotel and part of policy was call/go to the room # where the complaint was issued. You arent TA for the other stuff, but making minimum wage workers cry is not cool", "ESH except the hotel staff. They are just doing their jobs. \n\nThe guests downstairs were AHs for constantly complaining about anything other than extreme noise. \n\nBut you\u2019re TA too because realistically, your son was probably loud. How else would the family be calling every time your son moved, but not when you or your other family members moved? They couldn\u2019t see you, so your son\u2019s movements must have been loud. Tiptoe-ing doesn\u2019t really eliminate noise for downstairs neighbors.\n\nI know you can\u2019t just make your autistic son be quieter. I absolutely empathize with that, and as someone who has worked closely with kiddos on the spectrum for a decade, I wish others would empathize too. In the future though, it\u2019s on you to make sure you get a ground floor. Other paying guests don\u2019t care about your son\u2019s disability in this dog-eat-dog world.", "YTA. If the downstairs people could hear your son walking but nobody else, then clearly he was being too loud. His autism has nothing to do with it. Any kid making too much noise in a hotel in the middle of the night is a huge nuisance. The hotel staff were just doing their jobs, they are responsible for making sure quiet hours are respected for other guests. You\u2019re lucky they didn\u2019t kick you out, most hotels would after 4 noise complaints. Berating the hotel staff for doing their jobs makes you a major AH, and the icing on the cake is using your son as a pawn to make them feel worse.", "YTA. I guarantee your kid was noisier than you are letting on. Autism doesn't give him a free pass to be loud and disturb other paying guests. How dare you make that lady cry so your brat can be entitled?", "YTA\n\nFirst, kids are noisy. Parents seem to not realize this and seem to have a built in tolerance. Kids are super noisy.\n\nSecond, you're at a hotel, people pay for a place to sleep there. You don't know the other person's story and they don't yours. You were ruining their sleep.\n\nThird, you chewed out the manager who basically just got there and probably knew nothing of the situation.\n\nAnd just for fun, I lived above a hotel, you can always hear when kids are moving around, something about the way they don't pick up their feet right, and again i lived above, can't imagine the noise below.", "I\u2019m going with NTA. When you stay in a hotel, some noise is expected. If you really got noise complaints because of footsteps, that\u2019s completely unreasonable. \n\nI once had to stay at a motel with my dog when we were moving. As we were going to sleep, the people in the room next to us decided to have aggressively loud sex which scared my dog. The loud grunting and and banging on the wall made him think that someone was trying to break through the wall. I didn\u2019t want my dog to bark at the sex and I especially didn\u2019t want to hear it so I took my dog for a walk around the block. When we got back, the noise was over and we went to sleep. \n\nPart of being away from home and sharing spaces with strangers means it\u2019s not always as quiet and perfect as home. I didn\u2019t call the front desk to make a noise complaint. I just accepted that this couple needed their romantic moment and dealt with it. \n\nIf my dog and I can deal with that, then the person below you can deal with footsteps.", "I think OP is full of shit. Why would they have not unplugged the phone? Sounds like a super simple fix especially if they have a child prone to meltdowns from loud noises. There\u2019s just something not ringing true here.", "Your kid is clearly A LOT louder than you think.  Stay in a cabin next time and don't put people through this.\n\nYTA", "YTA for making the manager cry for doing her job, which is calling you when she gets a complaint. Whatever your son is doing is causing a disturbance below every time he walks. I get it, I\u2019m a heavy walker too; the way my heel lands on the floor makes a thump whenever I walk that doesn\u2019t sound too bad in the same room but makes a ton of noise for people downstairs. Get your son some indoor slippers with a thicker sole to prevent future problems.", "How heavy are your son's footsteps!?  Something doesn't really add up. Also, what kind of hotel is this that you can hear footsteps above?", "ESH - Hotel staff sucks at their jobs. Then again, check out /r/antiwork they aint getting paid to put up with this crap. They're barely getting paid as it is.\n\nYou are TA for bring on a kid you cant control into a hotel setting. This isn't a sudden onset case of autism like the flu. YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS. But you chose to make it everyone's problem.", "NTA The guest downstairs had unreasonable expectations if your story is accurate. And constantly ringing tour phone was far from helpful/ Personally I'd have unplugged the phone.", "NTA\n\nHaving worked in hotels/motels before, you do get the occasional guest who will call and complain for the slightest hint that other people exist in the same building.\nSo I believe this could happen. \n\nAfter the first few, the staff should have sent someone to \"investigate\" themselves, i.e. stood near your room to gauge the sound, and offered to move one of you rooms. The 4pm, 9pm, and 6am calls should have tipped them off that this person was ridiculous, the complaints shouldn't have been passed along, and that a new room assignment needed to be prioritized to get this guest away from the other ones.\n\nI am guessing this was a budget hotel? In which case, front staff are really not the sharpest in the box. They're most likely working for less than $10 an hour, which does not attract the cream of the crop, especially on night or evening shifts, where they take whatevee they can get. Often at smaller places, after 3:30pm or so, the front desk person is literally the only one there, so they don't and won't do things that would require them to leave the front desk area, like go check out a noise complaint personally. (And they won't go knocking on doors without backup, because there is a high risk of them getting assaulted) Instead they'll revert to the most passive methods, like automatically calling and passing along messages, rather than using judgement to determine if it needs to be, or taking the extra effort to figure out how to contact you since you said no calls (note: you should have given them a cell number if you didn't want them calling the room phone. They should have been smart enough to ask, but hindsight and all that)\n\nIt's also very possible that they found the complaining guest (and/or you, given your gruff responses after the first day) annoying, and were using you as a method of getting back at them. We did stuff like that a lot: leaving the annoying guest near the loud group or elevator just because we didn't like them, and pretending there were no other rooms, or at least not going the extra effort required to make a new room happen.\n\nI do think this comes down to you being correct: it WAS the managers fault for poorly training her staff. She should have noticed the multitude of noise complaints and done something. Or empowered her staff to move you to a different room. Or something.\n\nNext time, I would advise going down to the front desk in the morning, which usually has the best staff on duty, and the manager is likely to be there around 8am or so. There is a lot more they are able to do for you in the morning than at night.", "Hi Op! Fellow mom of an autistic young man. \n\nNo NTA, as long as you didn't yell or curse at the manager. You were not allowing him to run around constantly after quiet hours, and yes, a certain level of living noise is expected in hotels. I would have absolutely complained. It also could have been the situation that made her cry, not just you. \n\nBut I do wonder if your son has been evaluated for impaired proprioception. Proprioception, also referred to as kinaesthesia, is the sense of self-movement, force, and body position.\n\nMy son has impaired prorioception, and it results in a heavy gait. For him, his gait gets heavier when he is tired or going through a growth spurt. We have never had a noise complaint in a hotel, but I can hear him every time he gets out of bed in his room. I don't notice it at all during the day, but it's absolutely something that wakes me up in the quiet at night. \n\nTo me, it would be a similar noise level to a person walking across the floor with crutches. It could be something that was less noticeable to you in the room than to the other people below you. \n\nEven knowing this, we have never gotten a noise complaint at a hotel.", "NTA, you're allowed to walk and the calling set off a meltdown. You should have unplugged the phone tho of it was possible. Save everyone some trouble.", "NTA, but the issue here seems less your son's autism and more the hotel's insulation or something - like you say, three steps shouldn't result in a noise complaint. I would have just unplugged the phone, and then told management the next day that you hadn't made any noise, and whoever was below you was delusional.", "NTA", "NTA - You are a great parent and the hotel staff are garbage humans. Also, every single one of you Y T A people are ableist bigots.", "Man, I was expecting this to be another ableist post when I saw autism mentioned at the start, but damn, good on you for fighting for your son's sensory needs. NTA at all! That hotel (hotel right?) really needs to look at their floor insulation or something because that was *ridiculous*. Poor kiddo.", "NTA.

I agree with the other comment that was made about requesting a ground floor when booking a room", "To be fair, I did repeatedly request a ground unit from their second call (was told none were available and downstairs guests weren't interested in trading).

He wasn't wearing his shoes. He was wearing socks. He ran the one time I mentioned in the post, but all other times he was just walking.

Believe me, it surprised me too.\n\nI'm struggling to understand how heavy he could possibly walk. He's 6. He wasn't wearing shoes. And they'd call because of literally just a few steps. As I said above, at least once I was walking right alongside him to help him in the restroom and it sure didn't seem like loud thunderous stomps, but it was apparently enough to hear through the floor?

Not a \"minimum wage employee.\" Maybe the manager has an autistic relative and would hate for them to be treated that way. Maybe the manager was empathetic to what Op was dealing with visiting a dying relative. \n\nCould Op be underestimating the amount of noise? Of course. But the fact that Op has used hotels multiple times in the past with no complaints. Tells me that the children are making a reasonable amount of noise. \n\nUnless you are staying at a high-end hotel with amazing soundproofing. Hotels are noisy. They are basically stacked bedrooms. A child getting out of bed and climbing into another one, even if he hopped across the floor to the next bed, should not trigger a complaint. \n\nAn autistic diagnosis does not equal a noisy child. I'm really surprised that so many people think that way. My son is autistic and outside of melt downs, (yeah those were bad) he was generally quieter than my other kids because noise, even his own, was too much stimulus. \n\nPart of an autism diagnosis can be impaired propreoception. Proprioception, also referred to as kinaesthesia, is the sense of self-movement, force, and body position. A result of this impairment can be a heavier gait. It's not stomping, it's still walking. But it's noticeable. My son has never triggered a noise complaint in any hotel. The noise would still be less than a person with crutches going to the bathroom.

Because I'm thinking one loud run across the room or a few loud successive stomps, I'm on alert. But it's going to take at least 2 or 3 to get me to call. That's because I know kids need reminders. Good parents will see a kid running around and tell them to be polite. If it happens repeatedly, the parent isn't doing it and they need someone else to remind them.

This needlessly ruined our entire evening and probably those around us. A note would have prevented that. Telling the guests downstairs that the phone call is what caused the screaming from the previous night would have prevented that. \n\n*I* was also a paying guest. They took no steps to verify the veracity of the claims made from downstairs. They made an already difficult trip (to see a dying relative) that much more difficult because we were all exhausted from being awoken by their ineffective protocol. Other paying guests likely had the same effect. That's poor customer service all the way around.\n\nWhy did I wait to speak to the manager? Because I sat down and thought about it. I can't blame employees for following bad protocol to the T. The protocol is the problem. Training staff to solve these problems more effectively is her job, not theirs.
