My brother, sister and sister-in-law were invited as witnesses, and me as the ring-bearer.\n\nI came over on the morning of the wedding to help set up everything, and my step-father was hosing down the veranda because we have chickens. He's the only one who knows how to use the pressure-sprayer, and he was ranting about how my mother and I were lazy for not learning how to use it and expecting him to be quicker (we were on a time crunch). I asked him what he'd be doing if he wasn't doing this, adding that he'd probably just be doing the jobs i was doing. He told me to shut my mouth and 'do your damn job' in a borderline yelling tone. For context, when he gets angry he begins to yell, stomp around, break shit and generally become a bit scary, a behavior he inherited from his father. I recently moved from their home to university accommodation, meaning I have the option of going 'home' if i don't feel like hanging around the house. I was also missing a two-hour lecture and a once-a-week tutorial so i could come to their house early to help them set up, something I was happy to do.\n\nIt was after he started yelling at me that I snapped. I just grabbed my stuff, said goodbye to my parents and drove away. They called me several times and my step-father was furious. I didn't have the rings or anything, they were just pissed I wasn't helping with setup.\n\nI came back for the actual ceremony a few hours later, but got dirty looks from my step-father and lesser looks from my mother. I was then excluded from lunch afterwards because I \"didn't help at all\" (Helped for 3/5 hours of the setup.)\n\nSo, AITA?  \n\n\nEDIT: I'd like to say this before this gets any bigger: I love my step-father. He helped raise me when my real father was absent, and he's one of the best men I know whenever he's calm. His anger is a product of the household he grew up in, but I know that's no excuse. I don't feel angry my mother is marrying him, I'm just angry at this moment.", "created_utc": 1678098902, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11jv93t/aita_for_leaving_my_parents_wedding_because_my/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

On one hand, I'm sure I made the overall setup for the wedding much harder via my absence for the last two hours. But on the other hand, I no longer have to tolerate my step-father's aggressive behavior. I believe I may have overreacted by leaving, but I simply felt I couldn't stick around while I was being screamed at when I was giving up my classes to be there.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I have a step father and he has never raised his voice at me or treated me the way your step father has. Everyone gets angry and frustrated but there is absolutely no excuse to degrade you or treat you the way he has no matter his upbringing. If my step dad spoke to me the way your step father spoke to you, my mother would immediately step in and put him in his place. Your step father needs to get his shit together and start treating people with respect. His upbringing is no excuse for bad behaviour.", "NTA", "NTA, get on with your life.
