I feel anxious in feminine clothes and just not  like myself at all. They ask me to be the bridesmaid and I initially  want to say no but then don\u00b4t want to be a disappointment so I give in. I  open up about my fears to my uncle and he promises I won\u00b4t have to wear  a dress during the wedding but would be allowed to wear a suit and tie.  When I get the package with my outfit in the mail, that Maddy sent to  all the bridesmaides, there\u00b4s a dress in there! I keep it a secret from  my Mom and just tell her they sent a suit as I had explained to her  before. I decide to not talk to my uncle about it anymore and just  borrow a suit from a friend of mine (we\u00b4re almost the same size and he\u00b4s  very supportive as well, thankfully.)\n\nThe  day my Mom and I attend the wedding, Maddy instantly takes me aside and  brings me to a private room and is furious for having \"disregarded her  wishes about the dresscode\". She yells at me aggressively and forces me  to undress in front of her and get in to a dress (she had extra dresses  on hand in aforementioned room.) I am frozen and shell shocked and not  able to say no. She walks away with my clothes (and phone, which was in  my pants) and I am stuck in a dress in that tiny room. I try to convince  myself to muster up the courage to walk out there but I just can\u00b4t.  After about an hour and no one looking for me, I start to panick. I am  so frightened that I start yelling for help. Apparently it\u00b4s right  before the ceremony is about to start and I unwillingly caused a HUGE  scene. My Mom and uncle figure out what\u00b4s happening and rush to help.  I\u00b4ve been told that I hyperventilated and passed out for a few moments  due to a massive panic attack. Once my uncle understands what happened,  he gets in to a massive, ugly fight with Maddy and the entire ceremony  is put on hold and the wedding is completeley ruined.

Ignoring it and just showing up in other attire carried a risk of causing disturbance, and that\u2019s exactly what happened.  \n\nNow, is the bride an AH if she has issues with how you dress?  Yes.  Was it fair to ignore and not discuss with her directly what you\u2019d wear for the wedding?  No.  Was she an AH for losing her mind?  Yeah, I\u2019m sure it could have been handled way better.  \n\nMy point is, YOU as you are is not the issue.  Dressing as a tomboy and not liking dresses are not the issue.  The issue was not addressing the point with the bride sooner likely made things worse than they could have been. \n\nGlad your uncle is reconsidering.", "INFO: Who has extra bridesmaid's dresses on hand at a wedding venue?", "I'm going to say NTA\n\nYou already talked to your uncle, he was good with it, Maddy went against his wishes for no good reason, and then forced you to undress which is really not ok. And obviously you cannot control a panic attack. He was very much in the right to blow up on her like that after learning what happen.\n\nHowever you really should have spoke to your uncle and mom the moment you got a dress in the mail and not kept it a secret. A fight would have been inevitable i think, but you could have avoided causing a massive scene at the wedding and avoided causing all that extra stress on yourself. Its not enough to say E S H, but that was a poor choice.", "This is complicated.\n\nNTA for not wanting to wear the dress but YTA for seeing the dress sent to you and not assuming something is up and talking with your uncle.\n\nHis fiancee sounds like an AH but the scene was avoidable.", "I get the anxiety part, but all of this could have been avoided if you had just told someone when the dress arrived.", "ESH. \n\nSorry but you shouldn\u2019t have kept the dress a secret then just show up in another outfit.  That could have all been avoided by telling your mom about the dress and telling your uncle.  You even went as far as to lie to your mom. Ignoring something doesn\u2019t make it go away.  \n\n\nMaddy is absolutely vile and her actions unforgivable. She clearly expected you to wear the dress she sent you and you offered no objections to when receiving it.  Her actions of \u201cforcing\u201d you to undress was psychotic.   \nWho even has extra dresses?  I read that and I actually asked myself if this is a troll post.  That\u2019s just insane.  \n\nIf I were you I\u2019d seen professional help for your anxiety.  No, you don\u2019t need to wear feminine clothing but you so easily bent to her wishes, undressing because she told you to, then sat there for an hour panicking instead of poking your head out the door and asking some passerby to find your mom or uncle.   That\u2019s not normal.  You\u2019ll get yourself into bad situations if you don\u2019t work on your ability to speak up (like with the dress,) tell someone no (like with undressing,) and keeping your head on straight instead of just sitting there and start screaming when you weren\u2019t even in a locked room.

Your uncle is the only one not losing his mind; their fight isn't about you, and it would have come out eventually anyway. Better before the wedding than after. \n\nYou're 21.

That woman sounds TERRIBLE.\n\nHaving said that, you may have saved this from getting out of control if you addressed it when you received the wrong clothing. As a person with insane anxiety (among other things), it took me a while to learn that not addressing things, confronting people, or generally postponing things I was anxious about oftentimes could make the situation even worse. I've learned to have a bit of forethought before I decide to speak or act (or NOT speak or act, should I say). It may save you a lot of worsening anxiety or panic attacks in the future. Hoping you are working through this with a therapist. \ud83d\ude42\n\nMaybe next time your uncle does get married to a hopefully GOOD person, a solution could be that you wear whatever you want and stand with others of like clothing? Brides\"maid\" and grooms\"man\" is so outdated anyway these days. If they're so worried about the aesthetic of the clothing they can just place their loved ones in the party according to those clothing aesthetics, it's as simple as that.\n\nEven better -- don't just say \"yes\" to make sure others aren't \"disappointed\". Make sure YOU'RE comfortable with what you're doing. You sound like you may be a \"people pleaser\" (like me) but you should realize that in doing so there's always one person that is CONSISTENTLY let down, and that's yourself.

It sounds like your anxiety prevented you from discussing it further but this just was not something for you blow off like that.

You for purposely going against the dress code that was set forth. You did it on purpose and you knew bride wasn't going to be happy. If you didn't want to wear the dress or adhere to the code set out. You shouldn't have stayed in the wedding party period. She should have just kicked you out honestly. You purposely to your mother.\n\nPeople weddings generally have codes especially for the bridal party. No one gives a crap if you're not happy. It's not your day, respect the theme or don't show up.

As an adult you should have mentioned the dress to him when you first got it because while Maddy was the one who sent it to you, it is also his wedding and he likely would have wanted you there in whatever you were comfortable wearing. I doubt the dress arrived only days before the wedding, so you had plenty of time to tell your mom or uncle that you got a dress when he said you could wear a suit. I'm not calling you a huge butthole because i see you as a victim in this, but you needed to take initiative to correct it yourself as a 21 year old woman who had the support of a family member who was the groom.\n\nMaddy was absolutely a butthole though, it is not ok to force someone to undress in front of you and it's not ok to take their belongings. You didn't ruin the wedding, she did by doing this to you. If they decide not to marry it is because of her actions changing her relationship with your uncle. \n\nMy question though is why did not one look for you for an hour? You were part of the wedding party that was supposed to be at the front of the crowd, and your mom and uncle were there.

I appreciate that a ton and this truly helps a lot <3", "Edit- \"I don't think she handled it well\" is a downplay. She was definitlely wrong for what she did to you. I undertsand the frustration and the anger, but I think the best case scenario would have been to just ask you to put it on and if you were reluctant than to just dismiss you from the wedding party.", "Her uncle had already given her permission to wear a suit.", "Agreed. A huge lack of communication and while I idnerstand if someone dosent want to wear certain clothing but then you just don't attend if communication dosent solve the issue.", "I understand your perspective and in hindsight I agree that I should\u00b4ve been less self-centered about the entire dress thing and talked to my Mom and uncle about it in time. \n\nAnd thank you for the kind words and reassurance.\n\nAs I\u00b4d been told later, when Maddy noticed that I wasn\u00b4t attending in time, she apparently had told my Mom and uncle that I had changed my mind and wanted to try on a dress but just \"needed a moment to myself\". She had explicitely asked my Mom and uncle not to look for me. Why she had done that, not sure. Maybe she got nervous after how she\u00b4d treated me, idk.", "thanks so much for your kind words of reassurance <3", "The uncle who blew up his entire wedding/relationship and probably lost thousands of dollars because he cares about his niece so much is not an asshole.", "A couple of things to be aware of.\n\nThere is NOTHING wrong with being a tomboy.  Nothing at all.  Plenty of us GenX folks have happily worn it for decades.  I grew up in jeans and t-shirts, and still prefer them to this day, and I'm over 50.  I've driven my mother nuts about it for decades.  \n\nNext, all the people saying, \"You are an adult\" need to be aware that the brain often does not fully mature until around 25.  Second, females are often expected to go along and get along.  I'm betting that was your mother's expectation.  \n\nYou'll learn to stand up for yourself over time.", "Holy fuck no WONDER she had a panic attack! Poor girl... That explains why she doesn't want to wear feminine clothes, too. Same thing happened to a friend of mine. She wore really cute, frilly stuff. After the assault, she wore baggy men's clothes for YEARS.", "Yes. Anxiety is a hell of a beast to deal with. \n\nSometimes you have to ask yourself \n\nA) does this have to be dealt with\n\nB) yes it does, can I put it off\n\nC) will putting it off make it worse or better. \n\nYou knew an issue would happen by wearing the suit. You made the situation worse, for everyone, by putting it off. \n\nMind you, Maddy is a massive asshole in this scenario. For ignoring your request to wear a suit, for stripping you in front of her, for taking your phone, for not checking on you and for a lot of things. She is 100% the biggest asshole in this whole story. \n\nBut if you had communicated then your Uncle and her could have argued it out, without you there, not a wedding and this would have avoided a lot. \n\nBut\u2026 it meant you had to force the issue, get past your anxiety and bring forward an argument you knew was going to happen. \n\nAnxiety is hard. But sometimes we have to have serious hard conversations with ourselves to work out what the best path is.", "He would be if he didn\u2019t communicate his permission for her to wear a suit in the first place.", "thanks so much for the encouragement and reassurance! <3"]}
