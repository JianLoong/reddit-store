I feel anxious in feminine clothes and just not  like myself at all. They ask me to be the bridesmaid and I initially  want to say no but then don\u00b4t want to be a disappointment so I give in. I  open up about my fears to my uncle and he promises I won\u00b4t have to wear  a dress during the wedding but would be allowed to wear a suit and tie.  When I get the package with my outfit in the mail, that Maddy sent to  all the bridesmaides, there\u00b4s a dress in there! I keep it a secret from  my Mom and just tell her they sent a suit as I had explained to her  before. I decide to not talk to my uncle about it anymore and just  borrow a suit from a friend of mine (we\u00b4re almost the same size and he\u00b4s  very supportive as well, thankfully.)\n\nThe  day my Mom and I attend the wedding, Maddy instantly takes me aside and  brings me to a private room and is furious for having \"disregarded her  wishes about the dresscode\". She yells at me aggressively and forces me  to undress in front of her and get in to a dress (she had extra dresses  on hand in aforementioned room.) I am frozen and shell shocked and not  able to say no. She walks away with my clothes (and phone, which was in  my pants) and I am stuck in a dress in that tiny room. I try to convince  myself to muster up the courage to walk out there but I just can\u00b4t.  After about an hour and no one looking for me, I start to panick. I am  so frightened that I start yelling for help. Apparently it\u00b4s right  before the ceremony is about to start and I unwillingly caused a HUGE  scene. My Mom and uncle figure out what\u00b4s happening and rush to help.  I\u00b4ve been told that I hyperventilated and passed out for a few moments  due to a massive panic attack. Once my uncle understands what happened,  he gets in to a massive, ugly fight with Maddy and the entire ceremony  is put on hold and the wedding is completeley ruined.

Ignoring it and just showing up in other attire carried a risk of causing disturbance, and that\u2019s exactly what happened.  \n\nNow, is the bride an AH if she has issues with how you dress?  Yes.  Was it fair to ignore and not discuss with her directly what you\u2019d wear for the wedding?  No.  Was she an AH for losing her mind?  Yeah, I\u2019m sure it could have been handled way better.  \n\nMy point is, YOU as you are is not the issue.  Dressing as a tomboy and not liking dresses are not the issue.

And obviously you cannot control a panic attack. He was very much in the right to blow up on her like that after learning what happen.\n\nHowever you really should have spoke to your uncle and mom the moment you got a dress in the mail and not kept it a secret. A fight would have been inevitable i think, but you could have avoided causing a massive scene at the wedding and avoided causing all that extra stress on yourself.

That could have all been avoided by telling your mom about the dress and telling your uncle.  You even went as far as to lie to your mom. Ignoring something doesn\u2019t make it go away.  \n\n\nMaddy is absolutely vile and her actions unforgivable. She clearly expected you to wear the dress she sent you and you offered no objections to when receiving it.  Her actions of \u201cforcing\u201d you to undress was psychotic.   \nWho even has extra dresses?  I read that and I actually asked myself if this is a troll post.  That\u2019s just insane.  \n\nIf I were you I\u2019d seen professional help for your anxiety.  No, you don\u2019t need to wear feminine clothing but you so easily bent to her wishes, undressing because she told you to, then sat there for an hour panicking instead of poking your head out the door and asking some passerby to find your mom or uncle.   That\u2019s not normal.  You\u2019ll get yourself into bad situations if you don\u2019t work on your ability to speak up (like with the dress,) tell someone no (like with undressing,) and keeping your head on straight instead of just sitting there and start screaming when you weren\u2019t even in a locked room.

Your uncle is the only one not losing his mind; their fight isn't about you, and it would have come out eventually anyway. Better before the wedding than after. \n\nYou're 21.

That woman sounds TERRIBLE.\n\nHaving said that, you may have saved this from getting out of control if you addressed it when you received the wrong clothing. As a person with insane anxiety (among other things), it took me a while to learn that not addressing things, confronting people, or generally postponing things I was anxious about oftentimes could make the situation even worse. I've learned to have a bit of forethought before I decide to speak or act (or NOT speak or act, should I say). It may save you a lot of worsening anxiety or panic attacks in the future. Hoping you are working through this with a therapist. \ud83d\ude42\n\nMaybe next time your uncle does get married to a hopefully GOOD person, a solution could be that you wear whatever you want and stand with others of like clothing? Brides\"maid\" and grooms\"man\" is so outdated anyway these days. If they're so worried about the aesthetic of the clothing they can just place their loved ones in the party according to those clothing aesthetics, it's as simple as that.\n\nEven better -- don't just say \"yes\" to make sure others aren't \"disappointed\". Make sure YOU'RE comfortable with what you're doing. You sound like you may be a \"people pleaser\" (like me) but you should realize that in doing so there's always one person that is CONSISTENTLY let down, and that's yourself.

It sounds like your anxiety prevented you from discussing it further but this just was not something for you blow off like that.

You for purposely going against the dress code that was set forth. You did it on purpose and you knew bride wasn't going to be happy. If you didn't want to wear the dress or adhere to the code set out. You shouldn't have stayed in the wedding party period. She should have just kicked you out honestly.

As an adult you should have mentioned the dress to him when you first got it because while Maddy was the one who sent it to you, it is also his wedding and he likely would have wanted you there in whatever you were comfortable wearing. I doubt the dress arrived only days before the wedding, so you had plenty of time to tell your mom or uncle that you got a dress when he said you could wear a suit. I'm not calling you a huge butthole because i see you as a victim in this, but you needed to take initiative to correct it yourself as a 21 year old woman who had the support of a family member who was the groom.\n\nMaddy was absolutely a butthole though, it is not ok to force someone to undress in front of you and it's not ok to take their belongings. You didn't ruin the wedding, she did by doing this to you. If they decide not to marry it is because of her actions changing her relationship with your uncle. \n\nMy question though is why did not one look for you for an hour?

I appreciate that a ton and this truly helps a lot <3", "Edit- \"I don't think she handled it well\" is a downplay. She was definitlely wrong for what she did to you. I undertsand the frustration and the anger, but I think the best case scenario would have been to just ask you to put it on and if you were reluctant than to just dismiss you from the wedding party.", "Her uncle had already given her permission to wear a suit.", "Agreed. A huge lack of communication and while I idnerstand if someone dosent want to wear certain clothing but then you just don't attend if communication dosent solve the issue.", "I understand your perspective and in hindsight I agree that I should\u00b4ve been less self-centered about the entire dress thing and talked to my Mom and uncle about it in time. \n\nAnd thank you for the kind words and reassurance.\n\nAs I\u00b4d been told later, when Maddy noticed that I wasn\u00b4t attending in time, she apparently had told my Mom and uncle that I had changed my mind and wanted to try on a dress but just \"needed a moment to myself\". She had explicitely asked my Mom and uncle not to look for me. Why she had done that, not sure. Maybe she got nervous after how she\u00b4d treated me, idk.", "thanks so much for your kind words of reassurance <3", "The uncle who blew up his entire wedding/relationship and probably lost thousands of dollars because he cares about his niece so much is not an asshole.", "A couple of things to be aware of.\n\nThere is NOTHING wrong with being a tomboy.  Nothing at all.  Plenty of us GenX folks have happily worn it for decades.  I grew up in jeans and t-shirts, and still prefer them to this day, and I'm over 50.  I've driven my mother nuts about it for decades.  \n\nNext, all the people saying, \"You are an adult\" need to be aware that the brain often does not fully mature until around 25.  Second, females are often expected to go along and get along.  I'm betting that was your mother's expectation.  \n\nYou'll learn to stand up for yourself over time.", "Holy fuck no WONDER she had a panic attack! Poor girl... That explains why she doesn't want to wear feminine clothes, too. Same thing happened to a friend of mine. She wore really cute, frilly stuff. After the assault, she wore baggy men's clothes for YEARS.", "Yes. Anxiety is a hell of a beast to deal with. \n\nSometimes you have to ask yourself \n\nA) does this have to be dealt with\n\nB) yes it does, can I put it off\n\nC) will putting it off make it worse or better. \n\nYou knew an issue would happen by wearing the suit. You made the situation worse, for everyone, by putting it off. \n\nMind you, Maddy is a massive asshole in this scenario. For ignoring your request to wear a suit, for stripping you in front of her, for taking your phone, for not checking on you and for a lot of things. She is 100% the biggest asshole in this whole story. \n\nBut if you had communicated then your Uncle and her could have argued it out, without you there, not a wedding and this would have avoided a lot. \n\nBut\u2026 it meant you had to force the issue, get past your anxiety and bring forward an argument you knew was going to happen. \n\nAnxiety is hard. But sometimes we have to have serious hard conversations with ourselves to work out what the best path is.", "He would be if he didn\u2019t communicate his permission for her to wear a suit in the first place.", "thanks so much for the encouragement and reassurance! <3", "ESH. Why would you not say something to anyone? Like you did decide to wear a suit after being gifted the dress and didn't tell anyone until the actual bride saw you minutes before the ceremony in which you are a bridesmaid. This could have been avoided much earlier and not ruin a wedding had you told literally anyone including the bride that you aren't wearing the dress.\n\nYou mishandled this so much that I can only think you intentionally tried to blindside the wedding party and didn't understand the kind of backlash you would recieve.\n\nYou're 21. What did you think would happen?", "YTA for knowing that a dress was sent to you and not speaking up about it and lying. That entire panic attack and drama could have been avoided if you had spoken up to begin with. Instead you lied so you didn't have to deal with any confrontation and look how that ended up. \n\nThat's not to say the bride isn't an ahole too - she is. But you kind of did this to yourself.", "NTA. Your timing could have been better, but your uncle found out just in time that he was about to marry a toxic bully, so you did a good deed.", "Nta", "NTA. You didn't ruin anything. Maddy just showed that she is rude, controlling and inconsiderate. If she can disregard you in such way, imagine what will she do to your uncle behind closed doors. However, don't shy away from expressing your thoughts and fear to your loved ones.", "YTA. When you agree to be a bridesmaid,  you agree to wear what the bride chooses....generally all the bridesmaids wear the same dresses. When you hot the dress you should have talked to Maddy about it and let her make the decision to let you wear a suit, or not be a bridesmaid. Brides put a shit ton if work and money into their wedding. Blindsiding her on her wedding day is not cool.", "It\u2019s totally fine to not want to wear the dress but definitely YTA for how you handled it. If you were literally sent a dress, what did you think was going to happen if you showed up in suit?! And it appears you really struggle with confrontation, which certainly doesn\u2019t make you an asshole, but then I don\u2019t get why you\u2019d pick an overly dramatic way of handling it. The thing to do would\u2019ve been to simply bow out of being in the wedding party.  I mean even just pretending to be sick and not going would\u2019ve been less dramatic than this?! Obviously the best way to handle it would\u2019ve been talking to your Uncle ahead of time, but clearly you know that and decided not to, soooo I\u2019m not really following.", "Soft and gentle YTA. \n\nSomeone else's wedding is not about you, especially someone as anal about getting stuff picture-perfect as Maddy. If you knew your mental health would be affected by wearing a dress, it would have been safer to cheerfully but firmly decline to be part of the bridesmaids. You could have joined your uncle's groomsmen/ people.", "Yeah how you did not reach out to your uncle when you got the package is beyond me.\n\nYTA", "Is today the day of the wedding attire controversy or something??", "NTA. Your uncle found out who Maddie is. Wouldn't blame him for having second thoughts. For everyone saying Y T A or E S H, remember that this is an anxiety prone young woman without much experience as an adult. Yes, she should have contacted uncle when the package arrived, but... now she knows that. Lesson learned.", "YTA - I mean if wearing a dress for a few hours causes OP to have a panic attack and pass out then she needs some professional help. It\u2019s just weird cause how hard is it to send a text clarifying that you will only wear a suit or just not being a bridesmaid? The bride is kinda a jerk but honestly OP is a 21 y/o woman. She needs to speak up for herself and not get wrapped up in some anxiety spiral where she has a massive panic attack right before the start of the wedding. \n\nKinda feel bad for the uncle. Like just communicate with people and this whole horrible situation would not have occurred. Also kinda feel bad for OP cause now her entire family probably finds her a bit off for causing this crazy scene at a massive wedding over wearing a bridesmaid dress.", "YTA\n\nYou agreed to be a bridesmaid. The bride expected you to wear a dress, which is not unreasonable. Instead of speaking to her about it, you spoke to your Uncle. He's not the bride.", "ESH. Sorry hun, but you could have spoken up, by text even at any time. \n\nWho knows what compromise you may have come to.\n\nWrite things down then you can edit what you need to say, then email it.\n\nThink of it as a learning experience.", "NTA\n\nAlthough you do totally suck for not communicating. You knew exactly the type of person she was, don't tell me for a second that you thought she would be ok with you showing up like that.\n\nIf that was all that happened, then you suck and we all go home.\n\nBut no, that wasn't all that happened. This crazy bride decides to commit assault, maybe even sexual assault with a dash of false imprisonment or something. Because no matter the context, no matter what you failed to do or how much you suck, SHE HAD NO RIGHT TO DO THAT TO YOU.\n\nYou did not ruin a wedding or a marriage. She did that. She showed who she was, and she was a person your uncle didn't like. You saved him from a crazy woman.\n\nGood luck to you. Talk next time.", "you need to learn to speak up for yourself better. you're 21 but avoiding difficult conversations/confrontation like you're a teenager. it's honestly pretty startling how incapable you seem of formulating words.", "Speak up Op, you now cost your uncle a wedding.", "NTA- there is no reason for an any adult to treat you this way. She can have a preference and decide not to have you in the wedding party but forcing you to undress and leaving you in the room,no, just no. Your uncle would be making a huge mistake marrying such a controlling asshole.", "NTA. You didn't ruin anything, you showed your awesome uncle who he could be marrying. If I was him and I heard this story, I would break that engagement so fast her head would spin. I would be asking myself how this would escalate in the future. And God forbid, if a child came through that was not how she envisioned. How would she treat them? \n\nIf you would feel better, you can go to your uncle and explain that you are sorry about what happened that day, and that you had tried to work around it. Not only that, but then you did your best when you were cornered and scared. \n\nI'm sorry you went through this, and I hope for the next gathering, you wear the clothes that make you feel the best. You don't have to conform to anyone's image of you but your own.", "NTA. You were put in a terrible position by Maddy and she is entirely in the wrong here. You should have spoken up before hand but I completely understand how that might have seemed impossible to do at the time. I'm so sorry this happened to you and I am so glad your family is supportive of you as you try to figure this all out. Please don't feel like you ruined something, your uncle is better off not marrying such a toxic woman.", "Not enough info.", "NTA", "ESH, except Uncle. You had a duty to speak up to your uncle well before the wedding. You could have handled that better. Bride sounds like hell.", "YTA, you did not have to be a bridesmaids. You could have said something when you got thr dress, you actively lied about the outfit to show up in a suit for no other reason to create drama. Then you Starr screaming for help, you were not locked in the room again. You could have just left if you did not want to be in the dress or even better not have put it on and just been a guest. Maddy may have been a bridezilla but you went out of your way to create maximum drama. I am guessing you don't like Maddy and wanted to ruin her big day.  If they work it out I think they should elope and you need to be honest with yourself as why you felt the need to act that way", "YTA. So you took the dress that was sent to you before the wedding and didn\u2019t bring up the issue with anyone and decided on your own you will borrow a suit from a friend to wear instead? That\u2019s a AH move, Now Maddy is an AH for disregarding your preference, (which she should have objected from the start if she only wanted bridesmaids in dresses)", "ESH you're the asshole for not speaking to anyone when you got the dress. At that point you have to either say something or suck it up and wear the dress to the wedding. Maddy sucks for obvious reasons.", "ESH. This could have been avoided if you hadn't concealed the dress and lied.\n\nI have anxiety. Big time. In the past, my anxiety would lead me to be so avoidant of issues that when they did come to a head, they'd go nuclear, just like this situation did \n\nYou need to get help to cope with your anxiety and learn strategy to address issues when they're still a molehill.", "Hard agree here, this is a greatly worded response.", "Yeah, OP kinda caused all of the problems she ran into. Literally everything was avoidable.", "I think a fair case could be argued for that and even false imprisonment. Definitely feels illegal.", "Except for the passing out part, this seems very familiar", "That is really scary to me. When someone's perfectionist nature starts hurting others, they need professional help. \n\nI would avoid Maddy at all costs from now on. I get the feeling the wedding isn't going to be a one-off.", "NTA I mean Maddy is the obvious villain here but  you should have told your mum and uncle as soon as the first dress arrived at your house.", "I'm going to guess the OP feels in a dress the same way I (M) would feel in a dress.   I think the only option the OP might have taken was to talk to the uncle before wearing a suit.\n\nI'm also sure that \"Maddie\" is a ogre for making you disrobe and switch clothing and then taking your clothing.", "Reworded bot repost of https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/105dqqa/aita_for_ruining_my_uncles_wedding_and_marriage/j3aecya/", "I'm glad to hear it. It's scary to face past trauma but facing it is the only way you can eventually control it, instead of it controlling you.\n\nYes, you should've told your uncle MUCH earlier (and I assume that's something you'll address in therapy) - but you should not blame yourself for their relationship breaking down. Maddy's treatment of you revealed parts of her personality and values that are probably dealbreakers for your uncle. Her insistence on traditional femininity for someone who simply doesn't fit that mold (AND feels extremely unwell when forced into it) isn't necessarily something that would've come up as clearly if it hadn't been for you - and if I were him I would (among many, many other feelings!) ultimately be very grateful that this made her show her true colors before they were married - and DEFINITELY before they had kids. \n\nSo whatever else you do, do NOT feel guilty for showing your uncle the real face of the person he was going to marry. Especially if he wants to have children, you've saved him (and any future kids) a lot of heartache down the road.", "*That\u2019s why I said* to seek professional help.  I see it every day, the strides that CAN and ARE made, when given the correct tools to help them whether they are alone or around people.   Whether it\u2019s PTSD, anxiety or a combination of different mental health issues, people can improve when finding the right provider for them.  Living like that isn\u2019t heathy.  It\u2019s not f\u2019n fun either. No one deserves to live like that.  The smallest \u201ctools\u201d can help head off panic attacks and they wouldn\u2019t have even had a panic attack of that magnitude had they been able to tell that crazy bitch \u201cno\u201d or if they could have confronted the dress-in-the-box prior to the wedding.\nDo panic attacks still happen?  Absolutely but most of those situations that triggered the attacks were preventable.  That doesn\u2019t even include how getting help will help them in their every day life.  \n\nReading comprehension is key.", "I understand that argument, but as someone who is a people pleaser, maybe OP was trying to solve the issue without making waves, hoping to just slide under the radar. Or maybe they chalked it up to a mistake. I probably would have done the same thing since the problem was addressed 2x before and uncle said it was fine to wear a suit. Then again, I don't have a shiny strong spine.", "Maybe so but OP is young and clearly dealing with some pretty big mental health issues that she\u2019s starting therapy for so I can understand why she avoided the issue rather than confronting it. I hope she can get some help and find peace so she can stand up for herself in the future.", "I thought it sounded a bit familiar.", "Where I am to get professional help it might take 6-12 months or even more on a wait list before you get seen by a psychologist.", "You are not listening. That is what the bride did to her that day. The bride took her clothes off her and took them away, as well as her phone. That's what caused the panic attack...", "I wouldn't be surprised if he did and Maddy bulldozed over him or (more likely) went behind his back.", "Which is a major crisis that should not be taken lightly.\n\nBut it\u2019s better to get started by getting yourself on a waitlist than to just ignore the problem.", "OP was told to undress by an unarmed woman. They had the power to say 'no' and walk out. They had the power to say 'no' at any point, and to talk to Mom and Uncle when the dress showed up. They did not use their voice or their autonomy at any point, and the day of, it was because of anxiety. \n\nThey need treatment for that. \n\nI disagree that being asked to undress and hand over a phone count as sexual assault and theft. Any power imbalance was negligible, and help was *at* the venue.", "Ooooooohhhhh I misread that, my bad.", "An adult in a position of perceived authority told a scared young woman to undress. They stood and watched and refused to let the child leave until they did so and then took the woman's property including her only means of contacting help.\n\nIf you think that situation is okay you need serious help and I hope you don't have children.", "I disagree. People with anxiety cannot help it, and forcibly telling someone to undress and give them their belongings absolutely is SA and theft. Who knows what could have happened if she \u201csaid no and left\u201d when this random woman is already acting so hostile over a fucking dress?", "Ehm... yes, someone forcing you to undress when it clearly makes you uncomfortable is sexual assault. It doesn't matter if the force is physical or psychological. She was forced and her clothes and phone were stolen. Bride ruined her own wedding by being a psycho.", "OP is 21, hardly a child. \n\nI never said what happened was ok, just that OP's anxiety kept them from the regular adult reaction of 'No' and walking out. I said OP needed help with their anxiety because it made them easy to overpower. It convinced them that they had no choice, when in reality: there was no threat of violence or social repercussions, they were sober, fully-clothed, and with a working phone, mere feet from an unlocked door to multiple safe loved ones. They don't *have* to live with anxiety like that. \n\nAnd I say this as a short woman whose 'no' has been ignored, so I completely understand power imbalance and freezing.", "Psychological forcing?! For an obnoxious request of an adult in a venue with loved ones? \ud83d\ude02\n\nNah, it was rude af, total asshole, but OP should have been able to just walk out. Their anxiety stopped them from being able to do what any basic adult should be able to.", "Read the text. You sound like the type of person who thinks a woman isn't raped if she falls into the freeze option of fight, flight or freeze. \n\nJust fyi: that would be rape. Freezing isn't consent.", "It\u2019s called coercion."]}
