We used to be very cordial, until the son got older. The wife/mother was always kept in check by her daughter or father. During 2020, her father died from COVID, and her daughter got married and moved away. Ever since then, she\u2019s been bothering me and my neighbors. She\u2019s very bitter and jealous. \n\nMy previous neighbors have even moved because of her behavior. She and her family will constantly sit in their garage and watch people. Recently, she\u2019s been bothering me since I\u2019m the only old neighbor left in the area. When I get my mail or throw out my trash, her or her son will come out of their garage and watch me to annoy me. They\u2019ll also honk their horn in front of my house, and get their friends to honk in front of my house too. When I walk my dog, they\u2019ll drive up behind me. I always thought it was coincidental, until I realized it was intentional to bother & harass my family and me. They always sit and watch people in their garage.\n\nA few years ago the mother was recording my family & me cleaning the snow from her phone. We stopped speaking to them completely at that point.\n\nRecently, a few months back, when I went to get my mail. As I went back inside my home, my neighbor\u2019s son screamed \u201cF*** YOU\u201d and it was caught on my Ring. His father was in the garage too when he said it. So clearly, his parents don\u2019t even reprimand him. I alerted the police and they spoke to the son; that stopped them from saying anything. They promised they would stay away, but now they do petty things to bother me and my family when we step out of our home, simply because they are pissed we called the police on their son when he screamed f-you at me. \n\nI have anxiety and mental distress. I have stopped walking my dog to avoid them, and have my Mom accompany to get me the mail. The court suggested mediation because I felt terrible filing charges. I decided to go for mediation, but cancelled it because I did not want to speak with them. They stopped briefly after I filed for mediation, but  they re-started after it was cancelled. These people don\u2019t seem to stop forever. They do petty things that aren\u2019t illegal, but I feel insanely harassed (watching me, honking horn, coming out same time when I get mail/throw garbage). \n\nThe worst part of it all, is that the son\u2019s mother supports him because she\u2019s jealous and bitter. Part of me feels bad for filing because they\u2019re my neighbors, and the son is young (21). I am 25, not much older, but yet feel I deserve to live in peace.\n\nAITA for filing harassment charges against the son?

I filed harassment charges with my town\u2019s court. \n\n2. feel like ITAH because they\u2019re my neighbors and because the son is younger than me, but yet, his mother supports his behavior, and he\u2019s still old enough to know better.

Always slowly down to get a good look at me.  I mean, I'm mowing my lawn, what are looking at?  They do the same to other people.  It's not illegal, they're just circling a block they don't live on.\n\nI had friends come out to help rehang my door and here come the cars.  It's very nerve wracking and done to intimidate.\n\nI had to threaten to get the prosecuting attorney involved.  His nephew was one of the guys helping me.", "NTA and you should file more charges. Before you do, focus your Ring on their garage. Go out and get footage of them coming out as soon as you do. Then, find someone to go outside for you to confront them, on the Ring (I assume you can capture audio) and have that person ask them why they feel the need to harass you (again I assume you can't do this yourself due to your anxiety. Have that person tell the family to stop. Save any response. Continue to gather information, then compile it and bring it to the police.

That definitely sounds similar to my situation: bothering without trespassing or saying anything directly. My best advice is to file a police incident report of the incident. Let them know. You don\u2019t have to file a formal complaint, but keeping a record with a police report will help the police, incase others complain. \n\nThere\u2019s more of you guys than them. Maybe the police will reprimand them if you all complain together. I would also advise placing a \u201cThis property is under surveillance\u201d sign, or put up a real/fake camera on your property to maybe scare them a little. Save all the footage of them coming out the same time you do as well. Best of wishes!", "So the mother is always walking her dog on my property. Not sure if that\u2019s trespassing, but yes, hopefully everything they\u2019ve done altogether maybe will show they have intentions to harass.

They literally sit in their garage and people-watch 24/7. I don\u2019t even need to worry about crime because they\u2019re watching everyone all the time. Sadly, not in a position to move, plus, don\u2019t want them thinking they scared away another neighbor. Thanks, for the validation!", "YTA for not fully reading the whole post.

Doctor says it's stress related to my asshole neighbors constantly harassing me for decades.  Family still refuses to move, and I'm not in the best situation to move at this time.  Besides, even if it kills me (and it might) I will NOT give those assholes the satisfaction of chasing me away from my home.\n\nHopefully, the neighbors move soon.  They've already been living there decades.  So if I can only be patient for another couple of decades, MAYBE I'll get lucky and they will go somewhere else....\n\nDo you get my point?  There is no way you win in this.  Well, it's possible that a tactical nuke launched by North Korea goes off-course and lands in your neighbor's living room but strangely does not hurt anything in the neighborhood other than vaporizing one single parcel of land.  \n\nBut other than that?  You don't win.  You just find the best way to cut your losses.  I suggest you do it soon.  Stress is a killer.   Literally.  Better to let the assholes \"win\" as long as you can get back to a normal routine without them.", "Keep us updated please", "You're right.  But then there's Birds of a Feather....", "Moving is clearly the best option to stop the harassment, but it isn't something OP is able to do.\n\nDo you have any idea how shitty the housing market has gotten? Prices are ridiculously higher than only a few years ago and interest rates are much higher as well. OP might have a decent house that she can afford but I'd be willing to bet that trying to move into a similar house somewhere else would be a shitload more expensive not even including the moving costs. She would probably have to downsize, significantly.\n\nI say this as a person that's getting divorced and having to move out and even with a roommate or new partner I can't afford anything even close to what my home would cost now compared to when we purchased it in 2019. My own home is valued at 100k more than when we bought it. Like I'm literally going to live in a friend's basement for a year without even a full kitchen just so I can save money to maybe get a shitty little house in the future. \n\nHaving a shitty neighbor sucks a whole lot but not having affordable housing causes a fuckload of stress. Likely more than a shitty neighbor, IMO."]}
