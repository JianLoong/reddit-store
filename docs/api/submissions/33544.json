Kate is a nerdy and intelligent person; she has a PhD and works as a college professor. Whenever she's not working, she's always researching about the 60s and knows a lot about that period. My own mother was born in the 60s and even Kate knows more than her. \n\nPersonally, her obsession is cute. Whenever she talks about the '60s, I've noticed she's always happy, and she smiles, and it just makes me happy that she's happy. This year, after being in a relationship for three years, Kate and I decided to move in together, and we've decided that we're having a Christmas party. \n\nThis is where I may be the asshole. Back in November, I got back in touch with a friend whom I hadn't seen for ages due to our schedules constantly clashing, and we finally had a date where we could both meet up for some coffee. During our meeting up we were asking about each other's family and he asked how Kate was. I explained Kate was doing well, she was promoted at work and to celebrate I'm taking Kate and her friends on a surprise night out to celebrate her promotion as I'm proud of her. We kept talking back and forth about each other's partner and I mentioned Kate is working on a new project at work and it involves two other colleges collaborating so she's really pleased with that. I also stated Kate is doing a research project about the 60s in her own time so she's really busy. This friend of mine was already invited to our Christmas party well in advance and most of the comments he made were nasty and would probably get me banned so the \"nicer\" comments he made included \"she's such as a weirdo\" \"I'm personally surprised she's even in a relationship considering the fact she's a nerd.\" \"Her obsession is so weird it's amazing she's still has friends\". I don't know why he made these comments but he said these once we finished speaking about our partners. I got angry and left; he had to pay the bill.\n\nA few hours later I calmed down and informed Kate I'm uninviting a friend of ours to the Christmas party. She asked why and I explained. She said she isn't bothered about what he said and he can still come but I remained adamant that he's not coming to the Christmas party at all. I sent him a message on Messenger explaining that I have uninvited him to our Christmas party because of the rude comments he made to my girlfriend. We've got into a heated exchange then I didn't hear from him for a day. I found out he messaged some mutual friends and they think I'm being a little OTT.\n\nSo, am I the ahole?", "created_utc": 1703239427, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18obk79/aita_for_uninviting_my_friend_to_a_christmas/", "score": 220, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think I take a different tack to most on this sub -- for me, the supporting characters aren't as important as the OPs. According to the words of the OPs here, they are surrounded by obvious assholes like this old friend. Let's presume they're right. One sided, big if, but whatever.\n\nIt remains that the OPs are worried if *they* are the assholes. There being other assholes present isn't relevant unless the real question is \"do I have an excuse to be an asshole here\"?\n\nWho knows how well OP handled that message exchange! I'd find it weird to be approached after a gaff with a disinvitation rather than another conversation.\n\nOP shouldn't have pushed on, it would have been better to take Kate's lead and be cool.

Sounds like you both are!", "NTA, you're standing up for your partner. A lot of people would have not only kept the invitation but joined in; I've never understood why people bash their partners and allow/encourage others to do the same.", "NTA.  You did right by defending your girlfriend.", "NTA - and why hang out with someone whose company you don't enjoy? FWIW- it sounds like he is carrying a torch for you, and you pretty much smithereened it with your joyful and generous discussion of your wife's interests .

There's nothing wrong with that. This \"friend\" isn't worth your time or concern if he's going to continue being criticising Kate or anyone else.", "NTA\n\nI'll recomend checking out the term neurodivergent (ND) and even joining some communities. I'm autistic and we use the phrase \"special interests\" to refer to \"obsessions\" we have.\n\nEven if you or your SO aren't ND, you'll find people very passionate about very specific topics that love talking about them, and even listening to others about their interests.\n\nMine is Storytelling. Any medium that tells a story fascinates me. But most of my focus is in worldbuilding.", "NTA \n\nYou could say this isn\u2019t so much about the comments about Kate but more so his tendency to make a huge, rude, unkind scene about people. Can\u2019t have that at a party.", "My wife is my partner and anyone who insults her would be instantly checked by me and if they didnt apologize or doubled down then i would leave like you did and move on without that friend in my life.

Good for you!", "Well, you got more than a glimpse of how he feels about your gf.  NTA.  He clearly doesn't like your gf for no good reason & made himself clear about that.  Uninviting him is the right thing to do.  Regardless if your gf isn't bothered by it, itt clearly bothered you & why would you want to hang out with someone who speaks of your gf that way?", "NTA\n\nDon't allow unkind people in your life because you want to be a good person. Bad people manipulate other people's desire to be decent to get away with their nastiness.\n\nConsider how valuable your emotional energy is and conserve it for those that deserve it.\n\nYour gf sounds amazing and I would personally love to meet her at a party and talk to her about the 60s. Maybe while sipping a grasshopper? Lol", "NTA at all, your GF has a special interest that brings her joy to research and talk about, it's not just an 'obsession'.

Nerds are cute\u2026 Don\u2019t know why friend had a stick up about it. Regardless of what you said in \u201cwe had a heated exchange\u201d (I\u2019m sure it\u2019s probably long and messy otherwise we\u2019d know), I\u2019m with you OP.

He needs a diary, stat.", "Rephrase \"obsession\" to \"expert\" she is an expert of the 1960s. \n\nI'm not an obsessed Harry Potter fan, I'm a Harry Potter Scholar/Expert", "NTA - take the trash out.  Anyone who disrespects your partner can find a different party to attend.  The friend sounds SUPER toxic.  Stand your ground.", "Why would OP want to spend time with such a killjoy generally?  I don't have any friends who would just go ahead and be nasty about someone's harmless interest for no apparent reason.", "I'm on the autism spectrum and immediately thought of this as well.", "I disagree about it being over the top. OP's comfort matters too, and this guy was insulting both someone she loves and their relationship. Even if Kate would be comfortable with him being there, that doesn't change whether or not OP is comfortable with it.", "Maybe bc OP is the one who was exposed to his behavior? Does it not make sense to you that OP would no longer want to be friends/have someone at her house who is capable of saying such awful things unprompted?", "OP had her GF's back. Maybe Kate can afford to be magnanimous but OP cant as this person has no inclination of changing their attitude. So let me also return the comments back at the friend which fits them to a Tee \"HE's such as a weirdo\" \"I'm personally surprised HE's even in a relationship considering the fact HE's is a TA.\" \"His obsession is so weird it's amazing HE still has friends\"", "Thank-you!\n\nWas over-tired and somehow stuffed that up.\n\nHave corrected the pronouns, and gendered nouns.", "Thank you, it wasn't just me then", "Exactly. And moreover, this person was OP's friend, not Kate's. It makes total sense for OP to see his true colours and choose to end their friendship, which would result in not having him over for Christmas. Even outside of defending her gf, who wants to surround themselves with that kind of negativity and cruelty? Plus, if he did come to the party, eith his attitude, who knew what he would have said about Kate and/or the other guests? He likely would have ruined the mood or made ppl feel uncomfortable.", "yeah, no problem. I do agree with you on everything, OP is right in every way", "While I agree with you that I often differ from the popular takes here, (and that the takes can be extreme) I don\u2019t think the info we have can deem OP the asshole, and definitely by the friend\u2019s reaction I would confirm they are NTA. \n\nOP doesn\u2019t mention if he communicated that he didn\u2019t like his friends comments, but if they just stormed off without communicating, that\u2019s an A H move and E S H. Even then, given that op says they\u2019re only listing the \u201cnicer\u201d comments the other party made, it\u2019s reasonable to assume worse was said and OP may have had excellent reason to storm off without explanation- if they indeed did. \n\nThey specify in their post that they messaged their friend after they had calmed down and in telling the friend they weren\u2019t invited, friend got upset, and dragged others into their disagreement. For this point, OP is absolutely NTA. They calmly expressed their upset, the reason for it and the outcome, and the friend in question escalated the issue. That makes friend A H, and definitely not OP.\n\nI do agree with you that there are often cases within this sub that can be resolved and don\u2019t necessitate the \u201cNC BLOCK THEM FOREVER\u201d they often get- in this instance I personally would remove the offending \u201cfriend\u201d from my life. If I explain to someone that I\u2019m upset, and they double down, refuse to apologize and then drag others into it: that\u2019s not someone I want to associate with, at least not for a good while. Even then, they\u2019d have to come around of their own volition with remorse for me to consider it. \n\nTLDR; by your own admission we don\u2019t know if OP handled it as well as they say they did- but if they are genuinely seeking out an \u201cAITA\u201d in good faith and provide accurate information, in this case we would have to say op is NTA. Typically with self service posts that are not in good faith, we see more character defamation of the other party, alongside more defensive/ manipulating statements accounting for their own behaviour. I don\u2019t strongly see that in this post, and it reads in good faith that if OP were the A H it sounds like they\u2019d fix it.", "I still appreciate the catch \ud83d\ude0a\n\nI can't _believe_ I made that mistake!", "Like I suggested, the friend sounds like an asshole, I'm not saying otherwise. But I said I thought that wasn't relevant.\n\nOP doesn't say she calmly expressed her upset -- she calmed down (to a state of angry-calm we must presume, as the wish to disinvite remained) and then messaged the friend. There wasn't a jolly way to start this exchange and we can presume it hit hard at the other end.\n\nI don't need OP to be lying here, or misrepresenting anything --  calling to disinvite somebody because of offense they caused, which the subject of the insults doesn't feel, is a bit of a weird thing to do with a friend imo. OP looks oversensitive about her \"weird\" girlfriend -- people seem to struggle to laugh things off here and I wonder how many long term friendships we are supposed to have if we can't get over rum remarks like the ones related here.", "Just bc the gf wasn't upset doesn't mean OP doesn't have a right to be. Defending her gf isn't the only reason she has to disinvite the guy-she herself was subject to his bad behavior. Whether he was talking about her gf or some random stranger, it's pretty notmal to feel disgusted by a supposed friend who reveals that they can easily say awful things about another person for no reason. They guy was acting like a bully-why would anyone want someone like that at their Christmas party?"]}
