{"id": 33544, "submission_id": "18obk79", "title": "AITA, for uninviting my friend to a Christmas party my girlfriend and I are holding after he was rude about my girlfriend's obsession?", "selftext": "I (30F) think obsessions are normal, and my girlfriend (35F) has one. \"Kate's\" obsession has to do with the '60s. Kate is a nerdy and intelligent person; she has a PhD and works as a college professor. Whenever she's not working, she's always researching about the 60s and knows a lot about that period. My own mother was born in the 60s and even Kate knows more than her. \n\nPersonally, her obsession is cute. Whenever she talks about the '60s, I've noticed she's always happy, and she smiles, and it just makes me happy that she's happy. This year, after being in a relationship for three years, Kate and I decided to move in together, and we've decided that we're having a Christmas party. \n\nThis is where I may be the asshole. Back in November, I got back in touch with a friend whom I hadn't seen for ages due to our schedules constantly clashing, and we finally had a date where we could both meet up for some coffee. During our meeting up we were asking about each other's family and he asked how Kate was. I explained Kate was doing well, she was promoted at work and to celebrate I'm taking Kate and her friends on a surprise night out to celebrate her promotion as I'm proud of her. We kept talking back and forth about each other's partner and I mentioned Kate is working on a new project at work and it involves two other colleges collaborating so she's really pleased with that. I also stated Kate is doing a research project about the 60s in her own time so she's really busy. This friend of mine was already invited to our Christmas party well in advance and most of the comments he made were nasty and would probably get me banned so the \"nicer\" comments he made included \"she's such as a weirdo\" \"I'm personally surprised she's even in a relationship considering the fact she's a nerd.\" \"Her obsession is so weird it's amazing she's still has friends\". I don't know why he made these comments but he said these once we finished speaking about our partners. I got angry and left; he had to pay the bill.\n\nA few hours later I calmed down and informed Kate I'm uninviting a friend of ours to the Christmas party. She asked why and I explained. She said she isn't bothered about what he said and he can still come but I remained adamant that he's not coming to the Christmas party at all. I sent him a message on Messenger explaining that I have uninvited him to our Christmas party because of the rude comments he made to my girlfriend. We've got into a heated exchange then I didn't hear from him for a day. I found out he messaged some mutual friends and they think I'm being a little OTT.\n\nSo, am I the ahole?", "created_utc": 1703239427, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18obk79/aita_for_uninviting_my_friend_to_a_christmas/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was not just one rude comment, which could have - maybe - been a slip of the tongue. It was many, and they were mean and severe. Why would you want to spend time with someone who views your partner that way? It is large of Kate to let it slide, but I'd stand my ground.", "NTA. He said horrible things about your awesome girlfriend, of course he can't come to your party.", "NTA.\n\nIn fact, sir, you are a bit of a legend.\n\nYou didn't once complain about her, thereby (to some people's minds) inviting support of your criticism.\n\nThis 'friend' hurled a torrent of mean spirited, unkind, abuse at the woman you love.\n\nYou defended her and called him on it - not to gain 'brownie points' (because she wasn't there,) but because you were right, and he was horrible, and left.\n\nAND followed through by uninviting him.\n\nLegend.\n\nKate is a star for not being bothered, but you certainly would be, knowing the vitriol this guy spews.\n\nAs for the mutual friends - find out what he told them, then educate them.

Every couple should have each other's back. But judging based off the \"nice\" comments he made, how were you friends in the first place?", "NTA", "NTA. I would uninvite this person from my life. If anyone talked that way about anyone I cared about, they'd be swiftly shown the door.", "NTA, but if your gf isn\u2019t bothered, your reaction is a little over the top. Some of us don\u2019t mind being the weirdo and maybe she would\u2019ve had fun being even more weird to annoy him at the party! The defensiveness is cute, but you should tone it down to what gf is comfortable with!", "NTA. Denigrating your girlfriend is extremely rude and shows he lacks social skills.", "NTA. Also, whoever thinks that being nerd is a bad thing should be banned from society because having cultural and even weird hobbies is what makes people interesting", "NTA - If he was your friend he wouldn't be insulting your girlfriend.\n\nA party costs money. Don't spend money on this person.", "NTA, i salute you", "NTA. Maybe your reaction is a little OTT since your gf said she's not bothered, but the thing is, this is how the bullshit starts and it escalates from there. Nipping it in the bud now is the smart thing to do.

It sounds like his presence at your party would make YOU uncomfortable, and that alone is reason enough to uninvite him. You sound like a very loyal partner, and I hope your gf appreciates that. \n\nI wasn't going to say this but might aa well. You \"friend\" sounds jealous, and I wonder if he might be attracted to her, using comments about her to cause you doubts.", "Kate sounds cool, I'd roll with her instincts to let your friend's words wash off. Her response is very likeable.\n\nCareless words come out of mouths sometimes (careless cos they aren't really believed OR cos they are and we meant to hide em). Yeah your friend was rude and maybe calling her outburst carless is too generous. But who knows where her uh complex over this comes from. We need to leave each other room to get over what we say. No harm here cos Kate DGAF.\n\nI think you'd be a bit of an asshole for fromalising/crystallising your tiff over coffee into a Real Thing on the calendar. You made your point & left the bill to be picked up like on TV. Very fun.

I think I take a different tack to most on this sub -- for me, the supporting characters aren't as important as the OPs. According to the words of the OPs here, they are surrounded by obvious assholes like this old friend. Let's presume they're right. One sided, big if, but whatever.\n\nIt remains that the OPs are worried if *they* are the assholes. There being other assholes present isn't relevant unless the real question is \"do I have an excuse to be an asshole here\"?\n\nWho knows how well OP handled that message exchange! I'd find it weird to be approached after a gaff with a disinvitation rather than another conversation.\n\nOP shouldn't have pushed on, it would have been better to take Kate's lead and be cool. But of course the main take on this sub will be CUT EM OFF, followed by DON'T BE A DOORMAT -- this thinking is a bit extreme to me :D"]}
