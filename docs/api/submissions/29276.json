He was 8k in debt for whatever reason and if it' sjust from vaping then you have a major issue. regardless you establish a budget and financing to I presume include paying down that debt. You think he changed but in reality he's been begging the difference from every friend, family member and anyone else he could. So instead of spending lets say 500 a month, he's been begging the extra from friends. So he's pushed his friends/family to make up the difference, they cut him off and he went straight to dog food money. So he didn't change, he just displaced how he paid for the vapes for a bit.\n\nNot entirely sure where the budget or allowance comes from, does he not work or make so much less than you that you are allocating all this money? if he's working he's just playing along but taking what money he needs anyway.
