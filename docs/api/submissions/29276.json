You will be fully TA as well to yourself if you don\u2019t realize that this guy is incredibly immature, remorseless, and will use you just like he uses them", "How on earth do people spend more than $150 on DOGS.", "This! OP, do you really think his behavior is marriage material?", "NTA but you are both financially incompatible. I would not live with someone that wasted and stole money.", "NTA\n\nIn the process of quitting, again.  Back to vaping to break the damn habit.\n\nIt's sorta worked a few times.  Hard thing is I try to quit to save money, not because I care about my health much.\n\nHaving said that, I can remember eating plain oatmeal and going without cigarettes to make certain I could buy my dogglette food and treats and stuff.", "He's stealing and (probably) lying to his family to fund his habit. Another sign that this is no longer a habit, but a full-blown addiction.", "Yeah honestly that sounds more likely to me", "Softly YTA to yourself if you give him access to any of your funds. \n\nSplit them, you be in charge of dog money/bills/your own spending and leave him to his own finances. You won't be waiting long until his true colours come out, the 8k of debt was your first warning, then the taking money from his parents etc was a big red flag.\n\nSeriously think about your future on this one, you cant force somebody to change if they aren't willing.", "Ditch the guy and keep the dog.  That level of debt and continuing to spend so much on vaping is a bad combo.  He's showing you who he is - selfish and irresponsible.", "Only starting to question it? He\u2019s a lying, stealing addict who is making his bad decisions your problem.\n\nTake a look at how your budget could be if you were single and picture not having your partner steal from and lie to you.", "I refuse Reddit jumps on the do not marry bandwagon far too often but in this case I really think you should reconsider marrying this man. Financial disagreements are one of the biggest causes of divorce and if he destroys your credit rating it will take you years to recover.", "He\u2019s going to drag you down. NTA", "What is he doing to help himself?", "Now throw kids into the mix. It will be so much worse. You think he will ever change? Nope. Dump this dumpster fire excuse for a man and find someone normal.", "$700 per month?? Jesus Christ he might as well just take up cocaine at that price.", "You are boo boo the fool by continuing this relationship with a money pit that shows no remorse when stealing from his dog.", "Nicotine lozenges are cheaper stronger.  Quite smoking 15 years ago and still use the lozenges.  \n\nMight be worth a try.  However I would never put my nicotine above anything for my dogs.\n\nNTA BF is a huge AH.", "As somebody that went from 28 box a day {X2 on weekends} to a 50\u20ac Voopoo vape and then 3x10ml liquid that costs 10\u20ac, I'd say he is spending the money on something else.", "No more. I'm sorry you're only putting yourself at a disadvantage and he's only taking it as \"oh I can do whatever\". He doesn't see it as the help you see it as.", "Is this how you want to spend the rest of your life? You will never have an equal partner, only someone who adds  emotional, financial and physical burdens. His vape usage will also inevitable lead to severe medical problems, and you\u2019ll be his Caretaker in addition to paying his medical bills.", "He is addicted. And takes no responsibility for his actions. Both concerns on their own are huge red flags. Together they are a nuclear bomb.", "Lol you are 21. You don't have to settle for a crippling drug addict. $700 a month on nicotine vapes is insane. That's more than some people with chronic pain spend on marijuana. At the very least get a refillable vape with vape juice ... but honestly ask yourself whether you want to marry a guy who will likely dip into the kids' college fund when he needs a fix.", "Def don't combine finances with someone in such a short amount of time together. NTA", "I think enabling is too harsh a term as you're trying to help him and you're only 21 years old. It says a lot about you that you're trying to help your partner get out of debt and help him budget even at your own expense, as you don't need it and it obviously brings tension into the relationship. You sound like a loving and responsible person. \n\nIt's not a partnership though if it's not based on equality between responsible adults. And with you being able to penalize eachother, it's just not that type of relationship.\n\nHis vaping is compulsive, it's an addiction. It's no different from other drug abuse and the things he does to get his fix are the same as people do to get heroin: lie, beg, steal. It's not different at all. Everyone who suffered in a similar situation you're in would tell you: you can't cure another persons addiction. You just can't.\n\nIt has nothing to do with you and it's not personal. And it's not your role to cure someone, not even your own partner. If the relationship is truly healthy, he's in control of getting better and you're just supporting that. It's ok to take him to treatments and what not, but you never ever become responsible for his cure. Because it's then not an equal partnership anymore, instantly. \n\nTherefore you indeed should not enforce anything harsh or control him, as you're not his keeper. \n\nIt may sound harsh to talk about addiction instead of financial differences, but that's just what it is.\n\nYou are responsible for yourself and the dog. The responsible adult thing to do is to split the finances, take care of the dog and let him take care of his own addiction. If you need to separate to prevent him from exhausting your budget, do that.\n\nIn general these types of relationships don't last in the long run, but it takes most people some time or many years to leave, that's a natural process that can't be sped up by strangers on reddit. I hope you read up on being a partner to an addict and that it helps open your eyes to what you need to do for you.", "I am going to tell you what I tell my kids: you cannot control other people's behavior (nor should you take on that burden), you can only control yourself. If the behavior is unacceptable, then don't accept it. The only thing you can do is to remove yourself.", "Why the heck are you with him?", "I guess the person above means you sound like you\u2019re the one to figure things out. Judging from this post and your comments about his financial issues, it seems highly probable that you\u2019re primarily the one that figured out the budget and given your concern for the dog vs his, you\u2019re probably the one taking care of the dog (in fact, I was wondering if the dog is both yours and his or just yours given how readily he dipped into that fund and without any apparent remorse). Basically, it sounds like you do the heavy lifting when it comes to making the plans and fixing large-scale problems like this which \u201cenables\u201d him to f*ck up because he knows you\u2019ll figure things out around his screw ups.", "He\u2019s also stealing and (most likely) lying to his family to fund his habit. Another sign that it is no longer a habit, but a full blown addiction.", "An addiction is not a problem per se, but it becomes a problem when you can't afford it and steal money from others. \n\nOP, i would take away his access to all the accounts except his spending money. Ok, thats not true, i would break up bc starting a future with someone so irresponsible with money and stealing would not be an option for me, but IF i would stay i would not give him access to my or the dogs money. \n\nBut be prepared to bail him out soon, if he has no problem stealing from you/the dog, he will very likely start stealing money from others or shoplifting. :(", ">$700 a month\n\nThat's $8500. That's a short European holiday. OP don't marry this man.", "I have a cousin who has a smoking and gambling addiction.\n\nHe's been stealing from everyone since he was a teenager, to the point where his dad kicked him out of the house for stealing his stepmum's hewellery and selling it to a pawnbroker for a freaction of the value. He somehow convinced someone to marry him, ended up in enough debt that he was evicted and had to move in with his in laws.\nHe then stole from them, and was kicked out but his wife begged her family and they let him stay in what was effectively their shed.\n\nTen years later, somehow still married, but is constantly asking everyone for money and has such a big debt that nothing is in his name, not his house, car, his mobile phone contract and he can't even have a bank account.\n\nHis wife won't leave him because she can't have children and in her culture, people who can't have children are seen as defective, so he constantly takes advantage of this.\n\nThe only two people who think he does no wrong are his mum and his younger brother. His younger brother is also the only reason he's not in prison and gets away with a lot because he is a lawyer with a lot of connections", "What's an example of an addiction not being a problem?", "It depends on the severity.

Steak will also kill you if consumed too often, however.", "Could you dm me with that too please?  I'm not there yet, but I'm now down to only one shop that hand-mixes vape and I really desperately dislike pretty much all the commercially available (they're either way too weak or too strong for my step-downing and smell weird and chemically.\n\n(Note: one of the very weird ways I got off smoking was really really liking the smell of vape; that literally got me into the shop to make yet another attempt to quit and I credit their sour apple vape for the fact my last cigarette was literally right before I walked in and got my first vape pen and juice).", "Right. I'm addicted to coffee in the way that, if I don't have it in the morning, my brain refuses to kick in fully.

It's a problem if it causes negative health effects...\n\nYou can't exclude the problem and then say it isn't a problem lol.", "Anything can have negative health effects in the wrong quantity or when used by the wrong person. I legit can't have too much salad because it would negatively impact some meds I need to be on. That being said, if I eat too much salad, it's not going to have the same negative side effects on my husband. However, if my salad habit got us evicted, that would be a problem for everyone, not just me putting my own health at risk."]}
