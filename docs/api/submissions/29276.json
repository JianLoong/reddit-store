Once the money is spent, its GONE. Two of the most important categories are our dog and \"spending money\" - our dogs funds never dip below a certain amount and is supposed to be for her food, toys, treats and vet bills. Our spending money is a set amount monthly and while I always end up with a little left by the end of the month, my fiance is always broke by the end of the first week.\n\nHe spends almost every penny on disposable vapes, and when he runs out of money he will steal them off of his brother or ask family to buy him them. He spent a large amount of money one month on a boxmod - insisting it would help lessen the expenses but he admitted it wasn't as strong as the disposables so he would deliberately use it before buying disposables to get a \"nic rush\".\n\nI went to check our expenses today after seeing him with a new disposable every day for the past week (he uses one up in A SINGLE DAY) only to discover our dogs funds have dipped down by literally 150 dollars. I am disgusted and annoyed. We agreed prior to the budgeting that using unallocated money would be penalised - which has now resulted in his spending money being lowered to pay back his debt to our dog.\n\nHes furious, and I refuse to budge as I would expect the same penalty if I was in his shoes. He has no remorse for stealing from our dog and I'm honestly irritated. He said he doesn't want to quit and he won't, I simply said he doesn't have to but he has to make do with his spending money for the next month.

Even at 4 vapes a week that's around 360$ a month.\n\nHow is he going through 1 every day? Unless he's literally hitting it the entire duration, that feels impossible. \n\n700$ worth of vapes in one month is ~35 a month at 20$ each(which can be cheaper too even on that side) which is more than 1 a day.\n\nSomething doesn't add up.", "I drank a gallon of coffee a day before I got diagnosed with ADHD as an adult, my coffee habit is what prompted my doc to refer me for testing. \ud83d\ude02", "I love Tribeca by Halo but it's \"tobacco\"  flavored (not really tastes more like caramel). Is it possible to make something like that?", "They are on the list under \"people (and dog) I can steal from without consequence\".", "Vapes used to be seen as the lesser of 2 evils when compared to smoking. But the more I hear about them the less sure of that I am.", "Yeah I use disposable vapes pretty heavily and I cannot figure out how he's spending that much on vapes alone.  If I were OP I'd be looking for signs of something else going on.", "Anecdotally?  My brother smoked a pack of Camel unfiltereds a day in his 20s. But, he stopped at 28 and just finished two half marathons and climbed Mt Whittaker at 41, so you might do okay! (These activities were not things he set out to do in a moment of midlife crisis. He happened to get a hyperactive dog, started running to tire the dog out, and discovered he liked it.)", "My roommate is a classic toy collector. He has them all over the house.

But yea, that is an addiction that definitely causes a problem.", "Reddit... seriously some nights I have to mentally kick myself to get off.", "Not all addictions are created equal, though. Take chemical addiction, for example. Caffeine (to use an example from others' comments) has incredibly low chemical addiction: there's a categorization that puts it in the lowest ranking because, like LSD, the brain saturates on it in short periods of time such that additional doses don't increase the pleasant effects. \n\nNicotine is ranked near heroin in terms of chemical addiction. Personally, I think that false equivalency of certain addictions undersells the danger of those addictions.", "It won\u2019t let me DM for some reason, so I\u2019ll just post it here.\n\nThe site I use for most of my supplies is www.bullcityflavors.com.  To get you started, you will need at least 1 liter vegetable glycerin (primary ingredient), 1 bottle of propylene glycol, 1 or more bottles of flavoring.\n\nYou will also need a bottle of concentrated nicotine.  Just search google and try to get one that\u2019s 100mg/ml to make measuring it easy (1ml nicotine per 100ml juice is 1% nicotine strength).\n\nIf it asks for base liquid for flavoring or nicotine, choose propylene glycol.  It\u2019s thinner and easier to work with than vegetable glycerin as a base liquid.\n\nUnfortunately, some of the measuring ingredients aren\u2019t available from BCF any more, but you should be able to buy something similar from Amazon.  You\u2019ll need a 50ml plastic beaker with measuring lines for most ingredients.  For nicotine, you will want a syringe with a metal tip and measurements so you can stick it in the nicotine bottle.  You will also want a 100 or 200ml bottle to make everything in.\n\nBasic recipe for 100 ml of juice is 75ml vg, 10ml pg, 5ml flavoring, 3ml nicotine.  Can be scaled up or down depending on how much you want to make, so for 200ml just double everything.  VG to PG ratio just depends on how thick or thin you want your juice.\n\nBasically just mix the ingredients together in the ratio above, shake it up a lot after making, and let it sit for at least a day to cure (otherwise it tastes a little weird, but still safe to vape if you\u2019re in a hurry).\n\nIt probably seems like a lot of steps, but once you do it once or twice, it becomes super easy.  Also, google is your friend, there\u2019s a lot of DIY mixers out there who are friendly and helpful if you have questions.\n\nHope this helps save some money!", "I have stolen coffee from work when I was out and couldn't make it to the store before it closed \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c", "You can die by drowning in 3 in of water.

During my last pregnancy, I weaned myself off but I couldn't handle not having my 3+ cups a day, so I made myself a blend of 3/4 decaf and 1/4 regular. If it hadn't been a high risk pregnancy, I probably wouldn't have just kept drinking coffee like I did in my previous one.", "Right. Which is where the word \"addiction\" comes in. If you're addicted to something, you're not enjoying it in moderation. If you're enjoying something in moderation, you're not addicted.

Maybe a super minor problem, but a problem nonetheless.", "i did that, too! tastes just as good, imo.", "NTA, but there is a deeper problem here and Y-W-B-T-A if you marry this man.  You should be a lot more than just irritated.  You should be calling off the wedding and making arrangements to separate.  He is an addict.

Either he gets it under control and lessens/quits his shitty habit or you\u2019re leaving him.

He does not seem to possess any redeeming qualities. Get out before he sells your dog for a vape.", "NTA- seems that funds were adequately discussed prior to this happening. As someone who vapes and doesn\u2019t want to drop thousands on disposables I\u2019d recommend him vgod juices. They have similar concentrations to disposables and save me so much money. I buy a bottle and it lasts me a month as opposed to getting like 10 disposables a month. (15-20$ vs. 150-200$ a month)", "NTA\n\nBut look into getting him help for his addiction because this is not healthy for him or you at this point.", "[removed]", "That seems like a crazy way to vape if he's going to vape heavily. Disposables are so, so much more expensive than an entry-level refillable pod pen and some high % nic salt liquids. Are you certain that he isn't using some of that money on another addiction (maybe to substances or gambling) or other secretive activities (like cheating/escorts)?\n\nNTA for what you're doing with the finances. Stealing money from a fund that is designated for the care of your dog is scummy behaviour. Are you sure you want to marry someone with such poor financial and ethical behaviours? If he has so little control over himself and is also this selfish, it might not be the happiest marriage.", "NTA\n\nAlso, you should seriously think through if you want to have this same conversation for the next however many decades.

Do you want to be with someone you can't put trust in financially? Do you think he will want to spend the rest of his life being financially restricted and punished? NAH, you have a budget, he needs a budget, but it seems like he doesn't actually want the budget. So at a guess I'd say a stricter one has been put in place than he can handle and that's also not fair.

But, in the end, you can't control other people, so that's not really a path.\n\nThe path is to disengage from his shenanagins. This might mean breaking up, or it might mean disentangling your finances. If he doesn't want to get his financial shit together, it's not your problem. Separate your finances, lock down the dog account, and tell himi he's on his own with his own financial situation.

One is a habit, the other is a real addiction.", "Oh, I know. I was married to an addict. It took me everything to not write an essay to OP in the comments because  i feel his vaping has become a telltale sign of a possible serious addict behavior issue. People vape, but they don't usually beg, borrow and steal to vape. I honestly wonder exactly why he's broke immediately after they budget their money. Seems too suspicious. I was just making a point that I agree with the idea that we've all got small \"addictions\", which he seems to be playing his off as, but they're generally harmless compared to real addiction."]}
