Recently our grandfather passed away. Bre and I were both able to travel to see him and offer support to our grandma before he died, but Ava was not since her husband is currently looking for work, and they're short on money. After he died, they decided to have the funeral within the week. I called Ava and told her that if she wanted to come to the funeral, I would pay for the gas. She thanked me and said she would.\n\nThe next day my grandma asked if Ava was coming for the funeral. I said yes. She asked if Ava's husband and kids were coming, and I said I wasn't sure. Bre spoke up and said, \"They'd have to since Ava is incapable-\" I cut her off and said that oh yes, they are coming. Bre tried to say another comment but I again cut her off and assured my grandma they would all be there. She left the room excited to see her great grandkids.\n\nBre asked why I interrupted her when all she was going to say was that Ava never bothered to learn to drive, so of course her husband would be coming. I replied that I knew Ava was embarrassed about not being able to drive and I didn't think we should make rude comments about her when she's not here to defend herself. Bre said that was stupid, and that if she didn't want people talking about her, she should just learn to do it. It's her own fault she doesn't know how. \n\nNow, this is not exactly true. She did try to learn but every time Ava sat behind the wheel she would have a panic attack. Could she have pushed through it? Yeah, maybe, but the fact is, it's not that she never bothered, it's that she found it too hard to push past her panic attacks. I tried to explain this to Bre, but again she said that she refuses to go with the \"that's just how they are\" line of thinking. \"If she didn't learn how, she shouldn't be surprised when people talk about her.\"\n\nExasperated, I asked her, \"Would you like it if we all talked about how you're overweight when you're not around? Someone could make the argument that if you don't want us saying that, you should just lose weight.\" Bre immediately got angry and said that's completely different. I asked her how. She stormed out.\n\nWhen we were teenagers my mom got surprisingly pregnant. She ended up losing the baby at 6 months and internally hemorrhaged. She almost died and then fell into a depression for almost a year because her baby died. My parents fought a lot during that time and nearly got divorced. It was a very difficult time for us, and we all coped in our own ways. Bre's way was to eat. I don't blame her for being overweight. Could she stop eating unhealthily now and workout? Yeah, probably, but just like Ava, there were extenuating circumstances that made her the way she is. I wasn't trying to make fun of her weight at all. It was just the only example I could think of that was a similar dilemma where things occurred beyond their control. \n\nBre is now angry at me for bringing up her weight.

Just like anxiety. \n\nAva should walk outside her glass house before she throws rocks\u2026\n\nEdit: *hated Not, not hated", "NTA. You gave her a hard lesson on empathy and from my experience it's an efficient one. My mom spent all her time saying badmouthing my friends...when I was in my forties! They were fat, or vulgar, or \"walked with their breasts first\" (my well-endowed best friend), their taste in clothes was awful... If I protested, she said \"it's the truth.\"\n\nOne day I snapped and I told her, \"Do you want me to tell my friends you're old, bitter and wrinkled? It's the truth.\"\n\nShe NEVER said a mean word about them again. \n\nI know her well, and diplomacy and a speech about empathy would not have worked.", "She stormed out because she didn't have a reply to \"how is that different?\".\n\nBre is being unfair with her double standard on when and how can people criticize others.\n\nNTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Anyways, apologize to her, because regardless of the good intentions, she is hurt.", "As an obese woman myself, NTA\n\nOut of all people, Bre should understand how hurtful it is to have people blaming you for circumstances that they assume to be 100% within your control just because *they* don't have the same issues you do.\n\nAnd your analogy was accurate: was there perhaps something Ava could have done about her driving skills in the past? Probably. Is there something she can do to improve her driving skills in the future? Possibly, although, as with weight, it's likely that prevention was a more viable option than fixing things many years down the line. \n\nBut regardless of whether it *could have* been avoided or *could* be changed in the future, is there anything to be done about it *now*? Definitely no. And is it AH-ish to make digs about people behind their back? Definitely yes", "NTA, you brought up a sensitive topic to help her think empathetically. \n\nYou put her in the shoes of the person she was criticizing and she didn't like how that made her feel. If she was a reflective person, she would have done the empathetic work herself, realized she wouldn't like being talked about that way, and extended that same courtesy to Ava. \n\nSince she's not reflective, or at least wasn't being reflective, she only felt discomfort when forced. Not being reflective, instead of dwelling on why she felt uncomfortable, she just reacted to the feeling, got angry, and left. \n\nMost people try to do this in their head before they say mean things about people.", "Generally, if someone does something to \"make a point\" I assume they're in the wrong. However, in this situation NTA. I certainly don't want to be on the road if another driver is \"pushing through\" a panic attack. That sounds dangerous for everyone, and Bre is being ignorant and rude to your sister.", "NTA. You were trying to be nice to your other sister and were trying to make her understand. \nMaybe the example wasn\u2019t the nicest for your sister to hear and you could explain to her that you didn\u2019t mean anything mean by it. \nBut definitely not the AH", "NTA because it\u2019s exactly the same. They both have conditions that are technically \u201cmanageable\u201d but haven\u2019t found the solutions yet. She\u2019s being ableist", "NTA.

Ava learning or not learning to drive is her decision, same as your sisters weight.", "NTA. I think you handled yourself well. Yes, weight is a sensitive, hot button issue, but I think it was a good analogy here. Your sister Bre sounds like the worst kind of cruel, where she is completely insensitive to others but extremely sensitive about herself. \n\nYou don\u2019t sound like the kind of person who would have brought this up otherwise. I applaud you for trying to keep things calm before people travel in for a FUNERAL. Your family just went through a loss and Bre is more concerned with being spiteful and risking causing division.

It\u2019s not a personal attack.", "ESH. You could have made your point by saying, \"she's my sister and I'm not going to sit back and listen to someone talk behind her back just like I wouldn't sit back and listen to someone talk about you behind your back\" \n\nYou had a good point to make but when you insulted her to make your point she got too defensive to hear your point. It not only was rude but it was counterproductive.", "NTA", "ESH\n\nI don't think saying someone can't drive in the context of discussing how someone will travel and discussing someone's weight are on the same level at all. And I got my driving license at 35 because of mental health issues. It's a bit embarrassing to be an adult who can't drive, but not anywhere near the abuse people endure because of social stigma around weight.\n\nYour sister could afford to mind her own business but I'm pretty sure you could have made the same point with a less hurtful example.", "I'm gunna go with an ESH. You were making a valid point and standing up for Ava, but you had to do it in a very mean way. You're not wrong, but what you did wasn't entirely right either. Bri clearly has low self esteem and issues to work through if she's attacking someone who can't drive. Lots of people can't drive for many reasons. Does She look down on all these people too? Or only the ones she deems have a \"valid\" excuse.", "ESH but also partially YTA.\n\nNobody wants a person experiencing panic attacks behind the wheel of a car. You can't just \"push past\" panic attacks, that's not how panic attacks work. You could have drove your point home without bringing up her weight. How is body shaming someone ever the way to show someone what they are saying is wrong?", "YTA. Countering Ava's driving thing with Bre's weight is both a bad comparison and just mean.\n\nAlso, you could have just said to Grandma, \"Ava doesn't drive, so I imagine the whole family will be coming.\" You could have described the situation honestly without making it seem like it's somehow shameful or embarrassing that she doesn't drive.", "YTA\n\nListen, I get that you were trying to defend your sister and I applaud you for it, but throwing someone's weight in their face is just not right, especially since she's your sister as well. I, of course, don't know you or your family, but I don't think your sister not driving doesn't affect her as much as being feeling uncomfortable with your body can, especially when people are talking about it and bringing it up.", "YTA\n\nWowwww.....", "How is saying someone can't drive being mean?", "NTA  You were just trying to make a point and not in a mean way.   No worries.", "NTA. You used info to make a serious point to someone who refused to see that their comments would be hurtful to the family member. It wasn't done in front of others or behind her back. You may still want to apologize for hurting her feelings but I don't think you were in the wrong of how you handled the conversation.", "A death in the family.
