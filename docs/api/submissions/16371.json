Recently our grandfather passed away. Bre and I were both able to travel to see him and offer support to our grandma before he died, but Ava was not since her husband is currently looking for work, and they're short on money. After he died, they decided to have the funeral within the week. I called Ava and told her that if she wanted to come to the funeral, I would pay for the gas. She thanked me and said she would.\n\nThe next day my grandma asked if Ava was coming for the funeral. I said yes. She asked if Ava's husband and kids were coming, and I said I wasn't sure. Bre spoke up and said, \"They'd have to since Ava is incapable-\" I cut her off and said that oh yes, they are coming. Bre tried to say another comment but I again cut her off and assured my grandma they would all be there. She left the room excited to see her great grandkids.\n\nBre asked why I interrupted her when all she was going to say was that Ava never bothered to learn to drive, so of course her husband would be coming. I replied that I knew Ava was embarrassed about not being able to drive and I didn't think we should make rude comments about her when she's not here to defend herself. Bre said that was stupid, and that if she didn't want people talking about her, she should just learn to do it. It's her own fault she doesn't know how. \n\nNow, this is not exactly true. She did try to learn but every time Ava sat behind the wheel she would have a panic attack. Could she have pushed through it? Yeah, maybe, but the fact is, it's not that she never bothered, it's that she found it too hard to push past her panic attacks. I tried to explain this to Bre, but again she said that she refuses to go with the \"that's just how they are\" line of thinking. \"If she didn't learn how, she shouldn't be surprised when people talk about her.\"\n\nExasperated, I asked her, \"Would you like it if we all talked about how you're overweight when you're not around? Someone could make the argument that if you don't want us saying that, you should just lose weight.\" Bre immediately got angry and said that's completely different. I asked her how. She stormed out.\n\nWhen we were teenagers my mom got surprisingly pregnant. She ended up losing the baby at 6 months and internally hemorrhaged. She almost died and then fell into a depression for almost a year because her baby died. My parents fought a lot during that time and nearly got divorced. It was a very difficult time for us, and we all coped in our own ways. Bre's way was to eat. I don't blame her for being overweight. Could she stop eating unhealthily now and workout? Yeah, probably, but just like Ava, there were extenuating circumstances that made her the way she is. I wasn't trying to make fun of her weight at all. It was just the only example I could think of that was a similar dilemma where things occurred beyond their control. \n\nBre is now angry at me for bringing up her weight.

Probably. Is there something she can do to improve her driving skills in the future? Possibly, although, as with weight, it's likely that prevention was a more viable option than fixing things many years down the line. \n\nBut regardless of whether it *could have* been avoided or *could* be changed in the future, is there anything to be done about it *now*? Definitely no. And is it AH-ish to make digs about people behind their back?

Any other circumstance maybe this would warrant hate but it\u2019s seems like bre needs to realize the weight behind her words.", "Nope,\n\n\" I tried to explain this to Bre, but again she said that she refuses to go with the \"that's just how they are\" line of thinking. \"If she didn't learn how, she shouldn't be surprised when people talk about her.\"\"\n\n OP made her point already when she explained about the panic attacks but the sister doubled down on it so OP had to make an equal comparison to give her another point of view. It was absolutely necessary.", "Maybe it's simply because I'm not American and public transport is not that awful where I live, but I don't see how not having a driver's license could be embarrassing.", "I\u2019m fat and too anxious to drive. You\u2019ll get bullied more for the lack of driving, I promise you.", "it will always blow my mind that we are such a car centric country that not wanting to operate a 3000lb metal machine to get around town makes you unreasonable. especially since I\u2019ve heard the sentence \u201cthat person shouldn\u2019t have a license\u201d from every fucking driver I\u2019ve ever been in the car with", "If she doesn\u2019t want people to talk about her weight she should just lose it. This is according to the story the sister train of thought in regards to her other sister so.", "AND WHAT IS THE PROBLEM? if being fat is not an insult it is a fact, also if you do not want to be insulted do not do it with others", "hahaha OP could also have said \"bre may not be over 40 because she's fat\", if you're fat you are, period, a panic attack is more complicated, if you're fat it's because you don't take care of yourself", "No it the exact comparison. One can\u2019t control her weight and the other can\u2019t control her anxiety. Both shouldn\u2019t be criticised when not there.", "There is the both have a valid reason for their short coming.", "That's totally fair", "You were supposed to but on your business boobs not your recreational boobs for dealing with them.", "Women are always wrong, no matter what. That's how they get you to make choices that don't benefit you for a tiny bit of approval in return.", "I remember someone saying this once meaning that they were being flaunty (ridiculous) and thinking \"how tf else are you supposed to walk? genuinely, my boobs are the part of my body that sticks out furthest in front of me... there's nothing I can do but walk \"breasts first\" unless I walk backwards. But then I suppose I'd be walking ass first so no better lol", "As someone whose mom does the same. It means she NEEDS to find something to dislike. It doesn't matter what it is, in this girls case she noticed the boobs first but it could've been anything. Don't listen to what people say if they don't care about you, most of the time it's meaningless and they don't even think twice about it, other times it's just people being mean. Both deserve no attention", "How tf am I supposed to walk with my breasts second? Take them off and attach them to the back?", "I'm trying to picture a woman not walking with her breasts first. Backwards? Crawling? Some sort of military marching?", "My youngest son is like this. He didn\u2019t even have an interest in getting his license until he was 23. He didn\u2019t drive much at all until he got a car and was living on his own. He had to drive to work and grocery store type stuff. He\u2019ll drive here where I live but he won\u2019t drive in our city. His anxiety has gotten better but it is still there and at times it\u2019s worse than others.", "This really did happen. I can message you pictures of the funeral if you'd like. No one's blowing up my phone because this was just a conversation between the 2 of us, and we don't bring our family into every disagreement, especially when someone just died. There were more important things going on. \n\nI used the phrase stormed out because it's succinct, and there's a limit on how much can be written in these posts. If you can give me a way to say \"angrily and hastily left the room\" that's shorter than \"stormed out\", I'll be happy to edit that in for you", "You might also mention to Bre that it's not fair to say someone should learn how to drive regardless of their anxiety (if you haven't pointed it out already). Ava would not only be putting herself in danger behind the wheel, but everyone else on the road she would meet. If she can't get through her panic attacks then it's better she doesn't drive until she can get better if she so chooses. Driving isn't a requirement as an adult.", "I\u2019ve been in minor accidents as well (never had airbags deploy), and can relate to it absolutely tanking your driving confidence. Does your son know that most people who have been driving for a while have been in at least one accident, however minor?\n\nI ask because I only learned that years later, and it did a lot to tell me that I wasn\u2019t an unusually poor driver, accidents and near misses genuinely do happen and I thought they were rarer than they are. I\u2019m not an absolutely amazing driver, because sometimes \u201cbe cautious\u201d overwhelms \u201cbe predictable,\u201d but it turns out I\u2019m actually at least average. Before learning more context, I would\u2019ve said I was a terrible driver, and I was definitely a more anxious one.", "But\u2026both those are true statements. She is not capable of driving, and she didn\u2019t learn.", "oh yeah i completely agree", "It me! I should never be behind the wheel for many reasons including anxiety and poor depth perception. I've accepted my fate as a non driver.", "When I was teaching my daughter to drive,  she got stuck in a situation.  \"Mom, mom, what do I do?\" I asked her to think about it, figure it out and she lost her shit. I told her that if she's going to be that emotional, she shouldn't be driving.", "I have tried to learn how to drive twice and honestly it was torture. I was constantly stressed and the thought of my next lesson made me want to vomit. It\u2019s an awful feeling when you know other people do it so easily that I constantly think of giving it a third try. I really hate it though.", "That is pretty much my reasoning for not learning to drive after finding out that being on the road with cars makes my head kinda fuzzy. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a full panic attack but I definitely get nervous enough that I feel it\u2019s unsafe for me to drive. I was perfectly fine in a parking lot with little to no other cars but as soon as I got on a \u201creal\u201d road it was like I just couldn\u2019t think properly.\n\nIt really sucks cause America doesn\u2019t have the infrastructure for people who can\u2019t drive except in really big cities so it\u2019s super hard to get a job I can actually do. I tried going on disability but it\u2019s also super hard to do that for mental issues though I can\u2019t remember if I brought up the unable to drive part. I might have to try again with that being the main reason I need it. \n\nAnyways I am definitely kind of embarrassed by it but I myself am not too against telling people. It\u2019s more the unemployment and if I ever manage it being on disability that makes me super embarrassed. I would like to be a productive member of society but it can be so hard.", "My depth perception is horrible. I might be able to drive once before the intrusive thoughts won out and I yeeted myself off a cliff or a bridge. I struggle in the passenger seat of the car to not the intrusive thoughts win.", "I mean if it's to shame someone about their weight then yeah that's an AH move. But this wasn't that - this was a direct comparison on \"something about you that other people might talk about behind your back\". I'm generally Team Leave People's Weight Out Of It, but this was a particular type of situation that changes the calculation.", "This is fair. I figured there was something in tone  or history that you weren\u2019t conveying that made it obvious but you\u2019re also right that starting out Ava being incapable of driving as opposed to just saying she doesn\u2019t drive is different. One is likely judging her inability to drive while the other is neutrally stating a fact.", "NTA \n\nI think you brought it up in such a considerate way! I'm sure that if Ava had said something about Bre's weight, you would have deffended her too.  You were right. She shouldn't have talked about Ava's insecurities if she can't talk about her own.", "She doesn\u2019t seem to be hahahaha", "Up until high school, I was constantly underweight. Even through college I was well within the \"normal\" bmi. But I'm on multiple types of meds that all screw with my metabolism, and they're all necessary to keep me functional, so I've gained a good deal of weight. I'm also physically disabled now, which puts a damper on my exercise options lol.\n\nTbh, I'm happier in my body now than when I was teeny tiny in high school. I have moments where I feel self conscious, but I don't generally hate looking at myself in the mirror.", "He is still driving to work\u2026but he won\u2019t drive anywhere he\u2019s never been. I have told him that experience helps you better avoid accidents\u2026but there is nothing that makes *being* in accident any less jarring.", " I tried to explain this to Bre, but again she said that she refuses to go with the \"that's just how they are\" line of thinking. \"If she didn't learn how, she shouldn't be surprised when people talk about her.\"\n\nOP tried to make the point without making comparisons but Bri wasn't having it", "And ops statement was also true", "So is \u201cshe is overweight\u201d and \u201cshe should lose weight\u201d. Even if something is true it doesn\u2019t mean it is always correct and nice to say it.", "It\u2019s really not being an asshole at all.  It\u2019s just bringing up an example that Bre can actually understand.  You\u2019re just being hardheaded and defensive towards someone who doesn\u2019t deserve the energy you\u2019re putting into this defense", "She\u2019s probably brought it up to shame Ava, to be honest. She may even think that if she shames her enough, she\u2019ll \u201cget over\u201d her anxiety. Bre clearly doesn\u2019t understand anxiety at all.", "Exactly!  My cousin chose to never drive because of how aggressive she is and how she'd probably have terrible road rage.  Also because of how much more expensive it was than taking the bus.", "My bonus kid is like this a d I dread the day he gets his liscence", ">if I was legally allowed to drive it wouldn't be long before I soared off a fucking cliff\n\nHave you considered being a pilot?", "I really need to be able to drive but I'm not the sort of person that would be decisive enough on the roads to be safe. I'm stuck with buses.", "The people who hassle you are the shits.", "Was really ready to be on OP for this because weight is something much less under people's control than most people assume.", "I live in a super tiny apartment and never rearrange furniture. The amount of times a day that I misjudge where something is and run right into it tells me that I would also end up yeeting myself off a bridge.", "I hope you are discussing this with a licensed therapist.\n\nI get the intrusive thoughts too, and learned to live with them, but the psychiatrist was immediately alarmed when I mentioned them (casually).", "Oh, it\u2019s absolutely jarring. My first (and definitely worst) accident was from hydroplaning, and all I could tell was that my brakes weren\u2019t working all of a sudden. I\u2019m fine driving in pretty bad conditions now that I know what it feels like and how to respond, but that was a surprise downpour on a clear day soon after I got my license. I made a completely reasonable decision to drive that day and a completely reasonable decision to pull over when it got bad, and ended up in a ditch from inexperience. \n\nI kept driving after that because I had to, then got rear-ended at a stop sign a year later. I was fully stopped, absolutely not at fault and no damage, but I still felt like I should\u2019ve somehow prevented it. And so on. \n\nAccidents are scary, and it was really hard to trust my judgment as a driver, or believe that I would actually see what I needed to going on around me. It did help to learn that those happen to everybody, or close enough - my judgement wasn\u2019t unusually bad. \n\nSo yeah, accidents are scary even if they\u2019re very minor, and I sympathize with your son! I don\u2019t know how bad his accident was, but I\u2019m assuming minor since you mentioned a roundabout and hopefully nobody was going very fast.", ">OP tried to make the point without making comparisons but Bri wasn't having it\n\nRight, so OP decided to do exactly what Bre did (i.e. be the AH) to show her how she was being the AH, except with escalation, etc.\n\nEdit: I still think the fact that you are inconveniencing everyone who needs to drive you places is relevant here and is a contrast to being overweight which inconveniences no one in this situation. This was a situation in which the sister needs someone else to do something for her because she can't/won't do it herself. Bre was too humiliated to continue the conversation; this does not mean he was right or that there was not another side to this story.", "Here's an argument for you then. A phobia, while serious, is something you can treat with drugs and/or therapy. I'm not saying it should be made fun of! But it's not something that the rest of the family should be bending over backwards to cover for. It's fine to say, \"Ava doesn't drive.\" Obesity, on the other hand, is a much more complex issue, both physiologically and psychologically. And OP apparently thinks it's ok to pathologize her sister and bring up the story about their mother's miscarriage and depression out of nowhere?", "My 96yo grandmother never got her license because she wasn\u2019t comfortable driving. Nothing wrong with it. I waited until I was 21 cuz I was sick of people telling me to GET IT NOW! They stopped bugging me and I got it in my own time \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Okay, you got me, that was fucking hilarious", "But OP didn't talk about Bre behind her back; they just posed it as an analogy, like \"wouldn't you be offended if I said _______ about you.\" And the only person who would be driving here is Bre's husband, and it may not be a common problem depending on the public transit systems where they live and her lifestyle. Also being overweight does inconvenience other people, such as on planes or other mass transportation or restricting group activities.", "You seem pretty upset hahahaha", "That\u2019s shocking.  You seem like the type to get triggered multiple times a day."]}
