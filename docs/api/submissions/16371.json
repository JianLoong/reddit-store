Recently our grandfather passed away. Bre and I were both able to travel to see him and offer support to our grandma before he died, but Ava was not since her husband is currently looking for work, and they're short on money. After he died, they decided to have the funeral within the week. I called Ava and told her that if she wanted to come to the funeral, I would pay for the gas. She thanked me and said she would.\n\nThe next day my grandma asked if Ava was coming for the funeral. I said yes. She asked if Ava's husband and kids were coming, and I said I wasn't sure. Bre spoke up and said, \"They'd have to since Ava is incapable-\" I cut her off and said that oh yes, they are coming. Bre tried to say another comment but I again cut her off and assured my grandma they would all be there. She left the room excited to see her great grandkids.\n\nBre asked why I interrupted her when all she was going to say was that Ava never bothered to learn to drive, so of course her husband would be coming. I replied that I knew Ava was embarrassed about not being able to drive and I didn't think we should make rude comments about her when she's not here to defend herself. Bre said that was stupid, and that if she didn't want people talking about her, she should just learn to do it. It's her own fault she doesn't know how. \n\nNow, this is not exactly true. She did try to learn but every time Ava sat behind the wheel she would have a panic attack. Could she have pushed through it? Yeah, maybe, but the fact is, it's not that she never bothered, it's that she found it too hard to push past her panic attacks. I tried to explain this to Bre, but again she said that she refuses to go with the \"that's just how they are\" line of thinking. \"If she didn't learn how, she shouldn't be surprised when people talk about her.\"\n\nExasperated, I asked her, \"Would you like it if we all talked about how you're overweight when you're not around? Someone could make the argument that if you don't want us saying that, you should just lose weight.\" Bre immediately got angry and said that's completely different. I asked her how. She stormed out.\n\nWhen we were teenagers my mom got surprisingly pregnant. She ended up losing the baby at 6 months and internally hemorrhaged. She almost died and then fell into a depression for almost a year because her baby died. My parents fought a lot during that time and nearly got divorced. It was a very difficult time for us, and we all coped in our own ways. Bre's way was to eat. I don't blame her for being overweight. Could she stop eating unhealthily now and workout? Yeah, probably, but just like Ava, there were extenuating circumstances that made her the way she is. I wasn't trying to make fun of her weight at all. It was just the only example I could think of that was a similar dilemma where things occurred beyond their control. \n\nBre is now angry at me for bringing up her weight.

Probably. Is there something she can do to improve her driving skills in the future? Possibly, although, as with weight, it's likely that prevention was a more viable option than fixing things many years down the line. \n\nBut regardless of whether it *could have* been avoided or *could* be changed in the future, is there anything to be done about it *now*? Definitely no. And is it AH-ish to make digs about people behind their back?

I cannot get behind the wheel of a car without completely freezing up, the second my hands touch the wheel, I smell his blood and hear his gurgling. \n\nIt's safer for EVERYONE if I don't drive, and I am so sick of being teased or mocked for it, that now I just say straight out if someone makes a dig about it- \"I was in a bad crash as a teen and my friend didn't make it. That's why I don't drive.\"", "My husband always says this whenever people give me a hard time about not driving. I survived a major car accident and then two years later, lost my father to a car accident. As hard as I try, I cannot overcome that anxiety and I know I would not be a safe driver. I am a nervous passenger, let alone a driver.", "Agreed, and it's no one's business why the sister doesn't drive. I understand why she's embarrassed though, especially if this is how others talk about her for something that doesn't even affect them.", "Driving is legitimately a dangerous activity and it's sort of insane that so many people do it daily. Last year something like 40,000 people died in car wrecks. Being anxious about driving seems like the most rational thing in the world.", "My son was 18 before he got his license. He really didn\u2019t have an interest before then. I was the one who taught him because I was much calmer than my husband\u2026and was able to hide my terror much better. I don\u2019t think he will ever drive in a city\u2026and to be honest, I\u2019ve been driving for 30+ years and I avoid it if I can. There are way too many things to have to pay attention to\u2014traffic lights, traffic, and pedestrians.", "Are you me? I went thru a very similar situation - no one to really teach me. Lived my early 20's using public transit. Finally got my license at 26 when a driving school opened near me. That was almost 20 years ago and my family still makes fun of me for it. ..", "Same here. I decided to pay for a professional driving instructor in my early 20s and it was money well-spent. Having someone teach me who was calm, kind and nonjudgmental really helped.", "Anxiety really sucks.", "Same after kids and health issues I went from skinny with boobs - I was never vocal about judgements - but I was judgy as a kid could be in my head.  Now I realize that I was asshole - even if just in my own head about that kind of stuff.", "If you do this though you have to do the hands too", "Not to mention if they start hyperventilating while actively driving!", "I'm really sorry you went through that. I hope you are doing okay these days", "33 and same.", "Yep. I never said it out loud but boy I thought some mean things.", "My biggest thing is walking down steps. If I can't have someong walk down in front of me, then I have to go super slow. I also have to be very careful getting off escalators too.", "I am learning to live with them and what causes them the most. I've learning being in the car when I'm super tired, really upset or just having a bad day mental health wise can cause me to have them. Music helps, I have to have music in the car at all times, even if it's just playing super low.", "Yikes\u2014I was in an accident with a friend in high school (she was driving, I was a passenger) and she hydroplaned into a guardrail on an exit ramp. It was scary. \nI really just wanted him to know that nothing prepares you for how it feels to be in an accident\u2026it sucks no matter how old you are and how long you\u2019ve been driving. And in the US\u2026especially in the area where we live *no one* seems to have a clue how to navigate roundabouts. He was only going 15mph and his car was drivable\u2014it was not a terrible accident. I do need to have him practice on some easier circles because I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be able to avoid them forever.", "My grandmother didn't drive until all of her children were well into adulthood. I'm now in my 40s and both of my (paternal) grandparents have passed on, but knowing how my Poppy drove -  I don't blame her, at all.  \n\nOnce I became a driver, it made me understand that he was a terrible driver, and it made my much younger sibling super car sick everytime he drove with them in the car. My grandmother was scared to drive for a long time, but man she was totally the better driver between the two of them, smh lol.", "This is EXACTLY why I don't drive as well. It's not really a self-confidence thing, I just don't *want* the responsibility - and don't necessarily trust everyone else on the road either. If I lived in many other places I would have to suck it up and learn anyway but I'm lucky that using public transport instead is viable locally and I fly or take a long distance bus for trips between cities.", ">\"But OP didn't talk about Bre behind her back; they just posed it as an analogy, like \"wouldn't you be offended if I said \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ about you\"\n\nOP called his sister fat, but made sure to do it in a way where it seemed somewhat relevant. Saying \"What if hypothetically we discussed the fact that you're fat\" isn't a less AH behaviour than actually discussing that behind the person's back.\n\n>\"And the only person who would be driving here is Bre's husband\"\n\nYep, in this particular situation, it is only the husband who is inconvenienced (which is still a person being inconvenienced).  Additional information would be needed to tell how often it inconveniences her siblings and family. I believe the story begins with OP giving her gas money.\n\n>\"Also being overweight does inconvenience other people, such as on planes or other mass\"\n\nThat's why I said \"in this situation\", in case someone decided to go with this stretch.", "Most of my concern with driving - especially living in an area with 4 distinct seasons, and usually a ton of snow in the winter - is absolutely other drivers. \n\nI hate driving in the snow normally, even if I was the only one on the road, but then you have to worry about other drivers...like how experienced they are; if they're paying attention; if they have good tires, brakes or a decently maintained vehicle; if they are dangerous drivers in suboptimal conditions;  etc. etc. etc. ad nauseam."]}
