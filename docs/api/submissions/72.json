He would take my stuff or fill my mini-fridge with his stuff and take my stuff out of the fridge to get his in. I talked with him once and it kept happening. So I got a large lock box and locked my stuff away. I put a lock on my fridge and threw all his food away. Then I slowly stole albums (this was 40 years ago) from this collection and hid them in a buddy's room in another dorm. Bob finally looked for an album and couldn't find it. I told him one of his buddies probably took it cause he would let a few guys borrow them. After a few days he decided I took it but he couldn't find it or several others in our room, cause they were hidden away in my buddy's room. Suddenly all the albums showed up in his good buddy's, Bill's, room and he was so busy going to war with him, he apologized to me for accusing me. Then he spent the semester fighting with Bill. Bill had a roommate, Joe, who hated Bill as much as I hated Bob so he let me put the albums in Bill and Joe's room to start the war. Joe and I concocted this idea cause we both hated our roommates.

I'm sorry this is happening and I hope your RA or other school admin can help you resolve the situation. \n\nAs a side note, I wouldn't call it gaslighting- that word gets thrown around a lot but it typically very specific and kind of rare behavior.

You for not explicitly communicating your expectations - don\u2019t touch my stuff, don\u2019t eat my food, ever - and her for denying what she obviously did.
