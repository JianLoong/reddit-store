There were 8 of us, we had a reservation and were seated 30 minutes late.  Our server warned us that they were understaffed in both the front and back of the house but would do his best to take care of us.\n\nFirst round of drinks came fine, but then we got the wrong appetizers, our second round of drinks almost a half hour after we ordered them (the bartenders were not busy, the orders just weren't put in).  As we were still waiting for our entrees I spoke briefly with a manager about these long delays, he apologized.  Entrees finally arrived, half of them were wrong -- not a missing substitution wrong, the entire thing was wrong.  It was another twenty minutes until everyone had what they ordered.  And that third round of drinks?  Came fifteen minutes later and again the bar was not busy.\n\nOur waiter was kind and polite about it but clearly unable to handle the situation.  A 90 minute to 2 hour meal was turned into a 3+ hour ordeal and when the bill finally came with an automatic 20% gratuity, I asked to speak again to the manager and explained how disappointed I was, he removed the auto gratuity and I left a 10% on a $1600 tab.  \n\nMy wife and my sister in law were both upset that I 'made a scene' about it and said I should have just left it as is.  My point is if you're spending that much money on a special occasion, you should expect a certain amount of service especially since those tips are spread throughout everyone serving, and the service was shoddy at best.\n\nAITA for asking for the automatic gratuity to be removed and replaced with a lower amount because of the level of service we received.", "created_utc": 1684703318, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13o6efs/aita_for_asking_to_have_the_automatic_gratuity/", "score": 2402, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They could also turn down anyone without a reservation knowing they had parties booked.", "Given how bad service was, NTA. I think that when service is truly that bad it's ridiculous. I understand they were understaffed and probably doing their best, but saying \"we're understaffed but will do our best to take care of you\" justifies the late drinks and seating, not the wrong meals and appetizers.

You didn't have the evening that you expected and deserved, which is sad and bad. But I have to tell you, I work in the industry and I can assure you that the staff felt bad as well. It's nobody's fault but the owners for not paying enough for people to want to work/stay there. There doesn't seem to be a lack of care on the workers side, as far as I can gather from your post.", "Here\u2019s the thing, and there\u2019s no reason why you should have to ask about this, but there is a difference between asking to have food items removed versus asking the tip to be lowered. It depends on how the server tips out the support staff. Most places I\u2019ve worked at demanded the server tip out a percentage of the sales rather than the tips. Which means that the support staff, who might have been just as responsible for the bad service as the server themselves, still get the same percentage from the server as if you tipped 20%. So the only one getting screwed is the server, when it could\u2019ve equally been the fault of the support staff and the restaurant themselves. The better thing to do would\u2019ve been to ask for food items to be taken off the bill or an overall discount.\n\nEdit: sorry, forgot I was in AITA and not /serverlife.

In this case I would have probably done the same thing cuz it cut your tip in half and the service was poor. Sure the short staffing didn't help but I would not do 20% on poor service.

You all probably took their whole section all night and then they had to give that 10% to support staff.

I am bouncing between ESH and NAH.\n\nIf the restaurant is understaffed, that isn't the fault of the server, it's the fault of the management. Additionally, if this led to the server being sat more tables than usual and expected to do more than what is reasonable, that is again a failure of management, not the server. \n\nEven the best servers will make errors if they are burdened with double their normal expected workload all of a sudden. This wouldn't occur with proper staffing, management and leadership. The manager should have controlled seating at the door, turned away non-reservations when they could and set better expectations personally with the guests. Additionally management should have been utilizing staff better. If the bartenders weren't busy, they should be directed to pick up tables and help the servers.\n\nTo punish the server for all this isn't really the right thing to do here.\n\nAll of that said, lets look at the other side of this.\n\nYour party is an 8-top reservation at what I assume is likely an independent and relatively higher priced establishment. I would guess that there's a wine list, market pricing for some seafood and proteins, etc. In dining at this level, any server knowing what they are doing should and would making this party their very highest priority. To the point of telling management \"You need to find someone to take some of my other tables so I can focus on this party\".  Being that its a reservation and knowing ahead of time, they should have had much of the start of your evening prepared and ready to execute quickly. \n\nIf you're going to place an auto-grat on a party at a place like this then part of the expectation and promise is that the service makes you a priority. Clearly your party didn't feel as if it was treated as a priority when you certainly should have. Regardless of the reasons behind the server making mistakes, they certainly did make them and it did impact your experience. u/dunkirkFitz I completely can understand as to why you wouldn't want to tip a full 20% because of this.\n\nWhat I would argue though is to look at the larger picture. Normally from that tip, a server is expected to tipout on average 3 - 5% of bill to the house to pay the bartenders, bussers and sometimes hostesses. So on a check of $1600, the server (regardless of what they are tipped) will have to pay these other staff members $48 - $80. Whether the server gets tipped $160 or $320, the amount they tip out doesn't change.\n\nThe problem here is that everyone who should have been helping the server and preventing this situation from happening will still get paid. The only person who loses hard is the server. They not only lose out on the tip, but they have to still pay everyone who set them up to fail.\n\nI've been in the industry for over 20 years and have been the guest plenty of times myself. Based on your experience I probably would consider lowering my tip somewhat as well due to the fact that regardless of the why, I still did have my evening damaged as whole. That said, I would factor the rest into what I did decide to tip. Likely I would go with 15% not 10%. Additionally I would write an e-mail to the owner detailing the experience and explain what happened. I would include the matter of management not doing what they could to help but instead just removing the grat.", "It wasn\u2019t the servers fault.", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Our server warned us that they were understaffed in both the front and back of the house but would do his best to take care of us.\n\nFirst round of drinks came fine, but then we got the wrong appetizers, our second round of drinks almost a half hour after we ordered them (the bartenders were not busy, the orders just weren't put in).  As we were still waiting for our entrees I spoke briefly with a manager about these long delays, he apologized.  Entrees finally arrived, half of them were wrong -- not a missing substitution wrong, the entire thing was wrong.  It was another twenty minutes until everyone had what they ordered.  And that third round of drinks?  Came fifteen minutes later and again the bar was not busy.\n\nOur waiter was kind and polite about it but clearly unable to handle the situation.  A 90 minute to 2 hour meal was turned into a 3+ hour ordeal and when the bill finally came with an automatic 20% gratuity, I asked to speak again to the manager and explained how disappointed I was, he removed the auto gratuity and I left a 10% on a $1600 tab.  \n\nMy wife and my sister in law were both upset that I 'made a scene' about it and said I should have just left it as is.  My point is if you're spending that much money on a special occasion, you should expect a certain amount of service especially since those tips are spread throughout everyone serving, and the service was shoddy at best.\n\nAITA for asking for the automatic gratuity to be removed and replaced with a lower amount because of the level of service we received.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "The restaurant knew ahead of time that people will be coming. Staffing is their responsibility. \n\nIf they charge big bucks, they should provide big service. \n\nGiving into a shitty system only enables it. You did the right thing. NTA.", "NTA. I am a pretty okay tipper. I tip when I pick up take out. 20 to 25%. I got tired of it. I feel there's a huge push to tip well even when you get poor service and that led to me going out less. \n\nWe went out today, didn't get water, didn't get our ordered drinks until after our food came and we had to ask again. My aunt had to ask for her drink three times. No refills offered or checked on. A manager even stopped by our table and asked if we had everything and we said no, we didn't get our drinks and she said okay and walked away. It was weird.", "NTA no way are you the ah.", "NTA. It doesn't sound like you made a scene, and the management agreed to remove it.", "NTA\n\nI disagree with the people saying most of it sounds like the servers mistake. \n\nForgetting to put in drink orders is on the server. \n\nMaking sure the correct food comes to the table (unless they have someone specific for that) is on the server. \n\nThe server is your liason to the rest of the staff. That means they actually have to communicate, and it doesn't sound like this server was doing that. Additionally, it's unlikely that this server only had an 8-top as their only table all night, especially if they were understaffed.\n\nEdit: If the manager was a decent person AND knew it wasn't the servers fault, they would have comped a portion of your meal but insisted on leaving the tip at 20%.", "NTA. You still left a $150/160 tip even though the manager didn't help the server when they clearly should've. Managers never wanting to step in and \"get their hands dirty\" is a massive problem in nearly every industry.\n\nI have plenty of... interesting things... to say about the GM I worked under for years but one thing's for sure: if nobody was available to plunge a toilet or change a bed or check in a guest, she'd do it.", "NTA as it wasn\u2019t simply slow service but completely wrong in all the courses.  A certain level of service is to be expected regardless of staffing levels.  If management needed more help they should have been in the trenches helping.", "NTA.", "NTA - I'm from a country that doesn't require tipping, most places don't even have a tip jar or the option of receipts, so I don't understand why a gratuity is at a set amount and not what the customer decides.  A group of friends and I eat out often and we've never had issues like the OP and if there is any problem it is usually fixed at the time or with a discount on the bill.", "Nta. I'm a server, and I believe you should tip based on service. They failed at providing decent service with the repeated mistakes and slow wait time. It is sort of an industry wide problem in regards to staffing issues, so unfortunately most people are waiting longer for food if its even a little busy; but they did themselves no favors by failing to be accurate. You can't get shit wrong and expect to be rewarded for it.", "NTA\n\nThe server should not have served appetizers and entrees that were wrong.  There's a good chance that the server put in the order incorrectly or took the food intended for another table.", "NTA, I would've tipped $20", "NTA. Tipping is a plague on society.", "NTA. You tip a waiter on SERVICE and the service was not up to par. Look, you would be the AH if you left no tip but on service? That was fair and fine.", "NTA - in the uk they just wouldn\u2019t have been tipped at all. I get that the us is different so 10% is probably fair if staff just aren\u2019t paid enough to do their jobs. But why wouldn\u2019t you cut service if it\u2019s bad. \n\nThe only think otherwise you could\u2019ve done was instead of demanding removal of the gratuity, was demand they comp something = 20%, like the entrees that were late, or the late round of drinks. Then you know you\u2019re still getting a discount but paying the staff.", "NTA. They should have given you a fucking discount.", "NTA - a fancy expensive restaurant should be on their A game at all times - it\u2019s the manager fault cause a waitress who can not handle a big table of customers should not have been given your table to serve, if that means the manager needs to step in and help take care of the larger tables so be it. Though the delay in the drinks was the waitress fault and she brought you the wrong appetizers too. Poor service, you get a low tip, as well as mediocre food you get a low tip, but mediocre food & poor service you get no tip.", "NTA, partly because forced gratuities are absurd and ought to be outlawed, so regardless of how much you'd tipped or even if you'd tipped at all, I'd say NTA. But this is a really special kind of disastrous experience at a place where you're paying enough to expect a lot better.\n\nBy the way, your sister and your wife must be extremely wealthy people. Congratulations to them! As for the rest of us plebeians, a $1600 tab is no small thing, and neither is it a small thing to enlarge that tab by $320 simply for the sake of avoiding social discomfort. \n\nFrankly, you were far more generous than I'd have been in your situation, and I say this as somebody with many years of experience in the industry (back-of-house, from dish drone to kitchen manager; front-of-house, same deal). We don't really know enough about the situation to cast blame here, but I don't think it matters. After that kind of shitshow, I wouldn't have tipped anybody anything, wife and sister's disapproval notwithstanding.", "NTA, I don't know what happened to make people start thinking tips were owed and not earned but it has really screwed up a lot of dining experiences.", "Nta. The service wasn't that good, but even then, you still sent them a 160 dollar tip. I mean, isn't that enough.? Why is your wife and sister saying you \"made a scene\" it's no big deal. The service wasn't as good, so there was no need for that 20% gratuity. It's a win-win for everyone rather than a loss or a \"scene\"\n\nDefinitely NTA", "NTA.\n\nAuto tipping is worse than normal tipping, and that's saying a lot.", "NTA. As hard a pill as it is for people to swallow, lol, tipping is not a requirement.", "I was leaning towards ESH because it sounds like an all-around disaster, but I sure would love to hear the server\u2019s POV in this one.  In my experience, people that throw a fit about auto grat are overwhelmingly the ones that treat restaurant workers horribly. It\u2019s always been my dream to say to these people, \u201cWell, this is a bummer and I\u2019m so sorry, but let\u2019s be real, we all fuck up at work sometimes. Most often in ways that are out of our own control. How would you feel if random people said just horrible things to you and treated you like absolute shit? Oh, and also your pay will be docked for honest mistakes even tough you were open and genuine about potential hiccups?\u201d  \nYou know what, forget it.  \n\nYTA.", "Info: What country are you in?", "NTA having a concept of \u201ctips\u201d is emotional blackmail and you really not obligated to leave a tip.

Why didn\u2019t you have that $1600.00 tab altered? You know the wrong food, the wrong appetizers?", "Was in that business for years and was ready to go one way but NTA. Several issues with this experience. They were shorthanded and your server clearly had more than they could handle. Experience servers know that getting out drinks quickly can help cover for long time tickets from the kitchen and keep guests happier. Happier guest tend to tip better. Big issue with wrong appetizers and wrong entrees. That means either the server put in the wrong food on your ticket or the kitchen manager/chef/expo sent food to the wrong table. Management should have talked to you before dropping the bill and definitely should have discounted the bill or taken items off as compensation for the food issues.", "My issue with this is how can OP be so sure it was servers fault? \n\nI would have asked for the meals that were made wrong to be taken off or discounted before I took a tip away from a server", "YTA, maybe. There are a lot of things outside of a server\u2019s control. When you spoke to the manager you could have asked to have some of the food and drinks comped for the wrong orders and still leave the server a fair tip. Now if some of the problems you described were due to the server\u2019s mistakes than a lower gratuity was fair, though I would have gone to 15% as that is what (I believe) the IRS calculates tips to be.", "NTA- and honestly sounded like you handled this as maturely as possible. You didn\u2019t cause a scene or loudly complain. Seems like you spoke to the manager about a reasonable issue and they addressed it appropriately and then you also tipped afterwards. I\u2019m sure they were pleased you tipped at all.", "NTA. I wouldn't have tipped at all. They're lucky you didn't just walk out mid meal and not pay for your drinks.", "As a former server and someone with empathy, I say NTA.\n\nWhile You were warned about the situation before hand, you had the bad experience that was expected and maybe even then some, and still tipped 160. I didn't see anything in the post stating that you cursed out the server for this, in which case, if you did, I would change my answer to AH. But since you took it up with the manager (who should have posted a sign on the door or host stand warning patrons BEFORE they were seated) , and did not yell or berate the server, and were pretty passive DURING the bad experience, I would say NTA. \n\nI know everyone is different, so PLEASE do not tip based on what I am about to say, but I as a server, never looked at percentages, but the dollar amount and my bottom line at the end of the night. If I went home with 100 per day, that would have been 500-700 a week. So, if I had been your server, I would have been grateful. I know tip outs to host, busser, bar, and sometimes kitchen can take up a good amount of the days tips, but I do not believer that servers should be sharing their money with workers who should be making hourly.", "YTA, not for expecting better service, but for punishing the waitstaff. it is not the servers fault the restaurant is understaffed, which causes all sort of things to go wrong, so you shouldn't take out your frustration on them. it's not even worth it for servers to serve such a large group unless you tip 20%, since it takes time away that they could be serving other parties, though i doubt these waiters were worried about a lack of tables. what you should've done is paid the tip and left a bad review concerning the lack of staff so that (hopefully) the message would get back to whoever's in charge.", "Under the circumstances, your tip was generous.  \n\nYour wife and my sister-in-law seem to have been focused on the \"scene\" more than the tip.  These are two separate issues.", "NTA, But I would've paid the full tip. I guess I'm a sucker. I hate the thought of taking money out of people's pockets that they were expecting, especially since I planned on spending that much already. If I mess up stuff at work I get in trouble but I still get my full pay. Quite frankly, I hate tipping culture and wish it could end but it is what we have now. Once again, I know I'm a sucker.", "NTA and you are my hero.", "NTA. Automatic tipping is crazy. I\u2019m surprised you still left a decent tip anyways", "You had ONE server, 8 ppl, 3 rounds of drinks, appetizers, entrees, desserts, etc totaling $1600 worth of stuff. I am assuming that $1600 was a LOT of stuff because you said \"moderately fancy.\" You mentioned the bartender not being busy, but you are not judging that correctly if you are not factoring in the patrons at the bar, the other customers in the restaurant, togo orders and any extra work they are taking on due to the place being understaffed (which you were informed about by your server).    I get that this was a crap situation, and you are fully within your right to not tip well, but you went to a place with an automatic gratuity, stayed even when it was glaringly obvious they were struggling with staffing issues then when then asked for that to be removed, which only punishes the server. The server will still have to tip out anywhere from 5-20% of that $1600 whether they got a tip or not. So there is a good chance that server did the best they could with what they had available and will end up making nothing. Not only that but they lost those tables for 3 hours, and probably make around $2.50 an hour. There are multiple ways that situation could've been rectified by a manager to compensate you for the crap situation without punishing the server. So I would say you are NTA, but it would be really great if in the future you went to the manager much sooner so they have a shot at helping you before it's too late. I kind of want to find that whole staff and hug them. Understaffed restaurant shifts are mentally and physically exhausting. \n\n*Helpful tip for future situations! If a place is understaffed like that offer to split into two tables of 4. It's a much better situation for everyone!", "NTA. Automatic gratuity is bullshit. I tip what I tip, no one gets to tell me how much.", "Depends on whose mistakes they were? Server didn\u2019t ring in drinks? That\u2019s on them. Server rang the in the drinks, bartender took a long time make them because they weren\u2019t paying attention or weren\u2019t busy? Not on the server. Food runner/expediter didn\u2019t recheck the apps before sending them but the waiter fixed it? Not on the waiter. If the mistakes are on the waiter, NTA. If the mistakes are on other people and the waiter had no control? YTA. I work in a place where $1600 would be a LOT of work on whoever is running the table, I probably wouldn\u2019t have had many other tables or bar patrons (I serve, bartend, and manage) and if I gave as perfect of service as I could give them and there were things I couldn\u2019t control I would be pissed at a $160 tip. I know when I mess up and deserve less than 20%. I also know when service is spot on, above and beyond and people are just cheap AHs. I\u2019m going to also add it depends on your location. Some areas in the US get a $15/hour wage, in other countries tipping isn\u2019t customary, if I made that I might be more ok with 10%. I make $4 serving and $5 bartending. I bust my a$$ and average 23-25% on credit card tips. I\u2019m 48 and have been in the industry since I was 19. I love my job and am good at it. I deserve every penny I make but even I can say I had a bad moment and deserved a less than 20% tip. Those people are usually the most understanding and leave a really good tip because I fall all over myself to fix it. That was a book to say it depends on whose fault it landed on and how the server responded/fixed problems.", "YTA. Wait staff pay tax on your total bill because the gov can't always confirm total tips paid, so they tax on 10%. If the waiter is tipping out the other staff, which always happens (bartenders, food runners, etc), that server has to pay to serve you. The restaurant should have comped food and drinks. At the very least, the round that took a while. If a restaurant is shortstaffed, it's reasonable to assume a waiter is overstretched on tables. Like, did your waiter bring your food or runners, were the wrong orders put in, or was it another table's?", "YTA. Poor waiter was stressed the fuck out and couldn't help that the restaurant was understaffed. They probably tried their best. And you won't even pay them their wage.", "Automatic tipping is unfair to patrons.  The service industry has bottomed out as of late, and instead of giving raises to staff that actually show up, they pawn off the low pay to the customers.   And truly, being shortstaffed is not the customers doing and shouldn't be guilted into giving more than earned.", "YTA. You screwed the server and not the restaurant. The restaurant is the one who should have paid.", "I'm going with NTA. They have a lot of cheek adding an automatic gratuity when the service was that messed up. I get that they were understaffed but that's on the restaurant owner.", "NTA\n\nPERIOD. I don\u2019t give a fuck what a meal costs or how many people attend that meal. I work hard for my fucking money. When I don\u2019t do my job, I get fired. Gratuity is just that. You\u2019re not going to FORCE me to be gracious. Especially not to tune of 20% on a $1600 tab. Fuck that noise. Gratuity is earned. Not owed. \n\nI\u2019d have been livid to say the least. \n\nAlso, just because a place charges, for instance, $120 for a prime ribeye, versus another that charges $60, I\u2019m not leaving twice the tip because you charged twice as much. \n\nEven at $120 for a 3 hour meal (that should have taken 2), $40/hour for just that table, is beyond sufficient.", "Here in Australia a server in that kind of establishment would be paid 20 - 25$ an hour hence we ONLY tip if the service was good.  NTA in Aus\n\nEdit: however my wife just pointed out that if the OP caused an embarrassing situation just to save everyone 20 bucks each,  my opinion might change.", "Agreed. Even if the dinner from hell went on for 4 hours, that's $40/hour tip. At 3 hours, it's $50/hour.", "Literally, yes.", "This was probably their only table all night and most of this sounds like it was the restaurants fault. \n\nThe problem you run into here is nice restaurants usually have mandatory tip outs to other staff so if that 10% they likely saw 4-5% \n\nSo\u2026you\u2019re the asshole", "I mean.. why not. Sounds like they would have been better off at applebees.", "Agreed. This was on the manager for doing nothing!", "I'm in the hospitality industry and I think that a 20 percent autograt in this situation is preposterous. NTA OP", "Yeah, I can't believe some of these replies saying the OP is the AH.", "shit", "It used to be (not that long ago either) that standard tip was 15%, and 20% was extra extra good.", "I\u2019m not following your logic here. The food shouldn\u2019t have been brought by the server because it should be checked before they leave window. Even if some meals were taken off, it may not have dropped it low enough for OPs liking. \n\nNTA", "But the discounted food would have lowered the bill, and therefore the tip. \n\nWhat\u2019s the difference", "Also there is zero reason that a $200/head restaurant isn't paying their staff a reasonable wage.", "Being \u201cwarned ahead of time\u201d goes out the window when you get garbage service. \n\nSlow service due to understaffing is probably fair, and I wouldn\u2019t be *overly* upset about that, because that isn\u2019t really the servers\u2019 fault. They are only capable of moving/working so fast. *BUT*\u2026 repeatedly getting orders wrong is inexcusable. That\u2019s bad service, either way, and falls down to nothing other than poor memory or record keeping on behalf of the servers. 20% gratuity, especially at a higher end restaurant, implies a high level of service. OP did not get that.\n\nThis is coming from someone who generally tips north of 25%. I don\u2019t mind being generous, that 25% is my baseline - but I still want to receive what I paid for in terms of food and attentiveness.", "The only person who is suffering consequences is the servers and kitchen staff. The managers and owners aren\u2019t being harmed.", "No because the The restaurant still made their money The server who has no control over staffing is the one who gets screwed over.", "That doesn't account for tip out. \n\nYou think servers keep 100% of their tips? Hell no. They have to tip out and it's usually based on sales.", "When I was a server we had to tip out 5% of *sales* regardless of how much the tip was. Some places its as much as 10% to the bartender. This is why when you dont tip or barely tip, it often actually costs the server money to wait on you.", "Because it was the workers who got the orders wrong?", "How is it unfair?  Isn't that the point of a tip?  Great service gets you more money.", "This is the way it should have been handled.", "the best answer by far", "This was in the United States -- a 15-20% tip is customary and many restaurants automatically add a tip in that range for larger parties.", "Yes, though technically it was from my wife and I but I paid for it to celebrate her graduation.", "If this was an Applebees maybe I would agree. This person went to a high end restaurant. When you\u2019re spending $100 + a head, the service needs to be okay at best after a warning. Everything they ordered was wrong. Everything. Not just delayed, but wrong AND delayed. Way too expensive to make that many mistakes.", "Doesn't excuse the mistakes. One or two, sure. Not multiple, repeated fuck ups.", "Yeah, but the dishes being wrong was definitely at least partly on the server, as he should have known what they ordered. Apparently, he also forgot to put in the order for the drinks, so yeah, that was bad service from the waiter.", "Checking dishes before they leave the kitchen is definitely within the servers control.\n\nActually putting drinks orders into the bar is actually part of their job. \n\nMost of this could have been remedied by a competent server.", "What I came here to say. Your server let you know ahead of time that there may be issues (BIG point in their favor). How do you know incorrect food was delivered based on a server error, and not the kitchen? How is it your server's fault that the bar wasn't busy but drinks took a long time? Wrong dishes were corrected, yeah?\n\nI don't think any of this sounds like a reason to do your sever dirty. They let you know up front that there may be issues - which, granted, there were. BUT. A lot of those things may have been out of their control. Were they upfront, polite? Kept you updated on food/drink status, fixed any issues with food? Pre bussed?  Sent over the manager?\n\nSounds to me like they did the best they could with the cards they were dealt. At the end of the day it's just food and drinks. If your sever warned you ahead of time of possible issues but still took care of you to the best of their ability, I think it's baloney to leave a crap tip for issues outside of their direct control.", "Thank you for your reply.  I'm not trying to defend myself necessarily but when I pay at a mid-level restaurant, an Applebees, Chilis, Olive Garden, etc I ALWAYS tip 25-30+% regardless of quality of service FOR THE VERY REASONS you stated.  However, it's a bug in my ass at a more expensive place where one would expect for what one is paying both in food price and expected gratuity that you should have a reasonable expectation of service for what is decidedly automatically included and if not, ask that it be removed and decided by service that was provided.", "Thank you for your reply.  I'm not trying to insinuate that I'm special or our party was special.  However my point, and perhaps I'm not making it well enough, is that I would expect a different level of service from say Denny's to Applebee's to a higher-end restaurant commiserate with the cost of dining at such a place.  I'm not looking for above standard service, I'm looking for standard service at the price point.", "Why would you reward the waitstaff for horrible service? The waitstaff can bring correct food or check with back of the house so things come on time. Waitstaffs\u2019 only job is not to bring food, they should also make the process work seamlessly.", "Good points. A better alternative would have been if OP had asked the manager to comp some of the meal, such as the entrees that were wrong and a round of drinks, while still paying the 20% gratuity on a lower total.", "He had plenty of mercy. He tipped incompetent staff 10%.\n\nI'd have gotten a manager and cancelled the full order and walked out if every entre was wrong in a $200 a head restaurant.

The server for OP was probably getting paid between $7.25 and $9/hr, and probably needed to tip out 10% of drink sales to the bar, and 5% or more of food sales to the kitchen. It makes it so that if OP didn't tip, the server literally has to pay the bar and kitchen out of their own pocket.\n\nIf $500 of their $1600 bill was drinks, and the remaining $1100 was food, the server has to pay the bar $50 of their tips from the table, and $55 of their tips to the kitchen, but if the table didn't tip, that $105 comes out of the server's pocket, or previous other tips.

So I have seen a lot of similar replies in this thread, and I\u2019m going to replay here, but please know my response is directed at the argument, not at you personally.\n\nSo, two things out of the way to start:\n\n1) Tipping as a wage system is unethical and immoral. I will expand on these points if needed, but not in this comment.\n\n2) Tipping as wage is often mistakenly presented as an hourly expectation to match base wages. The truth is that wage tipping is most accurately defined as a fee for a service, or a commission. If this is not obvious I will happily explain this point as well, in another comment.\n\nNow, on to my objection to the argument that $160 for 4 hours worth of work should be enough ever/in this situation:\n\nFirst of all, that $160 doesn\u2019t cover the prep work servers get called in to come in early for when a restaurant is severely understaffed. It doesn\u2019t cover dishwashing, mopping, laundry (all of the extra labor ON TOP OF the side work expected of servers after their shift, that most certainly would have been required in a staffing fiasco like this one. \n\nThat $160 doesn\u2019t cover the costs or time of laundering the server\u2019s own uniforms. It doesn\u2019t cover the cost of uniforms themselves. (Even in restaurants that have allowances for this, it never covers anything close to the real cost of the shoes and clothes that are needed for serving in a restaurant, especially one like this where looks are important.)\n\nThat $160 doesn\u2019t cover the migraine medicine the server will need in three days after having pulled three days of double shifts to help what\u2019s left of their crew keep the doors open on a restaurant that is close to failing. (And for the sake of being really real, that server doesn\u2019t have migraine meds, because they don\u2019t have health care because they are a wage worker in a restaurant in the US. )\n\nThat $160 doesn\u2019t cover the PT that server will need in 6-10 years for repetitive stress injuries from the unique physical labor that is trying to serve people while looking graceful and acting kind. (And guess what, if they don\u2019t have health insurance by then, then the chronic nerve pain in their arms might just keep them from being able to finish the degree that would finally allow them to move out of restaurant work, yay!)\n\nThat $160 doesn\u2019t go into a 401k. It doesn\u2019t go into an education fund. It doesn\u2019t get matched in childcare allowances, or vacation pay or sick leave. \n\nSecondly, that $160 doesn\u2019t go home with the server. It gets divided up amongst the other wage-workers who contributed to that table\u2019s experience. (Let\u2019s just pretend this is not one of the toxic establishments that illegally requires servers to hand over tips to management in full to be distributed at their discretion.)\n\nLet\u2019s pretend for the sake of argument that the $160 is split evenly between one server and the kitchen. Just to help with the math. That leaves is with an assumed $80 in that server\u2019s pocket, a secondary payment for the cumulative labor that went into the service of that 4-hour meal. \n\nWhat the primary wage might be for that server is impossible to know, it varies so widely in the US. But let\u2019s just guess it\u2019s $10, again for the sake of easy math. Assuming a 10-hour shift (which I think is fair for this kind of restaurant with this severe of a staff shortage), and assume 3 hours of prep/side work (no service, no tip wage. Typically a place like this wouldn\u2019t overload a server with a big party, but being understaffed makes it hard to know. Let\u2019s just say they were doing an equivalent amount of service plus 50% for the entirety of their 7 hours of service. So, $210 in tip wages for those 7 hours. Add their base wages for the whole 10 hours, $100 (which of course would be less due to social security and taxes). That makes $310 for 10 hours worth of work.\n\n$310 hours for 10 hours of emotional labor combined with physical labor, and the knowledge that no one you serve that day will actually be happy with your work because the management/ownership refuses to give you the tools you need to make an true dining experience happen for them.\n\nHow many days in a row should a person be expected to work like that?
