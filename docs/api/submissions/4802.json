I'm a senior in high school and plan to go to college next year. My parents divorced when I was 11, I live with my mom and see my dad whenever I want to. My dad remarried a few years ago and he and his new wife have a baby that's a few months old. My mom is not remarried. \n\nSince this is my last Christmas at home, I've asked my parents if we can do Christmas the way we did it when I was a child, for nostalgia sakes. I'd like for my dad to come spend Christmas Eve with me, he can stay the night on the couch or air mattress, him and mom wake me up on the morning by singing carols and bringing me breakfast in bed then we spend all morning opening gifts, taking pictures, drinking cocoa, laughing and being a family. Then my dad makes brunch, my mom and I make cookies together, and after we visit my aunt and cousins on my mom's side where there's more gifts, pictures, cocoa and laughing, plus we play silly games all afternoon. My dad cooks dinner for everyone, we watch Christmas movies, play charades, then chill out until bed time when my parents would tuck me in and stay beside me until I fell asleep.\n\nMy mom said yes we can do this and she thinks it's a great idea to do since it's my last Christmas at home. When I asked my dad, he said he wasn't sure, because it's not fair to his wife and he doesn't want to miss the baby's first Christmas. My dad asked if he can invite his wife and baby, me and mom said no because they're not part of this. He asked if I'd be willing to split the day between mom and him, but I don't want to do that. Dad offered to come over to make breakfast and do the morning stuff and stay through brunch but that's only part of the day. I kept trying to explain to my dad how important this last Christmas is to me to spend it with him and mom, just us, doing it the way we did when I was little. My dad said he can't promise me the whole day and not spend anytime with his wife, baby, and his side of the family. He kept asking me to split the day and I kept saying no, that this is the only way I want Christmas to go this year. Now my dad and I aren't speaking and last I heard from him was a text saying he's mailing me my gifts and to contact him when I can be reasonable because my request is selfish and unrealistic. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671126723, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmrd77/aita_for_wanting_my_dad_to_choose_me_for_christmas/", "score": 666, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What you asked for? Was not only inappropriate but also very selfish. He has not one baby.. he has 2. He tried to work with you and also tried to be there for his wife and new baby. His wife was even willing to work with you, which not many would. \n\nBe thankful you are surrounded by people who love you and don't ruin this Christmas by living in the past.", "Oh, dear me.\n\nI really want you to hear me out, here. I understand why this is important to you. But I need you to really think about what you're asking for, and why. And I also really need you to think about why your dad has refused when your mom hasn't.\n\n>Since this is my last Christmas at home, I've asked my parents if we can do Christmas the way we did it when I was a child, for nostalgia sakes.\n\nIt's a sweet idea. The whole paragraph is a lovely picture. As an idea, there's nothing wrong with it. The asking is not the problem.\n\n>I kept trying to explain to my dad how important this last Christmas is to me to spend it with him and mom, just us, doing it the way we did when I was little.\n\nThis is the problem. And...\n\n>He kept asking me to split the day and I kept saying no, that this is the only way I want Christmas to go this year.\n\nThis is also the problem.\n\nYou have invested so much, emotionally, in this idea. In the process, you have convinced yourself that you should be more important and more special than your ~~step-family~~ step-mom and your brother. Your dad has offered you a compromise, but you are so invested in what *you want*, you aren't considering anything else.\n\nI'm sorry, but you don't get to do that. And you don't get to compare your mom and dad here, either.\n\n>My mom is not remarried.\n\nFor starters, your mom does not have a relationship and family to balance with yours. She doesn't have to consider the impact of her decision on anyone other than you and her. That makes it much easier, and virtually consequence-free, to say yes.\n\nBut she shouldn't have said yes. And at the very least, when your dad said no, she should have been on his side.\n\nBy being the one parent that agrees to this plan, your mom is doing you a huge disservice, because if she *had* remarried, she would likely feel the same way about excluding her husband and any of your ~~step-siblings~~ new siblings from Christmas with her. She should understand that, and help you process that it isn't going to happen.\n\nInstead, she is enabling your self-destructive behaviour, and what's worse, she's doing so in a way that makes her look like the good guy, and makes your dad out to be a bad guy. That's not fair.\n\nAnd when I say self-destructive behaviour, I mean it. This obsession with having a nostalgic childhood Christmas is sweet, and if you were able to accept reality and understand why it can't happen, there wouldn't be an issue.\n\nBut you can't, and it has led to serious damage to your relationship with your dad, and that isn't his fault. You are trying to turn back the clock, pretend for a day that nothing happened, and...well...it *did* happen. Your parents are divorced. You have a step-mom and a brand-new ~~step-~~ sibling. Whether or not that makes you happy, that's the way it is.\n\nI mean, look at this:\n\n>my dad makes brunch, my mom and I make cookies together, and after we visit my aunt and cousins on my mom's side where there's more gifts, pictures, cocoa and laughing, plus we play silly games all afternoon.\n\nThis is a nostalgic, happy memory for you, and while it probably is for your dad too, imagine how painful it would be to try to relive this, knowing how temporary it would be. Also imagine how awful your step-mom would feel if her husband asked if he could spend Christmas day pretending they never got married. I know that isn't technically what you're asking, but that's how it would feel.\n\nYou're asking your dad to, in essence, reopen some deep, deep wounds. You're asking him to put himself and your ~~step-family~~ step-mom and baby brother through hell.\n\n>it's not fair to his wife and he doesn't want to miss the baby's first Christmas.\n\nAnd really, this is an enormous - and frankly, inappropriate - ask. Like it or not, your new ~~step-~~ sibling is just as important in his life as you are. And on top of that, you're on the verge of adulthood. You are going to college. You are moving into an independent phase of your life. And you already lived full-time with your mom since the divorce.\n\nAnd to make things *so* much worse:\n\n>My dad asked if he can invite his wife and baby, me and mom said no  \n>  \n>Dad offered to come over to make breakfast and do the morning stuff and stay through brunch but that's only part of the day  \n>  \n>He kept asking me to split the day and I kept saying no\n\nThis breaks my heart, because despite that this whole thing is extraordinarily painful and your mom's behaviour is abhorrent, he is *trying so hard.* He is *trying* to find a way to give you time, just you and him and your mom playing house, and frankly, he does not have to do that. He would be well within his rights to absolutely refuse.\n\nBut he's trying. He wants to have a relationship with you. He *wants* you to be happy. And he's up against your mom, who seems to be doing everything she can to damage your relationship with him.\n\nAnd at the end of the day...\n\n>Now my dad and I aren't speaking and last I heard from him was a text saying he's mailing me my gifts and to contact him when I can be reasonable because my request is selfish and unrealistic.\n\nHe's right.\n\nYou moving out *is* a milestone. Your last Christmas at home is an emotional time that is leaving you extremely vulnerable. But you aren't dealing with that in a healthy way. And you are not understanding that your father's life *cannot revolve around you anymore*. He's still your dad, and you're still his daughter, but the only thing you gain by trying to compete with your ~~step-family~~ father's new family and live in the past is more pain. For everyone involved.\n\nIf you want to still have a dad at the end of all this, you have to move on.\n\n**YTA.**\n\n**EDIT:** Credit to u/WaywardMarauder for pointing out that I routinely mislabeled OP's new sibling as a step-sibling. I'm not operating on all cylinders today.", "I\u2019m FLOORED your dad even offered as much as he did. He has a new baby and is willing to go (alone) on Christmas Day to his ex\u2019s home to make breakfast and stay through brunch?? Honey, you have no idea how good you have it. I know it\u2019s not the same as when you were a kid and I\u2019m sorry that it hurts, but this is a really generous offer by your dad. You should take him up on that and thank him profusely, instead of insisting he spend the entire night and day with you and his ex without his wife and new baby. YTA.", "YTA and this is crazy selfish. My parents split up when I was a kid and while I miss my childhood Christmas, I'm a grown woman and I wouldn't put anybody through my whim when they emotionally moved on and this would be just torture for everyone involved. I find it weird your mum is fine with this, tbh. You should respect that your parents aren't together anymore and that your dad doesn't owe you to play this charade.", "YTA. If you don\u2019t go home for Christmas anymore, that\u2019s your choice.  You are practically an adult and harsh as it is\u2026mommy and daddy aren\u2019t together anymore and haven\u2019t been for some time. It\u2019s incredibly selfish of you to expect your father to choose between his children and play house with your mother so you can indulge in a childish fantasy.", "YTA. This is completely unreasonable to ask if a divorced couple. If your step mom and sibling were invited, that would be different. But you, your mom, and your dad and no longer a solo unit.", "YTA. This is selfish and unrealistic, as your dad says. \n\nYour mother is also a major AH because she knew damn well it was unreasonable and allowed you to ask anyway.", "YTA, your parents aren\u2019t together anymore. You\u2019re asking your father to disrespect his wife and youngest child because you\u2019re \u201cgrowing up\u201d. Compromise would be best in this situation, and he\u2019s clearly trying to do so", "YTA. You are trying to recreate a something that doesn't exist anymore", "YTA\n\nThis isn't your last Christmas, **you aren't dying** from what I understand.\n\nThis is his first Christmas with his wife and baby, you will always be important as his child but he can't neglect his other child and new born baby because you want a Christmas like when you were little. He has other responsibilities now besides you.\n\nIf he completely ignored you on Christmas and was with the baby would you be okay with that? When you were a new born would your mom be okay with your dad leaving for 2 days? Probably not. So accept it can't always be what you want and find a compromise, what he offered seems reasonable!", "This sounds incredibly tough, but I have to say - gently - that YTA a little bit in this situation. \n\nIf your dad had flat out said no, I would have said differently, but it sounds like he is doing everything he can to accommodate your request while fulfilling his responsibilities to his wife and new baby. \n\nPerhaps if you were a child, your parents and step-mom could have come up with a way to fulfil your request, but as you are an adult, try to understand that your dad is trying to be a good parent to both you and your half-sibling. \n\nIt might be worth considering why this is suddenly so important to you - could it be that you are jealous of your half-sibling? Your last Xmas at home isn\u2019t going to be your last with your parents - perhaps you could compromise by asking for your dream Xmas next year so that your family has more time to prepare? \n\nEither way, your dad is not choosing your half-sibling over you - he\u2019s actually found a really good compromise and you don\u2019t seem to recognise that at the moment. It sounds like outside of this, you have a great relationship with your parents - don\u2019t cause issues where there don\u2019t need to be any, OP.", "YTA - you are old enough your wants won't hurt you and time does not reverse for anyone.  Telling your dad to essentially abandon his new wife and baby (your mom has every right not want to spend Christmas with them) is childish and selfish.  Time to grow up and accept the changes in your life.  Your dad is quite right to refuse to indulge this angst of yours.", "YTA. You are projecting your desire for your family to be whole again onto your dad and his NEW FAMILY and that's not fair to him or them. You have to let go of the past because it's just that- the past. I'm surprised your mom was going along with this because it's really messed up to be asking your dad to choose between you and his family for a completely unreasonable request like that.", "YTA your request is pure insanity. Why do you think that you matter more than his other child? I\u2019m surprised your mother agreed unless she knew he\u2019d say no and just decided to go along with it anyway to not look like the bad guy.", "INFO: Won't you be coming home from college for the holidays? Also, is this even real?", "YTA. Are you kidding? He has a new family and you wanted him to blow them off? You're being selfish and unreasonable.", "YTA. He's right, your requests ARE selfish and unrealistic.", "Yta - Your dad has a wife and a new baby so you want him to give up spending time with your half sibling for all the focus on u?? If you want your cake and eat it too, then his family could\u2019ve come and join you and your mother not singling them out", "YTA for trying to take your and your half siblings father away completely on the baby\u2019s first Christmas. Seems like you are being selfish and immature. Half a day is just fine and you know it. You are driving a wedge here with your mother\u2019s help that doesn\u2019t need to exist.", "YTA dude..come on", "Sorry, YTA. A baby\u2019s first Christmas is very important to the parents, and he offered a very reasonable compromise in inviting his wife and baby. I understand wanting to have a \u201clast childhood Christmas\u201d but that doesn\u2019t necessitate excluding his other family.", "You act like your dying and this is your last Christmas ever, it's not and your expectations are completely unrealistic. Your 18 years old, not a child anymore time to stop acting like one. \n\nExpecting him to abandon his whole family and not celebrate with them at all is extremely selfish of you and makes YTA.", "YTA because you want to exclude his wife and other child. Ifeel bad for you but you could have done this before he had a new family.\n\nAlso, it is not you last Christmas at home unless you plan to never be home for Christmas again....", "YTA. You're putting your father in a no-win situation. He can't just abandon his wife and baby because you want to recreate old times. Things have changed. You have to accept that.", "YTA. You think it is reasonable to expect your dad to miss his baby's first Christmas so you can pretend to be a small child again? Your and your mom are at best, wildly entitled and at worst, delusional.", "YTA. Dude are you serious? You want him to abandon his family to cater to you?", "Also, many colleges close the dorms for winter break. I strongly suspect this is not your last Christmas at home.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your last christmas home unless you relocate to a different country. Even if you chose to stay at uni over christmas instead of using the time off they give you (because yes, they shut down at christmas, just like highschool!) chances are very high that you as an adult will still go home for christmas at some other point. You want you dad to miss the very first christmas of his baby, be away from his actual wife all of christmas, so you can make believe happy families. Let me tell you a little secret - just because you only remember good stuff does not mean your parents were getting along. They\u2019re divorced. It\u2019s very likely that every time you weren\u2019t in the room they were fighting, and that\u2019s how this would turn out too. Your dad would be on his phone the whole time with his wife and looking at pictures of his baby that she sends him. \nThose days are gone and trying to relieve them will only end in heartbreak. They\u2019re not going to get back together, and you no longer the only child.", "YTA. Sorry to be harsh...but... Get over yourself.  You CANNOT recreate the past.  Your parents are not married.  Why is your mom so keen on having your dad there..that seems strange to me.  You are a grown-up now.  Enjoy the morning with your dad.  You are wanting him to choose you over the 'new' kid.  Reeks of jealousy to me", "YTA.\n\nYou are asking him to abandon his other family for you, and he has a valid reason for not wanting to come since he wants to spend Christmas with his other family and kid now. \nHe asked you to come over with him, and you refused. \n\nIt does not all revolve around what you want to do.", "YTA.  Asking someone to spend Christmas away from their spouse and child is an asshole move.  No two ways about it.  How would you feel if your dad was the one proposing to spend the whole day with his wife and baby, and not invite you to any of it?", "YTA. There is so much wrong with what I just read I don't even know where to start. You are not a child anymore, start trying to force others to change their life completely so you can live in the past.", "YTA - Your dad is trying his best to give you as much of the Christmas that you want as he can, but you are refusing to compromise at all.  \n\nIt is unreasonable to expect him to leave his wife, new child and family for the entire 24 hours of Christmas to spend Christmas in his ex\u2019s home, even if it\u2019s with you.", "YTA, it's his baby's first christmas and he has a wife. He offered a compromise but instead of accepting it you chose to make your christmas even worse than it would have been", "Yta\n\nHe tried to compromise and you said no. Why should his wife and child be deprived of a loving moment so you can recreate a childhood memory. Also why is it your last Christmas, surely you can go home for the holidays and celebrate with your mum again.", "YTA It\u2019s not fair to ask your father to ditch his family on Christmas.  It was an unreasonable request, and you rejected every reasonable compromise he offered.", "YTA. It sounds like a lovely tradition, but it is not fair to ask that of your dad.  Yes he is your family, but he also has more family to spend time with.  It is completely unreasonable to ask him to completely neglect his wife and new baby on Christmas.  His compromise of half the day sounded perfectly reasonable, and I think you need to reach out to him and apologize and try to share Christmas.", "YTA. You are not a child anymore. Of course your mom is on board because she doesn't have anyone else. The fact your dad is trying to meet you half way and you still refuse shows how much YTA.", "YTA\n\nYour parents are no longer together and you can\u2019t possibly be expecting a new parent to entirely miss their baby\u2019s first Christmas.", "YTA you are 18 grow up.", "As must as I can relate to how you are feeling, YTA.\n\nYour dad sounds like he loves you very much, but you need to understand that he has a wife and another child at home.  He cannot missing the entirety of Christmas with them, that\u2019s not fair.\n\nYour dad is trying to compromise with you, please take him up on it.  He is trying to be a good dad to the both of you.", "yta. \n\nyour request IS selfish and unrealistic. \n\ni understand that growing up and leaving home can be scary and sad and sometimes you wish you could go back to when you were little when things seemed simpler because you knew less about the world. \n\npart of becoming an adult is understanding that you can\u2019t go back in time, that other people have wants and needs that are just as important as yours, and that sometimes you need to compromise. you have a sibling now that this is their first christmas. your dad presumably loves both his children equally and you have to learn to understand that you are not his only priority any more. if you want to have a relationship with him, find a way to spend time together that works for him too and isn\u2019t exclusively on your terms.", "YTA\n\nThis is an INSANE request.\n\nI understand why you want it, but it\u2019s completely unreasonable. You want your father to leave his wife and newborn baby, your sibling, alone ton Christmas, to cosplay as if your parents had never gotten divorced?\n\nI\u2019m sorry that your family situation is complicated, but this is not an appropriate way to try to handle your feelings.", "YTA - (if this is even real).  No one gets to turn back time.  It sounds like both your parents love and care about you, but you are asking your dad to forego spending time with your sibling as well.  This feels very selfish and childish.   At 18, you long for your mom and dad to tuck you in on Christmas night.  This just sounds so odd.  I am sorry that your family is not how it was when you were 11.  But you have a larger family now, with a new sibling.  If you want to celebrate, then include your whole family as it is now, or compromise with your dad.  Your request is selfish, unrealistic and immature.", "Yeah YTA\n\nsorry but your parents aren't together and there are more members of your family.\n\nif your parents had stayed together and had a kid recently, would you also have not invited your sibling cuz they weren't part of your childhood Christmases?", "YTA - Your father offered plenty of compromises. It's pretty self-centered of you to expect him to spend the day before and the full day of at your mom's place when he's got a wife and a child you're not willing to include in any way.", "Gently YTA. He's been trying to come to several compromises for you so that it can still be special for you. I can understand why he wouldn't want to miss his child's first Christmas. Part of becoming an adult is realizing not everything can go your way. I'd take what you can get instead of creating a bitter conflict", "YTA. You're putting your dad in a no-win situation. He either spends the entire day with you and your mom (his ex-wife) while neglecting his newborn child and current wife or he ruins your last Christmas at home.\n\nI come from a divorced family too and it sucks, I completely understand the desire to have one last \"perfect\" Christmas. The thing is, there is no going back, no matter how much we want to and forcing the issue has brought your relationship with him to a breaking point.\n\nYour dad clearly loves you but he also loves his newborn child too. You're asking him to choose between his children. That's not fair.", "YTA. Sucks that your parents divorced.  But you are 18, not 8.  Forcing them into this fantasyland holiday won't do anyone any good.  He can and should spend time with you during Xmas.  But sleep on his exes couch and play happy family?  Nope.", "YTA and super ridiculous. You're basically an adult, act like one and realize you have a new family with a new dynamic. If you can't process that seek therapy.\n\nHonestly this was super cringy to read. You're setting yourself up for disappointment for no reason. Things change, change with it.", "YTA. You can\u2019t go back. I\u2019m sorry but it doesn\u2019t work. Better to move forward.", "YTA am sorry but your being extremely unreasonable here your dad has a wife and baby he can't possibly not spend Christmas with them to tuck a 18 year old up in bed and sing carols all day. Your dad gave you a compromise you said no his wife and baby were not part of your family but they are part of his family", "INFO: Are you going to college in a different country? Why would this be your \"last Christmas at home\"? Most, if not all college, have winter break where all the students go home.

It's your halfsiblings first Christmas but who cares that isn't about OP", "YTA \n\nHe tried making compromises for you, but you just want your perfect little Christmas and don't care if his new wife and baby are left behind. Very selfish.", "YTA I think you have to understand that he has his own family outside of you. Obviously he would want to spend some of it with them and he made a pretty reasonable compromise. He\u2019d spend half the day with you and then with his wife and baby. I get that you\u2019d want it to be like old times and reminisce about those days but times have changed and the dynamic between your parents isn\u2019t like that anymore. It\u2019s unfortunate but I think that you should take him up on his offer. Maybe you can spend Christmas Eve with him. But I think that it\u2019s a bit unrealistic for you to expect him to drop his family, especially since he has a baby, and only be with you. \n\nAlso in college you get a month off for winter break. Surely you\u2019d be going back home no matter where you end up going?", "Sadly, YTA.\n\nTime doesn't go backward and unfortunately we can't ignore the reality of the present.\n\nYou can't expect your Dad to cut his new wife and child out of Christmas. At all. He also has a life and if your ignore that, you're ignoring a large part of who he has become. You're dismissing the stepmom and child altogether. If that's the kind of relationship you want with them, fine, but it will mean you lose your Dad.\n\nYour mom isn't particularly helpful here in that she should have made it clear to you it's a lovely idea but not realistic now.", "YTA and your mother is too.  She has the life experience to know this is an irrational ask on your part.  She should have guided you better instead of allowing this unreasonable expectation.", "yta", "YTA, and unless you go NC with your mom or a horrible tragedy befalls you, this isn't your last Christmas at home. You are going to college not to explore Mars.", "YTA\n\n You're 18, not 5. Your demand is ridiculous. Your father made a good point of him coming and doing the morning things.

What dad would want to miss their kids first Christmas? Be compromising; you're honestly lucky your mom said yes (I would have said HELL NO, divorce means things are different).

I'm a senior in high school and plan to go to college next year. My parents divorced when I was 11, I live with my mom and see my dad whenever I want to. My dad remarried a few years ago and he and his new wife have a baby that's a few months old. My mom is not remarried. \n\nSince this is my last Christmas at home, I've asked my parents if we can do Christmas the way we did it when I was a child, for nostalgia sakes. I'd like for my dad to come spend Christmas Eve with me, he can stay the night on the couch or air mattress, him and mom wake me up on the morning by singing carols and bringing me breakfast in bed then we spend all morning opening gifts, taking pictures, drinking cocoa, laughing and being a family. Then my dad makes brunch, my mom and I make cookies together, and after we visit my aunt and cousins on my mom's side where there's more gifts, pictures, cocoa and laughing, plus we play silly games all afternoon. My dad cooks dinner for everyone, we watch Christmas movies, play charades, then chill out until bed time when my parents would tuck me in and stay beside me until I fell asleep.\n\nMy mom said yes we can do this and she thinks it's a great idea to do since it's my last Christmas at home. When I asked my dad, he said he wasn't sure, because it's not fair to his wife and he doesn't want to miss the baby's first Christmas. My dad asked if he can invite his wife and baby, me and mom said no because they're not part of this. He asked if I'd be willing to split the day between mom and him, but I don't want to do that. Dad offered to come over to make breakfast and do the morning stuff and stay through brunch but that's only part of the day. I kept trying to explain to my dad how important this last Christmas is to me to spend it with him and mom, just us, doing it the way we did when I was little. My dad said he can't promise me the whole day and not spend anytime with his wife, baby, and his side of the family. He kept asking me to split the day and I kept saying no, that this is the only way I want Christmas to go this year. Now my dad and I aren't speaking and last I heard from him was a text saying he's mailing me my gifts and to contact him when I can be reasonable because my request is selfish and unrealistic. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Yta", "Are you a flipping baby. Your very selfish. And your never ever coming home for Christmas again?  YTA", "YTA.\n\n It was ridiculous to even ask for this. You want your divorced parents to pretend everything is back to when it was before? I\u2019d understand this if you were 10 but you\u2019re almost an adult here.\n\nI find it crazy your mom agreed to this. She either cant say no to you or wanted to score a win over the new wife/family. \n\nLast Christmas? Are you dying? It\u2019s not as if you\u2019re not allowed to spend Christmas with your family once you\u2019re 18\n\nAnd on top of all this you\u2019re selfish. Your dad can only spend the day with you? Not his new wife, his baby, his extended family? Nope, just you\n\nI\u2019d recommend growing up and acting responsibly before he walks out of your life forever", "YTA. I have divorced parents too but this is a little crazy. You need to move on.\n\nFirst, it\u2019s not your last Christmas with either of them. You\u2019re going to college, not war. You can visit during the holidays and as an adult.\n\nSecond, you\u2019re not a child anymore. It might be nostalgic but it\u2019s a little weird to expect your parents to treat you like a 6yr old.\n\nThird, you\u2019re seriously alright with excluding your half-sibling?? It\u2019s unreasonable to make your dad choose between his two kids. You\u2019re being too spoiled expecting him to leave his wife and child just to entertain you. If this is because you\u2019re sad about no longer being the only child then that\u2019s incredibly immature. You\u2019re legally an adult now and need to get over it. See a therapist if it\u2019s really bothering you that much.", "This is such a weird and elaborate request from an 18 year old and there is no awareness of others at all. As a parent I would imagine your kids first Christmas is way more special than their 18th.", "YTA. You should go to therapy OP, to work some of this out. I know you have fond memories of the time the three of you were a family, but things change, and you can't go back.\n\nWhat you can do is make good, fun, new memories and traditions with your new family, with new sibling. It's unfair of you to try to put them aside as a requirement for your ideal Christmas. And also, so unfair to put your dad in a situation to choose between two kids.", "NAH, you still human op, it's normal to want stuff that you feel like you missed out on when your parents got divorced so I can't really fault you for that. Sadly, the past won't come. Your dad has a new kid that needs him and you won't be his top priority anymore and that's ok. The same will also apply to you, one day you will be too busy with other things to make time for him. It's just life.", "NAH\n\nI\u2019m sorry honey but that reality doesn\u2019t exist anymore. Your parents split up and your dad has another child that he has to think of now. He can\u2019t pretend that the last 7 years haven\u2019t happened and you\u2019re old enough to realise that your life has changed from when you were a child. The traditions you describe would be painful for many divorced people to take part in. You need to think about your dad and his feelings, as well as your new step-mum and your half-sibling. You\u2019re an adult now, you need to change your mindset.", "ESH, but probably more on your end. You\u2019re 18. An adult. You\u2019re about to be living on your own. I understand you wish you could\u2019ve had mommy and daddy forever. And that\u2019s every child\u2019s birthright. But it\u2019s not like that. Your parents aren\u2019t married anymore and you\u2019re not really a family like that.\n\nIt\u2019s very unreasonable to ask your dad to abandon his wife and new child on any Christmas, much less their the first one.  I thought you were going to say that his new wife objected, but surprisingly she didn\u2019t. It\u2019s too bad your mom won\u2019t let her and the baby come over but it\u2019s also understandable.\n\nYou had however many Christmases with your mom and dad growing up and now you have a different reality.", "YTA - I understand why you want this, I do but you are asking him to forget his other family just for you.  There are compromises to be made here, and that is something you need to learn now since you are an adult (Should have learned earlier but whatever).  You asking for the WHOLE day, not the morning only, not the afternoon only BUT the WHOLE day.  I think your dad was super reasonable with his compromise.", "I hate to say this, but YTA. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry your parents split up. I\u2019m sorry this is so hard for you. Your dad can\u2019t leave his new wife and baby alone on Christmas. Please reconsider one of his compromises for Christmas.", "Oh my God. I know some young people hate adulting, but since when did they start hate teening? You are an adult. Act like it. I know you're butt hurt that mommy and daddy got divorced and it arrested your development but get over it. It just makes YTA.", "YTA, and so is your mother.  She KNEW or should have known that this would not fly with your dad.  Yet she said yes to make him the bad guy.  He's offering comprises and your mom says no.  Do you *really* think she wants to spend Christmas with her ex or is it just a way to stick it to him?\n\nYour expectations are completely unreasonable and for someone who is about to go off to university you seem to lack the maturity to grasp why.  You should thank your dad for offering comprises and apologize for putting him in that spot.  You need to forget about the picture perfect Christmas you dream of because your parents aren't married and you are not the center of the universe", "YTA\n\nYour dad sounds like a great guy and is willing to compromise and give you part of the day making breakfast and staying through brunch to recreate some childhood memories for you - and you keep turning him down.\n\nI understand ( as a child of divorce myself) wanting to hold on to and wishing that things could go back to the way they were but, unfortunatly, that can not happen. Your dad has a wife and a new baby - your half sibling- in his life too and asking him to ignore all of that to appease you is, frankly, not fair to him.\n\nTake your dad up on his offer or have your dad all day by allowing his wife and your half sibling to come along. Otherwise you are being selfish and completly unreaslistic.", "YTA he has two kids, you want him to to totally miss one kids first so you can have him all day? You\u2019re also not dying or anything, you will likely have more christmases with your family. Your request is unrealistic and selfish, you put in a request he tried to compromise, you refused, so now you\u2019re not getting anything. My parents were divorced too, I get it, it\u2019s hard, but expecting him to drop his other kid to live out some fantasy you have is really weird and a big ask", "YTA honey, things are never going to be the way they used to be.", "This is either fake, or OP is relatively immature. On the chance that it's real, I'm going with a gentle YTA.\n\nOP, I understand why you want a special Christmas before taking a big step into adulthood, but it sounds like you're being told No, and refusing to accept it, which is childish. It's not fair of you to exclude your new sibling (yes, that's your brother or sister, not just 'a baby') and stepmom from your holidays just so you can relive a fantasy of what life was like before your parents split up. You have a really beautiful memory of what those years were like, but maybe just keep it as a memory. Guilting people to participate in the way you want is already making it impossible for you to have the time you want.\n\nThink about it this way: how would you feel if your dad's wife demanded that he spend the entire holiday with her and the baby, and not see you at all? It's Baby's First Christmas, after all. I'd imagine you'd be devastated and hurt. By the same token, you're asking your dad to hurt someone else that way.\n\nYou're about to leave home and start adulthood. It's time to start acting like it.", "You're not the asshole for asking, but YTA for not compromising when he didn't agree 100%.  It was a nice dream to relive your past happy days, but not many of us can really go back, even if our parents didn't get divorced!", "I\u2019m also sorry to burst your bubble but YTA. I get wanting to spend the holiday with both of them, I really do because my parents are divorced too. However your dad does have other considerations now with a wife and baby, and he\u2019s trying to balance those by offering you a more than reasonable compromise. I think it\u2019s time to accept reality as an adult now and accept his offer to come back and spend part of the day with you and your mom, because he\u2019s right: you\u2019re being selfish and unrealistic in this new reality.", "I was reading such a great comment responding to this and it disappeared. I hope it's still their and OP sees it bc it addressed soany issues with 1) OP self destructive behavior in this and moms assistance in this disturbing behavior and not supporting who seems to be an amazing dad.\n\nYTA op. For the ask and the reaction. Your dad gave so many awesome suggestions, number 1 being, let's do this all together. You have a sibling now, learn to love them. How fun would that Christmas be with your whole family! And that baby is your family. Your dad sounds amazing, you have hurt your relationship with him over your selfishness. You need to mend this and remember what Christmas is about (hint:it's not about YOU)", "YTA. If you mom was remarried would you expect her husband to go away for the day.  This is not fair to your stepmother and sibling.  I'm a child of divorce. It sucks.  But you have to work with what you have. Your mom is agreeing with you because this really didn't affect her negatively. Your dad is really stuck. And unless you are planning on staying at college during your winter break this is not your last Christmas at home.   Be an adult and realize how this is not going to happen.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re 18 years old, you\u2019re about to start your first steps at being an independent adult, you absolutely know that you\u2019re being unreasonable and given how you\u2019ve refused absolutely any attempt of a compromise you\u2019re doing it on purpose to be spiteful towards a woman who (based on the timelines) had no impact on your parent\u2019s divorce and an entirely innocent baby.\n\nThink deeply about your behaviour here, because it really won\u2019t carry you well into the next stage of your life!", "YTA.\n\nIt is super selfish and unrealistic. Sure, the memory was great, but there is a reason it stays a memory. He's willing to compromise and you need to take him up on that.", "YTA We get it you want a special Christmas. But this is also a special Christmas for your stepmom and the new baby- yes the baby won't remember this Christmas, but it's still the baby's first Christmas.\n\nYour dad has offered you several reasonable options. Baby sibling and Stepmom join you guys. Dad splits the day between both households. Those are reasonable options.\n\nBut reasonable isn't- pretending for a day like your parents never got divorced and insisting that dad's new wife and your half-sibling join in on the game.\n\nAnd this isn't your last Christmas at home- unless you are going to the only college on the planet that isn't closed for Christmas. You have plenty more Christmases at more- they just might not be when you are a \"kid\" and feel like you can make crazy requests to your mom. (Your dad already knows clearly how to say no to the insane requests. At least at some point- clearly not always because you made the request.)\n\nHome isn't a house. Home is your family. It's the people you love. I get that right now this isn't easy to understand but I promise it's true. (My parents sold the house I grew up in when I left for college and you want to know what- every place they've lived since has still felt like home. Whether I've had a room there or not. My family is what makes the place home. Not the house. Not the stuff. The people.)", "YTA, as a fellow child of divorce my jaw dropped that you expect your dad to completely ignore his wife and your baby sibling on Christmas. The entitlement is far too much. Your dad is being generous by offering to come over to your moms and make you breakfast. If you really wanted to spend Christmas with both your parents you also need to compromise and allow step mom and baby sibling to attend. Not to mention, a baby\u2019s first Christmas is far more important than your 18th.", "YTA. Your parents are divorced. You will never have the same feeling you did as a child. Your father has moved on and has a wife and baby, you need to respect that instead of acting like they don't exist. This is an incredibly selfish thing to ask and your mother should never have agreed to it. It seems that she may not have ever moved on from their divorce either. You can't force your dad to pretend he is happily married to your mother and that you are his only child. Time to get some therapy to understand life has changed and it will never be what it was for you and very possibly your mother.", "YTA I am so sorry to say, I hate saying it as I understand what you want.\n\nYour dad can\u2019t just drop his wife and baby for a whole day it isn\u2019t fair on them either. \nTry and compromise a split of the day don\u2019t fall out over this. X", "YTA. I get it. I do. My parents divorced when I was 10 and it was a big adjustment during the holidays. But this is just too big of an ask for him. You should be mature enough to know that this is selfish on a whole other level. He\u2019s remarried with a baby and it\u2019s the baby\u2019s first Christmas. I think his solution to you is very reasonable, and I get that you want to feel the nostalgia for your christmases prior, but I\u2019m sorry to say that it just won\u2019t happen. \n\nHe\u2019s tried coming up with another solution, but you just won\u2019t take it.

What rule did she break?\n\nFinally, he\u2019s absolutely entitled to tell her how he feels about her actions. That doesn\u2019t mean he needs to cut her off and mail her gifts. You need to learn that you can be firm and still be loving. It\u2019s easy to be angry and just put the packages in the mail rather than being an adult, controlling your emotions and still showing love to your child in person. \n\nIt has nothing to do with pandering to them or giving into their demands. And it also sets a good example.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing stopping him from showing up, handing her gifts over, giving her a hug and a kiss and saying \u201cI know we are not getting along right now, but I still love you. Merry Christmas.\u201c \n\nAnd then leaving.", ">He kept asking me to split the day and I kept saying no, that this is the only way I want Christmas to go this year.\n\nTantrum. Even after being offered multiple options and explained that he cannot promise her what she wants she continues to keep saying no and making it ALL about her.\n\nHow is it not his job as her parent to give consequences? She by law is an adult, but is clearly not acting it and living with him or not does not impact that. He is her parent.\n\nYou don't have to have rules in place previously to provide consequences to current actions. She refused to listen to anything he had to say, dad got frustrated with it and set an boundary. It's healthy to set boundaries. What dad is doing is basically akin to putting a child in a time out and saying to them \"Take some time to calm down\". As I said before, he did not say he's not speaking to her anymore, just that he's not right now UNTIL she can be more reasonable. \n\nYou're right, there is nothing stopping him, but let's also consider how this made dad feel. Perhaps he doesn't want to be manipulated into staying if he does go over there. Perhaps there are large issues at play, given OP's reaction and answers to other questions, and dad needs to distance himself a little bit. Perhaps seeing her would be painful for him given how she reacted to the idea of including his wife and baby.\n\nThere are many factors to consider and dad has to protect himself as well. That does not mean that he doesn't love his child.", "Sometimes the hardest thing to do with an unreasonable person is to not engage with them. Do you think OP would be reasonable in your suggested scenario? Or would she demand he stay just a little longer, that he make some breakfast, well now he might as well stay for lunch.

Despite your demands, your dad has offered not only reasonable but generous compromises - splitting the day, having your step mum and half sibling join in so you can all spend Christmas together. I get that this is a significant Christmas for you, but your brother's first Christmas is also significant, and expecting your dad to spend the whole Christmas period away from him to play house with your mum is not an appropriate thing to ask. Your dad is trying so hard to make you happy a d your response is to throw that in his face and try to trash your relationship with him.

I am a bit surprised that you asked your parents to recreate a Christmas from when you were a (very young) child. I am assuming it is because that is how Christmas was at the time of the divorce. You seem to not have moved on emotionally from that time. Most 18-year-olds would find the Christmas you describe as the most cringy thing ever. I'm much older and it made me cringe to read it. Most people your age would rather the earth swallow them up whole than to spend Christmas as they did as a young child. \n\nYou can't know this from experience, but Christmas didn't change for your family just because of divorce. As children move into the teen years, they seek more time with peers and they desire to put aside the ways of their childhood. Eventually they want to return to these traditions, but in a more grown-up way. \n\nYou were an only child and now you are not. That is an important transition. An emotionally healthy response to this situation as the adult you now are would be to try and make Christmas special for the actual child in the family--your baby sibling.

You want them to pretend they never got divorced, pretend they are still a happy couple celebrating Christmas like in the old days, pretend your father never got remarried and that your stepmother and her baby don't exist.  You want your father to abandon your sibling for Christmas. You also want your family to get in on the pretending, when you bring cookies to them\n\nEven IF they all did this, it would be painfully awkward, and may I say cringy. No one would be able to keep up the act the whole day, and the laughter would be stilted. Your breakfast in bed with your loving parents looking on would be uncomfortable at best.\n\nSo you'd get everything you thought you wanted but it wouldn't be right, and you'd be disappointed that it wasn't the joyful day you wanted. So you'd look for someone to blame. Maybe your mom had some sad feelings or your dad texted his wife and talked to his baby on video chat. Maybe one of your uncles or cousins mentions how weird it all is.\n\nPart of growing up is realising that things will never be exactly the way they used to be. My parents are both gone and I live 6000 miles away from my family. My brother became a Jehovah's Witness so I will never have another Christmas at home the way it used to be. But I have my husband's family. We have made new traditions together. This year for the first time, I will put candles in the cemetery for both my parents and then go to my in-laws' to have Christmas food and enjoy our new traditions.\n\nWhat you should probably do, is try to start new traditions with both your families, so that when you come home from college you can look forward to Christmas the way it IS, rather than the way you wish it could go back to being.", "You need therapy.

Because you\u2019re forcing together an image of a family, and that image is fixed in the past.

But you are 18 years old. You have to have some understanding that what you are asking for is not realistic. Honestly, this reads as you acting out because you have a new sibling and you don't want to share your dad. You want to control what he's doing and how dare he do Christmas things with the new baby.\n\nThis is a HUGE ask if your father who has remarried and has a new baby who is your half sibling. Your parents have been divorced for 7 years and while your mother hasn't remarried, your father has and his family circumstances have changed. You can't ignore that.

You are trying to push for a recreation of something from your childhood that will never happen again because things have changed. Just as things will always change in families.

I had a 'last Christmas' before I literally left the country knowing that I'd probably not ever be able to afford to travel back at Christmas time (I visit other times of year). At no point did I even consider asking that my parents recreate my childhood Christmas experience. I wasn't going to do that to my parents, my dad's partner, or my youngest sibling.   \n\n\nLook, I get it. Being the child of divorce sucks in a lot of ways. But also, you have a new baby sibling in your life that you could be bonding with, and that could be really special. If you truly love your parents and your family, and want to act like the adult you now are, you will find a way to spend Christmas that works for everyone. At some point you are going to have to find new traditions, new ways to celebrate, where everyone can feel included - and yes, sometimes that means you have to compromise and not get *exactly* what you want. Your dad already was compromising way more than I think he should have to here. Like, I can't even get my dad's new partner to *meet* my mom - even on my *wedding day -* so the fact that they were willing to join in is amazing to me and I really think you need to recognise the fact that they were willing to do something that would likely be very uncomfortable for all of them, just to make you happy.  \n\n\nYou are clearly hurting, and have some stuff that you need to work through - ideally with a therapist, but unfortunately YTA here. I think you should apologise to your dad, and his partner, and figure out a different way to celebrate. Also, your mom is also TA for", "Sorry but, YTA.

Time to grow up and realize that the world doesn't revolve around you.", "If you were trying to include your new baby brother and his mother in this event,  and all parents involved could get along?

You're trying to take all of your dad's time from his new family,  refusing to share him, refusing to include them.  You're kind of acting like a petulant 5 y/o, tbh. YTA. without a doubt.  But your mom is, too, for allowing you to try to steamroll your dad with this farce. Your mom's got nothing to lose in this,  no one's feelings hurt,  no spouse or additional child being excluded.  So setting your dad up to be the bad guy (he's not) in this,  was kind of a dick move.", "YTA. I\u2019m not gonna sugarcoat this: we don\u2019t always get what we want in life. Your dad is trying very hard to compromise, but you\u2019re not budging.\n\nHe has other obligations, and as much as you don\u2019t want to hear this: you have another sibling now.

You're 18, grow tf up.\n\nAnd your mum? Agreed to the stupid idea you have of your family being back together for a day? Why? Because she hasn't moved on I assume. Refusing to include the rest of your _family_ stepmum and sibling is very smelly on her part and reeks of her not accepting that the family unit has changed. Like it or not they are now family to you. You don't have to like it, but you don't get to change it and rewind the clock on false pretenses like you're trying to.\n\nGet over yourself.

I never had a Christmas like that with my family! \n\nWould you even want all this if the new baby was not in the picture?

The aunt wants this at her house? How weird will it be to go to sleep as a grown person with 2 adults right next to you (who have been forced into this?). The new wife gets to be alone while all this is happening? \n\nDad offered a reasonable solution. Half a day (the first half at that) is more than generous.

That new baby is also your sibling, and family. I think you should really consider what\u2019s important here, getting to spend Christmas with your family and have it be a special day, or hurting your father, stepmom, and brother. Because either way, they are going to get hurt here. I get that you will feel hurt because this is what you\u2019ve dreamed up and want, but you\u2019ve got to see that this is truly unfair and what you\u2019re asking him to do is almost cruel. Why don\u2019t you see if you, your mom, dad, stepmom, and brother can do Christmas together. Still make it special. Still incorporate some of those things that you did traditionally, but use this milestone to make new traditions with your family that simply looks different than it did when you were young. I know you\u2019re young and this feels like a big deal and you feel hurt not getting what you want, but when you look back on this when you\u2019re older, you\u2019ll see what\u2019s most important here and that included compromising. If you do not compromise, your father will either do what you\u2019ve asked or not. If he does, you will probably feel guilt and regret later in life and it could cause problems in his new relationship and with your new sibling and his relationship with your dad. Or, he doesn\u2019t, and you don\u2019t get to spend your last Christmas with him at all. Either way, you will not come out happy in the end and are potentially setting yourself and others you care about up for hurt. Please reconsider compromising some how.", "YTA. I understand that you want to go back in time to before they divorced, but you can\u2019t. They are not married anymore, and he has a wife and baby who also need him. \n\nHe\u2019s tried to make compromises, but you\u2019re throwing a tantrum and making this all about you and what you want.

Your father has a new baby. You can't expect your father to miss his baby's first Christmas. This isn't your last Christmas.

I understand why you would want to do this but you can't expect your dad to give up a whole day when he has his wife, your baby sibling and his side of the family also.

There is a woman amidst this who is postpartum with a few month old baby. You are essentially demanding she be left on her own the whole day with her baby so that you can get a nostalgia kick. That IS selfish. Your Dad has offered two very fair compromises; invite them, or split the day. Asking him to entirely miss his baby\u2019s first Christmas is cruel. Splitting the day is fair. You might not think of the baby as your sibling. But you need to accept the reality that it\u2019s his baby. What you are asking for is rather cruel and I\u2019d be taking the same stance as your Dad.", "Yta, why wouldn't you want to share this with your new brother? I understand recreating the memories of your childhood although the level of detail you want them to go to is a bit much imo.

The compromises your dad suggested seem more than fair, why try go back in time when you have a good situation now?", "Soft YTA\n\nYou want your dad to abandon his very real family on Christmas to play pretend for you.\n\nPerhaps a better use of Christmas would be trying to make things good between the two families, not alienating your dad\u2019s wife and baby.", "Sorry, but YTA. You\u2019re 18, therefore you\u2019re an adult. Surely you must recognise that asking your dad to completely discard his wife & child, to play fake happy families with you and your mum is unrealistic?

There are so many aspects your father tried to offer you but you refused. Your mother is wrong too, she CANNOT say yes to how her ex spends his day.\n\nMaybe your mother wants to pretend that she's married again for a day, but your father is literally actually married.\n\nBringing his wife and kid is a good idea, u get your evening with him, and he can wake you up.", "Yta..gently... you are being selfish and unrealistic.

Unfortunately, things change. Most of us wish we could relive our best childhood moments but that isn't the reality of the world. You need to accept that and enjoy what new experiences, new christmases you will get to experience and let go of those old memories, as sweet as they are. Be grateful you have those memories, and now create new ones isntead of chasing them endlessly. Even if you were to do all your same traditions now, I promise it won't feel the same. That past is gone. And it's unfair to your father's wife and your brother to do this.", "YTA.  How selfish and insufferable.  You\u2019re 18, not 8.  Act like it.

I understand this, but it just isn\u2019t reasonable.  \nI feel for you, I really do, you have stopped being an only child just before leaving for college, it is a difficult change and a lot to handle, you want reassurance that your Dad is still going to be there for you - but this is just too much to ask, and it would probably be really unhealthy for you to act like you are 10 years back in time at Christmas.   \nIf I were you I would jump at your Dad\u2019s compromise, I have spent two Christmas dinners (with one Christmas morning) with my Dad since he remarried,  I am 28 and he remarried when I was 4 or 5, life is difficult for some things once your parents divorce, it sucks, but unfortunately you need to learn to adapt to it, I still have issues with it and I\u2019m 28, but things are better and therapy has helped.  \nIt really feels to me like your Dad is being more than reasonable and wants to make you happy, take whichever compromise you like best, don\u2019t hurt your relationship with your Dad over this.  \nI highly recommend you see a counsellor to talk over your feelings", "YTA because those christmasses are gone. It might be important to you, but your parents lives have moved on to the point where they can\u2019t pretend to be together for the sake of you reliving past memories.\n\nAs a result of your insistence, your Christmas will be very far from this unrealistic ideal, and that\u2019s your own fault.", "YTA. You are not compromising at all here and your dad tried so hard to make it work. \n\nBased on your post, it sounds a bit like you are used to getting things your way. Maybe you have never learned how to deal with this kind of situation?\n\nAlso, this is not your last chance to celebrate Christmas the way you like.

As a mom who has split up with her husband I want to do everything I can to make them happy and make things normal for them. But I wouldn't do this. First of all we split for a reason. And him staying over night would be awkward. We split for hurtful reasons and I don't want to pretend everything is normal. Mentally it would hurt. Absolutely I try to do joint birthday celebrations and I wouldn't mind him coming over Christmas morning for Santa and stuff. But staying over night and him going to my family's functions would be too much. \n\nI am also a kid of divorced parents so I get it. And you want \"normal\" but this is normal now and you do have to accept that to some degree. He's also right that it's not fair to entirely miss the new baby's first Christmas. The baby is innocent in all this. Like I said I am sympathetic to your feelings. But I think you are being a bit unfair to your dad.  How do you think his new wife would feel having him sleep over at his ex wife's house and not be around at all for their child's first Christmas. Your dad made some pretty good compromises to give you some of the old traditions while still being fair to his new wife. You have to be willing to compromise.

The age difference makes it a very different dynamic, but this kid is probably going to be in her life forever, especially if she has extended family on her dad's side.", "Not only that but from the scenario she describes she's had plenty of perfect christmas'. Why does she need another 7 years later? My guess dad has a baby now and she is jealous.", "This isn't even an acceptable request at 8,and the child would be sat down and gently explained to that this isn't the family is anymore, OP refuses to accept reality and is most likely jealous of the new baby. Gross.", "Happy cake day.", "Suspecting the mother is the prime AH here, using the daughter -with her immature but understandable desire to have happy family Christmas- as a pawn, to disrupt dad and new wife\u2019s marriage and assert manipulative control of dad.", "But she\u2019ll be a visitor then. And that just wont do", "Every generation has people that make unreasonable demands and at ages where far more maturity should be expected than at 18.", "The mom also refusing to let the new wife and half-sister be part of the event was really cruel. The whole thing talks about the MOM's side of the family, but then absolutely ignores and dismisses the Dad.\n\nDoubtful HIS wife is going to appreciate or allow him to spend Christmas Eve at his ex's house when she's literally giving a finger to his new family. \n\nSeems to be some jealousy and petty drama games getting played out. Dad seems like he honestly was trying to give a reasonable compromise", "She lost me with the air mattress, just got worse with the Christmas Carols and breakfast in bed, and I completely checked out when she asked him and her mom to tuck her into bed amd wait there until she fell asleep. That's just kinds creepers right there.", "Yep, this is pretty much my take as well. The top comment is much sweeter and more compassionate to OP than I would be. \n\nMy parents have been divorced since I was five, my dad remarried when I was six (to someone I do not get along with at all, btw) and had a new baby by the time I was eight. At 8 years old, let alone 18, I was definitely already in a place to realize how utterly absurd it would be to ask for a family reunion like this. I know OP was a bit older when her parents got divorced, but it's still been 7 years which is plenty of time for her to accept the new reality. I'm shocked her mom even said yes. \n\nI wonder how she'd feel rereading this post in 10 years and remembering what she asked for and how she refused all the compromises her dad put forward. I hope she'd have the grace to be embarrassed,  looking back on this as an adult. \n\nYTA OP.", "I just kept thinking, \u201cThis girl is way too old to be asking for something like this. She\u2019s old enough to know, even subconsciously, how wrong this request is given her dad has a new wife and baby who also need his time.\u201d Her parents have also been divorced for about 7 years. That\u2019s more than enough time to accept the reality of the situation. \n\nI\u2019m gonna be an AH here and not treat OP with the kid-gloves that everyone else is using:\n\nOP, it\u2019s time to grow up. Put your big-girl panties on, accept reality, and take your father up on one of his generous compromises. Right now, YTA, but it doesn\u2019t have to stay that way. It\u2019s in your power to make a better choice.", "I agree about the mom.  If this is real the OP is TA but clearly has some serious issues, the mom is definitely TA because it's cruel to encourage creating a delusional Christmas.", ">It\u2019s pretty fucked that her mom would encourage this.\n\nI understand an 18 year old still being in a place where this might seem ok, but what the heck is with her mother saying \"yeah, sounds great!\" -- that's extremely messed up.", "Yes! Perfectly and elegantly put. Also, phrased much kinder than  I expected to see from the responses!", "That part broke my heart. My child has never asked for a Christmas like we used to have, where his parents were still married and everyone was happy, and cousins came over and we watched holiday movies or video games all day. If he ever did, I have no idea how I would pull that off. The fact is, it would only benefit our child. It doesn\u2019t  change any of the dynamics that led to his parents getting divorced, nor does it make us feel fonder for each other. And that\u2019s without considering our partners and families who would also want to spend time with us in those new dynamics. I would absolutely sit him down and explain why it wouldn\u2019t happen, and honestly it would tear me apart to do so. I hope OP can understand where her father is coming from when he tries to compromise.", "Those christmas' are full of wonderful memories for the daughter - but who knows when the problems started with MOm and Dad - those times could have been truly difficult and unhappy for each or both of them - why put someone you love thru that.", "I immediately thought of this expression:\n\n>Proverb\n\n>you can't go home again\n\n>Past times which are fondly remembered are irrecoverably in the past and cannot be relived.\n\nOP is setting themself up for disappointment by trying to recreate times from before the divorce/ childhood.", "i was thinking this too. even when christmas comes around and they\u2019re away at college.. usually schools close before christmas so it\u2019s not like they will never have another christmas at home again.", "I'm in my mid thirties. My partner is in his late 30s. He's missed ONE Xmas at home in all his 38 years. ONE. And that's because we live abroad and 2020 had certain.... restrictions. One single one. We're booked to go home next week again to his home to do it. His 50+ yo sister (who has lived abroad 30+ years) is already home for Xmas to help set up decorations. She's missed a few more but she also has in laws to juggle with. I don't have much of a family so we're in a more obvious position. You are able to come home even from abroad for Xmas.", "Right?  Not like at 18 you are granted a home of your own rather than just going away to college.", "That part. OP has such a huge emotional connection to her family and Christmas and yet she never wants to come back home for Christmas? What is holding her back? I grew up in a separated, but strong family where I would never think of not visiting for Christmas, despite traveling and having to split the days. Christmas as an adult can never be like your childhood, but it's precious time well spent nonetheless.", "Possibly OP is trying to use this \u201clast Christmas at home!\u201d as a way to get validation that she\u2019s still important to her father, despite the birth of his new baby. She\u2019s insecure about being replaced by his new family, and she wants to make him show she comes first. As outlined above, what she\u2019s doing is instead destructive.", "But also, at 18, I didn\u2019t want Christmas with my family, I wanted all of that little kid fun stuff with a family of my own.  Where I\u2019m a parent and I get to make the magic!\n\nHell, when I moved out my roommates and my pets all got to have the magic.  That was more fun for me than hanging out with my parents, lol", "That is what I fear, too, that even if dad was actually there, it would probably fail to live up to OP's expectations. Your parents both love you, but their relationship isn't what it once was, and that is bound to alter things.", "I believe that could be partially true, but I feel that OP is worried she is being replaced. Dad is remarried and now has another child. After being an only child for so long I am concerned that OP is worried about losing that place. I feel dad is doing all he can to show that\u2019s not true. He offered compromises and was willing to even do half of Christmas Day with OP. Dad was willing to spend more time if his wife and child could come but OP shut that down immediately. I think this is more of \u201cI want to go back to be the sole focus of both of you\u201d rather than let\u2019s make some odd attempt at pretending we\u2019re still one happy family. OP won\u2019t even see dad\u2019s family (not just wife and child). It\u2019s only OP, mom, mom\u2019s family, and dad. \n\nAlso, the mother is manipulating this situation terribly. She continues to agree and is doing everything possible to make dad the bad guy. Oh sure he can spend the night Christmas Eve. Of course he can spend the entirety of Christmas Day and spend the day with only my family who probably don\u2019t want him around. Mom set the dad up to fail.", "The OP an AH, but her mother setting her up to fail here is an even bigger one. The mother is a mature adult, and will be well aware of the impact on her ex-husband's family if he ditched his wife with their very young baby for the baby's first Christmas. She knows no reasonable person would agree, and yet she's encouraging her daughter in this nonsense.", "All sounds utterly bonkers to me and the OP sounds like a bloody 12 yr old not 18. YTA for being insanely selfish and insensitive to your dad and his wife", "Yeah, I just got that from another user, too. Thanks for calling me out on that one, it's a pretty big difference.", "Right?! Me and my child\u2019s father are divorced and my fianc\u00e9 would feel so uncomfortable with my spending a whole holiday with just my ex husband and son (who is 8 and had a hard time with the new life style me being in a serious relationship brought) playing house and acting as though we were still married even going to my ex\u2019s family\u2019s house for Christmas activities. My 8 year old is now able to grasp the concept that although we have no hard feelings with his father and we understand why he desires me and his dad being with him for Christmas it just can\u2019t happen it breaks so many boundaries that a divorce kinda sets in place.", "Whoooop, you are absolutely right. Let me go in and fix that.", "Yes. Half-sibling would be more accurate.", "its more like half-sibling", "My son's dad has a daughter with his partner. I only refer to her as his sister. We don't use the term half-sister and my son would correct anyone who did.", "Imagining this from the new wife's perspective just breaks my heart. Imagine your husband fucking off for your new baby's first Christmas to sleep at his ex's house and pretend they never got divorced.", "Right?? I cannot imagine being such a good sport if I were married with a newborn. I mean, I know that when you marry someone with a child from a previous relationship, you have to be prepared to not always come first, etc., but this is too much.", "I'm wondering if the mom isn't truly over her ex-husband or the divorce since she didn't remarry like he did; which is totally valid, too, my mom stayed a single mom after my parents divorced.", "As some other commented said, Mom agreed because she knows that Dad won\u2019t wholly forego baby\u2019s first Christmas so she gets to present herself as the good guy, and alienate OP\u2019s relationship with dad, successfully I might add.", "I have half a mind that the mom still isn't over OP's dad.", "Yes\u2026and I\u2019ve said it before and will say it again-where are They going that this is the last Christmas?!?", "For sure, OP is trying to ruin new sibling's first Christmas on purpose and saying it is for nostalgia.", "It's new in the sense that he has remarried and has an infant with this wife- they are now a \"new\" family unit. Yes, OP is technically part of this family unit/dynamic, but this seems to be new, unfamiliar territory for OP, who hadn't been through a divorce/step-family/half-family scenario before, and doesn't quite know how to navigate her feelings towards everything that has happened.", "She\u2019s not an only child anymore. She literally has a half sister. She **was** an only child and is clearly struggling to grasp that she is **no longer** an only child.", "The new wife is already willing apparently to let the dad spend part of his child\u2019s first Christmas with his ex-wife and daughter. That is a lot of compromise.\n\nIt sucks that your parents are divorced and you can\u2019t have your childhood back, OP, but it\u2019s time to wake up to a new reality.", "I kind of suspect the mom said yes because she knew the father absolutely had to say no. Which itself is a little sad.", "Maybe mom wasn\u2019t on board with the divorce.", "Just about all the traditional college students where I live go home for winter break. They're home in their parents' houses for 2-4 weeks over the break, living much like they did in high school. \n\nIf OP is going off to college and coming home on breaks, the next four Christmases will be almost identical to all the Christmases she's had these last several years.", "You wanted to be a parent at 18?", "I get the feeling the mom said yes only because she knew her ex would refuse (and rightfully so) to miss his new baby\u2019s first Christmas. (Unless she\u2019s still hung up on him and was hoping for some kind of Hallmark-style reconciliation over the cookie baking.) This way she can say \u201cit was such a lovely idea, sweetie, but mean old daddy wants to spend the day with his NEW family instead!\u201d The whole concept just seems so weird and superficial and creepy to me. Mommy and Daddy standing beside the bed, smiling proudly as their little cherub drifts off to sleep? It feels like a total power play on OP\u2019s part to prove to step-mom that she\u2019ll always be his REAL kid.", "I think it's actually better with the strike-outs.  Helps OP see where her thinking is messing up.", "Yep, the son my Dad had with his new partner after the divorce is my brother.  I don't like the term step mom for his partner either though.  She is just her name and as much my friend as she is family.", "So important, and a great show of why words matters and labels shouldn't be binding. \n\nMy husband has some step siblings who would be offended to be referred to as such. My husband will tell you that's my brother, through and through, and his brother would agree.", "I'm the same! My daughter took Spanish as her required foreign language in high school and came home the second day of class looking all weird at me and goes, \"mom, did you know that \"Jake\" and \"Essie\" are my half siblings? One is my son and the other is her sister on her dad's side... I started laughing and said yes but we don't need the qualifiers. They are your brother and sister. I've never used half, step or any other kinda terms... family is family.", "Had similar thoughts about the mom being so gung-ho for her ex to spend the night without his wife there. Either she knows how fucked that request is and that he'd refuse or she herself wants this to happen which is... yikes.", "Yeah, I think you're right and OP needs therapy.  \n\nI think there is jealousy over the new baby, and she's doing what she can to make herself the center of attention. \n\nWhat 18 year old wants a Christmas like this? Making her parents play house for over 24 hours? They sit there til she falls asleep? Is she going to give them a script to act out all day? I find this whole ask super creepy and weird.", "I second this. Sounds to me like OP was an only child, and mom never remarried so probably made OP her whole world. Now OP is 18 and facing the reality of entering a world that she\u2019s not the center of, and is choosing fantasy land instead. I get it, but YTA.", "Or mom is playing along because this is her fantasy too. Mom, dad, and OP spend the whole day together just like the good old days, Mom and Dad\u2019s eyes meet over the egg nog, and they realize they never should\u2019ve split up in the first place\u2026it\u2019s like a Hallmark movie! /s", "That or mom also wants to pretend she's still married to the dad. Also sad!", "I don\u2019t think that explains it. This is a bizarre level of indulgence. I\u2019m wondering how much OP has been infantilized up to this point in her life.", "I think it\u2019s more likely that that commenter was more excited to be the \u2018bringer\u2019 of Christmas cheer than the \u2018receiver\u2019. Like, rather than wake up and see the Christmas tree all decked out in gifts, they at 18 wanted to be the one to make it happen and see the excitement on the faces of those they care about. \n\nAs opposed to them meaning they were super excited over prospective children. I could be wrong though.", "I got the vibe that the mom said yes because she wants that back, too.", "I know, this whole thing is super creepy, IMO.\n\n\"Dad, please ignore your baby's first Christmas and leave your wife alone with the baby all day to come live out a fake life pretending you're still married to mom and I'm still a little kid!\" coming from an ADULT daughter. (18, so barely so, but still... an adult.)", "I acted kind of like \u201cI want to do Christmas like we used to\u201d when I turned 18\u2026\u2026\u2026.after weeks earlier going through brain surgery to remove a brain tumor, having assloads of seizures pre and post-surgery and the (temporary) destruction of my short-term memory. I kind of think OP is clearly not experiencing that level of trauma right now\n\nOP, you need therapy. YTA", "That was my thought as well. How freaking creepy and weird is that?", "I agree. I think OP needs therapy. But maybe the mother needs some too. How many stupid romantic movies/book/media exist where the divorce parents are forced to spent time together and they realized that it was a mistake to get divorced. And the one ditched the \u201cevil\u201d new spouse. \n\nOr maybe OP \u201cruns\u201d the show at home and mom just does whatever makes her happy. \n\nWhatever it is, it\u2019s weird.", "I felt the same. She knew he, if he's any bit a decent father, won't be away from his other kid all day. By her saying \"of course\" she's guaranteeing to have a wedge between daughter and father and she can pretend to be blameless. You know she's most likely jealous of his new family.", "It\u2019s not creepy at all. She\u2019s still very much in the end of her kid part of life and wishes that her family was whole again one more time. It\u2019s a bad request, but not a creepy one. Takes like yours are mean and sad.", "I'm sorry, I can't help but think \"I want my divorced parents to ignore reality and treat me like a 7-year-old and sit by my bed until I fall asleep\" is kind of creepy.\n\nAlso it's mean and sad on OP's part to demand her father spend literally the entire 24 hours of Christmas - from the night before until she is tucked in and falls asleep the next night - away from his wife and baby. On his baby's first Christmas."]}
