Over the last few months things have taken a turn for the worse and he is days away from passing. He had colostomy surgery, two brain surgeries and Can no longer process food. He\u2019s on a useless feeding tube, can\u2019t speak, can\u2019t move, and let\u2019s just say it\u2019s all BAD. \n\nMy wife and I live near her parents (we purchased a house near them since they are elderly)  and her sister lives a few hundred miles away.

Us, we visit nearly every other day, plus whatever else they need. Like cleaning their garages, moving their houses, etc. we do this happily. \n\nFast forward to two days ago. The doctor was telling us that we should remove his feeding tube and the time is near. We should let him live in comfort, and stop these machines. He would have hours to days to maybe a week or more to live. They truly don\u2019t know. Needless to say, it was CRAZY during this moment, and I was told to call the sister. I told the sister that things were dire and she should come up fast. \n\nShe was at a work conference and left it to fly to us immediately. My wife also missed a work conference this week, and I too missed several  days of work for this. We all sacrificed, as we should. \n\nThis sister arrives and the mother decides that she wants to keep him on the machines longer. The family is divided on this but it\u2019s not our call.\n\nDuring this time, the sister has come to the realization that her dad may live another week or so.\n\nWhile at the hospital last night, the sister started saying things like \u201cI should only be speaking to doctors since I don\u2019t get the proper information\u201d, \u201cI can have full on conversations with dad\u201d (which is false) and kept making digs about us not making good choices, while also giving us the cold shoulder and acting as if we have more time than we do. \n\nApparently while I wasn\u2019t at the hospital, the sister also handed my pregnant wife her ass about how we are irresponsable for calling her and that we made the situation out to be more dire than it was.\n\nAre we the assholes in this instance?\n\nNeedless to say, I\u2019m floored and want to explode on this woman but that won\u2019t help.. to me, she\u2019s being irrational, slightly delusional, and selfish.", "created_utc": 1694876026, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16k9hon/aita_sisterinlaw_is_hella_mad_for_calling_her_to/", "score": 1354, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one is ever sure how quickly the end will come and that\u2019s before someone starts changing their minds about machines. Tbh, even when breathing machines are turned off, it can take a lot, lot longer than you might think. Long enough for the family to start to hope. \n\nIt\u2019s all dreadful, for everyone involved. But in my experience it is a time when the qualities of tolerance and forgiveness are extremely important. Because everyone has different expectations and every death is slightly different for each dying person and loved one experiencing that death. \n\nTruly, it\u2019d be better to just let it go.

Live your life, do what you need to do, live where you want but don't come flying in at the last minute being all critical and crap.

Cause if he\u2019s not then I don\u2019t see a problem. \nPeople are allowed to their opinions, but when they scream them into your face to make you feel bad then they\u2019re the ones that suck.", "If in the US, she would likely qualify under FMLA.", "You'd rather not know, or delay knowing, if the person available to speak to you isn't the one you think is 'suitable'? \nI can't imagine many doctors being willing, or having time to call every single family member themselves.", "Only a real entitled asshole rolls in from out of town with no real information or knowledge about the situation and ignores/takes over/judges the family members who have been there doing the work every day.", "Of course, why would you want someone who was most likely the person that's grieving/less emotional giving you information... like doctors and nurses have all the time in the world to tell every person in a family what's going on....", "Not everyone in the US qualifies for FMLA. My mom is dying from cancer but I've only been at my job for five months. You can't get FMLA until you've been with your employer for 12 months. Sucks.", "FMLA isn\u2019t always paid.", "Nurses have a term for this: \"cousin from California\"", "The least involved person always has the strongest opinions.", "That's why I said likely.", "NTA.  Tell the all important one that you will no longer bother her.  Then, don't.\n\nShe's grieving is no excuse.  You two are grieving AND taking care of the parents.  Anyone who has never been in the roll of caretaker has no idea how exhausting it is.", "NAH. Based on the displays of denial, she might barely be holding it together. Lashing out is not the way to handle grief, but I wouldn't take it personally.", "NTA.  I wouldn\u2019t contact her at all after this.  She can call the hospital and if she doesn\u2019t, oh well.", "NTA. You and your wife are doing the very best you can. Let SIL be a mess on her own. You can stay away from her, while she processes her own emotions. You made the call and that was the end of your responsibility to her. \n\nI'm sorry about your Dad.", "As someone who went through this exact same thing. You are NTA", "Nta but shes grieving. Rather she shows  it or not. She also may be stressed because she wanted to be there at the final moments & this extra time could impact her employment or other arrangements. This should be between her & your wife though. And your wife should let her know that she will not be calling her again. Anyone with a little common sense or who has dealt with or even researched, knows that drs can only make an educated guess. Thats it. They don't know. They gave my mom 0% chance, moved her to palative care. She remained there so they decided to send her home w hospice but hospice refused to come until she was there for several hrs because they honestly didn't think she would survive the ride. 3 days later, she kinda flipped out of it & went to my daughter's ballgame that evening. 9 specialists all gave her 0% chance of survival. She lived 10 good yrs- all better than before she went in. Im not saying this could or would happen (although you never know, she only had 7%of her heart working when she fired all her drs except her family dr). Im just saying no one truly knows & you arent responsible for mom changing her mind, drs not getting it right or anything else. If she wants more reliable or hands on information, she should be more active in his care instead of relying on 2nd hand info from ppl who are grieving. \nI am truly sorry for what you all are going through.", "NTA\n\nBut she's also probably in denial. Being there for it all, you've had more time to process everything. It doesn't mean she's being any less of an arse. But it may not be coming from as bad a place as you think. Give her some time.", "EAH. Your sister, for not realizing that situations change, and you have no control over some things. And you, for not taking into account that you DO have more time than your sister does, because you luve nearby, and traveling back and forth \"a few hundred miles\" is not negligible, not easy to arrange on a moment's notice, and is more disruptive to your sister's life than events like this are for someone living nearby. You sound as if you resent her visiting \"only twice\" recently while you visit every day. Well, tough. She has to find transportation, pay for it, make arrangements for her family (and probably pay for that too), plus, unless you're putting her up and feeding her, pay for those expenses as well. That doesn't even consider the travel time involved for her to do this. I suggest you back off and cool down--and that she do the same--and accord each other a whole lot more respect and understanding for your different circumstances.", "I don't know, my grandmother was on hospice for nine months. They finally called us and told us to come say our final goodbyes in November. She died in late February the following year. Sometimes medical professionals don't get these things exactly right.\n\nNAH.", "NTA", "NTA it\u2019s always the sibling who doesn\u2019t do anything for ailing parents that has lots of opinions on how it should be done. Ugh", "So true- by happenstance I (the youngest of 6 kids) was the only one with both my parents when it became clear they were dying- separated by 2 years - long story. Trying to figure when to tell my siblings, who were scattered across the country with many varying and very real obligations, that they needed to come was stressful and hard to communicate. Luckily everyone had a lot of grace and patience in the end but there were many fraught phone calls and face times with me sobbing to my husband and sisters in the mean time. End of life sucks and there\u2019s no guide book.", "No.  Just because you are grieving is no valid excuse to take your pain out in someone else.\n\nLearning to deal with tragedy and death is part of being an adult.\n\nDo not make excuses for shitty people who aren\u2019t grown up yet.", "Yup even if you are not old or dealing with a serious illness. A car accident could easily result in being left with severe brain damage where your brain stem still works but you are no longer there. Families have been torn apart and destroyed facing the decision to withdraw care or not. Just look up the case of Terri Schiavo. \n\n If you are a adult and don't want this for your loved ones get a advanced directive and will.", "yup.\n\nI told my kid that if he puts me on machines, when I finally DO pass... I will haunt him like beetlejuice.", "Who do you imagine the audience for this scene to be? Do you really the MIL and wife are going to react positively to OP trying to make his grieving SIL 'look like an idiot'?", "Its not OP or his wife's fault MIL decided to prolong her husband's suffering. She doesnt get to give the messengers shit for not seeing the future", "Yeah, the sister losing the chance to say goodbye should be hand waved away because you took offense at my summary of her feelings.", "exactly. my family prayed for grandma's suffering to end and her to find peace, not for her to live. that's how it is when you're there to see it. I'm not one for praying, but I did that time.", "The hospice in my area sometimes have a wait of a few days.\n\nI'm retired now, but the hospice I worked for would send social workers out often a day ahead of admission to try and coordinate with family and hospital discharge planners to see what the issues were in caring for patient and family and help family with the obviously difficult transition to move to a comfort care model.  That cost was not as much of an issue as it is today.", "The way I read it is that he was actively dying and then mom all the sudden decided not to pull the plug after sister-in-law had been made aware. Which is no reason to yell at OP or call them irresponsible.", "Tell that to SIL", "my words are directed at anyone who thinks there's a score to keep in this situation or that there's a response to this from the OP that is appropriate other than letting it go. To answer your question, no, i think someone else is likely to deliver the news next time, and they're likely to choose their words more carefully. Nobody is arguing that SIL's reaction was measured or reasonable or deserved, or, like, anything other than an emotional outburst directed at the wrong people. Yes, the SIL would not have taken it well either way. She was never going to take it well walking in to that room. Maybe you've never been the one lashing out at a family member during a period of grief, but I have. I've been on both sides. i felt awful about it afterwards when i was the one lashing out, and I also forgave my sister and my mother and my father and my brother when they've lashed out at me during periods of grief, because a onesided meltdown is easier to heal from than a massive argument that can lead to people breaking off contact with each other or developing huge rifts in the family. That's what everyone should be trying to do right now. Weathering the storm, and healing. Everyone in that room is at a breaking point. Not just the SIL, that entire family. There is so much at stake here, and the folks in this comment section advocating for hostile or \"in-kind\" responses from someone who isn't related to the person on their deathbed and who's already shown they have the presence of mind to hold their tongue are frankly being **irresponsible**. Taking this to a fight would break up the entire family at this juncture, splitting it between the SIL and her mother and OP and his wife. a snappy rejoinder may make for a good reddit comment, but it's not the bedside manner you want to engage in in real life, and the advice you post online DOES matter. Is this really the time to engage in score keeping?", "Then call to ask everyday. If your parent is dying and your in law has to be the one to inform you to fly back, you're kind of the asshole.", "[removed]", "No, if you are a decent human, it actually isn\u2019t.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
