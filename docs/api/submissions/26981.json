Over the last few months things have taken a turn for the worse and he is days away from passing. He had colostomy surgery, two brain surgeries and Can no longer process food. He\u2019s on a useless feeding tube, can\u2019t speak, can\u2019t move, and let\u2019s just say it\u2019s all BAD. \n\nMy wife and I live near her parents (we purchased a house near them since they are elderly)  and her sister lives a few hundred miles away.

Us, we visit nearly every other day, plus whatever else they need. Like cleaning their garages, moving their houses, etc. we do this happily. \n\nFast forward to two days ago. The doctor was telling us that we should remove his feeding tube and the time is near. We should let him live in comfort, and stop these machines. He would have hours to days to maybe a week or more to live. They truly don\u2019t know. Needless to say, it was CRAZY during this moment, and I was told to call the sister. I told the sister that things were dire and she should come up fast. \n\nShe was at a work conference and left it to fly to us immediately. My wife also missed a work conference this week, and I too missed several  days of work for this. We all sacrificed, as we should. \n\nThis sister arrives and the mother decides that she wants to keep him on the machines longer. The family is divided on this but it\u2019s not our call.\n\nDuring this time, the sister has come to the realization that her dad may live another week or so.\n\nWhile at the hospital last night, the sister started saying things like \u201cI should only be speaking to doctors since I don\u2019t get the proper information\u201d, \u201cI can have full on conversations with dad\u201d (which is false) and kept making digs about us not making good choices, while also giving us the cold shoulder and acting as if we have more time than we do. \n\nApparently while I wasn\u2019t at the hospital, the sister also handed my pregnant wife her ass about how we are irresponsable for calling her and that we made the situation out to be more dire than it was.\n\nAre we the assholes in this instance?\n\nNeedless to say, I\u2019m floored and want to explode on this woman but that won\u2019t help.. to me, she\u2019s being irrational, slightly delusional, and selfish.", "created_utc": 1694876026, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16k9hon/aita_sisterinlaw_is_hella_mad_for_calling_her_to/", "score": 422, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No one is ever sure how quickly the end will come and that\u2019s before someone starts changing their minds about machines. Tbh, even when breathing machines are turned off, it can take a lot, lot longer than you might think. Long enough for the family to start to hope. \n\nIt\u2019s all dreadful, for everyone involved. But in my experience it is a time when the qualities of tolerance and forgiveness are extremely important. Because everyone has different expectations and every death is slightly different for each dying person and loved one experiencing that death. \n\nTruly, it\u2019d be better to just let it go.
