I get you feel a deep connection with the people buried there and it\u2019s your homeland, but this is his.

Try not to get hung up on this and enjoy as many of those happy years with him as you can.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s unrealistic. You planned for your nuclear family and didn\u2019t factor in that they would age and start their own families. Your son wants to be buried with his wife in a place that\u2019s accessible to their friends and maybe even future children. \n\nYour home country is not his home country.", "YTA. You won\u2019t have any idea where anyone can s buried when you\u2019re dead. You\u2019ll be dead.", "YTA, sorry.", "whew\u2026my family had this same exact argument 2 years ago when my brother died. mom\u2019s side of the family wanted him either cremated (& his ashes mixed w our mom\u2019s) or buried with grandma J\u2026dad wanted him buried with his family. it literally destroyed our family because my dad buried him with his family, my aunt still won\u2019t talk to him.\n\nYTA. this is not the hill to die on.", "YTA\nHis body, his choice extends to his death.", "Yes, you are an asshole. Your son's family is his wife now. What did you expect - for your children to be buried next to you and their life partners somewhere random alone? Your children do not belong to you. I hate mothers like you.", "You know you'll be dead, right? Part of being married is starting a new life with your spouse, and that includes deciding how you'll be buried. Did you decide to be buried in your husband's family cemetery or yours? Think about it. YTA", "YTA. I get that you're upset and that's okay, but those are your feelings and you need to keep them to yourself. You came to a new country and raised children who only know that country. You can't expect them to feel loyalty to your old home. That place was never their home, it makes no sense for him to be buried there.", "YTA He has a new family now, time to cut the umbilical cord.", "If it was that important to you, don't move country yta", "You do realize you'll both be dead and won't be able to have conversations, right?\n\nEdited: YTA", "Do you know how much it costs to ship a body?!?!  NTA", "Not sure if you made it clear with how dead they will be", "I need you to come in to my company meetings where I explain how to submit an expense sheet. \u201cAs gently as I can say this\u2026.you have problems if you think you can expense concert tickets. You will be fired. I will fire you. You will be terminated. It\u2019s not your money.\u201d", "I hear those Transylvanians have a cargo ship system down pat.", "Yeah, sometimes I'm too subtle. Should I edit it to add a bit more?", "Time to do the traditional thing and dig up the old bodies to reuse the space", "This made me laugh to a disproportionate level. \u201cStay close to home, we can\u2019t afford all these trips to visit everyone\u2019s grave. We had to go to 8 time zones just to see the grandparents.\u201d", "I started the process and everyone close to me knows I want to be donated to science. They put you on lists and stuff, so someone would have to be real sketchy to do what they want with me outside of what all the paperwork I have says. There's no cost to my family or friends and they'll get my cremains eventually.", "That's the law in my home country. There's a 15 year limit on burials and after that the body has to exhumed and either cremated or put in a niche. Space is at a premium there so there's only one cemetery in the country still accepting in-ground burials and they only allow it for citizens, permanent residents, or immediate relatives of a citizen/pr.", "That's what I instructed my sons in the document I wrote about final arrangements. We had an awful time trying to dispose of my MIL's ashes that involved my older son. I'd never inflict that on my family.", "i told my husband to chuck me un the garden (plz cremate me first) then not have a funeral but let everyone tell their bosses they're going to a funeral. everyone gets a free day off on me", "And maybe she wants to be buried near her own family.", "YTA  Let people be buried wherever makes them comfortable. I have a friend who (TW) had an infant pass away only a few weeks after being born and he was buried in her husband's family plot. They had to move across the country for their jobs and she has only gotten to visit her baby's grave once in the past decade. It fucking SUCKS for her.", "If your family or religion permits cremation, could you ask your son to consider splitting his ashes between your family plot and his new plot? This is a fairly common solution for this type of situation; for example, my aunt has my cousin's ashes split between several urns, one buried, one with her, and one given to my grandma. Or otherwise perhaps come to an agreement about his family placing some of his clothing or an important item in the family plot for him?\n\nI say NAH, based off the info here, neither of you are to blame for what you want. That said, I think it would be wise to work through your emotions on this and how your children connect to their heritage now, since this situation is coming up with the oldest, to hopefully ease any anxieties that you have down the road with your other children. If you have cultural things that you value and want to pass on to your kids, you might present those ideas in the future as an option so they're not surprised.", "YTA. Why are you even dwelling on this and letting it \"eat you alive\"?  You should be way more focused on the present than what might happen in the future. You are just pushing your son away by putting pressure on him over something so trivial. If you seriously cannot let this one go, you need to see a therapist.", "If you believe in Jesus, you will all be together in heaven. The body decomposes. The soul is forever.", "So his wife would not be buried in your family plot, I take it? Your family separates spouses for burial? I can see why they wouldn\u2019t want that.", "YTA\n\nHe and his wife are a family now. They get to decide where they\u2019ll be buried on their own terms.", "YTA and this is a very weird, morbid and unhinged thing to argue about with your son. \n\nFirst, it\u2019s really none of your business what your adult son does. He\u2019s a grown up and he doesn\u2019t need to clear things with you. This was his own personal decision and you should stay in your lane. \n\nSecond, if all goes how it should, your son will outlive you and you will never, ever be any the wiser as to where his eternal resting place is. So this is really just the most pointless conversation ever. Ever. \n\nThis is just really weird. Fighting over final arrangements of a theoretical deceased person is just\u2026a lot. Get a hobby please, you have too much time to think.", "YTA. So it\u2019s okay for you to be buried with your spouse, but bit him? \n\nDo you even hear how stupid that sounds?\n\nHe\u2019s a grown ass adult. You get no say in this. Never bring it up again and mind your own business.", "YTA and honestly you sound unhinged.", "YTA \n\nHis wife is his family. You? You are EXTENDED family. He wants to be buried with his partner, his wife, his immediate family member, whatever you want to call her. \n\nStop thinking you matter THAT much in his life that he should want to be buried next to you. You\u2019re his mom. You don\u2019t come first.", "YTA. he wants to be buried with his family. why would he want to be in his home country and far from her even in death?", "YTA i\u2019m sorry this is going to be harsh and sound very mean and i don\u2019t really mean to be mean but someone\u2019s gotta tell you. \n\nyou will likely die before your son. you will be buried and dead. you will not know what is buried in the earth next to you. if he\u2019s there, you won\u2019t know. if he\u2019s not there, you won\u2019t know. you will be dead and decaying in a box. \n\nyour son is married now. he and his wife want to be buried together. most married couples want to be buried together. they have the right to make that choice for themselves, you need to respect that. if you keep pushing you\u2019re going to ruin your relationship with your son. it\u2019s more important to have him near you *now while you\u2019re alice* not in however many years when he dies and you\u2019ve already been dead", "YTA. \n\nmy grandma and her siblings had the option to be buried near their property in mexico. A few of them were while my grandma, her brother, and her sister were buried in states. there\u2019s family laid to rest on both sides but that should remain the choice of the person.", "YTA, have you ever considered that if he has children in the future they would have to travel to a whole ass different country just to visit their father\u2019s grave? He\u2019s married now, he doesn\u2019t belong to you. \n\nOn top of that, you\u2019re making a hypothetical financial burden on your son\u2019s family. Taking a corpse to a different country that he wasn\u2019t born in ain\u2019t free.", "YTA. I'm sorry but that body is not your son anymore, whether you are buried next to each other or not won't matter. Our bodies are biodegradable, we will decompose and become part of the dirt. Your souls will reunite (if you happen to believe in that)our earthly shells don't matter at the end of the day.", "Soft YTA, you\u2019re allowed to want what you want but you can\u2019t control where your kids live or where they\u2019re buried", "Y T A, sort of. \"Sort of\" because who wants to think about those things. But you brought it up!\n\nGrownups make their own plans and they rest where they rest. Adult children choose to be married with their spouses and.children who did young. It's costly to ship bodies, and who plans for that? Not everyone is buriable, including people who die in huge explosions or when planes explode way out at sea. You have to rely on the person who executed your will or another individual to fulfill your requests. They won't do as you request if it's not workable, in their eyes. \n\nMy brother in law suicided. He knew there was a place for him with his parents. He requested that the plaque with his name read \"Born alone, died alone. The rest was in between.\" His brother and I decided that the order was the product of his disturbed mind, and didn't do it.\n\nYou can plan, but no power on earth guarantees that you'll get your wish. Sorry, but you have to understand that and not continue to make demands about an unforeseeable future from your children.", "YTA for expecting him to go with your wishes for his remains, you are N T A for wanting something, but for expecting it.", ">My daughter told me I was being pushy and acting like a jerk\n\nOP, she's not wrong. YTA.", "YTA, it\u2019s weird that you even expected this. You didn\u2019t think your kids would grow up and have families of their own???", "YTA, your children get to make their own choices on something this personal!", "You made me laugh and wake my dog. He's now angry with me.\n\nAnd yeah, bro, no problem, let me know when works for you. \n\nUnless you want me not to be subtle. I can do that, too.", "I can imagine OP trying to drag the still alive kid to the burial plot, a la Monty Python. \u201cI\u2019m not dead yet!\u201d \n\n\u201cShut up and get in the coffin.\u201d\n\nIf that was you subtle, I\u2019d hate to see you direct.", "I wanna be a tree.

Don't care where I'm planted, I just want to be a tree.", "Same here.", "\ud83d\ude02\n\nWas my original post too subtle? should I edit it to be more direct? I don't want there to be any confusion.", "Mandai Columbarium after those 15 years, right? (If you wish). My country has 60 years, after which, I believe the same thing happens.
