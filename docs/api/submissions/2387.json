NAH for WANTING him in the family plot and him not wanting to do that, but absolutely TA for insisting on it. He has family here, and kids here, and will probably have grandchildren here, plus nieces and nephews and in-laws on his wife's side. If his body is carted all the way back to your home country, none of them will get to visit the grave. Even TRAVELLING to the funeral may be prohibitively expensive. His body, even after death, HE decides where it goes. NTA for reminding him and asking him to reconsider, absolutely YTA for your drama over it.

Instead, just a challenge for you:  \n\nWhy is your desire to have your family buried with you any more valid than his desire to have his family buried with him?  As parents, part of the joy (and challenge) is letting them start their own legacy.  Take this as such.", "YTA. Maybe he wants to be buried here where all his children can visit his resting place, not in an entirely different country. That was a decision you made, they get to decide if that\u2019s what they want.

Many, MANY people are not buried next to their parents. I have family members buried in veteran cemeteries miles away from their parents. My grandmother is not even buried next to her mother, and my Uncle and Aunt are not buried with her, let alone in the same state. Besides, he would probably like to be buried next to his wife who I am sure you probably would not allow in the family plot I am going to guess.", "YTA, like everyone said it\u2019s not for wanting it it\u2019s for badgering him about it. Here\u2019s the thing, you\u2019re from your home country, lived your whole life there until your 20s\u2026 this isn\u2019t meant to sound any kind of way, but your son is was born and raised American, he has a family and life of his own here, that has always been his home\u2026 to him, as sad as this may be for you, it\u2019s YOUR country not his. If you went to the US to start a new/better life, I would think you\u2019d want your kids to feel at home there so why would you think he\u2019d want his wife/family to have to travel out of the US to visit his grave. I get you feel a deep connection with the people buried there and it\u2019s your homeland, but this is his. He doesn\u2019t have that connection, aside from with you, and that\u2019s his right to want to be near the family he\u2019s made. \nIt sounds like you\u2019re not a huge fan of his wife either \u201cshe\u2019s fine\u201d, I also want to state cause it seems like this may be an underlying thing you\u2019re thinking- she didn\u2019t take him from your plot/family, he more than likely would\u2019ve always wanted this regardless of who he married, because the US is his home. \nAgain, you\u2019re Not TA for asking or assuming, but you are if you let the problems of the dead affect your living relationship with your kid/kid\u2019s family whom you love.", "Yta. His nuclear family is his wife and children. They come first now. \n\nHow would you feel if your husband's parents and family had their own plot and he wanted to be buried with them, bc his mother was guilting him to choose them, away from you.  Ah yeah! Think long and hard about that question and your answer.\n\nYour home country is not his. The country he was raised in is his country.", "YTA\n\nYour son is allowed to have his own opinion and do his own thing with regards to where he\u2019ll be buried. You need to stop pushing for it before things get ugly and you regret it. It\u2019s never okay to keep forcing someone to do what you want to do. \n\nOf course he\u2019ll want to be buried with HIS OWN FAMILY, as in his wife and their future kids (if their future kids agree).\n\nApologize to your son and accept his decision.", "You can pass at any moment anywhere and it won\u2019t matter to you. It\u2019s quite fortunate for people to receive burial customs according to their wishes considering anything could happen. \n\nThe way you are acting is going to push your son further away from you in both life *and* death. If you think it\u2019s tearing you up that you won\u2019t be buried with him, imagine if he decides one day that he wants to cut you off from his life based on your behavior. YTA", "YTA. You need to respect his decision and leave him alone.", "YTA.. not for wanting it, but when that\u2019s not what is happening, making a big deal out of it! \nIt\u2019s not your choice where he is buried. Him and his wife made a decision and you need to respect it!", "YTA. Your son has more immediate family now (wife, possible future kids) who may want to visit his grave if he passes. And he\u2019s an adult - it\u2019s his decision.", "YTA - you don\u2019t get to make this decision for your son. He has his own family now in an entirely different country. Of course if the worst should happen his wife and children would want him near THEM, not across an ocean in a strange country.", "YTA, he has a family of his own now.", "YTA. He doesn\u2019t need to care about your family plot, it\u2019s his resting place, not yours. Also you\u2019d be dead so it really doesn\u2019t matter anyways.", "YTA. \n\nThis is home and only country he knows. He and his wife made their own plans.", "YTA. Ideally, you'll already be dead anyway. It's not like you were going to be visiting his grave. Honestly, this is creepy that you're pushing it this much.", "I get that's what you wanted but your son is an adult and he's going to forge his own path. Very soft YTA. This is one of those things you can't control.", "YTA. His body, his right to decide what happens to it. Also, why would you care where he is going to be buried as he is presumably going to outlive you?", "Well, if your children were born there maybe they don't see your home country as their home country. He's about to start a family were you are so YTA if you keep insisting on being buried in the same plot. Don't let this be a problem for you and your son...", "N TA for wanting him to be buried near you, but YTA for insisting. He is an adult, and he is entitled to make his own decisions.", "NAH \u2014 totally understandable that you are disappointed since you have had this expectation for a long time. Unfortunately, this is not going to work out they way you want it to. Leave it alone. Enjoy your life, make happy memories with your family, don\u2019t waste your time or energy trying to control something you have no control over.\n\nI say this very lovingly, once you\u2019re gone, you will not know who is next to you. Is it really worth making this an issue?", "How would your reaction be, if your son tried to get you buried in his home country?", "YTA. He asked you to drop it. It's his body, his choice where he wants to be buried. \n\nAnd you'll both be dead when that happens. It's not going to matter. What are you going to do, hitch the ghost plane and haunt him?", "INFO: why is it important to you that your son be buried near you, but you don't think it equally important to him that he is buried somewhere where his wife and children can also be buried? When you get married, you need to recognize that other people have families too.", "YTA -  His life is here and this is where their plots are.  You can keep pushing and push him away.  Sounds like y0ur daughter is already warning you of that too.  He was your son until he married.  He will always be your child but now he is a man with his own family.  Cut the cord.", "YTA - your adult children have their own families and will do what they want.", "YTA. Your son has his own life, and where he choose to be buried is entirely his own right.

However, you were perhaps a bit naive that as your children built lives in the US and families of their own that their ties to your home country or even desire to be buried in a burial plot may change.\n\nYou're allowed to be disappointed but you can't keep insisting.", "NAH. Your feeling upset is understandable but your son also has his own family now and he's obviously old enough to make his own decisions. BUT you would be if you continue insisting even when he says no.", "NAH. It\u2019s okay for you to *want* this, sure. It\u2019s okay for him to say no. He asked you to drop it so it\u2019s time to do just that. You would be the AH if you kept pushing it.", "NAH.  I'm being very specific- you are not the A for wanting it. But you will be the second you go further than that. Apologize for being pushy and do not add a \"but I just wanted\" nope, not but. Sorry for being pushy. Then let it go.", "NAH (Yet). They have their own lives. It's their right to decide. It's not wrong to want to keep your family together but since you've already been rejected because they already made different arrangements then drop it. Keep pushing then you will be TA.", "NTA, you can feel the way you feel, but you also have to understand that his life is where he is now.  His wife and children, and grandchildren, and friends should all have the option of visiting his grave locally if thats how he wants it.  You made the decisions in raising him, but hes an adult now, and gets to decide where his life gose from here.  Family traditions, ie. Social pressure from beyond the grave, do not have to dictate your life, or his.", "NAH\n\nYou do have a right to be upset since you did purchase those plots and it is a family tradition; however, he now does have a family of his own and has the right to pick where he is buried.", "NTA for wanting, but you will if you don't drop it now that your adult son has told you the plans he has made for his family.\n\nYou say there is spot for your son, what about his wife?

You have to respect that autonomy. He also has his family that has been built in America that now has its own customs as well as your home country\u2019s.

I'd like to be buried there. But, as I've told my husband, it's up to him. If he wants me closer, fine. If he wants to cremate, fine. I'm dead. Use what you can from the body and then go with what feels right. I'd LIKE to be buried with family but once I die, the LIVING come first. What do THEY need from my burial site?

What are they gonna do if OPs kids can\u2019t afford to send OP and OPs SO dead body across the world?", "This. Plus the kids were born here in America. This son's spouse is from here. Maybe they will be buried near her family? A grave site is just that. It's a place to put someone's body. My first husband is from California, I'm from Indiana. When he died 13 years ago I bought plots at my families grave site. His parents were fine with that.", "This exactly. Her son was not born in that country, and  I assume the wife wasn\u2019t either.
