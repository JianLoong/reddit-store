He is a good kid but like all 12 year olds likes pushing boundaries. \n\nLast night I woke up in the middle of the night and noticed the iPad was missing from it'a usually stop on the living room desk. I went up to see if any of the kids had it in their rooms. I went into my oldest son's room and was on it watching Netflix. He had headphones in and didn't hear me come in so he was surprised. It was around 2am so I told him to get to bed. He had to get up at 6:30am for school. I woke him up at normal time and he said he was too tired to go. I told him that was too bad and his consequence for staying up late was having to go to school.\n\nHe went but came home and went right to sleep. My wife was working all night and missed all of this so when he got home and went to sleep she asked me if he was sick. I told her he wasn't sick just tired from being up all night. She said it was a dick move to make him go to school when I knew he was tired. She said we could have punished him another way but I think natural consequences are the most effective. I do the majority of the day to day parenting since my wife works a lot and I know this works for all 3 of them. She still thinks he should have stayed home and said I am going to ruin his sleep schedule. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the response. My wife wanted to let him stay home but ban him from the iPad for a week. She wanted him to be punished but thought I went about it the wrong way. She does not coddle any of the kids and I am generally the softer parent. She works a lot and I am home so I handle the day-to-day kid stuff. She doesn't so I think this was a case of her not understanding that natural consequences tend to work better for our kids than imposed punishments. She is at work again but I will discuss it with her later. She is not a bad person nor does she spoil our kids like many of the comments believe.", "created_utc": 1673673030, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bg5x2/aita_for_forcing_my_son_to_go_to_school_after_he/", "score": 1023, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are teaching natural consequences to his choices, and his sleep schedule will be just fine.", "Yehhhh I'm going to say NTA. There was a consequence to the action...the punishment fit the crime as far as I can tell.\n\nIt sucks...going to school on very little sleep would suck...but if he hadn't been up late watching movies, he wouldn't be in that position. \n\nI do wonder why he has access to technology at that time tho?

If you hadn't made him go to school then you would have taught him that if he breaks the rules and stays up late then he doesn't have to go to school the next day. He was ruining his own sleep schedule, you're forcing him to fix it.\n\nI suggest putting a password on the iPad. He's shown that he cannot be trusted with it. If that's not feasible (e.g. he would figure it out) then I suggest physically locking it away somewhere.", "NTA\n\nYour wife's reasoning makes no sense. His sleep schedule is screwed up no matter what, if he's at home or in school. To let him stay home is rewarding him for his bad behavior of taking the ipad when it's not allowed.", "NTA.

School is a commitment that you have to honor because one committed to it. Going to school tired isn't some rarity too. This is teaching what responsibilities are for and what choices are wise.", "NTA. You're right that natural consequences are most effective. You didn't punish him. You simply held him to the same standards you would have kept him to if he hadn't made a foolish choice, right? He would have had to go to school, if he hadn't stayed up late and worn himself out?\n\nSo then, he's simply conducted a scientific experiment. When you stay up late on a day on which you have responsibilities, the day after doesn't feel good. Now he knows.", "Yeah NTA.", "NTA at all", "NTA. How many people go to work tired on a daily basis?

An FAFO moment. Bet he'll leave the iPad on the desk now. And the incident is now over. No need to make a bigger deal out of it. He did the crime and then the time. Done and done. \n\nI understand momma having a soft spot and not wanting her little boy to have a hard day. Sometimes being a parent is really hard, especially when you have to watch your kid go through a hard time, even if it was their own making. \n\nYou did the right thing, IMO.", "NTA   \nYour kid will learn from this and hopefully never do it again.", "NTA.

That's absolutely ridiculous. Just as much as they need nutrients, they need exercise for their brain (i.e. school).\n\nKids need structure, they're lazy and get addicted easily.

Honestly I think this is great preparation for adulthood, stay up too late watching a movie and its not like you can just afford to not work the next day, actions have consequences. I like your style", "NTA\n\nYour punishment was not excessive and you didn't deny him reasonable sleep when he got home nor did you hilly or belittle him. \n\nThe onlyntime a parent needs to protect their child from the consequences of their actions are if the consequences would too severely hurt them, here it does not. \n\nI understand your wife, it's not fun to watch.

As others have said, the punishment directly followed the offense - staying up too late when you have commitments in the morning doesn't remove the commitment. You just get to feel like crap while you fulfill your commitment. Trust me on this: this is a lesson he needs to learn *now*.\n\nYour wife is flat wrong on the \"sleep schedule\" bit, as well. Letting him stay up late and then sleep in late will shift his sleep schedule to... that.", "NTA, but maybe check in if he was awake because he was watching the iPad OR if he was watching the iPad because he was awake.
