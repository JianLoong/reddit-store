He is a good kid but like all 12 year olds likes pushing boundaries. \n\nLast night I woke up in the middle of the night and noticed the iPad was missing from it'a usually stop on the living room desk. I went up to see if any of the kids had it in their rooms. I went into my oldest son's room and was on it watching Netflix. He had headphones in and didn't hear me come in so he was surprised. It was around 2am so I told him to get to bed. He had to get up at 6:30am for school. I woke him up at normal time and he said he was too tired to go. I told him that was too bad and his consequence for staying up late was having to go to school.\n\nHe went but came home and went right to sleep. My wife was working all night and missed all of this so when he got home and went to sleep she asked me if he was sick. I told her he wasn't sick just tired from being up all night. She said it was a dick move to make him go to school when I knew he was tired. She said we could have punished him another way but I think natural consequences are the most effective. I do the majority of the day to day parenting since my wife works a lot and I know this works for all 3 of them.

You simply held him to the same standards you would have kept him to if he hadn't made a foolish choice, right? He would have had to go to school, if he hadn't stayed up late and worn himself out?\n\nSo then, he's simply conducted a scientific experiment.

An FAFO moment. Bet he'll leave the iPad on the desk now. And the incident is now over. No need to make a bigger deal out of it. He did the crime and then the time. Done and done. \n\nI understand momma having a soft spot and not wanting her little boy to have a hard day.

That's absolutely ridiculous. Just as much as they need nutrients, they need exercise for their brain (i.e. school).\n\nKids need structure, they're lazy and get addicted easily.

As others have said, the punishment directly followed the offense - staying up too late when you have commitments in the morning doesn't remove the commitment. You just get to feel like crap while you fulfill your commitment. Trust me on this: this is a lesson he needs to learn *now*.\n\nYour wife is flat wrong on the \"sleep schedule\" bit, as well.

If he wants to stay up late he can, but now he knows he will still be required to go to school regardless of what he does all night.", "NTA\n\nLots of people saying \"the punishment fit\" or \"these were natural consequences\".\n\nWell to me it was routine, everyone knew he had to be up at 6.30, it was no surprise, it wasn't a consequence, it was normal. Him being tired was a consequence of his actions.\n\nBut it wasn't a punishment either. I still think a punishment is due. \n\nIf he gets home and sleeps, he can just split up his sleep into shifts and do it again, make a habit of it. 2-3 hours after school, 4 hours at night and it's not an issue for him. \n\nKeeping him awake like a regular schedule when he got home would have been the normal thing to do, push that endurance, make it less worth it to do again, and still hand out a punishment for the initial silliness of taking the iPad at night when they aren't supposed to.", "Nta \n\nI actually wish this had happened to me to avoid that stupid 12 year old 'hey, I can avoid consequences by doing _____' phase so many of us have hahahah", "NTA. That's how we handle it with our kid: You can stay up as long as you want, but you HAVE to get up in the morning for school, no excuses (except an illness of course). Works perfectly.", "NTA - I pulled this move except it was a new book, I read it til about 3am (finished it too).  \n\nSurprise surprise I still had to go to school...", "NTA, you didn't ruin his sleep schedule,  he did! Keeping him home will just show him that if he does it again, he will just get a day off school", "NTA. This was an absolutely reasonable natural consequence for staying up all night, and your wife is being ridiculous.", "NTA. Actions have consequences, & it\u2019s better to learn that sooner rather than later.", "No freaking way... NTA\n\nLittle dude is now learning the consequences of his actions. School is not optional. Watchis tv at night is. \n\nMy mum would have kept me awake after school too and made me do any homework first that way i slept closer to my normal sleep time.", "NTA this is the best punishment, keeping him off would of got him sleeping all day and awake at night again.", "NTA. Now you have me looking at the clock on my iPad, OP. Thank goodness it\u2019s the weekend.", "NTA \n\nYou let him nap after school so it's not like he didn't get any sleep all day.\nPlus, sleep disruptions happen all throughout life. \nIt sucks but kids need to know life doesn't stop because they got 4 hours instead of 8.", "NTA", "NTA - I used to do the same thing, staying up to catch horror movies playing at midnight on tv \ud83d\ude05 a little bit of tiredness isn\u2019t going to hurt him in the long run, and it\u2019s good for him to learn that yes, you can stay up until 2am watching movies, but you have to accept the consequence in the morning.", "NTA. Not even an extreme punishment. I mean, crap, how many of us do this on a regular basis then have to drag our butts to work?", "NTA his only responsibility in life at the moment is going to school. \n\nI am the generation \"if you can party, you can work\". We did those stunts, too. And we had to go to school if we wanted to our not. It's part of growing up and to learn some consequences in a semi-hard way. You son can now decide if a night of binge watching Netflix is worth of a hard day at school.", "This is an easy peasy NTA.  \nDirect correlation between what was done wrong and the consequences.   \nAlso: I was this kid and it is waaaaaayyy more effective to spend one miserable overtired day at school to learn the lesson, than to give in and let your son stay at home.  \n\n\n(Also: I often fail miserably at going to bed in time - seems to be a lesson one forgets in adulthood LOL)", "Definitely NTA. You taught your son a valuable lesson.", "NTA. Let him suffer the consequences (which weren\u2019t even that bad). You didn\u2019t really punish him, he just had to fulfill his usual obligations. Totally reasonable. If he\u2019d slept bad because of nightmares, for example, you might have made a different choice, but here he brought it on himself.", "What you did is literally an example of what the Love and Logic parenting course teaches you you're supposed to do. \n\nNTA, natural consequences are the most effective training tool", "NTA. You're right. There are two issues here though- the first is the sleep which you dealt with, correctly I think, with natural consequences. The second issue is will he be punished for the taking the ipad without permission? The first one is more about helping him understand how to listen to his body and know what it needs. The second is about being a decent person. I think maybe your wife is more focused on the taking of the ipad as the 'crime' and you are more focused on the staying up too late.", "Letting him stay home would have rewarded his rulebreaking. Now he understands the consequence of what he was doing. NTA", "NTA. It\u2019s the same principle as going into work the day after a night out drinking, You chose to drink you deal with having a hangover at work.", "NTA.", "NTA. I\u2019m glad you are parenting because mom would raise a spoilt prince with no concept of consequences for actions. Miss school because you made the decision to watch stuff til 2am? Why does that sound reasonable to her? She would baby him to the point of uselessness if you ever stop pushing back.", "NTA\nThat is the right move.\nGood parenting.", "NTA. Stay up late and get rewarded? Instead he learned a valuable lesson of consequences. Teaching kids routine now creates healthy habits when they\u2019re adults. Not sure where your wife\u2019s head is with this one. Maybe show her the post for better understand", "NTA.  I would have done the exact same thing (and have). Actions have consequences.\n\n(When my child pulled this stunt, I emailed the teacher and explained that they might be in a super grumpy mood and why).", "NTA.\nMine would have been forced to go to school and still punished.", "NTA.\n\nI did the same thing way back when and understood my choices and the consequences it would bring you are just making it apparent. \n\nThis is some good parenting technique because you aren\u2019t punishing the child for what they did but the child is punishing themselves. \n\n20 years later I do the same thing and regret it every time but it doesn\u2019t stop me lmao.", "Nope! That\u2019s his fault he can deal with the consequences of staying up too late!", "NTA Going to school is not a punishment, and you should not teach your kids to see it as a punishment. It\u2019s a responsibility.", "NTA. Is it acceptable for parents to let their kids skip school like this? Unless I was sick when I was a kid my ass was going to school. Schools don\u2019t appreciate kids racking up unexcused absences either. Being tired because I watched a movie late is a dumb excuse and your wife is spoiling/enabling him.", "I still need to go to work even if I'm tired after watching Netflix till 4 AM. School is the \"work\" for children and is not supposed to be skipped just because they're tired after making poor choices. NTA\n\nTip: use parent controls to limit screen time", "NTA. Play stupid stay up all night games, win be tired all day at school prizes.", "NAH.\n\nThis js actually an effective way to let teenages understand the consequences.\n\nAnd it's school, not a dangerous job. Assuming the child has a safe way to get to school, then there's nothing wrong at all.", "NTA cuz I\u2019ve been that kid, teen, and adult that get sucked into what I\u2019ve been doing cuz of my hyperfixation lol like what would happen if he did this on the daily? New sleep schedule sadly lol (thanks insomnia) or be the type that would miss work. I mean it would work out eventually if he did night shifts like I did at 16 years old and toughen up the mental mind lol", "I was that kid and pulled that once at his age. Needless to say, I seldom did it again.", "Exactly this!! My kids have done the same thing and gotten the same consequence. Heck, so have I! OP absolutely NTA. and I say that because your wife\u2019s response is\u2026 strange to me,  as a parent. It\u2019s crucial that kids learn there are consequences to their behavior. And the consequence to sneaking the iPad and staying up late should not be \u201cthen I get to bag out on all my responsibilities cuz I\u2019m tiiiiiired.\u201d", "Exactly what I thought. He has to learn actions have consequences and the sooner the better. There's no time like the present", "My wife wanted to ban him for using the iPad for a week.", "So true. This kid\u2019s mother is sending him the message that you just take a day off if you\u2019re tired from watching films too late. Just as well he has a firm but fair parent.", "I think that is unfair. I disagree with her but I am sure once we fully discuss it she will have a better understanding.\n\nI do most of the day to day parenting so that can be tough for her. We will talk about it when she gets home.", "Race is irrelevant. What did I do wrong here?", "It seems like your wife feels like she has to be the nice one because she doesn't spend as much time with the kids as you do. By doing that, she would just be spoiling him.", "I think that following your wife's advice would be spoiling him", "You might want to look into ways of setting a parent lock on the iPad so it can\u2019t be used overnight, just in case he tries to do the same thing again.", "Nta. Being tired is not a valid reason not to go to school. And a 12yo isn't ready to decide to skip a day of school.\n\nPart of Parenting101 is making sure your kids don't skip school and do their homework.", "Then punish  him . Going  to school  after not sleeping  is the right way to handle it but you should  also punish  him. When he ll be an adult  he will have to go to work despite  losing sleep by doing  something  else and continue with the normal  stuff. Going to school  is not punishment  imo it's  just the normal daily  program.  Nta", "I honestly don\u2019t think it\u2019s unfair. Might she be feeling guilty about working all the time, and that\u2019s leading her to baby your son? Not wanting him to go to school because he tired himself out misbehaving is her not wanting him to suffer the consequences of his own actions. That\u2019s a dangerous outlook. Your punishment made him face the reality of his actions, much better than simply taking away his iPad would have.  Also, the only one ruining his sleep schedule is himself. Does your wife try to coddle him in other ways?", "you did nothing wrong but good parenting.  Natural consequences are what kids need so they are familiar with them and might think of them before they act as adults.\n\nI usually let my kids know what the consequences were beforehand so if they chose to break a rule, they knew what was coming and had no one to blame but themselves.  They hated it when I asked them what I said the consequence would be and made them answer followed up by 'so who's fault is it you're being punished?' and made them answer also.", "I feel like he learned his lesson. The point of a consequence is to make sure they learned from their behavior. With how miserable he was this morning and after school I think it will be a long time before he even considers this again.\n\nWe are going to be putting more parental controls on the iPad and will be charging it in the master bedroom from now on to prevent this from happening.", "Nah. When he gets older, he'll be weighing shit like that all the time. Stay up late to study/do schoolwork and risk being tired the next day shit.", "Me at 6:20 scrolling through Reddit and having Lay\u2019s potato chips instead of sleeping Lmaooooo.", "Welp it\u2019s always that one dude that ruins it for everyone\u2026.on the other hand, it\u2019s stuff like this that piqued my interest as a penetration(cybersecurity) tester lol", "You could  give him like an essay  to do as to why what he did was wrong  and  what were the consequences  if you like -just to drive the point home.  It is of course your decision.", "Hooooooooonk.... mimimimi", "Me reading your comment and watching at 6:20 instead of sleeping. God, I have such horrible sleep hygiene", "Same lmao"]}
