He is a good kid but like all 12 year olds likes pushing boundaries. \n\nLast night I woke up in the middle of the night and noticed the iPad was missing from it'a usually stop on the living room desk. I went up to see if any of the kids had it in their rooms. I went into my oldest son's room and was on it watching Netflix. He had headphones in and didn't hear me come in so he was surprised. It was around 2am so I told him to get to bed. He had to get up at 6:30am for school. I woke him up at normal time and he said he was too tired to go. I told him that was too bad and his consequence for staying up late was having to go to school.\n\nHe went but came home and went right to sleep. My wife was working all night and missed all of this so when he got home and went to sleep she asked me if he was sick. I told her he wasn't sick just tired from being up all night. She said it was a dick move to make him go to school when I knew he was tired. She said we could have punished him another way but I think natural consequences are the most effective. I do the majority of the day to day parenting since my wife works a lot and I know this works for all 3 of them. She still thinks he should have stayed home and said I am going to ruin his sleep schedule. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: Thank you for all the response. My wife wanted to let him stay home but ban him from the iPad for a week. She wanted him to be punished but thought I went about it the wrong way. She does not coddle any of the kids and I am generally the softer parent. She works a lot and I am home so I handle the day-to-day kid stuff. She doesn't so I think this was a case of her not understanding that natural consequences tend to work better for our kids than imposed punishments. She is at work again but I will discuss it with her later. She is not a bad person nor does she spoil our kids like many of the comments believe.", "created_utc": 1673673030, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bg5x2/aita_for_forcing_my_son_to_go_to_school_after_he/", "score": 2169, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are teaching natural consequences to his choices, and his sleep schedule will be just fine.", "Yehhhh I'm going to say NTA. There was a consequence to the action...the punishment fit the crime as far as I can tell.\n\nIt sucks...going to school on very little sleep would suck...but if he hadn't been up late watching movies, he wouldn't be in that position. \n\nI do wonder why he has access to technology at that time tho?

If you hadn't made him go to school then you would have taught him that if he breaks the rules and stays up late then he doesn't have to go to school the next day. He was ruining his own sleep schedule, you're forcing him to fix it.\n\nI suggest putting a password on the iPad. He's shown that he cannot be trusted with it. If that's not feasible (e.g. he would figure it out) then I suggest physically locking it away somewhere.", "NTA\n\nYour wife's reasoning makes no sense. His sleep schedule is screwed up no matter what, if he's at home or in school. To let him stay home is rewarding him for his bad behavior of taking the ipad when it's not allowed.", "NTA.

School is a commitment that you have to honor because one committed to it. Going to school tired isn't some rarity too. This is teaching what responsibilities are for and what choices are wise.", "NTA. You're right that natural consequences are most effective. You didn't punish him. You simply held him to the same standards you would have kept him to if he hadn't made a foolish choice, right? He would have had to go to school, if he hadn't stayed up late and worn himself out?\n\nSo then, he's simply conducted a scientific experiment. When you stay up late on a day on which you have responsibilities, the day after doesn't feel good. Now he knows.", "Yeah NTA.", "NTA at all", "NTA. How many people go to work tired on a daily basis?

An FAFO moment. Bet he'll leave the iPad on the desk now. And the incident is now over. No need to make a bigger deal out of it. He did the crime and then the time. Done and done. \n\nI understand momma having a soft spot and not wanting her little boy to have a hard day. Sometimes being a parent is really hard, especially when you have to watch your kid go through a hard time, even if it was their own making. \n\nYou did the right thing, IMO.", "NTA   \nYour kid will learn from this and hopefully never do it again.", "NTA.

That's absolutely ridiculous. Just as much as they need nutrients, they need exercise for their brain (i.e. school).\n\nKids need structure, they're lazy and get addicted easily.

I like your style", "NTA\n\nYour punishment was not excessive and you didn't deny him reasonable sleep when he got home nor did you hilly or belittle him. \n\nThe onlyntime a parent needs to protect their child from the consequences of their actions are if the consequences would too severely hurt them, here it does not. \n\nI understand your wife, it's not fun to watch.

As others have said, the punishment directly followed the offense - staying up too late when you have commitments in the morning doesn't remove the commitment. You just get to feel like crap while you fulfill your commitment. Trust me on this: this is a lesson he needs to learn *now*.\n\nYour wife is flat wrong on the \"sleep schedule\" bit, as well. Letting him stay up late and then sleep in late will shift his sleep schedule to... that.", "NTA, but maybe check in if he was awake because he was watching the iPad OR if he was watching the iPad because he was awake.

You can set the wifi to go off at a certain time, or turn it off yourself at night to keep that from happening again. NTA", "That 12 year old has balls. If I did that as a kid and then asked to stay home on top. They would have laughed themselves silly and then punish me if I made everyone late.", "This is cause and effect, stay up late = too tired for school/work. Letting the child stay home to rest/sleep but be deprived on the iPad is NOT an effective tool / punishment. It's little more than a slap on the wrist!\n\nOddly enough, OP, your parenting style sounds like my dad's. I \"skipped\" school one day in first grade. My mom called my dad to come punish me and teach me a lesson about not going to school. Dad made me get dressed for school, took me to the school, then (without a pre-set appointment) sat me down in the principal's office and made me tell the principal WHY I didn't want to go to school and I couldn't leave the office until my dad was satisfied with the answer. I still squirm in shame about that nearly 40 years later!\n\nOP IS NTA!", "NTA. If you let him stay home he would learn that missing out on a week of iPad means he gets to skip school", "You should also take away the iPad privilege because of the sneaking since he knew he wasn't supposed to do it in the first place.   The going to school tired is the nat. consequence of staying up past bedtime. The loss of privilege is the consequence of sneaking elec. into his room...2 seperate tho related offenses", "Going to school  is not punishment - that\u2019s life. He needs to go to school and lose iPad for a week or whatever.  And start switching the wifi off at night!", "You've made your overtired 6 year old their teacher's problem by sending her to school, you realize.", "You can turn off the wifi.", "Your consequence will have a far greater impact on his behavior than the punishment your wife wanted to impose. Natural consequences are the best at teaching. If he were an adult, he would have to get up and go to work even if he chose to stay up late. We have all done it at one point or another,  and it\u2019s a good lesson to learn. NTA", "NAH You were perfectly right. Any 12 year old is supposed to be in bed at 9pm when they have school the following morning. He has to learn the consequences of his choices.", "NTA\n\nHes gotta learn somehow and this was the perfect way. I remember staying up until 3-5am and getting like 2-3hrs of sleep and get up for school. I learned to binge watch my stuff on Friday nights and not be up late.\n\nWorked with work too though I usually stayed up a bit later or would go a full 24hrs without sleep because I was watching something and had work.", "NTA. Hell yeah, the kid needs to go to school tired! Maybe he\u2019ll learn a lesson. Also, he should lose iPad privileges. \n\nYou don\u2019t give a kid who broke the rules and stayed up late a reward of a day off to do more movie watching.", "Nta. Sleep management is important for kids to learn. My kids (16f ,15m) have no bedtime and completely regulate themselves. They know if they want to stay up, they deal with the consequences the next day. There have been a few times my daughter has stayed up till 3am working on projects. She's always up and ready to go in the morning. She just asks I stop so she can buy coffee. You've taught your son a very valuable lesson that wouldn't have been learned if you let him stay home.", "Nta, he has to learn consequences to his actions. His consequence for staying up late was to be tired at school. Though I wouldn't have let mine sleep after getting home, he would have to finish homework and eat dinner first.", "NTA, there should have been no napping until after homework and chores.", "NTA.  My mom did the same thing to me when I was hopped up on energy drinks and was awake all night.  But it was my choice to drink the energy drinks, so I screwed myself over.  It's called consequences, and he's gonna learn quickly.", "nta- good thing you caught him in the act, otherwise he probably would've faked being sick!", "NTA.  Letting him stay home is tantamount to rewarding bad behavior. I agree with you that natural consequence are by far the best way to teach children things like this. When he is older, he probably wouldn\u2019t remember being grounded or losing iPad privileges in the same way he remembers being tired at school. Because when he is older, no one is going to take his iPad away for being bad, but he will suffer if he has to go to work tired.", "NTA has adults if we make the choice to stay up late we can\u2019t just not go to work kids need to learn as early as possible how real life works", "As a person who stays up too late for their own good, NTA.", "NTA, natural consequences and all!", "lol NTA, this kid will learn. Can't be missing work all the time in the real world when you are tired of your own doing.", "NTA. Consequences should be what happens when the \"misbehavior\" happens. \n\nSo you wanna stay up late, well buddy you gotta be tired at school now. \n\nWhen he's an adult no one will take away his electronics for using them inappropriately. That's why your wife's punishment doesn't actually work.", "Yeah NTA at all. Your wife's response is odd to me. Her punishment doesn't even sound bad at all. Back in my school days at that age I would have definitely given up entertainment for a week to not go to school for a day and stay up all night watching a show or playing games.", "NTA. Explain to your wife how schools work, he doesn\u2019t get a free pass for staying up late. If he had missed that day NONE of his teachers would allow makeup work for that reason. You need a drs note to get your work for the days missed\nSo you\u2019re only options were to make him go to school, let him stay home and get 0s for the day, or let him stay home take him to the dr for a checkup to get a note and teach him it\u2019s okay to lie to get his way.", "You're NTA. By her logic, he would have been rewarded for breaking the rules.", "NTA", "NTA. I find it very weird that your wife was thinking your son should've stayed home just because he was up late (and by his own choice). \n\nThe best punishment for your son is direct consequences to his actions. What would he learn if he was allowed to stay home, and lose iPad privileges as punishment instead? He'll learn to be more sneaky when he takes the iPad. And he'll learn he just has to stay up late to be able to skip school.\n\nEdit: I removed a bit. I shouldn't read the updated part before commenting, sorry.", "Also OPs job as a parent is to help prepare his son for the real world. When you\u2019re an adult with a job you can\u2019t call out because you stayed up late watching tv. The son made a poor decision and was probably regretting it all day. Hopefully he\u2019ll make smarter decisions because of that. NTA", "And it's her problem as well. Now she knows to not stay up all night doing something she wasn't supposed to. When it's a school night, there is a strict bedtime. On the weekend they can go to sleep anytime they please. My kids will not miss school simply because they decided to not follow the rules. Life is a series of actions and consequences for those actions.", "Yes but you're not just punishing your daughter, you're inconveniencing her teacher by making her attend lessons she is wholly unable to participate in due to being tired.  You're also probably disrupting the learning of every other child in your kid's class.", "Natural consequences are far more effective period IMO as no one is going to get hurt.", "Given the fact that her teacher had nothing to say about her behavior that day, I'm going to say that, it wasn't that serious as you're explaining it. But I totally hear you.", "That's good and perhaps she's the type of child that gets quiet when they are tired instead of disruptive.  I just know that I dread hearing parents say \"well, little Susie wouldn't sleep last night and was up at 3am have fun!\" before just chucking them into the classroom and heading on their merry way.", "Oh yea, I hear you totally. No, my daughter is hyper already, so when she's tired, she's very quiet.", "If I had a dollar for every time I had to go to school or work tired because I stayed up too late, I might not be a millionaire, but I'd f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*g be on my way there.\n\nNTA", "Definitely NTA. What did he learn?", "Same thing happened with one of my coworkers/good friends. \n\nHis daughter stayed up all night watching youtube or Netflix on her laptop, she was literally still watching when he came in to wake her up in the morning...\n\nHe sent her to school, and she also went straight to bed after coming home...\n\nGuess what hasnt been a problem ever since? Yep you got it, no issues with getting her off screens in the evening or getting her to go to sleep...", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m worried kids are getting soft if this is an actual concern", "NTA. I agree with your 'natural consequences' approach. I also love how you presented your wife. You sound like a great dad and husband.", "NTA. You did great as your son will learn that he is responsible for his obligations and well-being. If he was actually sick and not able to sleep so watched a film - sure, makes sense but he was fine and just wanted to watch a film. I had insomnia since I was 12 and I usually fell asleep at 2 am on good days and 4 am on bad days or not at all. My energy levels on any day varied but if I was okay at night and just stayed up longer because I read a lot - that was on me. I did that loads of times and my poor mother decided to ban that once and I organised a whole protest campaign with billboards everywhere. She gave in. I read as much as I wanted and the rest was up to me. But to be fair, my mum was the same with school so she trusted me with it thus I sometimes stayed at home as I wanted a break but if I did - that was still on me. Yeah, my mum was the parent for her parents when she was little and her mum was the same when she was little thus nobody got that parenting bit. Sounds great to just live with your best friend but it upsets stability and all.", "NTA. He learned a valuable lesson from experience. Letting him stay home would have rewarded his behavior, and one night of little sleep won't hurt him in the long run.", "NTA\n\nYou handled it exactly right. Actions have consequences and the natural consequence of staying up until 2am and getting only 4 hours sleep is feeling deathly tired the next day. Having to go to school and live with the consequences will have far more impact than rewarding him with a day off and then banning him from the iPad for a few days. Also what you did will have far less impact on his sleep cycle than allowing him to stay home and sleep most of the day, he would then not want to sleep until the early hours and the whole cycle starts again.", "Apple products have parental control settings built in. A proactive solution going forward could be to set \u201cdowntime\u201d settings on the iPad to make the device unusable after a certain time unless you enter a password. From what I can tell, you can make the downtime password different from the one to unlock it. I\u2019m not sure exactly how to do it, but you can prob google it."]}
