When the developer built the houses I live in, he planned to build another one on the end next to mine but could not get planning permission as the plot was to narrow 21 feet (about 2 \u00bd parking spaces wide) & there is no foot path on the side road. The space went undeveloped so people just parked on it as the street at the front has parking restrictions (max 2 hour stay) for none permit holders (none residents) and the nearest parking for longer is a pay and display car park about 5 to 10 minutes walk away. When I met my now wife who is a wheelchair user I asked my neighbours if they could leave the area closest to the path for her or at least leave extra space as she needed to open her door fully to get her chair in and out. All I got was it's not designated parking or a disabled space so shove off. They then made sure to use that area and or park no more than 6 inches from drivers door of her car so she had to park on street.   \n\nHere is where I maybe the AH the builder put the plot up for sale by auction and I bought it, put up signs and started issuing parking charges to every unauthorised vehicle i.e. not me or wife. Once neighbours stopped parking there I had it paved and a 3 foot fence built with electric gate.   Neighbours complained to council as I had not filed for planning permission but it was all covered by permitted development.   I should point out again that as a result of me blocking off this \u201cparking area\u201d that they had used for years anyone coming to visit my neighbours has a 5 to 10 minute walk from the nearest parking spot if they want to stay more that 2 hours (traffic wardens regularly patrol the road). Neighbours then sued me for stopping them using their parking spaces so I took them to court for not paying the parking charges they lost I won. Most people I know say I asked nicely first so did nothing wrong when acting less nicely but others say I should of given them a warning first or turned it in to designated parking. So I have a legal judgement but I would like a moral one so AITA for 1) sending my neighbour's parking charge notices for using the space they had always used 2) closing off the spaces knowing it would cause issues just because I could?", "created_utc": 1671467425, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zpw6x9/aita_for_taking_neighbours_parking_away/", "score": 138, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But basically, an owner who lets someone else use their property in some fashion, say, a beach house owner that has access to a private beach shared by the neighborhood lets neighbors use their path to get to that beach. If that owner abruptly blocks off the beach path, the people who had been using it for years may be able to get a court to find they have a constructive easement.\n\n\"Constructive\" because there was never any sort of signed agreement, but rather an implied one through the long term use that was previously allowed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh, and NTA.

Adverse possession means they actually own the land through their open, obvious, adverse (and whatever other elements are in the state).\n\nie, if a neighbor builds a shed a couple feet over your property line without permission but you don't do anything about it for ten years and then demand they move it, they have a good shot at convincing a court that they now own that property through adverse possession.\n\nThis is more about claiming a right to *use* the land to park.", "Yeah but I meant actual grounds.

Their neighbors are baffling.", "I get where you are going with constructive easement but where I am from, they would have had to take that up with the old property owner and do something before it was sold. Once it became OP property, he stopped the parking on the land from the get go, so there is no implied use between him and the people that were parking there. \n\nBasically OP purchasing it, resets everything, all previous arrangements are null and void. At least where I live.", "I am in the UK but you are correct about what adverse possession means but what I was stating was what they claimed on the papers they filed and the judge almost laughed at them at the hearing.", "They claimed that they owned the land but just forgot to tell the land registry. I bet you can't guess why they lost the claim against me?", "With absolutely 0 proof of an actual sale? That\u2019s so messed up, and doesn\u2019t make sense.", "I swear the judge had trouble stopping him self from laughing in their face. I think they were hoping when I received the papers I would back down and let them use the space.", "I\u2019d say it was karma for being douchey to a wheelchair user. NTA.", "NTA  Using a property that you own for your own purposes is not a moral issue.  I built a new fence around my property, which eliminated two large insets into my land along two alleys.  The tenants in the apartment buildings across the alleys parked in their driveways and overhung into the narrow alleys.  They could do this because the insets in my previous fence gave people using the pass-through alleys a place to drive around their cars.  \n\nThe owners of the apartment buildings immediately called the city, and inspectors came.  I had all my permits and my new fence meet the code.  At first, the tenants rammed my fence, one time so hard it knocked the sliding gate off the rail.  They believed they had a right to use this space on my property, so they could park in front of the garages and use the garages as storage.\n\nOn the other hand, other tenants and property owners along the alley came up and thanked me because now they didn't have to squeeze by these cars anymore.  (I eliminated one inset because I wasn't able to back my car out of the garage into the alley because they extended their cars out so far that I didn't have enough space to exit.)\n\nI never felt I was morally wrong to take back my land, so I could use it for my purposes.  It turns out I was legally right too.  \n\nNow some uses of land are deemed a moral issue.  This is legislated by law.  Parking is not immoral.", "You bought the land its yours.", "NTA", "It usually also requires payment of the property taxes by the adverse possessor."]}
