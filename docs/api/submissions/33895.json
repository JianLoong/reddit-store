Throwing it out the window was over the top. Your response should have been 1 of 2 things: \u201cThank you mom. I ask that you please try and remember I don\u2019t like these and stop bringing them to me.\u201d Then throw it out once she has left. The other (since my mother would do this to my brother every Easter with Cadbury Cr\u00e8me Eggs) \u201cMom, I get you absolutely LOVE these. You know I absolutely HATE them. Please stop using me as an excuse to buy yourself the treat, acting like it\u2019s a gift to me but you\u2019re just hoping I\u2019ll turn around and let you have them since I don\u2019t like them.\u201d Your mom is an AH because age is no excuse for \u201cforgetting\u201d that someone doesn\u2019t like something, especially when told yearly and likely more than once every year. Unless she has been diagnosed with dementia or something similar, she remembers just fine. Keep in mind that if she has the diagnosis, she shouldn\u2019t be bringing herself to your place to celebrate. Someone should be with her at all times to be helping her. If it\u2019s as I mentioned above that she loves the treat but doesn\u2019t want to be seen as \u201cgreedy\u201d or \u201cindulging too often\u201d so she buys it for the person who hates them so that she can simply do a \u201cI\u2019ll take care of them for you, nom, nom, nom\u201d type thing, that\u2019s a really crappy thing to do to someone. That\u2019s the equivalent of giving someone a gift then immediately taking it back for yourself.", "NTA\u2014sounds like that\u2019s what it took to make an impression on her, finally. Not only don\u2019t you like it, but there\u2019s no excuse for her to try to undermine your sobriety! \n\nI can maybe see forgetting a particular chocolate preference (*maybe*), but I\u2019m sure she doesn\u2019t forget that her daughter is an alcoholic who worked hard to stay sober for 4 years. Maybe she needs to get checked for dementia?", ">I'd like to add that I've been sober for about 4 years now and don't consume alcohol in any way, which she knows about and chose to ignore.\n\nOK, but it seriously didn't occur to you to put this in the post up front? It's like posting, \"Am I the asshole for yelling at my boyfriend because he got me a reservation at the wrong restaurant? ETA: It was a seafood place, seafood could literally kill me, and he knows that.\"", "Info: does your mom seem to remember other preferences and things like that?", "I sorta love this post. edit to NTA as now know OP is an alcoholic in recovery..", "ESH your actions are childish you should of just gave it back and refused to accept it and your mother seemingly intentionally giving presents you hate maybe because she likes it but it\u2019s expensive and she gives it to you so she can eat if", "NTA- unless you think she has dementia how many times is she going to bring you that candy which contains alcohol? Maybe next time she'll remember not to bring you that candy. And i wouldn't even do it all mad and stamping my feet, i'd say \"oh this candy i've told you multiple times not to bring me?\" And toss it out the window or open it and flush it down the toilet. Then offer her a cup of tea. She's tiresome.", "NTA for throwing it out.  YTA for neglecting to include important information, like you've been sober 4 years.  Giving alcohol to a recovering alcoholic is very difficult from giving it to a non-alcoholic.", "Soft yta, but I totally get it, I have a mother who my husband will ask, after spending any amount of time with her and me, if she has ever tried to know me as a person. Some days I say thank you to whatever dumb thing she brings me ( I hate clutter, she knows this.) And just donate it/ throw it away. And some days I just cannot handle the constant disregard for me as a person ( she will outright ask me if I want something, I will say no and she will then bring it and give it to my children who are too small to understand ) sometimes my soul is just too weary and I would love to throw that shit out a window\ud83e\udee0\ud83d\ude02\n\nEdited to add:  a hard your moms the ahole for never remembering this preference and your sobriety.", "Soft YTA. The thing to do in situations like these is take the present graciously and regift it to someone who would appreciate it more.", "YTA, just say, \"Mom I've told you many times I don't like this.\" Then don't eat it.

Her for knowing you do not consume alcohol and pushing it on you anyway and you for definitely overreacting.", "Assuming your mother is deliberately doing this to irritate you, ESH.

Without that knowledge you just sound like an insufferable ungrateful brat.", "NTA. She's done this for years, knowing your preference. I thought perhaps she had dementia but then I read that she remembers other preferences. Is she hoping you'll say thank you and offering to share with her? In any case this was a crummy thing to do. I can see that you were frustrated. I don't blame you.", "NTA. Seems like she is one of those people who gift things they like regardless of the receiver. Since I was a child, my mother has always commented negatively on my weight (I maintain weight in normal BMI but with difficulty) while trying to feed my fatty foods and sweets. I've asked her many times for years to not bring sweets for me to my house and she persisted. The only thing that slightly slowed her was telling her I just throw them away. But seriously she started again!", "YTA. You\u2019re 50, not 5. Act like it.", "NTA. I think you reacted brilliantly!", "NTA. I have people close to my heart who are in recovery and if someone kept giving them liqueur containing gifts, I can\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t just dump them in the trash if they were in my house.", "ESH - okay.

OP has been sober for 4 years, and her mother keeps giving her alcohol.", "I feel like I can relate to you so much. My mother used to do the same and always gift me the most useless stuff. Hundreds of useless advertisement books for children or in general just trash worthy free advertising articles. If I refused to take them, she would go to my kids who were unaware and naive. She would just talk them into keeping the stuff until I couldn't prevent them from taking everything home. Our house would end up with so much useless junk and it used drive me insane.

There are only so many times you can kindly say you don't appreciate something before you blow up.", "Oh I missed that part. I must change my response!", "Absolutely! She brings me things that have been sitting in her storage forever because she can't imagine just taking them to the thrift store, so then I have to either do it or throw it away myself. She works in retail so if shit goes on clearance, it's such a good deal \ud83d\ude43 that she buys it even if no one wants it. She'll tell me \" well it only cost me 1$ so I thought you'd like it\" \ud83e\udee0 we also just have completely different tastes so it's just a constant head shake of disbelief whenever she visits.", "No, it sounds like this was just the straw that broke the camel's back. She needed to see this to remember for next year hopefully. If you had held onto it to regift it she wouldn't know you didn't eat them, and it would have been a temptation around the house that could have hurt your sobriety. Next year if she gifts you the same thing you need to take her to see a doctor about her memory. If she needs to get you a gift maybe she can take you out to dinner, or get you a gift card or something else.", "The OP's edit about being sober was added after my post. Even still, throwing it out the window isn't the only option.", "B-fuckin-S. You left it out to make this post dramatic, and you know it.", "She edited the OP but it is vital info!", "How many times does OP have to go through this? I'm thinking it's at least 3x and after 3x i'm going to do whatever it takes to look out for my well being. I'd insist on a neuro exam too. Or maybe OP's mom has always been shitty like this. I do not think handing any kind of alcohol to someone in recovery is cute or just a little faux pas.", "Yep, \"burying the lede\" is not cool."]}
