And the whole time he was just kinda moping around and super off. He never addressed anything about it but my grandma just said they were going through something.Later that summer him he randomly asks me a question about my nose piercing and then pulls out a picture of agirl and shows me wondering about it.\n\nAnyways later in the year it came out that him and my aunt were getting a divorce but no one knew why. \n\nRoll around to last summer he shows up with his new girlfriend, the girl from the picture and who is 15 years younger than him. the whole weekend everyone was just shocked and confused as to what type of midlife crisis this man is going through o cheat on his wife and date someone 15 years younger than him and the cherry on top of all of it you ask? they are trying for a baby. after talking to more of my family i learned more tea about my uncle who has apparently cheated on my aunt before (not even sure if she knows) the man has been married three times before but for as long as i\u2019ve been alive my uncle has been married to my aunt. they have no kids together but he was a \u201cstepdad\u201d to her two kids from a previous marriage and raised them. however they ended up having a miscarriage together - their baby would have been the same age as me. \n\nANYWAYS this year we had ourreunion and he shows up with his gf and their new baby and basically the entire time i ignored his existence. anyways during one of the dinners he started very loudly talking to me asking \u201cwhat my issue was\u201d  he just kept going and obviously getting peoples attention. i finally was like \u201c im not gonna be like everyone else acting as of how you behave as a grown adult is normal, because it\u2019s not normal to cheat on ur wife of years and go through a bunch of IVF treatments with ur new girlfriend and pretend nothing happened\u201d he and his gf and baby ended up leaving early and everyone was angry at me. \n\nI feel how he has acted pretty much his entire life has just been swept under the rug by family. obviously i haven\u2019t been alive for a lot of his but 3 divorces and known for cheating. CLEARLY there is a pattern and while sure this isn\u2019t my thing to be involved in \u2014 i don\u2019t think him coming at me was fair and then blaming me for my honest response. I was ignorning him out of anger yes and also just because i didn\u2019t want any issues. While i know nothing i do or say will make him change or the situation any better. I am super frustrated by his behavior and my family\u2019s behavior by thinking we can\u2019t call ppl out for acting like idiots without learning! \n\nAITA???", "created_utc": 1681276859, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12jb4pl/aita_for_ignoring_my_uncle_at_a_family_reunion/", "score": 151, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He poked the bear by continuing to ask what your issue was, when you are able to talk to or to not talk to anyone you want.", "NTA\n\nHe recognized you wanted nothing to do with him and chose to get in your face about it. You matched his energy.", "NTA This reminds me of my family, don\u2019t let anyone break your spirit when you speak out like that, your feelings are valid & if he didn\u2019t want his business out there he shouldn\u2019t of asked you what\u2019s wrong. What did everyone expect you to do, Lie? you\u2019re an army of one I respect that. Your family just wants to keep the peace & live in La la land. They\u2019ll get over it because what you said was true.", "NTA he could have left you alone or asked you privately but know he had to be the center of attention and cause a scene. He started it not you. In my mind if you politely just ignore someone while interacting with others it\u2019s not a bad thing and heck it shows your maturity. I would ask the family if you were to lie? How was this your fault when he basically made sure everyone was watching instead of asking you like an adult somewhere else. Ask if they condone his cheating or you lying? If your family is religious and you are feeling super petty (I don\u2019t recommend this unless it gets bad) you might phrase it this way Adultery and bearing false witness is against the commandments. You could apologize for it coming to a head there however that was your uncles choice not to let it go.", "Don't want none?  Don't start none.", "NTA. He asked! If he didn't want you to answer honestly, he shouldn't have asked! He knew the problem & just wanted to start drama. He seems to really like creating problems that other people have to deal with.", "Yes.\n\nAll that ain\u2019t got nothing to do with you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That adds another weird layer. \n\nIf you are older . . . How much was him singling you out vs behaving this way with everyone? If he was singling you out then it sounds like he was picking a fight. He was just being an ass to everyone equally and you were the one giving him the stink-eye (deserved or not), hmmmmm. \n\nDoes the new mama know about all of uncle\u2019s drama or is she semi-innocent with just bad taste in men. \n\nListen, your uncle is definitely an AH, but as for you? Need more I N F O. \n\nMebbe just a little bit?", "I'm not answering, but does anyone get the feeling that the reason Uncle never showed up to reunions is because his wife didn't want to go. I mean, now he is happy to share time with his family since he has someone who actually wants to be involved.", "Nah you were minding your business. He asked you a question & you answered it truthfully! NTA", "NTA. He asked what your issue was. You told him your issue.", "NTA and i will get alot of negative points for this. \n\nINFO: Did he word it exaclty like ,,what was is your issue\u00b4\u00b4 or like in the lines of ,, have i offended you somehow with my words/actions against you?\\`\\` . So basically was he rude about it? when not maybe he just wanted to know if he did you wrong somehow.", "NTA. You were willing to ignore him but he chose to confront you. You unleashed on him and his low moral character.", "ESH. Your uncle certainly sounds like a piece of work, but your response also had an impact on everyone at the reunion.\n\nI have seen heated moments fracture families that take years to repair.", "ESH. I get that you disapprove of his life choices but what, really, do they have to do with YOU? What did he do to YOU to earn being ignored? What happened between him and his wife(s) is none of anyone else's business. You don't have to like his actions to still love someone and/or treat them with respect. Now, he shouldn't have come at you like that but, he wouldn't have had a reason to if you hadn't been ignoring him and, instead, acted like the young adult you are supposed to be and had a quiet conversation with him at the beginning letting him know that you aren't comfortable spending too much time with him because you have a conflict with his morals/values. A hard conversation but at least it would be a mature and honest one that would then allow you the space you want without making the entire family mad.", "YTA. You\u2019re judging him. Not your job. You don\u2019t have to respect him or his choices. But in these limited get togethers, you can be polite. He sounds immature and pretty thoughtless, but not everything needs to be said. Now there is a child involved who has no fault in any of this.", "NTA.  He could have spoken to you privately.  Instead he tried a power play by confronting you in a crowd.  It blew up in his face.  Good for you for not backing down.", "NTA, getting called out is the risk he took by acting appalling and then pretending not to know why you might be avoiding him", "Honestly Opie, you did the only sensible thing, you ignored the situation because it wasn't your battle to fight but your uncle he wanted to poke the bear and he wasn't ready for the bear to unleash the claws. NTA", "If it was because ex wife didn't want to go,  it may very well be that she didn't want to be around his family that obviously condones,  and apparently covers up his cheating behavior.", "YTA. Gossip is toxic. Families who gossip about family members are toxic. People who listen to gossip and believe it are toxic and that's you. You said you learned the tea about your uncle, no you gossiped about your uncle. You listened to busybodies and made a judgement on something you actually know nothing about except for their gossip. That really doesn't speak well of you. You are assuming he cheated based on gossip and because the ex didn't come with him a few years ago but maybe she cheated. You really don't know, you took gossip for truth and that makes you not very nice. \n\nA things before I go: \n- GOSSIP IS TOXIC & usually there's very little truth to it   \n- You and your family are gossips \n- Who TF made you judge and jury of your uncle?\n\nFinally  IF THEY GOSSIP WITH YOU, THEY GOSSIP ABOUT YOU.", "NTA. He was goading you arrogantly thinking you would back off. I applaud your honesty \ud83d\udc4f", "Okay wait, so OP is \"toxic\" for hearing the conversation between her family about the uncle?\n\nAND the uncle who is dating a 15!!! year younger \"girl\" is totally normal?\n\nHe asked OP last time they had a get together about some piercing and showed his (now new) \"girl\" as a reference... so we can assume he was already involved with that \"girl\" a year ago before he was divorced. That means it is pretty likely that he cheated or immediately started seeing this \"girl\" after the divorce was started while less fucked up still creepy. \n\nYes \"Gossip\" sucks and she maybe shouldn't have taken every word for granted but there is generally nothing wrong with trusting ur family when they tell OP something, like updates about said uncle... how should OP know that what family said might be a lie and that uncle is innocent. How can she trust uncles words? He might just spread gossip and lie to OP as well??", "I get you disapprove of Hitler's life choices but what did he do directly to YOU? he never interacted with you therefore you shouldn't hate him. See how quickly the argument falls apart", "You are judging OP right now as well and I doubt that AITA posts are your **job**.\n\nWe all judge people and their behaviour, uncle did things that OP doesn't like or approves of and ignored him to **not** start a conflict. He instead took it up to himself to go after OP and started to loudly and rudely questioning OP.\n\nOP did what they could to avoid conflict while not lying and accepting the horrible things uncle did. OP was asked to explain \"what their problem was\" and after uncle tried to embarrass OP by asking that infront of everyone he embarrassed himself.\n\nBTW just a question who is the child that is involved? OP because they seem pretty young or the new girl that the uncle is dating because apparently they seem to be close to the same age or the maybe future child of uncle and the new girl that they are maybe **planning** to have?", "That was a ridiculous comparison. There is a HUGE difference between a man who cheated on his wife and a man who committed mass genocide. Absolutely ridiculous.", "NTA \n\nYou ignored him - he could have gotten the hint. But he wanted to know (publicly!) so you told him.", "NTA. You just kept your distance and your mouth shut until He Chose to publicly confront you and you opened your mouth.\n\nAdd in narrators voice \u201cIt was at this moment he knew: he fucked up.\u201d", "NTA. He asked the question, you answered it, honestly.", "Your uncle was calling you out.  He was loudly asking you your issue while everyone was gathered for dinner.  He was trying to start shit.  He wasn't concerned about his relationship with you.  You did everything right.  You didn't initiate, but when asked (demanded of, really), you were truthful and candid.  You are completely undeserving of your upset family.", "nta, he asked, you answered", "of course their child is completely innocent and none of my issues with her dad would ever make me act differently to their baby. i actually get along with his new girlfriend and our babies are very close in age but it just weird knowing how their relationship came to be while my aunt is just left.", "Right? \n\nIf someone is a child-r\\*\\*\\*ist its fine because that person did nothing to YOU???? like how can you think like that... if someone does something morally wrong and you ignore it completely ur not any better then them!", "K I'll do a smaller scale comparison,\n\nYour sister's boyfriend cheats on her, then you see him in Walmart and he tries to talk to you, do you ignore him because of what he did or do you have a friendly conversation because what he did didn't effect you directly, because I can guarentee your not going to be friendly with the guy who cheated on your sister", "You have it backwards. The UNCLE was the family member. So, it would be your sister cheats on her boyfriend and then she sees you in Walmart and talks to you. Do you ignore your sister for what she did to her boyfriend or do you talk to her because she's your sister and what happened between them was BETWEEN THEM?"]}
