I told her it's such a royal name that it's a negative for me anyway but it doesn't sound like the kind of name I would want to give my child some day. Then I asked her why she was so uncertain and she said part of it was the royal connection. Another part of her wanted something that felt a bit more fresh and not as popular.

If she'd loved the name, what you said wouldn't have made her change her mind, you were very clear that it wasn't a name you'd give your kid but you didn't care if she named her kid that.\n\nNTA", "Try an app- Kinder and BabyName work like Tinder, where you swipe left or right to reveal names you both like. A gamified approach may feel less contentious. Plus the nature of the process means you\u2019re only discussing names you both already like.", "NTA. It sounds like Michael needs to insulate Jessie from outside opinions so he can maintain the ability to steamroll her.", ">Your sister had the name under consideration. That alone is a reason to maintain at least some sense of neutrality while still giving your opinion.\n\nThat doesn't really help someone when they're asking for advice, especially when they ask for your honest opinion, double especially when they ask you knowing you have a more negative opinion. I mean, the sister specifically brought up OP's past statements, so it's not like she didn't know how OP felt and what was said about the name. If I was deciding between something and I knew person A was more neutral and person B had a more negative opinion, I would go to person A if I wanted neutrality. The sister says she was still deciding, but she admitted to have been leaning more toward choosing no, and it's pretty clear she went to OP to have the confidence to voice her own negative opinions. \n\n>You went wrong with \"It's kind of ugly\" and \"Not the type of name I'd choose for my child.\"\n\nI agree that the ugly comment was unnecessary compared to other, less negative things OP said, but there's nothing negative about saying you wouldn't give your child that name. Everybody has different tastes, and it's not offensive to not like something someone else likes. I love unique, unisex names, but if someone said \"yeah, Lynn's just not a name I would use for my kid\" I wouldn't be offended.", "Me either! I thought Curious George!", "George of the jungle!", "Seigmoraig Georgecostanza?", "Prince George is 2nd in line for the throne. Barring catastrophe, he will become king in 40 or 50 years (William is already in his 40s). So while King George live, reigned, oversaw the American Revolution, went mad, and died a couple hundred year ago - there is likely to be a new King George during your nephew's lifetime. Entertainingly, the name derives from the Greek for \"farmer\".", "Super true. We have twins and basically agreed we'd each name one (still taking the others feelings into account of course) and I was between 2 names. My husband preferred Name 1 before they were born, but he came back from the NICU and was like, \"oh he's definitely a Name 2\"", "Matthias like the apostle from 50 AD?\n \nYeah that's fresh and less stuffy than George. \n \nEven been attached to a European king.", "Sort of. They both find older names appealing; hers are just a *bit* less common and are actually more ancient. Rafael and Matthias are biblical. Julian is an ancient Roman emperor. Alec is a \"fresh\" take on Alexander, which goes back to at least Alexander the Great, another ancient ruler.\n\nIt's not like Sister isn't looking at your \"Brayden\" and \"Hunter\" category of names, or wants to name her kid \"Sunshine\" or \"Cinnamon\" or something.\n\nIt feels like it shouldn't be that hard for them to find a name that they both really like.", "I'm very much in your sister's camp.  (I did name one of mine Braden, but that was over 30 years ago when the name was considered pretty weird.)  \n\nI wonder if they're not able to compromise because the BIL refuses to consider anything beyond George."]}
