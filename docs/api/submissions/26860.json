They have struggled to decide on a name for their son and they asked some family members what they thought of their top contender; George. Nobody wanted to give an opinion on it. Michael was 100% on board but Jessie was not. She was feeling pretty down and came to me and told me she was struggling to say whether she wanted to go ahead and use the name George or not. She said nobody would give her a straight answer on what they thought and she wanted to know if I would. She brought up that a few years ago I had commented that I wondered why people would give their son such an old man name when I heard of Price George being named that. She wanted to know if my feelings had changed on the name or whether I still felt that way.\n\nI asked her if it would really help her to discuss it with someone else and she said yes. I admitted that I still felt that way. She asked was it just the old man thing and I also admitted I found the name kind of ugly. I told her it's such a royal name that it's a negative for me anyway but it doesn't sound like the kind of name I would want to give my child some day. Then I asked her why she was so uncertain and she said part of it was the royal connection. Another part of her wanted something that felt a bit more fresh and not as popular. She admitted the name seemed to go from being kind of old man only to wildly popular overnight after the royals had their baby.\n\nShe said she does like the name itself but part of he doesn't like it too. She asked if I would be angry if she decided to use it anyway, even after pushing me to tell her the truth and I was like of course not, this is your baby after all. I told her I wasn't even sure if giving her such an honest opinion was the right thing to do. But I hated seeing her feel so defeated and wanted to help. She thanked me and told me she appreciated it.\n\nOur family got together to celebrate Michael's birthday on Sunday and he confronted me about my honesty on the name. He said he knew it was me who changed my sister's mind and got her to take George off the table because nobody else said a thing about the name. He said I interfered where it wasn't my place and should never have made my sister think a member of the family would hate the name. I told him she came to me and was desperate for someone to answer her and that's what I did. I told him he might not like it but he should want her to be good with whatever name they pick for their son.\n\nHe said it was still an ugly thing to do to my pregnant sister when I know she likes the name.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694707319, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16im7qz/aita_for_being_honest_with_my_sister_about_not/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
