She is my sister on my dad side and we barely see each other. This year we stayed at my grandmothers house for a couple weeks. In those few weeks prior (I was there before she got there) I brought a new iPhone 13 and a Apple Watch. When my sister came she wanted to get a new phone to so she tried to get one but they wouldn\u2019t let her so I told her she can get on my plan if she agrees to plan her part of the phone bill. ( She got a iPhone 13 and a Apple Watch) fast forward one month it\u2019s time to pay I\u2019ll phone bill and she has a problem paying it. So I was made because I needed my phone on because I use it for school. She told me she wasn\u2019t paying the bill because she recently found out she was pregnant with twins so her money was going towards them ( which I had no problem with) so I told her to give me the phone and the watch back if she wasn\u2019t going to pay the bill and she hasn\u2019t. She blocked my number so I had no way of contacting her. So two months past by and my phone has been off for two months. I got a letter in the mailbox saying my bill is now $2,587. So I found my sister on facebook and told her about the letter and say she needs to give me half the money or give me the phone back. She blocked me again without responding. I text her mom and told her to tell my sister she has a couple days to give me the money or the phone and watch or I was going to the police. Still got no response. It has been two weeks with no contact from them.
