You were right; a dad doesn't babysit, he parents.

His wife deserves a partner, not a babysitter.\n\nthanks OP for being one of the good ones. Your ~~mom~~ parents raised you and your brother right!", "NTAs. Was the delivery harsh? Yes. But it seems that it was needed. If your brother wants to he can apologise for his manner of telling the truth.\n\nAnd yes fatherhood is stressful, so is motherhood with the added physical recovery.

Frankly, a good friend's job sometimes involves handing your ass to you when you deserve it, and J deserved it.

Thank you for holding other fathers accountable!", "[deleted]", "NTA you are absolutely right he isn't babysitting he is doing his Dad duty.", "What your brother said was satisfying to read.

My parents babysit. My grandparents babysit. My other family members babysit. My HUSBAND does not babysit. He\u2019s the parent, he\u2019s just being with his child. Just like when I\u2019m home with the baby, I\u2019m not babysitting, it\u2019s my baby.", "Neither of you are AHs. I love how angry your brother got tbh.

Obviously, your friend needed to hear it from someone outside his family.

Well done to you and your brother.", "Ahahahahaha you're NTA for sure, my dude. You said exactly what everyone else in the car was thinking.", "NTA sounds like you both gave him the sharp wake up call he needed", "NTA I am a dad and I hate hearing people say that. No one pays me $10 an hour to watch those two it\u2019s my responsibility that I chose for fucks sake. Maybe your bro can say sorry for snapping, but friends tell you the truth and the truth is Dads have responsibilities and that means being there when your needed.
