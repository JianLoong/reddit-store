I love you guys , choose violence...", "When we were your age our friend group had a very similar reckoning and it was necessary, the guy in question is a much better father although I will say, it completely fractured the group as a result.", "NTA \n\nFrom someone who's partner works full time but is still throwing me out of the house next Wednesday and being daddy on duty for our 3 month old.", "Now NTA , just glad he was told this early on. Probably gonna make his wifes life a little easier", "NTA. Bravo!!!!", "NTA nothing burns more than a persons attitude that they're babysitting their own kids like they shouldn't also consider themelves to be the parent.", "NTA\n\nYou & your brother are awesome! You both gave him a reality check - which he needed!!\n\n\ud83c\udfc6\ud83e\udd47\ud83c\udfc6", "Dude men need friends like you. You checked him out on his behaviour and he didn\u2019t like y\u2019all just didn\u2019t support his dumb comments. Acting like the extra kid in the family. \n\nNTA but that guy sure is", ">spending 4 hours out with us playing fucken 40k\n\nINFO, what is everyone's army?", "A lot of women's problems would be solved easily if only men always call out men", "Seriously. That attitude ruins marriages, and maybe getting called out by his friends will help him nip it in the bud.", "Your statement that men need to call out men, yes, exactly. It does not happen enough! Good on OP for starting it, and great on big brother for finishing it. I feel a great way to move forward on this sitch is if all the guys get together and gently explain to J, was it? that fathers are just as much the parent as mothers and they should be taking that role more seriously. I hope he grows rather than resents from this experience.", "NTA. Was it harsh yes but it's needed. Actually J needs to thank you for saving his relationship. This kind of behaviour from men is what causes resentment in relationships and leads to divorce. Good on you both for calling out his shitty approach towards parenting his child as if he is doing a huge favor. If only more buddies did this.", "I agree with everything you are saying. But I think if both partners call it babysitting when one of them goes out for the night and the other stays then it's totally fine. It depends on what each couples call it.", "Brotherly love is a step above tough love at times - really hits the spot", "I do love a good sibling tag-team. Sounds like OP set his brother up for the spike.", "Absolutely what I was expecting. \n\nEither that or something like... J and C got together when the kid was a baby, and now the kid is somewhere aged 5-10, has always just known  J as their dad, all J's friends know but have agreed to not bring it up because it's not their business... but OP actually never knew either and she just found out because J mentioned something in passing (because HE thought that OP did know and was in on the secret too), so this was her blurting it out in shock, but the kid overheard it, and it unleashed the Big Family Secret\n\n\n*catches breath*", "It\u2019s her brother, but yeah what army?", "He was making a sarcastic comment since I kept calling it babysitting. It\u2019s Js kid, therefore its parenting, not babysitting", "I think you may have commented on the wrong post, but I now have to go figure out what post it was for?", "I\u2019m definitely in agreement with you being NTA here, but I wanted to suggest a response. \n\nI reckon instead of ignoring this guy or doubling down on criticism, try to bring him into the fold by conveying something like \u201chey, we had to call out the double standard in the way you were talking about your wife, but I want you to know that we see that being a Dad is stressful, we\u2019ve got you and your families back. When things are tough, let\u2019s try to talk about it honestly rather than falling into patterns of blaming and reducing ourselves and others to stereotypical roles\u201d\n\nConversations like this among men can go a long way to address internalised patriarchy and shift the burden of managing men\u2019s unprocessed feelings away from women. Just my two cents, whatever you do good luck and great job on calling out this BS.", "NTA you and your brother were both right - and look, even if the dad is going 50/50 on childcare while it is stress being a new dad, it is FAR MORE stress being a new mom because their bodies were just hugely impacted by childbirth and now they\u2019re trying to heal on little sleep!", "Honestly, you probably did him a favour. Either he learns from this and it improves his marriage or he\u2019ll never learn.", "Good on ya, my hubby would of and has said the same thing to a few of his buddies over the years. Parenting is a partnership,  babysitting is what the teenager in the neighborhood do so couples can get a night out together.", "NTA - Dude needed to get over himself, wife deserves to go out and have a bit of fun too. Woman's a saint to put up with weekly Warhammer games. \ud83e\udd2a  Hopefully J starts realizing a partner shares the work load, and sure sometimes it sucks to miss out on something because of scheduling conflicts, but darn it sometimes it's good to sit and bond with the kiddo before they know it kiddo isn't gonna want them around. \ud83e\udd23\n\nGive brother a thank you from Reddit for laying down the truth for his friend to see. \u270a", "NTA X infinity", "This is how we learn things. We've all had ideas screwed up in our heads and those of us who are luck and have friends like you benefit from you holding up a mirror to let us get a look at reality.\n\nThat was a lesson worth paying the shame for. If he learns from it then he won't be bothered by it for long. If he doesn't, then it'll keep replaying from time to time until he does.\n\nYou did a good thing and so did your brother. Go out to dinner or something. NTA", "NTA (nor is your brother in any way) and kudos to both of you", "Missed the point", "It would definitely still be the inner misogyny rather than misandry, since it\u2019s the patriarchal system is what expects us to think that only the mother would be an active parent rather than both", "while i appreciate your sentiment, misandry is a prejudice against men; my inference that it was the mother who is responsible for her sons healthy and positive attitude about parenting was prejudicial. while the patriarchy is alive and well, the landscape hasn't changed *just* because of women; it shouldn't be knee jerk to assume dads aren't involved. not anymore. \n\ni'm not saying you're wrong, it's just semantics, friend, but I stand my calling it misandric because that's what i feel it was, and i want to own that.", "Can I just say that seeing someone (on reddit no less!) Being not only self-aware, but self-aware enough to recognize misandry is really nice. Too many people are content thinking that only misogyny or only misandry exist, when they are in fact both alive all over the world and both need to be snuffed out", "True. They are both largely connected, though."]}
