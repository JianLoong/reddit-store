Since I was going to be away for a few days the following week (this week), I thought it would be a good thing for him to go, since for the days I was gone he\u2019d be taking care of our 4 kids on his own. So, I encouraged him to go have some fun with his buddies.\n\nHe came home Sunday night and told me a lot about how great it was, what his friends were up to, etc. He then glossed over the detail that the car was a little dirty. Monday morning (I had to get to work and get the kids to school), I opened the garage and the car was completely filthy with much of the lower half covered in mud.\n\nI was disgusted but didn\u2019t think too much about it since I was in a rush. I opened the door, and somehow the interior was even dirtier than the outside. Since I\u2019m the primary driver of the family car, I always keep it super clean, so I was quite irritated at this.\n\nOnce I dropped off the kids and got to work, I texted my husband about the situation. He apologized profusely and said he\u2019d get it cleaned while I was on my work trip (Tuesday \u2013 Thursday).\n\nI got back last night and saw the car was still dirty. I mentioned it to my husband and he apologized again, saying that he\u2019d get it cleaned this weekend after he goes out with his friends.\n\nI was tired from my trip and very frustrated, so I told him that he would not be spending any more time with his friends until the car was clean. I think he thought I was joking because he didn\u2019t act serious about it. When I reaffirmed that he would not be going out, he acted surprised and said that I couldn\u2019t be serious.\n\nLater that evening, he was talking on the phone with two of his friends, talking about how they were looking forward to this weekend. My husband typically talks on speaker phone so when I heard, I walked into his office and told his friends that he wouldn\u2019t be able to make it this weekend until he finished some responsibilities.\n\nMy husband looked so surprised by this and one of his friends asked him to confirm and he just said \u201cApparently I am grounded\u201d. This morning he told me how embarrassing it was that I would say that to his friends, but I told him that he decided not to get the car cleaned and he also said the word \u201cgrounded\u201d.\n\nNeedless to say, he isn\u2019t going out until the car is clean. I think he might be upset with me and I\u2019m starting to feel conflicted.\n\nAITA?\n\nContext: For those wondering, my husband has a sedan that he uses as his personal car.

The term \u201cgrounded\u201d is often used in a parent child situation. Your husband used it-because on some level he realized he was acting like a child. \n\nBut, damn, he took your car, trashed it, promised to clean it, didn\u2019t clean it for *days*, and then expected to be off lallygagging with his *literally* filthy little friends, still without cleaning your ordinarily pristine car. Oh, hell no. \n\nHe was waiting for you to clean it. You know that\u2019s what he was doing. \n\nAnd by playing the \u201cI\u2019m grounded\u201d card, what? was he expecting you to be embarrassed or sorry that you said something? Again. Oh, hell no. NTA", "NTA.\n\nIt's unfortunate that your husband is behaving like an elementary school kid.\n\n1.  He trashed the inside and outside of the car.\n2. He said he would clean it up and he did not\n3. He had ample time to take it to get detailed or detail it himself\n4. Severe lack of respect for you and the kids.\n5. Even if you are OCD about the car, he acknowledged and made commitments to clean up the mess.\n6. If he's bright enough, he'll realize he won't get the car in the future if he doesn't take care of his messes.", "NTA. \n\nThe entire time I was reading this, I couldn't believe you would tell your husband he can't see friends and also tell his friends he couldn't go out until he finished his \"responsibilities.\"\n\nBut what is harder to believe is that a grown man couldn't 1) alert you upon coming home that the car was really dirt, 2) figure out with other adults how to keep the car from getting THAT dirty, 3) not be able to get the care cleaned over an entire week. \n\nYour husband has failed at basic adulting- hey babe, we got the car super muddy, I'll be taking it in tomorrow to be cleaned. I'd never want to treat my partner this way- ordering him around- but I also wouldn't want to be with someone who can't accomplish basic tasks in a timely matter, or even understand that those things need to be done at all until they are pointed out.", "NTA for obvious reasons how hard is it for your husband to clean a car wtf? Common courtesy there\u2019s car washes every 5 miles nowadays", "NTA he could have gotten off the phone & immediately start to clean the car. He is screwing around waiting for you to get sick of it being dirty & clean it yourself. He is acting like a child so you are treating him like a child.", "NTA. He's a grown man acting like a kid. The fact he used the term 'grounded' shows he has the mentality of a scolded teen, and is not serious about cleaning the car for you to be comfortable driving it. I think it's massively disrespectful that the car is filthy inside and out because he went out in it and he is dragging his heels cleaning it so his wife and kids don't have to sit in a filthy car. The woman having to be the only adult in a nuclear family is a trope that needs to end. NTA NTA NTA.", "NTA . how unsurprising his friends don't hold him to a higher standard . you did what you thought was right by forcing him to do as he told you he would . if he never intended to clean it , he should have just said so upfront - then you'd know for sure he's an asshole .", "NTA. I get so tired of \u201cbeing busy with work\u201d as an excuse. Everyone is freaking busy. Literally, pretty much everyone. If you mess something up, it is your duty to fix it. Do not let him get away with doing a crappy job of it either. It should be the way he received it or better. I have no problem with you \u201cgoing full mom\u201d on him while on the phone, because you asked him kindly and respectfully before and he didn\u2019t do it. Let him pout about being called out in front of his friends. He should have been a respectful spouse and never have returned the vehicle trashed.", "NTA: If he's going to act like a child he gets treated like a child.

Some men never grow up and take responsibility.  I mean he trashed it and he NEEDS to clean it NOW.", "ESH your husband is a grown man, you can't ground him or force him to do anything. You can be pissed at him for neglecting his responsibility and rightly so but if my wife told me i cant go out with my friends i would laugh my ass off then again i would never do that to my wife so maybe thats why.", "Wtf is he your husband or your child??!! I understand you are upset and frustrated by his lack of following through on cleaning the car, but cmon, what kind of relationship is this where you literally tell your husband what he can and cannot do like you are his mom?? Personally I would want a relationship where myself and my husband just made good choices and did the right thing because we love and respect one another and want what is best for our family. If it got to the point where I felt I had to control him and make his decisions for him then he wouldn\u2019t be my husband anymore because I would have left him because of his lack of commitment to a happy relationship or he would have left me because of my controlling and condescending behavior. And if you weren\u2019t really serious about demanding him to stay away from his friends until he completed this task, which it seems like you were, you are purposely embarrassing him in front of his friends as a way to manipulate his behavior to your liking. So yeah, it\u2019s a hard YTA from me.", "ESH.\n\n\nYour husband obviously sucks for making a mess of the car, not fixing it and not keeping his word.\nYou suck for essentially treating your husband as a kid. \"Act like a kid, get treated like a kid\", no. Your husband is an adult and you are supposed to be equals in this relationship. If one of you slips up, you have a conversation about it like adults and figure out why things are going wrong, as a team. What you don't do is elevate yourself to lord some non-existent power over him.\nIt sets a precedent for a fucked up dynamic you do not want to be part of.\n\n\nHe should take responsibility for his messes out of (mutual) respect, not because you told him or else he won't be allowed to go out and play.", "YTA for grandstanding.  I\u2019m with you that he needs to clean it but you lost me when you both \u201cbanned\u201d him from going and interrupted his conversation to bring his friends into the disagreement.  Being a rude controlling AH isn\u2019t a moral high ground for such a mundane issue.", "Seriously what is he a petulant teenager? Get the car cleaned you asshat it\u2019s not that hard. NTA.", "He\u2019s going to keep putting it off until you take care of it.  His fun time should not at your expense and he needs to it be such an AH.  NTA", "NTA.

Clean up your mess, bro.", "NTA, if your husband wants to act like a child he\u2019ll get treated like a child.", "NTA\n\nSeriously, instead of not doing it, why doesn\u2019t he just go clean the car so he\u2019s no longer grounded? He wants you to just get fed up and do it for him.", "You stated \u201c until he finished his responsibilities\u201d. He had apparently three opportunities to clean the car. Cleaning the dirty car after a fishing trip is a responsibility. \n\nHe said \u201cApparently, I am grounded.\u201d When he takes care of his responsibilities he is in the clear. And lives up to his word. His choice of phase is interesting. \nNTA.

If he had cleaned the car in the beginning, there wouldn't  have been any issue. But no, he had to act like a child so he gets treated like a child.", "Part of a good relationship is doing what you say you'll do. He's not an AH for dirtying up the car--sounds like he had a good time wherever he was. But he is totally the AH for not cleaning it when he said he would. He needs to get his $#it together and act like an adult. Until then, I think you get to treat him like a child. You are NTA. I'd be royally ticked, too.", "NTA. \n\nHe wants to act like an irresponsible teenager, then he gets treated like one. \n\nWho takes someone's car and brings it back in that condition knowing that his own kids get into that car to get to go to school? He could have easily taken the car to a car wash before coming home.", "NTA. He is waiting for you to clean up HIS mess. He got the car interior filthy, he repeatedly told you he would clean it (without saying \"in the fullness of time.\") and then wanted to run off and go have fun because why would he want to spend any of his non-work time cleaning? He made the mess AND said he would get it cleaned and is surprised you're upset and not just taking care of it for him. \n\nA whole group of grown men got mud INSIDE a car and are subsequently flabbergasted you are upset about it? Did no one look at themselves or think about what they were up to? No one said, \"Hey maybe we should put some trash bags or tarps over the seats so we don't trash this car?\" \n\nYour husband couldn't be bothered to drive it through a wash so the outside at least was better in the three whole days you were gone. You don't have more time than he does. You both have the same 24 hours in a day.", "ESH...", "NTA\n\nHonestly, how hard is it to take a car somewhere for a cleaning...?  That isn't a very big ask, especially after getting it dirty during a trip...\n\nWould be about an hour or two depending on exactly how dirty is dirty...", "NTA. He and his buddies made the mess, so he can clean it up.", "NTA. He's behaving like a child. Many supermarkets now have a valet service in the car park; drop it off, fork over the cash, wander off for a coffee, and come back later. It's almost stupidly easy, he just couldn't be bothered. My bet is that he was waiting for you to get annoyed enough to do it yourself.", "Man... please reread what you just wrote. You have to effectively \"ground\" your husband in order for him to clean up after himself (and his friends)? You have five children, not four.

If he\u2019s going to act like a child, he\u2019ll get treated like a child, and having sex with a child is gross.  NTA.  You need to go on strike and girl, set aside that guilty feeling.  Don\u2019t let him manipulate you into second guessing yourself.", "YTA. You can be mad, but you can\u2019t tell an adult he can\u2019t go out with his friends.

He needs to get that car cleaned but you ARE grounding an adult human which is a power play that won't end with anything other than resentment or conflict. \n\nNow if instead you had taken HIS car as the family car while he has to use the trashed one, or you refused to compensate for his plans or do him any favors that would be a reasonable response, but telling him he can't go out then intentionally asserting authority over your partner to his friends was a crazy and escalatory move.", "Jesus - disrespectful husband much?

Obviously you had a right to be upset, but you don't have the ability to tell your partner \"he would not be spending any more time with his friends until the car was clean.\" That's not how adult life works, even if the car was entirely yours (and it isn't).

It sounds like that's his intention but couldn't get around to it since I'm assuming he's working during the week and has the kids by himself during your business trip. Might be kinda tough to find a free couple hours to do that. Maybe he overestimated his bandwidth. \n\nI can see how you might feel that his first priority with his free time should be to clean the car rather than seeing his friends, but instead of cutting him off at the knees, maybe tell him how you feel. Tell him you don't want to drive to work in a filthy car again and that you'd appreciate it if he could make that a priority. Outright telling him what he will do with his time is controlling, and you as his partner do not have authority to order him around or punish him. It's not a healthy dynamic.", "ESH - He for obvious reasons, but your coercive control isn\u2019t good either; he\u2019s an adult, not your child.", "I would have got it valeted and given him the bill .", "ESH.  Your husband was inconsiderate, for sure.  And he was basically lying to you about rectifying a situation he recognized was crappy for you.  However, you treated him like your child and that is also AH behavior.  You are not his parent to tell him if he can use your joint property.  You are not his parent to police his weekend activities.  Ever hear 2 wrongs don\u2019t make a right?  A more respectful approach would have been to talk to him about it and let him know what your boundaries are.  Those boundaries are not that you now get to control him.  This is an excellent way to build resentment, which he is now displaying.  And he has every right too.  Again, he was not in the right, but are also not in the right.", "Yes mom YTA!", "YTA", "ESH. Of course he's wrong for not cleaning the car, that much is obvious. But unless you are cool with your husband telling you what you are or are not going to do, you don't get to \"ground him\".

You have every right to be upset/frustrated at his lack of being an adult, but your manner in which you're getting your point across is absolutely terrible. You belittled and embarrassed him. I would be livid if I were him. \n\nHe is 100% wrong to not only have made the mess, but also not cleaned it up in the timeframe he stated. But 2 wrongs don't make a right, and the way you handled this was terrible.", "There\u2019s an argument that you should keep your relationship issues between you two.

Then she doubled and tripled down on it, escalating the situation by humiliating him in front of his friends.\n\nI'm not defending husband, and OP has every right to be angry. But acting like she has the right to order him around isn't the way. \"Oh come on! The car's been filthy for a week and a half. I really need you to get it cleaned up before this weekend.\" Or even \"FFS, you've been promising to clean the car for a week and a half.

On what grounds do you dictate his choices?? That\u2019s insanely controlling and it\u2019s not excused by him being an ass about the car. \n\nIt sounds like you have an overarching dynamic in your marriage where he acts like a child and you treat him like one. That\u2019s really unfortunate for both of you. \n\nBy all means, be super pissed he hasn\u2019t cleaned the car. Decide you\u2019re not doing anything for him until he cleans it.

Okay. Here's the thing. Your husband might be acting childishly, but he's not a child. He's an adult. Which means that you just can't outright tell him what he can and can't do. That includes going out with friends even if there is cleaning to be done. By telling him that he can't do something until the car is cleaned, you're being a control freak. Which is why I suggest you get over yourself and stop acting like you have the right to treat your partner like that.", "YTA I get that you had feelings, and he didn\u2019t do as well as he should, but treating him like your 5th child is shitty.

Tell him what you will or won't be doing if he doesn't clean the car, tell him how you will treat him and the relationship differently if he doesn't live up to his responsibilities and treat you with the respect you want. Then he, an adult with agency, can decide how he wants to act and treat you given that information. Show your kids how adults communicate and how people show respect for others.", "ESH. \n\nYou, because one does not  \u201cground\u201d their partner in the way of a parent.  You don\u2019t apply disciplinary actions to your *spouse*! Yes, your husband most certainly acted like a child in need of discipline, but I cringed at the way you spoke to him, especially with his friends as witnesses. You totally shamed and embarrassed him. \n\nHe obviously has some work to do on being a functional adult, to put it mildly. I would have absolutely blown a gasket if I had come out to my normally-clean car looking like it made a swamp run, given that the husband should have cleaned it up before ever coming home. \n\nAnd I would have gone nuclear on my spouse if I returned and the car was still dirty, and he was still procrastinating. What I wouldn\u2019t have done is treat my husband like a child for his failures, because he isn\u2019t, and neither is yours. If you want a partnership with an adult you need to treat him as such; otherwise, he will continue to act like a child and make child-like decisions.

Since I was going to be away for a few days the following week (this week), I thought it would be a good thing for him to go, since for the days I was gone he\u2019d be taking care of our 4 kids on his own. So, I encouraged him to go have some fun with his buddies.\r\n\nHe came home Sunday night and told me a lot about how great it was, what his friends were up to, etc. He then glossed over the detail that the car was a little dirty. Monday morning (I had to get to work and get the kids to school), I opened the garage and the car was completely filthy with much of the lower half covered in mud.\r\n\nI was disgusted but didn\u2019t think too much about it since I was in a rush. I opened the door, and somehow the interior was even dirtier than the outside. Since I\u2019m the primary driver of the family car, I always keep it super clean, so I was quite irritated at this.\n\nOnce I dropped off the kids and got to work, I texted my husband about the situation. He apologized profusely and said he\u2019d get it cleaned while I was on my work trip (Tuesday \u2013 Thursday).\r\n\nI got back last night and saw the car was still dirty. I mentioned it to my husband and he apologized again, saying that he\u2019d get it cleaned this weekend after he goes out with his friends.\r\n\nI was tired from my trip and very frustrated, so I told him that he would not be spending any more time with his friends until the car was clean. I think he thought I was joking because he didn\u2019t act serious about it. When I reaffirmed that he would not be going out, he acted surprised and said that I couldn\u2019t be serious.\r\n\nLater that evening, he was talking on the phone with two of his friends, talking about how they were looking forward to this weekend. My husband typically talks on speaker phone so when I heard, I walked into his office and told his friends that he wouldn\u2019t be able to make it this weekend until he finished some responsibilities.\r\n\nMy husband looked so surprised by this and one of his friends asked him to confirm and he just said \u201cApparently I am grounded\u201d. This morning he told me how embarrassing it was that I would say that to his friends, but I told him that he decided not to get the car cleaned and he also said the word \u201cgrounded\u201d.\r\n\nNeedless to say, he isn\u2019t going out until the car is clean. I think he might be upset with me and I\u2019m starting to feel conflicted.\r\n\nAITA?\r\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Nah, no time for that. \nAt this point it\u2019s weaponized incompetence. He\u2019s definitely waiting for her to cave and either let him go or clean the car herself.\n\nOverall It\u2019s unfair to OP that she has to boss him like a secretary.

However, I would say that it's highly likely that he only took OP's vehicle because it is bigger and possibly 4WD or AWD. A sedan is about the shittiest vehicle you could possibly take on a fishing trip and most likely wouldn't fit all of your gear. Again, not an excuse for his shitty behavior in not cleaning the car, but I think there's a good chance that taking OP's car may have been the only option. \n\nOP also may not have had the option to take husband's sedan depending on the age of their four kids. Transporting four kids in a sedan safely isn't really possible if the kids are young and you have multiple car seats or boosters. If that's the case, it makes the husband even more of an inconsiderate asshole for not cleaning the car.", "[removed]", "Only if I choose to use it.

How is that a solution? That's him forcing his own way and making her do his work, and then she still ends up looking just as bad for 'nagging him for his money'. While in the meantime everyone criticizes women for treating their husband's like checkbooks or being gold diggers if they want money from them. \n\nThat's bullshit.
