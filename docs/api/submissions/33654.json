She told me I\u2019m a \u201cvery selfish little girl who only cares about what I\u2019m eating for breakfast and not about the family\u201d. I felt this was an extreme and hurtful reaction for the crime of asking if I could get myself a glass of orange juice.

This is not really about orange juice, it is about a pattern of abusive behavior you have noticed. You asked a reasonable question, and were called names and shouted at in return for your consideration.\n\n\nI agree with both the above poster who suggested you consider spending the holidays elsewhere, and the one who suggested you check out r/raisedbynarcissists.

Who the hell has a guest and then does not have enough groceries in for the days before Christmas.", "NTA while I can understand your mother being iffy cause it's xmas and she probably wants the dinner to go perfectly and maybe there's other factors too, but that doesn't mean she can go off on you for asking, and continue when you've moved on. You did the logical thing in your situation by asking what was allowed.\n\nIf this is repeated behavior from her, I can guess she'll probably explode if you do take back the gifts so be mentally prepared for that if you go that route (would be worth it imo though)", "NTA. Return her presents and get her more orange juice instead. \n\n(This was a joke. But I do think you\u2019re valid if you want to go low contact after this. If you don\u2019t want to \u201cdestroy\u201d her, I\u2019d say just give her the presents, make it through the holidays, and then reduce contact. Don\u2019t reach out, but if she reaches out don\u2019t necessarily ignore her completely - that might cause more emotional blowback - just make excuses to keep her at arm\u2019s length. You gotta protect your own mental health.

Going LC after this seems reasonable but returning her gifts is the nuclear option.", "NTA unless you are childish shouldn't return the presents out of spite because you can't grow up & provide constructive non passive aggressive feedback around your mom's erratic behavior.\n\nGive the gift you intended to give but tell your mom. At a separate time explain you're not going to put up with her emotional and verbal abuse in the future and have clear boundaries and exit plan for future events.\n\nActing with low EQ in return only devolves the situation. Lift yourself up and be more mature even if your mom struggles with emotional regulation. She sounds like she needs therapy.", "INFO:  Do you have to stay with them?

And it's not an accinent that it happened after a break of you being away and out of the familiar 'familial soup', lol.\n\nWhen I moved out I was almost continuously away from mom for several years. During which I guess I idealistically concluded that we didn't have a relationship much before, so now we get to re-build one as adults. And as I started probing some seemingly benign, if vulnerable topics, she would shut down or explode and I couldn't figure out WTF went wrong in that conversation.\n\nMy mom was never an emotionally mature adult and that's why we never had those conversations before. I just saw it with adult eyes from the sidelines and not from a perspective where she controlled every minutia and every family member around her to keep her psyche safe.\n\nLet me know  in a few years if any of that seems familiar :)", "NTA I can't imagine yelling at my child for wanting a glass of juice, much less hoarding the juice to be used within a specific time frame only.

When you're out of her house, you can chose what kind of relationship you want with her.", "While I understand both sides, I don't understand why she blew up about this. My kids push and push (eldest is 8) so I just calmly say either no or in a minute. When they push too much is when I have to put my foot down but j certainly don't shout at them and call them selfish. I say no again and tell them to stop crying over it, I'd probably offer them an alternative.", "Adults communicate with their words. If you go no contact you should be able to put your feelings into words, then communicate them before going NC.

NTA if you're able to do that", "I am not saying that your mother's behaviour is acceptable, but think carefully about your financial position before going NC. For example, how is your student accommodation being funded?", "I'm going to need more information before I make a judgment. For example who pays for your school? Do you contribute any money towards the household? Who's doing the majority of the planning shopping cooking and cleaning for christmas? Is it reasonable to say that your mother is very stressed out because she is one of the main contributors to the planning shopping cooking and cleaning for Christmas and Christmas is in a few days? Is it a reasonable assumption that you're stressed out mother would shout at you because she is stressed out and you kept on harping on something and probably did something in a 19 year old would do like roll your eyes or act huffy? Have you volunteered to help out in any Christmas planning shopping decorating or cleaning? Is you throwing a tantrum over a cup of orange juice worth completely disinheriting your mother and returning her Christmas gifts and not forgiving her? LMAO", "ESH.  You know that groceries are pretty much all for Christmas?   Your mother overreacted, but if you knew it was xmas food/drink, just move on.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWanting NC or LC but not doing it because \"it would destroy her\" is also a very wishy washy perspective.

I do recommend, after the holidays, that you start limiting contact with your mother. This does not have to be the first step towards estrangement! For many people, limiting contact is the way they can stay in touch with difficult family members.

Good luck", "I can understand that and OP having a fresh perspective on it.  It's the \"home from university.\"  I don't know who's paying for/supporting university costs, but as long as Mom's address is still considered home, I'd hold off on escalating things.

Assigning these behaviours to a mental illness she does not have, in my opinion, is essentially scapegoating, and furthering stereotypes and misconceptions about people with NPD and BPD. It makes life harder for a community of people which have nothing to do with my mother. \n\nBPD and NPD are not the only mental illnesses that can affect how a person may act. My issue with these subs, in my opinion, is that it\u2019s essentially a hate group of people assigning bad behaviours to a mental illness they don\u2019t like, usually (from what I\u2019ve seen, the parents are undiagnosed and being labelled by people not qualified to do so). Where as in reality this behaviour could be caused by no mental illness, and just a bad person, or by any other illness, yet the people who are innocent and diagnosed get affected by these perceptions.", "I think your explanation for why you do not support those subs is perfectly clear and respectful. I am sorry that some are labeling your comments as enabling.", "op, i completely agree with everything you've said. i'm sorry that you're being called an enabler just for refusing to contribute to damaging stigma.\n\nyour mother sounds emotionally abusive, and i'd definitely recommend seeing a trauma informed therapist if you're able to.", "Your criticisms are at least somewhat valid since that does go on there (in RBN, anyway, I\u2019m not familiar with the other), but it\u2019s worth noting that the things you\u2019re describing, \u201cdrive by diagnosis\u201d etc. are violations of the sub\u2019s rules, not what the sub is designed for! \n\n It\u2019s like someone saying they don\u2019t support AITA because of all the shitposting. Yeah, kinda accurate, but not an indication of what the sub is actually supposed to be about.\n\nThings get thru that I personally wish weren\u2019t there, but it seems like the mods are truly doing their best.  \u201cHate group\u201d is a pretty extreme label and not appreciated."]}
