Don\u2019t reach out, but if she reaches out don\u2019t necessarily ignore her completely - that might cause more emotional blowback - just make excuses to keep her at arm\u2019s length.

At a separate time explain you're not going to put up with her emotional and verbal abuse in the future and have clear boundaries and exit plan for future events.\n\nActing with low EQ in return only devolves the situation.

During which I guess I idealistically concluded that we didn't have a relationship much before, so now we get to re-build one as adults. And as I started probing some seemingly benign, if vulnerable topics, she would shut down or explode and I couldn't figure out WTF went wrong in that conversation.\n\nMy mom was never an emotionally mature adult and that's why we never had those conversations before.

Assigning these behaviours to a mental illness she does not have, in my opinion, is essentially scapegoating, and furthering stereotypes and misconceptions about people with NPD and BPD. It makes life harder for a community of people which have nothing to do with my mother. \n\nBPD and NPD are not the only mental illnesses that can affect how a person may act. My issue with these subs, in my opinion, is that it\u2019s essentially a hate group of people assigning bad behaviours to a mental illness they don\u2019t like, usually (from what I\u2019ve seen, the parents are undiagnosed and being labelled by people not qualified to do so).

If you say, \"I cannot allow you to speak to me that way unprovoked, so I'm going to walk away,\" will she stop or will she go even more ballistic?
