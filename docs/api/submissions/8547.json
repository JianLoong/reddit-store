Good for you for looking out for your health.

You do your thing while she does hers. There's nothing wrong with following two separate paths in a relationship as long as you're supporting each other.", "NAH. I think part of the issue is the way you talk about food. It seems like you categorize things as either healthy or unhealthy, and that most things the average person eats are unhealthy by your standards. You also talk about certain foods or meals being bad. Even if your intention isn't to judge your girlfriend, a lot of the language you use around food is very judgemental. Your girlfriend has probably heard you talking about food she likes and eats as \"bad\" and \"unhealthy\" and feels understandably judged, because by saying that food \"bad\" and \"unhealthy\" you are implying that she is in the wrong for consuming those things.\n\nOther folks have mentioned speaking with a dietitian, which I think is a really good idea, but I would also recommend speaking with a therapist who specializes in eating disorders. Limiting food types/amounts and working out heavily can very quickly turn into an eating disorder without you realizing it. By having a therapist who knows what to look for with regards to eating disorders you can ensure that you're doing things in a way that is good for your mind along with your body.\n\nLastly, I just want to say that it sounds like your girlfriend follows an intuitive eating approach, which is likely why her weight stays so stable. I'd recommend looking into the concept of intuitive eating to get a different perspective on what eating healthy can be, even if you don't decide to implement it for yourself.", "NTA, she who doesn't like a guy who counts calories should not date a bodybuilder.

I am fairly convinced that if a nutritionist told my guy that his system is off, he'd still do it, so I hope you'll see the nutritionist before it becomes a compulsive thing you can't get in control of. \n2. My guy almost gave me an eating disorder -- not because he said or did anything in particular, but because if I was making dinner for the two of us, I started to judge food the way he did, and I didn't have a concept of good and bad food, just healthy and junk. So, I would think I did pretty good with salad and chicken... and it'd be wrong. He wouldn't say anything, but I'd see it as he'd enter it into the app. Also, my dude has a pretty interesting take about carbs and salad and bread are both bad?! That's stressful to live with. As a side note, more fiber is important and your body needs roughage. \nI'm not saying your girlfriend went about the conversation well, but I can understand where she's coming from. You guys just aren't food compatible. So, it's going to take breaking up or good communication to fix.", "Again, NTA. Questions only you can answer for yourself: Are you looking for a long-term relationship or is this short term? Why don't you partake in Indian food you cook for her? Seems like lentils/rice are 2 of the main ingredients of your diet.\n\nI'm not trying to bust your chops. But, food/dining is such a shared, 3 times/day or more thing, if you don't envision this as someone you want to be with long term, it may be time to go your separate ways. You can remain friends.\n\nThink of it this way: 1 person is a staunch vegan. The other person believes in the Keto diet of high meat consumption, low carbs.

I view eating in terms of goals\u2014 protein is necessary to grow muscle, and the body just flushes out extra protein beyond what it needs with no harm done so I eat a lot of protein, always. Beyond that, when I want to lose fat I restrict calories and when I want to increase mass I increase calories. Pretty standard bodybuilding stuff. If food is offered to me that\u2019s unhealthy, I eat it in moderation\u2014 like two/three slices of pizza when I\u2019m out with my friends.

If she\u2019s picturing a lifetime with you, she may be picturing a not-unlikely future time where her body no longer meets your standards of health, and she doesn\u2019t like the idea that this would make you think you have the right to measure and judge her diet the way you do your own.", "My husband has a similar diet and although he hasNEVER made a comment about my diet i sometimes feel badly about myself because of it. Sometimes I feel like he is so dedicated, i could really put in some extra effort to eat better or exercise more. My point is, i think this is an internal thing for her and instead of confronting her insecurities shes asking you to change. Id have a DELICATE conversation with her. nta", ">Hmm, this is not a good sign, and I think it\u2019s a clue to her issues with you on this topic. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s unintentional on your part, but it comes off as a threat that if something happens to her health you will be ready to swoop in and harass her about her food choices.\n\nNo, that's a good sign. Who on earth would want a partner that doesn't say anything out of concern for you about a change in your eating habita that causes you to deal with health issues? You really want a partner who's going to watch you self-destruct and harm yourself and not bring it up even once? Like, yeah, no one wants to be *harrassed* about it, but having a conversation is perfectly okay. \n\n>There are a multitude of health problems that people can encounter that are neither caused nor cured by food, and even the ones that are food-related will be HERS to manage.\n\nThat doesn't mean OP can't bring it up with her and find out what the root of the issue is, or if there's anything he can do to support her. Think about it this way: if you noticed your partner start to take up drinking more often to the point that it became a problem, would you not say anything bc it's their issue to manage? Even if it means the issue may get worse and start affecting your relationship?", "Saying something neutral and helpful, bringing it up appropriately? Sure! But the way OP talks about his hyper-scrutiny of his own diet, I can understand his girlfriend fearing that level of hyper-scrutiny aimed at her in a time when she would already be dealing with direct effects of health problems.", "Nutritionists are not trained for what works with body building.  Most are into the standard food pyramid, which doesn't work for everyone.  I would consult with one who is well-known in the body building world.  Be wary of those who make their living off of selling supplements.", "They eat out with people and will have whatever. Then watch what they eat the other times. Not unhealthy, just unusual these days. Unless you're older like me, I'm in my 40s, go to the gym four times a week and watch what I eat to stay in shape. \n\nIt takes huge effort to get back in shape at my age and maintaining it is far easier. I look at it like checking I have all the right fluids in my car so it keeps working as it should. Except with my body, any excess turns to fat gain and I have a healthy amount of fat, but am in a good weight range.\n\nOP mentions it took a long time to get to where they are and want to maintain it. Blokes I train with are pretty dedicated to looking good and some obsessively do bulk and cuts. I don't, I just maintain as I'm happy with how I look.", "NTA but this is an eating disorder and maybe she\u2019s a little concerned about that too", "Yta you are restricted to such an extent it would qualify as an eating disorder", "NAH. But I do feel for your girlfriend. Your diet is really quite extreme. Food is such a fun, communal bonding experience. I\u2019m not sure I could date someone long term who has such rigid requirements and restrictions around food, especially self imposed ones (not allergies). Even if you do \u201cbreak\u201d them sometimes for her she probably just feels guilty for making you and knowing that you don\u2019t want to or like the food. \n\nYou\u2019re young and you should enjoy your body and good health while it lasts. However maybe you should also think about the long term. Will you be trying to maintain 10% body fat in your 30s? What about your 40s when you have kids? I\u2019m not saying you should give it all up right now for her, but just some food for thought (sorry). Maybe she would be reassured if you had an end date for this level of extreme eating in mind.\n\nEdit: changed judgement to NAH, don\u2019t think the gf is the A so it\u2019s not NTA", "NTA for not judging your gf. However you have an eating disorder. The obsession you have over maintaining such a low body fat percentage is not good for long term health. It\u2019s bad for your brain and overall body function. Occasionally that low isn\u2019t bad, but maintaining that means you\u2019re constantly denying yourself proper nutrition unless under strict guidelines from a doctor and nutritionist", "NTA - her insecurities are not your problem. Sounds like you work very hard, good for you if it makes you happy.", "Honestly your girlfriend sounds emotionally manipulative. Unless she\u2019s actually blind, she could probably SEE what a nice body you have, which was also part of her attraction to you. \nOf course men with nice bodies have to not only work out like crazy, but eat ridiculously clean. \nSo why is she now trying to throw you off your horse?\nIt\u2019s like dating a religious leader and then trying to seed doubts of aetheistic \u201cthere is no god\u201d thoughts into his head. \n\nThis is all very strange. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this.", "NTA keeping yourself in shape is important.", ">The fact I measure my food intake so much bothers my girlfriend, since she approaches eating a lot more casually\u2014 she eats what she wants when she wants it. She feels I judge her for eating whatever, which I don\u2019t.  \n>  \n>Because of this fear, she asked me to change my diet and eat more like she does\n\nNTA.\n\nLook, I'm sure you've had your fill of irrelevant assholes who've probably lectured you about your passion. You do you, and you live your best life. It isn't for everyone, but it's what you want, and so long as you're otherwise healthy, not starving yourself, dehydrating yourself, or depriving yourself what your body needs for a look than what others think is irrelevant.\n\nHowever, and this is the meat of my point, **your girlfriend has zero fucking right to request this.** Her insecurities will always be something she has to manage herself, and it is unhealthy for her to externalize the responsibility of their management onto you.\n\n>She\u2019s upset I won\u2019t eat more like her and stop counting calories. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair.\n\nBecause it isn't. You're eighteen and young, so I understand things like boundaries and understanding how to manage relationships is still coming to you even at the dawn of adulthood, but you have every right to manage your diet however you see fit regardless of whether she likes it or not. It is on her to live with this, not on you to acquiesce her demands.", "NTA - It\u2019s pretty common for people to react to guilt with defensiveness. So it sounds to me like she feels guilty about her diet and instead of changing it, would rather you join her in bad eating habits. If she is really that insecure to ask you to change your purposeful eating habits just to make her feel better then I bet she is also somewhat superficial and would dump you in a heartbeat if you ended up gaining weight/losing your figure due to the change in eating. \n\nAlternative perspective****\nUnless of course you are actually displaying signs of disordered eating and she is picking up on that and attempting to help through a less confrontational approach\u2026could be something to consider as well.", "OP says nothing about doing this to be attractive.", "by the definition I don\u2019t think if qualifies as one", "calorie counting is an important and necessary part of bodybuilding", "I guess I\u2019ve never been somebody that enjoyed food that much but more just saw it as a means to an end. And 10% body fat *is* maintainable for a long time, although of course it will get harder as time goes on.\n\nI do see the perspective thag some people have strong feelings of love attached to food and sharing it.", "10% is healthy to maintain. Below 8% is when it gets bad", "What you\u2019re doing is NOT healthy. \nI\u2019m deeply familiar with bodybuilding but cutting 365 days a year is disordered.", "But his poops must be weird", "Ooooof! Ding ding red flag \ud83d\udea9", "It does. Being obsessive about input and output seeing food as math. That is an eating disorder. Not the worst thing you could be doing but still not a healthy relationship with food.", "Will you still love her and find her attractive if she stops being slim and fit? You sound like you would freak out over a 15 lb weight gain, which can happen to her as she gets older, if she ever has a longer illness, etc. Or being a freshman, lol! If you're communicating that to her even unintentionally, it will make her anxious about food. And you.\n\nI probably don't need to tell you this, but: there are lots of people who are 40 lbs overweight who eat well and exercise daily and are much healthier than normal weight, sedentary people who eat processed food all day. You really need to get over the mental construct of weight equating to health.", "That doesn't make it not disordered! When a whole culture is disordered the disorder seems normal but it's still disorder.", "Maybe it\u2019s just a personality difference between you two. Do you ever cook together? Do you eat the same meal as a shared experience? I don\u2019t meant going out with friends but with just her. Do you ever cook for her? Something that she likes?\n\nI didn\u2019t enjoy cooking much when I was single, but I did appreciate good food. My husband is an excellent cook, he grew up in a restaurant and knows his stuff. I can still remember the taste of the first meal he ever made me. It\u2019s a core memory for me, that\u2019s how good it was. I could tell he was trying to show off and it worked! Over the years we have so many memories of being together in the kitchen, experimenting with different techniques, trying to recreate something we had in a restaurant, honing our dishes so we can host for holidays and make other people happy. It\u2019s an important part of our dynamic.\n\nI understand that for you that isn\u2019t very important, but I\u2019d hazard a guess it\u2019s important to more people than you think and it sounds like it\u2019s important to your girlfriend. Maybe you guys just aren\u2019t compatible\u2026? I hate to be a downer but I can tell you that with your dietary restrictions you wouldn\u2019t be someone I could date for long, no matter how fit you are.\n\nAlso, not sure if you want to have kids but I can promise you this diet won\u2019t fly if you do. Your kids will not understand why daddy gets to have his own special plate of plain chicken and rice while they have to eat broccoli.\n\nJust some things to think about!", "I\u2019m not cutting 365 days a year.", "Wanting your loved ones to be healthy isn\u2019t a red flag", "not really. you need a certain amount of each nutrient group to be healthy. not doing that is less heathy than making sure you get good amounts of protein, fat, and carbs and not overdoing one", "That\u2019s an incorrect statement.

Don\u2019t take my word for it. Ask a therapist.", "I'm a doctor, so don't try to explain what's healthy to me. When you look at metabolic markers of health, brain health, etc, what I said stands: within a surprisingly large range, exercise and diet matter more than weight. I understand that goes against what our highly fatphobic culture tells people, but it's true. Sedentary normal weight people who eat a lot of processed foods can be extremely unhealthy, while an overweight exerciser who eats a Mediterranean diet can be very healthy.", "Diet research is mostly garbage. People vary vastly in what diet is healthy for them. What is never healthy is obsessing about food.", "in far larger qualities yeah. clean bulking.", "Then that would be on her for making assumptions about her boyfriend's behavior instead of having a conversation with him about it. He clearly hasn't said anything about her diet to her yet, since she admitted she's afraid he judges her for it instead of feeling bad that he makes comments or whatever. So at the very least, from her perspective, even if he judges her, he's doing so silently, for who knows how long since they've been dating. \n\nThey're still pretty young (or at least I'm hoping she's around OP's age lol), so it's understandable that she doesn't know the mature way to address issues she has in a relationship, but that doesn't make it okay to project her insecurities onto her bf. I think it's kind of rude of her to tell him she thinks he judges her if he's never expressed that sentiment to her-it's kind of insulting to be told by your partmer that they think you capable of something unkind if you've never indicated that in your actions/behavior.
