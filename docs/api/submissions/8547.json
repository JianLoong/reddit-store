I do think it's wise to eat healthy in general and counting may be part of that if that is relevant to your goals. Some people actually into fitness or nutrition don't count and might have other ways to manage portions/macros. Do note that counting can have negative effects for some people and lead to unhealthy eating habits, ironically.\n\nI don't think the GF request is reasonable. It sounds like she just feels a bit bad or self conscious about her own eating habits. It doesn't seem like you make comments or intentionally make her feel bad though. People are weird about food to the point of getting insulted if you eat differently. That's on others though.\n\nYou might try talking more about what bothers her.

Kudos to you for having such discipline and clearly defined goals at such a young age! \n\nShe should be supportive of your goals and not try to derail them. It sounds like she's insecure in the relationship and thinks you'll leave her for someone prettier/who eats healthier/is what she perceives as all the things she isn't.\n\nThis is a her problem, not a you problem. \n\nYou say you started this regimen 3 years ago but you don't say when you started dating. I'm assuming it was after and if so, she knew this about you and decided to have a relationship anyway.\n\nEither way, you're both young. You're both still trying to figure out who you are. Both of your goals will change as you get older and while you enjoy the same things now, there's a good chance this relationship isn't forever. Especially if she's expecting you to change because she wants you to, not because you want to.\n\nThe 2 of you could attend a few couples counseling sessions to help you understand why she thinks you judge her and help her understand why this is so important to you.\n\nGood luck.\n\nBased on current info NTA", "NTA; her feeling judged is her own personal problem and asking you to stop something you're passionate about is messed up.", "NTA. Good for you for looking out for your health. You do tend to lose a taste for certain foods if you don't eat them in a while, so it makes sense that a lot of less-healthy stuff doesn't taste good anymore and is less tempting.", "NTA, mate, keep on keeping on. You do your thing while she does hers. There's nothing wrong with following two separate paths in a relationship as long as you're supporting each other.", "NAH. I think part of the issue is the way you talk about food. It seems like you categorize things as either healthy or unhealthy, and that most things the average person eats are unhealthy by your standards. You also talk about certain foods or meals being bad. Even if your intention isn't to judge your girlfriend, a lot of the language you use around food is very judgemental. Your girlfriend has probably heard you talking about food she likes and eats as \"bad\" and \"unhealthy\" and feels understandably judged, because by saying that food \"bad\" and \"unhealthy\" you are implying that she is in the wrong for consuming those things.\n\nOther folks have mentioned speaking with a dietitian, which I think is a really good idea, but I would also recommend speaking with a therapist who specializes in eating disorders. Limiting food types/amounts and working out heavily can very quickly turn into an eating disorder without you realizing it. By having a therapist who knows what to look for with regards to eating disorders you can ensure that you're doing things in a way that is good for your mind along with your body.\n\nLastly, I just want to say that it sounds like your girlfriend follows an intuitive eating approach, which is likely why her weight stays so stable. I'd recommend looking into the concept of intuitive eating to get a different perspective on what eating healthy can be, even if you don't decide to implement it for yourself.", "NTA, she who doesn't like a guy who counts calories should not date a bodybuilder.

That has been okayed by my doctor, yes.", "We share quite a lot of common interests\u2014 studying the same major, both interested in philosophy, politics, psychedelics, and raving.

I am fairly convinced that if a nutritionist told my guy that his system is off, he'd still do it, so I hope you'll see the nutritionist before it becomes a compulsive thing you can't get in control of. \n2. My guy almost gave me an eating disorder -- not because he said or did anything in particular, but because if I was making dinner for the two of us, I started to judge food the way he did, and I didn't have a concept of good and bad food, just healthy and junk. So, I would think I did pretty good with salad and chicken... and it'd be wrong. He wouldn't say anything, but I'd see it as he'd enter it into the app. Also, my dude has a pretty interesting take about carbs and salad and bread are both bad?! That's stressful to live with. As a side note, more fiber is important and your body needs roughage. \nI'm not saying your girlfriend went about the conversation well, but I can understand where she's coming from. You guys just aren't food compatible. So, it's going to take breaking up or good communication to fix.", "Again, NTA. Questions only you can answer for yourself: Are you looking for a long-term relationship or is this short term? Why don't you partake in Indian food you cook for her? Seems like lentils/rice are 2 of the main ingredients of your diet.\n\nI'm not trying to bust your chops. But, food/dining is such a shared, 3 times/day or more thing, if you don't envision this as someone you want to be with long term, it may be time to go your separate ways. You can remain friends.\n\nThink of it this way: 1 person is a staunch vegan. The other person believes in the Keto diet of high meat consumption, low carbs. Are those 2 people mutually compatible long term? Especially when their goals are different.\n\nI'm not trying to tell you what to do! I'm just trying to point out things you should think about. I wish you the very best.", "Yes. \n\nIf OP changes his diet, he will no longer have a body builder\u2019s physique.

On my phone!!", "Or she doesn\u2019t want him to have an eating disorder? Lol", "> What are you doing? \n\nWhat it\u2019s recommended to build muscle/lessen body fat? I understand this can lead to more toxic cycles regarding eating disorders or whatnot, but calorie counting itself is a tool that tells you how much to eat in to gain, loss, or maintain weight.

NTA, but I think it's worth discussing with her ways to make her more comfortable, in case she is feeling a bit judged without you meaning to.

How often do you talk about food or your diet? Do you have any friends you regularly hang out with that doesn't fit your \"healthy living\" criteria? Do they say anything?

You have a limited amount of food you eat, you watch calories closely, you are very aware of your body image, and it is impacting your relationship with others.

It\u2019s always been something I\u2019ve been indifferent to, and while I did use to eat a decent amount of junk food, I don\u2019t really miss it that much. I view eating in terms of goals\u2014 protein is necessary to grow muscle, and the body just flushes out extra protein beyond what it needs with no harm done so I eat a lot of protein, always. Beyond that, when I want to lose fat I restrict calories and when I want to increase mass I increase calories. Pretty standard bodybuilding stuff. If food is offered to me that\u2019s unhealthy, I eat it in moderation\u2014 like two/three slices of pizza when I\u2019m out with my friends. Some of my friends count calories like I do, some eat whatever, it doesn\u2019t really matter.", "You are still doing it. Your goals, calories, your body and self-defense.\n\n\nMaybe it would help if you read about our coping mechanisms to deal with past traumas. Visit a nutritionist,   start seeing a therapist. \n\n\nJust take your post to a therapist and say your chosen diet became an obstacle maintaining a healthy relationship. I am no expert but I bet my bottom dollar that your post tells so much about your beliefs and behaviors. Body issues, communication failure with others, obsessive rituals, misguided beliefs about nutrition, projecting. \n\n\nI don't know how old you are, but I am guessing you are young. So I'll just say we've all been there. We a struggle with weight, eating right, our size. But don't let it rule your life and ruin your relationships.", "In the case of maintaining a relationship, I see that as less the fault of my eating habits and more of the other person\u2019s ability to maintain healthy boundaries that aren\u2019t controlling. \n\nAs for the rest of the post, of course this could be construed as a coping mechanism or defensiveness, but I do honestly not see tailoring meals towards body goals as alarming as you do because it\u2019s a foundational building block of getting more muscles (by eating more) and by getting abs and such (by eating less). So I\u2019m wondering what exactly about it is so alarming I guess", "I  am not saying she is right. But is that what she's really saying? \n\nYes, healthy boundaries, we can all use some. The fact that I am sitting here, worrying about someone I don't even know instead of enjoying a beautiful day show that I don't have it.\n\n\nAs a middle aged person I have witnessed more than a few people who battled similar issues. Some developed permanent health issues, lost good partners or raised their children in the gym daycare. There was one who managed to balance it all but their children now have eating disorders. You have all the legitimate resources available to you. Please take care of yourself \"fellow youth.\" I am out."]}
