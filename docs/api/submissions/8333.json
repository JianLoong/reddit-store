Not yours. Sounds like you already went above and beyond to try and help them, but you are in no way obligated to do so and they should be very grateful you helped at all. You have your own life.", "NTA. Your ex and her other son need to step up and figure out a way to help their mom. You've done enough, and it's really not your responsibility. It's understandable that you would snap when you've been doing so much and have your own responsibilities (job, children).", "NTA her family needs to help her. It's not your responsibility", "NTA.

They\u2019re in a tough position, but they\u2019re leaving all or most of the research and emotional labor around this to you. They\u2019re the ones who will be out of a house soon, too, so they should be using all their energy to find a solution, EVEN if you were looking, too. \n\nYou definitely don\u2019t need to be their saviors (and eventual scapegoat), if they\u2019re not even trying.", "NTA there\u2019s only so much that can be done. If they truly aren\u2019t helping themselves, you can\u2019t do all the heavy lifting for them. Should you have snapped? No, but it seems to be a symptom of the pressure this has put on you. \n\nI would apologize for snapping, and only help in ways you can without over extending yourself. At the end of the day, this is their crisis. You\u2019re only human, and have your own life to live.", "Obviously NTA\n\nYou cannot reason or control obsessive addictive behavior in others", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm amazed you continued helping as long as you did when she has her own children to help her (but who clearly cannot be bothered to do so). She's their mother, she's their problem.", "NTA. You've already gone above and beyond for her. It's ok to say you can't do anymore and not feel guilty about it", "NTA.  You've done all you can and then some.

You've  done enough.", "NTA.", "Definitely NTA it\u2019s wonderful that you\u2019ve helped her as much as you have but it shouldn\u2019t be your responsibility! You\u2019ve got enough of your plate with your own life and children. At some point she needs to step up and be responsible for herself. You\u2019re definitely not in the wrong here, let them figure it out.", "NTA\n\nThere are numerous adult living with her who could've taken care of this situation but decided to let you because they weren't worried about it. You can wash your hands of it and let them care for her. Its their mother.", "NTA\n\nAt some point you're being a crutch to their poor behavior and it's quite obvious to the uninvolved that she's taken advantage of your empathy. You owe it to yourself to rid of her toxicity.", "NTA.  You have no obligation to any of these people.  You must put yourself and your children first.  Go no contact.  Save yourself mentally and financially.  Her children are the ones responsible for her.", "NTA. You've done enough, and you have your job and kids to take care of. Enough is enough.", "Dude. NTA. It\u2019s not even your mother. Not your responsibility. You have done WAY MORE than you need to put of the kindness of your heart. \n\nThe landlord couldn\u2019t have sprung this last minute on them. They just expected someone to solve their problems magically. There\u2019s what, 4 adults in that household? Why can\u2019t they solve their own problems and why do you have to be her driver when you live so far away? \n\nSet boundaries! I\u2019m glad you blew up!", "NTA. You've done all of the hand-holding you could possibly do, and none of that was your responsibility to begin with.
