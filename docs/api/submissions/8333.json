Not yours. Sounds like you already went above and beyond to try and help them, but you are in no way obligated to do so and they should be very grateful you helped at all. You have your own life.", "NTA. Your ex and her other son need to step up and figure out a way to help their mom. You've done enough, and it's really not your responsibility. It's understandable that you would snap when you've been doing so much and have your own responsibilities (job, children).", "NTA her family needs to help her. It's not your responsibility", "NTA. They are adults, it's their responsibility. You have your own adulting to do.", "NTA. It sounds like you\u2019re right. They\u2019re in a tough position, but they\u2019re leaving all or most of the research and emotional labor around this to you. They\u2019re the ones who will be out of a house soon, too, so they should be using all their energy to find a solution, EVEN if you were looking, too. \n\nYou definitely don\u2019t need to be their saviors (and eventual scapegoat), if they\u2019re not even trying.", "NTA there\u2019s only so much that can be done. If they truly aren\u2019t helping themselves, you can\u2019t do all the heavy lifting for them. Should you have snapped? No, but it seems to be a symptom of the pressure this has put on you. \n\nI would apologize for snapping, and only help in ways you can without over extending yourself. At the end of the day, this is their crisis. You\u2019re only human, and have your own life to live.", "Obviously NTA\n\nYou cannot reason or control obsessive addictive behavior in others", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm amazed you continued helping as long as you did when she has her own children to help her (but who clearly cannot be bothered to do so). She's their mother, she's their problem.", "NTA. You've already gone above and beyond for her. It's ok to say you can't do anymore and not feel guilty about it", "NTA.  You've done all you can and then some.  Walk away.", "NTA\n\nYou've bent over backwards for her, more than your ex or her other family.  You've  done enough.", "NTA.", "Definitely NTA it\u2019s wonderful that you\u2019ve helped her as much as you have but it shouldn\u2019t be your responsibility! You\u2019ve got enough of your plate with your own life and children. At some point she needs to step up and be responsible for herself. You\u2019re definitely not in the wrong here, let them figure it out.", "NTA\n\nThere are numerous adult living with her who could've taken care of this situation but decided to let you because they weren't worried about it. You can wash your hands of it and let them care for her. Its their mother.", "NTA\n\nAt some point you're being a crutch to their poor behavior and it's quite obvious to the uninvolved that she's taken advantage of your empathy. You owe it to yourself to rid of her toxicity.", "NTA.  You have no obligation to any of these people.  You must put yourself and your children first.  Go no contact.  Save yourself mentally and financially.  Her children are the ones responsible for her.", "NTA. You've done enough, and you have your job and kids to take care of. Enough is enough.", "Dude. NTA. It\u2019s not even your mother. Not your responsibility. You have done WAY MORE than you need to put of the kindness of your heart. \n\nThe landlord couldn\u2019t have sprung this last minute on them. They just expected someone to solve their problems magically. There\u2019s what, 4 adults in that household? Why can\u2019t they solve their own problems and why do you have to be her driver when you live so far away? \n\nSet boundaries! I\u2019m glad you blew up!", "NTA. You've done all of the hand-holding you could possibly do, and none of that was your responsibility to begin with. I hope she respects your decision graciously and doesn't sour the memory of all that you've done for her.", "More info: is this your children's grandparent?", "NTA\n\nAnd you gave being nice your best shot. That's honestly anyone reasonable person can ask from anyone else.\n\nConsider your hands washed clean with good reason.", "NTA. You have already done a lot. And probably spent a lot of time unavailable to YOUR family to do it!\n\nSometimes you just have to say no more, I have to get back to my life, my responsibilities.", "NTA.  Not your responsibility, not your job and not even your family anymore", "NTA\n\nShe is not your problem.", "NTA. She can also do something for herself. Time to set some boundaries.", "NTA. It sounds like they are taking advantage of your goodwill, as well as causing a lot of their own problems. Keep healthy boundaries and don't burn yourself out.", "NTA. But you need to STOP. You are no longer connected to the family. Stop using your precious time to take care of other people's problems. Have some peace in your life.", "NTA You've done your best, now it's time to protect your energy.", "Hands? I\u2019d be washing my whole body of her if I were you.\nNTA", "She is.  Which is the only reason I\u2019ve gone above and beyond for her.", "NTA - There's only so far you can go.   When you had the mental bandwidth to help you helped.   No you don't, so don't.   It fine", "NTA. You\u2019ve done way more for them than their own kids. \n\nIf you can, put all the paperwork into a folder, make a copy and give it to them to take over.", "Wow! NTA! You've gone above and beyond and done way more than I'd be willing to do. Washing your hands is the right thing to do.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve done enough. Their situation is very sad, but you can\u2019t keep draining yourself and shortchanging your own family, especially your kids. Everyone involved here is an adult.\n\nNot being able to sustain unlimited generosity isn\u2019t being an asshole.", "These are people unwilling to help themselves. What possesses you to do anything at all? NTA and get on with your life as you should have as soon as the divorce was finalized from the sound of things.", "NTA and OP, you are doing too much. People that refuse to help themselves despite everything you have done is too emotionally taxing. I have been there with family staying with us multiple times and getting nothing but stress and disrespect back. \n\nStop jumping in to help them out. Do not let them in your home and stay. They are not your responsibility. You have your own life to live. \n\nGood luck and create strong boundaries. I believe in you.", ">former MIL\n\nAnnnnnnnnd hands washed right there. NTA.", "NTA. You were kindly helping but the burden had become too much to for you. You need to make sure you and your kids are looked after first. If they don't understand that then they are TAs.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is your EX and his family."]}
