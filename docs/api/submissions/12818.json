Your parents and his family really need to understand the seriousness of the situation that prompted you to fake being engaged in order to get this guy off your back\u2026", "Wait so someone makes you feel uncomfortable for years and all your family cares about is how you ruined the event?  Why haven\u2019t they told Lucas to leave you alone?  NTA but your family sure is for not having your back", "nta. How OLD is lucas? 5 years old? Why is he telling everyone you're engaged? what right does he have to do that? Your parents should be upset with him not you. Lucas ruined it not you. Most people you tell off like that would be upset, but would go running and telling everyone in the room.", "NTA, guy sounds like a crybaby and should leave you alone", "NTA. Wtf. Wtf is wrong with your family to be acting this way? How can they not see how desperate and trapped you must\u2019ve been to make up an engagement.

If you can stretch your arms, and he is in close enough proximity to touch, then he is in your personal space. Wear brass knuckles when you do stretch your arms out, and go for the nose. Apparently no one else is going to protect you from this predator. So you need to protect yourself. He sounds somewhat unhinged, and 10 years of this is too much for anyone to deal with.  If you don\u2019t want to hit him, you can still ruin the event. Call the police at every single event that he even speaks to you. If you\u2019re going to get blamed anyway, you may as well get something out of it\u2026like the satisfaction of making his life hell since he doesn\u2019t have a problem doing it to you.\n\nEDIT:  Didn\u2019t realize he was a cop when I wrote this message. Whole heartedly agree with another commenter that stated to get some video surveillance around your house, and record any interaction that you have with him for your own protection at home or in public.

I am having a hard time understanding how what you did \"ruined the event\" in your parents' eyes, while at the same time it would have been okay to simply leave and potentially ruin the event for your brother.

If that\u2019s what finally worked to get him to back off after a decade of being stalked and harassed, keep it up! I sure hope they all realize that you\u2019re brilliant and they need to keep up the facade for your sake.", "What kind of family is this?? Why is it more important to them that Lucas attend family celebrations and events than you? In fact, why are they still in contact with him (and inviting him at all) when he's been harassing you for years? NTA, but I'd take your parents' advice and avoid the whole lot of them until they got their priorities right", "NTA. Your family chose to ruin the event. They know that Lucas harasses you but they believed that you got engaged and only told him? It seems like they just wanted to be upset with you. They could have figured that out themselves.", "NTA - why should YOU leave?? Maybe he needs more than just a wake up call.. his behaviour is bordering if not is obsessive", "NTA. But adopt the approach that you will ruin every event you are harassed at. Make a scene, because they're more worried about appearances than your safety so you have to look out for yourself. He's a cop so I get how your legal options may feel limited.\n\nYou don't have to be polite or keep up some veneer of respectability when your family has basically allowed you to be harassed and intimidated on an ongoing basis. Be as loud, as distracting and as open about being harassed by this man as possible until someone in your family understands that they keep putting you in this position.", "NTA. Anyone who thinks you did wrong is.", "If you have to pretend to be engaged to get someone to stop harassing you and your parents think you're the problem, you need to tell your parents to get a reality check.\n\nNTA.", "No. Nope. You are a victim of this man's inability to accept the word 'no'. Being polite hasn't worked, shouting didn't work, a friends intervention hasn't worked. And so your friends and family have placed the onus on you to 'walk away' and leave fun events because he won't change. Not an acceptable expectation. \n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would tell Lucas and your family that the next time you are made to feel uncomfortable by him, you are either calling security or the police (location dependent) and you are the victim of harassment. Do not accept \"he's harmless\" or \"you should be flattered\" or \"just ignore him, he'll get bored eventually\". Once he is physically removed from a venue or is spoken to by police, he will sulk but he may learn a lesson on unwanted attention. NTA\n\nEdit - just read he's a cop. Threaten to go to the precinct and make a complaint. Not sure it would work (it would where I am) but make a noise and rumpus about it and he may just decide its not worth the hassle.", "NTA this guy wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer, no big deal I don\u2019t know why this has been thrown out of proportion. I use to do that to get left alone", "NTA. Why was Lucas invited to the event at all???   You shouldn't have been 'able to go' because 'he couldn't make it'. He shouldn't have been allowed to go because you had been invited and your needs come first. And WHY did nobody bother to intervene when Lucas showed up after all and immediately started to follow you around??? Ofc other people talking to him and yelling about it hasn't worked. Nobody seems to have established any real boundaries. He needs to be shown that there are consequences to his actions.", "Yep. And OP said in a comment above --the dude's a cop.", "Several people have spoken to him but it doesn\u2019t work.", "Sounds like they were just waiting for a tizzy to start, and you gave them a ring-side seat.", "Tommy and Nick said that Lucas wasn\u2019t coming. And I do believe they meant it. He\u2019s a cop who works weird hours, so they thought he\u2019d have to work that night.

I\u2019m still pissed off for this OP\u2026", "Dear lord. Guess it's time to move... to a new country.   \nThat is legitimately terrifying. I'm actually scared for OP.", "That is incredibly scary. Women actually do move because of a situation like that.", "You shouldn\u2019t have to lie, but it\u2019s time for you to speak out. Make a scene if you have to.\n\n\u201cDude, I told you I\u2019m not interested in dating you or even being your friend. Leave me alone!\u201d And the people around you should back you up.\n\nFully explain to your family why you felt the need to lie, maybe apologize, but also ask for their support to put a full stop the harassment. I would even ask them to stop inviting him if you\u2019re going to be in attendance if none of this works. NEVER isolate yourself at these events. He doesn\u2019t take no for an answer and that can be very dangerous for you if he gets you alone.", "Wait\u2026you\u2019re being harassed by a cop? No wonder they all just \u201ctalk\u201d to him.  Too bad you can\u2019t just on over to his precinct, and see if you can file harassment and stalking charges against one of their employees. They likely won\u2019t do anything to him either. I\u2019m sure that you love your family, but maybe it\u2019s best you take a break from all of them until they decide to stop protecting your predator. Maybe he should no longer be invited if he can\u2019t back off.", "HE\u2019S A COP?!?!? That makes me personally very, very angry because his whole profession is supposed to represent protecting people and he is in fact a stalker\u2026\n\nI completely agree with the below comment.., If his precinct won\u2019t stop him and your families won\u2019t take this seriously, then you may have to make some very difficult decisions in the near future about possibly going LC or NC with your family until it can be make clear to Lucas his attentions are not wanted or welcome and he needs to leave you alone\u2026", "oh this is so fucked up. i'm sorry your family doesn't have your back. them \"talking to him\" isn't shit if he doesn't actually experience consequences.", "I don't even go to functions just due to the inconvenience of not having a proper chair or place to go relax if I so please. I'd legitimately never go to another event. The fact you say other people have tried talking to him?? Is everyone not immediately aware when he arrived and stop him from even attempting to speak to you?  \n\n\nDoes your family have no care for you whatsoever?", "Oh that is even worse. That makes him basically stalker. He knows this behaviour is not ok. Hope op has got pepper spray, taser and a big dog.", "Me too", "Yeah once he became a cop, I more or less gave up on ever pressing criminal charges. But honestly, he hasn\u2019t done anything illegal. Being creepy isn\u2019t illegal.", "THIS. ALL OF THIS.. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "Just as precaution I\u2019d still get some doorbell cameras and such. You never know, and being a cop could give him more confidence to be extra creepy.\n\nI went out with a coworker on one date. One. After I quit one of the people I used to work with casually mentioned how this guy used to sit outside my house. Apparently after one date he started doing this several times a week and I hadn\u2019t noticed. No one mentioned it because they figured I knew and he\u2019d moved on to more actively stalking someone else.", "Harassing you in fact possibly illegal. If he follows you places, or uses resources as a cop to locate you etc.\n\nI would suggest, if it escalates or continues to be a problem\u2026 reaching out to agencies that work with women who are leaving abusive relationships.\nAt the very least? They should be able to point you to resources to get him to stop being a creep.\n\nPossibly including a restraining order, or similar. More importantly, they can drop all kinds of warnings about what happens if you pursue that. Your area might not be that bad. \n\n\n\nIn any case, definitely NTA, and if they keep pressing you on it? Ask them where they were when you needed help.", "Understood. But OP,  just because he technically might not have broken any laws (at the moment) does not make it right or okay. What Lucas is doing is not okay, it\u2019s not right, and it\u2019s clearly hurting you to the point where you felt the need to not only block him, but fake being engaged.\n\nCops are not above any laws so you may want to look into seeing what the stalking laws are in your state and maybe consider consulting legal aid\u2026", "Wow. Scary as hell.   \nThank G nothing bad happened to you and that you were unaware of what this guy was doing but sorry that he just went on to victimize someone else.\n\nVery good suggestion about installing cameras\u2026", "I had to fire a lawn guy because he started driving by my house to \u201ccheck up on me.\u201d He told me this in a very upbeat voice, like he was proud and I should be happy. I found out that he had multiple protective orders from multiple women for DV, including some that mentioned strangulation. \ud83d\ude33", ">\tCops are not above any laws so you may want to look into seeing what the stalking laws are in your state and maybe consider consulting legal aid\u2026\n\nJust be aware that the thin blue line is a shield that protects their own. Taking out a restraining order would be something that could pose backlash. \n\nTechnically, you are correct,  but pragmatically\u2026. Not so much. A local resource for women who are abused will have a decent feel for how things will go-  wrong that a lawyer that specializes in domestic issues. \n\nI\u2019m not saying all cops are bastards- mostly because I haven\u2019t met all cops"]}
