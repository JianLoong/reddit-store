I\u2019ve had a long week at work with multiple deadlines that I had to meet\n2. I\u2019m the chapter President at my non profit and I had to give a presentation to like 80 people midweek \n3. I was just tired from the workout earlier that day.\n\nShe said the trend of me being unreliable in her times of desperate need continues. \nShe brought up another instance in the past where her Lexapro needed a refill, and she didn\u2019t get it filled till the last moment and then she ran out, her pharmacy is close my office, so I offer to pick it up for her and she said yes. \n\nI picked it up and I got home later that night at like 8pm that night and then she calls me asking what the plan is, and I\u2019m like uh what, and then she goes off on how she\u2019s dizzy and sick cause of the withdrawal from lexapro and that she doesn\u2019t want to plan after getting off a 12 hour shift and then kept saying how she wouldn\u2019t have asked me pick it up if she wanted me to give it her and that I\u2019m unreliable again. That escalated into another fight where I brought up miscommunication and she said she can\u2019t rely on me in her times of need.\n\nText me saying that? \u201cPlease drop off my medication if possible\u201d \nhow hard is that? \nI can\u2019t read between lines on a busy workday\n\nIm someone who already beats himself up a lot mentally.(It\u2019s gotten better after 2 years of therapy but still) \nI just cried all night and told her she needs therapy to work on her shit and that I will not be a punching bag for her to project her panic onto. I said I can\u2019t take this every time and that if she doesn\u2019t work on her shit, we may have to part ways. (I really don\u2019t want to, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy for me to have a raging headache the next day cause of all the crying during fights like this?)\n\nShe keeps saying how all she\u2019s doing is expressing her disappointment and that healthy in a relationship and that we don\u2019t have to fight over every instance, but then how do you then deal with being called unreliable and the silent treatment that follows?\n\nAITA\n\nUPDATE: to everyone saying I wasn\u2019t willing to help, I just wasn\u2019t willing to help that night.

That\u2019s not having to read in between the lines that\u2019s just common sense.", "YTA I think if you were honest with yourself you COULD have said yes and been helpful to someone you care about.", "YTA.\n\nIf you go to the post office to wait for that \"World's Best Boyfriend\" award to arrive, you might want to take a camp chair. It's going to be a long wait.", "YTA, I can't even believe you're serious about not helping her. That's your GF man, if you want to keep her, you gotta do shit like this.  What ended up happening, did she struggle and somehow move it herself, or did someone that cares about her more help her??  She's absolutely right, you are unreliable.", "Info.\n\nHonest question. Do you need everything spelt out for you. For example. You need a step by step of what to do otherwise you can't do it.\n\nLike it's obvious that she needed that medication asap, so why didn't you think to drop it off at her place for when she got off work, it's what people do in loving relationships, they help the other, sometimes going out of their way to help.", "Esh - you both can be better at communicating. Youre tired and she\u2019s tired seems like you both need better ways to cope and destress after work. I personally need time to mentally prepare for things that are asked of me and i don\u2019t like to be thrown into \u201ci need this now \u201c situations. But i make that clear to the people in my life and they know how it is. But i am also impulsive sometimes but i know if im gonna do something on a whim i cant expect anyone to do it at that moment. If i do something impulsive, i know i\u2019ll have to find a way to do it myself. \n\nWith the lexapro you couldve both communicated better about what the plan with you picking it up would be. She shouldn\u2019t have waited till last minute but it is really important to take SSRI\u2019s on time. Withdrawals are tough and you could have done your research to know that she shouldn\u2019t go too long with out it. I don\u2019t think You\u2019re the ah for that though because she could\u2019ve been more responsible but again you could have taken it to her the moment you got it. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to lose her communicate with her and tell her your boundaries or how you feel when she expects something so last minute from you. Tell her exactly how you feel and listen to how she feels too and find a middle ground. If you cant meet in the middle wish each other the best and walk away. You should not have to be her punching bag & she also shouldnt feel like she cant rely on you for little things. Communicate !", "YTA hope she can find someone that\u2019s willing to act like they\u2019re in a relationship with her and be there when she needs help. I bet she\u2019s there for you whenever you need it", "YTA. I can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t help your GF move one piece of furniture wasn\u2019t even like an entire apartment or house worth of stuff but one fucking piece of furniture that would taken max 30 minutes and you could have continued on with your night as usual having also done a nice thing for your gf.\n\nAlso seriously crying that much other a fucking argument where your partner has valid points? That is so fucking unhealthy dude I don\u2019t think she is the one who needs to sort out her shit. Couples fights sure it can get heated and emotional at times but no need to let impact to such a overly dramatic degree where you\u2019re getting headaches from crying\u2026.\n\nYou are clearly stuck in a world of your own and can only see things from your perspective and how they impact you and you\u2019re clearly not investing energy to make your partner a priority which tells me you aren\u2019t in a position to be in a relationship at this time. So maybe you should do both of you a favour and follow through* on that threat of parting ways", "YTA not for saying no to help but for taking it personal, you can\u2019t say criticism has a bad effect on you. \n\nWhen people ask for help they expect it, when they don\u2019t get it they get frustrated, that\u2019s life. \n\nIf you couldn\u2019t see that your GF would obvious get mad at you for not sticking you neck for her(in a pay it forward manner) and you can\u2019t handle the obvious consequences that did follow, unfortunately you\u2019re not mentally ready for relationship\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to help you can\u2019t  care for the silent treatment that follows because now seems like helping her would avoid a lot of headache. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t say no but you need to weight in what happens next", "YTA Being there when she has a crisis is part of being her boyfriend.

And if I got a text like that about medication and I couldn\u2019t. I would simply text sorry not able to pick it up for you. Sounds like you are being a tad selfish and not wanting to assist your gf in anyway. YTA sorry. It doesn\u2019t take much to give your gf a hand and you could work on your communication skills", "Your a 29 year old guy.  If you cry every time your woman fights with you ?  Your screwed.  Wait until you get married. Lol you might need a bubble.  Your woman needs you to be a man and help her do stuff.   It\u2019s sorta your job to be there.  Regardless if you had a rough day at the office.  I\u2019m just saying.  Even if your the president of the hair club for men you got man duty\u2019s to do outside of work.   \n\nEven if it\u2019s heavy.  You phone a friend.   Make it fast an efficient.  That\u2019s what friends do.   Call in a favor and figure it out.   Problem solver 101.", "I dunno.  I don\u2019t think you are TA.  I think you two need to communicate better.  For instance, if the dresser didn\u2019t fit in either person\u2019s vehicle, just point that out and say \u201clet\u2019s arrange a time to pick it up with my cousin\u2019s minivan.\u201d  I think you chose instead to communicate to her that you didn\u2019t feel like it.  But it didn\u2019t matter how you felt because either way, you literally could not have done it.  \n\nWith the lexapro, I think simply asking her if she needs it that night would have helped.  But instead you gave her a specific time window for dropping it off to her and decided that you simply would not drop it off after your 8 pm meeting.  You knew she needed that medication.  But you did what you wanted to do instead.  \n\nSo, I think there\u2019s some passive aggressive push and pull going on on your end that you aren\u2019t owning up to or aware of.  And that is a part of why your communication with her is not effective.  I hope that makes sense.", "There are certain infamous influencers that have concluded that this is what our society has come to.

No one wants to tough it through the storm anymore.\n\nYTA", "I would go rather NTA, because these situations were quite easily avoided. Why would one buy something big and heavy before you set up the transportation for it? It is just plain disrespectful for other person's time to make him/her run because of your unwillingness to plan ahead.", "NTA. She made an impulse purchase and she has to deal with it. She could have talked with you before buying it, but she didn't.  Her expectation in this instance is unreasonable. \n\nThis is not \"a time of desperate need.\" She's made a series of poorly planned decisions (moving into a place with inadequate storage and not planning how to deal with that; buying something she can't transport on her own without arranging for delivery or assistance before making the purchase) and she's taking it out on you for not saving her from the consequences of her actions.", "YTA", "*times of desperate need*\n\nHer desperate need could have been avoided by using a tape measure.\n\nINFO\n\nHow often is this one in desperate need? Or is it just when her lexapro is low?\n\nTo me this is a blatant codependant lash out. I would run fast and far. She's a whole entire adult, damn straight she can't depend on someone else in times of her selfimposed desperate need. The sooner she gets that on board the better.", "Hmmm tough call. I alternated quite a bit as I thought about it and read your other comment replies OP.  \n\nOn one hand, with that medicine it sounds like it was pretty clear that she was completely out and you didn't think to ask when she didn't specify when to bring it. I know for me I'd assume a person asking me to pick up a prescription needs it ASAP.  \n\nOn the other hand, her buying a dresser doesn't make you obligated to help her move it. She should have found someone willing to help and THEN bought it. It's not like she was sick and you didn't come by or there was a fire and you told her no. It was a dresser, it can wait 24 hours. If it had been me I would have gone to help, but I also have anxiety and am terrified to say the word no so... Not sure if I'd have done it for her or to avoid saying no.\n\nUltimately I think I've decided on leaning towards NTA.\n\nOverall it sounds like a communication barrier. She doesn't like to give a lot of details, you want to know a lot of them. There's nothing WRONG with this exactly just it leads to misunderstandings and silly fights like this.", "NTA. She bought the dresser, she's a grown-up, she should have figured out a way to get it home rather than automatically assuming someone else will do it for her without her even checking with the person beforehand.", "NTA. She definitely should have thought about how she was going to get the dresser home before she bought it. Being in \u201cpanic\u201d mode and expecting you to come to the rescue is on her. She assumed you would do this without actually consulting you, and then blamed you when it turned out differently. I do think you can probably bridge some of the gaps in communication with her, especially if you know she\u2019s prone to these types of behaviours. But her calling you unreliable is also unhelpful. She made the assumption on your behalf both times that you would do something you never signed up to do, very last minute. Just because you couldn\u2019t be the knight in shining armour in both situations doesn\u2019t mean you deserve to be chewed out. Could you have done better? Yes, especially with the Lexapro incident bc she may not have been able to text from dizziness. But are you an AH bc you didn\u2019t? No.", "NTA", "I\u2019ll go against the grain here and say NTA. Her lack of planning does not constitute an emergency; she puts herself in impossible situations without regarding your mental health, and then ON TOP OF THAT she berates you cause she f up?!?  Would it be nice if you had the time and energy to mend her messes? Yes. But you don\u2019t, she knows it, and you have communicated it as best you can.

She's your girlfriend. 1) it's usually implied if you offer to pick something up for someone, especially medication you know they need, that you'll also drop it off as soon as you can. That's just common decency. \n2) it's a dresser, it's not like you're moving an entire house worth of stuff.

I get a text after, and I was like \u201coh boy\u201d", "Thank you for the detailed explanation! \n\nI love this girl and I do everything in my power to see her smile! \nWhen she sleeps over at my place during the days I work from home (hybrid work schedule), I make it a point to go buy her coffee even before she wakes up (I hate coffee and hate spending on coffee even more) and she notes all these and appreciates me for being a good bf, but in times like these I just don\u2019t what goes on in her head that seems like a light switch\u2026 once it\u2019s turned on it\u2019s like all this just disappears and I\u2019m just the guy that she can\u2019t depend on now?", "I don\u2019t even let her carry a single shopping bag when we are out in the mall or coming back from the grocery store. I don\u2019t even know why she thought that I was just unwilling to help, I was just not up for it that night. That\u2019s all :/", "I understand, I\u2019ve been trying to do all I can to ease that. I\u2019ve said multiple times to just verbalize everything, requests, expectations, event planning etc etc. I\u2019ve always been a proponent of that, but it\u2019s not within my power to control her visceral reaction to something that was requested of me at the last moment. I\u2019ve had a rough week and this was the first Saturday that I hadn\u2019t worked in a while.", "Thank you, I would love any explanation on what you think we could\u2019ve done to avoid this", "I\u2019m someone that struggles with events that creep up on me. Especially in my professional life where I now try to avoid that by checking my calendar 2 weeks in advance and then planning all my life around that. I\u2019m not some CEO level busy in my life, but I have a fairly tight schedule between work, non profit, and my only hobby which is fitness. I move my hobby around so I can spend more time with the gf but I\u2019ve stated multiple times that I dont do well with last minute surprises. And even if one comes up, I ask her not to get annoyed if i can\u2019t make it due to my work and non profit", "Thank you for your comment! \n\nI did express to her that I\u2019d be willing to drop off the medication if needed while she was at work but I got no response to that. \n\nI want our communication to be better and I\u2019ve said that multiple times, I just want to put everything on the table and leave nothing for interpretation, she agrees after every fight but it just comes back to the same thing\u2026 no matter how hard I try to verbalize every expectation, emotion, or decision.", "For the most part I\u2019m pretty relaxed with the events in the relationship. I\u2019m only sensitive when it comes to being called unreliable or undependable. I really love this girl and want it to work. \n\n I agree I should\u2019ve handled the lexapro situation better later at night, and admitted as such to her had I known the gravity of it.", "If it\u2019s just a dresser and not an entire house, could the converse also hold true that it could wait another day or didn\u2019t have to be moved that evening?", "OK..... If you can honestly say that you couldn't due to your mental or physical state and you were right at the edge of what you can do then fine.... I just get the feeling its more that you simply didn't want to rather than actually not being able to which are two very different things.", "Sounds to me like you guys both need to take a deep breath before talking so that you aren\u2019t yelling all the time.  I\u2019ll be clear, sometimes as the stronger of the partners in the relationship, I\u2019m asked to do more than my fair share of lifting heavy things, carrying them to another place, then putting them down.  It\u2019s kind of how things are. Many relationships are like this.  She needed new furniture and asked for your help as she physically couldn\u2019t move it. Don\u2019t you like her? Geez, YTA.", "100 lb dresser? Absolutely", "Of course ! Wishing you guys the best", "Based on you going to therapy for the past two years it sounds like you have a lot of issues too. Being too tired at 6pm to help move something is just a lame excuse honestly it probably wouldn\u2019t have hurt you at all to help. What\u2019s the point in asking you for anything then or being in a relationship with you. You\u2019re right, you should just break up obviously not compatible", "Edit", "I understand the emotion behind defining one\u2019s own crisis, I\u2019ve had a major crisis where I was panicking over going to a thanksgiving event at my friend\u2019s place 2 years ago (socially awkward around families) \n\nI can relate to a certain event causing panic but I don\u2019t like projecting that onto another person who may not be in the same state of mind as me \ud83d\ude05", "You're a guy, no one cares. If you was a woman, the tone would be different. Don't read too much into it bro. Take what they say with a pinch of salt, and continue to work progressively to your mental health.\n\nAnd try to do better, to what is possible.\n\nHang in there.", "Sit down and talk to her. Ask her what she needs, you also tell her what you need too", "I\u2019m not trying to blame you.  I\u2019m just pointing out that you can make communication better between you two and you can defuse things.  In my opinion and experience as a pretty touchy woman myself, how my SO responds to me or communicates with me can determine how I respond.  I think right now you are more in \u201creact\u201d mode.  But you can take control of things by communicating clearly with her and trying to find solutions for things.", "OK, so not doing exactly as she wants means you are now in an argument.\n\nPlease be really, really mindful of that. That will stay that way for a life time.  \nCan you condone that while being your own best friend? Can you see the role she has in mind for you?", "You sound like you're doing great. Just if she's on Lexapro I assume she has some form of depression/anxiety/bipolar...  Those can all be pretty hard and make you not see the positives when something goes wrong. I have anxiety and I know I can go from \"I got this, everything's perfect, I love my life\" all the way to \"everything's awful, I'm awful at everything, I'm an awful person\" just at one simple problem. It's more the anxiety talking. But she does need to get a handle on it and not take it out on you", "I think you need to keep reinforcing boundaries with her and also reinforcing how these urgent requests makes you feel. Ask her to include you in her decision making process vs issuing ultimatums. For example, her letting you know the urgency and importance of the medication would have helped empower you to understand that you needed to drop it off right away. Similarly, her involving you earlier on the drawer buying process would have allowed you to either reassure her panic or figure out a way to get the drawer to her that didn\u2019t make you feel like your Saturday was stolen with another chore.", "Seems like everyone else has already explained plenty. Communicate better. But do you really want to be with someone who makes you cry a whole night long?", "But now you know and you presumably wouldn't do it again.\n\nIt's rude of her to call you unreliable etc when she's springing this on you and you apologised for past mistakes?\n\nPeople saying you should have just helped at 6pm etc- some people have chronic illnesses, are working to burnout etc - it isn't always possible to drop everything and use a lot of energy at someone else's discretion.\n\nYour girlfriend sounds unreasonable and she's the ah in this situation. If these types of fights continue you will need to seriously think whether or not the relationship is healthy as it sounds like you'll end up walking on eggshells just to do right by her and that's just toxic.", "That was not the case. I just updated my main post to reflect the intention.", "The 100 lb dresser she got and had delivered without the foggiest clue of how to get it where it goes?\n\nYour shitty planning doesn't make something my priority. Not even because I don't want to because I am fine helping out but turning your shitty planning into me being unreliable is not going to happen.\n\nBut it ends earlier than that. Panic buying furniture is already crazy. You could have dealt with that by paying extra for it do be fully delivered but I guess that was a split second you were suddenly aware you had me to do it. Magically the awareness was gone again when it came to asking me when I could do it.\n\nIt's a no. To all of it.I don't play that game. I don't dance that dance. Go be upset and stay there until your medication kicks in.", "There is no need to use a tone so barb-wired. \n\nIt was the first Saturday in an entire month where we had already planned to watch a movie and have a relaxed night. After a long week, I think it\u2019s fair to have an expectation of no exertion. \n\nThanks", "Thank you for expanding on it! \n\nYes, I\u2019ve always been working on my self defense coping mechanisms in my personal and professional life. \nI want to be the rock for individuals I care about in my life, but I know my own limitations so I expressed exertion as a reason for not wanting to help. \n\nI just work better with a heads up so I can prepare.  \n\nBut I understand your point about criticism. I can empathize with her emotion at that time but her choice of words were hurtful.\nThanks", "Thanks man appreciate the kind words.", "Thanks! I have tried, I asked her many times during arguments as to what I can do to be a better partner and support her. I\u2019ve also mentioned that there are times I\u2019m constrained cause of my own commitments so if it is something on the lines of \u2018helping move\u2019 we plan it for a day, so I\u2019m prepared to help out.", "Yes I\u2019ve sensed it becoming a dangerous trend, which is why I asked her to seek help to work on her stuff because it\u2019s taxing for me to walk on eggshells all the time. \n\nShe\u2019s not a bad person at all, incredibly kind and helpful, would drop everything on her end to help me with something. But that\u2019s the thing, I don\u2019t want her to nor do I expect her to drop everything and come help me with something. \nThat\u2019s not how life works, I wanna be there for her all the time too, but there are cases where I can\u2019t take days off just to be with her and comfort her (I have done that once in the past).", "Thank you for you input. I\u2019m on medication for my own stuff for which I had sought both talk therapy and psychiatry in the past. I feel like I\u2019ve been in her shoes where I\u2019m stuck in panic moment due to forgetting things or failing to plan. Thing is, that\u2019s adulthood in general, shit happens all the time, I just wished it didn\u2019t get so bad in the arguments", "I totally understand! I want better communication and I\u2019ve conveyed that if I\u2019m lacking in someway on the verbal front, to let me know. I want this to work :/", "She's in the process of moving and needs a dresser.  I'm picturing throwing a box in the trunk and driving it to her new place.  Wouldn't be a big deal to me and would make her happy.", "If you\u2019re threatening to part ways with her over asking for help with something heavy when you obviously go to the gym and were planning to see her anyways then you\u2019ve already made up your mind. Do it sooner rather than later", "An argument is not the time to have this kind of conversation. Next time you are out or driving. Even sitting around just talking is when you bring it up. Babe I want things to work between us. Why don\u2019t we discuss what we would like more of from each other so we are not doing this over and over.or suggest you each take the time to right it down and give it to each other. just not during an argument", "Let me ask you something. How does she feels about your friends?", "Okay", "She likes all my friends. She\u2019s got no red flags at all! She\u2019s loyal and has the same values as I do. I just wish she\u2019d be better at throttling her reaction to panic in general. I was there in those same shoes when I used to lash out at my ex for minor inconveniences, therapy helps, I just wish she\u2019d seek it", ">She likes all my friends.\n\nWhat does that look like?\n\nWhy would she even panic about furniture being the wrong size?I am all about getting help. It's the adult thing to do. But what does she need help with?\n\nIs she entitled? Truly confused and upset? Or is she upset about not having someone always at the ready? Does she think you don't love her  if you are not willing to be her live in help?My advice is to put a finer point on it and talk to her about that. Also talk to her about it not being ok to throw you away the second she gets disappointed. Tell her you will not accept her carrying on and expecting everything to be fine the next day..", "I understand your points. All fair and valid. I will bring these up to my therapist as well. I hope she seeks help soon too. \nThank you so much", "Good luck!"]}
