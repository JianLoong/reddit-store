I told them no, and to stop.\n\n\nMy brother told me this might cause a rift in our relationship, I again said no and explained that the wedding is childfree. He asked again and pointed out how his baby is different since he's a rainbow, a miracle baby. I again said no and explained that the wedding is childfree.

That didn't get the message across, but sounds like the cards did the trick. \n\nI don't know how many times people need to be told .... Not your wedding, not your rules. \n\nNTA", "NTA Thwy didn\u2019t respect your no and maybe needed pictures instead of words. Some people need the visual, we all learn differently.", "NTA.

Very entitled to argue when you said no.", "NtA\n\nWish I'd done something similar for my wedding. Kids ruined things.", "NTA- and I would simply say that the disrespect occurred when asked for the nephew to attend being told no and not accepting the answer. Add that, had they accepted the polite version the first 117 times they brought it up, that would have and could have been the end of it. Nothing against nephew but, in fact, he is not the second coming of Christ, he is a child and this is a child free wedding. There is nothing to fix because one cannot reason with the unreasonable.", "Nta fix it by withdrawing their invitation. It\u2019s not hard to get a sitter for one night", "Unless being a \"miracle\" baby makes them not cry, be noisy and disruptive or get bored, you're nephew isn't any different from other children.\n\nWas it a little over the top? Yes.  Could you have simply said something like \"I'm sorry you won't be able to make it to the wedding\"? Sure.\n\nBut they weren't listening.\n\nNTA", "NTA - 3 years old isn't a baby so there should be no issues with leaving him or anything so they're throwing a tantrum over pure entitlement over who they want to attend.

Just be prepared for them showing up with the baby.", "They are raising that kid to think he\u2019s gods gift to earth. He\u2019s gonna be so narcissistic as an adult", "NTA, I think that\u2019s hilarious! That child sounds like hes being brought up to be entitled if his parents are treating him like the second coming. You probably just avoided a meltdown when you\u2019re saying your I dos!", "NTA - they are for continuing to try to change your mind after you said no the first time.

Their baby is a baby, regardless of how special it is to them, and is unwelcomed at your wedding. If you allow them, then you have to allow all babies. Tell him that the rift was already caused when he decided to hold tight on getting you to change your wedding plans for him, and follow up with why he thinks his input is valid for your wedding? The flash cards were a bit over the top, but so is their repeated request.

Yes it was unlikely and they are allowed to be happy and even celebrate this fact around the birth.\n\nHe's 3 now, he's a child, and instilling that he is more important/special than others due to the circumstances of his birth is a bad decision on their part.\n\nAlso it should go without saying, people are allowed childfree weddings.", "NTA, sometimes you just have to spell it out.", "Well, let me start by saying that you made a couple of mistakes.  \n\n1. No boom box.\n2. Not enough flash cards.\n\nYou missed a fantastic opportunity to press play on something like The Dan Band's version of Total Eclipse of the Heart (definitely a wedding song) while flipping cards \"Love Actually\" style.  I'm thinking you could have gotten all the way to:  \n\n\n* To me, your rainbow baby is perfect.\n* But you can't bring him or his rainbows to my wedding.\n\nAnd even if you had made it look all the while like you were going to give in and then dropped the hammer with the last card.  You are still:\n\nNTA.", "Definitely NTA.\n\nBonus points for the flash cards.

Which is to say, no special at all except to the child's parents. This miracle and rainbow baby stuff, well again, I'm glad they got their child after difficulties! A lot of folks don't get that opportunity! But the kid isn't Christ reborn and they need to get that out of their thick skulls.\n\nThe flashcards, honestly, are a solid way of showing that. If the rest of the family gives you trouble, be sure to let the others with kids know that they think their miracle child is more special than their normal, mundane children (Chris's words) and watch their support dry up.", "NTA. My go-to would usually be interpretive dance, but for this I might go full mime.\n\nStill, your flash cards sound funnier. Go you! Also good luck for the wedding.\n\nETA: The demand to 'fix it now' seems to be asking for more of the same. A lot more. \n\nYou know what to do.", "[removed]", "NTA - when I read the header I thought you were tha because kid was a baby. But a three y/o come in now. Now they\u2019re just manipulating.

I think your brother needs to look into why he can\u2019t leave his kid with a sitter", "NTA - Why do some parents think that their child is more special or important than somebody else\u2019s?

As I'm glad they finally got their toddler and have no doubt how much he's loved, this is way over the line. Btw the age 3 tends to be hellish as they are rebellious, loud, throw fits, I could go on and on. \n\nI'd have someone on hand to escort them from the wedding when they show up with him regardless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit for age clarification and adding on how hellish 3yo can be.", "NTA\nYou should have told them (or i would have) : \u201eAnd if its baby jesus himself, he\u2018s not invited!\u201c", "NTA.

They wanted everyone see how special he is. The fact he even pulled he is a miracle baby and his presence would bless your wedding is enough for anyone not to want to let him come. They are sitting this poor kid up for failure.

And he is going to be intolerable that he probably won\u2019t have friend.\n\nThey have already tried relentless to get you to change your mind and it failed. Next step is to show up with child in tow and call your bluff. I would have security in place to have them escorted out. I would make this known.

Congrats on the upcoming wedding OP!", "Lmfao NTA!  \n\n\nYou tried to be polite and to refuse them, but they ignored you.    \n\n\nThey tried again, and you were polite and  they ignored you.  \n\n\nThey tried again, and once again you were polite and said no and they ignored you.  \n\n\nThis time you took the cluex4 and wacked them with it, and now they're mad because you didn't cave to them.  \n\n\nFix nothing, he disrespected you by implying your wedding would only be blessed by his child being there and saying it would cause a rift if you didn't do what he wanted.  \n\n\nYou can tell him and your parents that you tried to be polite and firm with your no's but when they didn't listen you just played hardball.  \n\n\nGood job on sticking to a no.", "NTA. Hilarious and creative! No means no but clearly they don\u2019t respect your boundaries.", "What morons. The world totally revolves around their son. Nta", "NTA \n\nYou set a rule. When asked if you'd budge, you said \"no\". They pushed. You didn't move.\n\nIt may, unfortunately, be time to say, \"If you all can't/won't follow a simple rule or keep insisting the child come to the childfree event, I guess I'm gonna lose your invitations.\"", "Yeah...uhh...you were trying to piss them off, right? I mean...\nESH for sure.", "NTA. This is hilarious.", "NTA\n\n1) No is a full sentence. \n\n2) Everyone thinks their spawn is a miracle/treasure/blessing. Whatever. Newsflash: they are going to be just another asshole causing traffic on the freeway, annoying their coworkers, etc. Parents like that need a big old sign that says *Your kid is special to YOU, but your kid is not special*", "NTA- although I do agree with your parents about fixing it.  You should fix it by letting everyone know that your parents and brother and his family are no longer invited to the wedding (and if they keep it up..out of your life, permanently) send a family/group email/text explain everything about them choosing to disrespect you/ wife with their demands that you include his child in your CHILD FREE wedding.", "NTA\n\nWhat a shiny spine you have! That was brilliant.", "NTA the only disrespect I see is them insisting to bring a child free o a ChildFree wedding\u2026 I mean come on people, I\u2019m sure their child is absolutely the focus of their life hood for them, it\u2019s not their fault wedding, ugh", "NTA. The wedding is about the bride and groom. Nobody else. It drives me crazy when people don't listen. You said no several times and they refused to listen. A wedding is no place for children. Would they want to bring their baby to a bar???? A wedding reception is just that. Loud music and partying. Not a spot for kids. Not mention how bored the child would be anyway. Stand your ground and enjoy your day!!!", "NTA. Also a bit funny, though I can see why your parents might not find it funny. \n\nNo clue though why the couple was just becoming too attached to bring their child to a family wedding? I mean you literally have a free card to party hard or mellow- your style, and have some child free time as young parents. Why are you obsessing over whether the baby comes? \ud83c\udf08or not- kids are work and I\u2019ve seen parents desperate to catch a break with some kid free entertainment, not fight with people to bring them no matter what?", "NTA. They clearly didn\u2019t understand that they are miracle baby is a kid who cannot come to a childless wedding.", "NTA\n\nYou 'fix' it by fisinviting everyone who thinks they have a say in how your wedding goes \ud83d\ude0a\n\nAlso 3 isn't a baby that's a toddler whose at a stage where they are learning how the world works", "NTA. Some people are visual learners, you were just helping them out", "NTA\n\nA hilarious solution I think. They didn\u2019t accept your answer to their other 100 times of asking, they clearly weren\u2019t getting the message. If it\u2019s child free it\u2019s childfree, rainbow or not that is still a child. Arrange childcare or don\u2019t come.", "NTA. I\u2019m over these posts where people feel entitled to bring their kids to child free weddings because \u201cthey are special\u201d. While I can I understand your brother and SIL have had a tough go trying to conceive but their child is no more special than any other child. Many women struggle with fertility and it\u2019s always a joy when they finally conceive but again, the child is no more special than anyone else\u2019s kids. \n\nYou also are not picking and choosing which children can and cannot attend, MANY people have child free weddings because children can be loud and a distraction. What it seems to me is that they don\u2019t want to pay for childcare during your wedding and they\u2019re trying to guilt you into letting him come because he\u2019s \u201cspecial\u201d. If you let your nephew come it wouldn\u2019t be fair to not allow everyone else to bring their children", "NTA that is goddamn hilarious. They kept pushing the boundary and you held it firm in probably the funniest way possible", "NTA. I am happy that they have a healthy child, but this makes me wonder if this boy is going to spoiled. I guarantee the parents are going to constantly tell him that because he is a rainbow, baby, a miracle, baby, he is going to grow up feeling entitled.", "My definition of \"miracle baby\" would be one that never EVER cries and never poops.  Such a baby doesn't exist unless it's stuffed or plastic.", "Exactly! There are literally millions of \u201crainbow\u201d babies out there.
