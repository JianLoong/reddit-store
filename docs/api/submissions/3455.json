His wife kept sending my fiancee pics of my nephew when he was months old (what that mean??). I told them no, and to stop.\n\n\nMy brother told me this might cause a rift in our relationship, I again said no and explained that the wedding is childfree. He asked again and pointed out how his baby is different since he's a rainbow, a miracle baby. I again said no and explained that the wedding is childfree.

That didn't get the message across, but sounds like the cards did the trick. \n\nI don't know how many times people need to be told .... Not your wedding, not your rules. \n\nNTA", "NTA Thwy didn\u2019t respect your no and maybe needed pictures instead of words. Some people need the visual, we all learn differently.", "NTA.

Very entitled to argue when you said no.", "NtA\n\nWish I'd done something similar for my wedding. Kids ruined things.", "NTA- and I would simply say that the disrespect occurred when asked for the nephew to attend being told no and not accepting the answer. Add that, had they accepted the polite version the first 117 times they brought it up, that would have and could have been the end of it. Nothing against nephew but, in fact, he is not the second coming of Christ, he is a child and this is a child free wedding. There is nothing to fix because one cannot reason with the unreasonable.", "Nta fix it by withdrawing their invitation. It\u2019s not hard to get a sitter for one night", "Unless being a \"miracle\" baby makes them not cry, be noisy and disruptive or get bored, you're nephew isn't any different from other children.\n\nWas it a little over the top? Yes.  Could you have simply said something like \"I'm sorry you won't be able to make it to the wedding\"? Sure.\n\nBut they weren't listening.\n\nNTA", "NTA - 3 years old isn't a baby so there should be no issues with leaving him or anything so they're throwing a tantrum over pure entitlement over who they want to attend.

Just be prepared for them showing up with the baby.", "They are raising that kid to think he\u2019s gods gift to earth. He\u2019s gonna be so narcissistic as an adult", "NTA, I think that\u2019s hilarious! That child sounds like hes being brought up to be entitled if his parents are treating him like the second coming. You probably just avoided a meltdown when you\u2019re saying your I dos!", "NTA - they are for continuing to try to change your mind after you said no the first time.

Their baby is a baby, regardless of how special it is to them, and is unwelcomed at your wedding. If you allow them, then you have to allow all babies. Tell him that the rift was already caused when he decided to hold tight on getting you to change your wedding plans for him, and follow up with why he thinks his input is valid for your wedding? The flash cards were a bit over the top, but so is their repeated request.

Yes it was unlikely and they are allowed to be happy and even celebrate this fact around the birth.\n\nHe's 3 now, he's a child, and instilling that he is more important/special than others due to the circumstances of his birth is a bad decision on their part.\n\nAlso it should go without saying, people are allowed childfree weddings.", "NTA, sometimes you just have to spell it out.", "Well, let me start by saying that you made a couple of mistakes.  \n\n1. No boom box.\n2. Not enough flash cards.\n\nYou missed a fantastic opportunity to press play on something like The Dan Band's version of Total Eclipse of the Heart (definitely a wedding song) while flipping cards \"Love Actually\" style.  I'm thinking you could have gotten all the way to:  \n\n\n* To me, your rainbow baby is perfect.\n* But you can't bring him or his rainbows to my wedding.\n\nAnd even if you had made it look all the while like you were going to give in and then dropped the hammer with the last card.  You are still:\n\nNTA.", "Definitely NTA.\n\nBonus points for the flash cards.

Which is to say, no special at all except to the child's parents. This miracle and rainbow baby stuff, well again, I'm glad they got their child after difficulties! A lot of folks don't get that opportunity! But the kid isn't Christ reborn and they need to get that out of their thick skulls.\n\nThe flashcards, honestly, are a solid way of showing that. If the rest of the family gives you trouble, be sure to let the others with kids know that they think their miracle child is more special than their normal, mundane children (Chris's words) and watch their support dry up.", "NTA. My go-to would usually be interpretive dance, but for this I might go full mime.\n\nStill, your flash cards sound funnier. Go you! Also good luck for the wedding.\n\nETA: The demand to 'fix it now' seems to be asking for more of the same. A lot more. \n\nYou know what to do.", "[removed]", "NTA - when I read the header I thought you were tha because kid was a baby. But a three y/o come in now. Now they\u2019re just manipulating.

I think your brother needs to look into why he can\u2019t leave his kid with a sitter", "NTA - Why do some parents think that their child is more special or important than somebody else\u2019s?

As I'm glad they finally got their toddler and have no doubt how much he's loved, this is way over the line. Btw the age 3 tends to be hellish as they are rebellious, loud, throw fits, I could go on and on. \n\nI'd have someone on hand to escort them from the wedding when they show up with him regardless.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit for age clarification and adding on how hellish 3yo can be.", "NTA\nYou should have told them (or i would have) : \u201eAnd if its baby jesus himself, he\u2018s not invited!\u201c", "NTA.

They wanted everyone see how special he is. The fact he even pulled he is a miracle baby and his presence would bless your wedding is enough for anyone not to want to let him come. They are sitting this poor kid up for failure.

And he is going to be intolerable that he probably won\u2019t have friend.\n\nThey have already tried relentless to get you to change your mind and it failed. Next step is to show up with child in tow and call your bluff. I would have security in place to have them escorted out. I would make this known.

I understand asking if an exception could be made because it is a sibling, however, once told no..a normal response would be that they understand.

We took my MIL and she stayed at the hotel with her. However when we got to the wedding, there were several kids there and they all caused a ruckus.

They acted super entitled. What is it with people who have a hard time conceiving and acting like their kid is the center of everyone else's world? NTA, easily.

They were not getting it before so you had to put in elementary school level for them. Their child is not special to anyone but them. I applaud your efforts!", "NTA.  I have been taught that 'three times' is the magic number in polite behavior. You don't ask more than three times - unless you have a very very extremely good reason to ask yet another time. And when asked a fourth time you must wonder why. Is there maybe something more to a situation and should you give in, or are you indeed now in your right to 'blow up'. \n\nA good reason could be somebody trying to get somebody to come to a surprise party, or something like that. A situation that is not what it seems. And even then, the one asking must be prepared to fail. Or as a last measure reveal the real reason.\n\nIn this case it seems that everything had been revealed, and was repeatedly denied. More than three times. So the consequences of their actions are on them. \n\nOf course it is very unfortunate that the whole family seems invested in this miracle baby.

And that\u2019s *totally* worth celebrating.\n\nBut going on to treat said child like they are made more important than other humans because of this fact is an unhealthy way to deal with the trauma of the previous losses.  It makes sense.  After all the pain and grief, there\u2019s an intense amount of relief and a stronger fear of losing that child.
