We're very excited and nervous. \n\nEmma is on leave at the moment, but will be going back to work once the baby is born. I'll be taking a year out to care for the baby. There are a number of reasons for this. While I'm lucky enough to earn an above average salary, Emma works in a very specialist field (she leads high level medical/treatment research projects) and earns about 4x as much as I do. Also, while I enjoy my job, it's not that important to me. It's just something I do to earn a living. For Emma, she's very passionate about using her talents to make the world a better place, so her work is extremely important to her. \n\nThe issue is that Emma is disabled. She has a very severe visual impairment. She does wear glasses but even with a high prescription, she can't see well enough to drive, can only read very large lettering, and struggles to see in the dark unless its well-lit. Without glasses she can't even get around our own house. \n\nEmma went for lunch with her parents yesterday and came back sobbing. She said her mum and dad thought I \"wasn't doing right by her\" and that I \"should be protecting her\". They brought up all these possibilities, like what if she ends up without her glasses or there are no trains home. They said that she has \"the right to be provided for while she cares for her baby\". Worst of all, her mum said I was \"Taking advantage of a disabled woman\". \n\nHer parents have made their opinions on our plans clear for a while now, but I think they thought we'd change our minds. Now that we're close to baby coming, they've told us exactly what they think of us. \n\nEmma is devastated and I'm raging. First off, this is what SHE wanted. If Emma really wanted to spend time with the baby, I'd have been fine going back to work. Secondly, all these potential situations are things she already has to deal with. Why does the fact that she's a mother change that? Would being a father change it for me if I had her condition? \n\nI've not spoken to her parents because I don't want to stress Emma out any more. I don't *think* I'm taking advantage of her. I adore Emma and want her to be happy. We just want to do what's best for ourselves and our baby. \n\nSo, WIBTA?", "created_utc": 1674383178, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10igm7q/wibta_for_being_a_stay_at_home_dad_while_my/", "score": 700, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nothing.", "NTA. Who cares for your baby is the business of you and Emma and absolutely ZERO other people.

The only one who should be treated like an infant is your actual soon-to-be-born infant.\n\nFirst: The only ones who get to decide what\u2019s right for your family are you and Emma. \n\nSecond: I follow a number of disabled YouTubers, and one of the common things they rally against is the assumption that people who are disabled are incapable of doing things for themselves. I think it\u2019s a common misconception that leads to a lot of un- and under-employment in the disabled community. Emma\u2019s parents seem to be subscribing to this mindset.

And good luck with the new baby :)", "Def NTA.\n\nIf the decision aligns with both of your wants, then this is what you should do. Who cares what others think, even if they're her parents? They are weaponizing her disability, as though she isn't a capable human being. I'm almost 100% sure that Emma is a lot stronger than her parents give her credit for. Disabled ppl are freaking resilient AF. I'd go LC or even NC with the parents, since they don't have faith in their own flesh and blood.", "NTA.

You have clearly looked at the circumstances and made an informed choice as a couple. Emma\u2019s disability has not hindered her career so far so why should she give it up? Her parents are being overly protective of that without considering what she wants. They have overstepped her boundaries because they are her parents but that doesn\u2019t mean she has to listen to them. She is a grown woman and if that\u2019s the best choice for your family then it shouldn\u2019t matter what her parents say.", "YWNBTA Emma isn't their baby anymore.

It's sad that they would harangue their pregnant daughter for her choices. Were they supportive of the pregnancy before this revelation?\n\nAll of their arguments about safety risks to their daughter apply equally to their grandchild when in their daughters care with the exception that they'll likely happen in the home with no witnesses or help compared to your wife's workplace.", "NTA it\u2019s not their decision or business to make, as long as Emma has been honest to you and told them exactly the same, and hasn\u2019t been talked into the decision reluctantly.", "NTA", "NTA I am so sorry that Emma's parents are being so demanding as well as insensitive to what their OWN daughter wants. Just...WOOOWWW! This is NOT THEIR LIFE, NOT THEIR DECISION. If this is what you and Emma planned all along, go for it. There is no longer a \"rule book\" for who stays home and who goes back to work after the baby comes. Hell, both can go to work...it doesn't matter to society as a whole. Their ideology is stuck back in 1965 somewhere and has NO PLACE in YOUR LIFE (talking about your life as a couple, as parents).  \n\nIn their minds she is evidently still a little girl who needs help instead of a fierce badass independent woman who has a passion for her research and wants to make the world better with her knowledge and discoveries. And make no mistake, she IS FIERCE and BADASS for making the choice she made...she just can't be super strong with her parents because they know which buttons to push for maximum pain.  She is already dealing with pregnancy brain and overwhelming hormones that REALLY  mess with emotions. Her being disabled and pregnant has taken a toll on her and her parents chose the perfect moment to be verbally abusive towards her.  Instead of BUILDING HER UP and SUPPORTING her, they chose to tear her down for a choice you two arrived at together. She tried to stand up to them, but without you by her side for moral support she crumbled. It would not be out of line for you to sound off on her parents, but you need to check with Emma first before you go and tell them they cannot make decisions for you as a couple because it is not their marriage, not their baby and NOT. THEIR.

(To be clear, this isn\u2019t something you MUST do, and you wouldn\u2019t be an asshole for not doing it.) Some friends of mine who decided the new dad would stay at home ran into a lot of pushback from her parents, so they told them they had a deadline - when the youngest child they have goes to kindergarten - for him to return to work. In reality, they have an agreement to reassess every year, in case he decides at some point he\u2019d like to go back to school, or find a job, etc.\nBut that deadline made them simmer down a bit.

She might want to breastfeed from the chest as it has several benefits including jaw development and creating a good gut biome - that will mean at least 4 months of her working very little. She may also have a c section which means 2 months of no extensive walking. She may also feel differently about taking care of the baby after birth. You may also just not be a very good stay at home dad providing cleaning and childcare so she will be doing more - also why can\u2019t you take care of the baby AND drive your wife to work everyday? Like that shouldn\u2019t even be a question I think.

Maybe she will pump milk on bottles at home, so he can feed him breast milk. Maybe she won't feel different about taking care after birth. Maybe he is good or maybe even better as stay at home parent. Maybe they the baby has to have diaper change just when he has to give her a lift to work and now she is late from work and maybe she gets fired.

She can't drive, can't read signs at a distance, and without her glasses she can't navigate her own house. \n\n[The National Federation for the Blind](https://nfb.org/resources/blindness-statistics) says that people are blind \"if their sight is bad enough -even with corrective lenses- that they must use alternative methods to engage in any activity that people with normal vision would do using their eyes.\" For example, taking a train instead of driving, because even with her glasses, she can't drive due to her vision. By that definition, Emma is blind. And while I don't know where OP is located, in the US someone is considered legally disabled if they have \"a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities\", including seeing ([source](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/12102)). If Emma lives in the US, she is legally disabled. \n\nI think you're well-intentioned, but the idea that disabled people aren't able to work or earn money, or the idea that people who *can* work aren't experiencing a disability is really harmful. People like Emma often need accommodations for their disability in the workplace, and disability advocates have fought for years to ensure that those accommodations are legally protected. The argument that someone who can work isn't disabled has often been used to deny people accommodations, medical treatment, and support, so I'd be careful about repeating it, especially about someone who clearly identifies as disabled.", "This is what made me mad too. Humans are incredibly adaptive. Even with full vision loss she'd still be able to work in her current field. Its so wrong to underestimate her just because of her vision.", "I agree with you, but if she quit working then 4/5 of the family income would disappear. x = OP's income, 4x = wife's income, 5x = total family income", "But nothing was mentioned about breast feeding, in her parents' arguments, but they literally said op is taking advantage of the disabled... so what was the point of your reply?", "Curious as to where else you would breastfeed from? \nSounds more like the wife has spent her life being pushed around by her parents and now she is living her life how she wants, making decisions with her husband about what she wants to do and is happy. And yes you can take the disability away, its a visibility disability, not a her mental age is that of a toddler disability. The challenges she faces haven't changed just because of a baby.", "Do you have trouble with reading comprehension? She is sad because the very ah that are her parents just insulted her.", "Or Emma's upset by how her parents treated her, their opinion of her and their opinion of her husband.", "Emma is pregnant and due in a week, so it's better to ask her what she thinks rather than to assume based on her emotional reaction.", "And with her good income she can get a pair of back up glasses.  It also is kind of ableist of her parents to presume she needs to stay home and be taken care of.", "In fact if he\u2019s not working anymore, he\u2019s probably in a better place to pick her up in an emergency than when he was working as well", "I don\u2019t know why having a near-blind person at home alone with the baby would be better than this arrangement anyway. Not saying she\u2019d be unable to care for it (it sounds like she\u2019d be perfectly capable), but I just don\u2019t get the parents\u2019 reasoning here. NTA for sure.", "That's what's rubbing me the wrong way about this. There seems to be a bit of ableism and probably some sexism/misogyny.

And that the man should provide for his wife.  And are trying to use every fear and anxiety that she might have and imagined scenario to get her to change her mind\n\nWhich would then.. what? Mean the family gets 1/4 of the income, the husband does something he doesn\u2019t love but feels like he has to, the wife stays home where she\u2019s not fulfilled by the job that she loves.  So that they can fit into some outdated viewpoint?\n\nOP, tell your wife she is a badass scientist who is the very definition of a role model and a kick ass human being!  I mean, you sound great and all but honestly, she is the exact type of person we need in this world!  Don\u2019t let her dim her light over this\n\nAnd good luck with the baby!

Emma has every right to be a productive citizen and find happiness with you. And the two of you have obviously found love with one another. Is it wrong? Nobody can decide that except you and Emma. Not Emma's parents since you're about to be parents, yourselves, with this new addition to your family with Emma. So, in my humble opinion, nobody can possibly lead your lives for you expect the two of you, now, especially when you and Emma are about to become a family. If Emma's parents do not want her with you, just remind them it's not their relationship they are in with you. It's yours and Emma's. If they still don't accept you and Emma in such a relationship, it's time to close ranks with them and move forward with yours and Emma's life and your relationship. It wouldn't be good for the baby if this stressor/trigger continues. You must think about what's in the best interest of your child that you're about to have as a couple. Remember, it's not about Emma's parents. It's ultimately about the wellbeing of yours and Emma's newest addition to your family.

We made this plan based on what your expressed passion for your work.
