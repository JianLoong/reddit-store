We're very excited and nervous. \n\nEmma is on leave at the moment, but will be going back to work once the baby is born. I'll be taking a year out to care for the baby. There are a number of reasons for this. While I'm lucky enough to earn an above average salary, Emma works in a very specialist field (she leads high level medical/treatment research projects) and earns about 4x as much as I do. Also, while I enjoy my job, it's not that important to me. It's just something I do to earn a living. For Emma, she's very passionate about using her talents to make the world a better place, so her work is extremely important to her. \n\nThe issue is that Emma is disabled. She has a very severe visual impairment. She does wear glasses but even with a high prescription, she can't see well enough to drive, can only read very large lettering, and struggles to see in the dark unless its well-lit. Without glasses she can't even get around our own house. \n\nEmma went for lunch with her parents yesterday and came back sobbing. She said her mum and dad thought I \"wasn't doing right by her\" and that I \"should be protecting her\". They brought up all these possibilities, like what if she ends up without her glasses or there are no trains home. They said that she has \"the right to be provided for while she cares for her baby\". Worst of all, her mum said I was \"Taking advantage of a disabled woman\". \n\nHer parents have made their opinions on our plans clear for a while now, but I think they thought we'd change our minds. Now that we're close to baby coming, they've told us exactly what they think of us. \n\nEmma is devastated and I'm raging. First off, this is what SHE wanted. If Emma really wanted to spend time with the baby, I'd have been fine going back to work. Secondly, all these potential situations are things she already has to deal with. Why does the fact that she's a mother change that? Would being a father change it for me if I had her condition? \n\nI've not spoken to her parents because I don't want to stress Emma out any more. I don't *think* I'm taking advantage of her. I adore Emma and want her to be happy. We just want to do what's best for ourselves and our baby. \n\nSo, WIBTA?", "created_utc": 1674383178, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10igm7q/wibta_for_being_a_stay_at_home_dad_while_my/", "score": 99, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You take away the disability part and you've got someone doing something that they love and believe in, while getting paid nicely for it. Sounds like your partner isn't letting her disability hold her back and define her.", "So she's been working for atleast 10 years and all those scenarios existed before - so its not her disability. They are misogynistic and think a woman should stay at home with the baby, is the property of the husband who should care for  her.\n\nOtherwise what is different to 5 years ago when she was working too? Nothing.", "NTA. Who cares for your baby is the business of you and Emma and absolutely ZERO other people.  Emma needs to let her parents know, in no uncertain terms, that if they want to be in your lives, the comments about your choices regarding your baby stop NOW. Better yet, talk to them together and tell them this. \n\nIf you don't draw that line and stick to it, this is not the last time they will try to tell you how to raise your child. Boundaries are crucial here.", "NTA. Emma\u2019s parents seem to be under the impression that, since Emma has a disability, they should treat her like an infant without autonomy or desires of her own. They are wrong. The only one who should be treated like an infant is your actual soon-to-be-born infant.\n\nFirst: The only ones who get to decide what\u2019s right for your family are you and Emma. \n\nSecond: I follow a number of disabled YouTubers, and one of the common things they rally against is the assumption that people who are disabled are incapable of doing things for themselves. I think it\u2019s a common misconception that leads to a lot of un- and under-employment in the disabled community. Emma\u2019s parents seem to be subscribing to this mindset. And it\u2019s BS. \n\nConsole Emma, work together to put boundaries up between you two and her parents, and enjoy your new baby!", "NTA this is what you and Emma wanted, she needs to tell her family that and tell them she is a strong independent woman that doesn't want to spend her whole life terrorfied.\n\nGet her a second pair of glasses to carry with her for extra price of mind.", "NTA.  Emma earns more, and WANTS to go back to work.  It makes sense for you to be a SAHD.\n\nEmma's parents are sexist AHs.  You are not taking advantage of Emma; you are the one who is going to be stuck at home with a screaming poopy baby for the next year.", "NTA\n\nThis was a decision made by you and your wife, based on what Emma wanted to do. Every family is different, what\u2019s best for one family could be another\u2019s worst nightmare.\n\nEmma needs to tell her parents to back the fuck off. Emma is clearly a strong, independent woman who knows her own mind. The two of you need to present a united front on this. Stand strong together. And good luck with the new baby :)", "Def NTA.\n\nIf the decision aligns with both of your wants, then this is what you should do. Who cares what others think, even if they're her parents? They are weaponizing her disability, as though she isn't a capable human being. I'm almost 100% sure that Emma is a lot stronger than her parents give her credit for. Disabled ppl are freaking resilient AF. I'd go LC or even NC with the parents, since they don't have faith in their own flesh and blood.", "NTA.  Are her parents not proud of her at all for all her career accomplishments?  What is wrong with them?  A second pair of glasses for peace of mind and low contact with her parents seems the way to go.", "NTA \n\nParents have a tendency to be overprotective of their children.  Emma, no matter how old, will always be their baby, to be loved and protected, no matter how old she gets.  I'm a parent myself and I sometimes have trouble with letting go.\n\nIf this is what Emma wants and you are supporting her in her wishes definitely not the A.\n\nHave her parents been over protective of her when she was growing up?\n\nPossibly sit down with Emma and talk it through.  Let her know she's not in the wrong.  Start going through their behavior when she was young.  When she started going to school. What were they like when she started dating?  Ask the questions, don't give her the answers.  Let her talk it out herself.", "Nta your girl needs to tell her parents this is what she wants and to leave you alone. And i don't understand how being a stay at home dad to a newborn is taking advantage. Gonna be a lot of work.", "NTA. Everything is planned and both already agreed to the setup as a couple. Though I understand your in laws' concern, but they have crossed their boundaries for assuming such things which hurt Emma and makes them the assholes.", "WNBTA\n\nFristly, congratulations on the pregnancy. Secondly, you aren't \"taking advantage\" of your girlfriend. From what I can tell, this was a decision you made together after weighing the pros and cons.\n\nThe scenarios they presented \"what if she ends up without her glasses\" and \"what if there's no trains\" were already possibilities well before she was pregnant. Bringing it up now seems like they're just making excuses for her to stay home.\n\nHer parents sound like they're hung up on the archaic idea that it's the *mother's responsibility* to stay at home and raise the baby. Frankly, if they don't like your arrangement they can just suck it up. It's the 21st century and it's not their baby.", "NTA - Emma can make decisions about herself, not her overprotective parents.", "Are you happy with the proposed arrangement? Is Emma? Sounds like it, in which case everyone else can go boil their heads.\\\n\\\nNTA.", "NTA. The reasons for Emma going back to work are very fair. Gone are the days when men went back to work just because they were the man.\n\nHer parents sound old-fashioned and I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a way of being there for Emma - like picking her up if there are no trains - and still being a SAHD.", "NTA, if this is what you both want. Her parents have been protecting her all her life so this is where they go to naturally. Your wife is an adult and no doubt has plans in place on what to do if anything happens to her glasses or there\u2019s a public transport failure. Hopefully when they see you\u2019re both happy and their grandchild is thriving they\u2019ll keep their opinions to themselves.", "NTA - what\u2019s best for you and your wife is up to you guys to decide as a family. You have clearly looked at the circumstances and made an informed choice as a couple. Emma\u2019s disability has not hindered her career so far so why should she give it up? Her parents are being overly protective of that without considering what she wants. They have overstepped her boundaries because they are her parents but that doesn\u2019t mean she has to listen to them. She is a grown woman and if that\u2019s the best choice for your family then it shouldn\u2019t matter what her parents say.", "YWNBTA Emma isn't their baby anymore. She is a grown woman who knows what she wants and has a partner who's willing to assist with that happening.", "NTA it\u2019s between you and your partner to decide, the fact she has a visual impairment doesn\u2019t impact her job so it looks like it\u2019s just her parents being ableist, intentional or not", "NTA\n\nHer parents are understandably protective but seem to have a low opinion of you. It's sad that they would harangue their pregnant daughter for her choices. Were they supportive of the pregnancy before this revelation?\n\nAll of their arguments about safety risks to their daughter apply equally to their grandchild when in their daughters care with the exception that they'll likely happen in the home with no witnesses or help compared to your wife's workplace.", "NTA it\u2019s not their decision or business to make, as long as Emma has been honest to you and told them exactly the same, and hasn\u2019t been talked into the decision reluctantly.", "NTA", "NTA I am so sorry that Emma's parents are being so demanding as well as insensitive to what their OWN daughter wants. Just...WOOOWWW! This is NOT THEIR LIFE, NOT THEIR DECISION. If this is what you and Emma planned all along, go for it. There is no longer a \"rule book\" for who stays home and who goes back to work after the baby comes. Hell, both can go to work...it doesn't matter to society as a whole. Their ideology is stuck back in 1965 somewhere and has NO PLACE in YOUR LIFE (talking about your life as a couple, as parents).  \n\nIn their minds she is evidently still a little girl who needs help instead of a fierce badass independent woman who has a passion for her research and wants to make the world better with her knowledge and discoveries. And make no mistake, she IS FIERCE and BADASS for making the choice she made...she just can't be super strong with her parents because they know which buttons to push for maximum pain.  She is already dealing with pregnancy brain and overwhelming hormones that REALLY  mess with emotions. Her being disabled and pregnant has taken a toll on her and her parents chose the perfect moment to be verbally abusive towards her.  Instead of BUILDING HER UP and SUPPORTING her, they chose to tear her down for a choice you two arrived at together. She tried to stand up to them, but without you by her side for moral support she crumbled. It would not be out of line for you to sound off on her parents, but you need to check with Emma first before you go and tell them they cannot make decisions for you as a couple because it is not their marriage, not their baby and NOT. THEIR. LIFE.\n\nGet on with your bad self and support and fight for that fierce wife of yours who is a fuckin rock star to me!", "NTA\n\nIf this is what Emma wants and you are happy with the arrangement then you should stay at home and Emma should go back to work. \n\nHer parents are just trying to protect their child. Emma needs to be clear that it's what she wants. And if they insist on upsetting their pregnant daughter then perhaps some space might be required.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like Emma's parents want her to play the disabled card and do little and having someone else do all the providing because she's owed... because she's disabled.\n\nEmma sounds like an amazing person who loves her job.  Her parents should be supporting her wishes and not making her feel bad about herself.\n\nThey may find themselves having little to do with Emma, you and any children you have if they want to belittle her achievements and try and force their opinions on you all.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
