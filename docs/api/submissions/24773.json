Mom's not going to listen to criticism of the Golden Child from the Scape Goat.  That always falls on deaf ears or gets flipped back onto the Scape Goat being an unreasonable AH.  Firm \"No!\" is about all you'll be able to get through to her.", "NTA \n\nI get this so much. The fact that your mom asked you to do it \"for her\" is so telling. Letting her know the why's & how you feel is perfectly okay. It's your wedding & life, therefore it's *you* who gets final say. \n\nThat being said, don't expect her or your family to react well when facing the truth to their actions. While it'd be nice if she/they can see what they did was wrong, that's not a guarantee. Prepare yourself for the denial/blame/guilt train. Go in knowing what you're going to say & the consequences of whatever you're met with (what you're prepared to do). Ask to speak uninterrupted & don't raise your voice. Remaining calm might be tough, but it will get your point across & leave no room for the \"you're just being xyz\" comments/excuses. Good luck, OP!", "NTA\n\nSister or not, MOH should be someone close to you, in this case she isn\u2019t. If it\u2019s brought up again firmly tell your mom no and that you will not be speaking about it anymore.", "NTA. Your wedding, you get to choose. If your sister asks why she wasn\u2019t included, it might be a good opportunity to have a discussion in the hopes of mending a bridge.", "When your mother gets married she can have her daughter in the wedding party. \n\n There are only TWO people that need to be happy that day and it is you and your fiance.   So you have who you want in the wedding party.\n\nAnd no you WNBTA if your mom brings it up again and you explain to her why.", "NTA\n\nBut I would encourage you to learn not to [JADE](https://psychcentral.com/blog/imperfect/2018/03/dealing-with-difficult-family-members-dont-justify-argue-defend-or-explain#:~:text=Learning%20to%20not%20justify%2C%20argue,more%20peace%20to%20your%20life.)\n\nDirectly tell your mom, \u201cNo.\u201d You will not be including your sister in your bridal party, and you would really appreciate it if she stopped pressuring you. You don\u2019t have to Justify yourself, Argue why you are correct, Defend your position, or Explain yourself. Simply state your decision and that\u2019s it.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to have anyone in your bridal party that you don't want there. \n\nYou don't owe your mother an explanation. Just tell her that you have made your decision and that's the end of the discussion. If your mum keeps pushing, you can let her say her piece and just stick to a script such as \"mum, we've discussed this already. My bridal party is set. I'm not changing my mind.\" Don't engage. Don't elaborate. Elaborating only gives her ways of questioning your choices with statements like \"what your sister did isn't that bad\" or \"you should forgive her because she's family\".  Don't give her any ammunition.", "NTA but the real problem are your parents not your sister. Feels messed up you\u2019re hating on her for your parents ignoring you and it seems like she didn\u2019t even love the attention.", "NTA - your wedding your choice. I married about 16 months ago and didn\u2019t have my sister in the bridal reason. The reasons, compared to yours, are same same but different. I don\u2019t regret anything about my day and would do it the exact same if I had the chance. Stick to your guns. All the best for the big day!", "NTA - whatever the story is, it is your wedding and you do what makes you feel best. If your sister is mature, she will not question it, your mother on the other hand needs to be educated by you about what will make you feel happiest during your wedding.", "NTA.\n\nWhen my mother married my father, she was ordered by her parents to have her sister as bridesmaid. Mom did not want to, for reasons I will not go into here. There was only going to be one bridesmaid, and Mom wanted to choose her best friend. But this was the 1950s, and you did what you were told. You did not argue back to your parents.\n\nFor more than 60 years, Mom was resentful that she did not get to choose her own bridesmaid.\n\nDon't let that happen to you. Don't be still having regrets 60 years later. Stand your ground.\n\nI wouldn't waste my breath explaining why, though. Whenever you present reasons to someone, you just give them ammunition to argue with you. Your mom will say you are exaggerating, or that never happened, or she had good reasons to do what she did, or you're just jealous, or you're being petty for holding a grudge after all this time, or... or... or... \n\nDon't give her a chance to argue back. \"No\" is a complete sentence. \"No, Mom, I am not having Sister as my maid of honor. The subject is closed. If you mention it again, I will walk out of the room / hang up the phone.\" Then do so.", "NTA \n\nI believe open communication is always the best policy.  You have always been in your sister's shadow, and now it's time for you to be in the spotlight. Your mother needs to know exactly how you feel and that she needs to forget about you including your sister in the wedding party.", "NTA, I feel that you have the right to choose your wedding party and if you don't want your sister in it, the she shouldn't be in it. I would take a few moments to write down your thoughts so you can express them to your family in person, and expect some backlash and gaslighting about how it \"wasn't that bad\" or \"but family first\" etc. Just say your feelings, and be prepared to grey rock or temporarily silence your phone.", "NTA. Your mum needs to stop badgering, it\u2019s not her wedding", "NTA. If your mother isn't contributing to the wedding she has no say. I think you would be justified in telling her why, but with this history, she may not be ready to accept what you're saying. On another note, if family photos are this much of a problem, you may have to think carefully about your wedding photos - your sister could potentially cause another drama.", "NTA for whatever choice you make, it is your wedding after all. I would just factor in how your decision would affect your relationship with your mom, sister, and possibly other members of your family. And I mean from feelings of your side of the relationships, not theirs.", "Nta\n\nTell her why \n\nDo it for your younger self be heard be seen", "NTA - Your wedding. You get to choose who stands with you on your big day. Period.", "YWBTA\n\nYour issue should be with your parents not your sister. Your mother wants you to include her \u201cfor her\u201d. So that\u2019s an issue with your mother. It\u2019s your wedding, your vision. \n\nAlso just stop discussing plans about your wedding with anyone if you don\u2019t want to hear their opinions.", "Gently, and with much empathy . . . YTA.\n\nI was honestly going to say E-S-H, because you certainly aren't required to have anyone in your bridal party that you don't want or aren't close to, including your sister. But while there is an argument to be made for your mother (and father) being an AH in general based on the bulk of your post, from the sound of it she didn't make a fuss and she wasn't pushy. She literally just asked if you'd consider putting your only sister in the bridal party. And a polite request doesn't ever really make someone an AH, since it can be refused just as politely.\n\nBut while you absolutely don't have to have your sister as a bridal attendant, this entire post is you explaining that your reasoning is, essentially, that you resent the hell out of her (and are seemingly determined to exclude and punish her for it) . . . because of *things that other people did, that she had no control over*. Especially as a child. \n\nYou're an AH because your resentment is valid (my sister resented me for years because our parents ignored her when I was extremely ill as a kid, and she felt deeply neglected, so I'm intimately familiar with this dynamic), but you're blaming it on someone who was entirely innocent. Your parents were adults, fully in control of their own choices . . . and they made the choice to focus on her and ignore you. She had nothing to do with that. \n\nAnd it was one thing for you to resent her as a child, when you couldn't comprehend that. But you're an adult now . . . and yet you still view her as the enemy instead of the parents who chose to make you the least of their priorities.\n\nI'm not saying that you have to be best friends, or make her your bridesmaid, but at the very least, you should be seeking therapy to explore why you still blame her for their behaviour. In the meantime, YTA, not for not wanting her as a bridesmaid, but for literally telling the culprit - your mother - that you blame her actions on your sister.", "thats fucked dude..  yta just wna see u grow no judgment :l", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
