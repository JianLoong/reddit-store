Go in knowing what you're going to say & the consequences of whatever you're met with (what you're prepared to do). Ask to speak uninterrupted & don't raise your voice.

You did not argue back to your parents.\n\nFor more than 60 years, Mom was resentful that she did not get to choose her own bridesmaid.\n\nDon't let that happen to you. Don't be still having regrets 60 years later. Stand your ground.\n\nI wouldn't waste my breath explaining why, though. Whenever you present reasons to someone, you just give them ammunition to argue with you. Your mom will say you are exaggerating, or that never happened, or she had good reasons to do what she did, or you're just jealous, or you're being petty for holding a grudge after all this time, or... or... or... \n\nDon't give her a chance to argue back. \"No\" is a complete sentence. \"No, Mom, I am not having Sister as my maid of honor.

YTA.\n\nI was honestly going to say E-S-H, because you certainly aren't required to have anyone in your bridal party that you don't want or aren't close to, including your sister. But while there is an argument to be made for your mother (and father) being an AH in general based on the bulk of your post, from the sound of it she didn't make a fuss and she wasn't pushy. She literally just asked if you'd consider putting your only sister in the bridal party. And a polite request doesn't ever really make someone an AH, since it can be refused just as politely.\n\nBut while you absolutely don't have to have your sister as a bridal attendant, this entire post is you explaining that your reasoning is, essentially, that you resent the hell out of her (and are seemingly determined to exclude and punish her for it) . . . because of *things that other people did, that she had no control over*. Especially as a child. \n\nYou're an AH because your resentment is valid (my sister resented me for years because our parents ignored her when I was extremely ill as a kid, and she felt deeply neglected, so I'm intimately familiar with this dynamic), but you're blaming it on someone who was entirely innocent. Your parents were adults, fully in control of their own choices . . . and they made the choice to focus on her and ignore you. She had nothing to do with that. \n\nAnd it was one thing for you to resent her as a child, when you couldn't comprehend that. But you're an adult now . . . and yet you still view her as the enemy instead of the parents who chose to make you the least of their priorities.\n\nI'm not saying that you have to be best friends, or make her your bridesmaid, but at the very least, you should be seeking therapy to explore why you still blame her for their behaviour.

It is your day. You don't need anyone there who can ruin it.", "NTA\n\nI would tell mom that if she asks again sister will not be invited, and if she asks again after that, she will not be invited.\n\n\nFAFO", "NTA.  \n\nThere is nothing quite as traumatic within a family dynamic as not being treated equally and not being the golden child when you have only one other sibling and they are.  I commiserate entirely.  I\u2019ve been there and it\u2019s left me with a lot of trauma as well.\n\nLeave her out of the wedding party as a bridesmaid and if she or mom says anything reply with \u2018Well I invited you to the ceremony\u2019.  Also she gets a good view and won\u2019t if she\u2019s on bridesmaid duty.  I\u2019m sure you can assign some boring task to her as well to keep her out of your way like flower arranging.\n\nMost of all enjoy your day and congratulations.", "Be blunt about it! NTA", "NTA- tell her the reasons.", "NTA.  You're getting married.  Now is a perfectly appropriate time to tell your mother honestly how you feel about the way you were raised, what the long term consequences of that are for you, and what your fears are for including your sister in your wedding party.  Your mom may say \"oh, that's in the past\", but you shouldn't budge.  Best case scenario is she has a revelation, apologizes and offers helpful insight on her perspective", "Just say \u201cI have already decided who will be in your wedding party, I think it would be inappropriate to change plans and commitments, and I am unwilling to do so.\u201d\n\nIf she says oh this is for her, blah blah blah, just repeat above.  No need to justify or explain.  If she calls you selfish repeat above.", "This is your wedding, not your mother's.  Just tell her that she doesn't get to dictate terms.  No need to go into details.  No is a complete sentence.", "No is a complete sentence", "NTA, but is it really necessary?\n\nYou will only cause drama.\n\nBe strong and straight forward with your mom stating, \"I have chosen my two best friends as part of my wedding party.  I feel it is perfect as is.  <Sister> will be invited, but it doesn't fit my plan to add additional people to the bridal party.\"\n\nIf mom pushes, they explain to her that you want the day to be about you, but just telling her no and no is a complete sentence should, to a normal person, be enough.", "NTA - your parents are the AHs here and you are at a crossroads in life. You're justified in feeling hurt, disappointed and betrayed by both parents, but especially your mom. However, you'll need to figure out how you want to move forward and onward. \n\nYour parents seem completely unaware of how they treated your sister as the golden child compared to ignoring you, has traumatized you. I would recommend talking to a family therapist to help you reconcile your feelings and to help you figure out how to navigate your future relationship with your family. Making your parents aware of how their behavior has effected you might help them and you move towards a better future relationship. Or they may refuse to acknowledge your feelings. But no matter what, you deserve to not have to continue to be made to feel like you're always 2nd best.\n\nThere Tell your mom, that you won't have your sister in your wedding party period. Be clear and tell her never to bring it up to you again. Tell her that it is not okay for her to make your sister her priority on YOUR wedding day. \n\nAsk her if it's really just too hard for her to be a decent mom to you and prioritize you for 1 day of your/her life. \n\nBut honestly, i'd remove my expectations from your parents and focus on you and your hubby rather than give them the power to keep hurting you.", "Nope. NTA. To me, NTA even if there wasn\u2019t history. The MOH traditionally has real responsibilities in helping the bride decide things. That\u2019s why it\u2019s usually done by the closest friend. That\u2019s not your sister.", "NTA - your wedding your rules. \nYou might find it cathartic to tell your mum why", "NTA. Here's a phrase every bride needs to learn, \"thank you for the suggestion, but we're already set with what works for us\" - this can be your standard reply for all of the\"helpful\" suggestions you'll receive while wedding planning.", "The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Do you really want her at your wedding at all? Is it going to create problems with her and her family trying to take over? That would be my concern since we know the backstory.", "DO NOT bring up the examples.  That's just stirring the pot.\n\nTell your mom, \"Mom, this is my and my fianc\u00e9's wedding.  All choices and decisions are ours.  I won't be having anyone other than Sam and Joe standing up for me.  This discussion is closed.  Please don't bring it up again.\"\n\nDeal with the trauma in therapy, not by dredging things up with your mother.\n\nY T A if you bring up the examples.  NTA for not wanting your sister in your bridal party.", "NTA\n\nThe only reason you need is \u201cit\u2019s my wedding\u201d. I went through a somewhat similar situation with my sister, who was in my wife\u2019s party but I didn\u2019t invite her husband, my BIL, to be in mine. For one, our parties were uneven and adding one to my side would have worsened that. Two, the dude is a just a prick and we aren\u2019t close. My sister was upset, but that\u2019s okay with me. \n\nYou aren\u2019t required to make anyone happy on your wedding day but yourself and your spouse. You two are literally all that matter that day.\n\nJust tell her \u201cno, and that is final\u201d and let her take that how she may.", "NTA\n\nYour Mom wants the golden child to be the center of your wedding.", "NTA\n\ngo for it. mom hasn't taken the subtle hints so go for broke and lay it all out. \n\nbottom line it's your day, your choice.", "Bringing up those examples and explaining it like you just did to us is a very good idea.\n\nNTA", "And I would add on that if she continues to bring it up she won't be invited either. I know that probably stings but you know she's going to bring it up at the wedding aswell how it's such a a shame you couldn't be nice to your sister. You don't need that garbage on your wedding day. Tell mom to shape up or ship out.", "Also, OP mentions that her relationship with her sister is now - finally - going reasonably well. This may sound mean or crazy, but NOT having the sister be MOH could help keep it that way. \n\nPutting sister into the wedding party for all the wrong reasons could very swiftly lead to things disintegrating and ruining a relationship and a wedding. \n\nNope.  NTA.", "I agree. No one is going to listen to OP's reasons. All they'll do is wait for OP to finish talking and then tell them why they're wrong about everything. Don't bother.", "Omg this!!!\n\nNTA - and it will always be an argument with people used to bulldozing.\n\n\u2018No.\u2019 *Oh but it would be so nice..* \u2018Mom, the decision is made, I would appreciate not being asked again. The answer will not change.\u2019\n\nThen ignore her! Or only reply \u2018again, the decision is made and will not change.\u2019\n\nAnd though mom isn\u2019t contributing, if she\u2019s helping at all,  I\u2019d minimize that. And ensure all vendors have passwords.", "I wish I had known this term earlier... I spent 5 years taking calls for the police, encouraging people not to argue or explain with problematic people, not because it caused a scene, but because their life is not a debate or compromise. Tell people how it is and end the discussion.", "Thanks for the term.", "All those years of therapy, and today I learned there's a term for that!\n\nNTA, OP. Mom lived your childhood too. If she keeps pushing your repeated \"No,\" she's not going to accept your reasons either. But first you need to say \"NO\" on repeat until you say your vows if need be.", "Thank you for bringing up this term, I will share it with my husband although neither one of us will have to use it a whole lot.  Still, good to learn and incorporate into one\u2019s life!", "I think I prefer \u201creasons are for reasonable people\u201d. Mom is unlikely to be reasonable, thus giving her a reason is a waste of time.", "She is remarried and my mom did have my sister and I as bridesmaids when she was remarried", "We get along now, but we\u2019re certainly not close. Even with the past aside I wouldn\u2019t feel like we are close enough to be in each others weddings.", "I agree the problem is with my parents, but what is petty or insecure about wanting my wedding day to actually be about me and my fianc\u00e9?", "Yes we have for both family drama and cost savings reasons", "I tell my stepson, when he asks thing\u2019s multiple times, \u201casked and answered\u201d!  It really gets the message through that I have already assessed the question, responded and that I will not be bullied into changing my stance on the subject.  He\u2019s 8 and he gets it so hopefully your mom can too (although I know moms who \u201cwant to keep the peace\u201d at your expense!)", "Agreed. OP NTA. This is your special day and the decision as to who has a role in your bridal party lie solely in the hands of you and your fianc\u00e9e. You deserve a day that is joyful, beautiful, memorable and drama free.\n\nIf your Mom keeps badgering you tell her when she plans AND pays for a wedding she becomes the decision maker. I. This case it is your wedding that you are planning and paying for, therefore you are the decision maker. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yup, I agree. Someone who\u2019s trying to horn it on the wedding plans despite not contributibg towards the wedding financially or in the bridal party should not be welcome if they can\u2019t accept things for what they are", "I just tell my friends to stop showing their knickers. When you explain, justify, defend, etc, you are bowing down to the other person, and showing your knickers.\n\nJust stop showing your knickers. That gives them the mental image to understand what they are doing and they start responding pretty quickly. And stop showing their knickers.", "So she got what she wanted.  Now it's time to get what you want.  Your wedding day you are allowed to be a bit selfish.  It should be about you and your soon to be husband.", "Don\u2019t feel the need to explain to her. She either won\u2019t listen, or will give you all sort of justifications, excuses, and gaslighting. \n\nGrey Rock your mother about this.", "That's completely fair :) but still don't blame your sister for how your parents acted. I'm sorry you went through that.", "Because it's already about you and your fiance. Not saying you have to have your sister in your wedding party, you don't (which I why I said NTA). But honestly your reasoning is both laughable and sad. It sounds like your sister literally has open beef with your parents, but you covet your parents attention so much that you're blind to see that they're the ones who turned you against your sister. Grow up.", "It\u2019s supposed to be about us, but as  my post explained I\u2019ve had other issues where days that were supposed to be about me (my grad school graduation day) that were ruined because of my sister. I do not want the opportunity for that to happen at my wedding. I\u2019m also not \u201cturned against\u201d my sister. As the post mentioned we are friendly and cordial now as adults, just not close. We don\u2019t have the best friend relationship that some siblings do have and I do understand that she wasn\u2019t at any fault, that it was my parents. But my parents are still this way. They have not changed in this regard since our childhoods."]}
