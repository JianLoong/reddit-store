Go in knowing what you're going to say & the consequences of whatever you're met with (what you're prepared to do). Ask to speak uninterrupted & don't raise your voice.

You did not argue back to your parents.\n\nFor more than 60 years, Mom was resentful that she did not get to choose her own bridesmaid.\n\nDon't let that happen to you. Don't be still having regrets 60 years later. Stand your ground.\n\nI wouldn't waste my breath explaining why, though. Whenever you present reasons to someone, you just give them ammunition to argue with you. Your mom will say you are exaggerating, or that never happened, or she had good reasons to do what she did, or you're just jealous, or you're being petty for holding a grudge after all this time, or... or... or... \n\nDon't give her a chance to argue back. \"No\" is a complete sentence. \"No, Mom, I am not having Sister as my maid of honor.

YTA.\n\nI was honestly going to say E-S-H, because you certainly aren't required to have anyone in your bridal party that you don't want or aren't close to, including your sister. But while there is an argument to be made for your mother (and father) being an AH in general based on the bulk of your post, from the sound of it she didn't make a fuss and she wasn't pushy. She literally just asked if you'd consider putting your only sister in the bridal party. And a polite request doesn't ever really make someone an AH, since it can be refused just as politely.\n\nBut while you absolutely don't have to have your sister as a bridal attendant, this entire post is you explaining that your reasoning is, essentially, that you resent the hell out of her (and are seemingly determined to exclude and punish her for it) . . . because of *things that other people did, that she had no control over*. Especially as a child. \n\nYou're an AH because your resentment is valid (my sister resented me for years because our parents ignored her when I was extremely ill as a kid, and she felt deeply neglected, so I'm intimately familiar with this dynamic), but you're blaming it on someone who was entirely innocent. Your parents were adults, fully in control of their own choices . . . and they made the choice to focus on her and ignore you. She had nothing to do with that. \n\nAnd it was one thing for you to resent her as a child, when you couldn't comprehend that. But you're an adult now . . . and yet you still view her as the enemy instead of the parents who chose to make you the least of their priorities.\n\nI'm not saying that you have to be best friends, or make her your bridesmaid, but at the very least, you should be seeking therapy to explore why you still blame her for their behaviour. In the meantime, YTA, not for not wanting her as a bridesmaid, but for literally telling the culprit - your mother - that you blame her actions on your sister.", "thats fucked dude..  yta just wna see u grow no judgment :l", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If your mom complains, tell her the decision is made, is final, and is no longer up for discussion.", "NTA, your mom is an enabler and needs to stop", "NTA. And from what you provided about her issues with your father she sounds like an exhausting jerk and your mother has enabled her crap for too long with her being the golden child.", "NTA YOU choose who YOU want in your wedding party. No one else gets to decide that! It's you and your fianc\u00e9's wedding so you 2 are the only ones to make big decisions in the wedding.", "So I totally think you are in the right. First off your bridal party is supposed to be your closest friends be it related or not. Secondly my mom asked me to have my sister in my wedding party too and to this day I regret doing that for her. She made the day all about how helpful she is to be and how I couldn't have done it all without her. She's got all the attention and mind you here is what she did for my wedding. She went with me to my flower appt. Yep that' all she did. I planned the whole thing and executed it myself to the point I was at the reception hall at 6am cooking for my wedding before anyone else even arrived. I was getting my hair done while cooking. Where was my sister? In bed, late almost for the wedding because of it. So please do what makes you happy. It's your day not hers. Do better than I did. No one's opinion of your wedding matters but yours and your husband's.", "NTA!  OP's mom is guiltying her into including her sister.   It's your wedding & your entitled to select whoever you want.", "Nta", "Nta but I fear the day will be about her regardless.  Your mom making it about, can you believe OP didn't have her own sister in the wedding party? Yes I suggest being very blunt with your mom, but also maybe consider eloping.", "NTA especially because of what happened at your graduation. She may have reasons or issues with your father that are very valid however. She could have agreed to be on opposite ends of a picture. I don\u2019t know if you know what the drama is but she could have explained she wasn\u2019t going to be in pictures with your dad ahead of time so y\u2019all weren\u2019t expecting it the day of. \n\nI assume your dad will be walking you down the isle or standing with the wedding party for pictures. For that reason alone she doesn\u2019t need to be in the bridal party. Yore not doing traditional bridesmaids and y\u2019all aren\u2019t close friends.", "Tell her that No is a complete sentence. It is your wedding. You get to choose who is in your bridal party. Btw, great choice with your Men of Honour. And they are still MoH. LOL Is your groom going to share in the spirit and have any women stand up with him?\n\nNTA. If you feel the need to justify your stance, then pick a couple of examples but don't belabour the point. Personally I wouldn't because, imho, it just dilutes your message. You don't want to come across as petty or jealous.", "No examples. Just the word NO.", "NTA! This is yours and your fianc\u00e9\u2019s wedding day, not your mothers! You two make the rules! As such, you don\u2019t have to explain yourself to her.", "NTA.

Tell your mom don\u2019t tell your mom whatever, but somebody needs to tell your mom to quiet down.  It\u2019s your wedding.  I love the idea of your two best male friends standing up for you.  Don\u2019t let your mother guilt you into anything.  Your day, your rules especially since she\u2019s not financially contributing.", "Nta you don't need to explain yourself to anybody not even your mom. It's your wedding, you get to choose whoever you want for your bridal party. But if you do really need to say something you can , you can just say : hey mom I thought of what you suggested but I would like to do this instead and it's already decided  so please drop the topic .", "NTA.

And then let mom explain why she wasn't there.", "No, YWNBTA. In fact, it could be cathartic for you to share how you felt overshadowed growing up.", "NTA. Your wedding should be about you not your mother or your sister.", "NTA just say that\u2019s a really nice suggestion mom, but I like the plans I already have in place for my wedding.", "Your wedding, your choice, NTA", "Um no your mother should be made aware of her errors plus if she refused to be in a photo with him then she's definitely refuse at your wedding and she will somehow make it about her absolutely do not give in to that. I would simply say no bc she refuses to be around dad and if your mother pushes it then tell her everything and unleash on her. It's your wedding why is she fixated on your sister on your day. Yeah that's a no from me.", "NTA- but she will make your wedding about her one way or the other. If she is in the wedding, she will find some issue. If she is not, she will make the reception about that. If Dad is still in the picture, she will probably refuse pictures again. It sounds like Mom will contribute to the drama either way. You can\u2019t win here. Especially if they are both there \n\nYou and your fianc\u00e9 should go away for a weekend somewhere and either elope alone or with your chosen wedding party.", "Just tell your mom:  \n\n\u201cWhat is it about the word \u2018no\u2019 that you do not understand?  It is my wedding and I choose the guests. Bring it up one more time and you will be disinvited.\u201c.  \n\nIf she does bring it up again, follow through.

It is your day and you have every right to feel like a main character and avoid being sidelined.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, however, please consider whether telling the truth is actually the way to go.  You know your mother well, but given the history, there is a possibility telling her the truth will make things worse.  And this will just be unnecessary hassle for you I think it is perfectly fine and effective to say that this is what you planned for your wedding, and that is how it will be full stop.  You will not be changing it to include your sister, and if your mother persists with her harassment, you may just disinvite HER from the wedding. So her choices are to attend and drop this, or continue to push your sister on you and lose the chance to attend. \n\nThis is not to say that you should not be honest with your mother at some point.  But given her nature, how, when, and where you say it likely matters here, especially for the sake of your own sanity.", "NTA.

A. Congrats on your engagement and I wish you a long happy marriage, and B. My fianc\u00e9e and I are getting married in October, and I don't even have my brother in my groomsmen party, and I kinda secretly hope he's not showing up. Luckily my parents get it and are extremely understanding and loving and all that, but if they weren't and tried to insist on having my brother be a part of shit I would instantly go nuclear and say if it's such a big deal for you then y'all can stay home. Cause it's my fianc\u00e9e's and I 's wedding. We only want to celebrate with the people we love and care about and who we want to celebrate with. That's it. No one else get's to decide who or who does not come, or what roel they have. I'm fine with inviting my brother, that's fine, but every person in my party, especially especially my best man, has been more of a brother to me than my blood relative has ever been so yeah if anyone tried to give me any gas (luckily no one has) then I would've told them to fuck right off", "Tell your mom that you will not be having your sister in the wedding and if she (mom) intends to try and make your wedding about your sister like she did your whole childhood that you won\u2019t even invite the sister.

After the wedding I\u2019d seek some therapy to work thru childhood things. You haven\u2019t said anything about her as an adult. Thank god we all aren\u2019t judged by how we were as teens. Life is more nuanced than black and white.", "And Dad will cry somewhere? Tbh it sounds like they all have issues", "You wnbta regardless, but in light of this information, it sounds like the situation is more in the vein of, \"I can choose my dad or my sister but not both\". Your sister sounds like she was a nightmare teenager, and I don't know if she's changed since then, but I would still choose my dad over her given these circumstances. Ideally, nobody would ever have to make such a decision, but this is the reality.\n\n\"No\" it's a complete sentence. No need to justify it."]}
