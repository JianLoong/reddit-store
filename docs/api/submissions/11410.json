When OP takes his kids on vaycay, the ex doesn't need to \"plan\" anything, other than the fact that the kids will be on vaycay.

This is the most satisfying post I\u2019ve read in a while on this sub. Bravo. F that shit. Also she\u2019s depriving her kids of meaningful and diverse experiences just for her own selfish and malicious Gotcha moment. What\u2019s in the best interest of the kids is that they have a mom who places their need and interests and happiness at the forefront, not a mom who can\u2019t let go of her past.", "NTA I was gonna say you were because she deserves to know where where the kids are, but you DO let her know where the kids are and more. You're golden.", "Nah, as long as you eventually tell her where they'll be. My BILs ex did something similar after their divorce. We went with then to the beach in Maine for a few days, and the kids didn't even get to relax/stay at home once they got back from that trip because their Mom also took them to the beach. I am sure the 2nd trip wasn't that much fun as they were wiped and just wanted to relax at home for a bit. \n\nI understand as a parent, I wouldn't want to miss out on special things with my kids. But, it's lame to have identical trips. It not only messes with the other parent if they have to \"compete\" with an identical trip the other parent did, but it makes it less special and memorable for the kids. At the end of the day - I'd want them to enjoy their vacations and trips with both of us and make sure they have happy memories with each parent. \n\nIf your ex wanted to know your plans so she could plan something DIFFERENT, then that's fair. But to know just to plan identical trips is lame af.
