But you then explained that you indeed do give her all the necessary info. She doesn\u2019t need that in advance so you are good.", "NTA. It's not that you're not telling her where you're taking the kids, you're just not giving her a ton of advanced notice. I don't see how it should matter to her to know months beforehand where you're taking them (other than the obvious fact that she wants to one-up you). What's important is that, while they're on the trip, she's fully aware of where her children are and how to contact you all in case of an emergency", "NTA. Your ex was intentionally sabotaging your time with your children. Now she is mad that she cannot do it.", "NTA. I was ready to say you were bc the headline said not tell my ex. But yeah you gave the info and even more than I would expect with hotel phone numbers and everything. I think it\u2019s amazing.", "My ex is pissed at me for not telling her what I'm doing so she can plan accordingly.\n\nThis is it right here.  When OP takes his kids on vaycay, the ex doesn't need to \"plan\" anything, other than the fact that the kids will be on vaycay.  With her saying \"...so she can plan accordingly\", she's admitting that she wants to know what the plans are so she can try to one-up OP.  She's the AH.  Enjoy your vaycays with the kids!!!", "I\u2019m surprising myself- NTA. Your detailed itinerary the day of with numbers etc. saves you here. You could consider emailing it the week before, it would help pack- I would have a hard time with the vague directions but that\u2019s \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. It sounds like you put a lot of time and thought into your vacations and consider your kids interests, that\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s not cool of her to take your efforts and beat you to it.", "NTA, as long as she knows where they are whenever they are there.\n\nYou should still be open to dicussing both your plans with each other beforehand. The adult thing to do would be for you to both be able to plan different activities and vacations. Her past behaviour gets in the way of that of course, but I would not close it off completely. (It's unclear whether she knew you were going to the Midwest last summer and took them to Disney again, or whether she took them there because she thought you were doing something like that.)", "NTA. This is the most satisfying post I\u2019ve read in a while on this sub. Bravo. F that shit. Also she\u2019s depriving her kids of meaningful and diverse experiences just for her own selfish and malicious Gotcha moment. What\u2019s in the best interest of the kids is that they have a mom who places their need and interests and happiness at the forefront, not a mom who can\u2019t let go of her past.", "NTA I was gonna say you were because she deserves to know where where the kids are, but you DO let her know where the kids are and more. You're golden.", "Nah, as long as you eventually tell her where they'll be. My BILs ex did something similar after their divorce. We went with then to the beach in Maine for a few days, and the kids didn't even get to relax/stay at home once they got back from that trip because their Mom also took them to the beach. I am sure the 2nd trip wasn't that much fun as they were wiped and just wanted to relax at home for a bit. \n\nI understand as a parent, I wouldn't want to miss out on special things with my kids. But, it's lame to have identical trips. It not only messes with the other parent if they have to \"compete\" with an identical trip the other parent did, but it makes it less special and memorable for the kids. At the end of the day - I'd want them to enjoy their vacations and trips with both of us and make sure they have happy memories with each parent. \n\nIf your ex wanted to know your plans so she could plan something DIFFERENT, then that's fair. But to know just to plan identical trips is lame af. Also, if she wants to know your trips in advance - why isn't she extending you the same courtesy?", "NTA\n\nShe knows exactly what she is doing", "NTA. She is lucky you are giving her any information. It is your time with your kids and not her business. All she needs is your cell number for emergencies. You sound like a great dad and your kids are old enough to see the kinds of games their mother is playing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
