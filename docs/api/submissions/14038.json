{"id": 14038, "submission_id": "12cbimi", "title": "AITA for telling my sister she's being unfair to her older children?", "selftext": "My sister has been married twice. Her first husband died and she has Calla (14f) and Griffin (12m) with him. She has Luke (4m) and Anna (2f) with her current husband. My sister's current husband is Jeremy and from the time he got engaged to my sister he called Calla and Griffin his children and has introduced himself to people as their dad. I know this has bothered both Calla and Griffin and the four (Calla, Griffin, my sister and BIL) were in family therapy for close to two years to make things smoother. I believe my sister also hoped that with family therapy, my niece and nephew would be okay with Jeremy taking on the role as their dad and would not feel like it was a bad thing for him to be considered both an equal parent and a dad for them. This did not work out that way but reluctantly, with the advice of the therapist, Jeremy stopped saying they were his kids and he was their dad. He used step in front of kids and dad. Which Calla and Griffin were fine with.\n\nNow in the present day there has been somewhat of a fallout after Calla wrote about her family and spoke a lot about her dad and brother and mentioned that her and her brother might be closer today because they share the loss of her dad. She talked about when she gets married one day she'd like Griffin to be the one who walks her down the aisle and for them to dance to honor her dad. She mentioned how she only has one dad and while she has a stepdad, for her, those are not the same. I don't know all the rest of the details but these points, when read by my sister and BIL, made them angry. Both had a very negative reaction to her only having one dad. They say it is dismissive of Jeremy and downplays the role he has in the family and all he has done for her. But also the fact where Griffin would do the typical father of the bride stuff for her one day over Jeremy is completely wrong and shows a lack of care for Jeremy.\n\nThey sat Calla down over this. Told her how disrespectful she was to Jeremy by saying she only had one dad and clearly stating it's not him. Griffin was around and said it was true though and he feels the same way. Both the kids were given punishments for this. They were told they don't get to enjoy cell phones and computers if they disrespect one of the people who allows them to have those things. They are also being forced to spend more time with Jeremy without anyone else around, doing whatever he wants to do.\n\nMy sister told me all this and I told her she was being unfair to her children. I told her she might not like it but it's not so uncommon for kids to view stepparents differently from bio parents. She told me it might not be uncommon but as a mom now she realizes how selfish those kids are and realizes her own friends who felt that way were wrong. She told me I know nothing about parenting children in a blended family so I should mind my own business and stop interfering.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680678016, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12cbimi/aita_for_telling_my_sister_shes_being_unfair_to/", "score": 266, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Of all the people I have known with stepparents, only one was okay with the stepparent being called their mom/dad. And that was just they weren't bothered by it.

I do understand why it might seem like the best suggestion but I do not believe for one second it will be beneficial. The only reason they seem to have reluctantly agreed to do what the first therapist suggested is because she mentioned the kids might start to call him dad or be okay with him being called their dad if they felt listened to and respected.

I don't understand how a parent could think it's ok to force their kids to replace their other parent with their spouse. Some kids see their step parents as a parent and that fine. Some kids only view their bio parents as parents, which is perfectly fine too. They aren't disrespecting him by saying he isn't their dad because he isn't. They accept him as their stepdad because that's what he is. He may be a father figure in their life, but he's not their dad.
