{"id": 14038, "submission_id": "12cbimi", "title": "AITA for telling my sister she's being unfair to her older children?", "selftext": "My sister has been married twice. Her first husband died and she has Calla (14f) and Griffin (12m) with him. She has Luke (4m) and Anna (2f) with her current husband. My sister's current husband is Jeremy and from the time he got engaged to my sister he called Calla and Griffin his children and has introduced himself to people as their dad. I know this has bothered both Calla and Griffin and the four (Calla, Griffin, my sister and BIL) were in family therapy for close to two years to make things smoother. I believe my sister also hoped that with family therapy, my niece and nephew would be okay with Jeremy taking on the role as their dad and would not feel like it was a bad thing for him to be considered both an equal parent and a dad for them. This did not work out that way but reluctantly, with the advice of the therapist, Jeremy stopped saying they were his kids and he was their dad. He used step in front of kids and dad. Which Calla and Griffin were fine with.\n\nNow in the present day there has been somewhat of a fallout after Calla wrote about her family and spoke a lot about her dad and brother and mentioned that her and her brother might be closer today because they share the loss of her dad. She talked about when she gets married one day she'd like Griffin to be the one who walks her down the aisle and for them to dance to honor her dad. She mentioned how she only has one dad and while she has a stepdad, for her, those are not the same. I don't know all the rest of the details but these points, when read by my sister and BIL, made them angry. Both had a very negative reaction to her only having one dad. They say it is dismissive of Jeremy and downplays the role he has in the family and all he has done for her. But also the fact where Griffin would do the typical father of the bride stuff for her one day over Jeremy is completely wrong and shows a lack of care for Jeremy.\n\nThey sat Calla down over this. Told her how disrespectful she was to Jeremy by saying she only had one dad and clearly stating it's not him. Griffin was around and said it was true though and he feels the same way. Both the kids were given punishments for this. They were told they don't get to enjoy cell phones and computers if they disrespect one of the people who allows them to have those things. They are also being forced to spend more time with Jeremy without anyone else around, doing whatever he wants to do.\n\nMy sister told me all this and I told her she was being unfair to her children. I told her she might not like it but it's not so uncommon for kids to view stepparents differently from bio parents. She told me it might not be uncommon but as a mom now she realizes how selfish those kids are and realizes her own friends who felt that way were wrong. She told me I know nothing about parenting children in a blended family so I should mind my own business and stop interfering.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680678016, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12cbimi/aita_for_telling_my_sister_shes_being_unfair_to/", "score": 428, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Of all the people I have known with stepparents, only one was okay with the stepparent being called their mom/dad. And that was just they weren't bothered by it. They didn't agree with it themselves exactly. I know there are many who are okay with it, none that I personally know, but it all comes down to factors you can't always control.", "It's okay! I do understand why it might seem like the best suggestion but I do not believe for one second it will be beneficial. The only reason they seem to have reluctantly agreed to do what the first therapist suggested is because she mentioned the kids might start to call him dad or be okay with him being called their dad if they felt listened to and respected.

I don't understand how a parent could think it's ok to force their kids to replace their other parent with their spouse. Some kids see their step parents as a parent and that fine. Some kids only view their bio parents as parents, which is perfectly fine too. They aren't disrespecting him by saying he isn't their dad because he isn't. They accept him as their stepdad because that's what he is. He may be a father figure in their life, but he's not their dad.

It\u2019s true for platonic relationships the same as romantic ones.\n\nAn adult being nice and supportive to a child in their life doesn\u2019t make them their mom or dad. \n\nJeremy has a responsibility to the kids because he\u2019s an adult who chose to marry their mom. The kids do not have that same responsibility to him. They have the general responsibility to treat Jeremy with basic human decency and politeness, but that\u2019s it. Refusing to call him dad or view them as their dad isn\u2019t a matter of respect. It\u2019s not a title given to someone out of respect.\n\nAll your sister is doing is communicating to her kids that her and Jeremy\u2019s fantasy of a blended family is more important to them. Yes, blended families are tough. But steamrolling children by punishing them for not loving your new spouse the way you want them to and forcing them to spend time with him without anyone else around (isolating them) isn\u2019t the answer.\n\nThey are going to be the cause of a lot of resentment.\n\nIf I were you I\u2019d be prepared for the possibility that the kids will want to bail right at 18, and might need a place to land.\n\nYou can\u2019t make people you want to fuck be interested in you, you can\u2019t make people be in a romantic relationship, you can\u2019t force people to be best friends, and you can\u2019t force them to love someone like their deceased parent. Hell, biological parents can\u2019t force their kids to love them more than another parental figure in their life.\n\nPunishing a kid because someone isn\u2019t their favorite person is an asshole thing to do.", "NTA. Your niblings are going to want to live with you in the near future. Be prepared. Your sister is being myopic on this, and she will lose the love and respect of her children. Jeremy has lost any chance of it.", "NTA-your reply should of been and you know nothing of being a child who lost their parent.", "NTA\nIt is not bad to advocate for respecting the children\u2019s feelings. Your sister can choose to ignore you but you weren\u2019t an asshole for just saying you thought she was wrong this time.\n\nIt was probably hurtful to not be viewed as their dad but you can\u2019t force a feeling.  This is a 14 year old and 12 year old talking. They might feel differently in their 20\u2019s.  They should go back to therapy and work sincerely if they want to better the relationships. Maybe this is as good as it gets for them. Maybe Jeremy has to accept that he is not a dad to those kids.", "NTA. Forcing her kids to accept their step parent as their father and forcing that relationship is just going to make it worse. At this point, she'll be lucky to be invited to their weddings.", "NTA I am astep parent with a great relationship with my stepchild.  The one thing I never did was push the relationship, I never tried to be a replacement, I never stood on anyone's toes, I never push myself into thier lives I just was a good person to them and let them develop a relationship with me at thier pace.  I now get mothers day gifts every year, they don't use step unless trying to explain the full family dynamic, they invite me to stuff, all because they set the pace.  You push the relationship it doesn't happen!", "I love when people do this - tell u their problems, give their opinion and then say u should mind ur own business and tell u that u arnt qualified to comment if u do anything other than passionately agree with u. \n\nNTA", "NTA. They get to decide how they feel about people. Punishing them for not liking Jeremy is not going to make them like him more. Sister and Jeremy are heading the right way to have no contact with the older kids if they keep pushing this.", "NTA.  Apparently your sister has neglected to consider the fact she has no idea what its like to grow up as a child of a blended family...she doesn't get to dictate how her children feel.  She can help foster an environment for love, growth and acceptance, but she cannot force or demand it...after all her children posses their own experience and autonomy.", "> However, if I were Jeremy, I, too, would be polite and kind to Calla and Griffin, nothing more.\n\nI would argue that as an adult choosing to marry someone with kids, Jeremy has a responsibility here that the kids don\u2019t.", "If she keeps this behavior up they might start saying they don\u2019t have a mom either.\nNTA", "NTA", "Your sister is going to destroy these kids lives. They clearly are uncomfortable with Jeremy. The fact that they are forcing a relationship is going to push them away much faster than they already were. THey are never going to forget being forced to \"like\" someone or spend time with someone just because they don't want to call him dad or make the world think he is their dad. He isn't. He may provide support to them but that wasn't their decision. Therapy is only going to be the beginning.", "NTA\n\nYou're telling her the truth. The more they push, the more the children will resent both of them. Punishing them for not wanting to erase their father is just so wrong. It would not surprise me if they left at the earliest legal opportunity and cut both their mom and stepdad out of their lives. \n\nI'm glad they have you, and I hope that line of communication stays open, for their sakes.", "NTA.  You\u2019ve said your piece, but unfortunately you have no control over this situation.  The best you can do is let the kids know you support them and then be there to pick up the pieces when they go NC with your sister later on.  \n\nIf you think you might get somewhere, you could repeat your viewpoint to your sister periodically, but I suspect it will be like talking to a brick wall.", "NTA. Your sister and her husband are abusive. Jeremy isn't their father and they need therapy themselves for still trying to force those poor kids to accept a replacement for their father at the expense of electronics and to be forced to spend time with him.\n\nYour sister is a piece of work and no doubt quit therapy when the therapist didn't form her children to the image she wanted.", "NTA. While parents can choose other spouses, they don't get to pick who their children define as a father/mother.  Period.  Their stepdad can be a perfectly nice human being and STILL not be considered their dad and they have a right to their feelings.  Your sister punishing them for these feelings is only going to make them worse and she can look forward to a lot of distance from her older children when they move out.  This is the kind of thing that creates canyons of distance between parents and their children for decades.", "See this one is weird... normally in these constant \"Overbearing stepparents\" AITA it's more of a question of \"how much does the kid really feel like new stepparent is the parent.\"\n\nBut in this case this is a WAY pre-marriage girl specifically planning how she will never ever include stepdad in the wedding.\n\nThe normal one is obviously important in how the child/stepparent relationship works.  This one would appear to be a kid stating how she actively detests her stepfather and has absolutely ruled out him having any kind of paternal role in this event which will be years away if not never.\n\nYou're NTA.  This is actually pretty worrying.  \"I basically view him as my mom's husband and not my dad\" is not the same as \"I need to lock down the fact that this guy is NOT my dad.\"", "Search. Reddit's AITA, there are so many posts and none of them end well when parents force children to deny their bio relationship and \"embrace\" stepparent.", "NTA. And she has the gall to call her children selfish. I'm sorry for your niece and nephew, but I'm glad at least some of their family (op) are supportive of their feelings.", "NTA at all. I\u2019m happy you\u2019re standing up for them.\n\nKids have a lot of different reactions to losing a parent or gaining a step parent. These kids are responding normally, and your sister and Jeremy are being selfish. I imagine they would have a much closer parent child relationship if their feelings had been respected.", "NTA. they have a right to what they feel and trying to force them to think otherwise is stupid and cruel. It will just lead to long-term resentment. There are so many stories like this on the forums. Find a few and show them to your sister and BIL#2.", "Nta. My dad passed when I was young and my stepdad was just my stepdad. When I got married, I walked myself down the aisle, my brother was uncomfortable taking on that role as he was freshly in a wheelchair and didn\u2019t want the added attention, which I understood.", "There's no guarantee they'd warm up to it and now they've guaranteed the kids go no contact at earliest opportunity", "I'm concerned that they're forced to spend time with him doing whatever he wants. That sounds really icky.", "I said Jeremy should continue to be kind and polite.\n\nI said punishments are uncalled for.\n\nI said Jeremy should focus on, invest in his own children in all ways.\n\nI think Jeremy should step back.  \n\nThese are not his children, nor do they wish to be.\n\nPerhaps Calla and Griffin might come to feel differently in time but not to force it.\n\nJeremy's responsibility as a person married to the mother of Calla and Griffin is to remain kind, polite, and civil at all times providing a safe home environment.  \n\nHe does not need to invest his heart and emotions in children who do not wish him to be involved in their lives.\n\nJeremy owes Calla and Griffin nothing more. \n\nAnd nothing less.", "If it were me I\u2019d ask my sister \n\n\u201cDo you really want to keep telling your children that they are such a burden, they owe Jeremy this \u201crespect\u201d?\u201d", "Funny they want respect while disrespectful of her kids.", "I can't stand these parents that insist on stepparents being referred to as bio parents and trying to erase bio parents. If your sister's first husband was still alive and they had just gotten divorced, chances are, your sister and Jeremy would show him the respect and decency of not trying to cover up his existence and replace him. So why does him being dead negate the need for that respect?!?! I don't get it. And that's not even getting into all the damage they're doing to these kids.", "-\u2018Although he wasn\u2019t interested in having kids, he grew very fond of us and accepted us as his kids.\u2019\n\nI\u2019m sure your dad didn\u2019t do this deliberately, but it\u2019s perfect reverse psychology. \n\nOP\u2019s BIL - \u2018I demand that you see me as your dad!

Kids - \u2018oh please please, you are so great, we would be so happy, please be our dad!\u2019", "It really is! That\u2019s cute how you did that but absolutely true. And it\u2019s too bad more stepparents don\u2019t do this. There would be much different results. It\u2019s funny because they never married but he took care of her before she died like they were. He\u2019s dad to two girls, grandpa to 4 girls and 1 boy, and great grandpa to 3 girls 1 boy and 1 boy on the way. The grandkids know he\u2019s not biological but the great grandkids are too young to understand it. He\u2019s really not fond of kids but grandkids are different. He\u2019s the same doting grandpa as any.", "This is what happened after my mom died. I am the baby and my two sisters and I became incredibly close. My dad remarried to the exact opposite of my mom. My mom was a responsible well tempered flower child who was very loving. The step mom was a chain smoker and someone who only cared about monetary appearances. Never talked about anything else. They tried to force her down our throats. She accused us of not respecting our father an the like. Has said nasty things about us and telling everyone who would listen how ungrateful we were. Mind you were were 18, 22, and 26 at the time. We invited her to every family event and still do to this day. She hasn't come in 3-4 years. My dad accepted it awhile ago that we weren't going to warm to her and doesn't try the fight anymore. His actions, or lack thereof, in the immediate aftermath while still dealing with my mom's death has basically destroyed my relationship with my father. I still see him here and there and at family events. I just avoid him and exchange pleasantries. I don't hate him. I've forgiven and moved on. I just lost that relationship and despite many efforts to work through, never saw my interest reciprocated privately (he asked my sisters why i hated him but would never ask me). They always told him he had to ask me. To this day, he still has never asked me. I have no doubt that he knows exactly what I'd say and he accepted that too and just lives with it.", "Siblings in difficult family situations often seem to form an especially strong bond."]}
