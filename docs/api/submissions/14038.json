{"id": 14038, "submission_id": "12cbimi", "title": "AITA for telling my sister she's being unfair to her older children?", "selftext": "My sister has been married twice. Her first husband died and she has Calla (14f) and Griffin (12m) with him. She has Luke (4m) and Anna (2f) with her current husband. My sister's current husband is Jeremy and from the time he got engaged to my sister he called Calla and Griffin his children and has introduced himself to people as their dad. I know this has bothered both Calla and Griffin and the four (Calla, Griffin, my sister and BIL) were in family therapy for close to two years to make things smoother. I believe my sister also hoped that with family therapy, my niece and nephew would be okay with Jeremy taking on the role as their dad and would not feel like it was a bad thing for him to be considered both an equal parent and a dad for them. This did not work out that way but reluctantly, with the advice of the therapist, Jeremy stopped saying they were his kids and he was their dad. He used step in front of kids and dad. Which Calla and Griffin were fine with.\n\nNow in the present day there has been somewhat of a fallout after Calla wrote about her family and spoke a lot about her dad and brother and mentioned that her and her brother might be closer today because they share the loss of her dad. She talked about when she gets married one day she'd like Griffin to be the one who walks her down the aisle and for them to dance to honor her dad. She mentioned how she only has one dad and while she has a stepdad, for her, those are not the same. I don't know all the rest of the details but these points, when read by my sister and BIL, made them angry. Both had a very negative reaction to her only having one dad. They say it is dismissive of Jeremy and downplays the role he has in the family and all he has done for her. But also the fact where Griffin would do the typical father of the bride stuff for her one day over Jeremy is completely wrong and shows a lack of care for Jeremy.\n\nThey sat Calla down over this. Told her how disrespectful she was to Jeremy by saying she only had one dad and clearly stating it's not him. Griffin was around and said it was true though and he feels the same way. Both the kids were given punishments for this. They were told they don't get to enjoy cell phones and computers if they disrespect one of the people who allows them to have those things. They are also being forced to spend more time with Jeremy without anyone else around, doing whatever he wants to do.\n\nMy sister told me all this and I told her she was being unfair to her children. I told her she might not like it but it's not so uncommon for kids to view stepparents differently from bio parents. She told me it might not be uncommon but as a mom now she realizes how selfish those kids are and realizes her own friends who felt that way were wrong. She told me I know nothing about parenting children in a blended family so I should mind my own business and stop interfering.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680678016, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12cbimi/aita_for_telling_my_sister_shes_being_unfair_to/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Forcing relationships doesn't work", "NTA. But your sister & BIL are working very hard to make sure the children resent both of them & multiplying any distrust exponentially.  Any chance you could nudge them toward returning to family counseling?", "Nta. I had a step dad for ten years and I truly loved him. Yet he never expected me to call him dad. I always called him by his name and he didn't care. He has been my father when my real father couldn't be. And that's all that mattered to me.\n\nBut no one can force someone else to call them something they don't feel.", "NTA, soon your sister will find out that her two elder kids are going to go nc or lc with her. Too late for regrets then.", "NTA and maybe check in with your nieces because this Jeremy dude looks like a red flag to me", "NTA. With that attitude your sister is making sure to drive the kids away from her.", "Of course you are NTA, thank you so much for standing up for your niece and nephew. Jeremy and your sister obviously didn't take anything from family therapy and if they continue with this behavior and punishment for the (step-)kids personal boundaries they most likely won't be a part of any milestone in their lifes at all. This is how you nourish resentment and disrespect, love or respect are not taught by punishment.", "NTA she is going to be in for a rude awakening when those kids leave at 18 and never come back.", "NTA.", "NTA she told you the story, which gives you room to comment on it. Sounds like they're still trying to force Jeremy onto the kids as their father, which will probably only have an adverse effect. Good for you for sticking up for the kids", "NTA. So your sister and her husband are punishing her two older children because of their feelings???   \n\nYou can\u2019t help how you FEEL!  Punishing someone for their feelings is going to lead to resentment of both stepdad AND mom - and will not change their feelings towards stepdad.", "NTA - your Sister and Brother-in-law need to get their heads out of their a##es.  They are doing nothing but pushing those children away and they will grow to resent them even more.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with their feelings and now with the actions of the Sister and BIL they will bottle them up and result in God knows what kind of mental issues.", "NTA you are great for sticking up for the kids, and Calla writings and Griffins words were correct they only have one dad. As far as I\u2019m reading there was no adoption done , it doesn\u2019t seem as tho the kids would go for it anyway. No matter how her mom and her husband try to imply and forcefully make this happen, all he is is their moms husband he is not related to them. All they are doing is driving the kids away to never return when they turn 18.", "Your sister's kids will grow to hate her.", "NTA, but please provide a safe place for them to be honest and vent their feelings as well as a safe place to land if something goes wrong.", "NTA but do not be surprised when after Calla and Griffin both move out they are low or no contact with their mother and stepdad. Please don't give her this warning because she'll see it as interference and you being negative and no idea what you're talking about because you're not a parent.", "I don't think you are the asshole, but I don't think your sister is either. The two kids are processing this complex situation, and not in a perfect way. This is probably causing a lot of tension in the parent's relationship. Dude wants to take over the father role, right? My guess is this attempt seems like it is erasing their memory of their bio father in some capacity. This is a minefield. Everyone should give each other a break. Your sister shouldn't have made such a big deal of this statement. She is a 14 year old.   \n\n\nDude is a stepdad it is going to be difficult. Here is what I suggest you do. Rephrase your concerns. i.e. \"I don't think you should punish your older children for vocalizing their emotions, but I'm not telling you how to handle this situation. I don't think anyone has a manual for this.\" No one wants to be told how to raise their children.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Her children might love her husband, but in order to do that they don't have to see him a their dad, and they trying to enforce that will just guarantee that they lose both. \nJust because your sister moved on and found a new husband, doesn't mean her children have to do the same", "NTA your sister sure is! She has no right to push her husband on her kids. They only have 1 dad and he has passed.", "How old were the older two when their father died?\n\nHow long after their father died did the mother marry Jeremy? \n\nWhat do the children feel? About everything. How do they view Jeremy (like if him calling them his kids wasn't a thing) like, is he a friendly guy, is he generally a reliable and decent person?\n\nWas it literally right from the get-go that he did that? Or how long after he met the kids?", "NTA- They are going to grow up to resent your sister if she continues to push this. Be there for them because there aren\u2019t many people who have their best interest at heart.", "That was the point the therapist had too regarding him saying they were his kids and introducing himself as their dad. My sister and Jeremy were not too thrilled about that being brought up to them. Though I think Jeremy may have latched on too hard to the idea they might warm up to the idea over time if not pushed. He seems to have taken it at face value that they would be okay with it eventually.", "They have already done family counseling and it feels like they only heard what they wanted to hear, so even if I felt I could, I do not think it would help them at all.", "Yeah, this is the fastest way to not get to talk to your kids for the rest of your life. All because some guys ego can't handle the word step.", "We have spoken and there's nothing else going on.", "There is absolutely no way the kids would have ever been on board with an adoption. I think Jeremy would have loved if it had been something they would consider. But it's 100% not something I see for their future.", "Their dad died 6 years ago and my sister remarried 14 months later. Jeremy was calling them his kids from pretty much the time they got engaged. They seem to view Jeremy as okay but don't appear super close to him.", "Yeah, he should learn to accept they might never be okay with him being \"dad\" (especially if he tries to force it on them). My entire relationship with my stepfather we were on a first name basis, but I considered being okay with calling him \"uncle\", but it never stuck (where I live it's common to call adult family friends aunts and uncles even when there's no blood relation)", "Sorry, I didn't edit \"return to counseling\" soon enough.  It's an ugly situation & it's good that the kids at least have a supportive safe place in you. That may be all you can do.", "He should, as should my sister, but I do not think they are interested in learning that. They want what they want and feel their want is right and shows respect. Of all the people I have known with stepparents, only one was okay with the stepparent being called their mom/dad. And that was just they weren't bothered by it. They didn't agree with it themselves exactly. I know there are many who are okay with it, none that I personally know, but it all comes down to factors you can't always control.", "It's okay! I do understand why it might seem like the best suggestion but I do not believe for one second it will be beneficial. The only reason they seem to have reluctantly agreed to do what the first therapist suggested is because she mentioned the kids might start to call him dad or be okay with him being called their dad if they felt listened to and respected. But I honestly believe they heard that and took it as 100% we do what they say and we'll get what we want eventually.", "Honestly, the fact that a teen sister even likes her brother enough to consider him walking her down the aisle is just about parade-worthy.", "They are very close and I do sometimes question if she's right about them being closer due to the loss of their dad. It makes sense to me given how young they were and then how quickly my sister found love again. And that's not to judge her. But I also know friends of mine suggested it was harder when their parents remarried quicker when they were kids. So if they both felt that and on top of losing their dad. I could easily see a stronger bond forming from that.", "Or they could just be awesome kids. The saddest part would be if their mother completely ignores that.", "With the mother and step father's attitude, it's become Calla and Griffin against the world. \n\nThe (step)parents brought this on themselves. \n\nNTA op, continue being a great space for these kids.", "They are definitely awesome kids. Were always good kids. Though my sister and BIL would certainly disagree with that.", "Ugh. Mine were great kids too. That didn't stop them from occasionally yelling at each other that I should've eaten one at birth, or adopted one from the pound, pretty normal stuff & they laugh about it as adults now."]}
