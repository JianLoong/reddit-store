Totally appropriate on the surface and with a double meaning on the other side to see if the students are paying attention, and wrapped within it is a lesson - you could be the best and brightest, but you are out here making a fool of yourselves.", "NTA. Good teachers tease their students some, in my mind, and what you said was silly and obviously a joke. Don't worry about hurting their feelings, they'll be more then fine.", "NTA for reasons already stated by other commenters, but also, how does SIL know you hurt someone else\u2019s feelings? Being offended on someone else\u2019s behalf isn\u2019t a good look.", "INFO:\nWhy does your SIL think their feelings were hurt? Was it based on something she saw in the kids\u2019 reactions or just how she felt about the joke in general?\n\nMy son graduated high school last year and could easily have been one of those kids.  I think he would have found the joke hilarious and would likely have come home and told us about it. My observation of his peers is that they are generally quite attuned to sarcasm and self-mockery and enjoy it. \n\nSo, it seems very possible to me that your SIL is just projecting or being overly sensitive herself and you\u2019ve got nothing to worry about. But it\u2019s also possible she saw something in the kids\u2019 reactions that you missed and that one or some of them took it to heart. You probably know your SIL and the kids well enough to know which is more likely.", "NTA. \n\nYou know these kids, you have built a rapport with these kids. SIL doesn\u2019t know them or anything about them. Is SIL always so sensitive?", "Kids act goofy sometimes. And really smart kids act as goofy as any other kids, frankly. It doesn't even sound like you were being smug about them. So, NTA. (We acted goofy when I was in high school too. Thank goodness it didn't occur to us to avail ourselves of the Target shopping race carts.)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Usually would happen after someone got their license and they\u2019d be getting ready for a sleepover or study sesh or working on a project. Either way, teenagers are still kids, nothing wrong with that and you technically were telling the truth about them. Any teacher who can actually joke with their students the right way is a good teacher. It shows how much they trust and respect the teacher. NTA", "NTA. They obviously have no idea about the banter that happens between a teacher who has a good rapport with their students. These are bright kids and they will understand what you meant. They don\u2019t need to be talked to as if they\u2019re made of glass. I think you handled the situation perfectly.", "NTA.  If you're at all concerned, I'd suggest just asking your students if it bothered them at all, and saying you're sorry if it did.", "NTA. This is exactly what I'd have expected from my teachers back in the day."]}
