Totally appropriate on the surface and with a double meaning on the other side to see if the students are paying attention, and wrapped within it is a lesson - you could be the best and brightest, but you are out here making a fool of yourselves.", "NTA. Good teachers tease their students some, in my mind, and what you said was silly and obviously a joke. Don't worry about hurting their feelings, they'll be more then fine.", "NTA for reasons already stated by other commenters, but also, how does SIL know you hurt someone else\u2019s feelings? Being offended on someone else\u2019s behalf isn\u2019t a good look.", "INFO:\nWhy does your SIL think their feelings were hurt? Was it based on something she saw in the kids\u2019 reactions or just how she felt about the joke in general?\n\nMy son graduated high school last year and could easily have been one of those kids.  I think he would have found the joke hilarious and would likely have come home and told us about it. My observation of his peers is that they are generally quite attuned to sarcasm and self-mockery and enjoy it. \n\nSo, it seems very possible to me that your SIL is just projecting or being overly sensitive herself and you\u2019ve got nothing to worry about. But it\u2019s also possible she saw something in the kids\u2019 reactions that you missed and that one or some of them took it to heart. You probably know your SIL and the kids well enough to know which is more likely.", "NTA. \n\nYou know these kids, you have built a rapport with these kids. SIL doesn\u2019t know them or anything about them. Is SIL always so sensitive?", "Kids act goofy sometimes. And really smart kids act as goofy as any other kids, frankly. It doesn't even sound like you were being smug about them. So, NTA. (We acted goofy when I was in high school too. Thank goodness it didn't occur to us to avail ourselves of the Target shopping race carts.)", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Usually would happen after someone got their license and they\u2019d be getting ready for a sleepover or study sesh or working on a project. Either way, teenagers are still kids, nothing wrong with that and you technically were telling the truth about them. Any teacher who can actually joke with their students the right way is a good teacher. It shows how much they trust and respect the teacher. NTA", "NTA. They obviously have no idea about the banter that happens between a teacher who has a good rapport with their students. These are bright kids and they will understand what you meant. They don\u2019t need to be talked to as if they\u2019re made of glass. I think you handled the situation perfectly.", "NTA.  If you're at all concerned, I'd suggest just asking your students if it bothered them at all, and saying you're sorry if it did.", "NTA. This is exactly what I'd have expected from my teachers back in the day.", "NTA if the kids are cool with the joke then there's no harm done, I loved the teachers that would be a bit more human with you", "NTA, I wish more of my teachers had been like you!", "NTA\n\nTell your SIL they\u2019re your Sweathogs and she can \u201cstick it up her nose with a rubber hose,\u201d then start humming the theme song from Welcome Back Kotter.", "NTA. Smart kids NEED people who understand that they're still kids, and being good at academics doesn't mean they'll act like much older adults. Too many kids have been hurt by people's assumptions that intelligent and/or studious kids are also necessarily quiet, reserved, well-behaved kids, when that's just not the case and has never been the case.\n\nYour joke was a compliment to them while also acknowledging that they are kids who act like kids sometimes. It's hard to make a joke that's actually *affirming* but you did it!", "One of my students said he didn't want to take french anymore, he wanted to take gtm, so I stuck my tongue out at him, so he stuck his tongue out at me, so I stuck my tongue out at him, so he stuck his tongue out at me.  A few minutes later he said something brilliant in French and I gave him a round of applause and a marble.\n\nSometimes people who aren't teachers don't understand how teachers talk to kids.", "NTA. As the parent of a high school junior taking APUSH, who would absolutely be one of those kids goofing off, I'd be thankful they're not robotic automatons and still have some fun and some personality, and thankful their teacher had a sense of humor and level of comfort joking with them. I also teach high school, nothing you said was REMOTELY out of line, and SIL sounds like a stick in the mud.", "INFO: how overt was your \u201csomewhat joking\u201d tone?\n\nYou do mention you banter like this in the classroom in general at other times, but even so\u2026 I was raised in a family where teasing was a major form of showing affection and it was death by a thousand cuts. When I tried speaking up about it, I was gaslit, so I stopped and suffered in silence. Having been in that position where I was afraid to say something, a part of me wants to say you could be TA (softly) just because you might never know how much those casual jokes can damage. So I tend to steer away from them in general with everyone unless I have clear explicit permission and we\u2019ve established what to do if it goes too far. In that context (I am also an AP teacher), I would have gone more in the direction of \u201cthese are some of the hardest-working students in my class and what a great idea to take a break and have some fun before going back to hitting the books again with a refreshed brain\u201d.\n\n*Even so, it would be a very very soft TA\u2026I\u2019ve definitely heard MUCH worse from teachers to students. Unless SIL saw something you missed, it\u2019s possible she may be overreacting to say you definitely did it. But it is something useful to be aware of.", "NTA", "NTA, sounds like a perfectly appropriate joke to make", "NTA teachers who joke with the kids are the best. As long as it's meant harmlessly and no feelings were hurt I see no issue.", "Nta. Your sil doesn't even know them. Why is she attributing thoughts to them? Ignore her.", "Exactly. I once ran into a teacher during summer break when me and a buddy were hanging around outside a supermarket for some reason. I dunno, nothing nefarious but can't remember why we were there. \n\nTeacher saw us sitting outside, started rubbing his head and muttered something about 6 months of therapy going down the drain. Then winked at us and walked on.", "And APUSH is one of the hardest classes a high school student can take. Blowing off a little steam is no big deal. Sil is a weirdo."]}
