This all started about 9 months ago at my new job about a month or 2 after I started. My supervisor (42M) started bringing in his personal drone to show it off to the guys to see their reaction. I have always thought they were cool cause I was always been into technology since I was a kid. He continued to bring in new drones that he would get to show them off. Then one day on my shift I see something flying in the air, assumed it was possibly a plane cause I work not far from a airport but I was mistaken. My boss comes in talks about different behaviors that I was doing and then told me how he was using his drone to monitor my behavior. Internally I was freaking the F out! But played it cool and told him hey this isn't cool with me that's overstepping his position. He gave a bullsh\\*t excuse of he's allowed to monitor me and that he had permission, so I let it go. Then a few weeks later again caught his drone monitoring me and gave him the talk about how I'm not ok with this and its creepy and I would call the cops and he told me I have no evidence and they will do nothing. Few weeks after that it happened again, and layed it down the next time he did it I'm calling the cops or were gonna have an issue so he stopped. now about month ago he decided to bring it in again, I was infuriated but kept my mouth shut cause I was still processing his stupidity. So when I got home called HR gave them a report and talked to his higher-ups as well as the police and they said that the technically can't do anything cause he possibly has permission and that basically because of his position it's a blurred line. The cops told me to call my site that I work at higher ups to see if he had permission, HE DID NOT!!! He had permission from the place he sat and thought that was ok, like WTF. So a few days later everyone thought it was creepy that I've discussed this with and told this is going to immediately be taken care of, or so I thought. I had a few days off and tried relaxing about it then I decided to call the day before I went in and got put on the phone with the bad manager and basically got told he wasn't doing anything illegal and that it won't happen again and basically he got a slap on the wrist. This guy has a kid and a wife, what if his wife supervisor started doing that to her or teachers started using them to monitor the kids?

Get another job.", "Nta. You said you're not far from an airport. Call the FAA and report the drone. He may be in violation of federal laws. Also, start looking for a new job. This jerk's unhinged!", "Why would the supervisor be invading OP's privacy? He was watching him at work which is certainly within the purview of a supervisor. The means were odd but the supervisor could have just as easily had a camera in the guard booth and watched that, which would also be possibly reasonable if they needed to monitor him. \n\nNo judge is going to issue a restraining order against a supervisor for watching an employee at work when the employee is at their assigned work location and that is the only place the supervisor is observing them.", "What privacy do you have at work, except for in the bathroom?", "Yeah that would help them but sadly like previously said in the story they couldn't interfere cause of a weird legal loop whole cause of his position", "And why would OP think it's a crime?  Usually a supervisors job is to supervise, and that's what he was doing.", "There are a multitude of other ways for a supervisor to monitor and review the work of their department. This manager likes to play with his toys and uses them in a way that is inappropriate. If he wants to monitor OP's progress, he can just ASK him. But using a drone to spy is just weird. While the boss may of had permission to fly the drones on the property, he didn't have permission to use for work. He's also not using it during his shift. He was using personal time to annoy someone that was on the clock.", "That has zero to do with a toxic work environment such as this. This is simply your opinion, and a bad one at that.", "OP Here, Was thinking could be a possible crime because he wasn't on shift so he was using his own personal time and personal drone to watch me if that clears it up for you.", "Ah I see.  Yeah that's pretty creepy if he wasn't working.", "Thank you glad to clear this up", "he might be able to get away with it legally, but it\u2019s absolutely psychotic asshole behavior", "Agreed. Never said it was okay, kua that he could do it", "NTA OP.  Your supervisor sounds creepy AF.", "YTA\n\nYour boss is definitely being weird in how he is monitoring you, but this is no different than working under security cameras or a boss watching you from an office. You are on the clock every time this has happened, so what is the deal? You don\u2019t want you boss watching you? You don\u2019t want to be caught slacking off?", "NTA! as someone with a over a decade spent in the police and security industry I have a number of questions: \n\n1. Does the site you work at utilise CCTV\n2. Is it actively monitored \n3. Do the operators conduct \u2018CCTV patrols\u2019 at random intervals? \n4. Is there a written policy for the use of CCTV\n5. Is there signage denoting it\u2019s use? \n\nIf it\u2019s not to any of these questions I would have SERIOUS concerns who else this bellend has inadvertently been \u2018monitoring\u2019 whilst at a place of work and consider the myriad of legal ramifications.", "Yeah, this. Airports all over the world don't take too kindly to people flying unauthorised aircraft near them."]}
