Let\u2019s call them Jen (27F) and Kate (32F). I am the only one of us with no children. I booked and paid for a site over 3 months ago at my favorite camping area in Delaware, right by a lake. My friends and I talked all winter about wanting to go camping when it\u2019s warm out. We originally entertained the idea of it being a group thing where we all brought our S/O\u2019s, but that would have meant that Kate\u2019s kids (12F and 6F) would need to come too because she doesn\u2019t trust anyone but herself and her husband to watch them due to her older daughter having severe behavioral challenges. Kate being able to get away from the stress for a weekend was all part of the plan. With that being said, we decided before I booked the site that we wouldn\u2019t invite anyone but the 3 of us. \n\n\nFor months we\u2019ve been elated talking about hiking, getting drunk around the campfire, going night swimming in the lake, etc. and just generally cutting loose. Well I found out today via Jen that Kate\u2019s husband mentioned to Jen in passing that the younger daughter will be staying home with him and the older daughter is going on the camping trip with Kate. When Jen asked Kate about it, she said that her husband didn\u2019t want to be \u201cstuck\u201d with the older daughter because her behavioral challenges are worse when she has to be away from her mom. For context, Kate\u2019s husband is not the biological father of her children. He is their step dad. \n\n\nJen and I would not have known about the daughter coming if Kate\u2019s husband didn\u2019t mention it because Kate never brought it up to us. The three of us talked this morning and Jen and I expressed to Kate that we are not comfortable having her child there when we are wanting to get drunk and have fun adult time as we all planned. Kate called us selfish and said we should just \u201cdial back\u201d the festivities a little to make it more child-friendly. Personally, I\u2019d prefer that Kate not come at all if the only options are that or her bringing her daughter but I cannot say that to her because I know she would react even more emotionally than she already has. I don\u2019t want to seem entitled or like I don\u2019t have empathy for her situation, but I didn\u2019t sign up to spend the weekend helping watch after her kid in the middle of the woods.\n\n\nInstead of asking Kate to not come if she\u2019s gonna bring her kid, I am considering not going on the trip. Originally I wasn\u2019t going to have Jen or Kate contribute towards the cost of the site because they were pitching in with drinks and food, but a petty piece of me also wants to ask Kate to send me money for the site if I choose not to go. \n\nWIBTA if I chose not to go and would I be an even bigger one if I asked Kate to pay me for the site?", "created_utc": 1683822602, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13esalz/aita_if_i_refuse_to_go_on_a_camping_trip_because/", "score": 126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not right that Kate decided to change everything expecting you and the other friend to just accept it. If you don't like the new plan don't feel bad about not going and asking them to pay, or you can just cancel and go with someone that respect you more honestly I don't think that Kate is acting like a good friend.", "NTA. I'm sorry Kate's husband is not able to step up, but that doesn't mean your trip, which was planned as an adult trip, needs to turn into something child-friendly (and yes, I'm sure you'd have to spend part of your time helping Kate watch her child). Not every event has to include children.", "NTA. Uninvite Kate. Because she is the one who shouldn't be going. She tried to pull a fast one on plans that were strictly for adults. You can't trust her. She agreed to the adults only trip & then tried to force you to accept her 12 y/old daughter. Without discussing it with you. That is pretty sh\\*tty of her to do that.", "NTA\n\nKate is the AH for not planning for a place for her daughter to be and for not communicating this to you as soon as she knew her daughter would have to come. She knew what the plans were and it sounds like she wanted to spring this on you at the last minute. It's also not ok that she's the only one who can handle her 12-year-old. That's unhealthy for her AND unhealthy for the kid.\n\nI would say postpone the trip to when the 3 of you can be child-free, but that sounds like it won't happen any time soon.

So it\u2019s absolutely okay to back out of those changed plans.", "NTA, but  you would be if you let your other friend get stuck with the situation. You planned an adult weekend and need to be clear that it's non-negotiable. If Kate can't accept that, then she doesn't have to come. You do not have to compromise your holiday time like that. \n\n I don't care if it's kids, spouses, or other friends. If they weren't originally invited, you do not change the dynamics without the agreement of others.", "NTA, You signed up to use your time/money for an adults only trip, not to host a summer camp. However, Kate is clearly overwhelmed and defensive about her child, (and her husband seems a bit of ta here) I think you are not obligated to pay for the campsite but if you care at all about maintaining your friendship with Kate you should still offer to pay for the campsite.", "NTA whatever you choose to do. You all agreed that there would be no children. The problem with this is Kate's husband. He has unilaterally decided to change your plan for you. Kate has the option of not going, going but not bringing her older daughter, or taking over the campsite from you and paying for it. How does your other friend feel? If she also doesn't want to go, then it's just Kate and her daughter,  so of course she should pay.  If Jen chooses to suck it up and go anyway, then absolutely the 2 of them should pay, and you should not. Kate tried to pull a fast one.", "NTA, Jfc some parents can be so entitled. The behavior issues are unfortunate but I can kinda see why they're happening based off the parents attitude", "NTA, but you will be if you don't outright tell Kate that she can't come if she's bringing the kid, or cancel altogether. Don't dance around it. \n\nIt's not cool to bring your disabled kid on an extended girl's-night camping trip, and Kate should understand that. She's probably displacing her anger at her shitty husband onto you guys, because it's easier to say you're bad friends than admit she married a guy who isn't willing to parent the children she already had.", "NTA. It's not what you signed up for and people with kids need to realize that others don't always want to interact with their kids. Especially since the kid is high needs and would no doubt require constant attention throughout the trip and would change the dynamic of the trip completely. It's incredibly selfish of Kate to bring her kid and not tell you and just assume it was okay. NTA for backing out and the jury is still out on the whole money thing, I'd personally just say forget it and move on or cancel the site and tell them they can book on their own if they want.", "NTA for not going. If you can get your money back I would cancel the trip all together, she all by her lonesome decided that your adult activities could be brought to a family friendly level for a 12 year old. And wasn't telling you. Was her plan to just show up with the kid and say \"welp, we're all here now, make the best of it?\" that's AH behavior.", "NTA. What a horribly entitled \u201cfriend.\u201d \n\n\u201cJust change up everything at the last minute and miss out on everything you have been looking forward to to make the trip revolve around my kid!\u201d", "Tell her. She will Never stop foisting her kid on you if you don\u2019t say No.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nKate was 100% going to show up with her daughter with no advanced notice, to where you couldn't back out at that point without looking like a jerk to her kid. \n\nI do feel for Kate with her daughter's behavioral challenges, but she's going about this all wrong. \n\nI'd probably talk to Jen first and tell her that you're thinking of backing out of the trip due to this. Things are almost certainly going to go nuclear once you tell Kate, so you should give Jen a heads up in advance - it'd also be good to know if she's still planning on going or not, too. \n\nIn any case, you aren't the asshole here for a multitude of reasons.", ">she said that her husband didn\u2019t want to be \u201cstuck\u201d with the older daughter \n\nKate should seriously rethink her marriage. Her husband knew she has kids when they got together. I would never forgive my partner if he used this term to talk about my kids\n\nNTA.", "NTA. I would be seriously pissed. And would eight uninvite Kate, cancel the trip altogether or just bowing out but then making them pay.", "YTA if you decide to play petty games instead of using your words. \n\nTell Kate this is an adults-only camping trip. No one\u2019s kids are invited, she cannot bring her daughter.  She knew this and was hoping to sneak her daughter along, and now is trying to use guilt to get you guys to deal with her kid instead of confronting her husband about the fact he\u2019s so useless he can\u2019t look after the kids for two days.\n\nIf Kate throws a tantrum, let her tantrum and then ask her if she wants to come alone or pay her portion of the deposit.", "NTA. You expected an adults only trip and someone else decided to change that.", "NTA  for staying home. Asking for money is a little tougher without knowing what was agreed on (you pay for campsite, they pay for food,)", "Just cancel - it would be easier. Or if you think that would be a big thing, then have her use it but charge her for the site and remove yourself. \n\nKate is the AH here for springing her kid without asking you guys. I get that parents need a break sometimes but you all agreed beforehand AND she didnt mention anything. She literally was going to show up with her daughter and ruin the trip for you and Jen. Think about Jen and her kids...that's not fair in all honesty. I am a parent of two young boys and I would never do this without asking my friends.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nI have kids, now adults, and I would never presume to invite them on an adults only trip. It's rude, likely dull as hell for the kid, and entitled. \n\nI agree w/ the others. Either cancel and r/s with just Kate or be frank with her that this is an adults only trip and you won't dial back a single adult activity, fair warning.", "NTA, Jesus some parents can be so entitled. Don\u2019t opt out of going on the trip yourself. Un-invite Kate, tell her not to come if she\u2019s going to go back on your original agreement, or just cancel the trip altogether and when Kate asks why, tell her you\u2019d rather wait until she can abide by the agreement.", "You and your friend go, drop the dead one. nta", "NTA, it was scummy of her to not tell anyone the change in plans. If not for her husband saying something you all would have found out too late.", "NTA but tell Kate she can't bring her kid because the plan was always the three of you.\n\nYou and Jen can go yourselves.", "NTA but you should absolutely say that to her. \u201cIf you insist on bringing your child to the adults-only trip we agreed on, you should just not come\u201d.", "NTA - don't be a doormat and let Kate walk all over you.  There's no longer any point asking her to leave the kid at home because of the inevitable tensions following that so simply uninvite her.", "I wouldn't worry about what Kate thinks. Kate purposefully hid it from you and was just going to spring it on you the day of. She's not a good friend.\n\nShe knows it would change the entire vibe of the trip *you* had planned. Go with Jen and send Kate a bill. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. She selfishly decided to change the entire adults only dynamic without consulting the other two people. You only found out by chance, otherwise she was expecting to show with her daughter and then it would be too late to cancel. \n\nI'm a adult with kids. I never took my kids somewhere they wouldn't be welcome. It meant missing out on a lot of activities, but that's the hazard of parenthood.", "NTA. Maybe open the possibility of a more family-friendly trip in the future, but having a badly behaved 12 year old girl on a camping trip with three adults....welcome to hell.  The opposite of stress free.", "Absolutely NTA. I have kids. I love my kids. We also have an adults-only trip that we do with about 12-14 friends each year, for about the past 15 years. One friend got married and gained a stepchild, and suddenly wanted to make the trip ok to bring kids on, and the rest of us absolutely put our feet down. I go on that trip for adult fun where I don\u2019t have to worry about a kid falling in the lake or something, I told them we just wouldn\u2019t come anymore if anyone brought a kid. \nBut I don\u2019t think you should cancel the trip, just tell Kate she can\u2019t come unless she can do it without her daughter. And shame on her for trying to \u201csurprise\u201d you with it.", "NTA. \n\nThis was your vacation. Don't go. Do something fun to treat yourself instead. Let her use the campsite you paid for because otherwise you'd be pulling the plug on the whole vacation. Just eat the cost and make plans without her moving forward.", "I would say I cancelled the whole thing and go with Jen. But I am petty\n\nNTA", "NTA, but go a tiny bit easier on Kate. I can\u2019t imagine how much it must suck to have a high needs child and a spouse who point blank refuses to ever let you have a break from being the primary caretaker. Given that her husband was the one who mentioned it, I actually wonder whether Kate was still trying to get him to agree to allowing her the child free weekend.\n\nShe\u2019s still the asshole 100%.

Organize a different trip with Kate and find another friend to fill her spot.", "NTA - Kate has a major AH  for a husband, but instead of dealing with that, she decided to be just as big of one and try to ambush her friends and bring along her daughter without saying anything ahead of time. It would have been much harder for you to deal with the situation with no advance warning, and she knew it. Simply talk to your other friend and let her know that you will not be coming because you have no intention of spending what was supposed to be a fun weekend babysitting a child with behavioral issues in the middle of nowhere. Your friend can make the decision as to whether she wants to do that or simply back out as well. Kate can deal with the fallout either way and pay for the location if she wants to take her daughter on the trip.", "Yep, I'm going to agree with this one here. NTA.  I don't feel like you should cancel the trip, as you have been looking forward to it, and you deserve to get away and cut loose.

That\u2019s over a decade to have figured out SOME kind of alternative to only the mother being the caretaker for even a weekend. Her Husband is now a stepdad. That\u2019s a parent. He needs to step up and handle a difficult weekend. This is on Kate for never working on that support system, or at the very least having worked out a system to slowly add the stepfather into the caretaker role.
