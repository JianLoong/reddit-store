Let\u2019s call them Jen (27F) and Kate (32F). I am the only one of us with no children. I booked and paid for a site over 3 months ago at my favorite camping area in Delaware, right by a lake. My friends and I talked all winter about wanting to go camping when it\u2019s warm out. We originally entertained the idea of it being a group thing where we all brought our S/O\u2019s, but that would have meant that Kate\u2019s kids (12F and 6F) would need to come too because she doesn\u2019t trust anyone but herself and her husband to watch them due to her older daughter having severe behavioral challenges. Kate being able to get away from the stress for a weekend was all part of the plan. With that being said, we decided before I booked the site that we wouldn\u2019t invite anyone but the 3 of us. \n\n\nFor months we\u2019ve been elated talking about hiking, getting drunk around the campfire, going night swimming in the lake, etc. and just generally cutting loose. Well I found out today via Jen that Kate\u2019s husband mentioned to Jen in passing that the younger daughter will be staying home with him and the older daughter is going on the camping trip with Kate. When Jen asked Kate about it, she said that her husband didn\u2019t want to be \u201cstuck\u201d with the older daughter because her behavioral challenges are worse when she has to be away from her mom. For context, Kate\u2019s husband is not the biological father of her children. He is their step dad. \n\n\nJen and I would not have known about the daughter coming if Kate\u2019s husband didn\u2019t mention it because Kate never brought it up to us. The three of us talked this morning and Jen and I expressed to Kate that we are not comfortable having her child there when we are wanting to get drunk and have fun adult time as we all planned. Kate called us selfish and said we should just \u201cdial back\u201d the festivities a little to make it more child-friendly. Personally, I\u2019d prefer that Kate not come at all if the only options are that or her bringing her daughter but I cannot say that to her because I know she would react even more emotionally than she already has. I don\u2019t want to seem entitled or like I don\u2019t have empathy for her situation, but I didn\u2019t sign up to spend the weekend helping watch after her kid in the middle of the woods.\n\n\nInstead of asking Kate to not come if she\u2019s gonna bring her kid, I am considering not going on the trip. Originally I wasn\u2019t going to have Jen or Kate contribute towards the cost of the site because they were pitching in with drinks and food, but a petty piece of me also wants to ask Kate to send me money for the site if I choose not to go. \n\nWIBTA if I chose not to go and would I be an even bigger one if I asked Kate to pay me for the site?", "created_utc": 1683822602, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13esalz/aita_if_i_refuse_to_go_on_a_camping_trip_because/", "score": 373, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The two of you should decide if you want to cancel. I personally would politely uninvite her. You wouldn't have known if the husband didn't let it slip.

If you don't like the new plan don't feel bad about not going and asking them to pay, or you can just cancel and go with someone that respect you more honestly I don't think that Kate is acting like a good friend.", "NTA. I'm sorry Kate's husband is not able to step up, but that doesn't mean your trip, which was planned as an adult trip, needs to turn into something child-friendly (and yes, I'm sure you'd have to spend part of your time helping Kate watch her child). Not every event has to include children.", "NTA. Uninvite Kate. Because she is the one who shouldn't be going. She tried to pull a fast one on plans that were strictly for adults. You can't trust her. She agreed to the adults only trip & then tried to force you to accept her 12 y/old daughter. Without discussing it with you. That is pretty sh\\*tty of her to do that.", "NTA\n\nKate is the AH for not planning for a place for her daughter to be and for not communicating this to you as soon as she knew her daughter would have to come. She knew what the plans were and it sounds like she wanted to spring this on you at the last minute. It's also not ok that she's the only one who can handle her 12-year-old. That's unhealthy for her AND unhealthy for the kid.\n\nI would say postpone the trip to when the 3 of you can be child-free, but that sounds like it won't happen any time soon.

So it\u2019s absolutely okay to back out of those changed plans.", "NTA, but  you would be if you let your other friend get stuck with the situation. You planned an adult weekend and need to be clear that it's non-negotiable. If Kate can't accept that, then she doesn't have to come. You do not have to compromise your holiday time like that. \n\n I don't care if it's kids, spouses, or other friends. If they weren't originally invited, you do not change the dynamics without the agreement of others.", "NTA, You signed up to use your time/money for an adults only trip, not to host a summer camp. However, Kate is clearly overwhelmed and defensive about her child, (and her husband seems a bit of ta here) I think you are not obligated to pay for the campsite but if you care at all about maintaining your friendship with Kate you should still offer to pay for the campsite.", "NTA whatever you choose to do. You all agreed that there would be no children. The problem with this is Kate's husband. He has unilaterally decided to change your plan for you. Kate has the option of not going, going but not bringing her older daughter, or taking over the campsite from you and paying for it. How does your other friend feel? If she also doesn't want to go, then it's just Kate and her daughter,  so of course she should pay.  If Jen chooses to suck it up and go anyway, then absolutely the 2 of them should pay, and you should not. Kate tried to pull a fast one.", "NTA, Jfc some parents can be so entitled. The behavior issues are unfortunate but I can kinda see why they're happening based off the parents attitude", "NTA, but you will be if you don't outright tell Kate that she can't come if she's bringing the kid, or cancel altogether. Don't dance around it. \n\nIt's not cool to bring your disabled kid on an extended girl's-night camping trip, and Kate should understand that. She's probably displacing her anger at her shitty husband onto you guys, because it's easier to say you're bad friends than admit she married a guy who isn't willing to parent the children she already had.", "NTA. It's not what you signed up for and people with kids need to realize that others don't always want to interact with their kids. Especially since the kid is high needs and would no doubt require constant attention throughout the trip and would change the dynamic of the trip completely. It's incredibly selfish of Kate to bring her kid and not tell you and just assume it was okay. NTA for backing out and the jury is still out on the whole money thing, I'd personally just say forget it and move on or cancel the site and tell them they can book on their own if they want.", "NTA for not going. If you can get your money back I would cancel the trip all together, she all by her lonesome decided that your adult activities could be brought to a family friendly level for a 12 year old. And wasn't telling you. Was her plan to just show up with the kid and say \"welp, we're all here now, make the best of it?\" that's AH behavior.", "NTA. What a horribly entitled \u201cfriend.\u201d \n\n\u201cJust change up everything at the last minute and miss out on everything you have been looking forward to to make the trip revolve around my kid!\u201d", "Tell her. She will Never stop foisting her kid on you if you don\u2019t say No.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nKate was 100% going to show up with her daughter with no advanced notice, to where you couldn't back out at that point without looking like a jerk to her kid. \n\nI do feel for Kate with her daughter's behavioral challenges, but she's going about this all wrong. \n\nI'd probably talk to Jen first and tell her that you're thinking of backing out of the trip due to this. Things are almost certainly going to go nuclear once you tell Kate, so you should give Jen a heads up in advance - it'd also be good to know if she's still planning on going or not, too. \n\nIn any case, you aren't the asshole here for a multitude of reasons.", ">she said that her husband didn\u2019t want to be \u201cstuck\u201d with the older daughter \n\nKate should seriously rethink her marriage. Her husband knew she has kids when they got together. I would never forgive my partner if he used this term to talk about my kids\n\nNTA.", "NTA. I would be seriously pissed. And would eight uninvite Kate, cancel the trip altogether or just bowing out but then making them pay.", "YTA if you decide to play petty games instead of using your words. \n\nTell Kate this is an adults-only camping trip. No one\u2019s kids are invited, she cannot bring her daughter.  She knew this and was hoping to sneak her daughter along, and now is trying to use guilt to get you guys to deal with her kid instead of confronting her husband about the fact he\u2019s so useless he can\u2019t look after the kids for two days.\n\nIf Kate throws a tantrum, let her tantrum and then ask her if she wants to come alone or pay her portion of the deposit.", "NTA. You expected an adults only trip and someone else decided to change that.", "NTA  for staying home. Asking for money is a little tougher without knowing what was agreed on (you pay for campsite, they pay for food,)", "Just cancel - it would be easier. Or if you think that would be a big thing, then have her use it but charge her for the site and remove yourself. \n\nKate is the AH here for springing her kid without asking you guys. I get that parents need a break sometimes but you all agreed beforehand AND she didnt mention anything. She literally was going to show up with her daughter and ruin the trip for you and Jen. Think about Jen and her kids...that's not fair in all honesty. I am a parent of two young boys and I would never do this without asking my friends.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nI have kids, now adults, and I would never presume to invite them on an adults only trip. It's rude, likely dull as hell for the kid, and entitled. \n\nI agree w/ the others. Either cancel and r/s with just Kate or be frank with her that this is an adults only trip and you won't dial back a single adult activity, fair warning.", "NTA, Jesus some parents can be so entitled. Don\u2019t opt out of going on the trip yourself. Un-invite Kate, tell her not to come if she\u2019s going to go back on your original agreement, or just cancel the trip altogether and when Kate asks why, tell her you\u2019d rather wait until she can abide by the agreement.", "You and your friend go, drop the dead one. nta", "NTA, it was scummy of her to not tell anyone the change in plans. If not for her husband saying something you all would have found out too late.", "NTA but tell Kate she can't bring her kid because the plan was always the three of you.\n\nYou and Jen can go yourselves.", "NTA but you should absolutely say that to her. \u201cIf you insist on bringing your child to the adults-only trip we agreed on, you should just not come\u201d.", "NTA - don't be a doormat and let Kate walk all over you.  There's no longer any point asking her to leave the kid at home because of the inevitable tensions following that so simply uninvite her.", "I wouldn't worry about what Kate thinks. Kate purposefully hid it from you and was just going to spring it on you the day of. She's not a good friend.\n\nShe knows it would change the entire vibe of the trip *you* had planned. Go with Jen and send Kate a bill. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. She selfishly decided to change the entire adults only dynamic without consulting the other two people. You only found out by chance, otherwise she was expecting to show with her daughter and then it would be too late to cancel. \n\nI'm a adult with kids. I never took my kids somewhere they wouldn't be welcome. It meant missing out on a lot of activities, but that's the hazard of parenthood.", "NTA. Maybe open the possibility of a more family-friendly trip in the future, but having a badly behaved 12 year old girl on a camping trip with three adults....welcome to hell.  The opposite of stress free.", "Absolutely NTA. I have kids. I love my kids. We also have an adults-only trip that we do with about 12-14 friends each year, for about the past 15 years. One friend got married and gained a stepchild, and suddenly wanted to make the trip ok to bring kids on, and the rest of us absolutely put our feet down. I go on that trip for adult fun where I don\u2019t have to worry about a kid falling in the lake or something, I told them we just wouldn\u2019t come anymore if anyone brought a kid. \nBut I don\u2019t think you should cancel the trip, just tell Kate she can\u2019t come unless she can do it without her daughter. And shame on her for trying to \u201csurprise\u201d you with it.", "NTA. \n\nThis was your vacation. Don't go. Do something fun to treat yourself instead. Let her use the campsite you paid for because otherwise you'd be pulling the plug on the whole vacation. Just eat the cost and make plans without her moving forward.", "I would say I cancelled the whole thing and go with Jen. But I am petty\n\nNTA", "NTA, but go a tiny bit easier on Kate. I can\u2019t imagine how much it must suck to have a high needs child and a spouse who point blank refuses to ever let you have a break from being the primary caretaker. Given that her husband was the one who mentioned it, I actually wonder whether Kate was still trying to get him to agree to allowing her the child free weekend.\n\nShe\u2019s still the asshole 100%.

Organize a different trip with Kate and find another friend to fill her spot.", "NTA - Kate has a major AH  for a husband, but instead of dealing with that, she decided to be just as big of one and try to ambush her friends and bring along her daughter without saying anything ahead of time. It would have been much harder for you to deal with the situation with no advance warning, and she knew it. Simply talk to your other friend and let her know that you will not be coming because you have no intention of spending what was supposed to be a fun weekend babysitting a child with behavioral issues in the middle of nowhere. Your friend can make the decision as to whether she wants to do that or simply back out as well. Kate can deal with the fallout either way and pay for the location if she wants to take her daughter on the trip.", "Yep, I'm going to agree with this one here. NTA.  I don't feel like you should cancel the trip, as you have been looking forward to it, and you deserve to get away and cut loose.

He needs to step up and handle a difficult weekend. This is on Kate for never working on that support system, or at the very least having worked out a system to slowly add the stepfather into the caretaker role.

You two can still go, but I will no longer be attending. You attempted to lie to us about this, knowing it wasn't what we all discussed, so you know you're in the wrong here.\"\n\nIf you're not comfortable or able to be honest with your friend, are yall really friends?", "200% NTA. Its not on sneaking her problematic child onto an adults only trip. Me, I'd maybe not ask for the money back unless it's over 100 bucks but your well within realms of decency to not want to spend your vacation time babysitting and having your \"downtime\" curtailed.", "NTA. You booked and paid for the whole thing. Cancel it all and call it a day. If Kate cannot trust her husband to watch his step children, then I guess she is stuck with them forever because the husband's job to watch the kids is equally important. Kate needs to focus on her child's behavioral issues before anything else. \n\nBut it sucks for Jen because she is truly the innocent bystander in all of this. But if you and Jen cannot just go just the two of you, and Kate will bring the child no matter what, then cancel it all. If you lose money on it, chalk it up to experience.", "NTA Kate was well aware of the plans. If her husband or the kid\u2019s father can\u2019t watch the daughter for the weekend, then Kate should stay home. This gives you and Jen the opportunity to either continue on with your plans, or cancel and do something else entirely. Kate being your friend does NOT make watching or having your vacation plans ruined or altered by her child, special needs or not.", "NTA. You cant let your friend control you. Tell her sorry, its a no kid weekend. I will be gettin wasted. I will use lots of profanity and I will be naked at times. While I love you and your family, this weekend idea was mine, and I have been looking forward to an adults only trip and am not interested in changing that.", "NTA for not wanting anyone to bring any kids.  YTA for not being adult enough to tell Kate that this was planned as an adult trip only.  Sorry, no kids allowed.  We have been planning this trip for months.  We are not changing our plans. I need this time away to relax, drink and whatever.   I would talk with Jen and get her feelings in the subject and go from there.  You both need to be on the same page.  If Jen is ok with it, tell her you are not and will not be going.  And let them know what the cost will be.  But also discuss the cost between you and Jen if you tell Kate no.   And skate knew exactly what she was doing.  She knew you all would not be happy about the situation, but once there, what would you do?  You need to nip this in the bud now.   As for her husband, he is the selfish one for not giving his wife a break.  And Kate as well.  So because her husband does not want to be stuck with her child, she just decided to bring her along and you all are stuck with her?  That is selfish in Kates part.", "NTA.  Kate shouldn't have altered the plans without your knowledge.  I know it wouldn't be as much fun (also depends on the severity of the behavioral issues), but it may still be a fun time.  Reconsider after you've cooled off emotionally?", "NTA. I\u2019m a mom of 3. I got a campsite this weekend for mothers day for a couple nights. I invited my friends, but expressly said, this is a childfree campsite this weekend, so yea I\u2019d be upset if someone brought their kid haha. I would assume part of this trip for her is her needing a break like we all do, and it\u2019s not a real break if she has her kid with her.", "NTA", "Kate needs to leave her kid at home or with relatives. If she\u2019s unwilling she can stay home and you and Jenn can bring your significant others.\n\nJust tell her. Don\u2019t ruin your own trip for someone who was willing to do that to you.\n\nNTA", "NTA.. this is unacceptable and she knows it.. thats why she didnt tell you", "NTA - Explain to Kate that this getaway was for the three adults. Since she has now demanded that her child be included, give her two options:  1.  she can stay home with her daughter, or 2. give her the campsite to take her daughter camping, and you and Jen go elsewhere for an adults-only getaway.\n\nKate is the Ah for adding her daughter to the trip.", "NTA to both questions.\n\n> Jen and I expressed to Kate that we are not comfortable having her child there when we are wanting to get drunk and have fun adult time as we all planned. Kate called us selfish and said we should just \u201cdial back\u201d the festivities a little to make it more child-friendly\n\nYou initially agreed that the this would be a kid-free trip and you planned accordingly. This is not being selfish, this is you being adult and responsible. If the intent of the trip was to relax and have some adult fun, bringing a child would be counterintuitive and irresponsable.\n\nI thing Kate wants to have a relaxing camping trip with two babysitters to watch her daughter for free.\n\nDoes Kate's daughter have experience in camping? Is she used to hiking or to sleeping in a different place? If not, I don't think an overnight camping trip isn't safe for her because it will be lots of new sensory experiences that may be outside of her confort zone. How safe will her daughter be if she has an episode at night close to the campfire or close to the river?", "NTA at all", "NTA it\u2019s an adult only kid free weekend. Your friend with the uncontrollable child should stay home.", "NTA but have a straight convo.\n\nShe knew the details. She either finds care for her kid or she doesn\u2019t come. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t get to bamboozle you out of a trip or ruin the fun.\n\nWho cares if she gets emotional?", "NTA. You planned 3 months in advance, and all the plans were clearly laid out. Go without Kate.", "NTA-cancel and make her pay for it.", "Nta", "NTA.  Talk to Jen about if you should uninvite Kate, then do so or cancel the whole thing.  If they want to go without you then yes they need to pay you for the site.\n\nThe worst part is that Kate was acting in secrecy.  She should have told you.", "Drop Kate and maybe invite someone else. What she did was such an asshole move", "I think the correct thing would be uninviting Kate if she insists on bringing her daughter. She wasn\u2019t even going to tell you the daughter was coming which means she knew it would mess with the plans and you\u2019d both be upset. NTA but definitely don\u2019t cancel or choose not to go", "Adluts NEED time away from their kids because if they don't i beleive it will cause the parents to have mental break down. \n\nI know everyone wants kids and love to be parents but sometimes you and your SO need time and space away from the kids to keep the realtionship healthy and strong then getting wrose and one parent doing everything \n\nNTA", "NTA Kate is being a horrible friend AND parent. How did she expect this to play out? You and Jen would just roll with it and make sacrifices so she doesn't have to? Kate is an AH.", "She knew what she was doing. She was going to keep quiet and show up with her kid. \n\n\"Well, I guess we just have to deal now, we're already here right \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\" \n\nNTA. Also, its your reservation. Tell Kate she simply cant come. It was inconsiderate and frankly, Sneaky of her to try to pull a stunt like that. We're all adults here, she could have communicated. \n\nEven if she did last minute say she wouldnt bring the kid, she's just be salty the whole trip & ruin it that way regardless. You and other friend go on a duo trip. Maybe invite a separate 3rd person. \n\nI may sound petty, but dont cancel your fun because she chose to rude. Just means she canceled her right to go.", "Don't be an asshole to yourself. You planned and booked the trip. Your friend didn't mention her behaviourally-challenged child coming along because she knew it would be a no.\n\nTell her it's a no. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  I don't know how much money you've paid for the site, but if you can, you might consider eating the cost rather than being petty.  Yes, you're in the right, and Kate is wrong to do this (rather than just bow out of the trip herself), but she's obviously dealing with a tough home situation.  I would cancel, but try to be gentle.", "Considering she didn't say anything to you two, she knows you wouldn't approve. She knew what she was doing.\n\nDefinitely NTA", "NTA\n\nJust cancel the reservation altogether.  Explain to Kate that you wanted an adult trip, not one that's kid friendly and it wasn't cool of her to try to sneak this past you and Jen.", "NTA-Go by yourself or with the other friend. Politely explain that you paid for an adult girlfriend only trip. That\u2019s on her if her daughter is so out of control that no one wants to be around her. You shouldn\u2019t have to suffer", "NTA.  She conveniently left out the fact that she planned to bring her kid. Don\u2019t feel bad cancelling.\n\n*side note: this may end the friendship.", "If I were you, I would ask Kate not to come. It sucks that she can't get a break, but you agreed this would be a no child vacation and Kate essentially lied to you. Alternatively, cancel the whole trip and see if you can get a reimbursement.", "NTA. Uninvite her. Her childcare issues are not your problem.", "Kate the AH here.", "NTA. I'd just say you weren't going and tell them you sincerely hope they have a good time.\n\nMy husband and I have a strict no kids allowed on vacation policy. We don't have children but most of our friends do. We've been invited on multiple vacations where kids are going and we always say no.\n\nThere are even some that we'd consider going with. But we won't open up that can of worms.", "NTA. What a shady ass move trying to sneak the kid along", "Kate knows she is wrong, which is why she didn't bother telling you her A H husband is refusing to parent for a weekend. Did she plan on just showing up with the kid?\n\nThis isn't what you want in a vacation, and Kate and her husband are essentially taking your vacation and making it her kid's vacation. Cancel the trip and let them plan another one of they want to go. If you can't get your money back, send them a request for 2/3 of the money back. Kate's daughter isn't the only one who doesn't know how to behave. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nHowever, if you all are extremely close friends, I would use this as a way to have a tough conversation with Kate about her husband. \n\nThe whole point of this trip was for the three of you to catch up *and* for Kate to have a break to avoid burnout. Instead of giving her this break Kates husband guilted her into taking her daughter with her. \n\nIt\u2019s manipulative, it\u2019s cruel to your group, to Kate, and to her daughter, and it suggests some bigger issue sharpening when it comes to their parenting and relationship. \n\nUnless there are some major details missing it sounds like it\u2019s time to check in with Kate to see how things are going and whether she\u2019s actually okay.", "NTA\n\nKate changed the entire trip by trying to sneak hin her daughter. This is not the vacation you planned and you're not okay with changes.\n\nI could understand if she called and asked you and Jen, but she tried to force your hand and that's not okay. \n\nI'd tell her I'm not coming and let her know that if she's still going $ Is owed. Maybe she'll be so pissed she'll refuse to go and you and Jen can have some fun.\n\nAlso if this isn't the first time Kate has \u2018not mentioned\u2019 something important, it maybe be there me to distance yourself from her.", "Exactly.  I\"d just cancel the whole thing rather than try to sort out some trip between them that you're not going on.\n\nCancel the reservation, just say \"its getting to complicated, i don't have the bandwidth to arrange this one anymore, let's chat some other time about maybe a different trip.\"", "NTA- but hear me out. Sounds like Kate is in a crazy rough spot. Can you talk to her about what\u2019s going on with her daughter and step dad? I hope she\u2019s ok.", "Back when our friend was still with his ex, we had all planned a camping trip when we found out they planned on bringing their baby. We politely backed out, saying we didn\u2019t feel like camping with a baby would be fun for us. Apparently his ex threw a fit the entire time they were there about what crappy people we were to not want to camp with a baby.", "She also should be more open to the idea of hiring a (specialised) babysitter if she want to have a social life, after all they have to be apart at some point in their lives", "exactly. then go do something fun", "100% agree. Kate is OP's guest, she doesn't get to rearrange the entire trip to suit herself. You can feel sorry for her family situation and still not want her kid on your vacation.", "Exactly. Stop being bullied by Kate.", "This is the best approach. \n\nOP, has she approached 12F\u2019s dad about taking her since SD doesn\u2019t want to be \u2018stuck\u2019 with her? Kate is being an AH by trying to pull one over you and Jen\u2026it\u2019s her problem to solve so you can enjoy the trip you planned, with or without her.", "Instead of using you words? She did say it's not appropriate to bring the kid and it fell on deaf ears.....", "Good insight. Sounds like a wild time in that fam.", "Yup, this one. \n\nDon\u2019t let Kate ruin your vacation, and do this. You deserve a break and a camping trip *without* uninvited guests.", "I have a suspicion that Kate will try to pull \"you don't understand what it's like to have a kid that has different needs\" or something like that, to guilt trip her.  \n\nI don't know if she's afraid to talk to her friend or that OP knows the response she'll get.\n\nI'm hoping I'm wrong, though.", "OP can have the shiniest spine you want, that won't stop Kate from just showing up with her daughter.", "I feel horrible for Kate.  She is 100% the AH in this situation. \n\nBut she\u2019s also been handed a crap hand in life-her 12 yo has behavioral problems, the step dad is half useless, she just wants time away.  \n\n**Im not excusing Kate, she is 100% the AH here** \n\nI just also feel sorry for everything else she\u2019s dealing with. That sucks. But there is no reason for her to make everyone else\u2019s trip suck too.", "or he did it so Kate couldn't spring it last minute like she planned", "Agreed. It was wrong of her to not tell them, but her husband can't have not figured out that her taking one leaves him with only one, but his letting it slip is potentially going to put a stop to the trip, which leaves him on his own with none.", ">This is on Kate for never working on that support system, or\n\nWhat an ah thing to say! Like finding someone who will take care of your sn child overnight is easy!\n\nMe and my partner had our first overnight break when our son was eleven and... I am one of the lucky ones! Who had someone offering and able to. Not obvious at all.\n\nWould _you_ take her of her for a few days to give Kate a break? No? Guess what...most of the world is as selfish as you are!", "Not providing you with childcare is selfish?", "Thank you for proving my point!"]}
