On Christmas Day my soon to be sister in law asked if her 5 year old daughter could wear a white dress to the wedding. She told me it was in a shop front in our local shopping centre.

Today I saw the dress and it is basically a wedding dress, big and white tulle with a detailed floral lace body.

That's meant for the bride. It doesn't matter the age of the person wearing it, and it doesn't matter if no one will be \"confused\". Someone's else's wedding is not the place to let a child play dress up or try to guilt a bride into allowing it.\n\nWith so many responses acting like you have to be insecure to care, I'm starting to understand why child free weddings are so popular. People really think a kid being little means nothing applies to them. It's your wedding, enjoy it the way you want to.", "YWBTA if you told her not to. It's a 5 year old. She probably wants to be like you. Find it flattering and enjoy your day because the only person who will care about it is you. Nobody else will ever think \"oh remember when /u/girlwantstoknow1029's niece wore a white dress on her wedding day? How fucked up is that?!\"", "NTA.\n\nNo one is going to mistake your 5 year old niece for a bride because she\u2019s wearing white. But it DOES seem apparent that SIL wants her daughter (and by extension, herself) to get attention on your wedding day.\n\nI do think that even a five year old can get excited about wearing a pretty dress on a special day. But it needn\u2019t be white and she shouldn\u2019t be kitted out to look like a member of your (non-existent) wedding party. \n\nPlease tell her no to the white. The fact that SIL is asking indicates she knows it\u2019s skirting the line of appropriateness.", "NTA\n\nHave your intended tell HIS sister that the dress is not appropriate and should not be purchased or returned if she already bought it.\n\nThis is not her day.

Is BF the only sibling that niece would get the chance to be flower girl at? You could always throw her a curve ball and make the wedding child-free.", "> it is basically a wedding dress, big and white tulle with a detailed floral lace body.\n\nIf it's sized for a five year old, it's not a wedding dress.\n\nThat being said, your SIL is blatantly trying to get her daughter to act as the flower girl, which is inappropriate since she wasn't invited to be one. Fluffy white dress and flower crown on a little girl at a wedding? Yup, that's a flower girl. NTA for saying no.", "NAH. She's allowed to ask, and you're allowed to say no. Personally I think it's ridiculous to get so bent out of shape over what a **five-year-old child** wears to your wedding, but it's your wedding and you can so no if it's really so important to you.", "NAH. The goal of the \"don't wear white\" rule is to let the bride stand out in the crowd and not let anyway be confused about who the bride is. This rule obviously doesn't apply to a 5 years old. You can tell your SIL that you don't like it, and it's fine, but you should know that you don't HAVE to do that.", "NTA", "ESH. your SIL is out of line for not respecting your wishes and trying to sneakily make her daughter the flower girl. you kind of suck for having a 5 year old niece and not letting them be your flower girl. that\u2019s pretty sad, ngl.", "OP isn\u2019t having a bridal party or flower girls. No reason for the niece to be dressed up in a mini wedding dress with a flower crown matching OPs bouquet.\n\n\nIt\u2019s especially rude for the SIL to just demand these things and assuming her daughter will have any role in the wedding without being asked by OP first.

But this line that a dress for a five year old is basically a wedding dress? C'mon, chill the fuck out. It's a white formal dress for small girls, and little girls love puffy dresses with tulle, it's not meant to be \"basically a wedding dress\" and nobody is going to look at the child and think they're wearing a wedding dress.", "NTA but I personally think it looks cute for the very small girls to be dressed like that for a wedding.", "Gentle YTA.  FSIL is being downright sneaky, but your niece is excited about dressing up, as every little girl is.\n\nGet her the flower crown, but don't let her wear the white dress, if the \"upstaging\" thing is an issue - which I don't believe in this case it is.

Who cares if she wants to feel included? This is your future niece. She will remember this always. And will feel a special bond with you.

This is an easy win for you, and you are turning it into a lose lose lose situation that will only dampen your big day, and maybe your future relationship.", "Not strictly, but imo YTA. The kid is 5, no one will be confused about who is the bride nor is she going to be upstaging you.

I\u2019m surprised at the fact that people already think you\u2019re worried about being upstaged by a 5 YO\u2026when said 5 YO probably couldn\u2019t care less if she wears the dress (and flower crown) to the wedding. It\u2019s the mom that seems to want this (which is likely why you\u2019re asking this\u2026.you know it\u2019s the mom\u2019s doing) and if the kiddo gets upset, it\u2019ll be because mom told her she is supposed to be upset at not getting the flower crown or getting to wear the white dress which sounds like it\u2019s basically a wedding dress tailored to a 5 YO size. Here\u2019s an idea\u2026.get the flower crown, but make it clear to your niece that it\u2019s only for a special photo shoot that\u2019s only for you and her where you 2 get to \u201cmatch\u201d. Tell mom that she is NOT to show up at your wedding in that dress, or any dress that even vaguely appears like a wedding dress. The only possible \u201cwedding dress\u201d that would get a pass is if it\u2019s CLEARLY a Disney princess costume, but even that could be considered tacky and a social faux pas. My only thoughts are that FSIL doesn\u2019t like you for some reason and is trying to use her daughter to \u201cupstage\u201d you, or that your future niece is a \u201crainbow baby\u201d or somehow \u201cspecial\u201d and mom has made that her (and niece\u2019s) identity so she has to be shown off and look like she\u2019s the most important person there.", "She\u2019s 5. \n\nNobody will mistake her as the bride.

My niece had on the same style dress as mine and a flower crown, but she was my flower girl. Her mom made sure I approved the dress and I asked her to wear the crown.

The horror.", "The voice of reason here.", "Exactly!!!!! Show her a pink fluffy dress with some (tasteful) sequins and she will forget about the other in a second. \n\nOr just ask her favorite color and go from there. I guarantee it\u2019s not white!", "Wonderful idea.  Outfox the Momager.", "Agree.  Get her a fairy dress.", "SIL is WITHOUT A DOUBT forcing her daughter into the wedding party. \n\nOP - it's either a child free wedding, or your niece is now your flower girl.", "A five year-old would certainly like to wear something more practical than an avalanche of tulle and a floral lace body. Support her against her mother and definitely forbid the white dress.", "Actually that\u2019s a good idea! If OP isn\u2019t too busy with being the bride and all she could!", "This is such a great idea!", "The rule exists so people won't be confused about who the bride is. It doesn't apply to 5-year old children.", "I\u2019ve been thinking since I posted and yes, if she wants to wear a pretty dress and have flowers in her I wouldn\u2019t mind. It\u2019s the not so subtle manipulation of flower girl by stealth (love that name) that I really don\u2019t like or appreciate.", "Well said.", "Definitely SIL trying to be sneaky so people will think the niece is the flower girl.", "I don\u2019t think it shouldn\u2019t apply to children under 10. Even if they don\u2019t understand fully even younger kids can understand hey we can\u2019t wear white on that day.", "No, 10 is old enough to know when it\u2019s not your day you don\u2019t try steal attention. Every event is an opportunity to learn etiquette and manners for that event. Given how many weddings are child-free the rules should be enforced for all ages.\n\nI\u2019d say the rules could be relaxed for children under 3. Above that, they start getting invited to peer events and they need to know appropriate social behaviour.", "And why does that actually matter?", "Your right. I don't know a lot of 5 YO girls. However, I'm referencing wearing this dress to a WEDDING, not kindergarten, not family reunions. A WEDDING. That's the social faux pas that would make people cringe and look towards the bride with questions. Especially when the bride doesn't want her to wear that. They aren't having a wedding party.  No flower girl. No bridesmaids. Nothing that would make the little girl wearing this look cute. On top of that the mom was already basically demanding a matching flower crown for the little girl who is only an invited guest and not part of the bridal party (again, remember there is no bridal party) which she also was pretty much demanding OP to pay for, and all this even before the dress came into play. The only way I could see people thinking how cute it was is if the bride were to make it clear that she loved it and thought it cute, which doesn't seem to be the case here. I reiterate that it feels like mom is treating her little girl like some sort of special \"rainbow baby\" that is required to be the most important person at any event and always the center of attention. Will the little one be disappointed? Probably, but she undoubtedly will forget all about it in the excitement of the actual wedding unless her mother keeps making a big deal out of the situation (and it sounds like mom is gearing up to do just that). This is why I added the statement about a special photo shoot for bride and niece in my original comment. This way the FSIL gets the \"matchy matchy\" look she's angling for and the niece feels special, without the bride feeling like HER special day, where it should be her and her new husband who are the center of attention, getting ruined. And if mom can't make the little one wear something else to the wedding, maybe it's wiser they not attend. Who knows what other thing that doesn't go the way the little one wants to cause a meltdown tantrum (we can't eat any cake first? How dare they! I can't have the first piece of cake? HOW DARE THEY!!!!!). And quite frankly, no-one wants to hear someone else's kid in a full blown tantrum.", "Who is going to be distracted by a child in a white dress and a flower crown at a wedding? At most, they'll think \"oh she's so cute!\" and move on. She's not going to take any attention off of the bride at all.        \n\nI do think the flower crown is too much, but it's not the same thing as having another grown woman show up to a wedding in a wedding dress.", "Yeah - distraction/nuisance is just another word for upstaged. You begrudge your 5 year old niece a dress and won\u2019t let her be a flower girl - your choice absolutely but what harm would it do? I can tell you that the 5 year old will always remember it - up to you whether that\u2019s a good memory or a bad one.\n\nNAH is my judgement.", "Mom is gunning for flower girl, and nothing will get in her way. I'm surprised she didn't tell her li'l princess already.", "100% yes they very much do. All the time.", "I think it's entirely possible a 5-year-old would choose a wedding dress to wear if given the choice. And TBF, I don't really blame the mother for *asking* if her daughter can wear it, as I don't think most brides would feel they'd be upstaged by a 5-year-old. Demanding a flower crown is definitely taking it too far, though!", "Thank you! I thought it was darn adorable. Hopefully a lovely core memory for her and definitely a bonding moment for the fam", "Well, I didn\u2019t choose but SIL asked me and I said of course that\u2019s fine", ">She might look adorable in the photos. The horror\n\nhahahaha I am CRYING. This is perfect. Also, so true.\n\nAny child at a wedding is by default adorable because they are dressed in miniature adult clothes (the tiny suits!!! omg I die). If the marrying couple is afraid of children being adorable, then they should just have a child-free wedding.", "Seriously. So what if some people might think she's a flower girl? And anyway OP was \"so stunned\" when all she knew was that they wanted a white dress, so it seems like she's just dead-set against any female wearing white... even if she's an actual child.", "I would stop including your SIL in wedding conversations about what you\u2019re wearing, etc. as well.", "Why does it matter if a 5 yo is stealthing a flower girl appointment? If she doesn\u2019t walk down the aisle, how does it affect you? You have the chance to bond with her over this and give her a lifelong happy memory.", "She asked and OP didn't say no. They can be adults about it. Would the conversation about the dress be harder than the conversation where the daughter gets uninvited?", "That\u2019s irrelevant. SIL is forcing this", "Because there is risk that the type of people who pull this also go \u201clook she\u2019s dressed the part, just let her do it\u201d.", "It's not about the little girl's happy memory/day, though", "But it is about joining a new family, and forming new family bonds. To me it seems unnecessarily selfish and short sighted to make a big deal about this, when it\u2019s a chance to bond and I just don\u2019t see how it would have any negative effects on the bride. Why would you not want your niece to have happy memories of your wedding?"]}
