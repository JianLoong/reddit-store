We've been married for two years, together for four. My husband is a pretty huge gamer and has his own personal room where he keeps his PC and consoles. Ive never been that big on video games myself, but sometimes i play so i can spend time with my husband, because he almost never leaves that room except for when he needs to go to work or sleep. His day mostly consistsof waking up, going to work, coming hime, then gaming, sleep, repeat. And due to this he never helps out around the house, with the excuse that \"Working a 9 to 5 is hard enough.\". The only times he helps around the house is when i tell him sternly to help me do dishes or something. Sometimes he'll even go on tantrums about how hes exhausted from work and needs time to wind down. ive tried bringing up that i also need time to wind down after work, but he just responds by telling me his work is much harder. Im tired and im done. im packing my bags tommorow night. I tried telling my mom about it but she says im an asshole for not supporting my spouse, and not appreciating the work he does.\n\nWIBTA If i do this?", "created_utc": 1677488235, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11d75wp/wibta_if_i_leave_my_husband_over_video_games/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're not leaving him over video games. You're leaving him over not supporting you and appreciating the hard work you do. Ironic when your mum thinks that's what you should do in your marriage but not your husband.", "NTA, and is wrong with your mother? Your husband is not treating you like an equal partner, hes acting like your teenage son. You are absolutely in the right to not continue to live like this. Somebody should make a more modern my husband is addicted to gaming version of Paula Cole's song.", "NTA \nYour husband is not your child. You shouldn't have to regulate his video game use and be \"stern\" to get him to do chores. \nIf threatening to leave doesn't change his attitude then leave because he cares more about the games than you.\nEdit: a word, ducking autocorrect \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. Seems like this is something brought up before with no actual change.", "So what you\u2019re saying is it\u2019s not the video games, it\u2019s the total lack of desire to contribute anything to your combined life outside of a paycheque. \n\nNTA", "YWNBTA\n\nEnd the marriage when it doesn\u2019t get better. He clearly doesn\u2019t get his priorities straight.", "NTA \n\nIf you already tried to talk to him about this and he is not willing to spend time with you or helping with housework  you wont be happy in this marriage. \nMy boyfriend works a 9hr day i work 8hr too. We get things to work out in the house and still have time to play our Videogames seperately. If he would truly want to have things work out so both parts are happy, he would do it imo. \nBut in the end you need to know if you will be happy with the decision you make. \n\nI wish you the best of luck with whatever decision you make! Don't let anyone talk you down or take away your happieness:)", "NTA and WNBTA if you left.\n\nIt seems he doesn't appreciate you or even want to spend time with you, he just wants a maid to take care of him while he enjoys playing his games. The fact he thinks his work is more important shows you that he doesn't appreciate you and he thinks him working is an excuse not to do anything around the house.\n\nImagine what it would be like if/when kids are involved.\n\nKnow your worth and don't settle for less.", "NTA. You wouldn't be the first to leave a husband over video games, and this seems to just be part of a pattern of selfish behavior that you have described.", "Hell no you wouldn\u2019t.  Leave him! I\u2019m dealing with the same situation.", "no. your mom feels outwardly sexist because she believes that your work is not as difficult. i know different jobs are easier and harder, but if you can play that much games, just help a little around the house.", "NTA. He made a choice\u2026the games over you. \n\nI noticed he needs the game time after work, but he\u2019s more than happy to leave you the chores after your job. \n\nHe\u2019s a child. He wanted a maid/mother, not a partner. \n\nLeave him to his games. You deserve better.", "NTA; he\u2019s made his priorities clear and you\u2019re not one of them.  Good luck finding a better model!", "NTA\n\nHe clearly is addicted to videogames if all he does is work, eat, sleep and game while neglecting the rest of his life.\n\nYou are not ending the relationship because of videogames but because of an addiction.", "NTA he needs to do his share of the housework, not fair when you're both working for him to relax while you keep working.", "So at what point do you two have a relationship outside of \"waking up, going to work, coming home, then gaming, sleep, repeat\"? \n\nPerhaps once you pack your shit and leave, it will be real for him.  Or it won't, and he'll be too plugged into his alternate reality to notice you're gone.  Either way, it's time for you to get out of that and find someone that is interested in a relationship.  NTA.", "Let's be honest, you're not leaving your husband over video games, you're leaving your husband because he doesn't pay any attention to you, spend time with you or care about how you feel. This is not a partnership, it sounds more like you're raising a child. You can't change what other people do, but you can change whether you participate with it or not. NTA", "NTA\n\nHis job might be harder, but that doesn\u2019t excuse him from ignoring you. Fortunately, you\u2019re still young and didn\u2019t procreate with this dude. \n\nHopefully you find someone who doesn\u2019t make video games his entire life next time around.", "I'm glad you're packed and ready to go because there's only one AH here, and you're definitely NTA.\n\nINFO: did your spouse warn you in advance that he was actually looking for a maid and not a life partner?", "NTA. This was my marriage but kids added. Good for you for leaving now.", "I don't think you would be at all.  You sound more like a room mate with benefits than a spouse and he is putting in zero effort.  Are you sure you will even be missed?  I have a feeling as we move forward the reason for failed marriages because of video game is only going to rise.  NTA", "Have you talked to him?", "NTA I don\u2019t see any time in your husband\u2019s schedule that includes you. You can suggest counseling if that is something you are both willing to do. Otherwise if you are going to be practically alone you might as well end it and have less of a mess to clean up every day and engage with people who want to hang out with you.", "As a guy and gamer myself, NTA. Look we all have our hobbies and want to chill after work, doing our hobbies and just letting go.. But when you live with someone, you need to share in household responsibilities, especially when it's your FULL TIME WORKING spouse. You both work, you should divide household in 2 depending who's best at what. If you work and do all household chores and he works but does nothing at home, you are taking on way more than he is, it's an unfair amount of pressure on you.\n\nIf I were to work full time and do all household chores alone while my partner works same hours but does nothing, I'd rather live alone. Atleast I'm cleaning my own messes which are very small. Also don't hold it against your mum, she probably still has the old mentality of women cleaning the house like my mum, it's ok. But in the modern world where both work full time, both get the \"pleasure\" house chores and helping each other.", "NTA\n\nYou should not have to raise your husband.", "NTA.\n\nAlso, if you're an adult and live someplace, it's not \"helping out with the chores\" it's \"pulling your weight\" as an adult member of the household. Presently  he is not pulling his weight that way, and he is not contributing to your relationship either. The only things he's contributing are money (I hope), messes, and whining. If you don't need the first thing, you can sure as hell do with less of the last 2.", "That's not a marriage. At best, he's your roommate, at worst, your child. If you're not getting anything back in the relationship, you're making the right call.", "NTA. Anyone who spends so much time gaming, to the extreme detriment of their relationship with their wife, doesn't deserve a partner. Why would any man prefer to play video games rather than spend time with a woman who loves them? Tell your mother that he is a huge A H for not appreciating you or anything you do, which appears to be pretty much anything. I'd  be running away as quickly as possible and looking for someone who wants YOU. You deserve so much better.", "Okay, question. Are you ready to end your relationship with him?", "NTA. Unless his job is highly physical manual labour, he probably doesn't work harder than the average person", "NTA, whilst you maybe should of thought about this before marrying him, he needs to grow up and if he's not prepared to do so then you gotta do what you gotta do.", "Info: does he have any history of mental issues? I personally play a lot and used to play even more, mainly as a coping mechanism to a ton of other things. Therapy has helped bounds.\n\nEither way,, NTA. He has addiction issues but doesn't seem willing to work on them.", "NTA, You're not leaving your husband over video games, you're leaving your husband because he's inconsiderate, doesn't want to make his marriage work, doesn't want to spend time with his wife, doesn't want to help around the house.", "Well end of the day, none of this is new to you, even prior to getting married. It's something that didn't bother you enough not to get married.\n\nThat being said, you have a valid point. I would recommend marriage counseling at the very least prior, as changing someone's habits is neigh impossible unless it's on the precipice. That's simple human nature. \n\nAre you an asshole for it? A little, as you signed up for this prior. Shouldn't be obligated though to put up with it if it's really bothering you this much.", "ESH. He\u2019s an AH because he isn\u2019t listening to you and helping around the house as you ask, and you\u2019re the AH for wanting to jump ship instead of having serious conversations or therapy to try and help the marriage. Also, you married this man surely knowing he has this habit. It doesn\u2019t sound like his gaming just started overnight.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he isn't keeping up his side of things and being pretty self-centered, then you should get some distance and perhaps seek a marriage counselor if you believe the marriage is worth saving. If he refuses to go to a marriage counselor, then he has made his choice plain and simple.", "NTA. He seems determined to live a single life. Make his dream come true.", "NTA, he has an addiction and won't do anything about it. This addiction has already affected the relationship.", "YWNBTA in the least! I honestly wonder how long it'll take him to notice you're even gone. Probably when he's hungry and there's no one there to feed him. You were never his wife,  just his glorified maid. Good on you for leaving a boy who refuses to grow up and take responsibility for his own life.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ve never been in this position. I couldn\u2019t respect or be with a man who wasn\u2019t doing their share of the housework. I\u2019m after a partner. Not a child.", "I would kick his little ass into gear. He doesn\u2019t even exercise? Yuck, go get a real person who\u2019s grown. \n\nNTA, but he sure is", "NTA. Sounds like he wanted a mom, not a wife. He\u2019s forgotten your needs completely and has caved to main character syndrome. Cutting him loose would honestly be smarter now because it\u2019ll only get worse. And he\u2019ll normalize it until you can\u2019t tell how awful he\u2019s truly being. Run while you can.", "YTA.  Not because you want to leave your husband.  Because you wrote this:\n\n\"We've been married for two years, together for four. \"\n\nZero sympathy.  You chose your lifestyle, so you are an AH to complain about it now.", "He needs to help you with house chores. You clearly have a lot of negotiating to do in your relationship.\n\n\nBut for crying out loud you specifically chose to make a vow that you'd be with this man forever. So either you made that vow knowing what he was like (in which case this life was entirely your decision) or you made that vow so early in your relationship that you knew nothing about him (in which case you were premature and careless about getting married and this difficult situation is the fallout of that choice).\n\n\n\nEither way, you put yourself here and it's not a big enough problem that you can't work through it.", "You WNBTA but trying to repair things first could be a better option if possible.", "But also dont take video games as a hobby to be a deal breaker. Its more common than ever for adults to enjoy gaming and most of them would be offended at the idea they're a loser like your husband. \n\nMost adults who game treat it like any other hobby.", "Sounds like he has an addiction which he should treat.", "No, he absolutely did not.", "Several times throughout the whole relationship.", "She said she\u2019s leaving lol? She wants to know if she\u2019s right for leaving", "And she should just accept that she is married to a kid instead of a frikkin grown up that carries his own responsibilities as well???

At a friend's house, they offer you spinach to eat.  You eat it, and it makes you sick.  Will you be mad at the spinach now?  OP reports she was with her husband for two years before he was her husband.  When she agreed to marry him, she was saying that she accepts him JUST THE WAY HE IS.  Don't jump off the roof of your garage and then complain that you broke your leg.  That's an AH move there...", "Seriously. And who cares if it isn't new behavior? People are allowed to change their mind about what they want or find important. That poster just seems to think everyone should be happily resigned to misery.", "Doubt it. I\u2019m guessing if all she does it make a threat he won\u2019t take her seriously. She\u2019s gotta at least pack her bags and have them ready for him to see she\u2019s really going", "OP had multiple talks with her husband about his behaviour. She is allowed to be DONE with it. When you marry someone it is not a life contract for having to accept all your spouses shitty behaviour just because \"you need to accept someone the way they are\" your argument is complete BS.", "People don't change.  If you don't want to accept their shitty behavior, the logical thing to do is not get married.  If you do get married, don't complain that you married someone who you knew had shitty behavior.  Still no sympathy.\n\nI'm not saying the husband is perfect.  I'm saying his imperfections were PRETTY DAMN OBVIOUS before OP married him."]}
