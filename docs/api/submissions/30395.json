You offered to bring what you can, two pies (which I personally think are still fresh at just a couple days \u2018old\u2019!), and if he wants something else, he can pay you back so you have money for it. Also, imo potluck style isn\u2019t potluck if the \u201chost\u201d is just telling everyone exactly what they should bring. That\u2019s just shirking hosting duties.
