She was talking about having a baby soon. I lost my mind and told her to get off the phone so we can talk about this. This caused a huge argument. I was a teenage mother and I know how hard it is. She said her and her boyfriend (18 m) were ready and they both love kids. No matter what I said nothing was sinking in to her head. So I cooked up what I thought was a great plan with my cousin.\n\nMy cousin \u201cJade\u201d (35 f) has four kids aged 11, 8, 6 and 2. I\u2019d seen teenagers get sent to baby boot camp on TV shows like Maury and Dr Phil, and I thought I could do the same to my daughter to make her think twice about having kids so young. My daughter eventually agreed to spend the day at Jade\u2019s to help her with the kids, to see what it\u2019s really like. What Katie didn\u2019t know was that the kids had been told to be as badly behaved as possible. They were free to scream as much as they liked, have food fights, make mess, and run wild around the house (Jade explained to them it was a \u201cjoke to play on Katie\u201d) and the kids of course fully took advantage of this.\n\nI dropped Katie off at 7am, picked her up at 8pm. She was exhausted and stressed, exactly what I wanted. She even fell asleep in the car within minutes. I cannot believe how smug I felt on the way home.  \n\nAt breakfast the next day I asked her how it went, then she dropped the bombshell. She said she had now decided to never have children AT. ALL. She was deadly serious. She thanked me for the experience because she had now decided that having kids was not the life for her, and never would be. She started talking about getting her tubes tied and asked me if a doctor would do that at her age! I was completely shocked and I slowly realised the plan had worked too well. The plan was to put her off having children TEMPORARILY not completely make her hate them!  \n\nI tried to talk her out of it. I said having kids when your older is great and it\u2019s only a bad idea when you\u2019re too young. She wouldn\u2019t budge and said she has made up her mind, she hated every minute of looking after them and would never do that to herself. It killed me when she thanked me again. Katie is my only child and she is my only shot at grandchildren. But now I have completely shot myself in the foot. Even when I confessed to her the kids were told to act up, she wouldn\u2019t budge. Thanks to my stupid plan she has discovered these \u201cchildfree\u201d facebook groups and keeps showing me their obnoxious child hating posts.\n\nI half wish I had just let her have a baby at 19 now. It would be better than no grandchildren full stop. I didn\u2019t mean to make her hate children, I just wanted to stop her from having them TEMPORARILY. She gets angry at me every time I try to change her mind and steer her away from hating kids. I truly didn\u2019t mean for it to go this far.

She's her own person and her decision to have or not have children is hers to make. I think having kids at 19 was going to be a stupid idea but you should've shared your struggles, told her what the process could do to her body, gotten her on some kind of birth control, told her you wouldn't have helped with any kids she had this young, or you could have sent her over to watch those kids but had them behave like they normally do.

I don't know why so many people need to be taught this, but... **Just because you have a kid, it doesn't mean they owe you grandchildren.** You need to accept that instead of having that expectation of her, regardless of what decision she makes now or in the future. \n\nI understand that you tried to show her what the reality of having children is like, but this should've been a conversation or maybe talking to another person who had kids recently, not doing the extreme you did. *You weren't trying to give your daughter facts to help her make a decision, you were trying to manipulate her* and it backfired.

Sounds like this is for the best? I worked in a very, very difficult school in my early 20s. It opened my eyes to the realities of parenting. For me it didn't change my desire to be a parent one day it just adjusted the unrealistic expectations TV had given me, but many people decide to become parents without having ever been around kids and then are shocked. Blindsided by how hard parenting can get. And they end up resenting & regretting kids that never asked to be born. One of my parents was this person. Me & every single one of my siblings knew he regretted having us.

Do you really imagine you would have had any influence on that decision at all? My guess is that your daughter is now holding the long straw and letting you see the other side of your sick prank. Don't worry, she'll have the kids she wants to have, when she wants to have them.

Most 19-year-olds really don't fancy having kids.

Start being honest with her about your concerns and the prank you pulled, it might make a difference.

Then multiple at once... I think even had they moderately behaved there is a solid chance she'd feel the same way. Plus diapers, immense costs of feeding and clothing, healthcare, and more.", "NTA for the reality check, but you need to back off at this point. She\u2019ll make her mind up the way everyone else does - she\u2019ll either have an unplanned pregnancy or not! Lol sorta joking, but I doubt you\u2019ve scarred her for life.", "This is the perfect example for this statement", "Yeah she had a great opportunity to have an honest discussion with her daughter which could\u2019ve strengthened their bond and shown Katie that she can go to her mother for anything.

This was your own fault Op.", "Wasn't something similar to this posted here last week? A wife and her sister cooked up a plan to teach the husband a lesson as he wanted kids and the wife didn't?", "Honestly I hope this fails and she kinda sticks to no kids if that\u2019s what she wants now.\n\nBeing tricked into something and now again being manipulated into a different direction?\n\nI hope the daughter discovers what she really wants, and goes with it regardless what OP wants or says.\n\nBeing a puppet and being orchestrated is like one of the worst feelings out there imo.", "Oh come on! She tried to control her daughter and broke her mentally?! Way to be over dramatic. She didn't tell her what to do. She gave advice, like any mother gives to a 19 year old. She also gave her an opportunity to be around kids (and yes, they shouldn't have been told to act up, but OP admitted to it later as a misjudgement). It's not mentally destroying someone by giving them a day with children, in a safe space with a parent around.\n\nOf course it's not a good idea for a 19 year old to have a baby. Most 19 year olds are not self sufficient and can't handle it. The daughter sounds the same. Just because it's a possible life choice doesn't make it a good one. Plus god knows when she struggles, OP will have to pick up the pieces, so it impacts them too.\n\nI'm still young but god, I understand why people call us snowflakes when I read stuff like this.", "Exactly what I thought, she\u2019s screwing with her mother. OP leave her alone now, just drop it.", "I was about to say the same thing.  I bet she figured out that she was set up and decided to teach you a lesson by now proclaiming to be eternally child-free.", "Just because a person likes kids does not mean they will want their own. I love my nieces and have had numerous good experiences with them, still doesn't change my mind about having my own.", "It can also be argued that her mother\u2019s manipulation is very harmful", "No this is not a reality check. Having a child is difficult, hard and require a lot of responsibility and work. But nobody is forced to have 4kids and not parenting them. \n\nA reality check would have seat her down and show her the average year expense of having a child.", "Did you apologize when you did so? There is a huge difference between 'hey it's not entirely realistic and we told the kids to act up to show you what it could be' and 'honey, I'm sorry I messed up. We told the kids to act up because I was afraid you would make a decision you would regret. I realize I abused the trust you had in me. Can we discuss how we go from here?'", "Do you have the link?", "If they hadn't told the children to intentionally behave their worst and children can be fucking terrible if they do - I'd agree with you, but for that scenario, it is more than likely some things were also said that were just terrible.\n\nThe girl clearly seems to be genuinely done that she wants nothing to do with kids anymore. And I also said with the intention of doing it - because what she did was intentionally to go after what her daughter believed in and wanted to do, revolving around her mentally and intentionally creating a fake scenario that was meant to torture her throughout the whole babysitting session. No mother with their first child knows everything, but you learn and she was put in a situation where she had no fair chance to calm the kids down.\n\nEspecially if you consider the mothers inspiration, Dr Phil, who is known for supporting a troubled teen industry company that has been on the rags for a teen murdering a staffer in an attempt to escape. Not good inspiration.\n\nShe was actively trying to control her daughters choices and body. If she were to only give advice and give her an example, then I'd also agree with you, but she didn't. Giving an example does not mean showing her the worst kids can be, but maybe \"Hey, look at this person who had a child at your age and what she had to endure\", because there are many people who talk about their experience as a young parent, online... And that very sternly talk about the difficulties and how for some, it destroyed their life and that they also thought \"It's not gonna happen to me.\"\n\nThere is a difference between just trying to make her daughter face the difficulties as a young mother versus putting her in a situation she was bound to lose no matter what she does, which is not realistic most of the time as a parent and I can confidently say that as someone who was a literally awful teen to the point that I almost got into a criminal career.", "My ex would gush over small children and how cute they are but absolutely NEVER wanted to have kids. He's 40 now and hasn't budged on the idea.", "I will have to agree to disagree with you. In my opinion, it was wrong for the mother to ask the kids to act up, but she wasn't in a terrible situation. She wasn't left alone with the children. She wasn't left in harms way. She was left to experience children at their worst, with their parent present. It was hardly mental torture.\n\nGiving advice is not always listened to and I say this as someone who used to be a 19 year old girl. Seeing reality and learning through actions is way more effective. Sometimes teenagers don't listen without experience. So I see why OP didn't want to just leave it to 'I don't think that's a good idea' as their daughter probably wouldn't listen until it's too late, they have a child and OP is lumbered with looking after them. Just like I'm sure we've all been told to study hard for an exam but didn't actually do it until it had negative real life consequences! And even then, it probably didn't motivate us until it went too far.\n\nI don't care for Dr Phil either. It doesn't mean that exposure isn't a practical option, which the daughter was fully on board with. The acting up is the only issue, which was admitted to and owned up to. I guess I just see that as a misjudgement and you view that as mental harm, so we won't agree.", "That's fair to agree to disagree, I guess it depends on what you view in general, too. To me it can be possible some form of mental torture if you know they're there, but they don't do anything and you have children of different ages do everything they want. That went way too far and might have genuinely made the daughter thing \"That's how they all are, at all times\".\n\nI just feel like they were better eductional ways she could have taken to get her point across, I feel like the bigger impacts of very young pregnancies are kids left in adoption centers actually. Like, *\"What if you have your kid, but you realize it's too much? I want to show you what would happen\"* and take her there to see how much misery it is. Actualy in real life examples of the consequences instead of showing the worst of kids every parent has to deal with, no matter when they get a kid.\n\nI think it genuinely just lead to the daughter hating everything around kids now until she gets shown they're not always like that.", "Honestly, I think she's 19 and may grow out of it. If one day can make her change her mind, then she wasn't so set on becoming a Mum in the first place. She just needs time to process and get good experiences too. It sounds like she hasn't had those to balance her view, but then I don't know why she thought she was ready for kids.\n\nI agree that seeing adoption centres could be a good shout. But I think the reality is that most teen parents dump their kids on their parents. And they know it. Just like I know that I need to try my best in life, but it I screw up, my parents will probably still save me. So even then, I'm not sure how effective it would be as the daughter may think that an adoption centre isn't the reality for her future kids. I think the daughter just needs to spend more time with children, maybe babysitting or helping out (without them purposing acting up). Or maybe she just needs time.", "I agree with that for sure. It just depends on her state of mind though, maybe OP might never become grandkids lol But we won't know for sure unless there is an update down the line, a few years later most likely.\n\nAnd yea, tasking her with babysitting and helping out without the drama might have done the magic of her realising it takes more than just \"Eat and sleep, my child\"."]}
