We didn\u2019t grow up together and would only probably see each other once a year as kids unless in the event of a wedding, funeral and ect. We live eight hours apart from one another and rarely kept in contact. \n\nNow that we are adults we see each other even less and still live eight hours apart he has come to my town and not even contacted me to catch up, so when I got an invitation to his engagement party I was quite surprised, I rsvp that I was going but on the day before I was meant to leave for the engagement party I found out I was pregnant and had to cancel so I could get tests done to confirm my pregnancy. I called my cousin to inform him of the situation which he was very understanding of but his fianc\u00e9 was not, she was angry that they had lost money because of me, I offered to pay them what they had lost and my cousin refused. \n\nFast forward a year an invitation was sent to me for my cousin\u2019s wedding and the first thing I noticed was that the wedding was In three months from when I received the invitation and at the bottom was that children are not to attend. I called my cousin and asked if they knew of anyone that they trusted that would possibly be able to babysit during the wedding, because I wasn\u2019t going to travel eight hours away from my baby for multiple nights and all my family would be at the wedding that lived close by him. \n\nI got a message from his soon to be wife telling me that i choose to have a baby it\u2019s my responsibility to find someone to care for it and that they are too busy planning a wedding to care about silly things like children. I got so mad and just decided to make it easy for everyone and just rsvp that I won\u2019t attend, to which I guess made her mad so she told my Aunty and grandma what had happened and now they are calling me everyday trying to pressuring me into going and leaving my baby at home because it\u2019s going to be such a special day for my cousin and he will want all his family their to celebrate with him. \n\nAm I over reacting for not wanting to go? I don\u2019t want special treatment or a free pass to take my child, I respect their wishes to have a child free wedding, all I asked was a little help to find a trusted babysitter for my baby. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1691038728, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15guhxi/aita_for_not_going_to_my_cousins_wedding_because/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are not obligated to attend a wedding.

No one is the AH here. This just is where the cards fall.

I can't understand what's this with inviting people you never even talk to, and then get angry when they refuse. And it's not even the cousin who's mad, but his future wife, who has probably seen you no more than 5 times in her life.", "NTA \nthey dont want you and your family there.\n\nEveryone who set up a child free wedding knows that many parents wont attend.\n\nJust ignore them an enjoy your live without people like that around you.", "NTA.\n\nBeing semi distant cousins, the invite to the engagement party sounds more like family just including family. Your cousin probably has no hurt feelings if you choose to not go from the start.  \nIt seems like when you had to remove your rsvp, the bride to be chose to be petty angry about money, rather than happy for your pregnancy. Having her continue petty stuff is making you feel like you did something wrong, which you did not. \n\nSend a congrats card and forget about the bride.", "This SHOULD be N-A-H, as in anyone is welcome to have a childfree wedding, and anyone is welcome to choose not to attend because it's childfree.\n\nHowever, the bride is pitching a hissy fit and involving family.

Shouldn't she be too busy planning a wedding to care about a silly thing like that?\n\nThe subject of your wedding attendance is now closed as you have RSVPed with a polite no.  Anyone who calls to talk about it can be informed that the subject is closed.  If they continue to talk about it, you can hang up on them.\n\nYes, you can even hang up on grandma.

You don\u2019t really have a relationship with your cousin or even met the bride. This should be easy for them not to care. You had a good reason for not going to the engagement party & even offered to pay for you missing it. You did the right thing by rsvping no.

You didn't ask to bring the baby, you asked if they had recommendations for childcare since you're going to their location.

Needing childcare should have been assumed, most folks wouldn't want a newborn or toddler at their wedding.", "NTA - people can have childfree weddings and people whose children are excluded can not go - it\u2019s as simple as that. You are never the asshole for not going to an event because you can\u2019t take your children. It is nobody\u2019s business than yours why - its your choice.", "NTA\n\nI see a lot of AITA posts about brides and grooms expecting people to comply with all their wedding wishes because it\u2019s \u2018their special day\u2019. When in reality, if you make your wedding a pain for your guests, you can\u2019t blame them if they decide not to attend. Just respect their decision and give their invite to someone else who didn\u2019t make the original wedding guest list.\n\nMy cousin didn\u2019t come to my wedding because he has social anxiety and wanted to play golf instead\u2026 and fair play to him!", "NTA...She didn't arrange for childcare which a lot of couples do. She doesn't know of anyone that can watch your little one and frankly got nasty when you asked. \n\nYou honestly tried to go but due to the circumstances of the wedding it's frankly not possible. Getting your Aunt and Grandma involved was basically a AH move. Next time they say something I'd ask them if when the Groom and Aunt (for Grandma) were that little would they leave them. When they are that small you could miss something at any time.", "NTA.  You were willing to attend and asked a reasonable question as to childcare services in their area.  The wife to be is a bloody nightmare, your family are ridiculous.  I think they'll find that very, very few mums would bugger off for the wedding of someone they aren't close to and leave their young baby at home for days.  With the maelstrom of shitstorm that seems to have kicked up, in your position I'd stick to my guns and just not go.", "NTA \n\nShe made herself clear when you asked about childcare arrangements, they don\u2019t have time to help you.
