I feel it's beyond the scope of reddit.", "NTA, but she is for taking from you without asking and your mom *definitely* is for letting this all happen.

If and when your sister stops sucking, she\u2019ll get over it.", "NTA and I dont get these ESH comments because she clearly went with intent to destroy, she may be autistic but that is no excuse, and it sounds like she is just using it as one to get away from everything.", "NTA\nOh my god I don\u2019t know what would come out of my mouth if my sister ruined my Poscas.

Because if she didn't, while you are blamed for your reaction to her behaviour it's clear who the golden child is", "This is a tricky one, but I'm going to say ~~E S H~~ **NTA**, based on your additional comments.  (See edit note below.)\n\nFirst, let me say that I understand your anger.  I don't believe your sister when she says she didn't know not to use your new markers because she's autistic.  Clearly, that's not how her autism presents.  If she's able to understand social rules well enough to have friends at her age, then she's well enough to know that you ask before you use other people's things. Also, considering that she destroyed them, I think her actions were very deliberate.\n\nThat being said, as justified as your anger is, you shouldn't say things as wild as \"I wish you were never born\" over destroyed markers.  You're 16.  \n\nI'm still sorry your gift was destroyed.  I think your sister needs to buy your a new set, and I think you should apologize for your harsh language.\n\n**Edit:** Given the information gleaned from OP's comments that her mother \"doesn't do punishment\" and that her sister has a history of destroying her things, I'm changing my vote to NTA.", "NTA- it sounds like your sister is terrible and your mom allows it all to happen.  Is there any way you can stay with your dad?", "NTA. It seems like your sister has been the center of attention her entire life and you\u2019ve constantly felt second-place. Now the one thing you\u2019re starting to take pride in and excel at, your sister essentially ruins is. To everyone saying they\u2019re just markers, that\u2019s not the issue - it was a gift from her father which, from the post, she doesn\u2019t get that often. Her sister knew that and somehow destroyed an entire set within a day. Autism isn\u2019t an excuse for that - at 13 years old you know how to use a marker or any coloring item. Should you have said what you said? No, but I understand where the resentment is coming from", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut it is not your sister, your mom is the AH.", "NTA. Your sister tried to use her autism against you. I don\u2019t think she would be able to tell you that she doesn\u2019t understand what she\u2019s doing if she truly didn\u2019t understand. Your mother excusing her behavior is unfair. And your mother seems to be picking sides. Very unfair situation. Not letting you eat with them? Very weird", "NTA", "You are a teenager experiencing a difficult situation of favoritism and an entitled sibling. It isn't easy and you have a tough road ahead of you. \n\nAs far as what you said, yes it was an asshole move but I'm guessing that what you said had a small amount of honesty in it. In which case, my advice is therapy. Don't let this resentment turn into anger and self-sabotage. Learning how to deal with entitled people and not reacting is practically a job skill at this point. So ask for forgiveness, forgive yourself and find someone to talk to. Also, this won't be the last time, she destroys something of yours, so be prepared to protect anything of value (on your own) especially since it seems that your mom isn't going to back you up.", "She understands; believe me, she understands.", "You're right, it's not an excuse.", "Nta, it's difficult enough to be your age - nevermind having a shit family.", "NTA.\nThe question is not 'was that the best thing to say,' the questions is 'are you an AH' and as far as I can see you ain't.\n\nNot clear to me why your mom doesn't see this incident as a problem that requires some kind of redress.", "NTA.", "NTA. Having been tot he point of total frustration and mystery where you have to wish someone didn't exist and say it, I understand you. I also have the same markers and they are sturdy as hell. She intentionally ruined your stuff.\n\nMaybe be smarter about it in the future tho, because the consecuenses of saying something this strong are not worth it imo.", "NTA. What you said was harsh but you\u2019re still a kid. What she did was deliberate and calculated. As an autist myself, anyone who uses their disorder as an excuse knows what they did wrong but hide behind the guise of not knowing better. Your mom needs to nip this in the butt right away or your sister will be in for a very rude awakening.", "Little bit of ESH\n\nSaying you wish she wasn\u2019t born is really harsh, and they\u2019re words that you can\u2019t take back. \n\nShe\u2019s an AH for using your stuff without asking first. I get your mum is angry at you (and you kinda made it worse with the telling her to F herself) but she should get sister to replace the pens. 1)Because she shouldn\u2019t have been touching your stuff and 2)You only got them last month. You\u2019ve barely got use out of them and now they\u2019re ruined. \n\nUnless your mum has a history of favouring your sister, you should have left it to her to discipline her.\n\nEdit: Reading back on it, I can tell there\u2019s a lot of jealousy on your side for how easy she\u2019s going through school and life, and because her dad can pay for it, she\u2019s given more opportunities. And that she gets the better presents and all that jazz. While I don\u2019t condone what you said to her, I am more on your side for the fact you had something nice for once, for something that you\u2019re actually good at and she\u2019s destroyed it. And I have serious trouble believing that she didn\u2019t know what she was doing. It gives off the feel that she\u2019s jealous that you were good at one thing she\u2019s not, so she decided to hurt you. I just feel bad for your that you\u2019re getting the punishment more while she\u2019s also done something wrong.", "NTA. You\u2019re young and you\u2019re frustrated. It\u2019s a lot to handle as a teen. The AH is your mom who needs to do a better job of looking out for both of her kids. She needs to protect you too.", "NTA autism is worn like a badge of honor and if there was a cure, most people wouldn't want it since it would take away from the attention the receive. Evidently, history needs rewritten since like likes of Einstein and Tesla being the geniuses they also had to be autistic. The medical industry created autism as a modern day cash cow.", "NTA\n\nYou had every right to be furious about the destruction of your expensive markers and your sister's refusing to take responsibility for it. I don't blame you for blowing up. It was a bit harsh telling her you wish she's never been born, but I can understand why you said it. You've lived with years of your mom's favoritism toward your sister, and your sister's destructiveness. \n\nIs it possible for you to go live with your father? You shouldn't have to live with your sister's destructiveness and excuses, nor your mother's favoritism. You might at least ask your dad to have a talk with your mother about the situation. \n\nIf not, you should insist on getting a lock for your bedroom door. And a locking box of some sort for your markers, if they ever get replaced. Your mother absolutely should replace those.", "NTA", "NTA and she owes you new markers.", "NTA, you went a bit overboard though. You can only control your own behavior, not hers. It would be best to apologize for your part and take the high road. She should definitely have to buy you a brand new, better set of markers as well. Good luck, only a couple more years.", "NTA. Your mother is a giant fucking asshole. So is your sister.\n\n\nTime to plan bailing out eventually.", "I'm going to say NTA, your reaction wasn't exactly mature but you are 16 and have ADHD, you deserve some leeway. Plus I'm fairly certain that high-functioning as she is, your sister knew you wouldn't want her to use your markers and she did it anyway. Sometimes a blunt angry reaction is all a person like this understands. \n\nWhen it all blows over, you can probably explain to her that you spoke out of anger and you didn't really mean it (unless you seriously did, to which I'm going to say your feelings are your feelings and it will explain why you go no contact in the future) but she has to understand that you have boundaries and she can't cross them just because she feels like she can.", "NTA. What you said was harsh, but you're 16. Your mother sounds like a fucking nightmare. I'd be calling up your dad if you can.", "NTA. Her diagnosis isn't an excuse for ruining your stuff. You need a safe or foot locker to store your stuff in. They have them at Walmart. Maybe you can get your Dad to get you one with a good lock so you can store your stuff where she can't get to your stuff since her \"Autism\" makes her ruining your stuff. Glad you have something that you like doing that works with your ADHD.  I bet you are talented.", "NTA\n\nI'm autistic and I don't use that as an excuse to get whatever I want. it's your items and you should be able to express your feelings accordingly if it is destroyed. which it was. Siblings fight all the time and say that kind of stuff, nothing new here tbh.", "NTA her diagnosis especially at her age is not t an excuse. You may have been a little harsh with your choice of words, however, if art is your thing then those markers were extremely important to you and your mother should have some compassion for you. Talk to your Dad about what happened", "NTA\nI honestly if you're a functioning person with autism and not mute or disabled completely then autism is literally no excuse. This isnt Gilbert Grape you dont have to put up w that.", "NTA, it's not an excuse, and this is coming from someone with autism. She did it out of malicious intent.

That doesn't mean they're not A Hs in the process.", "OP, you should really add this to the post, as well as the detail about your mom's inability to parent, i.e. the fact that she \"doesn't do punishment.\"\n\nI voted ESH, but I didn't know these details until later.", "There's a military term that applies here that anyone with a sibling should understand: Mutually Assured Destruction.  The idea is that we don't bomb Russia because they can bomb us back.  If everyone dies, it doesn't matter who started the war, why it was fought, or who \"won.\" \n\nI wouldn't have launched an attack on my brother because he would aggressively retaliate.  He broke my bicycle by driving over hillls of dirt and landing too hard...so I accidentally donated his favorite cassettes to our churches garage sale.  He vandalized my room and I made sure my parents found out he let his friends bring alcohol over and have a few drinks while they were away for a weekend.  \n\nYour sister will keep attacking you because there's no cost.  Her parents don't discipline her.  She seems to comfortably feel that she can keep acting this way and emerge the victor.\n\nInside the bounds of the law with no injuries, how can you convince her not to mess with you?   How can you make her hesitate before she touches your stuff again?", "Well, if she\u2019s never been appropriately disciplined for those actions, I can see why you said what you did. \n\nSometimes people deserve to have their feelings hurt, this is one of those times. She\u2019s a spoiled brat who needs to be taken down a peg or ten but the truly useless one here is your mother.", "What have your parents done about this if it's clearly a pattern?", "Start billing her Dad. Send him an itemized list of things she deliberately broke.", "OP, are you at all able to talk to a counselor or therapist about this? Because while what\u2019s going on involving her and your parents isn\u2019t right, your reaction here along with what you\u2019re saying is concerning. Genuinely.\n\nI have dealt with things similar to what you describe, but the fact you\u2019re saying this stuff is seriously worrying. Please get help.", "Please edit this part into the post, critical info man!", "Can you go live with your dad? Courts will take your opinion into account at your age. If not, get a lock for your door.", "I had missed that part - and as someone with ADHD myself they're different and regarded differently even when they can be cousins as far as symptoms go, depending on the person, for sure. It does sound like the parents are making excuses and out of the ESH in terms of decent behavior, they're the biggest AH by far for being the adults and still playing favorites/using autism as a catch-all excuse/spoiling one kid and neglecting and disrespecting the other.", "Someone doing something age appropriate does not mean that what they did is acceptable or excusable. When an 18 month old is hitting others we know that that\u2019s part of what toddlers do but we still make efforts to protect others from being hit even if our only intervention is interrupting the behavior and redirecting to a healthier behavior.", "That's exactly like using a disability as an excuse. This is \"Am I the asshole\" not \"do I act like other people my age.\" Teenagers = cats.", "Yeah, I\u2019ve been reading through the comments and seeing how this is more than just the markers.\n\nI definitely know how it feels, having had serious emotional regulation issues myself especially as a teen, and I do have sympathy for OP. It is a shitty situation to be in. However, she is not blameless, even with emotional regulation being difficult. Those words carry a lot of weight and I find it concerning that OP seems to genuinely believe in them rather than it being a heat of the moment thing.\n\nBut I absolutely agree that mom is an AH- I\u2019d argue she\u2019s the biggest AH for this. Her parenting skills are clearly poor, given how this is even something that\u2019s happened in the first place. It\u2019s almost like she\u2019s trying to turn these two against each other. I really hope OP can find someone to talk to about what\u2019s going on at home.", "Natural consequences work in this situation. The natural consequence to your sister destroying your thing is that she work to pay to replace them. Whether that is selling something of hers, doing work around the house to earn extra money or something. But having her have no consequence is not a natural consequence for this.", "Your mom \"doesn't do punishment\"?  I'm sorry, but that's crazy.\n\nHonestly, I'm ~~a little more~~ totally on your side now.\n\n**Edit:** turns out the sister also habitually destroys OP's things.", "You're NTA.  You're if your sister is acting the way you described with being spoiled etc... I can only imagine the stuff you have to put up with because of her condition.    Your mom should have some understanding of why you are as angry as you are.  And she should be helping the situation not victim blaming.   You could also say \"my condition makes me say things I don't mean\" which is the excuse your sister used basically.  If anyone is the real ah here it's your mom.", "How did she even react to this words ? I'm Autistic and evne thought I know it is wrong and rude what you said , It never bothered me  personally when ppl said  such stuff to me and I also understand not to destroy someones proberty . What still bothers me being unable to really connect to others and being understood . And I'm pretty sure ppl will say I'm wrong because saying such stuff to someone else is so harsh. Maybe but the real question is how many friends does your sis have? How many connections does she have . Does she feel like part of the community ? You may think she is happy because she is able to do more than you but is she really happy ?", "[deleted]", "So that makes it okay to tell a 13 year old girl with autism you wish she\u2019d never been born?", "I'm sorry.", "NTA but how did she break a lockbox? If I were you I would look into getting full custody with your dad. You\u2019re 16 and most courts a willing to put a bit more favor into the opinion of a 16 year old when it comes to which parent the live with.", "The sister\u2019s affluent father can replace them. The mother is T real A, here.", "You'd OP to be bitter towards her sister for, dare I say, OBVIOUS favoritism", "It doesn't matter the punishment history - you shouldn't tell your 13 year old sister that you wish she was never born. OP may be a slightly justified AH, but she's an AH for saying that.", "Oh man, you just unlocked a core memory here. When my  dad(powerlifter/bodybuilder) would wake us up to do stuff on the weekend would literally fold our mattresses like tacos and carry us into the living room if we didn't wake up the first time, or shake us like an earthquake was happening... Anywho, yep that was us \"you taught us how to make shadow puppets, you have no power here\". Then my mom literally took the lightbulbs out of my room LOL", "Yeah I see your point but if I was OP I probably would have rather ate in my room then with them anyway after all that.", "But... those are different comments?", "Good bot", "I misread that as \u201caromatic\u201d, and I wondered if I was that behind on sexual orientations that that one totally missed me.", "https://www.thegirlfriend.com/lifestyle/3-incredible-women-know-probably-dont", "Aromatic is a room freshener.

She's discussed it in interviews before. Relax.", "More importantly, why are people bothered by her being a lesbian?\n\nAnd to answer your question:\n\nBecause I said it. And I meant to say it. And if that's a problem for some, too damn bad. Muting and moving on.", "Nobody's upset she's a lesbian, they're just pointing out that mentioning her sexuality when it's not relevant reinforces heteronormativity.", "Basically this. The Iranian yogurt isn\u2019t the problem here.", "I think me and my siblings told each other that on monthly basis. We're fucked up, but that's not why.", "I understand where you're coming from but if her sister has been raised to think it's never her fault/her disorder will get her a free pass I worry it'll just increase her shitty behavior and make everything worse. The parents are causing this issue in a big, big way and they need to be taken to task, maybe by intervention of a therapist who specializes in these issues. (But like...a competent one, I know there's all kinds of debate over what treatment to give to a person with autism and wouldn't want to invite some more abusive practices in.)", "Sometimes siblings or classmates can be harsher \u201cdisciplinarians\u201d than parents or teachers when it comes to enforcing proper behavior", "Apparently OP's Mom \"doesn't do punishment,\" so probably nothing at all.", "I would agree with that! Even if the dads contribute differently, there's no reason to treat the kids differently in terms of time/attention/respect - and neurodiverse folks might take that inequity especially hard. (As someone else with ADHD who can get really wound up about injustice!)", "She is an abused teen. We can give her a pass at saying something mean to her tormentor. If sister understands possession (indicated by the fact that she has her own shampoo that she doesn't share) and she has the social acuity to participate in sports with rules,  she understood what she was doing while destroying the markers.", "Yes, that's what I said /s \ud83d\ude44\n\nNo, OBVIOUSLY. But they aren't \"just markers\". It's expensive, it's meaningful, it was her property. I was giving context in case you didn't realize those things.

She was already spoiled", "Except when she clearly punished OP. This is just such transparent favoritism", "You're missing the point entirely. My daughter ate in her room most of the time, drove me mad because the crockery was a whole lot slower to come back down lol. But MAKING someone eat in solitude as a punishment? Wrong.", "Yeah I guess it could make you feel excluded if it was used as punishment but as an only child I just can't relate. I didn't fight a whole lot with my parents and I had no siblings to fight with.", "I hear ya, I don't disagree.", "Christ on a unicycle.", "Ohh, I see now. Damn bots are getting clever on us.", "Yeah, good catch.  Since when is eating dinner alone a natural consequence of mouthing off to your little sister?  My sisters and I mouthed off at eachother all day long; we weren't banished from communal dinner.", "Oh I see your point, I was just expressing my surprise because that would not have seemed like a punishment in my family unless we were having some kind of family get together. Wasn't trying to say it couldn't be a punishment."]}
