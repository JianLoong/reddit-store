That's an issue for your dad and his girlfriend to figure out, he can do the math just as well as you can. You're almost certainly not bringing up anything he hasn't already considered himself, and if it's not something he wants to do, it's only going to make your relationship with him and his girlfriend worse because it's a hell of an accusation to even bring it up.", "YWBTA. Don't do this.\n\nYour dad not only knows his girlfriend better than you do, he is just as capable of putting two and two together as you are.\n\nIf he believes there is a possibility the baby is not his, and if that's going to be a problem for him, he is perfectly capable of making the decision to get a DNA test. It's really not your business.", "YTA - sometimes people can have fertility issues without knowing why. Saying your mom bad 4 kids so she couldn\u2019t have been the problem but your dad also had you two - so it\u2019s not really proving either are having issues.\n\nI\u2019m sure you dont know the full details of what they did to TTC.\n\nLet it go.", "Don\u2019t do it.

It is likely to upset him, and strain your relation, but you wouldn't be an asshole for trying to prevent situation where he would potentially raise not his child unknowingly. \n\nKeep in mind it will come off as rude to him, but if you have his best interest in mind you should do it.

Maybe he's not super fertile and she's hyperfertile and the odds just worked in their favour.", "Fertility issues can also be temporary both in men and women.", "OP should also consider the possibility that the dad is entirely infertile, and is not OP's bio father either. Whatever understanding he and OP's mother had, and he and the new gf have, is between them.

Dad may never have been able to conceive children.", "That would actually work.", "I would like to add that if your dad has been fertile before, unless he got a vasectomy, it isn't really possible for him to become infertile. Men don't experience menopause like women do.", "What?", "Yes, but the issue is not \"Should he get a DNA test?\", but \"Should OP be the one to advise him to get a DNA test?\"\n\nPeople have been commenting along the lines of \"Don't *tell* him, just tactfully suggest it\". But there is no tactful way of suggesting it. You can try to put it delicately, but every way you frame the suggestion, the underlying meaning will always be \"Your girlfriend might be cheating on you, so you'd better check to make sure\".\n\nAnd I would argue that the girlfriend's fidelity is not OP's business. Even hinting at the possibility that OP's father is not the baby's father could be enough to damage OP's relationship with her father.\n\nIf the issue were something her father could not possibly be aware of, then perhaps it could be argued that OP has a responsibility to tell him. But this isn't such an issue. This is just OP's suspicions, and her father is perfectly capable of figuring things out for himself.", "Sorry, old joke.", "\u201d I thought my vasectomy would stop future pregnancies, apparently it just changes the babies color\u201d -unknown"]}
