This is my first serious relationship, and I have ADHD. Just in case that matters.\n\nI am posting this here before I say anything because with my ADHD it's difficult to tell if this is just amazingly dumb, and hurtful.\n\nSo when we were dating, we obviously talked about the dogs, and I told her that while I loved dogs, and grew up with them I had not wanted to get my own dog because of the responsibilities of constantly taking them for walks etc. She said it was her dogs and I wouldn't be \"allowed\" to walk them anyways because of some behaviour difficulties with two of the dogs.\n\nNow that we have moved in together, it's one of the things she constantly nags me about. That I don't take them for walks on my own accord. Mind you, I do offer. For me the issue for her seems to be that I don't *think* about their need to be walked. If I offer I get shut down and told that she'll do it herself, and when I don't offer and just go about my normal morning routine she will make some comment about how I don't care about the dogs or her.\n\nAs an addition to this, about a month ago she took in another dog. Her grandmothers dog, and keep saying she'll keep the dog. This without asking me. I figured as long as she takes cares of them herself, she can do whatever. But now we're up to 4 dogs.\n\nEvery time she says I don't care about the dogs or her I get incredibly hurt, because to me it feels so unfair. I offer to walk them and she refuses, and if I don't I'm an asshole. I can't win. And my true impression was that she would do all the dog stuff herself. I love her, but this truly exhausts me.\n\nI'm so tired of being called selfish when I don't take them for walks, because it's not that I don't care - I just honestly believed it would be her responsibility, and that she would ask me if I needed to help, which would require me to get up earlier to not miss work, which again - I would do but she seems to not want me to do that, but also tell me off for not doing it. I feel so helpless. Now I'm just considering telling her that the dogs are her responsibility, not mine. And she's not allowed to tell me off for not caring. She can ask for help if she wants it, but other than that I will turn my brain off when it comes to the dogs. Would I be the asshole if I did that? I get that there are certain things that is completely lost to me with me having ADHD, so any feedback would be appreciated.\n\nTL:DR: Would I be the asshole for telling my girlfriend that her dogs are her responsibility alone, and that she's not allowed to tell me off for not taking them for walks when she doesn't ask me to?", "created_utc": 1673435006, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10922v4/aita_if_i_told_my_girlfriend_that_her_dogs_are/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Be very carefull, not saying you should end the relationship since i don't know how the rest of your relationship is, but she is playing with your anxieties, and that is a bad sign", "NTA you set perfectly reasonable boundaries for the relationship, that being you didn't want to be responsible for the dogs. You do offer when you feel able and she decides to dump on your boundaries by criticizing you for not taking care of them? No not ok.", "NTA. And her behaviour is wrong.", "NTA. She wants two separate things that don't meet in the middle. She wants to be in absolute control (which she's failing at, given the behavioral difficulties) but she also wants help because she's failing.\n\nYou've been dealt an unwinnable hand, my guy", "NTA, not your dogs, not your problem.  \nShe's an adult, she choose the responsibility of 4 dogs \\[that's a lot!!\\] so now she has to stick with it.   \nThe only error you made was moving with her while she already had her 3 dogs, you should've know what was coming... and didn't you say anything when she took the 4th?  \nADHD has nothing to do here with the situation. Tell her it's not your responsibility.", "NTA. You told her from the start you don\u2019t want dogs bc of the responsibility. Maybe you should have had another conversation when you moved in about the dogs. Stop offering to walk them, tell her you\u2019ve discussed that they are her responsibility. If she continues to treat you that way, move out.", "Absolutely NTA. The title makes it seem like you are, but you are genuinely trying to help out. Partners that only give you the double edged sword are toxic partners by constantly making you feel you\u2019re doing no good. \n\nYour ADHD doesn\u2019t make you disabled (I also have it btw), you\u2019re just as good as she is. It\u2019s time for you to have a serious discussion with her and stick up for yourself.", "NTA\n\nBut there are many red flags and toxic behaviour there.\n\nIt's not ok to expect your partner to do things that you explicitly told them they won't be doing. It is also not ok to have those weird expectations of hers, and to shut down your offers to help because they aren't in the format she wants. It is unclear what she expects. If you offer to walk the dogs, you think about their need.\n\nIt's not ok to bring in pets or people into a home without getting an ok from your partner first. It's not ok to get a new pet without getting an ok from your partner first.\n\nThis is not a matter of you communicating clearly or establishing boundaries. Your gf doesn't communicate, breaks your boundaries and is expecting you to break the boundaries she established because apparently she doesn't want that anymore.\n\nNote that while you said you didn't want responsibility, her reaction was \"I'm not even offering you that responsibility to begin with\", and that was your agreement with her.\n\nI strongly advise you to find a new girlfriend.", "NTA just go ahead and talk that talk.", "NTA, this seems simple, your girlfriend shouldn't get mad at you for not reading her mind and doing stuff you've probably never done before.", "NTA. You were clear with her around your thoughts at the beginning. Additionally, it is not ok that she took on another dog without even asking you. You need to agree clear responsibilities and boundaries around the dogs, because this emotional blackmail will otherwise go on for years", "NTA.\n\nSeems like she's overwhelmed by the responsibility of having so many dogs (especially if 2 have behavior issues) and has decided to take it out on you despite you doing nothing wrong. \n\nHer 3 dogs are undeniably her responsibility, but I would encourage her to rehome her grandmother's dog since it seems to be too much for her.", "NTA...you were perfectly clear about your feelings on dogs. She accepted that, but is now trying to push the responsibility onto you. She either accepts that or you go back to living separately.", "Absolutely NTA and yes, ADHD is relevant here. With your ADHD brain, walking her dogs is not \"on your radar\", except when it is. It's not a moral failing, like you \"don't care enough to think about it\", or that you should \"just try harder\". That's NOT how an ADHD brain works. People  constantly criticizing you (about all sorts of things) is why anxiety is one of the most common comorbid conditions. You've got a long journey ahead understanding the ins and outs of your ADHD. If you're going to be happy in it, you need a partner willing to journey with you, not criticize every turn. Maybe that will be your current GF, maybe not. Either way, it's going to require LOTS of communication about what it's like in your head.", "NTA but this would be my take: both of you take the dogs for a walk at the same time. Four dogs is a lot for one person to manage anyway, and you can use that time to understand the issues with the two dogs, whatever they are, and how she prefers to deal with them.\n\nAfter you've both walked the dogs a few times, and she's relatively comfortable with you being able to handle the two problematic ones, you can just walk them by yourself without asking. Sometimes people interpret offers of help incorrectly, they think it's a token effort or that the offer is commensurate to actually helping. There's memes about men coming into the kitchen to ask if they can help when 90% of the meal is already done, etc.\n\nSo first I'd say tackle the problem together, and secondly take some initiative and just walk them. Maybe get permission first, ask if it would be ok if you just took them sometimes, but pick your moment.", "This seems like a roundabout and wrong way for her to get whatever she is after. Complaining about something *she* doesn't let you do; even when you offer. So stop offering. Next time she brings it up mention how she always shot you down and then still complained.\n\nMy suggestion, start accompanying her on a walk now and again. Don't offer to walk the dogs, just ask to walk with her.\n\nI don't understand what she's going for unless she's trying to get you to walk the dogs on your own without asking. But it's a strange way to go about it; trying to get you to read her mind or something.\n\nNTA", "Nta. I'm on the fence about whether she's an asshole. Provisionally yes, but you both sound very young. She may not have learned some critical relationship skills and you may not know how to ask what's wrong. So, here are some thoughts from a long time person married to someone with ADHD. 1. She seems insecure, since she's leaning so hard on the dog thing being a sign you don't love her. That could be for any number of reasons that require the help of a therapist, but it could also be that she doesn't realize and appreciate how you express love. She may think love is demonstrated in a particular way (dog walking?) but you express love in another way (idk what that way is). This isn't a character flaw. It's something most folks have to learn. So, in a calm moment talk to her about feeling unloved and tell her that not taking responsibility for the dogs doesn't mean what she thinks it does and lovingly and openingly tell her why you do whatever it is you do to express your love for her. Second, my husband experiences tremendous guilt and stress around his brain working differently than mine. In my view, that shit stops at door of our relationship. No guilt or stress about him remembering stuff comes from me. Your gf using guilt is generally not good relationship hygiene for anyone, but in this context it's particularly shitty. I think the 2 of you should talk about some boundaries in that regard. Specifically, if she needs something (including taking responsibility for something), she needs to ask clearly and without guilt tripping you.", "NTA\n\n> I wouldn't be \"allowed\" to walk them anyways because of some behaviour difficulties with two of the dogs.\n\n>Now that we have moved in together, it's one of the things she constantly nags me about.

You offer and she refuses, but wants you to take the dogs out without asking. It could be your gf feels bad about asking you to help even though she wants it and in her mind you helping out without asking means you are considering her feelings, which is a huge thing to her, probably more than the actual help with the dogs. This may go beyond walking the dogs but could apply to anything that she wants help with but feels bad asking. \n\nThe main reason I have this insight is my wife and I are this way and it took us a few years to unpack this and know each other well enough for her to ask me directly if she wants help with something and me picking up on cues to help her before she asks.", "NTA.\n\n\nYou did the right thing by communicating ahead of time that you cannot take on the daily responsibilities of caring for multiple dogs.

You're even going beyond what you originally agreed to by being willing to walk the dogs if she asks you to.\n\nShe needs to adjust her behavior to match agreed-upon expectations.

The behaviour issues is mostly between the largest dog and the chihuahua. But is usually not a problem outside. However if I walk them I usually take the 3 smaller dogs in one go, then the large dog alone. This obviously takes a lot of time. Which I usually don't have time for in the mornings. But if she wanted me to do that I would plan ahead and get up earlier to do so. The other issue here is that I get up before she does, because I have about an hour+ drive to work, and that wakes up the dogs, so she needs to get up to feed and walk them. So if I need to walk the dogs in the morning, I would probably have to wake up around 4:30 and thats why I would like to either get a heads up or not have to do it at all.", "I have asked, and she then goes on a rant about how she shouldn't have to tell me to do things, I should just do them.
