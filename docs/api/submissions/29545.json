He came home from work today and said his mouth was salivating more than normal and informed me that\u2019s a symptom of ALS. \n\nWhen he first told me he was concerned, my immediate reaction was, obviously, fear and concern so I asked him if he would please call a doctor the next day. He jumped down my throat for not having any sympathy so I shut up and walked away. \n\nHe has a history of complaining about his health and not doing anything about it. He complained about groin pain for the first ten years of our relationship and I got sick of hearing about it so every time he complained I would ask if he had called a doctor yet. The answer was always no. We were on a hiking trip three years ago and when we got back to the cabin he was laying on the sofa and said he felt a bulge in his groin. I immediately knew it was a hernia and told him to make an appointment ASAP. It took withholding sex before he would finally go to a doctor where he was diagnosed with \u201cmassive\u201d bi-lateral hernias. \n\nSo yeah, my sympathy for his health complaints is gone. I feel like he should seek the advice and guidance of a professional if he thinks something is very wrong because I\u2019m as far from being in the medical field as one can get.  I\u2019ve tried making his appointments for him in the past but he either just wouldn\u2019t go or would cancel them. \n\nBack to the ALS concern: Tonight when he got home and informed me about his watery mouth, I asked him if he had called our healthcare provider today. He said no. \n\nI calmly asked him why not and then said I was concerned that he thought he had a serious degenerative disease but wouldn\u2019t do anything about it. An argument ensued and he called me a see you next Tuesday for not having any sympathy for his ailments. I told him I really didn\u2019t care if he THOUGHT he had a serious disease, what I do care about is IF he has a serious disease, knowing that we will tackle it once there\u2019s a diagnosis. I\u2019m not remotely interested in coddling his hypochondria. \n\nSo\u2026 am I the asshole for telling my husband I don\u2019t care he might have a degenerative disease because he won\u2019t seek medical help?\n\nUPDATE: he just called to tell me he was leaving the doctors office. He called this morning and they (SURPRISE) had an appointment. Doc thinks it\u2019s post-covid symptoms but is running a complete blood panel just in case. He\u2019s getting blood drawn tomorrow! \n\nI do think he needs to seek therapy for medical (and maybe generalized) anxiety because this is such a pattern and it shouldn\u2019t get to this point before he\u2019s willing to seek help.

You can't force him to stay alive for your family. You've made doctor's appointments and begged only to be called names.

Just say, \"okay,\" when he complains about his health, change the subject or excuse yourself from the room. But make sure the insurance premiums are paid up and that there is life insurance.

Asking him if he has talked to his doctor yet is showing concern and shows you care about him. What in his mind is the \"sympathy\" you aren't showing?

Oh, hell no.", "NTA. If he doesn't want to do anything about it, then yeah at this point you are NTA. You can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped. I'm disabled. You have to ask for help.

My step dad has been complaining about his back for the longest time but won\u2019t go to the doctor. He knows what the problem is just \u201cnever has the time\u201d to get it treated. After they went on a day shopping trip together and he could barely walk from the car to the doors she had enough. She told him something like \u201cI am no longer going to try to convince you to do what you need to do so you wont leave me a widow. I keep telling you to go to the doctor, you won\u2019t and say you\u2019re ok, and you are doing worse than me\u201d\n\nFor some context my mother nearly died two years ago and had to undergo two major invasive surgeries to save her life.

I had a very severe case and was bleeing internally. whether he is embarresed, scared to be told he does in fact have ALS, or being a hypochondriac he has to seek medical attention.

If it's not serious enough for him to even *call* a doctor, much less go in for an exam, then it's not serious enough to warrant your sympathy and concern.\n\nAs someone who has a degenerative disease, your husband needs to get a grip. Playing the \"what if it's this?\" only gets you so far if you're not willing to even *try* to get an exam or diagnosis.", "Damn! I have a husband that runs to the doctor for everything. Maybe it\u2019s due to his chronic kidney disease. I\u2019m the one that drags my foot a bit. He\u2019s always on me to be on top of preventive care. Oct comes by, he\u2019s like did you get a mammogram yet.", "NTA \n\nWaiting to get things checked usually leads to the issue being worse and more complex, needing more aggressive and invasive treatments, or the loss of slowing down a disease in time.  It\u2019s effing stupid is what it is. I\u2019ve seen it in real life, working in healthcare.  Putting something off if you are afraid of what the Dr might say, doesn\u2019t make it better, or make it go away, it makes it more likely you might die from it ( you know that thing you were first afraid of the Dr saying to begin with), and certainly leads to worse outcomes.   \n\nI wouldn\u2019t care if he thought he had ALS, bc until he sees a Dr, he doesn\u2019t truly know what is going on. It could be anxiety for all he knows.  \n\nNow, let\u2019s address the name calling. What the f*ck. That is not ok. Calling you a c*nt for not having sympathy, for what? Some random ailments that could be anything and that he won\u2019t go see a Dr for? \nAnyone who calls their partner names maliciously, doesn\u2019t deserve said partner, certainly isn\u2019t acting like a mature adult, and definitely has no respect for their partner.\n\nWhy are you married to this whiny, afraid to see the doctor, immature, verbally abusive person?", "I'm pretty sure I'm dying every time I make the mistake of hitting google over a weird physical symptom. which is why I'm voting NTA, because your husband sounds like he's got a whole lot of Dr. Google going on, and that's just exhausting.", "NTA, he\u2019s behaving badly towards you.  Just a suggestion: next time he whines hand him the phone and tell him that he needs to present you a doctor\u2019s note in order to qualify for extra care and babying.  If he starts whining about that just tell him that he\u2019s being stupid for expecting you to be qualified to diagnose and treat a condition that takes a doctor multiple years of training to accurately diagnose and treat.", "NTA. At all.", "NTA I think he is scared to find out if its true and he wnats you to handhold him.", "Meh, NTA and although I think you could probably have handled it with more patience, saying that feels a bit like victim blaming since it sounds like he is quite difficult and antagonistic and unreasonable about getting medical care. It sounds like you would need the patience of a saint. I hope you are able to be more gentle with each other going forward.", "I'm intensely curious here. \n\nDoes he want you to act like he *does* have ALS? \nDoes he know twitching muscles could be a whole range of things? If you told him that, would he expect you to act like he has all of them?", "NTA. He wants sympathy from you, not solutions. Or he\u2019s scared it might be true. They can test now for a lot of degenerative diseases.

Which is an immediate no. It\u2019s a fun cycle.\n\nBut you know what I haven\u2019t done? Called them awful names.

You say he has hypochondria but from your description his problem is not hypochondria but instead refusal to seek care for legit medical issues. Is he afraid of doctors? Has he had bad experiences in the past? When he\u2019s sick or injured does he maybe not want to get better? I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on, and I guess it\u2019s his call whether he sees a doctor. But if he chooses not to, he probably shouldn\u2019t be whining about it. Certainly he shouldn\u2019t call you names like that. The symptoms sound consistent with ALS but my understanding is ALS is incurable so I don\u2019t know if there is any rush to see a doctor. And I think it does come across as unsympathetic when you say you don\u2019t care \u2014 that\u2019s pretty much saying you don\u2019t care if he dies, which is a harsh thing to say even if you are tired of his whining. OTOH I\u2019m not a doctor, I have no idea, it could be anything. Maybe he wants to see if it gets better on its own first. I don\u2019t know. If you and he had more open non-accusatory communication it might be more clear what\u2019s going on with him and how to approach it.

This is very good.", "There was a Scrubs episode about that. Hypochondriac patient takes a scary test as a way for the Dr. to shut him up, only to result in patient actually being sick with scary illness.", "There is no evidence of hypochondria. He had legit medical issues\u2026.he just avoided a doctor.", "I\u2019d argue a hypochondriac is also much more likely to be diagnosed with rare illnesses they do have because they\u2019re so vehement about them if they\u2019re also pursuing treatment. \n\nPeople who are the opposite are more likely to struggle with the symptoms for years or decades or forever depending on the severity of said symptoms.\n\nFlip side being they\u2019re also way more likely to be diagnosed with things they don\u2019t have.\n\nBecause doctors aren\u2019t magical wizards with the ability to stare into your body and objectively measure everything like some sort of healthcare centric Superman. \n\nIf someone insists they have certain symptoms and weird pains for years and years, doctors are likely to just make the best assumption. Which sometimes are incredibly hard to assess chronic illnesses like fibromyalgia for example.\n\nThere are plenty of things on the medical world we can\u2019t test for, can\u2019t fully objectively recognize, but are very very real.", "I think that the fact he absolutely refuses to go to a doctor even after years of complaining about a symptom, suggests to me that he himself does not believe his own complaints are as real or severe as he wants op to believe they are.", "I'm not doubting this is what happens for you, but I'm not sure how typical this is. My wife and I still take care of our responsibilities when capable. When she is sick and I am not, I will take care if her and her responsibilities and vice-versa. There are however situations where we will both get sick with the same things and mine will end up much worse. An example of this was a nasty case of strep throat where I ended up developing an abcess that almost caused my throat to swell shut while she was able to get by without having to go to the ER.\n\nI think there is a middle ground where acknowledging that man-cold is a real thing, but many men take advantage of this and exaggerate in order to avoid responsibilities.\n\nI would refer to these men as \"shitty\"", "It was actually my doctor\u2019s advice when I was little. He was an incredible doctor who would prescribe things outside of your typical meds to help. He and his wife also made the best overnight apple, French toast bake.", "I've gotten better about it over the last five years but I also assumed that nothing was really wrong with me because my parents and my pediatrician always assured me that I was just overdramatic and had a low pain tolerance. Or additionally in my dad's case, that I wanted attention. Sometimes it's optimism and sometimes people have just been taught not to trust themselves.", "I'm like your friend.  I'm so used to being gaslighted by my parents and the medical industry that I've begun doing it to myself.  Decades of being told \"you're just being dramatic\" or \"it's just anxiety,\" and you stop going in just to be chastised.  I had \\*covid\\* a year ago and, until I literally collapsed from fever and exhaustion, convinced myself I was making \"something out of nothing.\"  It isn't that I am avoiding medical care on purpose.  It's that I don't even realize I need it, because I've been thoroughly taught almost nothing should require it.  I even KNOW this is wrong rationally, but I still trick myself.  I tell myself \"the next time you're sick just go in, what could it hurt?\"  But you can't just undo all that programming.", "Yes there is. Based on minor symptoms that could mean anything or nothing he thinks he has ALS. That's hypochondria.", "I'm actually going through this right now. Out of the blue about 4 years ago I started having these shooting pains that originate in my foot and rocket up my legs into my stomach. The opposite of sciatica. I did all the big tests for MS and had a clear bill of health on the MRI. The shooting pains are debilitating and otherwise I get symptoms that align with an atypical presentation of Small Fiber Neuropathy. So that's what they went with for diagnosis. \n\nIts weird though, a *ton* of my other health conditions that were easier to diagnose all tend to be comorbid with diabetes and I'm not even pre-diabetic nor have I ever been.", "Or he has massive anxiety about going to the doctor and having his fears confirmed.", ">I think there is a middle ground where acknowledging that man-cold is a real thing, but many men take advantage of this and exaggerate in order to avoid responsibilities.\n\nAnd that is what i did when i explained why men are sometimes less strong against infections. It doesnot excuse the behavior of many many men when they are ill. Or when their spouses are ill. \n\nYou know that women are way more likely to be abandoned by their spouse if she becomes chronically or terminally ill? \n\nFor example \"a woman is six times more likely to be divorced soon after a cancer diagnosis than if a man in the relationship is the patient\u00a0(20.8% vs. 2.9%) (Glantz et al.\"\n\nWhy? Because men as a collective (not every individual) are not raised to care for others, they are raised to let women care for them. Once the woman is ill many of them bolt."]}
