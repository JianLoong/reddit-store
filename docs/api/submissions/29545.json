He came home from work today and said his mouth was salivating more than normal and informed me that\u2019s a symptom of ALS. \n\nWhen he first told me he was concerned, my immediate reaction was, obviously, fear and concern so I asked him if he would please call a doctor the next day. He jumped down my throat for not having any sympathy so I shut up and walked away. \n\nHe has a history of complaining about his health and not doing anything about it. He complained about groin pain for the first ten years of our relationship and I got sick of hearing about it so every time he complained I would ask if he had called a doctor yet. The answer was always no. We were on a hiking trip three years ago and when we got back to the cabin he was laying on the sofa and said he felt a bulge in his groin. I immediately knew it was a hernia and told him to make an appointment ASAP. It took withholding sex before he would finally go to a doctor where he was diagnosed with \u201cmassive\u201d bi-lateral hernias. \n\nSo yeah, my sympathy for his health complaints is gone. I feel like he should seek the advice and guidance of a professional if he thinks something is very wrong because I\u2019m as far from being in the medical field as one can get.  I\u2019ve tried making his appointments for him in the past but he either just wouldn\u2019t go or would cancel them. \n\nBack to the ALS concern: Tonight when he got home and informed me about his watery mouth, I asked him if he had called our healthcare provider today. He said no. \n\nI calmly asked him why not and then said I was concerned that he thought he had a serious degenerative disease but wouldn\u2019t do anything about it. An argument ensued and he called me a see you next Tuesday for not having any sympathy for his ailments. I told him I really didn\u2019t care if he THOUGHT he had a serious disease, what I do care about is IF he has a serious disease, knowing that we will tackle it once there\u2019s a diagnosis. I\u2019m not remotely interested in coddling his hypochondria. \n\nSo\u2026 am I the asshole for telling my husband I don\u2019t care he might have a degenerative disease because he won\u2019t seek medical help?", "created_utc": 1698114093, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17f21nm/aita_for_telling_my_husband_i_dont_care_that_he/", "score": 435, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Show him how ridiculous he is being by being just as ridiculous?", "Nta. He sounds exhausting.", "NTA. If he's a hypochondriac it's annoying, of he had serious issues and refuses to seek medical attention that's irresponsible and he's using you for emotional support preemptively when he needs to seek medical intervention rather than speculate wildly.", "NTA He wants to complain and not do anything about it, you didn't say you didn't care, and game over when he called you that word", "NTA.

I had a very severe case and was bleeing internally. whether he is embarresed, scared to be told he does in fact have ALS, or being a hypochondriac he has to seek medical attention.

It\u2019s effing stupid is what it is. I\u2019ve seen it in real life, working in healthcare.  Putting something off if you are afraid of what the Dr might say, doesn\u2019t make it better, or make it go away, it makes it more likely you might die from it ( you know that thing you were first afraid of the Dr saying to begin with), and certainly leads to worse outcomes.   \n\nI wouldn\u2019t care if he thought he had ALS, bc until he sees a Dr, he doesn\u2019t truly know what is going on. It could be anxiety for all he knows.  \n\nNow, let\u2019s address the name calling. What the f*ck. That is not ok. Calling you a c*nt for not having sympathy, for what?

Just a suggestion: next time he whines hand him the phone and tell him that he needs to present you a doctor\u2019s note in order to qualify for extra care and babying.

At all.", "NTA I think he is scared to find out if its true and he wnats you to handhold him.", "Meh, NTA and although I think you could probably have handled it with more patience, saying that feels a bit like victim blaming since it sounds like he is quite difficult and antagonistic and unreasonable about getting medical care.

If you told him that, would he expect you to act like he has all of them?", "NTA. He wants sympathy from you, not solutions. Or he\u2019s scared it might be true.

You say he has hypochondria but from your description his problem is not hypochondria but instead refusal to seek care for legit medical issues. Is he afraid of doctors? Has he had bad experiences in the past? When he\u2019s sick or injured does he maybe not want to get better? I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s going on, and I guess it\u2019s his call whether he sees a doctor. But if he chooses not to, he probably shouldn\u2019t be whining about it. Certainly he shouldn\u2019t call you names like that. The symptoms sound consistent with ALS but my understanding is ALS is incurable so I don\u2019t know if there is any rush to see a doctor. And I think it does come across as unsympathetic when you say you don\u2019t care \u2014 that\u2019s pretty much saying you don\u2019t care if he dies, which is a harsh thing to say even if you are tired of his whining. OTOH I\u2019m not a doctor, I have no idea, it could be anything. Maybe he wants to see if it gets better on its own first. I don\u2019t know.
