Before this happened, Madi\u2019s elective course was being an office aid. Her job was just to make sure that students entering the office added their name and which staff member they were seeing on the office sign-in sheet.\n\nMadi usually uses the main computer in our living room, since the one she borrows from school blocks most sites. I went to the computer to print something and saw that Madi was on Snapchat and saying mean things about another girl named Erin.\n\nMadi was telling the other people in the group chat that Erin sees the school therapist every day. Along with revealing that private information, she was saying cruel things such as \u201cI bet she\u2019s a skitzo\u201d and that Erin had no friends.\n\nI confronted Madi about it when she came back from the bathroom. Madi made an excuse that it wasn\u2019t bullying because \u201cI\u2019d never say it to her face,\u201d claimed that she wasn\u2019t telling anyone outside of her group chat, and begged me not to tell our parents.\n\nI made a deal with Madi that I would not tell our parents but that she is not allowed to bully Erin (or anyone else) or share any more of her private information. But less than a week later, I caught her again saying cruel things about Erin and a different kid through Snapchat.\n\nWhen Madi left the computer unattended, I took screenshots. I emailed them to her school, explained the situation, and asked to be kept anonymous. Madi got in trouble, was removed as an office aid, and placed in ceramics because it was the only available elective class.\n\nI know from friends who have taken ceramics that the teacher and his class are **hard**. He runs it like an AP and counselors will warn students not to sign up for the class unless they\u2019re serious about ceramics. Madi is not good at art and she\u2019s afraid she won\u2019t pass.\n\nThe stress is clearly affecting Madi\u2019s grades in her other classes. It\u2019s not to the point that her ability to graduate will be impacted, but Madi\u2019s still slipping below the grade standards of her choice colleges. Madi has not told our parents (I am not sure why they were not informed of Madi\u2019s removal as an office aid, or if Madi hid it from them somehow.)\n\nI have explained what happened to several outsiders, and they are split between saying I was justified and calling me the asshole. The ones calling me an asshole are saying that I was upset about my own experiences of being bullied and didn\u2019t handle the situation objectively. And that my parents probably wouldn\u2019t have done much but I still could have tried to tell them.\n\nOthers said that a lot of teenagers act the way Madi did out of immaturity/ignorance but she doesn\u2019t deserve the intense stress she\u2019s facing now. And that I could have shown her videos or articles about teens with bad home lives/mental health and tried to educate her in a way that wouldn\u2019t impact her academics.

It\u2019s not great, but it happens.\n\nHowever, your sister crossed a series line revealing privileged information about a student, a minor even. This is close to felony level issues.\n\nDue to that alone, NTA. The ramifications on this could also be felt by the therapist as well depending upon what was done by the school.", "NTA\n\nNever enable bullying, your sister is a major AH and even broke a few laws i believe.\n\nHowever with that said, you should have told your parents and let them deal with it. And threaten if she continued to bully you\u2019d tell the school.\nThat was also your \u201cdeal\u201d.", "NTA your sister was abusing her position of power. Its not your place to educate your sister on how to be a decent human being but it *is* your place to protect the people she's hurting. Well done for standing up for someone who needed it.", "NTA - it\u2019s the bullying aspect, but it\u2019s also her divulging private information about another student. She violated that confidentiality. You brought it to the attention of the appropriate people and they took care of it as per their rules and procedures.", "NTA\n\nGood for you not tolerating Madi's horrible behavior. As a HS junior, she's old enough to know better than to bully. You warned her and she didn't stop. And if the fallout from this is impacting her grades (oh the horror of having to take ceramics!!) then that's her own fault.", "NTA. \n\nWhat she did was incredibly serious. Revealing private medical information isn't some small thing. It's really not something the school should have allowed her to know about in the first place. It opens them up to serious liability. If she were actually employed in healthcare, rather than this just being a school thing, it would have serious, potentially career-ending, implications.\n\nI wouldn't think about it primarily in terms of consequences for her behaviour, or as a way to change her behaviour in future. This is about preventing further harm. She needed to be removed from her position immediately, and telling the school was the best way to make this happen. You really should have told them straight away, rather than giving a warning, but I think most people in your situation would have probably warned her too.\n\nLeaking healthcare information is the type of thing that can permanently undermine trust and lead to people not seeking care, potentially with deadly consequences. She was dangerous and needed to be stopped immediately before she hurt more people.", "I don't agree with the Y T As you're NTA.\n\nThis isn't just talking behind someone's back and making fun of them - your sister works with sensitive information (f.e. seeing the school therapist) about other people and she is sharing this. This is an absolute no go and this is why she lost the the ability to work there.\n\nShe has no place in a job like this if she can't keep her mouth shut, sorry but this is not okay. \n\nYou even gave her a chance to stop it and did it again anyway.", "NTA.  You stuck up for bullied kids, that's commendable.  Also, she was majorly violating HIPAA (The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) if you're in the United States.  A high school junior is either 16 or 17 in 99% of cases and should be mature enough to behave better.  You even gave her a chance to reform, and she did not.

They aren't ignorant to anything that is happening. A lot of them (not all) just don't respond because it isn't affecting them. Watching the videos and reading the articles would likely do nothing but piss her off. \n\nMost schools have a zero tolerance policy for bullying--but they can only do something if they know about it. What Madi did by abusing her position as an office aid brought her own consequences. NTA.", "Nta, maybe she learned her lesson to not bully others and share private information.", "Your sister seems like the type who would cheat on her bf constantly and say 'its not cheating if he doesnt know about it'.", "NTA, your sister had access to private information and decided to share them with friends to humiliate others. That's wrong. I hope her college choice won't be affected but I think you did the right thing exposing her. \nMaybe telling your parents would be the better choice, I don't know. But I absolutely think that something should be done in a case like this. And clearly talking to her didn't to the trick", "NTA. This doesn't seem like such an awful consequence for Madi to face. I'm sure it's stressful but she brought the problem on herself. It is indeed a severe infraction to disclose such private information about another student (though I wonder what the school was doing with the office aids program to ensure such breaches wouldn't occur...). You gave her a warning, she opted to ignore it. She can have a bad grade in an elective, or can put the work in to get a decent grade. I would be surprised if this greatly impacts her college outlook - lots of students end up with a bad grade over the course of their HS curriculum and still get into good colleges. Seems like a good learning experience to be honest.", "NTA. Your sister played the bully card and lost. Did she learn anything? Only time will tell. As to the future she'll need to work a little harder.", "NTA. Actions have consequences. Harsh lesson but Madi is not a little kid.", "You probably could have given your sister a warning, going to your parents first and to the school as a last resort, but... honestly? NTA. You taught her actions have consequences.", "NTA\n\nBullying is awful and can cause longterm trauma. Releasing confidential information maliciously is awful as well, and could give rise to individual and school liability for harmful consequences.\n\nYou warned her. She persisted. She deserves the stress and consequences. Although your situation less traumatic than rape, I've heard these \"she doesn't deserve these severe of consequences\" before, in defense of people like Brock Turner. No offense, but fuck your sister's stress and her possible loss of the opportunity to attend an \"elite' college. She certainly doesn't have elite morals.\n\nMaybe you ought to leak the info to your parents as well. She needs some parental guidance still in working on her ethics and her understanding of consequences.", "Question: Why are you so involved in your sisters life when you are in college?", "NTA- She f\u2019d around and found out what happens. This may be a little set back now, but it is lesson that lasts a lifetime.", "... I feel like you are completly overly fixated on your sister\n\n\n\n- \"I wen to the computer to print something\" and than decided to snoop through your sisters privat chats. This seems to be some kind of hobby because \"less than a week later\" you did that again. \n\n\nI wonder when you read her messages actually the first time, how often you read them and how often you use them against her\n\n\n\n- talking trash behind someone back is bitching and not bullying. Did your sister actually bully erin or was she just bitching? And yes- there is a BIG difference.\n\n\n\n- You didn't talk to your parents. You felt like the auhtority- wrong!\n\n\n\n- you go around town and tell how horrible your sister is serval outsiders. That is somehow fine. Bitching about erin = bullying. Bitching about maddie = great siblkng behaviour \n\n\nAll in all I wonder if maddie juges other people this harshly because of your behaviour towards her. You cross serious boundries like they are nothing. Judge your sister like you are an actual judge. \n\n\n\nMaddie is in the wrong here too. But why the fuck does the school give other students a task like that? Saving ok actual emplpyees? \n\n\nESH", "NTA.\nShe\u2018s old enough to know this is not okay and you even gave her a warning. Great that you put an end to this behaviour. It\u2018s good she got removed from her position because sharing sensitive personal info about others is not cool and who knows what this could do to that poor girl\u2018s mental health. Someone who is in the need of weekly therapy sessions really doesn\u2018t need that added to their situation, that\u2018s incredibly cruel.", "YTA. You're taking the self-righteous act a bit far. None of that was any if your business. Your sister, like every other human on earth, is allowed to vent privately. She should go NC with your toxic ass.", "YTA. This is something that your parents should've handled, not you. Because guess what? You're a sibling, not a parent. So yeah, you overstepped and need to know when to keep your nose out of things.", "YTA\n\nI think you're a good person for wanting to stop bullying but you're not her parent, I think you should have told your parents instead of contacting the school without their input. This could have been an issue solved with discipline and restrictions at home instead of interfering with her academics.\n\nAlso I've been a teenage girl and while she is being a bitch to Erin in my experience its often a lot more complicated with teenage girls than a simple bully and victim dynamic. Erin could be a class A bitch too and while your sister is wrong for spreading rumors and making fun of mental health teenage girls are awful and take low blows. From the information I have I don't think your sister should have to carry this for the rest of her life, sometimes being a young stupid teenager isn't an excuse and certain actions should fuck up your life but your sister was just being a bitch with her friends in a group chat not tormenting a girl in person or online. If it was a bigger problem and intense bullying was occurring these consequences seem appropriate though but it still shouldn't have been up to you.\n\nAgain, I think it was a massive overstep to fuck with her academic life. You're not her parent. You're probably a much kinder person than your sister is right now and you had good intentions but this just wasn't your call to make, you can help your sister just by being a good example for her to follow.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is what they did do. Any consequences are of her own actions. You might have saved Erin's life.", "Madi is the AH.", "Nta shit talking, while not nice is part of high school.  Where she crossed the line was using private info to do said shit talking.  She proved she can't be trusted to keep her mouth shut, so she doesn't get the easy credit.", "NTA Now Madi knows what having problems in HS is like. Too bad she couldn't have empathy rather than justice, but there it is.", "NTA. It was absolutely necessary that she be removed from her role as office aid. What she was doing was nasty and also incredibly unethical. Honestly, the consequences she's faced aren't really enough but fingers crossed she learns from the experience and stops being a horrible, ignorant, ablesist asshole.", "NTA\nShe could easily have been prosecuted for revealing that information in several jurisdictions.", "NTA play stupid games win stupid prizes. HIPAA privacy act in the states comes to mind. I hope your sister doesn\u2019t plan on going into the medical field. Too many medical student go for the money and not because they actually like helping people.", "NTA. \"Teens are shitty\" is not a valid excuse for anything. Another thing about being a teen is learning that actions have consequences. Considering the way she violated this girl's medical privacy, she's getting off light.", "NTA, what your sister did was a major violation of a person's privacy, and, at least in America (not sure if you're in the US), that can have some serious legal repercussions.

NTA", "I normally don't comment once a post has this many comments but I feel a show of support is necessary here. \n\nYou are not the ATA and what you did was the right thing, even if it causes problems for your sister. Saying mean things about other kids is uncool but relatively normal. What your sister did is way beyond this. It is absolutely unacceptable for her to spread information gained from her position. You gave her a warning which is more than I would have done, she chose to ignore it so the consequences are all on her.", "NTA for sharing a story with a happy ending. I hope Madi doesn't get into her choice college, and I hope she never achieves any position of authority or trust before she figures her stuff out.\n\nBtw anti-bullying policies at schools usually require notification of parents, so chances are your parents know. Make of that what you will.", "NTA - your sister took private and confidential notes from therapy sessions and shared them without any permission. If a therapist did that then they would get fired. Your sister needs to understand the repercussions of her actions and come to terms with it. If you want to be an awesome sister (even more awesome that you already are) then I would find ways to help and encourage her, and be a cheer leader. What she did was terrible, but now this is a new beast she is dealing with and if you are able and willing to help, go for it :-)\n\nSecond... why the hell does her school have it set up so that she can see those notes? That is insane from an educational and administrative standpoint.", "NTA. Using confidential information for personal reasons is never OK, ESPECIALLY if it's used to bully someone. That's the kind of thing that on a professional level costs people jobs, licenses and certifications, and possibly jail time depending on the job and information shared. Actions have consequences, and it's better for her to learn that now.", "NTA. she is learning actions have consequences.", "Idk chief was kinda thinking yta but exposing private medical info is a big nono", "NTA\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t be in a position to have that information if she\u2019s going to use it like that. Being a bully should have consequences", "NTA. So she isn\u2019t saying it to Erin\u2019s face. Big whoop.

Visiting a school counselor is not subject to HIPAA", "Given that OP says it was the main computer in the living room, it sounds like this is some family computer they all have access to. The only questionable thing is if OP deliberately opened their sister's Snapchat account to snoop, but it's also possible either the app was already open when OP used it after their sister or a notification about what sister was saying popped up. \n\nLike, I get that by saying the sister should report OP and her them expelled, you're most likely being facetious, but unless Madi could prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that OP violated her privacy (which would be hard to do on a family computer), there is little to no chance OP's going to face repurcussions.", "She should be dancing out of joy that her punishment is so non-existent. She just need to work hard, boohoo. To think that she is old enough to go soon to college and live her own life but doesn't see that this is the result of her own action. Sis gave her a chance, which was more than most people would have done, but she didn't stop the shit.", "Right? She should be grateful they're covering it up like they are. If it had gotten out she'd be persona non grata at many colleges, because they don't want to be associated with that type of person. They probably don't even have the real reason on her record or at least not in detail. I hope that the sis doesn't do anything stupid in an attempt to get \"revenge\" or encourage her friends, as this could lead to expulsion. \n\nWhat she's experiencing is far far lighter than the bullying the other girl is getting.", "That's assuming they documented it in that much detail. I can see them leaving it open ended, particularly as her getting her hands on the info could leave them in some legal hot water as well. I can see people asking why a student would be privy or have access to such personal information. It leaves them liable.", "The same like everybody else. Why don't you actually read relevant the laws instead of spouting unqualified bs?", "The school is probably being so lenient about it because her actions beg the question, \u201chow did a student get access to private information about their peers?\u201d.
