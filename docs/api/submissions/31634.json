My coworkers know about some difficulties I face when trying new dishes is about textures.\n\nSo, there's this guy (mid to late 30's i think, M) -- let's call him Jim -- that is very loud and opinionated on some things, and one of them is that he thinks disorders and mental health issues aren't real. Lately he's been trying to pick on me about my autism but I'm not very reactive to it.\n\nThis week, at lunchtime, I was eating leftovers of a pizza I had over the weekend and talking with my friends and he was at the table too. He had a packed lunch that had olives, a food I might have stated my dislike for at some point.\n\nJim looked at my pizza (it was shrimp pizza, don't judge!) and said something along the lines of \"for someone that hates olives like a kid, you eat pretty gross shit too\" and I replied with a shrug and moved on with my talk. He then interrupted our conversation saying \"I just think if you were really 'autistic' you wouldn't even eat shrimps\" and did air quotes to the \"autistic\".\n\nI looked at him with a polite fake smile to see if he was just trying to do one more of his unfunny jokes but he looked pretty serious. I bluntly said \"your opinion won't make me stop eating shrimp nor start eating olives\". He loudly said \"hey\" and started inquiring on why I was \"being an asshole\" and I pointed out that it's disingenuous to make snide remarks on my choice for food and disability and then get mad when I don't really care. I didn't try to look cool or be extra, I was just defending myself.\n\nHe rolled his eyes and walked off, and the other coworker I now find unpleasant (40F) -- let's call her Carly -- told me I should respect his right to an opinion. I said I do.\n\nThis all came over to me as a huge non-issue and a petty one-sided fight over nothing, but today I received an e-mail requesting I go to the office tomorrow first thing in the morning to have a talk with my superiors over an \"incident\" about \"hostility within the workplace\" that someone reported.

Not an expert, but I think you can't request ADA accommodations without an official diagnosis.", "I don't know if you're able to eat all of the toppings, but one of the most popular pizzas in our area is shrimp, onions, sausage and mushrooms. Delicious.", "Oh, I meant they could be better colleagues than you expected (not in a romantic sense). \n\nShrimp and any kind of seafood is good to me!", "Lol I meant Dwight from the Office. Between him being autistic coded and your choice of the name \"Jim\" for the dude messing with him, I thought you were posting a parody post where you're complaining from Dwight's POV, because I'm reality, Jim's kind of a jerk to him with all the pranks.\n\n\nNTA btw, what you said was pretty mild. You didn't even insult him, you literally just stated that him talking wasn't going to change your food preference.....which is a fact. It's not like you slapped the olives out of his hands and shoved your pizza into his mouth. His reaction speaks of someone who has issues with control and self regulating his own feelings. It's genuinely weird he's this upset over something that literally doesn't affect him. \n\n\nAnyone who says different is either looking for a fight, didn't understand what happened and took a side, or lives life bending over backwards to never even passively hurt anyone's feelings. None of those are people whose opinion on this matters.", "I can't even see what was there but for it to be removed it had to be bad.", "Regardless of what they do about it, your experience needs to be documented, because when they eventually look into it they\u2019ll realise they screwed up by not taking action sooner. Also don\u2019t be impolite to anyone, we don\u2019t have to react when people are rude to us.", "It's actually covfefe, not kerffuffle.", "OMG thank you. Lol. It felt off at the time I was writing it, but I was sidetracked by my indignation!", "I'm very big on TV series but I've never watched The Office, I probably should give it a try after my long queue of movies and series currently waiting for me (\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80)\n\nAnyways, thanks for your feedback, I'll atake your theories in consideration", "Not hardly. Lol called Jim and Carly \u201cmean names\u201d  \ud83d\ude0f and that they need to be reported to HR and that you can\u2019t claim the right to share an opinion yet be offended when someone replies back with their own. But hey, whatever lol"]}
