Although there are a few conflicts like in any space, I have friends and it's mostly peaceful in there.\n\nFor context, I got a late diagnosis of autism back in 2019 and I've been finding out it has impacted my social relationships my whole life. My coworkers know about some difficulties I face when trying new dishes is about textures.\n\nSo, there's this guy (mid to late 30's i think, M) -- let's call him Jim -- that is very loud and opinionated on some things, and one of them is that he thinks disorders and mental health issues aren't real. Lately he's been trying to pick on me about my autism but I'm not very reactive to it.\n\nThis week, at lunchtime, I was eating leftovers of a pizza I had over the weekend and talking with my friends and he was at the table too. He had a packed lunch that had olives, a food I might have stated my dislike for at some point.\n\nJim looked at my pizza (it was shrimp pizza, don't judge!) and said something along the lines of \"for someone that hates olives like a kid, you eat pretty gross shit too\" and I replied with a shrug and moved on with my talk. He then interrupted our conversation saying \"I just think if you were really 'autistic' you wouldn't even eat shrimps\" and did air quotes to the \"autistic\".\n\nI looked at him with a polite fake smile to see if he was just trying to do one more of his unfunny jokes but he looked pretty serious. I bluntly said \"your opinion won't make me stop eating shrimp nor start eating olives\". He loudly said \"hey\" and started inquiring on why I was \"being an asshole\" and I pointed out that it's disingenuous to make snide remarks on my choice for food and disability and then get mad when I don't really care. I didn't try to look cool or be extra, I was just defending myself.\n\nHe rolled his eyes and walked off, and the other coworker I now find unpleasant (40F) -- let's call her Carly -- told me I should respect his right to an opinion. I said I do.\n\nThis all came over to me as a huge non-issue and a petty one-sided fight over nothing, but today I received an e-mail requesting I go to the office tomorrow first thing in the morning to have a talk with my superiors over an \"incident\" about \"hostility within the workplace\" that someone reported.

Jim and Carly certainly are, but be prepared for this meeting. If you have any documentation (recordings, messages, etc) of Jim commenting on mental health, bring them as evidence of how he is creating a hostile work environment.", "NTA. Jim was. He was openly rude and disrespectful. You handled it gracefully and professionally imho. I really don\u2019t see why anyone would think YTA and not Jim. You\u2019d think HR would have his ass for harassing someone about their health issues regardless of whether they believe in them or not.

They are creating a hostile work environment for a condition that is covered under ADA (or look for local laws that cover disabilities).  I really didn't want to make it a thing with HR or the labor board but a public apology from Jim and Carly would go a long way to making things go smoothly.  A promise from the two of them that there will be no further incidents will also make me feel better.  Also, special training for the two of them about disabilities and laws regarding disabilities would probably save the company from future lawsuits as well. \n\nThanks you so much for your support.  By the way, who can I thank for supporting both me and the company like this?\"\n\nSmile, sit back and take notes.", "NTA. Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that's very real.

On a surface level of this issue, you were right. His opinion on what is and isn't \"good\" food has nothing to do with you. What you eat can't be dictated by someone else. On a deeper level, and I feel this is more important to note, he is straight up harassing you in your workplace for your autism. That is frowned upon in so many levels, and you shouldn't have to tolerate that. I strongly suggest documenting these occurrences and taking them to HR. No one should have to deal with a hostile work environment.", "NTA. Dude needs to mind his own business.", "No, you're NTA. If the others have the right to their opinions, surely you also have the right to yours, and you didn't start the conversation. Any hostility came from others refusing to drop the subject of food. Which, by the way, is NEVER a polite subject to bring up in public. I used to eat my lunch in my car, to avoid the break room.", "NTA\n\nYes, he has a right to have an opinion. And you have the right to think the opinion is bullshit.", "NTA, and keep some records of the exchange and of your coming exchange with HR.

If he can\u2019t take it, he shouldn\u2019t be dishing it out. We learn this in kindergarten. Jim is the a-hole here.", "NTA. Everyone has their right to their opinion, but there's a difference between having an opinion and blasting your opinion to everyone else. There's a saying: \"Opinions are like assholes - everyone has one, and they all stink.\"  \n\nIn the future, rather than just not caring, I would document instances of Jim making jokes about your autism. If you live in a one-party state, then I would also record the conversations as well. That way, when HR gets involved like this you have proof to defend yourself.", "NTA\n\nBe sure to request HR be in the meeting\n\nI'm sure they will be delighted to hear that your diagnosed and documented disability was the reason Jim initiated the conversation. \n\nBe sure to check with the coworkers who were also present for their recollections of the 'incident' as well. \n\nJim may be hoisted on his own petard.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
