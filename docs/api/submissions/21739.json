Most would realize immediately what happened, some would be clueless.\n\nBut there were usually kids around, or worse, teenage boys. So, I would snatch a towel from the side of the pool and use it like a curtain or just use my body and lifeguard tube, *while not looking at the woman or touching her*, and letting her know what's up.\n\nThe vast majority of ladies would sheepishly thank me or laugh their heads off with their friends. The teenage boys cursed me and called me gay (this was the early 90s).\n\nHowever, one woman tore me a new one for trying to embarrass her and for being a creep, even though she still took advantage of the towel-curtain. I was slack jawed AND a manager was nearby and wrote me up. Wouldn't tell me what I did wrong or what I should do in the future, just wrote me up.\n\nPeople are weird.", "Exactly this.
