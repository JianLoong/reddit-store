Years ago I went to a library and idnt realise the back of my dress was hooked up on the keyring of my backpack. And you could see everything. And a man came up to me when no one else did to tell me.

You were trying to be nice and the friend was being a jerk. You weren't chastising the girl or anything.", "NTA, they are. I\u2019m from the US & if I every have a wardrobe malfunction please tell me. I will thank you and correct it.", "Definitely NTA. Her friend just HAD to say something and that's the best she came up with?

In this case, it turns out that she didn\u2019t care that her top wasn\u2019t covering her nipples, but usually that\u2019s inadvertent and most people would be glad to know. You didn\u2019t make a big huge embarrassing deal about it, just a small gesture and a few words like you would if somebody\u2019s zipper was down. It\u2019s not like you had to be staring inappropriately to have noticed  it.", "To be clear: NTA\n\nI expect however that this was a miscommunication? The friend may have thought you were just commenting in general on her chest/bikini, rather than pointing out a specific issue with it\n\nYou DEFINITELY did the right thing, even if she intentionally had her nipple out, no reasonable person would be offended or have their day ruined by you pointing it out", "Once got the stink eye from a drunk girl at a horse race who came out of the bathroom with both her boobs all the way out of her fancy dress.  I said \u201chey\u201d and just motioned to my chest, and she gave me the stink eye, so I said well if you don\u2019t care than I don\u2019t either.  She had great boobs too.", "NTA. It doesn't sound like you were judgemental. You were just letting someone know their nip was out, in case they didn't know. If she did know, nothing to be embarrassed about, so why would she care? Her friend is clearly very defensive and needs to calm down.", "NTA what's wrong with people.", "NAH - your intentions were noble.   These days people want to do what they want without comment from strangers, so if you said more you'd probably be in for a nasty scene.  So if you don't want a battle, just keep walking.", "NTA. You were discreet and did this exactly the way you\u2019re supposed to go about it when letting someone know they\u2019re having a wardrobe malfunction", "You didn\u2019t touch her, you gestured to your own body to show she was exposed. You did so in a friendly way and helpful way. Anyone in their right mind would be appreciative. NTA", "NTA. If it helps, I once had a guy give me shit after I let him know he was literally on fire. Not sure how it happens but the bottom of his jeans had a big smouldering patch which he hadn't noticed, despite us being inside and there being a lot of smoke.", "NTA.  I\u2019m ever so grateful to the guy who, four years ago, slipped behind me to let me know that my pants were \u201csoiled\u201d.  I\u2019d had a surprise bleed (thanks peri-meno) and would never have known.", "I was in hospital on Thursday with heart problems and also have a messed up shoulder, calcification tendinitis so can't do a bra easily and have resorted to tie top bikinis.   Had to get an IV of beta blocker to slow my heart down and blood tests to check no heart damage.  Removed my bikini top with very thin tshirt for treatment and heart monitor stickers, I'm wandering through hospital with a very thin t shirt.  You do you boo but when nips or minge on display I would like to know.  Asked a nice, kind looking woman in x ray waiting area if she could see my nips as it's chilly in hospital and semi see through top, very kindly she told me I was decent.  If my literal nipple was hanging through a bikin top I'd like to know, in a nice way, no body or tit shaming going on here but if you're into that as like a kink or body showing expect nice people to let you know you're flashing.  You were being nice, I would've appreciated it, there are ways of going about things and yours sounded like you were kindly, friendly and just letting someone know.  We aren't all exhibitionists and accidents happen.", "YTA, just because you feel the need to hide the nip doesn't mean everyone else has to, mind your own business.", "Well the exposure is illegal in most places so nothing wrong with the heads up but leave it there. Some people are just totally unhinged.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA, you were just trying to help.", "Nta her friend is wack. I always feel bad telling men their fly is down but I am sure they appreciate the heads up.", "NTA, but the persons friend is. She can\u2019t be that good of a friend if a literal stranger has to point out a wardrobe malfunction. A good friend would have done that themselves.", "You\u2019re never ta for discreetly pointing out something that can be fixed in 15 seconds. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour comment was just taken the wrong way. You weren't calling it inappropriate or body shaming, you just weren't sure if she was aware and wanted to ensure she wouldn't be embarrassed to look down and notice it had been like that for who knows how long\n\nThe friend was sticking up for her, which is good, things just escalated unnecessarily", "She must have meant to walk around with it half exposed i would assume then and the friend was pissed that you even said anything lol ? Im so confused at why she would call you out for that when your just pointing out something lol, not like you made the situation lol. \n\nNta", "NTA, in my opinion.

That kind of confrontation is not worth it and is becoming more and more common as of late.", "The offense at being told of the \"wardrobe malfunction\", done discretely with good will intent to circumvent embarrassment, tells me that it might have been deliberate exposure. \n\nEither they were looking for a fight about gender equality/inequality, or they get off on the act of exposing, or both.", "Yup. All that needs to be said about it.", "which has actually happened to me, but in their defense i was on full display and had no idea.", "The \"friend\" was likely fully aware of the malfunction and happy about it. Op spoiled his fun. I've had dudes get mad at me for that before.", "who was that guy that said he would die for lucy liu after she tucked in the tag on his shirt and said \u201cthere, now you\u2019re perfect\u201d? i forget. \n\nbut yeah, same, assuming it\u2019s something i can fix in the moment. if someone tells me my pants are too small or something i\u2019ll just feel like shit, but letting me know my top has slipped down is 100% a good deed. as long as you\u2019re not laughing while you do it. which has actually happened to me, but in their defense i was on full display and had no idea.\n\nedit: judgement! nta", "Same.  I once had a lady tell me I had sat in something and it was on my pants.  She offered me a baby wipe to get it off.  I was grateful because we were going somewhere else and I would have walked around with ice cream or something going down the leg of my pants all day.", "Well if they were walking abreast I can see how she wouldn't notice.", "I really hope this was the case, and she feels like an AH for jumping down OP's throat for just trying to help!", "It does depend on the state. In New York, a woman can legally be topless anywhere a man can.", "I\u2019m tired and I misread \u201cin a bar\u201d as \u201con a boar\u201d somehow, and was faintly puzzled but yet not surprised.", "If only one is out it is usually by accident. Apart from that, most women are still uncomfortable with showing nipples. Worst case scenario is that they don\u2019t care. Best you have saved her from further embarrassment that she might feel about it.\nMost women would definitely want to know.", "Bot stealing from u/dryadduinath. Report > Spam", "You were being nice, I would've appreciated it, there are ways of going about things and yours sounded like you were kindly, friendly and just letting someone know.", "You jumped straight to \"they're either sexist or theirs perverts\" and didn't consider that  maybe her friend didn't even realize that the nipple had been out, and just thought OP was criticizing her friend's bikini?", "It might be deliberate. And that doesn't mean they get off on it it might just be their preference.\n\nBut since OP clearly had good intentions and was acting based on the fact most people would not want that the reaction is so over the top dickish. \"thanks but it's fine\" or just ignore her, would have been the appropriate reaction to if the nipple being visible was on purpose", "Where\u2019d you get the friend was a guy?", ">who was that guy that said he would die for lucy liu after she tucked in the tag on his shirt and said \u201cthere, now you\u2019re perfect\u201d?\n\nDouglas Copeland  https://www.ft.com/content/2a7e4c54-dd05-11e6-9d7c-be108f1c1dce", "If it had been me I\u2019d be glad for the assist. This is like holding the door open for people. Some are going to say thank you, some will think it\u2019s weird you stood there for so long to do something for them they could do themselves but won\u2019t say anything, and some people are going to get huffy and tell you they are perfectly capable of holding a door. You were trying to be nice, they didn\u2019t take it that way, but that doesn\u2019t mean you did something wrong or that a large number of people wouldn\u2019t appreciate the gesture.", "So a man presenting a clear wardrobe malfunction gets warned about it (an exhibitionist man would purposefully push out of his down fly, a male with a wardrobe malfunction would have junior hidden but be blissfully ignorant to his fly status)\n\nBut a woman presenting a clear wardrobe malfunction doesn't (if it wasn't a wardrobe malfunction she'd either have no bikini top, or both nipples displayed, not a peek at half of one nipple which is clearly just her tying up at a skewiff angle) \n\nMay I ask why?", "thanks!", "that\u2019s the one! thanks, good sleuthing!"]}
