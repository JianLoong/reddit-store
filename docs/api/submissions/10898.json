So, I have been giving her rides to work in the morning.\n\nShe keeps complaining about my music selection (I listen to a lot of rap and hip-hop) because she says it\u2019s degrading and sexist. However, I just listen to it because I like the musicality, not because I\u2019m endorsing the lyrics. She told me to turn off the radio while she\u2019s in the car, but I refused because it\u2019s a 35 minute drive and I want some entertainment. \n\nYesterday, she started complaining again when this 21 Savage song came on, and I told her to just wear ear plugs or AirPods if it bothers her that much. She called me an inconsiderate asshole. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Here\u2019s an example of the level of music she criticizes me for playing because she finds it misogynistic. I thought this would be important to clarify because some people are suggesting I play violently sexist music in the car, when in reality it\u2019s mainstream hits that have questionable lyrics if you think about it.\n\nFor example, I was playing \u201cI Just Wanna Rock\u201d by Lil Uzi Vert the other day, and then she started lecturing me about objectification because of one line where he says \u201cshawty got that body-ody-ah, hit it once, no ties.\u201d", "created_utc": 1677359795, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11bvzkt/aita_for_playing_sexist_music_in_my_car/", "score": 319, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, I just listen to it because I like the musicality, not because I\u2019m endorsing the lyrics. She told me to turn off the radio while she\u2019s in the car, but I refused because it\u2019s a 35 minute drive and I want some entertainment. \n\nYesterday, she started complaining again when this 21 Savage song came on, and I told her to just wear ear plugs or AirPods if it bothers her that much.

It\u2019s up to OP to find that out.", "I disagree, however I appreciate your rational approach compared to the others who are calling me names and telling me to shut the f up.... on an \"am I the asshole\" post. \n\n\nIf someone says what you are doing is causing them significant emotional distress, and you ignore them and continue to do it after they have conveyed the impact, then I do think there is intent in continuing the behavior.", "So because sexism is so common place and it's socially acceptable we shouldn't try and be better ourselves? \nAlso I can name 100, most being women. Maybe he shouldn't surround himself with men who make music like that.", "[removed]", "It doesn\u2019t go both ways because women are oppressed, men are not.\n\nRegardless, maybe you can compromise and play a few Megan songs during your car rides? It\u2019s the same musicality of rap that you like and she likes it too.", "I don\u2019t have an opinion on who is TA here, but what if you tried artists like Open Mike Eagle, Blackalicious, and Aesop Rock for when she\u2019s in the car? (Or even when she\u2019s not, because their lyrics are extremely well done, imo)", "I literally cannot listen to my husband's music. He listens to heavy metal and the bass hurts my head so bad. So we find harder rock that's not bass heavy and other stuff.\n\nIf she's being bothered by the lyrics, then he should listen. We should listen to him about the songs.\n\nEventually there will be a road trip and you need to compromise or it's a long ride in silence.", "If you really want to listen to rap for the beats, maybe try NF, he doesn\u2019t curse and he never objectifies/degrades women, so I think it would be compromise for you and GF because you would get to listen to your rap and she won\u2019t be uncomfortable, I bet he\u2019s got songs that she would like too.", "Did the lyrics to that bother you? Did you tell her so?", "Seriously? Yes, like, a lot of it. Female rappers exist, you know, and do the exact same shit from the other side.", "there is, think of female rappers like megan thee stallion, nicki minaj, saweetie etc. it\u2019s all the same stuff", "There is a fuck ton.", "Exactly. Theres millions of songs about women that's degrading. There's not one about men cause shocker men aren't oppressed the way women are. He's choosing to hurt her and rub his sexism in her face. She doesn't have to compromise her music taste cause he's the only one in the wrong. Making him the asshole.", "He doesn\u2019t have to listen to rap while she\u2019s in the car. That\u2019s my point.", "I'd dump her. She sounds like a clown. But I'm just here to point out your hypocrisy. Run along.", "Maybe she should respect how he feels and let him listen to his own music while doing her a favour?", "So much red flags.", "100%", "Just sounds like a stubborn/maturity issue. It's only over music, and anyone who cares about the longevity of their relationship would just compromise over something like this, that isn't that deep. I still don't like it being called smth as serious as that, mostly due to both my and friends experiences.\n\nBest bet is he realises it isn't worth the trouble to not budge over this.", "Mightve mixed up the comments but I know there is someone calling it a red flag here. He is being an ass but not abusive is my point lol.", "Go on, name them please.", "it does sound shes beying hypocrite about it. Shes talking all this high horse stuff about objecting women in the songs he listen, but then proceeds to do the same thing but for men. OP and OP GF need to re evaluate their boundaries", "i mean i would be understanding if she was against the sexist lyrics all together but it sounds like shes listening to the same type of degrading music just about men instead so shes being a huge hypocrite. if shes against degrading music then she shouldn\u2019t listen to stuff like that either.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

It shouldn't be an excuse to allow prejudice to anyone with the single reason as being the other gender and that they were never that opressed. 2 wrongs don't make 1 right. Its being inconsiderate with the others because you're doing the same thing you complained (generalized) so much about.  \n\n\nOP should evaluate if his choices of songs cost a whole relationship. Also talk about it with your partner! because clearly you got some unresolved feelings about her choices of songs too.", "Women are not oppressed. Women can do anything a man can do. But please keep the victim mentally alive and well.", "Right but it\u2019s one thing to get a headache from something it\u2019s another thing to just not like it. Also we don\u2019t know that she\u2019s necessarily willing to compromise. Based off OP example of a song she doesn\u2019t like that is very tame in comparison to other rap songs. She can\u2019t even handle the mild stuff..", "If she believes what she\u2019s telling the OP then those lyrics should be problematic *to her.* The song ends with the singer killing her ex and his girlfriend and happily thinking about their dead bodies.", "I personally don't listen to rap, but I know there is. They get praised for their take on men but men are sexist when they do it.", "Honestly i feel like this might be a joke comment, have you ever heard kf the women rap scene? With cardi b? Megan the stallion? Literally any female rapper? Its what gets them views and listens because hot girl summer. I understand that u dont like men who rap about women and so do i but dont sit here and act like no women has ever made fun do a man in music, it\u2019s absolutely stupid.", "Lol not one???", "There actually are many, many, many.

I don't know why that is, but I'm not deeply invested in using the term. Cheers.", "Oh, awesome! You\u2019ve changed my worldview entirely.", "We made a list of artists we both can agree on. They could look into this. \n\nLike try a bunch and if one doesn't like the song or artist, that doesn't go on the playlist. If it is, put it on there. Sometimes you just don't like the other person's song or music and just need to deal, too.", "ik i read that and was like have you never heard a song by literally any mainstream female rapper?? because women definitely degrade men in songs too", "Keep believing in that negativity in your life, you won't go far or be happy in life with that mindset.", "The other thing is this isn\u2019t his wife it\u2019s his girlfriend and it\u2019s his vehicle and he\u2019s doing her a favor.

It's hilarious how hard you're trying.", "Jokes on you I am a woman.", "I mean, we're all in the situation that if someone goes crazy then we can only deal with it, maybe try to mitigate your vulnerability?", "opportunity wise, probably now a days is 50/50, i wouldn't know. But living in a world where you know, that you're physical weak to all possible death & live scenarios, its something incomprehensible for most Men", "I think people think compromise just means I get what I want. Me putting my headphones on in the car to let my husband enjoy his music isn\u2019t a big deal for me. Maybe she should do that considering this isn\u2019t her car."]}
