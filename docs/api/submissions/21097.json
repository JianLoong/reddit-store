But, the load needs to be shared and it doesn't mean you should have to give up your entire summer.  Your trip is already arranged and paid for, you should go and enjoy yourself and shouldn't feel guilty.  I highly doubt your GM would want that either!  Other family members need to step up and help her too, especially while you are away.\n\nTo all those Reddit naysayers who will say you don't owe family anything and shouldn't help at all and should only think of yourself and should go NC with your family for even daring to ask for help... one day it WILL BE YOU in need of assistance!!  So remember your ranting when you've successfully isolated yourself from the rest of the world by treating everyone around you like garbage and no one willing to help you in your time of need.", "NTA.

I'm in a similar situation where my grandmother needed to move into my family home for care. It first started out as a promise that I wouldn't be needed much, but since I was seen as the \"young and available\" one, i started to get roped into caring for her more and more. It's a slippery slope, so I recommend trying to hold your boundaries now.

Taking 4 days especially since it\u2019s already paid and planed isn\u2019t that big of a deal. Just help when you can.

You are not a child anymore, you are an adult who is fully capable of pitching in for a family crisis.  You think your aunt, uncle and father wouldn\u2019t also like to relax this summer?

I wake up almost every day at 4:30 to work and then come home and do school work.... so sorry for putting myself forward this one time.
