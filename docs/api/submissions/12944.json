He always had some elaborate tale for all of us about the things he had gotten up to while he was away and teenage skepticism didn't come into play here for once. I idolized him then and I still do now. Both of my parents worked, typically long hours, so I would spend a considerable amount of time with my bonus family since \"second mom\" stayed at home.

You expect your life partner who is also the mother to these kids to send the kids to a home where she disagrees with the parenting style for weeks at a time? While she is nowhere near them and neither are you? That is absurd. Blood relative or not. Your intentionally vague responses lead me to believe that your allegiance lies with friend and \u2018second family\u2019 over her and you are just trying to tow the line as much as possible. Also, as a mom, sending your kids off for multiple weeks at a time can be difficult to swallow even when you have sent them to camp before. You think it\u2019s a good idea because for whatever reason you ended up being practically raised by these people when you had your own family so you think your kids should have the same experience. That isn\u2019t a \u2018life experience\u2019 anyone needs. What I\u2019m certain your wife has told you that plays into your vagueness here is that she can\u2019t be there to handle any emotions that may arise due to how these people \u2018parent\u2019 nor can she be there quickly if there is any sort of issue. Allowing access to your children when she is there and can monitor interactions is one thing, allowing full unrestricted access to your kids where they can\u2019t stop something bad nor can either of you get there in a reasonable amount o time is entirely something else. If she is hesitant to allow this, she has a gut feeling and you need to respect that. And no she shouldn\u2019t be responsible for being the \u2018bad guy\u2019. You jumped the gun knowing what she thinks of them and wanted to use that as a reason to allow them to go. That\u2019s gross manipulation. YTA", "YTA. 6 and 8 are pretty young to go somewhere for a couple of weeks without parents, and it feels manipulative and petty on your part to have tried to get the kids on your side before discussing the plans with your wife. For big decisions like this, you talk to your wife and get on the same page, then you tell the kids. You don't tell the kids, assume you'll get your way and then tell your wife it's her fault that the kids are disappointed. You did that, not her.\n\nThat being said, it seems there's a bigger issue I think you and your wife need to communicate about why she feels uncomfortable around these people, why she doesn't trust them to watch the kids (and to be fair, it could be as simple as that she doesn't know them very well), and how you can build a relationship in a way that makes you both feel comfortable.", "INFO is there any reason why you need your children to be away for a couple of weeks?", "YTA \n\nThis is part of having a united front as parents.

I think you kinda fucked yourself here, my dude. You guys should be a united front when telling your kids the news, or you can try an alternative route in allowing your wife and your bonus family to become more familiar with each other.", "YTA. You\u2019re trying to play your kids against your wife. Good parents don\u2019t do that. Once they agree to a decision, whether it was their first choice or not, they present a united front to the kids, especially when the kids are as young as yours.  Second, your wife is allowed to be protective of her young children & not want to send them to another state to stay with people she doesn\u2019t know well & or trust completely.

I would never let kids that young stay for \"weeks\" in another state with anyone else, much less someone that I'm not close to.\n\nYou screwed up by telling your kids they could go without clearing it with your wife first.

This should have been a joint discussion with your wife from the very beginning, and now you're trying to make her the bad guy when in reality you overstepped.", "YTA.

If you said no to that, then definitely big time YTA. If that's not the case I would still say YTA but less so. I understand you want your children to have this opportunity but telling them ahead of time before okaying it with your wife is a big nono in my book. You knew she felt uncomfortable with this idea in the first place so it was foolish of you to tell them before her. Also - a couple of weeks is a loooong time for children that young. I understand you don't want to have to break this news to them, but putting it all on your wife is not only going to create a rift between you and her, but it might also create a rift between her and her children if they see that you two disagree on the topic.

Has something happened with them in the past? Have you told her something about them that she might not agree with? There has to be some reason why. In saying that she's a minor ah as she just said no without giving any real reason as to why just saying she doesn't trust them which again leads me to believe that something that has happened.\n\nBut you need to respect your wife's wishes and support and talk to her about why she doesn't want them going. You said a few weeks during the summer which is quite a while which is majorly different than a week or a few days.\n\nHave you ever thought that maybe she just wanted to spend the summer with the kids. You need to sit down and have a proper conversation with her and communicate your thoughts with her and then listen to her thoughts on the situation as well.\n\nYou are a majorly huge ah though simply for where you said, \"My children overheard me when I was discussing this with him over the phone, so I told them about the possible plans since I didn't see any reason for their mom to say no now.\"\n\nYou understand this is wrong on so many levels. you expected her to just say yes and cart your kids off to people that she doesn't trust simply because you told them about the potential trip thinking that she couldn't say no to them.\n\nMinor asshole to her Major asshole to you, I suggest that you sit down and have a conversation with her about it with her try and get to the root of the problem.

You know she doesn\u2019t trust these people the way you do and wasn\u2019t comfortable sending your kids there, there was no reason to get them hyped for a trip you weren\u2019t even sure was happening.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ywlvo/aita_for_forcing_my_wife_to_deliver_bad_news_to/jd9xbg1?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3", "The missing missing reason", "Can you really not see how your wife rightfully doesn't want to send her children away for weeks to people who deliberately undermine her parenting style? It doesn't matter if you see it as harmful or not, your kids are at an impressionable age. And instead of reassuring her that these people are going to respect her input and uphold the type of discipline the kids are used to, You just seem to think it's a game. \n\nI wouldn't let them go either to people who deliberately undermine me and turn me into the bad guy. YTA \n\nAlso, your relationship with these people and your best friend is a little sus. You should be supporting your wife and making compromises to bridge the gap between them, instead all you're doing is digging your feet in and making your wife look like the bad guy.", "He\u2019s not their grandfather. He\u2019s a guy that you love, but only YOU are the one with that relationship. Not your wife, not your kids.", "[deleted]", "If she doesn\u2019t agree with their parenting style, why would she entrust your kids to them for \u201ca few weeks\u201d that seems like a good reason not to send them", "OP, does your wife have good reason to believe that your friend was/is romantically interested in you and what if anything was done to prevent boundary pushing by him into your relationship?", "You've spent time with these people and know them, not your wife. Her bottom line is she doesn't like them or trust them and that's ok. For you to plan all of this behind her back and then blame her for saying no, is really messed up.  Yta and your arguments aren't doing you any favors. It just shows how unreasonable you are.", "WOOF.", "Why do you want them to fly to this family for a few weeks? \n\nAnd just to be sure you know this, YOU are the one who told the kids about the trip before discussing it with your wife. Therefore, YOU are the one letting them down. They are very young to spend that much time that far away from their parents. You say the kids view this family as grandparents, but how much of their 6-8 years have they actually spent around them? \n\nI'm not shitting on \"found family.\" God knows blood family can be horrible. But you started this. You've been vague about both why you want the kids to go and why your wife doesn't, and you're the one who spilled the beans before plans were finalized. Yta.", "But they're not his family, regardless how he sees them. They're very close family friends. And just because he trusts them with his life, he does not automatically get to entrust his them with his children's life. Two parents are responsible for a child, and if one of them is uncomfortable handing a child over to \"family friends\" then that's final. OP is being a baby here and doesn't understand that parenting is a team effort", "They're family friends, and as far as the wife is concerned, yes they are strangers. OP cannot see that his wife' maternal instinct is telling her not to do it, and she's right", "Yes.  He's being deliberately vague with those details, probably because they justify her attitude.", "OP seems to have deliberately left out important details in the original post.  Hmmm!", "Stonewalling and lying to your husband isn't recommended for a good relationship.\n\nShe needs to put her big girl pants on and own up to her parenting decisions.", "Most of these problems were years ago prior to us having kids or getting married. They just generally didn't get along and I would take his side in some of the arguments that took place. It's since been resolved as best as it can be, they're civil and mostly steer clear of one another. The arguments were never about anything serious either, there was button pushing from them both and arguments over one or the other monopolizing my time, things like that.", "My oldest went to a week away camp last summer. They do overnight stays with grandparents / friends occasionally, too. I wouldn't say he's been around them unsupervised for long periods, but he has watched them overnight before.", "And there it is", "My children *do* have a close relationship with that side of my family and have always referred to them using grandpa/grandma \\[last name\\], the same as they do with my parents and my wife's.", "He can call the guy whatever he wants, wtf, isnt it \"friends are your chosen family\"?", "A relationship between them already exists.", "This is such a bizarre take lol. He says the kids have always called them grandma/grandpa. I call my dad\u2019s best friend my uncle, should he have been chastised for \u201ccreating a relationship\u201d between us that didn\u2019t otherwise exist?", "He and I moved to the same city for our college and again for our post college years, but we don't live nearby to one another anymore. We used to see each other nearly every day, but that has since stopped since I got married and had children and he got caught up with his career. I'd say we see each other in person every other week or so.", "In another comment he said this friend showed romantic interest in him and now we all wonder why the wife doesn\u2019t trust him.", "Agree OP doesn\u2019t get to make unilateral decisions on the children, but disagree that these individuals should be treated as lesser than his biological family, or the implication that biological family are inherently better or more trustworthy than others.", "That's not why she said no. She's afraid that the guy traveling with them has the hots for her husband. Read the linked comment above.", "Sure, stonewalling and lying to your spouse aren\u2019t good things to do to a spouse. \n\nHow does that change the point that your recommendation isn\u2019t how successful parenting works? No parenting relationship has ever been made better by one parent vilifying the other unnecessarily. Nor is there any reason to believe the wife is actually being unreasonable in her stance that the kids shouldn\u2019t stay with these people.", "OP, the fact that you\u2019re being very vague here makes me think it\u2019s actually pretty bad or that your wife has a valid reason to not like your friend or trust his family. In which case, YTA.\n\nIf this is not the case, you need to give us more information. Right now you\u2019re just reminding me of every post here where a guys \u201cbest friend\u201d ends up being his fuck buddy and he\u2019s throwing his wife to wolves while discovering his sexuality late in life.", "You're being deliberately vague about a lot of things here including why your wife doesn't trust them, and it doesn't make you look good here.  \n\nThis should have been a joint decision from the start.  From the very start.  That was on you.  You need to own your fuck up instead of trying to be the \"fun parent\" while making your wife the bad cop.", "So that\u2019s a \u201cno\u201d to spending long periods of time away. I\u2019m assuming that week away camp wasn\u2019t also a plane ride away as well. \n\nIt\u2019d be one thing if you and your wife were going to be relatively close by if they had an unexpected \u201cI\u2019m ready to come home,\u201d that\u2019s not really possible in this situation. That\u2019s just too big of a trip for a first time imo.\n\nAnd yes, YTA. You\u2019re one half of the parenting set, you show up for the fun and not fun (And stop trying to pull an end-around for medium-big decisions. It\u2019ll save you from future assholery.)", "Okay but that still doesn\u2019t really answer why she doesn\u2019t trust him. She thought he was interested in her husband romantically when they were in their twenties\u2026but why does she not trust him?", "I'd say because of this, it's weird that you're wife isn't OK with them going.\n\nHowever, you should BOTH tell your kids. Together. \n\nYou should be a unified parental force, not \"Oh well im the cool dad but your monster mom said no\". \n\nSo, YTA. If your parental decisions are unified (which it seems like they are), then you need to present them unified.", "This isn\u2019t an answer to my question. At all. \n\nDoes your wife have good reason to believe that your best friend is/was romantically interested in your and what if anything has been done to make sure that no boundaries are pushed by him in your relationship?", "If that's the only reason, then she'd be acting a bit crazy. I still think OP is TA for not talking to the wife first", "He's not vilifying her. He simply telling her to stand by her own decision. To own up to her own parenting. If her parenting is so on point why is she so ashamed to take credit for it.", "For lack of a better phrase, the whole thing was pretty much two people in their 20s having a pissing contest. They're both set in their ways about things and they both liked arguing for the sake of arguing. People like that can either be the best of friends or get on each other's nerves terribly, and for them it was the latter.", "You're right, it doesn't. But because we had to drag this information from OP, it tells me that the wife likely has a good reason to be distrustful. \n\nMaybe the romance was reciprocated? Maybe friend is trying to insert themselves in OPs life a little too much. Maybe there is a pattern of sidelining wife for friends and family.", "So OP is automatically the asshole in any situation where it is him against a woman, got it. Reddit is just stickin with what it does best!", "They are not [strang](https://strangers.Is)ers. Is english not your first language?\n\nAnd he didn't tell them about the plans, they OVERHEARD the phone conversation.\n\nPlease, please get a dictionary or avail yourself of an online one more often.", "This, again, is purposefully vague which leads me to think you\u2019re covering for one of these people in some way or another. So give us a specific example/examples or continue to bare the cost of the vagueness. There isn\u2019t any reason why your friend should be getting in a pissing contest with your romantic partner unless one party did something egregious, so who was it?", "Yeah could be. I guess this doesn\u2019t really have anything to do with the answer anyway. He still should present a united front with the wife to the kids", "Absolutely not! If she had done something like this behind his back it would be equally asshole-ish behavior. Let me say it once more, when children have two parents, both parents decide (together) what's best for the child. If OP felt he would be uncomfortable with his kids travelling and staying with his wife's family friends, he would be completely within his rights.", "I could ammend my verdict to ESH (wife for lying about her reasons, OP for not discussing with his wife first) if that would make you happier", "OP says the children overheard him on the phone and then he told them about the plans because he thought there would be no way his wife could say no now. Not exactly the same thing.", "Are you seriously telling me I have problems reading english, when you're the one who couldn't figure out the implied meaning of \"strangers\" in this context? For the record, I speak three languages fluently. What's more, you couldn't even figure out how to post a comment without accidentally hyperlinking it to nothing. Take your monolingual condescending attitude elsewhere please.", "She thought he was interested in me romantically.", "I think the fact that he always took the friends side instead of the wife\u2019s is a big problem too", "Agree. OP is TA just for that.", "sure", "well yeah I mean obviously be truthful in your judgment and dont let \\[not feminism, for sure\\] get in the way of that? like, of course, this is the whole thing i was talking about\n\nShe can't communicate like a grown up, she is keeping her kids from a great time because of some insecurities from decades ago, and is acting pretty terrible all around, but OP is the asshole? this place i swear...", "Yes. they overheard him. They OVERHEARD him. And then he fleshed it out. You can't understand that can you?\n\nDad: So you'd be willing to fly with them to Massachusetts this summer.?\n\nKids: Are we going to Grandpa Jones!!!!!!\n\nDad: Well heck kids you shouldn't eavesdrop on phone calls but Uncle Glenn is willing to take you to Granpa and Granma Jones this summer.\n\nor\n\nDad: You didn't hear anything. Go to bed. Honey?????", "Holy fuck are you kidding? That\u2019s the \u201cpissing contest\u201d? \n\nAnd was he? Or, more specifically did she have valid reason to think that he might be romantically interested in you?", "That\u2019s not a pissing contest. I think your wife\u2019s opinion should be listened to here.", "INFO: Is/was he?", "INFO: Is she homophobic or was it just a competitive thing?", "That\u2019s not a pissing contest.  Your explanations don\u2019t really make sense.", "Right but a suspected crush from years ago isn\u2019t really a reason to not trust the guy is it? I mean I think OP should handle it a different way, don\u2019t get me wrong. But what about him possibly having feeling for her husband makes him not to be trusted in general? Unless she thinks an affair is going to happen I guess", "Just a competitive thing, to my knowledge."]}
