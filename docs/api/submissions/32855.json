Obviously I was happy to purchase some additional and found it really sweet he wanted to share with everyone.\n\nI didn\u2019t think about it at the time of purchase since we were mid holiday in a different country, however when we were back and I was packing my sons bag for his first day back at school I suddenly remembered that\nhe has one classmate, let\u2019s call him Joe, who has a gluten allergy and wouldn\u2019t be able to eat these biscuits. But it was too late for me to do anything about this, it was late and shops were closed so I wouldn\u2019t be able to buy an alternative plus they wouldn\u2019t be from Japan anyway and would be from the local supermarket. I also wouldn\u2019t have had time to pick any up in the morning because i work full time.\n\nSon was happy bringing them to school and said everyone also enjoyed them. However I got an angry phone call from Joe\u2019s mum saying that I shouldn\u2019t have let my son bring in those biscuits knowing that her son would be excluded. She said that I should cater to allergies especially children\u2019s allergies, which I would understand if it was say for example peanut allergy which is life threatening, but should gluten intolerance be treated with the same extreme caution?\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I was the AH for still allowing my son to bring in the biscuits despite me knowing one kid wouldn\u2019t be able to have any?\n\nUPDATE for info: I know about joes intolerance because it\u2019s happened before with other parents bringing in classroom snacks and events. Joe would not eat any of the snacks brought in unless it\u2019s been made 100% sure there\u2019s no gluten in it and when there\u2019s been a school event I think they always have something separate for him. For the biscuits my son brought in the ingredients were in Japanese so the teacher let Joe know and he did not have any", "created_utc": 1702343366, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18g9pz4/aita_for_allowing_my_child_to_bring_in_souvenir/", "score": 1615, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Saying that it\u2019s your fault and your son shouldn\u2019t have brought sweets because of the allergies of one kid it\u2019s so unfair.

Your kid is not the end all be all for all kids, people have their different beliefs and they should also be respected instead of silenced.

I still slip up even living with a coeliac. One of the other issues is that labelling may not show that gluten could be present because the snack is made in the same facility as gluten products, which could cause cross-contamination.

You DID think about the issue the night before. I think it would have been best to go to a shop in the morning or, if that wasn't possible, hold off on sending the treats to school until you had a chance to buy a substitute for Joe. It wouldn't matter that it wasn't from Japan--kids want treats and it's hard to watch the other kids all eat treats while you just sit there.  \n\nThe teacher, frankly, shouldn't have let these get passed out without rounding up something for Joe as well.  I'm surprised it's not a school policy.\n\nFinally, I'm all for Joe's mom advocating for him, but she's not doing him any favors by waging wars with other parents over biscuits.

Not fair!\"", "My kid has celiac disease and he cannot eat anything that even might be cross contaminated with gluten. If he does, he gets really sick and misses school for several days.

However, please understand that all allergies should be treated with caution, regardless of whether or not they're life threatening.\n\nI see other commenters saying it should've been postponed, but it really shouldn't because of one damn student.

Like full blown anaphylactic shock and have an emergency epipen allergic. And guess what I don\u2019t expect others to cater to my allergy, that\u2019s a me problem not an everybody else problem. Like the most I ever do is as a caregiver, if a resident wants a chocolate based treat, I ask a coworker who has a free moment. But even then, I\u2019m still willing to put on gloves and a mask so I\u2019m not directly touching or smelling the chocolate if my coworkers can\u2019t help me. Then for extra safety I wash my hands throughly with soap and warm water. Like the 1 person who ever really \u201ccaters\u201d to my allergy is my mama and she either eats chocolate out of the house or doesn\u2019t keep chocolate in the house. But that being said, I never ask her too so that for me, that\u2019s something my mama CHOOSES to do for me. Because in her eyes, she doesn\u2019t want to see her get so sick she needs to be hospitalized. So for her (in my mama\u2019s word not mine) \u201cchoosing between you/your health and chocolate isn\u2019t even a question, as my daughter, you will always come before me wanting chocolate\u201d. But that just goes to show a mamas love though. Because again, I wouldn\u2019t ask her to sacrifice chocolate for me.

Heck my own grandma just sent me Christmas fudge with walnuts in it. It really sucks but it\u2019s also my problem, and not everyone else\u2019s. \n\nAlthough i will say that there have been times in my life where someone did remember and it made me so incredibly happy.

Life's not fair, but it is significantly more unfair for those with medical complications and disabilities.  The least you could do was provide a biscuit.", "YTA.

After the last time, I said nty I'm gluten free, she and her daughter, researched flour alternatives made me some brownies using a mix of flours. One of them being almond. I took the brownie, thanked her and took a bite. When my skin started to burn I asked what flours were used instead of wheat flour. I gave the brownie to hubs who gladly finished it and gave my friend a hug and thanked her for her wonderful effort but told her I was allergic to nuts too. She now has a list of my allergies cause daughter and her want to make me something for Xmas. \n\nIn short I don't expect people to make an effort but when they do I really appreciate it", "Yeah, YTA.

If you are going to send things to school with your child, you need to make sure that everyone is included in some capacity (even if not in the exact same way - it doesn't matter if the accommodated snack is not from Japan).  If it doesn't include everyone, then it shouldn't be sent.  Period.

Just a thought.\n\nIf I was the parent of that Allergy kid (I am a parent of an allergy kid though haha) and they felt left out I'd just make them feel extra special by finding a different treat for them after school and making it fun for him.\n\nTo me this is more of a ESH situation: as an allergy parent I think she was out of line, but I also think if you really were concerned about him feeling left out you'd just push the cookies by one little day.", "I\u2019m going to go with ESH. \n\nI taught last year and had a kid in my class who had celiac disease. When a parent would send in treats with their kid, they would message me and I\u2019d send a message to that kid\u2019s parent so they knew there would be a special treat and they could send something in with him that was safe for him to eat. That\u2019s probably would should have happened here, but the kid\u2019s mom shouldn\u2019t have called you yelling at you about it. \n\nAlso, as a teacher, surprise treats were a nightmare.

Obviously I was happy to purchase some additional and found it really sweet he wanted to share with everyone.\n\nI didn\u2019t think about it at the time of purchase since we were mid holiday in a different country, however when we were back and I was packing my sons bag for his first day back at school I suddenly remembered that\nhe has one classmate, let\u2019s call him Joe, who has a gluten allergy and wouldn\u2019t be able to eat these biscuits. But it was too late for me to do anything about this, it was late and shops were closed so I wouldn\u2019t be able to buy an alternative plus they wouldn\u2019t be from Japan anyway and would be from the local supermarket.\n\nSon was happy bringing them to school and said everyone also enjoyed them. However I got an angry phone call from Joe\u2019s mum saying that I shouldn\u2019t have let my son bring in those biscuits knowing that her son would be excluded. She said that I should cater to allergies especially children\u2019s allergies, which I would understand if it was say for example peanut allergy which is life threatening, but should gluten intolerance be treated with the same extreme caution?\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I was the AH for still allowing my son to bring in the biscuits despite me knowing one kid wouldn\u2019t be able to have any?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I'm not clear on whether Joe has an actual allergy-- wheat allergies can be just as dangerous as a nut allergy, and the reaction sounds like an allergy. One instance of the entire class getting an exciting treat while you're excluded is no big deal but an entire childhood of it isn't great. There were several things you could have done-- waited a day so the teacher could ask Joe's parents to send something for him to eat at the same time,  asked the mom directly if there was something you could send, etc. I know it feels like your son wanted to do something kind and share, and someone rained on the parade.

Empathy towards food allergies, including gluten intolerance, is an act of kindness. The impact of gluten on one's health, such as the destruction of the gut lining and malabsorption issues, is significant. Personally, I suffer from malabsorption due to childhood exposure to gluten, a time when gluten intolerance wasn't widely recognized. This has led to me being underweight, vitamin & mineral deficient, and experiencing extensive pain from gluten-containing foods, a common experience for those with gluten sensitivities. It effects my quality of life so gluten sensitivity and intolerance isn\u2019t a minor thing. My case is considered a mild case. There are many in worse shape then me. \n\nWhile it's crucial to acknowledge the challenges faced by those with allergies, it's also important to understand that last-minute issues can arise, making it challenging to provide gluten-free alternatives. Living with a food allergy often means accepting that there will be instances where one misses out on certain foods.\n\nAttacking or guilt-tripping someone for not offering alternatives, especially in unexpected situations, is equally discourteous. It's essential to foster understanding and patience, recognizing that accommodating food allergies requires thoughtful planning, and sometimes, unforeseen circumstances can limit immediate alternatives.", "NTA. What an excellent opportunity for this kid to learn how to navigate the real world where every person and occasion will not be catering to his intolerance.

It's a very odd allergy, and we have epi pens on hand. My son had to learn to avoid it. He knows to ask each and every time. Ironically, the only time he's had something with cinnamon was when he was served a crisiont by the school cafeteria. I think the lunch ladies truly thought his medical alert bracelet was for show! There is less risk of cross contamination, though I do have to be careful what bakeries we use. The school knows, his teachers know, but ultimately, it's on him to be safe. This isn't an allergy that's going to go away. Would he be sad not to get cool food from another country absolutely.  But better sad than dead. It's easy enough to find another snack for an allergy kid, or if the allergy is that extreme, then it's on the parents to provide some snacks. I do not expect other parents to provide for my son, I simply expect the school to be aware and not make him eat anything he shouldn't. I expect him to be aware, to ask. We've drilled it into his head. It wasn't an easy lesson, but it's a lifelong allergy he has to learn to manage. Even when that means he has to manage his feelings if he does get left out.

No gluten, no soy, no peanuts, no dairy, no corn syrup, no sugar, no dyes, must be organic with no imitations, etc. and it\u2019s comedic thing was how insane an expectation it was \u2014 because what could you possibly make that caters to every known allergy and intolerance on the planet??\n\nIdk, my point being it sounds like this mom wants the world to cater to her child rather than make the necessary accommodations herself in order to keep her child informed and included.  She would be friends with this PTA mom, and unfortunately that\u2019s just not how the world works.", "NTA. I know the kids are young and chances are she's new to this, but it's his mom's job to make sure the teacher has separate treats for him available for when this inevitably happens.", "Like yes, it's hard to be the odd kid out \u2014 I have lots of food allergies and it's very nice to be included, but also almost no one ever caters to me, and I don't get upset if someone brings in something I can't have. It's going to be like this for the rest of his life \u2014\u00a0the parents should send suitable treats for him to have on hand, like others suggested, but even with that he'll never be able to be \"included.\" Do we really give no kids treats if one kids has an allergy? Do we really not bring any Japanese food to school to try because one kid can't eat it? It's part of it, it sucks, and there should be ways to cater to him but he'll always know he's excluded either way. I'm not offended when someone eats something I can't have, and learning that young, accepting when something just isn't mine or for me, has gone a long way. I get the parents looking out for him, but they can also do that in different ways than by making sure no other kids get to join in if he can't too.", "NTA - I get that other parents want their kids to be included and everything all the time and they want the world to be perfect and nice and inclusive but that's not reality. \n\nIf you have a food allergy you will be excluded from certain dishes. If you're allergic to dogs you probably can't go to a dog park. \n\nLife is not fair and sometimes it's annoying but the quicker we learn this as children the more we realize that the world does not cater to us and that we are not entitled. \n\nI think this is a great learning opportunity for this kid with gluten issues. There will probably be pizza parties in that kids future that they will not be able to partake in and the quicker they realize they just need to suck it up, the easier they're going to take it.", "NTA\u2026 also, send this thread to Joes mom and let her know you\u2019re not gonna cater to her stupidity either.", "NTA.

I spent about 10 years working with kids in various settings, and the absolute consensus among parents of allergy kids was \u201cplease just don\u2019t feed them, we\u2019ll send what they need.\u201d The stakes are too high and there\u2019s too much room for mistakes, which can be deadly.

It was pizza and Jamba Juice. I couldn't eat the pizza. The Jamba Juice smoothie chosen had aspartame in it. The school lunch that day was burgers. My parents had to be called so they could arrange for someone to bring me food. It was humiliating and absolutely shattered me.  \nSmall moments make a huge impact.

Of course with celiac you can still enjoy snacks, just not the gluten variety so it may seem more unfair, but it is a reality this kid will have to learn to accept because as an adult, things will be unfair no matter how much he gets upset or someone gets upset on his behalf.\n\nSure it sucked that a kid specifically didn't get to partake in the Japanese snacks. But if everyone accommodates him and then suddenly stops once he's 18 or 20 or something, then he's in for a world of hurt.

OP isn't at fault and neither is her son for not double checking every single detail about kiddos classmates while on vacation, because it isn't their responsibility.
