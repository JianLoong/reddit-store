I applaud you for putting your foot down and encourage you to continue doing so. Once you've said no a few times, it gets easier and you'll feel better with yourself. All the best.", "People may disagree with me on this, but NTA.\n\nThat\u2019s her kids, not yours. That\u2019s her responsibility, not yours. You have the right to say no.", "NTA. She isn't asking, she is DEMANDING.  Even if she is paying you, you are not obligated to be at her beck and call for babysitting.  If you do not put your foot down, she is going to take advantage of you and walk all over you. \n\nIf she says she will drop the kids off anyway, tell her you will call the police for child abandonment. Hopefully it won't come to that but be prepared if it does.  There have been other stories similar to yours here on reddit. A sibling just drops off their kids at a brother or sister's house with no regard to the plans their sibling has. Some of them have had to call the police for child abandonment to put a stop to being made unwilling babysitters.", "NTA- you are not babysitter on demand. You are allowed your own time.", "Nta at all.  Your sister is manipulative and is taking advantage of you.", "NTA.  Please try to learn a lesson that I, more than twice your age, am still working on learning:\n\nNo is a complete sentence.\n\nYou don't need to justify or explain why you don't want to babysit.  You said no.  That's it.  That's all you need to say.  \n\n\nETA:  I may feel a little differently if she's working and you are her regular babysitter, so suddenly saying no leaves her scrambling, but I get the impression that isn't the case.  Sounds like she gets you to babysit when she has something fun to do.", "NTA - those children are not your responsibility, they are your sisters. If the answer is no, then the answer is no, and she needs to respect that.", "NTA. Good on you for being firm. Probably a good idea to leave for the night but you shouldn't have to. Be very clear with sister that if she drops your nieces off after you've said no that she will regret it as you will report her. Let your family know in advance that you've said no to your sister and she is threatening to desert her children with you. Don't give her a chance to bad mouth you first. Stand your ground and don't feel guilty.", "NTA - she asked and you said no. . She did not respect you or your boundaries. Totally unhealthy on her end", "Keep that spine nice and shiny and stand tall don't be a doormat", "NTA\n\nYour sister can\u2019t expect you to babysit her kids all the time and needs to accept it when you say no. She can\u2019t force her kids on you.", "NTA\n\nYou did a great job standing up for yourself!", "NTA - Her kids are her responsibility, not yours.  You have every right to say no and you are under no obligation to give her the reason why you cannot babysit on a particular night.  Your sister needs to learn to plan ahead and schedule babysitting with you in advance... that way, if you also have plans, she has time to find someone else to babysit.  I understand that sometimes, last minute plans occur where she might call and ask you on short notice; however, you need to remind her that YOU ARE NOT the one who went out and had a kid... SHE DID!  Her kid is HER problem, NOT YOURS, and you are under absolutely no obligation to drop YOUR plans for HER kid.\n\nBear in mind, however... favors are a two-way street.  At some point in the future, you may need a favor from your sister.  If and when you do, she may decide to use your decision not to help her with babysitting as an excuse to decline your request.  Regardless of that fact, your sister shouldn't be using you as her last minute babysitter and taking advantage of you by assuming you don't have anything better to do.", "NTA \n\nPractice saying No and leaving it at that. No explanation and No excuses. Just. No!\n\nSister should be happy yiu already babysat.\n\nMake some rules. Like oncer per weekend during the day time. She has a from and to time and the moment she doesn't pick them up on time, she loses your services for a month or two. \n\nThat or start making yourself busy. Go to the library, mall, a friend's. Anything to not be at home. Make it so your sister doesn't know the hours that you keep. \n\nThat's for if she doesn't accept the no.", "NTA you aren\u2019t required to babysit for anyone! Your sister is absolutely in the wrong here.\n(Edit: I want to add that I\u2019m SO glad that you left!! She was just going to force you to watch them! How terrible!!)", "NTA.  It\u2019s not your job to watch her kids, so she can go out and get all her holes filled.", "NTA, and if your mom enables this behavior by bailing your sister out, that's on her.  It would be a long time before I babysat for sis again.", "NTA\n\nInform her of your hourly rate next time.", "NTA as a mom to 4 kids with a younger, child-free sister, I cannot imagine behaving this way. It\u2019s so gross. It\u2019s nice to help out but it\u2019s ok to say no.", "NTA and well done for learning \"no\" at such a young age. I'm 38 and still struggling with saying no sometimes", "Definitely NTA.\nDoesn't your sister understand that when you become a parent that you have to make sacrifices for your children.\nThis includes not going out socialising at the drop of a hat.\nEven  when you babysat, she didn't return home until 3 a.m., which is totally inconsiderate.\nShe needs to be told that you need a social life too.\nWhat happens when you go off to college/ university later this year?\nIs she going to  leave them with your mom all of  the time?\nSomeone needs to tell her the truth that she needs to grow up and stop thinking  she can go out every weekend like she probably did before becoming a mother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
