Usually they take in either young kids or non-problematic ones, but recently they took in a 16 year old boy, I\u2019ll call him \u201cAce\u201d for the sake of anonymity.\n\nAs far as I know, Ace comes from a very troubled background. He has some mental health issues and developmental difficulties, and he\u2019s already been to youth prison at the age of 16. In my opinion, his foster parents are very lenient about controlling him as I\u2019ve seen him multiple times smoking a vape in their back garden.\n\nA year ago and my wife bought a very expensive luxury car that costed about 50 thousand dollars. We keep it in our driveway as our neighbourhood is relatively safe. A few days ago, Ace stole his foster parents\u2019 car and crashed it into our car, which ended up getting our car totalled as the damage was too bad. It also destroyed their car, the kid wasn\u2019t hurt only by sheer luck.\n\nI decided to press charges against Ace. His foster parents begged me to not do it, saying that he\u2019s in counselling and they\u2019re working on his issues. They offered to pay for the repairs and to contribute to getting a new car as luckily they had insurance. In all honesty, I would\u2019ve appreciated if they paid me for the damage their lenience caused, but I think it would be fair if the young delinquent would\u2019ve be punished, so I refused to drop the charges even after they paid me. I told them that the kid is already a huge menace and I don\u2019t want a criminal in the making to get away with a serious crime and continue causing harm to others. They told me to give them the money back (it was $10k) and I said no because they paid me for their own poor control over a troubled teen, basically punishing themselves, and that the punishment for Ace would be decided by the state. I\u2019m positive that he will be locked up for a few years, but to be honest, I think he deserves it as he literally stole a vehicle, joyrode it, luckily didn\u2019t kill or injure anyone and crashed the vehicle into another, very expensive one.\n\nThey called me a massive a-hole, and my wife said I overreacted, that I should\u2019ve either drop the charges or give them the money back.\n\nEdit because I forgot to mention some important things: I was upfront with them that I won\u2019t drop the charges no matter how much they\u2019d pay me, they hoped that I\u2019ll change my mind when I get the money and they got mad when I didn\u2019t.

He stole ***his*** parents car, not yours. The collateral here sucks, but you were made whole and I'm not seeing a criminal complaint worth filing here. He's also going to face considerable challenges from this action being on his record regardless of if you press charges.\n\nDid police find him as ***deliberately*** crashing his car into yours as an attempt to destroy your car? Is there a history here with \"Ace\" doing other criminal actions against you to hate him so much?", "YTA you were going to press charges all along but mislead them to make money. \n\nETA I don\u2019t believe the edit added after all the YTA\u2019s", "I think YTA because you stated that the insurance paid you and you got 10 grand extra.\n\nYou arent pressing charges to get what you are owed you are doing it because you want to see a troubled child punished.\n\nPrisons literally create criminals. This kid isnt going to get better by being sent to prison hes far more likely to become stuck in a cycle of crime.\n\nHes a kid not a monster. What he did was wrong. And i wish there was a system where you could insist he gets actual support to stop him from doing this kind of thing again. But sadly there isnt.\n\nYou are within your legal rights to press charges but morally id say thats pretty horrible.", "YTA.  This is about revenge.  You're pissed and want the kid to hurt.  You also want to hurt the neighbors.  This has nothing to do with making sure others are protected.\n\nFurthermore, it sounds like you might have taken payment from them with the understanding that you would drop the charges.  If that's the case and you didn't drop the charges, you're stealing from them.", "I don\u2019t understand why you got paid 10k. If it was for you to not press charges, you absolutely are the AH for taking it and still pressing charges. If that was the reason they offered it, you should return the money. If they paid you simply for the inconvenience it caused you, then you\u2019re not wrong to keep it. As for pressing charges, I think it\u2019s necessary. My brother in law behaved exactly like this in his earlier teen years. He continued to have people give him slack, and now he\u2019s in prison for attacking his mom and step dad with a knife because he couldn\u2019t do whatever he wanted while living in their house. That kind of behavior needs there to be consequences. Far more often than not, when it goes unpunished, it either continues or escalates, which is already terrifying considering he could have killer someone with this incident.", "[removed]", "INFO\n\nSo rather than letting insurance cover it, you let them pay you ten grand, which if the car is 'totalled' isn't that not enough?", "YTA. On your side there were no real criminal actions. If their insurance and payment were going to make you whole for the vehicle collision, you should\u2019ve dropped it. It was their car that was stolen, they should\u2019ve pressed charges if they wanted to. If that wasn\u2019t going to make you whole, then press charges as you need a paper trail to recoup a monetary amount to make you whole.  \n\nAll you\u2019ve done is direct a child that has had no real upbringing into a system that is going to further his inability to function in general society. YTA, big time.", "I wasn't sure, but then I saw some of your responses to other people and you are, most definitely, an asshole. YTA. \n\nI don't know why you didn't just let insurance cover it and move on. Instead it seems like you are basically blackmailing the parents or something and going about this in a really shady way. Hell, you even think a 16 year old kid vaping in the back yard is a sign of them being too lenient in how they \"control\" this kid. Come on. \n\nLike, yeah, obviously what happened sucks and it's ridiculous this kid crashed into your nice car. But you have to know if someone is getting into a new foster home at 16, their life has not been easy whatsoever and you seem to want to further punish this kid even though insurance could have squared away this whole thing without going there.", "YTA - just sounds like revenge to me. You want \"the best for the kid\" let him go to counceling. If he get's \"looked up to learn his lesson\", he will probaply come out worse, because prison dosen't make better persons integration and rehabilitation does.\n\nWhy on earth would you take the 10K? You don't need them you got the insurance money, that's what insurance is for. You just want to punish the parents to.\n\n\"I don\u2019t have any issues with them as they paid for their negligence, the issue is the kid.\" Yes these evil parents dont look there kids up proerly and don't monitore them 24-7. You can't even say it's there \"parenting fauls\" if they took him as a foster child.", "YTA. And you're punishing these foster parents who are trying to help these kids. You didn't take this teenager's money, you took the foster parents' money. If you were consistent, you'd give the money back and pursue the teen in civil court.\n\nYou stole money from *foster parents*. In what world are you *not* TA?", "YTA- period. End of story. Massive asshole.", "LOL in what world is a $50k car a luxury car anymore? That\u2019s what a good number of Toyotas and Hyundais cost nowadays. YTA and you seem to have a superiority complex over these people when if you actually took a look at yourself you\u2019d realize you\u2019re not the one above them.", "You can\u2019t press charges. Only a DA can do that. You could certainly ask for them to do that but I don\u2019t believe they did. Is this rage bait? Are you lonely and just want people to interact with you?

I\u2019m not buying it.", "Individuals don\u2019t get the choice of pressing criminal charges, the state makes that choice.

You should have it insured properly AND park it in the garage.", "You're worried about a \"criminal in the making\" for crashing a car and vaping...and you feel the answer is to start him in the criminal system.\n\n\nI'd offer to show you the stats on how your action would actually set him off on a worse path, given that he's already a near adult in the foster system, but you only want your revenge.\n\n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\nIf a kid is in the foster system they\u2019ve generally lived through hell before making it to that point. \n\nHis foster parents are trying to help him. That takes time. You can\u2019t undo a lifetime of damage in a matter of weeks. \n\nYou\u2019d rather see him thrown in jail. There\u2019s no rehabilitation involved in jail/prison. He will come out worse off than he is now. \n\nHis foster parents are his last hope of having a healthy life. I\u2019m not saying it isn\u2019t possible to turn things around on his own later down the line, but it\u2019s unlikely without a strong support system. \n\nSo, yes, YTA. You extorted them and are now selfishly prosecuting this kid instead of allowing him to get real help.", "I can tell the exact kind of person OP is: Wealthy, snobbish, and condescending.", "YTA. What do you even mean by \"press charges\" in this case? Your car wasn't stolen. A kid driving without a license accidentally hit your car. Insurance paid for it. It's unlikely that he'll be charged with stealing his foster parents' car unless they reported it stolen; most teens who drive their parents' cars without permission aren't charged with theft. Whether to charge him with driving without a license based on the police report you made when the car was hit is up to the police at this point, and isn't about you.", "YTA. Extortion is a worse offense than joyriding a parent's car without permission and having a non-injury collision.  They are actively self-sacrificing to give a throwaway teen a chance, and you are using them aa a cash machine out of spite.", "yta its a minor sue the guardians why ruin the litle chance this child has", "You are pathetic.", "You are a horrible human.", "super massive AH", "YTA - you\u2019re extorting a foster child in a foster family\u2026 though I wouldn\u2019t expect more from an out of touch AH who buys a car for 50k for fuck sake. \ud83d\ude44\ud83e\udd2e", "In this,  YTA, bud.\n\n1.  The \"costed\" (cost) of your damaged vehicle plays no part in this. \n\n2.  If another person hit your car,  would you expect them to also pay you $10k, in addition to the insurance making you whole?  Smells like extortion when you have no right to persecute or impose penalties on another person outside of legal boundaries & the legal system. \n\n3.  Are you truly \"protecting society\" by pursuing charges against this child... in addition to the $10k (on top of insurance payments)  you were paid for the inconvenience the child's actions caused?   Seems vindictive. \n\n4.  Why did you take $10k from the family when you were going to pursue legal action against the child?   You could have chosen Civil Court for this,  but you probably knew you wouldn't get $10k from that. \n\n5.  There are plenty of kids who don't have the \"bag of hammers\" to haul around that THIS kid has who are making bad decisions & causing property damage.  \n\n6.  Have you even considered forgiving the child for a bad decision & using your expensive-car-lifestyle by mentoring & investing time in this child?   No.  You seem to care about getting paid & issuing compounding punishment to the child & his fostering family. \n\n7.  You've made an effort to highlight your \"very expensive car\" & this child's emotional & foster care status.   Why do you believe that warrants extra consequences for THIS child,  since those 2 factors are mentioned so often in your explanation of the situation. \n\n 8.  You seem to feel this child unworthy of forgiveness for his bad decision,  seemingly based on how expensive your car is & this child's emotional & foster status.   Do you have children?   If so,  are your children the only children in the world who don't do dumb shit?  \n\nYou are NOT helping society by putting this child in jail.  What this child needs is for people to invest themselves in teaching him that he can be forgiven & learn to make better decisions that will benefit him in his way- ahead.  He needs to know that people give a shit about him.  Or, is your expensive car- perfect people lifestyle not suited for that personal investment in a child that hasn't has the lifestyle you seem to boast about? \n\nAssholery 101, buddy.", "YTA. Sending \"Ace\" to prison isn't going to improve his behavior.", "QUESTION: They paid you or their insurance company paid?

So insurance is covering the car and they paid you 10k cahs ON TOP OF THAT, with the understanding that by paying you, you would dork the charges, they paid you, and you didn\u2019t drop the charges?! YTA! Like that\u2019s stealing and rude and just downright unnecessary. The kid is 16. Not 18. He has probably had a hard life (not saying that makes it ok) but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s going through ALOT and you adding to that just because you think he\u2019s a \u201cpunk\u201d. You\u2019re wife is right. Give them the money back or drop the charges. Or don\u2019t and stay the asshole, just know, you are indeed the AH!", "YTA, easy", "YTA.\n\nFirstly, lol, \"very expensive luxury car that costed about 50 thousand dollars\"... bad news friend, that's not a cheap car, but, come on. You said \"very expensive\" twice, so I just feel like maybe you need to reign in how important you think you are here. Insurance made you whole again and the neighbor even threw in for punitive damages. Your ego is overreacting here, a lot.\n\nAnyways, Ace sucks for making bad choices- but you said yourself he's got mental health *and* developmental issues. Those things need more work than jail- getting him arrested is exactly what would keep him in this cycle that your neighbors are trying to break. With a 16 year old foster kid, you've got to give a little because otherwise you'll get massive push back- vaping in the yard is pretty mild behavior. Do you know for sure this kid stole their car? Obviously he crashed it, but is he unlicensed and took the car without asking? Troubled teens stealing cars and crashing them isn't really as uncommon as it should be- but it's hardly a \"criminal in the making\". OP, take a moment and google \"teen takes car crash\"- this isn't a rarity- that doesn't make it okay, but take a breather and realize this kid didn't just hotwire a stranger's car here.\n\nYTA for accepting money for the damage, on top of their insurance about to pay for replacement of your car, AND then also wanting to further destroy a 16 year old's life you know nothing about.\n\nI can't stand anyone who would write off *a child* for good as though they have absolutely no chance of turning their lives around- and a foster kid in this situation didn't choose to have a sh\\*tty life, one was given to him to begin with. Shame on you for being so far up your own ass you can't see past your \"very expensive\" (again, LOL) car, and for wanting to make this kid \"pay\" as though his life hasn't been punishment enough. But it's clear that you don't care about this kid's life, so why the hell do you care if everything thinks you are an AH too?\n\nAND- finally, I don't even know on what grounds you'd succeed in pressing charges and why you want to go wasting money on a lawyer to cause problems for you, your neighbor, and this kid who is already clearly dealing with some shit. It was an accident, insurance responded... sounds like a civil court issue, and you've already got $10k from the neighbor, so what, you think you are gonna get this kid locked up? Doubt it.", "Yes, you are a massive AH. \n\nThis kid already grew up in the system, and you want to ruin his life more by pressing criminal charges. Kids make stupid mistakes, and you're going to make that follow him for the rest of his life. Thank God he does have to live with hurting someone.", "You most definitely are the asshole. And parts of your story do not make sense to me. If you bought a $50k car last year and it was totaled, how is it that $10k from the family makes you whole? And you said they have insurance. Why are they giving you cash? These people may be \"lenient\" but they are doing what most people would never think to do.

This differs dramatically from children who grow up in care, because their carers are actually taught to just phone the police. If I'd been living with a foster mum not a bio mum, I could've got a criminal damage charge for trashing the kitchen like that. Now obviously I don't know why this particular child already has a criminal record, perhaps he did just do something terrible, but I just wanted to perhaps open your mind a little to the idea that his criminal record is statistically very likely to be a direct result of the foster system dealing with in-house matters in court rather than at home, and failing that is statistically likely to be as a result of being let down by the adults in his life up to that point which has led to him acting out and/or being exploited by bad people who spotted someone vulnerable they could groom into crime. \n\nAll this to say, he's had a bad set of cards dealt to him which is why he's at the point he's at right now.

He can't get hired because of his criminal record, which thus limits his job capabilities and turns him toward whatever opportunities are available out of desperation, which then leads to further crime.\n\nIn my state, for example, there is a clear record of abuses in the justice system. A rich kid getting charged with this case would get community service, while a poor minority kid in the same circumstance might get 4 years served as an adult.

It's just how it works.\n\nAs Gandalf said: \"don't be so quick to deal out death and judgement, even the very wise cannot see all ends.\" Given that the state has opted not to press charges already, they don't feel the kid is a static risk to himself or others outside of this one-time event.

He still has a well functioning one, and I'm sure he's smart enough to know he can't steal his foster parents car, this kid has already been to prison once, and he still have no problem doing another stupid thing that will lead him to it once again, I think it will get worse if he wasn't punished at all and his foster parents just paid for him to get out of this.\n\nYou can't just keep saying his mind is not fully developed so he shouldn't be held accountable to his behavior as long as he's under 18 then suddenly have no problem with him going to jail for using drugs and stealing people's cars when his birthday pass, it's not like his brain suddenly becomes fully developed the moment he hit 18.", "Well it\u2019s definitely not my area of expertise, but I would wager the answer lives somewhere in the middle of providing proportional consequences, while still offering the resources to give a person a path to rehabilitation.
