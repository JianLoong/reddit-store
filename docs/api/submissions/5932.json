[Here's the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsf4iq/aita_for_not_inviting_them_to_my_christmas_party/) for reference. Since I got so many requests to check back in, here's the update:\n\n* I stuck to my guns and did not invite them to my Christmas party. My partner stood by me when I told him I had made my decision and didn't bring it up again, neither did our friends.\n* Many of you guessed that they would try and crash our party, I got worried  that could happen after all the responses but thankfully it didn't. Probably 100+ of you guessed she wanted to hijack the party to announce she was pregnant - if that's the case, they haven't told anyone as far as I know.\n* They did, however, decide to try and throw their own party at the same time  as ours. Several friends told us they were trying to convince them to  come to theirs instead. I honestly hope they had some guests and had a great time, I wish them no ill will, but I think just about everyone we expected came to our party so I doubt they poached any guests from us.\n* They made enough of a last minute fuss over this that the whole thing became the gossip of our party (their doing, not mine). I chose to not engage  in it but the consensus I heard was everyone thought it was bizarre they  chose not to invite us to their wedding and that them complaining about not being invited to our party was in poor taste.\n* Most common question on reddit was why did we not get an invite to their  wedding - from what I can tell from people at our party gossiping about the situation, they've said it was because we're a little bit older then they are? I think that's weird since my partner and I are both 35,  they're 28/29 so it's not like we're very far apart. Tara used to hang out with us at least once a week when she was single and I literally introduced them, the whole thing still seems strange to me but I guess  it is what it is?\n\nSo  yeah, that's how it all went down. Our party was a blast, we got to see so many friends some of which we haven't really seen since before COVID.  Everyone had a great time, people literally brought toddlers we hadn't  gotten to meet yet because of how crazy the world has been over the last  couple of years. It was a wonderful evening. I hope y'all had as good  of a Christmas as we did!", "created_utc": 1672330386, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zy935e/update_aita_for_not_inviting_them_to_my_christmas/", "score": 1159, "replies": ["Props to you for standing by* your initial decision. \n\nThey absolutely didn't deserve to be invited to your party, and I am very glad you ended up having a great time.", "It is hard when you start realizing that a friendship isn't reciprocal.

Obviously they know how to put on a grand production!", "If you look at the original post they linked it says they invited 200 guests", "Per the original, it was a 200 person wedding, and OP and partner knew \\~50.", "I believe OP said either in the original post or in comments that the excuse given to OP by the bride/groom was that it was just a small wedding so they couldn't invite everyone and thus OP and husband were excluded. But OP said the wedding was roughly 200 people and she knew about 50 people who attended, so OP didn't buy the excuse.", "200 people is huge.

Happy New Year!", "Hoo boy, if they think 35 is too old to be seen with 28 by other 20-somethings, they are not going to cope very well with the inevitable passage of time.", "The good part in all of this is that you realized that you were more invested in this friendship that they were\u2026 it\u2019s a good reflection on life and friendship\u2026 you might need to scale down your party even more in the future, but at least now you understand that sometimes a relationship just runs it\u2019s course and sometimes it\u2019s better to just let it go\u2026", "\u201cJust because you lost me as a friend, doesn\u2019t mean you gained me as an enemy.

You moved on and had a great time while they will sit at home pouting over this for years, probably.", "I love gossip, I just can't avoid it. This whole thing was just Wagyu grade for me. Thanks for the update!", "Thank you for the update,  I was wondering how things went and if they crashed the party. It really sucks when you think you are better friends than what you actually are and they treat you that way. Glad you had a great time!", " Shoo shop with them. No need to bring that into 2023. So glad you had a great party!", "YAY! Sounds like it all turned out for the best, honestly, and you can now leave this miserable couple in your rear-view mirror, where they belong!", "They didn't invite you because you're \"older\" at age 35? \ud83d\ude05 OMG the stupidity of that excuse!", "I'm glad that you stuck to your decision and had a great time!", "I'm just upset that I didn't receive an invite to your party.", "Great update OP! I\u2019m so glad your party worked out.", "Did they ever try to explain or give a good explanation as to why? Because if they just brushed it off and said \"Oh it was a small wedding\" then they're delusional if they thought everything was gonna be cool. With how close you guys are, it wasn't just something that slipped their minds. You were blatantly excluded on purpose.\n\nAnyways, glad to hear your party turned out well.

I had really tried to figure out why they didn\u2019t invite OP and her partner to the wedding. And then I saw a comment a little further up positing that OP throws a big party every year that everyone loves, and everyone loves her hosting, and essentially\u2026the bride probably didn\u2019t want to be upstaged. Bingo. Jealousy is wild!", "> They absolutely didn't deserve to be invited to your party\n\nAlso glad to read the friends/guests of OP agreed that the couple were acting in poor taste. If I were at the Christmas party, I would have tagged the absent couple in some fun party photos on Instagram to remind them of what they missed out on due to their boorish behavior.", "I'm picturing them standing in their empty house \"party\" looking at each other like _\"fuck, we really should have invited them to the wedding\"_", "Yeah, that's really weird. It can be the same age group depending on what people are doing in their lives...", "Lol. No one is stealing bridal attention at a wedding because they throw a good Christmas party.", "I definitely agree that it's not about age. I'm desperately curious if OP is prettier than the ex-friend, and that could be another reason why they weren't invited as a couple?", "Agreed, and he needs to do it very quickly.", "How so? The couple were perfectly within their rights to invite or not invite whoever they wanted to their wedding, but if you don\u2019t make room on a 200 person guest list for the people who threw the events that you and your spouse met at AND announced your engagement at, that\u2019s an asshole move. (Edit: apparently OP didn\u2019t just throw the event they met at, they literally introduced the couple to one another.) Desperately rude and oblivious at absolute best.\n\nBut then being upset about not being invited by the couple you snubbed, and trying to poach guests and organize a rival party on the same date? Undeniable assholes. OP handled it in a classy way and minimized conflict, but I think your social barometer is pretty off if you truly think there was no asshole behavior.", "> If I were at the Christmas party, I would have tagged the absent couple in some fun party photos on Instagram to remind them of what they missed out on due to their boorish behavior.\n\nIt was a good idea. Last year a similar incident happened to me with one of my neighbors. Then I could do it. Although now everything is fine between us.", "Why stupp to their level?  Let it go, as from what was said, OP didn't miss much.", "I\u2019m the party thrower of my friend group and one of my friends is going to be getting engaged in the near future and I just told my husband I hope she lets me help plan all the pre wedding stuff!", "to be fair, you only have to know 100, the other 100 is from your partner, but same, I can barely put together 20"]}
