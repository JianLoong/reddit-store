[Here's the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsf4iq/aita_for_not_inviting_them_to_my_christmas_party/) for reference. Since I got so many requests to check back in, here's the update:\n\n* I stuck to my guns and did not invite them to my Christmas party. My partner stood by me when I told him I had made my decision and didn't bring it up again, neither did our friends.\n* Many of you guessed that they would try and crash our party, I got worried  that could happen after all the responses but thankfully it didn't. Probably 100+ of you guessed she wanted to hijack the party to announce she was pregnant - if that's the case, they haven't told anyone as far as I know.\n* They did, however, decide to try and throw their own party at the same time  as ours. Several friends told us they were trying to convince them to  come to theirs instead. I honestly hope they had some guests and had a great time, I wish them no ill will, but I think just about everyone we expected came to our party so I doubt they poached any guests from us.\n* They made enough of a last minute fuss over this that the whole thing became the gossip of our party (their doing, not mine). I chose to not engage  in it but the consensus I heard was everyone thought it was bizarre they  chose not to invite us to their wedding and that them complaining about not being invited to our party was in poor taste.\n* Most common question on reddit was why did we not get an invite to their  wedding - from what I can tell from people at our party gossiping about the situation, they've said it was because we're a little bit older then they are? I think that's weird since my partner and I are both 35,  they're 28/29 so it's not like we're very far apart. Tara used to hang out with us at least once a week when she was single and I literally introduced them, the whole thing still seems strange to me but I guess  it is what it is?\n\nSo  yeah, that's how it all went down. Our party was a blast, we got to see so many friends some of which we haven't really seen since before COVID.  Everyone had a great time, people literally brought toddlers we hadn't  gotten to meet yet because of how crazy the world has been over the last  couple of years. It was a wonderful evening. I hope y'all had as good  of a Christmas as we did!", "created_utc": 1672330386, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zy935e/update_aita_for_not_inviting_them_to_my_christmas/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Props to you for standing by* your initial decision. \n\nThey absolutely didn't deserve to be invited to your party, and I am very glad you ended up having a great time.", "It is hard when you start realizing that a friendship isn't reciprocal. Glad you had a great time and that your party was a blast!", "Yeah it has nothing to do with your age\n\nYou and your spouse throw this big party.  \n\nPeople enjoy your hospitality and appreciate you. \n\nIf you came to their wedding, you would have taken attention away from the bride.  People would have talked about your parties, they would have socialized with you and at the end of the day, the bride and groom were not mature enough to deal with that", "Seems like whomever is keeping the gossip going needs to make an exit from your social circle.", "It was the right decision not inviting them. If they don\u2019t see you as a part of their life, then who are they to assume that they are a part of yours?", "Sounds like those \u201cfriends\u201d really torpedoed their standing with the rest of the group.", "NAH - No one was the asshole.", "[deleted]", "This could very well be the reason. \n\nBut some people are just users and not actually your friends.", "I would be asking my friend to help me throw my wedding then!! Obviously they know how to put on a grand production!", "If you look at the original post they linked it says they invited 200 guests", "Per the original, it was a 200 person wedding, and OP and partner knew \\~50.", "I believe OP said either in the original post or in comments that the excuse given to OP by the bride/groom was that it was just a small wedding so they couldn't invite everyone and thus OP and husband were excluded. But OP said the wedding was roughly 200 people and she knew about 50 people who attended, so OP didn't buy the excuse.", "200 people is huge. I don't even know 200 people, let alone know them well enough to invite to a wedding.", "Oh my gosh\u2026", "That\u2019s a whole lotta people wow\u2026", "Yes yes I see that now thank you"]}
