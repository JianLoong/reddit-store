[Here's the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsf4iq/aita_for_not_inviting_them_to_my_christmas_party/) for reference. Since I got so many requests to check back in, here's the update:\n\n* I stuck to my guns and did not invite them to my Christmas party. My partner stood by me when I told him I had made my decision and didn't bring it up again, neither did our friends.\n* Many of you guessed that they would try and crash our party, I got worried  that could happen after all the responses but thankfully it didn't. Probably 100+ of you guessed she wanted to hijack the party to announce she was pregnant - if that's the case, they haven't told anyone as far as I know.\n* They did, however, decide to try and throw their own party at the same time  as ours. Several friends told us they were trying to convince them to  come to theirs instead. I honestly hope they had some guests and had a great time, I wish them no ill will, but I think just about everyone we expected came to our party so I doubt they poached any guests from us.\n* They made enough of a last minute fuss over this that the whole thing became the gossip of our party (their doing, not mine). I chose to not engage  in it but the consensus I heard was everyone thought it was bizarre they  chose not to invite us to their wedding and that them complaining about not being invited to our party was in poor taste.\n* Most common question on reddit was why did we not get an invite to their  wedding - from what I can tell from people at our party gossiping about the situation, they've said it was because we're a little bit older then they are? I think that's weird since my partner and I are both 35,  they're 28/29 so it's not like we're very far apart. Tara used to hang out with us at least once a week when she was single and I literally introduced them, the whole thing still seems strange to me but I guess  it is what it is?\n\nSo  yeah, that's how it all went down. Our party was a blast, we got to see so many friends some of which we haven't really seen since before COVID.  Everyone had a great time, people literally brought toddlers we hadn't  gotten to meet yet because of how crazy the world has been over the last  couple of years. It was a wonderful evening. I hope y'all had as good  of a Christmas as we did!", "created_utc": 1672330386, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zy935e/update_aita_for_not_inviting_them_to_my_christmas/", "score": 2944, "replies": ["Props to you for standing by* your initial decision. \n\nThey absolutely didn't deserve to be invited to your party, and I am very glad you ended up having a great time.", "It is hard when you start realizing that a friendship isn't reciprocal.

Thanks for the update!", "Thank you for the update,  I was wondering how things went and if they crashed the party. It really sucks when you think you are better friends than what you actually are and they treat you that way. Glad you had a great time!", " Shoo shop with them. No need to bring that into 2023. So glad you had a great party!", "YAY! Sounds like it all turned out for the best, honestly, and you can now leave this miserable couple in your rear-view mirror, where they belong!", "They didn't invite you because you're \"older\" at age 35? \ud83d\ude05 OMG the stupidity of that excuse!", "I'm glad that you stuck to your decision and had a great time!", "I'm just upset that I didn't receive an invite to your party.", "Great update OP! I\u2019m so glad your party worked out.", "Did they ever try to explain or give a good explanation as to why? Because if they just brushed it off and said \"Oh it was a small wedding\" then they're delusional if they thought everything was gonna be cool. With how close you guys are, it wasn't just something that slipped their minds. You were blatantly excluded on purpose.\n\nAnyways, glad to hear your party turned out well.

And then I saw a comment a little further up positing that OP throws a big party every year that everyone loves, and everyone loves her hosting, and essentially\u2026the bride probably didn\u2019t want to be upstaged. Bingo. Jealousy is wild!", "> They absolutely didn't deserve to be invited to your party\n\nAlso glad to read the friends/guests of OP agreed that the couple were acting in poor taste.

It can be the same age group depending on what people are doing in their lives...", "Lol. No one is stealing bridal attention at a wedding because they throw a good Christmas party.", "I definitely agree that it's not about age. I'm desperately curious if OP is prettier than the ex-friend, and that could be another reason why they weren't invited as a couple?", "Agreed, and he needs to do it very quickly.", "How so? The couple were perfectly within their rights to invite or not invite whoever they wanted to their wedding, but if you don\u2019t make room on a 200 person guest list for the people who threw the events that you and your spouse met at AND announced your engagement at, that\u2019s an asshole move. (Edit: apparently OP didn\u2019t just throw the event they met at, they literally introduced the couple to one another.) Desperately rude and oblivious at absolute best.\n\nBut then being upset about not being invited by the couple you snubbed, and trying to poach guests and organize a rival party on the same date? Undeniable assholes. OP handled it in a classy way and minimized conflict, but I think your social barometer is pretty off if you truly think there was no asshole behavior.", "> If I were at the Christmas party, I would have tagged the absent couple in some fun party photos on Instagram to remind them of what they missed out on due to their boorish behavior.\n\nIt was a good idea. Last year a similar incident happened to me with one of my neighbors. Then I could do it. Although now everything is fine between us.", "Why stupp to their level?  Let it go, as from what was said, OP didn't miss much.", "I\u2019m the party thrower of my friend group and one of my friends is going to be getting engaged in the near future and I just told my husband I hope she lets me help plan all the pre wedding stuff!", "to be fair, you only have to know 100, the other 100 is from your partner, but same, I can barely put together 20", "This outcome makes me so happy. You had your party with your friends and had a wonderful time despite it all - the best revenge is life well lived!", "They didn't invite you because you're \"older\" at age 35? Oh my I have to laugh", "I helped a \"friend\" and his fiance move once. Didn't get an invite to the wedding. That slight will never be forgiven", "I love a happy ending. NTA.", "Glad you stuck to your guns Op and had a wonderful party. Make room for future friends in the future and get rid of those who don't value you.", "I'm glad that you're not suffering too much ill will or harassment from mutuals or anything over this. Their behaviour is really bizarre and to not invite you to their wedding then make a fuss over not being invited to your party IS in poor taste.", "WOW did they really think they deserved an invite after all that? Like did they really think that would fly? They seriously torpedoed their own public image.", "35 is too old!? Disgusting. Glad I said NTA the first time! Good for you for sticking to your guns. They don\u2019t deserve you as a friend.", "Obviously NTA, but know that if you do ever try to repair the relationship with your friends, you are going to be to blame for all the gossip at your party. It doesn't matter if you were or not, they will always see you that way. That's the way these types of people usually work.", "Awesome update!! Happy Holidays a", "Good to the both of you for sticking to your guns and not inviting Tara and her gremlin. And as for the pre-emptive measures, good job on making sure that they didn't happen. I'm so glad you guys had an awesome time and have a wonderful New Years!", "oh its a smaller wedding nbd it's a smaller party nbd right?", "Good to heard that y\u2019all had a great party- I\u2019m glad you and your partner were able to enjoy yourselves and not have to deal with any drama. Have a happy New Year! \n\nPS I\u2019m grateful for the update. Your original post was so riveting- I really didn\u2019t want them to crash your party. Good riddance.", "I think the so-called friend is/was jealous. Jealousy is not a rare thing and many people can only handle having the object of their jealousy around so much. In her wedding she didn\u2019t want to have someone who is 6-7 years ahead of her, age and life experiences-wise, and popular/happy. SHE will be the popular/happy  35-years-old in 6 years and \u201cmust work on her brand\u201d starting now. She wanted to attend the Christmas party mainly to criticize and steal ideas.", "Tbh I was thinking about your original post today. What a coincidence that you posted an update. So glad that you enjoyed your party. Happy holidays!", "Good for you, OP.  \nAnd I didn't see the original post, so I just wanted to chime in how odd it is they didn't invite you.  \nI've never heard of the person who introduced the couple being excluded. That's ridiculous. I would have been really insulted.", "Glad you didn\u2019t invite them. They showed you very clearly what level of friendship they consider y\u2019all have.", "Props to you for not only standing by your decision (as noted by others) but also for not badmouthing/gossiping about this with your other friends.  You stayed above the fray and handled this with class and your true friends noticed.  Happy New Year!", "INFO: are you of color or LGBTQ? Just wondering because this sort of snub happens in my circles frequently at big events where appearances matter\u2026", "These so-called friends learned a hard lesson. By excluding you from their one-time wedding, they have now lost a yearly invite to the Party of the Year!  Every. Year. A hard lesson indeed.", "Proud of ya sticking to your guns. You don't need those negative people in your life. The age difference is a joke. 35 from 28 is basically same age. It doesn't matter age of friends. If you are good friend it wouldn't matter if you are 20 or 40. Actions speak louder than words", "You could say that they were too young for your christmas party", "You don\u2019t need to feel guilty about not including people who choose to exclude you.  They\u2019ve shown you that they don\u2019t consider you to be a close friend by excluding you from their wedding.  That was extremely rude.  Spend your time with friends who treat you with respect.", "Glad for you that your party went well...you know, sometimes people make strange choices...I stopped trying to understand why.. you can not change people\u00b4s mind.\n\nWe have a saying Who stops saying hallo to you, less problems you will have with (sorry English is not my first, second or even 3rd language haha)\n\nFrom your posts I see that you are really NTA... for what\u00b4s it worth!", "Love happy endings, lose their number, those buttholes doesnt deserve your friendship.", "Hey,  I can tell you why I lose friends,  why I'm not invited places,  why everything.  The friend had a crush on you at one point.  There is some jealousy somewhere with something. I'm constantly getting in trouble because I smiled/ talked to/ looked at a person.  Nta", "What an odd excuse for not inviting you to the wedding. You weren't too old when they were hanging out or accepting party invites. If they were trying to hold a party to spoil yours then you now know that this is a really not the type of person you want as a friend. Glad your party went well.", "Don\u2019t see why age would come into it.  Did neither the bride nor groom have parents at their wedding?  Have weddings now become such a carefully staged celebrations that the guest list has little to do with friends and relatives?", ">I think that's weird since my partner and I are both 35, they're 28/29 so it's not like we're very far apart. \n\nEvery wedding I've ever been to has had an age range of around 7 years old to somewhere in the mid 80's, it's a wedding ffs, this reasoning makes no sense to me.", "i would start having a party on their anniversary every year just cuz and for no real obvious reason than to be petty", "Better ending, they cut themselves out of your friend group", "I remember reading a lot of comments worrying that they would try crashing the party instead, I suppose throwing their own is a better (if still very petty) alternative to that?", "Cue up Maury and his life detector tests!", "It never occured to me that friendships had strict age limits once you are adults.\n\nRecently I went to the baby shower of a friend who is almost 20 years younger than me...", "They'll clutch their pearls when they learn my fiance is 10 years older than me, 34 & 44.", "Not sure I ever heard that quote before. I like it. <3", "Haha your drama llama has been fed very well!", "THIS.", "Exactly! Did they not invite their parents or grandparents either??? Was it a 30 and under wedding? Lol.", "Ohhhh now this makes me wonder if there was ever another update to that awful one about the woman whose husband was in love with her sister for years and years.", "You just answered your own question. Simple and sublime.", "Actually, given some thought I think it is.  It saved OP from a confrontation that would cast a pall on her holiday party, and totally exposed the tacky couple for who and what they are.  Anyone who gave them the benefit of the doubt can't do so anymore. In their haste to make OP look bad, they shined an unforgiving spotlight on themselves.", "Throwing your *own* party with *blackjack and hookers* is definitely the 'passive-aggressive diet version' of crashing the party.", "It absolutely never for a single second would have occurred to me that anyone could possibly upstage me or my husband on our wedding day. I mean, I was the bride!", " I hope she lets me help plan all the pre wedding stuff!", "Same!  My friends and I have a monthly dinner tradition.  The same group is invited but depending on the month and their plans, our dinner can be small or large and at times, friends bring other friends.  I want to say at one point the youngest attendee just turned 21 and the oldest was 55.  Average age is late 30s.\n\nSince there are no seating arrangements, everyone ends up mingling and interacting with new people each month.  It\u2019s quite fun because we all end up having a different experience and everyone leaves friendly and happy.", "I don\u2019t think they\u2019re that self aware. They were probably blaming OP for that too", "It's so tempting to want to try to figure out the reason. Even for us, Redditors with only a few paragraphs to go off of, we can't stand not knowing.\n\nAnother potential reason I thought of is that maybe the couple gets irked by being reminded of how they met, if there was something awkward about it? Like if one of them was actually in a relationship with someone else at the time? Maybe one of them was cheating when they first got together so they lied to family/friends about where/when they first met? Or maybe they broke up at one point and got back together later and only want to focus on the \"new\" relationship and forget the first one happened? Maybe OP has a tendency to make a big deal about how she's the one who introduced them and is kind of intrusive about it, or wants more credit than they feel she deserves for making their relationship happen? Maybe there's some past romantic/sexual history or even just an unrequited crush between one of them and OP or her partner, and the couple felt like it would be awkward for them to be at the wedding?\n\nThere are lots of potential reasons, but not really any good ones that make a lot of sense.", "Exactly, they are not your real friends.", "That's exactly my point!", "Yeah that idea is crazy. Plus it's crazy to be worried people may spend any of the 4+ hour reception not talking about the bride and groom. I would really hope that wasn't the reason, but there's seemingly no sensible reason.", "Shhh. We\u2019re in make believe land where people cosplay as detectives and therapists.", "I have pictured OP as a gay man from the use of the term \"partner\" throughout the posts. But just looked back and nowhere did he/she indicate his/her gender but partner is a man. So now I'm curious.", "Do you have a link to that one?", "Some people would try anyway which is why weddings need security, lol.", "I definitely agree that it's not about age.", "It's *stoop but yeah tagging them in photos? That's so tacky wtf", "Exactly. That'd just make it worse, not better. OP even wished them well in their own event.", "this looks so fun omg i wanna try this with my friends", "Either way the reason is petty and the relationship is destroyed due to lack of communication on the other couples part.", "Thing is, all these reasons you listed don't make sense, because then why would they still make such a big deal about wanting to come to the christmas party?", "OP listed her gender in the headline on another sub in regards to this topic. She listed 35f and 35m for herself and her partner.", "I got the same impression.  If true then that makes me believe the exclusion was more discriminatory.\n\nToo many excuses.  I really hope this isn\u2019t the case though.", "Oh yeah Definitely need a link. \ud83d\udc40", "people on here are obsessed with petty oneupsmanship even if its a truly dumb idea", "I read that as the yiddish word but I admit I don't know how it's spelled.", "Shtup is a VERY different word... \ud83d\ude33", "Stoop = bend, lower.\n\nShtup = fuck. \n\nYou sure about that?", "I don't think you actually understand what the word you tried to use actually means."]}
