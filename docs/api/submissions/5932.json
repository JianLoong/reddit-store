[Here's the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsf4iq/aita_for_not_inviting_them_to_my_christmas_party/) for reference. Since I got so many requests to check back in, here's the update:\n\n* I stuck to my guns and did not invite them to my Christmas party. My partner stood by me when I told him I had made my decision and didn't bring it up again, neither did our friends.\n* Many of you guessed that they would try and crash our party, I got worried  that could happen after all the responses but thankfully it didn't. Probably 100+ of you guessed she wanted to hijack the party to announce she was pregnant - if that's the case, they haven't told anyone as far as I know.\n* They did, however, decide to try and throw their own party at the same time  as ours. Several friends told us they were trying to convince them to  come to theirs instead. I honestly hope they had some guests and had a great time, I wish them no ill will, but I think just about everyone we expected came to our party so I doubt they poached any guests from us.\n* They made enough of a last minute fuss over this that the whole thing became the gossip of our party (their doing, not mine). I chose to not engage  in it but the consensus I heard was everyone thought it was bizarre they  chose not to invite us to their wedding and that them complaining about not being invited to our party was in poor taste.\n* Most common question on reddit was why did we not get an invite to their  wedding - from what I can tell from people at our party gossiping about the situation, they've said it was because we're a little bit older then they are? I think that's weird since my partner and I are both 35,  they're 28/29 so it's not like we're very far apart. Tara used to hang out with us at least once a week when she was single and I literally introduced them, the whole thing still seems strange to me but I guess  it is what it is?\n\nSo  yeah, that's how it all went down. Our party was a blast, we got to see so many friends some of which we haven't really seen since before COVID.  Everyone had a great time, people literally brought toddlers we hadn't  gotten to meet yet because of how crazy the world has been over the last  couple of years. It was a wonderful evening. I hope y'all had as good  of a Christmas as we did!", "created_utc": 1672330386, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zy935e/update_aita_for_not_inviting_them_to_my_christmas/", "score": 12648, "replies": ["Props to you for standing by* your initial decision. \n\nThey absolutely didn't deserve to be invited to your party, and I am very glad you ended up having a great time.", "It is hard when you start realizing that a friendship isn't reciprocal.

No one is stealing bridal attention at a wedding because they throw a good Christmas party.", "I definitely agree that it's not about age.

The couple were perfectly within their rights to invite or not invite whoever they wanted to their wedding, but if you don\u2019t make room on a 200 person guest list for the people who threw the events that you and your spouse met at AND announced your engagement at, that\u2019s an asshole move. (Edit: apparently OP didn\u2019t just throw the event they met at, they literally introduced the couple to one another.) Desperately rude and oblivious at absolute best.\n\nBut then being upset about not being invited by the couple you snubbed, and trying to poach guests and organize a rival party on the same date? Undeniable assholes. OP handled it in a classy way and minimized conflict, but I think your social barometer is pretty off if you truly think there was no asshole behavior.", "> If I were at the Christmas party, I would have tagged the absent couple in some fun party photos on Instagram to remind them of what they missed out on due to their boorish behavior.\n\nIt was a good idea.

Their behaviour is really bizarre and to not invite you to their wedding then make a fuss over not being invited to your party IS in poor taste.", "WOW did they really think they deserved an invite after all that? Like did they really think that would fly? They seriously torpedoed their own public image.", "35 is too old!? Disgusting. Glad I said NTA the first time! Good for you for sticking to your guns. They don\u2019t deserve you as a friend.", "Obviously NTA, but know that if you do ever try to repair the relationship with your friends, you are going to be to blame for all the gossip at your party.

She wanted to attend the Christmas party mainly to criticize and steal ideas.", "Tbh I was thinking about your original post today. What a coincidence that you posted an update. So glad that you enjoyed your party. Happy holidays!", "Good for you, OP.  \nAnd I didn't see the original post, so I just wanted to chime in how odd it is they didn't invite you.  \nI've never heard of the person who introduced the couple being excluded. That's ridiculous. I would have been really insulted.", "Glad you didn\u2019t invite them. They showed you very clearly what level of friendship they consider y\u2019all have.", "Props to you for not only standing by your decision (as noted by others) but also for not badmouthing/gossiping about this with your other friends.  You stayed above the fray and handled this with class and your true friends noticed.  Happy New Year!", "INFO: are you of color or LGBTQ? Just wondering because this sort of snub happens in my circles frequently at big events where appearances matter\u2026", "These so-called friends learned a hard lesson. By excluding you from their one-time wedding, they have now lost a yearly invite to the Party of the Year!  Every. Year. A hard lesson indeed.", "Proud of ya sticking to your guns. You don't need those negative people in your life. The age difference is a joke. 35 from 28 is basically same age. It doesn't matter age of friends.

The friend had a crush on you at one point.  There is some jealousy somewhere with something. I'm constantly getting in trouble because I smiled/ talked to/ looked at a person.  Nta", "What an odd excuse for not inviting you to the wedding. You weren't too old when they were hanging out or accepting party invites. If they were trying to hold a party to spoil yours then you now know that this is a really not the type of person you want as a friend. Glad your party went well.", "Don\u2019t see why age would come into it.  Did neither the bride nor groom have parents at their wedding?  Have weddings now become such a carefully staged celebrations that the guest list has little to do with friends and relatives?", ">I think that's weird since my partner and I are both 35, they're 28/29 so it's not like we're very far apart. \n\nEvery wedding I've ever been to has had an age range of around 7 years old to somewhere in the mid 80's, it's a wedding ffs, this reasoning makes no sense to me.", "i would start having a party on their anniversary every year just cuz and for no real obvious reason than to be petty", "Better ending, they cut themselves out of your friend group", "I remember reading a lot of comments worrying that they would try crashing the party instead, I suppose throwing their own is a better (if still very petty) alternative to that?", "Cue up Maury and his life detector tests!", "It never occured to me that friendships had strict age limits once you are adults.\n\nRecently I went to the baby shower of a friend who is almost 20 years younger than me...", "They'll clutch their pearls when they learn my fiance is 10 years older than me, 34 & 44.", "Not sure I ever heard that quote before. I like it. <3", "Haha your drama llama has been fed very well!", "THIS.", "Exactly! Did they not invite their parents or grandparents either??? Was it a 30 and under wedding? Lol.", "Ohhhh now this makes me wonder if there was ever another update to that awful one about the woman whose husband was in love with her sister for years and years.", "You just answered your own question. Simple and sublime.", "Actually, given some thought I think it is.  It saved OP from a confrontation that would cast a pall on her holiday party, and totally exposed the tacky couple for who and what they are.  Anyone who gave them the benefit of the doubt can't do so anymore. In their haste to make OP look bad, they shined an unforgiving spotlight on themselves.", "Throwing your *own* party with *blackjack and hookers* is definitely the 'passive-aggressive diet version' of crashing the party.", "It absolutely never for a single second would have occurred to me that anyone could possibly upstage me or my husband on our wedding day. I mean, I was the bride!", " I hope she lets me help plan all the pre wedding stuff!", "Same!  My friends and I have a monthly dinner tradition.  The same group is invited but depending on the month and their plans, our dinner can be small or large and at times, friends bring other friends.  I want to say at one point the youngest attendee just turned 21 and the oldest was 55.  Average age is late 30s.\n\nSince there are no seating arrangements, everyone ends up mingling and interacting with new people each month.  It\u2019s quite fun because we all end up having a different experience and everyone leaves friendly and happy.", "I don\u2019t think they\u2019re that self aware. They were probably blaming OP for that too", "It's so tempting to want to try to figure out the reason. Even for us, Redditors with only a few paragraphs to go off of, we can't stand not knowing.\n\nAnother potential reason I thought of is that maybe the couple gets irked by being reminded of how they met, if there was something awkward about it? Like if one of them was actually in a relationship with someone else at the time? Maybe one of them was cheating when they first got together so they lied to family/friends about where/when they first met? Or maybe they broke up at one point and got back together later and only want to focus on the \"new\" relationship and forget the first one happened? Maybe OP has a tendency to make a big deal about how she's the one who introduced them and is kind of intrusive about it, or wants more credit than they feel she deserves for making their relationship happen? Maybe there's some past romantic/sexual history or even just an unrequited crush between one of them and OP or her partner, and the couple felt like it would be awkward for them to be at the wedding?\n\nThere are lots of potential reasons, but not really any good ones that make a lot of sense.", "Exactly, they are not your real friends.", "That's exactly my point!", "Yeah that idea is crazy. Plus it's crazy to be worried people may spend any of the 4+ hour reception not talking about the bride and groom. I would really hope that wasn't the reason, but there's seemingly no sensible reason.", "Shhh. We\u2019re in make believe land where people cosplay as detectives and therapists.", "I have pictured OP as a gay man from the use of the term \"partner\" throughout the posts. But just looked back and nowhere did he/she indicate his/her gender but partner is a man. So now I'm curious.", "Do you have a link to that one?", "Some people would try anyway which is why weddings need security, lol.", "[removed]", "It's *stoop but yeah tagging them in photos? That's so tacky wtf", "Exactly. That'd just make it worse, not better. OP even wished them well in their own event.", "this looks so fun omg i wanna try this with my friends", "Either way the reason is petty and the relationship is destroyed due to lack of communication on the other couples part.", "Thing is, all these reasons you listed don't make sense, because then why would they still make such a big deal about wanting to come to the christmas party?", "OP listed her gender in the headline on another sub in regards to this topic. She listed 35f and 35m for herself and her partner.", "I got the same impression.  If true then that makes me believe the exclusion was more discriminatory.\n\nToo many excuses.  I really hope this isn\u2019t the case though.", "Oh yeah Definitely need a link. \ud83d\udc40", "people on here are obsessed with petty oneupsmanship even if its a truly dumb idea", "I read that as the yiddish word but I admit I don't know how it's spelled.", "Shtup is a VERY different word... \ud83d\ude33", "Stoop = bend, lower.\n\nShtup = fuck. \n\nYou sure about that?", "I don't think you actually understand what the word you tried to use actually means.", "Glad your party was a success OP! And I also hope the \u201cfriends\u201d who keeping telling you how the other couple\u2019s feelings are not just trying to start some drama. Beware the unrelated people who like to bring up nonsense when you don\u2019t even ask about it!", "What\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander.  Good on you for sticking to your guns.", "This sounds like that post a few weeks back where the bride didn't want anybody different in the wedding photos ..... OP, are you or your partner different race to this couple? Or is your lady way hoer than this girl and would outshine her?\n\nNta", "..of course they tried to throw a competing party. I don\u2019t get why some people are the way they are. Sounds like you handled it with grace however I\u2019m still absolutely floored! Good for you sticking to your guns!", "With the large amount of people they invited it\u2019s possible they just forgot to invite you and then made up some dumb lies because they forgot. Either way, thanks for the update and your party seems like a fun event! Send us pictures!", "So glad to hear that you had a great time despite the drama leading up to your party. Sounds like you did the right thing and handled it appropriately. Hopefully the other couple has learned a lesson about entitlement. But it doesn\u2019t sound like it. It\u2019s not surprising they tried to hijack your party guests and Throw their own party. Lol that\u2019s the pettiness and pride coming out for the need for revenge. More entitlement. But look at the bright side. They will realize they failed because all the guests they tried to invite showed up at your party anyway and they know that since they were not at their party. They still will feel that even if they did have other guests show up that you don\u2019t know or didn\u2019t invite to yours. \n\nPerhaps this can all be put behind you now and hopefully they will let it go and you can just part ways amicably from here on out.", "Nice job! You\u2019re awesome. They\u2019re idiots. Bye Felicia!", "It\u2019s too bad they didn\u2019t just come out and apologize for not inviting you.

I always saw weddings as multi-generational affairs so the age excuse is downright bizarre even if there was a significant age difference.", "Living well is the best revenge, even when the situation doesn't really call for \"revenge\". Happy New Year!", "Wow what a journey this story was. There is a world where I could imagine them not making a fuss over this, continuing to be friendly with you when your paths inevitably crossed and maybe even continuing the friendship in spite of the wedding snub. Maybe reach out to you and smooth things over\u2026\n\nBut to be sore over not getting invited to the Christmas party and complaining to others about it, then trying to ruin the party by throwing a competing one, like damn! What is their problem??", "I'm so glad it went off so well and that your friends who attended are in agreement they were acting like spoiled children. I wish you all the best New Year!", "I hope you guys realized those aren't your friends anymore lol", "If that's truly the reason you weren't invited, it's ridiculous. I go to parties with people 25-65, and everyone has a blast together.", ">Tara used to hang out with us at least once a week when she was single and I literally introduced them, the whole thing still seems strange to me but I guess it is what it is?\n\nOK, hold on now.  I don't know if you mentioned in your original post that you introduced them, but that makes them extra-super AHs for not inviting you to their wedding.  I'm legitimately flabbergasted.  And I don't believe for a second that there was no one over 35 at the wedding. \n\nThis all seems like this couple just likes to produce drama, so probably not bad that they're (maybe?) out of your life.", "I'm cackling over the age thing.

One year, when we went to hire the DJ as usual, he had already been hired. By a friend of ours. For his Halloween party. On the same day. He also reached out to all our mutual friends and told them to come to his party before we'd had a chance to remind them we were doing our party again as usual. We found that most of our guests were diverted to his party. So we just didn't hold ours. We never had a Halloween party again. \n\nSome people will enjoy your hospitality for years, but somehow still be quietly seething that they're not getting the credit for throwing the best party themselves.", "Seems that you're trying to turn a snub into a feud. Sound exhausting to me, but if that's what you want, happy feuding.", "So you're close enough in age they're dying to party with you at your events, but youre too old to party with them at their events. Ok Tara, eat shit. Love the update!", "YTA. They don\u2019t have to invite everyone to a wedding.", "I'm guessing that is something the rumor mill started and not the actual reason. It sounds like OP is running off of rumors and hasn't actually talked to the couple themselves.

My girlfriend's grandmother is in her 90s.  She is healthy as an ox, active in her community, and recently had a 70 year-old tell her, \"When you reach my age, you'll understand how hard old age is, my dear.\"  When she explained that she was in her 90s, the 70 year-old just stood there in utter disbelief.\n\nBut the point is this: she won the \"don't die young\" contest.  She outlived all the people her own age.  In order for her to have *any* friends at all, she had to get into the local events and make friends.  She knows people of all ages in a book club, at a local charity, and a few other places.  She goes to lunch with a woman in her 50s.  She *had* to expand her idea of what age was \"appropriate\" to hang out with.\n\nAnd I'm starting to see that now, just recently, as I'm getting older.  I see younger people who are weirded out that I would invite them to a D&D game night, for example.

Grab another bottle and even the color out, perfect excuse to have a red wedding dress :)", "Perhaps you could speak to them about it instead of causing a rift in your friendship group?

What is the guest list thing in weddings.\n I have very little idea. In my country, i have attended weddings of people who i don't even know. In our country, we invite friends' brothers' friends' brother. We invite our whole town and town next to that. We invite people from random place we met once. We invite our video game play buddies and we invite random coworkers too. \nWhy is the invitation limited??", "/u/Careless_Ad3968 and /u/forthewatch39 - what good discerning eyes you two fellow Redditors have!!!

It's nice to see that they stuck with you instead of going over to the \"dark side\". It's so petty what that other couple are doing, really sad...

And we didn't take issue with not being on their wedding lists. The rest of our lives continued unchanged, nobody's friendship was over for it because we're all adults who understand that weddings are a different monster.
