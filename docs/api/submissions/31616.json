{"id": 31616, "submission_id": "182ost5", "title": "AITA for ruining my boyfriend\u2019s Thanksgiving with his family?", "selftext": "My (25F) boyfriend (26M) and I have been together for three years and holidays have always been a huge deal for both of our families. Our first year together, I felt extremely guilted by both him and his family to spend both holidays (Thanksgiving and Christmas) with them. At the time, my family and I were having some turmoil, so I did not attend any of my own family events and attended his instead. This really hurt my family and I have promised myself I would at least split the holidays. It is a 30 minutes drive between both family\u2019s homes, so very manageable. \n\nThe next year, due to another issue (me not converting religions), his parents chose not to invite me to any of the holiday events. The plan was for me to spend the entire thanksgiving and Christmas with my family, he would drive over to stop in for a couple hours so he would be splitting the time. For both thanksgiving and Christmas the second year, he showed up 3 hours late, missed food and other activities that we had waited on him for, and arrived just as everyone was leaving. This disappointed me beyond belief.\n\nFor some background, a year into our relationship, my boyfriend\u2019s parents kicked him out and disowned him. He had no where to go, lost his job, lost his dog due to not being able to find proper housing, etc. I took him in and left him live with me, my father gave him a job, my parents put his bills under their name and signed on as guarantors on his new apartment, helped him sell his truck for a car, and got him into a very nice college.\n\nThis year, he confirmed to my parents verbally that he would be in attendance ON TIME two weeks prior. On Tuesday, my mother called to confirm one more time and he said he would definitely be there. About an hour later, he tells me his mother is going through a very hard time right now with empty nest syndrome since her two youngest started college this past fall 15 minutes away from their home, she sees them 2-3 times a week. She requested that my boyfriend stayed the entire week. This meant he would not be attending my family\u2019s thanksgiving AT ALL and he expected ME to tell my family. I told him to do what he needed to do and that I understood. He was not happy with this answer and demanded to know my opinion on it. I told him I felt absolutely disrespected and that I felt devastated for my parents. He blew up on me and said I should be sympathetic. So as a result, I told him that if that was his choice, he would be spending all of Christmas with my family and I. He is telling me I am a huge a-hole and that his mother would never allow it, but how is what I\u2019m asking different from what his family expects of him? Are we not family?

They kicked him out,  they never offered to pay for college,  and doesn't seem like they ever bothered to apologize either.  That family appears to be a disaster that will continue to use him until he grows a spine. \n\nNTA here", "His parents are deeply Christian and I am an atheist. This was not a problem for them until after multiple times of accompanying them to their church out of respect, I told them I could not see myself converting in the near future. They have not spoken a word to me since.", "Both Thanksgiving and Christmas last year, he stayed with his family 2-3 days prior, on the day of the holidays, he was supposed to show up at 4:30 pm, he showed up 8 o\u2019clock both times. The reason always changed. Either his mother didn\u2019t start cooking early enough, he lost track of time, his mother wanted help around the house, his mother started crying over him leaving so early, making him stay. Honestly, I gave up because I could never get a straight answer", "Genuinely asking for your opinion here. Because of the previous mishaps with planning holidays the past two years, we did discuss this years plans heavily. He was meant to tell his family he was going to stop by for a few hours on Thanksgiving day and confirmed this with me numerous times over the course of November. My issue is that if he had actually told his family, I\u2019m 110% sure they would see zero issue and even expect it, his parents and I do not speak, but are on cordial terms. I am starting to get the impression that he never even told his family the plan and ran out of time to let them know. Almost like the grace period before they got angry passed and he chose to hide it until the last minute, this is a running trend in our relationship. How do I get around this or what am I supposed to do differently avoid this? I thought a month was more than enough time to let them know, but maybe I went about it incorrectly.", "Family is a funny thing! No matter how toxic a family can be some people simply can\u2019t let go! \nYour bf will always choose his family over yours and maybe even you. \nLook at the facts\u2026you family accepted him without hesitation, helped him get back on his feet and help plan out his future. Then his family decided to grace them with their forgiveness and immediately your family and all they did is forgotten!!\nI\u2019m not going to say drop him, but I will say think long and hard before hitching your wagon to this guy because I have a feeling he will continue to let you down!

Are they trumpers too?", "Because he is lying and you are no priority.\n\ndump him", "he\u2019s cheating on you lol you forgave him and now he doesn\u2019t care. grow a spine and get out", "Why his mom care too much when before they have kick him out of the house.", "That's a different thing. If he can't be honest with his parents and strings you and your family along until the last minute, he's being very disrespectful and I fully understand you being mad.\n\nMy initial suggestion was going to be that you:\n\n* do holidays separately for the time being (I was going to say this before realizing you were already living together)\n* you both go to both and spend a bit of time with each family\n* go together to one family for thanksgiving and then to the other family for Christmas (this is what we do with Xmas eve's dinner/Xmas' day lunch as we don't have thanksgiving)\n\nBut for the last two to work you'd need to be able to attend the holidays at his parents, which I understood, from the original post, wasn't a possibility.\n\nIf you're not welcome at your in-laws your deal of you spending it with your parents is perfectly fine. And he could do 50-50 on both holidays or spend one with you and one with his family or both with you or both with his family. All of these options are fine.\n\nI don't think the issue is with the option you guys chose or with how much time he had to talk to his parents. From your response it actually sounds like it's a matter of him not having the guts to make a decision and stick by it. I don't think you get to be upset if he chooses to be at his parents or even if he was planning to be with you and changed his mind for his mother's sake and asks you to tell your parents. But he should be man enough to be honest about what he wants to do and stick to it.\n\nIn my initial response I actually didn't realize thanksgiving was yesterday (not american xD) so I didn't understood he completely bailed at the last second.
