Our first year together, I felt extremely guilted by both him and his family to spend both holidays (Thanksgiving and Christmas) with them. At the time, my family and I were having some turmoil, so I did not attend any of my own family events and attended his instead. This really hurt my family and I have promised myself I would at least split the holidays. It is a 30 minutes drive between both family\u2019s homes, so very manageable. \n\nThe next year, due to another issue (me not converting religions), his parents chose not to invite me to any of the holiday events. The plan was for me to spend the entire thanksgiving and Christmas with my family, he would drive over to stop in for a couple hours so he would be splitting the time. For both thanksgiving and Christmas the second year, he showed up 3 hours late, missed food and other activities that we had waited on him for, and arrived just as everyone was leaving. This disappointed me beyond belief.\n\nFor some background, a year into our relationship, my boyfriend\u2019s parents kicked him out and disowned him. He had no where to go, lost his job, lost his dog due to not being able to find proper housing, etc. I took him in and left him live with me, my father gave him a job, my parents put his bills under their name and signed on as guarantors on his new apartment, helped him sell his truck for a car, and got him into a very nice college.\n\nThis year, he confirmed to my parents verbally that he would be in attendance ON TIME two weeks prior. On Tuesday, my mother called to confirm one more time and he said he would definitely be there. About an hour later, he tells me his mother is going through a very hard time right now with empty nest syndrome since her two youngest started college this past fall 15 minutes away from their home, she sees them 2-3 times a week. She requested that my boyfriend stayed the entire week. This meant he would not be attending my family\u2019s thanksgiving AT ALL and he expected ME to tell my family. I told him to do what he needed to do and that I understood. He was not happy with this answer and demanded to know my opinion on it. I told him I felt absolutely disrespected and that I felt devastated for my parents. He blew up on me and said I should be sympathetic. So as a result, I told him that if that was his choice, he would be spending all of Christmas with my family and I. He is telling me I am a huge a-hole and that his mother would never allow it, but how is what I\u2019m asking different from what his family expects of him? Are we not family? Please tell me, AITA?\n\nEDIT: I want to address a few of the comments and questions. There are a lot of people saying I am spineless for staying with him after the infidelities. I have lots of trauma when it comes to mentally abusive relationships. When we began dating, I had just moved to the state and knew no one except my family. I jumped into this relationship because we were in very similar situations with our families and I felt comfortable with having a partner facing similar challenges with their family. Please try to understand, I found out about the multiple infidelities all at the same time. This was around the 2 year mark of our relationship, I was already entangled in finances with him and had just signed a year long lease. I tried to end the relationship, but it quickly turned into a hostile living environment and I was manipulated into trying the relationship again to make the living situation better. That lease ends in 1 week. I am bringing this to Reddit because after all this time, I have been gaslighted so many times that I genuinely cannot tell if I\u2019m the a-hole. He has been trying to make efforts to maintain our relationship and reconcile over the last year, as a result, he says I don\u2019t treat him well and I\u2019m much less forgiving which makes it hard for him to actually put effort into helping me trust him again. By next week, I will be moved back into my parents home, without him. I showed my parents this thread and everyone\u2019s comments and they fully agree that they are done allowing him to mooch off of them and disrespect their daughter so consistently within the same breathe. Thank you to everyone for the advice and encouragement, this was the much needed push for me to move on with my life.

Because of the previous mishaps with planning holidays the past two years, we did discuss this years plans heavily.

My issue is that if he had actually told his family, I\u2019m 110% sure they would see zero issue and even expect it, his parents and I do not speak, but are on cordial terms. I am starting to get the impression that he never even told his family the plan and ran out of time to let them know.

If he can't be honest with his parents and strings you and your family along until the last minute, he's being very disrespectful and I fully understand you being mad.\n\nMy initial suggestion was going to be that you:\n\n* do holidays separately for the time being (I was going to say this before realizing you were already living together)\n* you both go to both and spend a bit of time with each family\n* go together to one family for thanksgiving and then to the other family for Christmas (this is what we do with Xmas eve's dinner/Xmas' day lunch as we don't have thanksgiving)\n\nBut for the last two to work you'd need to be able to attend the holidays at his parents, which I understood, from the original post, wasn't a possibility.\n\nIf you're not welcome at your in-laws your deal of you spending it with your parents is perfectly fine. And he could do 50-50 on both holidays or spend one with you and one with his family or both with you or both with his family. All of these options are fine.\n\nI don't think the issue is with the option you guys chose or with how much time he had to talk to his parents.

I don't think you get to be upset if he chooses to be at his parents or even if he was planning to be with you and changed his mind for his mother's sake and asks you to tell your parents.

The cheating your forgave but you draw the line at skipping Thanksgiving. Hrow a spine, YTA to yourself.\n\n If you want to keep riding the hot mess express to dysfunction junction, kindly leave us out of it.", "Maybe even a different girlfriend", "Honestly the infidelities is way more justification than any of this arguing about holidays stuff. I'm sorry if that isn't helpful but it is *so* hard for me to focus on who said what and why when there's a big 'ol \"he cheated on you\" mountain towering overhead. NTA\n\nIf you can't get out right now financially that's fine OP, I get it, but you need an escape plan that you are actively working towards. Separate as much as you can bit by bit and for the love of god don't have sex and risk having *children* with this asshole!", "OP I hope you get away from this guy and his family. You deserve better. NtA", "He isn\u2019t a grown up yet. Dump him and walk away with your head held high.", "This situation has nothing to do with him cheating or not (unless I skipped over something in your post.) If you want to try to make it work after infidelities it\u2019s your choice, I feel people can change IF THEY WANT TO. Sound like ya\u2019ll need a come to Jesus talk to discuss the future of this relationship; if so BOTH need to give equal\n\nI 44 female come from a divorce/ blended family, started with my mom & dad; my mom got remarried twice. Growing up I would split holidays, dad-moms family then stepdad family. Then I had kids (mom divorced step dad after 10+ years) so one family out another added in. \nWhen I divorced my ex husband we tried working together on splitting time with the kids 2 boys 18 months apart; some family celebrities black Friday so we tried to make it work. \nHe started seeing his current wife we still try to work things out (I liked Easter he like Halloween so I got Easter & he got Halloween  every year) At some point (maybe when they got married things got difficult because they needed to now go to stepmom family. We tried our best to work together but for awhile it had to be \u201cper the holiday\u201d parenting plan. \nI meet my forever love 52 man in 2009; his 1 girl 2 boys have huge family on both mom & dad\u2019s side (my hubby is the youngest of 12 (only boy that is not a twin. Their mom\u2019s side has is just as big. \nSo now we need to figure out how to get time for OUR blended family just hubby me & our 5 blended kids. But this kids do something with their mom\u2019s side-husband side & try to come to my family as well, that\u2019s 4 thanksgiving/Christmas.\nAt of now our kids are adults, 2 got married this year to other people with blended family so\nIt is getting hard to find a time for just our family: me, hubs, kids, their spouses/girlfriends; husband side, my side then step kids have their mom side & their partners family (and their parents are divorced/remarried. \n\nAll that to say you shouldn\u2019t have to pick one or the or the you should find a way to see both. It\u2019s not easy. Hubs & i are second fiddle. Past few\nChristmas\u2019s we had no quality time w/kids, they Came over at different times, got gifts & left. We  know everyone has millions of places to go and we don\u2019t give any guilt trips (other do) therefore we get the short end of the stick. But there is a grand baby now so we will be going back to what it was, breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner Christmas Eve, Christmas Day or day after. \n\nMy life story to say if this is a relationship you want to foster, nurture & try to work out there has to be some given and take. Ask if anyone willing to celebrate a different day. If no one is willing to changes   #1-that sucks #2 to both let everyone know you are doing that; tell them you\u2019ll get there when you can let them eat, they don\u2019t have to wait for you #3 switch it every year, thanksgiving w/his Christmas w/your family next year flip it, #4 do it at our place, make them come to you.\n\nThis can be hard but set your boundaries & stick to them. Sounds like his mom needed him,\nSounds like she made some choices & are seeing the consequences\n\nYour bf was put on in a no win situation. A heart to heart talk is needed, especially for plan\nIn a place & when explained be a united front,\nShow no weakness even of one may not necessarily like a certain thing you need to have each other back.", "NTA - I really hope he is now your ex boyfriend!", "NTA. I wonder how his devout Christian mom would feel about him cheating. You should bring it up at Christmas, if you're still together.", "NTA, RUN", "He isnt gaslighting you. Children from abused home have very codependent relationships with parents. If he could stop it he would. Go about your holidays. After the new year speak to him about some therapy. While you see your self as the main character, he has unresolved issues that have nothing to do with you.", "With the added context and everything \u2026 leave his a$$", "Leave him but first start removing ur parents name from his bills FIRST he's probably cheating Right now to be honest with you. I find it hard to believe that you guys have been together for 3 years. Non-stop, and now he just needs a week without you? And he says that his mother needs him because he knows that you don't talk to her and he thinks he can get away with the gaslight girl break and parkkkk GOOD LUCK BABE", "Your bf is spineless when it comes to his parents or he doesn't care or respect yours. Good thing you are leaving him. Good luck.", "Girl run", "Nta .. but ur not very smart either for picking a loser boyfriend .. he is literally using you and his family to help better his life . Just split ties with him and move on", "why are you still with this man??? wtfffff", "Fuck that dude entirely.  Nta.", "NTA so glad you are getting out, enjoy your freedom and big love to your family they sound great - don't let anyone come between you", "Ugh I spent 30 minutes replying & it\u2019s gone.\n1st you two need to have a come to\nJesus talk & figure out a if you want to try to work to save this relationship or not.\nIf not move on. If you do\u2019 let me tell you blended families can be tricky. \nI grew up in a blended family. My husband (52) and & I (44) have a blended family (27 F; 25, 24;  23 & 22M) my husband & his ex wife have big families (my husband is the youngest & in his only boy that\u2019s not a twin) and we have 1 grandbaby. 2\u2019kids got married this year, the others have on/off again relationships so\nwe have to work around so many different families,\nPast few Xmas the kids dropped by all different time to get presents & left. That\u2019s too hard for us so we are making a tradition; Xmas Eve, Xmas day or the day after we will be having breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner. We\u2019ve played nice too long. But the key to it is flexibility from everyone. \n\nIIF you give this relationship a chance everyone (parents) need to work on this as well \n\n1- go to both sides-explain what you are doing & tell ppl to eat, don\u2019t wait for you\n\n2-mthanksgiving with family A; Xmas with family\nB following year flip it\n\n3- you host & make everyone come to you \n\n4-go on a vacation & skip all drama \n\nIf ya\u2019ll are going to work on this relationship both sets of parents need to be willing to budge &\u2019wo", "NTA.  I'm sorry you're going through this, but he sounds like a massive AH and not worth all this drama.  It sounds like his parents will never budge on the religion thing and that will drive a wedge between you, especially since he seems to really love his momma a whole lot.", "When you say \u201cthis is my hill to die on\u201d, do you mean you\u2019re going to fight for yourself on this because it\u2019s a battle worth fighting for? Cause if yes, I agree 100%. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to forgive him for multiple infidelities, lies, and his false narratives because they shouldn\u2019t have happen. You deserve better. Your parents deserve better. From the edit, it sounds like you know and you\u2019re separating yourself. Good for you. You deserve someone who makes you feel like a priority without so many chances, who treats your parents and you correctly, and who is a good person.\n\nNTA. Good luck OP.", "Therapy!"]}
