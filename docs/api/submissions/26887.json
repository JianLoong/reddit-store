But my clothes still smell like smoke so he is probably lying. \n\nAnyways, a few months later I moved departments and I am now working in direct contact with food.

It's not like I do that each day or several days in a row. And he could just go outside to smoke because it's not allowed anyway\n\nFast forward to last week. I locked myself out and he wasn't home so I had to get a spare key from our landlord which was a whole adventure on its own. When arriving there, we talked a little and she asked me about a few things other renters had complained about like a guy parking his car in the yard.

You've asked him not to smoke in the kitchen around your clothes multiple times. The logical next step would have been you telling him you'd tell your landlord about it.\n\nThe landlord beat you to it by asking you about someone who is smoking, which likely means she's had complaints about her other tenants smelling cigarette smoke. Since it's a building where smoking isn't allowed, it's likely those tenants chose the building so they wouldn't have to deal with the smell. She'd have found out sooner rather than later.", "NTA\n\n1.  Other people in other apartments have complained about smoke.  This leads me to think the smoke is traveling through the air vents.\n\n2.  I have a sneaking suspicion that the landlord already knows who the smoking culprit is.  He just needs confirmation before doing something about it.\n\n3.  Your landlord asked if you had information on several violations in the complex.  You answered those questions.  It is not your fault your roommate continually broke the rules and your boundaries and then got kicked out.  This is just a classic example of FAFO.", "NTA, he is not supposed to be smoking inside, you asked him a few times to stop doing so and he continued.  If it's in the lease, he should not do it.

It will absorb the smoke smell.", "NTA.  You were asked a question and told the truth.  He chose to smoke knowing full well it was not allowed.

You asked him repeatedly to behave better and he chose not to. This is a common problem with smokers.
