The holier than thou act is played out. Find a new routine.", "NTA. And your wife saying to just accept it is weird. Is she condoning cheating? Or is she hoping to use OP's reaction to this as a way to gauge how he would react if she decides (or has already) to cheat?", "Your daughter cheated with her sisters boyfriend, yikes!", "NTA. Big time. Even though Sara wasn't your biological child and has passed away, she was cheated on while alive and Jane and Alex's behavior was totally inappropriate. You're right to want nothing to do with the wedding. I also don't understand your wife's attitude, she's in the wrong, too.\nI admire you for what you (and most people) believe is right!", "I feel like I might know you", "NTA. Jane and Alex shouldn\u2019t expect you to just accept them. What they did is wrong and they likely won\u2019t last anyways", "NTA", "It amazes me how many people are downvoting anyone who thinks this is not a cut-and-dried situation, who notes that OP has lost one daughter and he may lose another, and grandchildren, if he refuses to participate in this wedding. \n\nThis is not an easy yes or no. OP DOES risk losing a second daughter, and grandchildren, and Redditors who haven't faced that situation need to understand that this is an awful situation with no clear answers. I applaud those Redditors who understand this.\n\nI don't know what I'd do in OP's situation. I really don't. I'd be LOATHE to participate in this wedding (but to me cheating is one of the true deadly sins); on the other hand, having lost one daughter, would I want to possibly permanently lose the other? Lose grandchildren? I genuinely don't know. I don't think I could walk Jane down the aisle or plan or actively participate, but attend? Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe I'd take Bella out for a day together while my spouse attended the wedding. For sure, I would not denigrate my spouse for attending.\n\nThis is one of the harder questions I've seen on Reddit lately. Jane is horrid, Alex is horrid, but for a parent this is an impossibly painful situation, especially with the loss of Sara. OP, NTA, no matter what you choose to do.", "NTA - supporting Jane would be a slap in the face to Sara.", "If they will cheat WITH you, they will cheat ON you.

My dad only told me a lot of guys are assholes and he wasn't wrong lol", "Guaranteed the wife thinks that since Sarah is no longer with you, you aren\u2019t really protecting Sarah anymore", "It\u2019s in OP\u2019s comments.", "Holy shit! OP cannot go!!", ">Died in beginning of the Pandora, according to OP's comments.\n\nNow there are just too many open boxes in this story, I'm sorry.", "Really?  I enjoyed having sex with your sister.", "If they're willing to do it on the sly because they're unsure how to get out of the relationship, they're both idiots and totally still have the capacity to cheat and have demonstrated they consider it a valid option. \n\nYou don't get to violate your partner's consent and cheat (they didn't consent to a poly deal, or the risks that come with sleeping with someone with multiple partner's) and go OH POOR ME I HAD NO OTHER CHOICE THIS ISN'T ABOUT WHO I AM \n\nIt literally is. Presented with a problem, their solution was cheating. That's not an accident, that's a choice. \n\nI'm going to hold people accountable for their actions and I trust violators of consent no further than I can chuck the moon.", "I disagree.  Once you justify doing it once, I really think it gets easier to do it again.  Just like stealing, etc", "Don't want to hurt but they're cheating? Make that make sense. Also, sparks didn't die but Sara did and her and Alex were about to get married and was sleeping with both of them. \nEvery cheater who had cheated always cheats.", "Yeah there are exceptions. Look at the current King of England: he hasn't cheated on his second wife once throughout their marriage but slept around on his first one left right and centre. \n\nThen again he's a rare case, and the people I've known who have cheated had no problem repeating or trying to. Most prominent example I've known: my ex-friend in grad school dumped her amazing fianc\u00e9 (a sweet guy any single girl would kill for) to date my boyfriend (now husband)'s flatmate after openly cheating on the former with the latter for 4 months. Yet just weeks after she began dating the flatmate, a single argument between the two caused her to immediately start making a play for my boyfriend (behind her own boyfriend's back) and trying to break up our relationship, despite having previously stated she wouldn't ever date a guy like him. (When my boyfriend rejected her advances, she resorted to some erm dangerous stuff to try to get me out of the picture.) And she was so sure she could get with my boyfriend that a mutual friend even told me that she even mentioned having the next guy lined up for when she succeeded.", "And with your sister?", "You might be a redneck if you get married again and still have the same inlaws", "YUP\n\nCheating is a *~choice~*", "That isn't true. Charles had other affairs too. I can remember only one name now - Kanga.", "I have no problem if his wife goes and he shouldnt stop her from going. In the post he has not stopped the wife from going all he has said is that he wont be going. \n\nIf she chooses not to go because her husband would not go thats not on OP. She shouldn't force people to go when they don't want to. \n\nJane should not expect her father to just be fine with all of this when its clear she has not made any effort to make amends. She cannot expect her father to magically approve of the marriage. She wants acceptance and she should understand that she wont get it. It clear she only wants everyone to think everything is happy happy for the wedding pictures and i suspect thats what OPs wife is doing as well. \n\nOP isnt doing this to be \"right\". Going to the wedding would be a sign of acceptance that Jane and Alex do not deserve.", "Ha ha!", "no u didn't", "She ok with it because Sarah was adopted", "When a person marries their side piece/affair partner, an opening is created.", "Ohh I like that. Never heard it that way before. My grandma Sophie always refused to marry my great grandpa because \"if he'll cheat with you he'll cheat on you\" and she wasn't going to financially or legally tie herself to a man she had an affair with. They stayed together the rest of their lives though. Something like 30 years", "LOL in that case I'll lose my husband through a friend, at the pub", "Oof that's a good way to look at it", "Yeah my ex's affair partner has been finding this out the hard way for the last 5 years. She's due to marry him later this year :/ Big mistake!", "Thankfully a scenario I will NEVER have to deal with as my sis doesnt deal with men, lol.  And my brothers are both straight. Cause ICK! Thats sharing to a NASTY level.", "all of this. if she cuts OP off for this thats on her she should never have expected OP to come even after he has already expressed his disapproval", "Exactly. In the post it says I \u201chave\u201d 3 daughters leading to believe that Sara is still alive. I don\u2019t know if it really makes a difference but it should be noted in the post.", "I never defended Jane or what she did. Nor did I excuse anything.\n\nI simply asked what OP thinks they are going to get out of this, other than losing a second daughter. \n\nIt\u2019s not reasonable to expect that Jane not continue the relationship. They\u2019ve been together for five years and are getting married. In terms of stopping it, the ship has sailed.\n\nIf OP boycotts the wedding and can\u2019t accept their relationship, OP won\u2019t be able to have a relationship with Jane and will be busted down to just one daughter.  Although registering offense may be the most important thing on Reddit, in actual life it rarely is and you usually don\u2019t get as much as you\u2019d think out of it.", "It's the level of pettiness I live for though. Wrongly or rightly!", "I won\u2019t even borrow a bathing suit from my sister, let alone a fianc\u00e9.", "I imagine that as a parent it would be really hard to come to terms with the death of a child to the point where you become even remotely comfortable enough to mention them in the past tense-no matter how much time has passed.", "I find that I\u2019ve gained more peace in life by looking at situations and forgiving people who\u2019ve wronged me regardless of whether they feel remorseful, if I can find an explanation for it or if I can see them being an overall decent person apart from whatever they did to me. People are complex, weird, contradictory creatures and I believe we are all more than the worst thing we\u2019ve ever done. I think when emotions get involved that people can behave in ways that are otherwise odd for them. It gives me a lot of peace to be able to forgive and extend charity towards others. Even in small things, like people being bad drivers\u2014 my wife will curse, but I\u2019ll think maybe they sneezed and that\u2019s why they swerved. Or they\u2019re driving too fast bc they\u2019re about to pee themselves. Or they just got off an excessively long odd hours shift and desperately need sleep. It isn\u2019t even that I\u2019m doing it consciously now, though I did have to make an effort when I first started trying to attribute the best explanations to others. Plus, people will often rise to the level they are treated. If you want people to be good to others, you shouldn\u2019t cast them aside forever. I\u2019ll admit I do struggle with resentment for my wife bc she was something of an absentee parent and partner for our daughter\u2019s first two years, but I\u2019m not going to shun her; I\u2019m going to help her be better and encourage her to continue treating her depression and make a choice every day to forgive her for how she neglect me and our relationship in a vulnerable time.", "You sound exhausting. Please, forgive me for saying that.", "If there\u2019s any cosmic justice, Sara will haunt the SHIT out of Jane and Alex. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss, OP. I lost my sister in 2020, too.", "If I was Sarah and this happened to me, I would go Amityville on those 2.", "I agree the ex that ghosted me and cheated on me 1 of his kids is not his then his family doesn\u2019t like her behind their back they say they prefer me and say what he married she.

The girl literally slept with her sisters fiance lmao.", "INFO: what does Sara think / want?", "Jane cheated too.

She's trying to sweep *cheating* under the rug because 1) Sara wasn't \"really\" her daughter, and 2) She's not \"here\" anymore. Even if she won't admit to those, her actions say it loud and clear. \n\nMaybe you should ask your wife to imagine how *she* would feel if you cheated on her  with her sister and then later married the sister? Would she let it go, or \"hold a grudge?\" \n\nI'm very sorry you're in this position. I REALLY hope you stick to your guns and DON'T go to that wedding. Maybe you and your other daughter can make a day out of it or go on a vacation that weekend.", "She has Bella as well", "OP has written Sara passed in the comments.", "Can I say something not being disrespectful.

I don\u2019t blame her for not wanting to willingly lose another daughter. Thank god the real world isn\u2019t as black and white as Reddit makes it out to be.", "I think I just gagged ew", "Honestly given the situation as long as no on is forced into doing something that they dont want to do then im fine with it.
