You don't support the relationship and for a good reason.  You made that clear the whole time.  How does Sara feel about Jane's wedding?  Her opinion carries a lot of weight here too.  If Sara is over it, has forgiven Jane, and is going to the wedding then you probably can too.  This has clearly driven a wedge between your family though, since Bella agrees with you and won't be going either but your wife will likely be attending.", "NTA given the circumstances.

You would be there for your daughter, not for Alex. It's a huge life choice that she is making. \n\nThat being said, if you end up not going anyways, at least send a card or a small gift acknowledging it.
