She sounds the type to not allow people to visit  who may not have attended the wedding?", "YTA\n\nSure it sucked but are you really gonna fuck your family up, destroy opportunity of family reunion and loose your relationship with your daughter and future grandchildren over this?", "Divorce your wife if she is willing to put up with this. You do not want to be associated with morals like that \nNTA", "NTA. Jane and your wife are total AH", "NTA, cheaters and cheater enablers are horrible.", "NTA\n\nIt takes two to tango both are equally to blame  \nAnd totally out of touch is they think everyone must just go with it and forget   \nPoor Sara", "You are NTA.\n\nYour wife sounds like a piece of work, Why is she alright with this?", "Jane is lucky that her family still speaks to her at all. I would only look at such a person with my butt if I met her somewhere.", "Yeah, did not see that twist coming. Damn.", "Her own sister betrayed her. That\u2019s bad enough. Then Sara passes and Jane and Alex STAY together?! \n\nYeah I wouldn\u2019t call this holding onto a grudge. Theirs is a relationship built on lies and betrayal and neither feel remorse even after Sara passed.\n\nNTA. Good for you and Bella standing up for Sara!", "Nah he tripped and his dick fell in her and she was just like \"oh well\"", "There's a wise saying: when a man marries his mistress, he creates a vacancy.", "If a man cheats with you, he will cheat on you.", "The older daughter passed away in 2020.", "Sara died in 2020 \ud83d\ude1f but yes still nta and neither is the other sister who won't go either", "I was thinking the same. I'm sure I recently read this nearly exact story.", "Sara died in 2020, but yes take Bella out stull", "It took me way too long to find a comment that resonates with me. I would be concerned about losing contact not only with the daughter but potential grandchildren.

One of her children died fairly recently. She\u2019s grieving and that can mess up your brain. As a mom I can understand that she\u2019s desperate to maintain a relationship with a her two living daughters, however morally questionable one of them may be. \n\nOP is NTA and he shouldn\u2019t go to a wedding he doesn\u2019t support, I\u2019ll agree with that.", "Even if you give them the benefit of the doubt that they have a true love that they couldn\u2019t ignore or something, and they\u2019re faithfully married for the next 60 years (lol), it still takes a lot of nerve to expect anyone from that part of your life to come to the wedding.", "Only look at them with my butt.

Ever since then, that's been a euphemism in my circle.  \"Gonna go slip and fall\"", "Not wise at all. Second marriages last better than first ones.", "I guess we found a cheater. This can only come from someone who is trying to make excuses for their own infidelity.", "damn, my dude here going for the world record in downvoted comments in one thread", "I can't imagine how the guilt is not eating up at them. And their fucking audacity to invite you there!! IDC if I'm banned, Fuck them.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. I guess your wife is the boat steadier in the family. I hope you made your point clear to your wife and she leaves you alone.", "I think the other story was from the daughter\u2019s perspective and she left out that her sister took her own life. She got roasted for it, especially leaving out key details.", "So was his dick apparently", "That's what she said", "Balls deep.", "Deep would suggest that there\u2019s some substance to the man, and he honestly sounds kind of shallow.", "That or he's just projecting his cheating, and saying these things will somehow validate his actions!?\n\nDude needs help or a partner who cheats", "Can't forgive one who hasn't asked for forgiveness.", "If I know my daughter is marrying a confirmed cheater and an asshole who hurt my other daughter, I would be livid too.

No. Are you OK?", "I get what you\u2019re saying but show some fucking empathy", "Oh, so Alex cheated because he already knew Sara was going to die?", "Is this Jane?", "Disgusting", "Alex cheated on Sarah with her sister. He blew up their relationship while breaking apart their family, but since Sarah died two years after all of this they should just accept him into the family with open arms?", "So what you're saying is ok if I screw someone over as long as they end up dead?
