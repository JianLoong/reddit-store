You are not holding a grudge, you are just protecting Sara. Belle is protecting her sister too.", "NTA.\n\nOne daughter happy doesn\u2019t cancel out one daughter hurt, especially when one is the direct result of the other.", "NTA hard stop.", "Info: how does Sara feel about the situation?", "This is hard but I\u2019m going to say NTA here, the reality is that Jane and Alex did one of your other daughters wrong. I want to say you should still support your daughter but I think supporting the one who was wronged is more important in this circumstance. I think you should leave the door open for reconciliation though, if Jane and Alex choose to be big people and accept the blame.", "NTA\n\nJane sounds like a pretty shitty sister and Alex sounds like a pretty shitty person in general", "NTA.  You don't support the relationship and for a good reason.  You made that clear the whole time.  How does Sara feel about Jane's wedding?  Her opinion carries a lot of weight here too.  If Sara is over it, has forgiven Jane, and is going to the wedding then you probably can too.  This has clearly driven a wedge between your family though, since Bella agrees with you and won't be going either but your wife will likely be attending.", "NTA given the circumstances. It's made harder by Sara not being here to give her opinion on the situation but it feels like the pain Jane caused Sara still causes you pain too.\n\nAlso, I'm sorry for your loss.\n\n(it might also be worth updating the original post with the fact that Sara has passed, as that feels relevant)", "NTA. Crappy situation and no way I would attend if I were you.", "NTA and good for you. If she hasn't apologized she aint gonna be forgiven.", "NTA, I\u2019d never support relationships based off of infidelity either", "(Wasn't there an extremely similar story a few months ago??)\n\nAnyway, NTA. Cheaters suck.", "NTA.  \n\n\nI don't think they understand. They both betrayed somebody they loved, somebody you love. They are not trustworthy people, if they could hurt Sara than they could do that to anybody including you. They're bad people, full stop. Keep them away from you and your family, I'm sorry this has happened but sometimes people just come out... wrong.", "Info: How does Sara feel about all this? Not saying you have to do what she says, but if she's forgiven her sister / ex, you should probably find a way to also...\n\n(Edited to remove an additional question that was clearly answered in the original post that I just missed)\n\nEdit 2: OP states that Sara passed away in 2020 - leaving this here in case anybody else had the same question", "Your daughter needs to realize how she got him is how she will lose him.

If your middle daughter is old enough to be a home wrecker, then she's old enough to realise actions have consequences. This will obviously significantly damage your relationship with your middle daughter, but if you go to the wedding, imagine what it'll do to your oldest daughter.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nShe'll be running back to you when he does the same to her. \n\nBoth of their behaviour is abhorrent.", "Nah Jane sucks big time & Alex ain\u2019t a prize either.

I would have cut Jane off when it happened.  She isn't someone I would be proud to be a parent of.", "My condolences. NTA, Some actions have long last consequences and this is one of them. I hope you & Bella plan a special night together.", "NTA.  What begins in evil will end in evil.  Jane's chosen a road that cannot be undone.", "nta\n\njane was the one that caused this to happen and hurt her relationship with her sisters...she can't expect people to agree to come to her wedding", "What is Sara\u2019s opinion?  This is a really shitty situation but you should ask Sara what to do", "NTA. You're a good parent. Being part of Jane's marriage will mean negation of Sara's pain. It's already painful to see that her own sis betrayed her. It'll be hard if she were to face betrayal once again from u \ud83d\ude2a \n\nJane and Alex made their choice. You made yours!", "Nta. You\u2019re a good dad.", "NTA, but do know with this decision that you are saying goodbye to Jane. Likely permanently.", "NTA, but I think you'll regret not going. You've made it clear on your thoughts towards him, and Jane refuses to accept it. She will need your support, even if you come to the ceremony and not attend the party. You would be there for your daughter, not for Alex. It's a huge life choice that she is making. \n\nThat being said, if you end up not going anyways, at least send a card or a small gift acknowledging it. Things will go the way that it will go", "NTA, but do you really want to lose another daughter? Yes, Jane and Alex did something bad. But- they were apparently correct that they were meant for each other And now they will be permanently. When they have a child will you refuse to see your grandchild? Will you avoid your daughter forever? Forgiveness is a powerful thing, and this seems like a case that was made for it. It is the only way to keep from destroying your family.
