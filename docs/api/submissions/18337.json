I sat on my sister's bed and a spring came out and right in the ass", "Yeah, it's called tact.", "Men generally are pressured to be \"strong\" or resilient, and generally actually are physically stronger than women, so men being hurt is generally considered to be less significant than women being hurt. Even among men. It's pretty much a tale as old as time, \"Save the women and children!\"\n\nI don't really see periods or childbirth being downplayed unless women are talking about them only to say that being kicked in the balls isn't a big deal. A guy will say being hit in the balls hurts really bad (a fact), and half the time a woman will say, \"Uh ackshually childbirth and periods and etc are way worse.\" It's just minimizing male pain and needlessly antagonistic. Then men may minimize female pain, but it's only because they're being put on the defensive in the first place. That doesn't make it right, but the context does matter.\n\nRegarding doctors, I feel your pain. I went through all these ridiculous shenanigans trying antidepressants for the better part of a year, and the doctors were very unhelpful. In the meantime, I feel horrible, gaining weight, suicidal thoughts all the time. I feel like anyone regularly going to the doctor for something would find it hard not to lose faith in them a bit. Idk about a gender gap, but it's possible. I think more doctors are men, so they may not understand how some of these women's issues feel. Though to be fair they all go to med school, it's not like a female doctor knowing how it feels actually changes the treatment options, but I would probably rather have a male doc for some stuff myself It's a tad sexist, but you don't want to be uncomfortable with your doctor.\n\nThere are other men's issues that are pretty much ignored, or when brought up, people only consider the female counterpart. Like suicide and mental health, for one. I hear women blame this on \"toxic masculinity\" and basically imply men deserve it as a result. And the idea of toxic masculinity is effectively a demonization of male interests and behaviors. It's no better than a man degrading feminine things, but you never hear anyone talk about \"toxic femininity,\" unless they're responding to someone who brought up toxic masculinity.\n\nCircumcision is another, it is minimized all the time. Fgm is objectively worse, but people will vehemently oppose FGM without even considering that male circumcision might be a bit questionable. Literally the first thing they do to men is chop off a bit of their weiner skin, (which actually is super important) and pretty much everyone acts like it's fine. People are more likely to criticize piercing a baby's ears, than criticize circumcising a baby.\n\nIt's also generally seen as more politically correct to insult a man's penis size than it is to insult a woman's breast size. Men might claim something like women's vaginas are looser after childbirth. Women rightfully get upset. But women will make fun of men's penises or sexual prowess, and men are afraid to even respond because they don't want people to think they have a tiny pecker or are bad at sex.\n\nWomen can criticize and insult with impunity, as men consider it \"weak\" to respond. Women will continue their misandry, by saying, \"The only reason why men are worried about appearing weak is because of their own toxic masculinity.\" Yet I've seen more women tell men to \"man up\" than men. In general, women do not understand masculinity, or men, so they're generally more toxic about it than many men even are. This stuff really just goes on an on. I don't hate women or feel like men are super oppressed or something, it's just annoying to see this stuff all the time. Basically any criticism of women by men is seen as sexist, but the opposite isn't only not sexist, but also always a good thing because men are all evil incels or something.", "\"Dog whistle\" is a dog whistle for, \"I disagree with your beliefs, have no rebuttal, but still want to act like I'm superior and right somehow.\"\n\nAnd getting hit in the balls is not all that funny, it's like baby's first joke or something.
