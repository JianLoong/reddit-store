It's nice that your bro invites her to his, but its equally nice that you just want to spend it with your partner.

Your brother had clearly been inviting your mom and many other family members to join on anniversaries, and make it a family dinner. So your mom may have assumed that you're do the same.

Plus, she has said terrible, horrible things over the years and her brother is golden, she is the scapegoat.  She really needs to go NC.  For her mom it is all about her."]}
