The issue at hand concerns our neighbors.\n\nJohn (30m) and his wife Jane (25f) have a set of twins that are a year old . So sometimes , Hannah and they will have a playdate with the younger ones . But recently , they\u2019ve been using the play dates as a way to dump their kids on Hannah and the rest of us . Sometimes for hours without answering the phone . \n\nNow , I love kids and would be more then happy to babysit them . But , we are all ether working , in college or both. So more often we\u2019ve ether been late to class or work cause we can\u2019t contact John or Jane . \n\nYesterday , the four of us were preparing to go out for lunch and get some shopping done . As we were leaving , John stopped us and said he needed Hannah to watch his kids while he went out to see a movie . \n\nI told him we aren\u2019t babysitters and if they the kids with us again without answering. We\u2019d call social services , to which he called a bunch of spineless leeches . \n\nThe other parents in the complex said that we were harsh to new parents and to have more compassion.", "created_utc": 1684644261, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13nj4b6/aita_for_telling_my_neighbor_that_my_roommates/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Project much.\n\nTell those parents in the complex that you\u2019ll tell John they have volunteered to watch his kids.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nThe neighbors are being TA. \n\nHannah is a new parent too. \n\nAnyone saying you need \"more compassion\" and to \"be less harsh\" is welcome to, and should, go randomly get taken advantage of to watch the kids for hours with no notice. \n\nThat's ridiculous. You did great attending up politely and clearly for your group.", "Spineless leeches?!? \n\nHa ha\u2026 that\u2019s real funny coming from someone who is actually leeching. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. They aren\u2019t your kids, not your responsibility.", "NTA\n\n> he called a bunch of spineless leeches\n\nBold words from someone who dumps their kids on unsuspecting neighbors and won\u2019t answer their phone.\n\nAlso that he expected you to drop your plans so he could watch a movie.", "Follow through with the social services call if they do it again.", "NTA. It\u2019s completely unacceptable for parents to be unreachable for hours even when someone is being paid to watch their children, let alone dumping them on a neighbour. They do deserve a break and they can hire a babysitter to do so. You were far too polite in my opinion, good for you for putting an end to this exploitation.", "NTA\n\nLol at the other parents in the complex calling them \u2018new parents\u2019 - what\u2019s Hannah then? \n\nAlso, I bet all the other parents are older than you guys and thought they could exploit you because of that. Good on you for shutting that shit down.", "NTA. They wanted a baby, they need to figure out childcare without inconveniencing neighbors.", "Hahaha, you're the leech because you won't give them free child care?  NTA, but I'd just stop dealing with them. If they get mad over that, then I'm sure they will only cause you more drama in the future.", "NTA. Good for you! If they want a babysitter then they need to pay for it. nNo one NEEDS to go to a movie.", "NTA, you have lives and obligations as well, and you stood your ground and called them out for taking advantage of you guys.  Stand your ground the next time they try to pull this stunt too.", "NTA. You are literally being taken advantage of and are right to put your foot down. Good for you for saying what\u2019s up.", ">he called a bunch of spineless leeches\n\nWell, pot meet kettle. OP, you are NTA. Good for you, standing up for yourself!!", "NTA and well done. They really needed to be told. Compassion? Maybe. Anything else, no. The only leeches here are John and Jane.", "> So more often we\u2019ve ether been late to class or work cause we can\u2019t contact John or Jane.\n\nNTA  Once it became obvious that these parents were taking advantage of you and had no regard for your needs, you had no obligation to sugar-coat the truth.  And those other people who think you need to have more compassion?  Yeah, they can lead by example and be John and Jane's free babysitters.", "NTA", "OP you're not legally responsible for them, and if something were to happen while they were in your care you're basically screwed.  Any future discussion regarding the twins just needs to be relayed that for potential liability reasons, you're unable to not do them any more favors of babysitting and just move on and explain that to the complex busy bodies if they press the issue.  No one likes the law involved when it comes to children.", "NTA. Even if they weren't taking advantage of you, both of them being unavailable by phone for hours at a time more than once with relative strangers babysitting your one year old twins is ridiculous. That's just flat out parental neglect.", "Do they do anything for you guys at all financially or otherwise? Why did he say leech or he\u2019s really that fried?", "NTA. Haha ha, really a movie???? Drinking, gambling, looking for drugs or other diversions more like it.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing, your neighbours have shitty boundaries. While it may cause Hannah's baby some upset (although at 8 months old I'm sure she'll forget them pretty quickly), I would find her a different playdate as they will continue to do this.", "NTA\n\nIt's not your fault they put a pole in a hole and filled it like a cream pie.\n\nThey need to learn how to raise their own kids before these two will end up losing them", "NTA - call social services next time.", "???? NTA YOU'RE the spineless leeches? because you refused to let them dump their kids on you while they vanish into the ether? ya, YOU GUYS are the leeches in this situation", "NTA, they kids are a year old, they are not new parents.  This was not an emergency, he wanted to go see an f---ing movie. Sorry but you had plans.  For the next person that says you were an AH ask for their contact info as you will hand it over so that they can babysit.", ">The other parents in the complex said that we were harsh to new parents and to have more compassion.\n\nINFO: Have you ever previously expressed your dissatisfaction to them about the issue? If so what did you say to them and what did they say in return?", "NTA\n\nThose new parents should take babysit then or find out the whole story before deciding to make judgement. Your neighbor obviously is taking advantage and abusing the generosity you 4 have given them.", "NTA. The effin leeches are John and Jane. Dam these people why even have kids if they\u2019re going to pass them on to others because they can\u2019t handle them or need a break. For the parents in the complex they should step up to the plate and watch the leeches twins from now on.", "NTA.", "Nta, they think they could just pawn off their kids when ever they like.", "NTA", "NTA and their attitude is dangerous. Please don\u2019t be afraid to call CPS if you have any concerns", "NTA\n\nI would never leave my 1 year old with acquaintances and not pick up my phone. That would take a family emergency and be unwilling.", "Not a bad idea . I have his phone number might put free summer babysitting ads all over the complex", "Best idea in this thread !", "Exactly , the rest of the roommates and I have no problem watching Hannah\u2019s daughter as she\u2019s trying to finish her degree and make a career . \n\nJohn and his wife are the people who peaked in high school and still act like it . Which is annoying as hell", "We wouldn\u2019t mind watching the kids if it was an emergency but 90 percent of the time it isn\u2019t . Literally one night , Casey saw them at a club plastered beyond belief while Hannah and I were trying to figure out how to put the twins to sleep", "Oh believe me I wanted to say so much more but we were hungry and had to get food for the apartment . Cause four college students and a baby go through quite a bit of food", "You are correct , many of the other parents are 30s to 40s . I think Hannah might be the only one under 22 who\u2019s a mom . As far as I know .", "Did you just say John is a spineless leech? \ud83e\udd23", "Side thing?", "Luckily Casey and Nellie both have siblings with kids close in age to Hannah\u2019s child . So we are working something out with them", "After the second time we told them , we understood being new parents and working but that they can\u2019t keep doing this . But Hannah is a people pleaser and has a hard time saying no to others", "What\u2019s funny is most of them have kids that are like 11 to 17 . Prime age for babysitting , I\u2019m half tempted to tell them if they want to show compassion , have thier kids do it for free", "Do it!", "And even more annoying the neighbors are disrespectful to you all and unappreciated and uncommunicative. \n\nNTA. On so many levels. \n\nIts so sweet yall help Hannah! I'm glad she and her mini me has yall! \u2764\ufe0f", "They\u2019re getting free babysitting. They can pay for that, or stop asking for non-emergencies. That\u2019s awful they feel so entitled to leave their babies (with no way to contact) to go clubbing .", "If they want the be nice to new parents then they can watch the kids for free and see how it is", "Yes, and I'm not ashamed of it. If he wants to call someone who doesn't have to babysit the kids he has a spineless leech then by his logic he is also a spineless leech because he doesn't want to watch them.", "Where's _their_ compassion for Hannah?  Isn't she a \"new mother\" too? Is it ok for her to get others kids dumped on her? Give me a break.  \n\nYou all all stood up for your friend together.", "The kids are a year old, this is pushing the new parent title.", "Quite frankly I don\u2019t think that these are john\u2019s first kids . Something tells me he has a second family or a baby mama or three on the side he hasn\u2019t told Jane about", "Does he work or is he a stay at home dad?"]}
