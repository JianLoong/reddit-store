Midnight of his 18th, kicked out. Walked a few miles in the pouring rain to, I believe, his aunts. A couple of days later the parents asked family in a group chat is anyone had seen the kid. OP consulted kid, kid said \u201cI don\u2019t want them to know\u201d so OP said \u201chaven\u2019t seen them.\u201d Somehow they found out that OP was letting son stay there.
