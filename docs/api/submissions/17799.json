As we were leaving , John stopped us and said he needed Hannah to watch his kids while he went out to see a movie . \n\nI told him we aren\u2019t babysitters and if they the kids with us again without answering.

Good on you for shutting that shit down.", "NTA.

There is some stereotyping happening here along with some expectations of you simply because you\u2019re a woman.  \n\nPersonally, going to see a movie and wanting childcare without notice is pretty damn selfish.
