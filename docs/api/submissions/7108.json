As the eldest daughter I was always responsible for my siblings birthday's, even if it were time where we couldn't afford cakes/ sweets I'd still be the one to come up with something to save the situation and they always have friends throw them parties and they'd come home with a tons of presents. On the other hand, my birthday's aren't celebrated, I do get wishes if one of my younger siblings remember and mention it. My mom would take Me out for lunch and that'd be it. Never had friends to celebrate with me after moving out 6 years ago and I know I should be grateful to even have a nice meal out, im also very happy to see my siblings have good friends but it gets pretty lonely and really upsetting that I don't get a quarter of that effort from anyone on my birthday.\n\nMe and my boyfriend (m21) have been dating for almost a year now and this was my first birthday since we got together. Non of my family members seemed to remember my birthday and I didn't remind them anyway but I had the best birthday ever in years and possibly the best I've ever had. I went back home holding present boxes and that was when my mom remembered and got really upset because I chose my boyfriend over her and spending time with my siblings especially that it's my 20th a milestone to be celebrated with family. I reminded her how she didn't even remember it was my birthday until that moment but her excuse was being busy and stressed and how I was using this against her when I could have kindly reminded her. Am I really overreacting and being an AH?\n\nEdit: To everyone who wished me a happy birthday, Thank you so so much this literally means alot to me.

For your child you make every effort to celebrate with a cake, a cupcake, some ice cream or just a honey bun from the gas station. You make decorations. You sing happy birthday.

The issue is not telling them, until they found out in a way that was humiliating. Birthdays are the kind of things it's sometimes a good idea to remind people of. In this case, your mother seeing the gifts you brought home raised a fuss with her. I'm not understanding why you didn't mention your birthday plans to the people who lived with you. Most people would say something like \"\\[boyfriend's name\\] is taking me out for my birthday\" whether or not their family was remembering. If the family is forgetful, it's a hint. If they're not, it helps them work out their own schedule.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why can\u2019t OPs own mother even remember until she had a huge clue?  If op\u2019s own family really cared, they would have attempted to make plans with OP, BEFORE the actual day, without having to be reminded. We aren\u2019t taking about your acquaintance from work forgetting your bday. This is immediate family.", "Why should OP have said anything? She made it clear that the rest of her family has long since volun-told her to be the keeper of birthdays for the family. Arranging for special treats and who knows what.\n\nWhere at the same time, nobody else in the family makes anything of an effort for her. To the point that all she gets is a \"happy birthday\" and maybe lunch with mom. When she gets anything at all. (gotta wonder how many of her past birthdays went completely unremarked)\n\nYou talk of the family being humiliated. Consider for a moment how humiliating it would be to know that if you want to get anything special to happen for your birthday you **have** to drop hints and reminders. To have to tell them \"My BF is taking me out for my birthday.\" Not so that they know that's what your plans are for the day. But just so that they'll even remember what day it is.\n\nNot just once, either, but for years. Which it sounds like that is the position OP has been in. And the longer it goes on, the more humiliating it would become.\n\nBut this year was different. OP has someone in her life now that didn't need hints and reminders. That got her gifts and made plans with her all on his own. Someone that actually cared to make an effort.\n\nOP is NTA.\n\nAnd personally, I hope she uses this as an incentive to stop being the birthday calendar & organizer for the rest of the family. Not to humiliate them, though they might experience more of that. But so that they'll finally take responsibility for doing their own part in making an effort for each other.", "I looked at this and thought, there's no way anyone could possibly do enough mental gymnastics to find a way to blame OP. Then there were to prove to me some people will reach and stretch until they can come up with a way to blame someone for not being a doormat. You should be proud, I'm sure that took a lot of brain power."]}
