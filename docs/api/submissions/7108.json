On the other hand, my birthday's aren't celebrated, I do get wishes if one of my younger siblings remember and mention it. My mom would take Me out for lunch and that'd be it. Never had friends to celebrate with me after moving out 6 years ago and I know I should be grateful to even have a nice meal out, im also very happy to see my siblings have good friends but it gets pretty lonely and really upsetting that I don't get a quarter of that effort from anyone on my birthday.\n\nMe and my boyfriend (m21) have been dating for almost a year now and this was my first birthday since we got together. Non of my family members seemed to remember my birthday and I didn't remind them anyway but I had the best birthday ever in years and possibly the best I've ever had. I went back home holding present boxes and that was when my mom remembered and got really upset because I chose my boyfriend over her and spending time with my siblings especially that it's my 20th a milestone to be celebrated with family. I reminded her how she didn't even remember it was my birthday until that moment but her excuse was being busy and stressed and how I was using this against her when I could have kindly reminded her.

In this case, your mother seeing the gifts you brought home raised a fuss with her. I'm not understanding why you didn't mention your birthday plans to the people who lived with you.

Consider for a moment how humiliating it would be to know that if you want to get anything special to happen for your birthday you **have** to drop hints and reminders.

Move on, live your life, make your own family and always have the cake on your birthday.   Happy 20th - I hope it's a wonderful year for you.", "Happy Birthday to you young lady from Australia. \n\nAnd NTA at all...", "NTA . I don't reply to things often but this one I had to. My birthday was on Tuesday and I'm in the exact sane boat as you. Im the eldest of 5. To make it even worse my mums birthday is the day before mine and everyone remembers hers but forgets mine! \n\nEvery year I've watched as they get great treats and surprises on their days and I'm lucky if I even get a phone call. For my sisters 18th they got her a trip to London, for my brothers they get him a trip to Germany, for me? I got a cheap \u00a310 bracelet and not even a card. I don't even wear jewellery. It's the same for Christmas.\n\nAs I've gotten older I've realised family is who you decide it is, not the one your born into. Screw them! Have a fun day every year without them!\n\nOh and Happy birthday :)", "Happy Cake Day OP!! \n\nNTA, btw", "NTA Happy birthday!\n\nYour Mum is only making a fuss because seeing the presents made her feel guilty for being a bad mum. That is not your problem. If she wants to be a good mum, she can write your birthday in the family calendar like every other normal family.", "NTA", "NTA really if they can't be bothered to keep track of when your birthday is they don't deserve to celebrate it with you. Your boyfriend sounds awesome.", "NTA Happy birthday though.", "Happy cake day \ud83c\udf82", " >And I do think it's important to treat others with the same courtesy most people would ordinarily get.\n\nShe is treating them with the same courtesy they have given her birthday over the last 20 years. \n\nYou want her to go above and beyond and keep hoping her family will eventually recognize her Birthday.\n\n>The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results."]}
