I was raised pretty strictly Catholic, but have since about age 17 I have publicly not participated in religion and would not consider myself a Catholic anymore. I have respect for my family members who remain religious and try my best to maintain the peace.\n\nI've been with my fiance (32M) for the past 5 years and we've been engaged for 1.5 years. It upset my parents and my more religious siblings when we moved in together, but not enough to cause huge drama (they might mention that we shouldn't be living together, or that we should get married, but not more than that).\n\nMy brother (29M) and his wife (30F) are very devout Catholics. My fiance and I were present and helped with their engagement, I was a bridesmaid in their wedding, and they actually were also present for my engagement. Since neither myself nor my fiance are religious, our wedding will be fully secular -- vows and everything but not in a church, etc.\n\nMy brother told me and my fiance that he and his wife wished to take \"a less active role\" in our wedding. I was surprised, since the only thing we had asked from them was to stand (like bridesmaids/groomsmen) around us while we say our vows (we wanted to each be flanked by our brothers and their partners). We weren't even going to have people walking down an aisle, just myself and my fiance.\n\nAfter I had time to mull it over, I realized that my brother doesn't want to publicly or privately support my marriage. Although I respect his religious beliefs, this has pained me to the point of doing serious damage to our relationship, mine with my SIL and both of theirs with my fiance. I am to the point where I am so upset, saddened, and hurt, that I don't want either of them at my wedding.\n\nEDIT: my brother told us that since he and his wife so strongly believe that a marriage should only be occurring within the Catholic church and the church's rules, they can't be supporting us. I was so shocked by what he was saying that I wasn't ready to have a full fledged conversation about it, neither did I understand how I felt about it. I found out that he had told my parents that he was thinking about all of this, and they strongly recommended that he NOT go through with telling us this (they are also very religious but want to maintain a good relationship with myself and my fiance).\n\nWIBTA if I were to un-invite them to the wedding? I already feel incredibly hurt by the implications that they don't support my marriage, and I want my wedding day to be full of joy and be surrounded by people who truly support me and my soon-to-be husband.", "created_utc": 1699904848, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17uj1a3/wibta_if_i_uninvited_my_brother_and_sil_to_my/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I just hope you had a talk before fully uninviting them.", "I think you need to talk to your brother and get it straight from him why they want to take a less active role.

Otherwise you might sabotage a good relationship with your brother and SIL by mistake.", "NTA but I think you, your fiancee, brother and SIL need to sit down and talk first. I get the un-inviting them but I also know from experience this can do lasting damage. Before you do that see if you can fix it.", "NAH as of right now, but I think there is something else going on under the surface. It strikes me as odd that they\u2019d have you stand with them in their presumably overwhelmingly Catholic wedding but would be stepping back for religious or moral reasons. Perhaps they are dealing with something else that would keep them from focusing on your wedding. Definitely should have a deeper talk with them in my opinion", "its your wedding - you can choose not to invite people if you think it will make you uncomfortable to have them there so NTA. \n\nhave they outwardly objected to your marriage though? not having them in your wedding party is one thing but to uninvite them completely based on an assumption that they dont support it could be avoided if you were to have a conversation with them about their opinion.", "Your brother and SIL are religious bigots and I'm sorry for you.

That you want it to be a day of joy not a day of judgment.   The hypocrisy of these types makes me nuts.", "NTA and as a Catholic he is WRONG on so many levels.  Catholics can attend/witness/etc weddings of different faiths and non religious ones as well.  I have seen Priests attend secular and other religious wedding ceremonies. \nI am enough of a B that o would  call his parish priest and ask him about this \u201crule\u201d and then go from there and call out your brother and say \u201cFr so-n-so said that it was just fine to be there and there is no problem\u201d so what is the REAL reason you and SIL don\u2019t want to celebrate my marriage?", "NTA. They don't support you or the wedding.  They would do nothing but bring down the vibe.

You do not want judgemental jerks there.", "If you uninvite them, make sure they are fully aware of the reasoning behind it: they're being stupid and crazy.", "While understandable (NTA), instead of resorting to these spiteful tit-for-tat acts, where the pair of you engage in small slights and slowly erode your relationship to the point of no return, I\u2019d suggest taking a deep breath and confronting your brother. Don\u2019t be aggressive, just lay all your cards on the table and try to get him to do the same, so you know where you both stand. Hopefully the pair of you can reach an understanding of sorts.", "NTA. Tell them to stay at home with all their judgment. You only want peaople who respect what the day is about to attend. You don't need them bringing the day down.", "Besides being strictly catholic are they into following social norms. Like not taking away from the bride on her wedding day. Is there a chance by the time your wedding happens she might be showing in areas, that are noticeable at the ceremony. Or due and may need to bolt, which would be kinda hard if she\u2019s in the bridal party.", "NAH\n\nThey have their beliefs and don't even want to attend. I don't think they'll mind being uninvited.\n\nAlso, your wedding = your party, your guestlist.", "I don't think anyone's TA in this situation, you have your beliefs and it's your wedding so you get to have the wedding you want, but they also have their beliefs and they just don't want to have an active role. It's not like they made a scene or tried to judge your wedding and they still want to be there for you even though they don't support it(at least that's what I got). My opinion is invite them just try not to talk about the wedding with them since they don't want to be involved anyway. If other than that you're okay with them it would be sad to ruin your relationship with them just for that. In the end of the day it matters if they're happy that you're happy and not because you did something according their beliefs.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's not devout, that's bigot.\n\nMy husband was raised Catholic, and he was the black sheep - the only one who was agnostic, the only one who - on the rare occasions we went to Church such as Weddings, Baptism, Funerals - never took communion because that's for people who believe. We did not get married Catholic. We told the family that we would feel like mocking their believes if we went through with something we did not believe in. There was never any fighting back, any criticism. Because, you know what, they're decent people.", "NAH but why such an extreme reaction over their preferred place in the wedding? They would rather be guests than bridesmaids/groomsmen and whether that\u2019s religious or some other reason, I think they have a right to that.

I never got any flak from any of my family and some are super religious. I\u2019m not really anymore either for what it\u2019s worth. More spiritual but your brother is out of line.

It seems sad that you cannot work this out though as not being able to do so will damage your relationship for ever with your brother. Your brother was raised as you were so it seems that it is your SILs opinion you are hearing now. As you were raised catholic could you discuss the churches view on your brother attending a non religious ceremony with the priest (with a very clear understanding that you do not wish to have any religious aspect to your wedding) as I honestly can\u2019t believe there would be any prohibition against this, which may help your brother stand up to his wife?

As for what to do, it's your wedding, you can do whatever you want. Like you mentioned it should only be about happiness and joy so if having your brother there will be a negative experience for you then you shouldn't invite him.
