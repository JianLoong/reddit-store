We've been meticulously planning our dream wedding, which is scheduled for later this year. It's been stressful, but we're both super excited.\n\nNow, onto the issue at hand. My younger sister \"Emily\" (24F) announced last week that she's pregnant. It was a surprise, but our family is supportive and we're all happy for her. The problem? Her due date is just a few days before my wedding.\n\nEmily asked me to move my wedding date so she could comfortably attend and enjoy the day. She fears she'll either be heavily pregnant or just have given birth around my wedding date. I was shocked by her request. We've booked the venue, sent out invites, arranged catering and everything else. Plus, our wedding date has a special significance to us\u2014it's the anniversary of when we first met.\n\nI refused and told Emily that while I understand her concern, it's not feasible to reschedule everything now. She didn't take it well and said that I'm being selfish, prioritizing my wedding over her first child. My parents are trying to stay neutral, but I can tell they're upset with the situation too.\n\nNow I'm getting the cold shoulder from Emily and some passive-aggressive comments from my relatives. I'm feeling guilty and second-guessing my decision, but also feel like I'm being asked to give up a lot here.\n\nSo, AITA for not changing my wedding date for my sister's pregnancy?\n\nTL;DR: My sister announced her pregnancy and her due date is near my already planned wedding. She asked me to change the date, I refused. Now I'm being labeled as selfish.

You have a lot invested in the day already, and it would probably be extremely expensive and definitely a major nuisance to cancel and rebook everything once you have it arranged.

You can be pregnant and still attend a wedding NTA", "NTA. Rescheduling a wedding is a LOT of work and you'll likely lose out on most of what you have already paid. A lot of vendors have clauses in their contracts as far as cancelation and rescheduling goes that get stricter as the deadline gets closer. Venues also book up very quickly so if you were to want to reschedule it could mean losing out of the venue completely or being stuck on a whatever they have available date. I get that she wants to be at your wedding and that's very sweet, but her expecting you to change everything on a moments notice is absurd at best.", "NTA. Emily gets to learn fast that when you have kids, you can\u2019t always do everything you want to anymore because you gotta put the kids first and sacrifices have to be made sometimes. \n\n\nI\u2019m in the same boat, I found out I was pregnant and my due date is the day before my best friends wedding, and the week after my cousins out of town wedding. It never even came to my mind \u201coh I should ask them to move their dates to accommodate me!\u201d No, I just informed them I wouldn\u2019t be able to attend anymore and sent a wedding gift. \n\n\nCongratulations on your upcoming wedding OP!

My SIL is getting married 6 days after my due date in another state, so I of course won\u2019t be able to make it. I never once thought about asking her to change her date! How ridiculous that would be. I\u2019m disappointed I won\u2019t make it, she\u2019s disappointed she won\u2019t have the time to fly out to meet the baby, but we both support what the other has going on.  Family should support each other, not cause problems for each other. Heck, I\u2019m even insisting my husband fly out for the wedding as long as I\u2019m not still in the hospital. \nYour sister\u2019s desire to enjoy your wedding doesn\u2019t trump that it is YOUR wedding. She should feel fortunate if she\u2019s able to make any part of it and keep her mouth shut on anything else.", "NTA\u2026What is being asked is 100% unrealistic.  \nI can\u2019t believe your family is even entertaining this kind of foolishness.", "What is it with people and weddings? I don't want to get married (only for legal reasons) because it just seems like it is 0% fun.\n\nEveryone turns into an asshole and everyone hates each other. What is wrong with people?\n\nNTA.

Other businesses and guests will have scheduled orders and other commitments around your date that was provided to them well in advance for exactly that reason, because there is lots to do, and all it takes is one supplier to say they can't and you lose a deposit and have to find someone new to fulfil a request that usually gets booked up over a year in advance. It will be a shame if she can't make it, but these things happen.", "Do people not understand how hard it is to coordinate god knows how many different people to show up and do their jobs in conjunction with everyone whilst on a deadline? And now they want you to spend even more money moving everything around whilst also losing the venue you had picked out months ahead?

She started having contractions but didn't leave right away because she had been looking forward to the waffles and was determined to get them! After eating she went to the hospital but that was a surreal thing for me. But at the time I didn't have much experience with pregnancy, now I totally get refusing to let anything get between you and your cravings!", "Plus, live streaming is a thing. If she has the baby right before the wedding, she can do that from home if she's still too sore/exhausted to go afterward. \n\nIf anything what COULD be done for her (but ONLY if you're cool with the idea) is to do a couple of wedding pics with her either before or after the wedding/honeymoon. That way, she's still included in some way. Hell, you can have the wedding/reception recorded and give her copy if she's unable to go. (My parents did that for theirs. It's the only way for us to  see our maternal grandma when she was alive outside of pictures.) \n\nBut that past paragraph was just ideas that can help solve the issue. I hope that wasn't offensive on my part. And whatever you decide is the right choice bc this is both fianc\u00e9's and your day. You two are the only ones who can decide what goes on that day.

Tell them you're will to consider it if they can cover those costs, because without that, you can't have your wedding on a different date. \n\nWhen they refuse to pay, tell them the wedding is preceeding as planned. If anyone else says anything, give them that same number, tell them it's the amount you'd lose to move the wedding and only if they are willing to cover it, are you even willing to consider it.", "Would you blame your family if they didn't attend bc your sister was having/just had the baby?", "I want to emphasize that it\u2019s more than the money", "I would love to say that I wouldn\u2019t but I\u2019m sure I would feel sad about it. I would be sad if it happens during my wedding too. But I don\u2019t expect them to put me above her or vice versa because I think both situations are equally important. Best case scenario is some way for them to be there to some extent for each", "Sometimes its only when people are faced with the actual dollars of changing an event like a wedding that they can comprehend the enormity of what they are asking.  Plus with rescheduling you also have risks of the people you have organised then not being available on the new date.... Using actual numbers alongside the emotional reasons makes things much more real. \n\nI'd hate to think how much it would be for me to change mine - only 3 months out atm", "We here understand apparently your family doesn't. But the sum of money lost might actually get them thinking NTA"]}
