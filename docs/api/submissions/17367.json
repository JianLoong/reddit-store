I would be challenging people to explain how exactly the expected you to do it. I'm sorry, I hope they see sense soon", "NTA. But your sister sounds selfish and bratty. Tell her to plan better next time. Don\u2019t schedule big events so close to one another. You won\u2019t sound any more unreasonable than she did with her BS request.", "OP isn't the only one that's been planning - if invitations have gone out then guests have already taken time off of work and booked plane tickets and hotels - the average wedding size is what, 200 people these days?  You can't ask 200 people to reschedule plans - that is wildly rude.", "Or, if and when sister gets engaged, presumably to the father of her impending baby, how about OP and her by-then husband get pregnant about eight-nine months before the tentative wedding date THEN ask sister to move the date of her wedding?", "How can you ask OP to try and make her sister comfortable to save her relationship? \nSiblings act entitled sometimes and they are dead wrong. But it is little act of love which keeps the relationship going. OP is obviously NTA and her sister is being one for pressuring her. But i would suggest OP to try and deescalate the situation to help her sister.", "She can absolutely enjoy the experience fully at 9 months pregnant! Being 9 months pregnant isn't a near death experience. I've been 9 months pregnant 3 times and I did all sorts of fun things! Went to a wedding, went to the beach, attended parties. The only thing she can't do is get trashed.", "You usually can\u2019t eat while in labour, so she was smart to get some food while she could!", "Because if it were my brother that had something I would do everything possible to include him!", "NTA. This is the answer. Add up the number, then add tax. You\u2019ve spent months planning which means there has been a significant amount of time invested as well as money."]}
