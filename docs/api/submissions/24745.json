Why should you have to pay for her free vacation?  \n\nThe trip should be split 6 ways, and boyfriend can pick up her portion if he wants.  He wants to be a baby and drop out, that\u2019s on him. \n\nAlso I\u2019m sorry your boys trip just had its entire dynamic changed like that. I remember trips with my guy friends, and then once girlfriends started joining over time the dynamic changed and the trips just weren\u2019t what they once were.", "NTA, wtf why would he expect you to pay for his girlfriend? All the costs should be split equally since it was previously agreed that its the most fair option. If he doesn't want her to pay, he should pay for her.", "The bombshell dropping friend needs to pay for her, if he wants her to go so badly.", "NTA, this is an absolutely fair stance. It's 2023, she can pay for her costs and if your friend really doesn't like that, he can cover her share instead. It's not fair to ask you guys to subsidize her trip. Does she even know he's doing this? I'd be so embarrassed if I found out my significant other was asking other people to cover my share.", "NTA - She is not a guest, she is a participant. \n\nMAYBE they share the cost of 1/5 of the Air BnB (assuming he was going to have his own and now she is staying in that room with him), but everything else (gas, food, etc.) should be split 6 ways. If he wants to treat her as HIS guest, he can pay 2/6 instead of 1/5. But the rest of you are not obligated to help him cover her expenses.", "NTA\n\nShe's his guest, not yours. If he thinks she shouldn't pay because of some weird guest status, then he should be the one footing the bill.", "NTA, so essentially your friend wants you to foot the bill for his girlfriend. That's not cool.\n\nEdit spelling", "NTA. No, you are not unreasonable for not wanting to subsidize his GF's vacation.  Why should you?  If your friend has a problem with it, then he should cover her share himself--he's the one that invited her.   Besides, one girl on a guy's trip?  Your friend is either going to spend all of his time with the gf or it is going to get really awkward at times.", "NTA.\n\nThe act of her joining last minute shouldn't entitle her to benefit from everyone else paying. One of the major benefits of travelling together like this is splitting costs. It's a shared trip, you share the costs equally. Otherwise you're all collectively paying for his GF to get a free trip.\n\nWith how much advance warning does your friend think it would have been fair for her to chip in? A month before? 2 months before? There's no clear answer to it, which I think is a fair indicator that she should contribute.", "NTA. That's how joining travel works. You pay your part the expenses of a shared trip.", "There\u2019s no earthly reason why you should suck it up and cover her share \u201cbecause she is his guest.\u201d It\u2019s absurd on its face. Because she is his guest, he can cover her share. She\u2019s not all-of-yous\u2019 guest. Just his. Why should you all chip in to cover her? It remains a mystery. I have no advice for handling it diplomatically, as your friend appears to be an irrational asshole. You are NTA.", "NTA if he wants her to come there really are two options, she pays her way or he does.

Just curious how the other partners would/do feel about her joining but not them?\n\nShe should pay a share or he should pay for her. If he wants to back out, so be it. If this was one of your significant others, would he be fine with them not splitting?", "NTA. Everyone chips in their share for food and transportation. However if she shares a room at the air bnb then you probably shouldn\u2019t charge her extra for that since two ppl will be in one room.", "NTA - costs should be divided by 6 and everyone pays their own way.

Your friend sucks and you should honestly take him up on his offer to not come. It's going to be a weird (and shitty) dynamic with his gf there, whether she pays or not.\n\nThe reason you also suck is because you're not standing up for yourself and your other friends who aren't bringing their girlfriends. If she comes along you're going to realize why this isn't a NTA situation.", "If the trip has already been paid for, then I'd let it go.  Yes, she should pay her way, but I wouldn't choose this hill to die on.  He paid his way, she is the guest, let her vo.e along and everyone have fun.  One never knows...she may chip in on the trip in some other ways.", "This is tricky. If gas and airbnb are going to be the same I'd say leave it as thr 5 way split or HE pays for her part. But she should definitely be covering her other expenses such as food, any type if activity costs etc. He likely told her she wouldn't need to pay anything and that's why she agreed to come. Either way a lads trip is a lads trip and it seems shitty to bring your GF without it being in the original plans.", "Honestly? ESH. \n\nBoth yall and your friend are assholes for making such a big deal about this. You were already fine with paying your shares and she's not adding any extra costs.

I suppose if they go to a restaurant the others should all chip in and cover her meal too? This way of thinking really puzzles me.

Simply the fact that there is a person on a different relationship level will change the dynamic, and no one ever said it was a bad thing, it simply will because of the addition.
