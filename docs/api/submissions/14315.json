{"id": 14315, "submission_id": "12fvxi7", "title": "AITA for not telling my boyfriend about a lottery win?", "selftext": "Throwaway for obvious reasons\n\nAlso, English is my third language and I feel kind of flustered right now so sorry for any mistakes.\n\nI (21 F) recently won the local lottery. And yes, I don't want to say an exact number, but it's a lot of money, I only play occasionally so I couldn't believe it either. My (ex?)boyfriend (26) and I had been together for a 2 years, but we never really talked about finances yet. We live separately and would split most dates and trips and the few other shared expenses we had equally.\n\nSo when I won the lottery, as I said I couldn't really believe it. However, as the initial euphoria wore off, I started to worry about how the money might affect my relationship. I didn't want my boyfriend to start treating me differently because of the money. And although I love him, lately we have been having some problems, and I didn't want his view of me to change only because the money I have now.\n\nSo, I made the decision to keep it a secret (well, at least unti we figure our issues out, or maybe forever). I felt bad, like I was lying to my boyfriend, but I also didn't want him to know about the money at least until I was sure that our relationship was solid.\n\nUnfortunately my boyfriend found out about the money when he saw some paperwork from the lottery in one of my drawers. He said he was looking for a pen because he needed to write something down. Usually, when he comes to my place, he never enters the small office area I have so that was a bit weird. Anyways, after he found out he was furious with me and accused me of lying to him. He said that I should have been honest with him from the beginning and that my decision to keep the money a secret was a betrayal of his trust. Or something along those lines, with a few less nice words mixed in.\n\nI tried to explain my reasoning, but he didn't want to hear it. He was convinced that I was only interested in the money and that our relationship meant nothing to me, and that's why I have been more distant towards him lately. (Although most of our relationship problems prior to the money issues are due to him, and even he acknowledged that in the past...) He even suggested that I give him a large portion of the money as a way of making amends. Then he stormed out of my apartment, saying that he needed to cool down and think our relationship over, and that he expects an apology from me and that thinks need to change.\n\nI understand why  he is is upset with me. But on the other hand, I feel like he's being unfair, especially for trying to put the blame on me for the issues we've been having in our relationship. I didn't want to lie to him, but I also didn't want the money to come between us, at least until we solve them.\n\n**So update I guess?**\n\nLast night I put my phone on do not disturb and went to sleep. I woke up to several missed calls and texts from him. Saying that he reacted badly, that he doesn't want any money, that he's just been stressed about his job and car, and stuff like that. Also, that it broke his heart that I still don't trust him again after what he did, although I said that I was starting to. I haven't replied or called him back yet though. \n\nAlso, about him having a suspicion about the win and going snooping, I think that's unlikely. In my country lottery winners can choose to be anonymous, and most people who win a lot of money always take this chance. I don't think he had any inkling of it, and I haven't really made any big purchases yet either that could make him suspicious.

You were 100% correct about his change in behavior after the money. The suggestion that you give him some kind of settlement to make up for not telling him about the money is, frankly, laughable. If you don\u2019t share expenses and accounts, he has no reason or right to demand information on your financial status.

You are in a great position now go live your life without him dragging you down", "Run, fast.\n\nObviously he now has had time to think it true and he has come up with ways to milk you for money.\n\nHe realises he must have came across as a di#k by asking for a a portion of the money and your to smart to just give it to him.\n\nSo now he tries to be all nice and apologetic to get money in long term, complaints about work- hopes you will say, well quit  and look for something better ( while you finance him and he moves in and lives on your expense, never actually finding new job)\n\nHis car issues? Another cheep way to milk you for money, well you have spare money - buy me new car\u2026 etc etc\n\nRun, this will not end well for you.\nHe is money grabbing w#nk\n\nAlso going true your desk/office area\u2026 already huge red flag!\n\nProtect yourself and your money, run from this person.", "First rule of lottery winnings- Tell no one.\n\nSecond rule of lottery winnings- Refer to rule number 1.\n\nThese aren\u2019t official rules, but they\u2019re what I\u2019ve always went by every time I get a lottery ticket of any kind. You never, ever know what someone -even a trusted friend or family member- may ask you for. Your boyfriend is now demanding monetary compensation for a secret that you kept for a reason? It sounds shady to me.", "You know the right answer is to break up with him \ud83d\udc9b.", "Even with the update, I'd be sceptical about him after the 'give me some of your money'. \nYou've said you need to repay him for a loan? Do so and give him nothing more. Get some proper financial assistance (or at least put the money into a savings account.) Don't tell anyone else. \nNTA. Also your English is wonderful.", "Red flags on this.  Please don't give him any money.  In spite of what he's now saying,  and his apology,  I feel he's already shown you who he is when he asked you for money and couldn't understand why you might have kept your win quiet.", "Firstly, why is he snooping at your house?\n\nAlso, he is manipulative and cares more about the money than the relationship with you.\n\nLeave his sorry ass and mail his stuff back to him.", "NTA he has acted EXACTLY like you expected he would. He seems like he\u2019s projecting when he accuses you of only caring about the money.", "NTA\n\nHis emotional reaction should have been this, and in this order:\n\n1 - Happiness for you, at your win. A big thing like this is incredible, and if sufficiently big can be life changing.\n\n2 - Concern and upset AT HIMSELF that you didn\u2019t feel you could talk to him about it. That shouldn\u2019t be a you problem, that is all on him, and he should have been asking what he could do to help fix that.\n\nThat he only reached stage 2, and only after thinking about it for a couple of days, speaks loud and clear. You can\u2019t be certain that his remorse is genuine, or coming from the right place.\n\nIf it is a life changing win, cut him loose.", "You don\u2019t share finances. Your gut instincts were right to not tell him. He was clearly expecting you to just take care of his money problems and then some. By demanding a huge portion of the money, he was showing you his true colors. \n\nStay far away from this greedy creep and enjoy your winnings. NTA", "Possibly unpopular but... NTA currently YWBTA if you keep dating him. I don't think your bf is entitled to the money but if after two years together you don't trust him enough to disclose it, you don't have anything there to save", "NTA. You know how it goes. That\u2019s why you called him a boyfriend not fianc\u00e9 or husband.", "Run. Don't walk. Find someone who loves you for you", "NTA. You're not married, you don't share anything, and you don't live together. Sure, i'd feel a little betrayed but because i know my partner, it wasn't out of malice but safety. It's when he suggests a lump sum as an apology that i don't have remorse. Money changes a lot of people...keep that in mind and secure your finances.", "Agree\n\nHe will try and walk that comment back.. He'll try and apologize profusely to say he's stressed / angry / upset at something else.. that he loves OP and never meant what he said...\n\nBut sadly he's shown what's important to him through this comment alone. (Money)\n\nHe'll want to stay on the basis of money = good times / free ride.\n\nHe's already attempted to twist blame on OP.. manipulative and cruel.\n\n@OP .. you're gonna feel like you're in a tough position.. lOCk that money to avoid others attempting to manipulate you into sharing.. Get official financial advice and invest wisely.. do NOT be persuaded by sob stories from anyone (INCLUDING family).. grief and sudden money does very strange things to people and morality can fly out the window...
