He works 7am-4pm and I stay home to take care of her, when he gets home we split chores and taking care of the baby roughly 50/50. I always take the night shift for taking care of the baby (who has never been a good sleeper by ANY means) so that he can have a full nights rest for his day at work. \n\nLast night, he asked if i would be okay with him going out to grab drinks after work with his coworkers. He said it wouldn\u2019t take more than an hour, and that he\u2019d be home at 5:30. I agreed - I think it\u2019s important for both of us to spend time outside the house - but also i knew he wouldn\u2019t be done that fast. Still, he assured me he would be home in time for her bedtime (8 pm) as he usually does her bedtime routine with her so that I can unwind a little before I put her to sleep and spend the rest of the night waking up every 3ish hours (yay sleep regression). \n\nI had no problem with him staying out late in general, I just wanted to have a realistic idea of how long it would take so that I could mentally prep myself and not count on his help if he wouldn\u2019t make it. All I asked is that he keeps me posted. \n\n5:30 rolls around and I still had not heard from him. I didn\u2019t want to bother him during his time off, so i refrained from texting or checking in. Then 6:30. At 6:45 I texted him \u201chello\u201d with no answer. At 7:30 \u201care you okay\u201d. At 8 I said \u201can update would\u2019ve been nice\u201d and put my phone away to get our baby ready for bed. \n\nHusband comes home at 8:30, confused why i\u2019m upset. I was touched out, strung out, exhausted, barely eaten. All i wanted was a text, and I couldn\u2019t even get that. He then proceeds to compare me to the other wives of his coworkers who did not bother them the entire night. That was my breaking point - I yelled at him and told him that if he likes the wives of his coworkers so much then maybe he should go live with them instead. \nAITA?\n\nEDIT I just want to make clear I wasn\u2019t upset at him for going out. I encourage him to spend time outside the house - and would even be okay with him being home late. I was upset because he essentially ghosted me for hours after the time he ASSURED me he would be home, then started comparing me to other women.

You have a six-month-old. It's shitty that he tried to deflect and compare you to the wives of others. Do any of them even have an infant?", "NTA.\n\nHis coworkers' wives probably don't have a 6 month old at home and if they do I feel sorry for them having husbands like that.", "Touched out is a legitimate thing. Do any of his coworkers have a 6 month old baby at home? I think you escalated, but he dropped the ball on ensuring your were ok and he was meeting agreed upon family needs.", "NTA. Babies are horribly hard in those first few months. Harder than full time work. He should have been more respectful. And comparing you to other mums is a MASSIVE no no. Poor form.", "NTA.  Going out for happy hour is one thing.  Going out for happy hourS is something very different, especially when he said he'd be home at 5:30.", " NTA\n\nHe gave you a time that he planned to be home and he failed to send a simple text that he\u2019d be late. You may have escalated it a bit but being a touched out, sleep deprived mom of an infant I think you get a pass on this one.", "NTA.\n\nHe absolutely should have taken the initiative to at least message you. He also should have apologized for being late and you having to cover his usual task for him without prior planning.\n\nNormally I wouldn\u2019t condone yelling at him, but you\u2019re likely exhausted so it\u2019s understandable", "Husband is TAH because of the refusal of communication. All he had to do was just answer your text. It's not like you were demanding him to come home with your messages either, just a status report. He also doesn't get to compare you to the other wives if you're the only couple with a literal baby at home.", "NTA. \nHe knew to be home early. He either lied to you, or simply didn\u2019t care that he broke the promise he made.", "NtA he acted like an irresponsible ass. You don't need two children", "NTA. I don\u2019t even have a kid and I\u2019ve gotten mad at my husband for going out, saying he would be back within like 4-5 hours, and then him simply not responding to texts. It\u2019s just courtesy - if you\u2019re going out later, say something. I don\u2019t care if you go out, just be responsive, one text explaining you\u2019re out later is fine. \n\nHowever, if I had a kid and he did that I would be pretty irritated.", "NTA.    I don\u2019t even have kids and it winds me up when husband stays out considerably later than he\u2019s said he\u2019s going to be.    I don\u2019t mind him being out late, so long as he gives me a realistic expectation of when he will be home so I can plan around him.    It\u2019s the \u201cI\u2019ll home by 6\u201d so I plan our dinner or something for when he gets home and get left waiting for him until closing time that annoys me: if he\u2019d just SAY it\u2019s going to be a late one I can sort myself out and not bother waiting for him.    It\u2019s a respect thing", "NTA. He didn't do the bare minimum.", "NTA, and for the record you have a full day of work after a sleepless night too. It\u2019s just that yours isn\u2019t paid or recognized in the same way.", "I think the stakes of this argument are about whether you are both equally responsible for the baby after work hours, or whether he is allowed to be free of the baby until he decides to come home, while you are always tied to the baby by default, unless he magnanimously offers to \"help\" you. He agreed he'd come home at 5:30. Maybe that wasn't enough time to hang out, and I would say it's unrealistic to think he'll be able to have a nice time in just one hour of \"Happy Hour.\" But he should have texted and let you know he wanted to stay out longer and checked with you that you were going to be able to manage. \n\nYour baby is 6 months old so do I think it's ok for him to start getting out and socialize sometimes, and you also. You should be coming out of the newborn haze, although it will be gradual, not instantaneous. But it should be equal, not just him. I would probably expect that in future, if he's going to a work happy hour, it's going to be 3 hr or more, just thinking realistically. But the frequency should also be realistic and he should not act as if coming home on time is some magnanimous (and optional) thing he does. It's an expectation, because the baby was not solely your creation and is not solely your responsibility. \n\nComparing you to other women is not ok. It's a form of bullying, essentially he discussed the situation with his buddies and they are all ganging up against you to say that you are the only woman who is not ok with this, singling you out of the pack as the one person who is \"wrong\" while they are all \"correct.\" It's also gaslighting. First of all, the other men's wives are not in the same situation as you. Second, I doubt they polled their wives about you while they were out. And third, their sample is small and biased!!! Worst sample ever. Realistically, polling a neutral sample of experienced moms, most would not be ok with this, at least in this century.", "So thoroughly NTA", "Info:\nBreaks are good and needed when there\u2019s a young baby in the house.  I think we can express our frustration without resorting to angry shouting.  \n\nHis reaction was left out\u2026 what did he say? How did he react to your yelling?\n\nDid he profusely apologize?\n\nDid he give some lame ass excuse for not responding to you?\n\nDid he just pass you by and go to bed?  \n\nI have a lot of thoughts here, but I wanna be sure they are directed appropriately, based on his reaction.", "NTA all he needed to do was communicate and actually give you a realistic time. I have a 6 month old and would be upset if my partner didn\u2019t give me an update. It takes two seconds to send a text. He should have never compared you to anyone\u2019s wife either, that\u2019s just so rude ://", "NTA \nHusband is TA for staying out later then agreed, then pretending not to know what was wrong, then making a shitty comment and then doubling down and not apologizing. Also TA for not looking at his phone all night. Aside from being late, wouldn\u2019t you expect a new parent to make sure they\u2019re reachable?\n\nThe conversation about when he would be back does sound a little unclear though. First he said 5:30. You mentioned you already assumed and wouldn\u2019t mind it running later than that. Did you say this to him? Because then he assures you he\u2019ll be home in time for bedtime at 8. Why would he say this if 5:30 is still the plan? \nBut you started texting at 5:30, still expecting him at that time. \nHe\u2019s still the asshole, he was obviously even late if he assumed 8 o\u2019clock. Just wondering if communication could have been a bit clearer at that point.", "Nta. He should have texted. He could have been in a Ditch somewhere. \n\nI got worried the other day, my husband went to have a drink with a coworker. Called me to say he was following his friend home but not stopping because it is on the way. I was doing dishes and realized an hour passed(should have been 20 minutes) I got scared.  I called him and he was fine, they stopped somewhere else which is ok he just didn't tell me.  He was home 5 minutes later.", "NTA. He needs better communication. Honestly, he may have had his phone off. Not making excuses, just an observation.", "Wtf are people talking about? The husband's working 9 hour days and is helping out around the house and with the baby. He's definitely not just doing the bare minimum. \n\nOp, I get that you're upset because he didn't communicate that he would be later than he originally thought. But both of you deserve little breaks like that every now and then. Hopefully, you can take a few hours for yourself sometime soon too. \n\nAlso, not to belittle how you're feeling, but he wasn't out all night or come home drunk as a skunk.", "NTA. He assured you he\u2019d be home at 5:30 then didn\u2019t bother to communicate after that and came home 3 hours late. Comparing you to his coworkers wives was stupid, he doesn\u2019t know if his coworkers did the same thing he did and kept their phones off or just ignored their wives altogether, if their wives waited until they got home to chew them out or if his coworkers were smart enough to communicate they\u2019d be staying out later before or during the outing.", "NTH and the only reason I say that is because of the comment he made about the other wives. I'd say getting home 30 mins later wasn't the worst thing, and missing texts can happen in the moment, but once he saw you were upset , and especially knowing you had a baby all day, that comment is pure stupidity. I have a 14 month old at home so that stage is fresh in my mind and I know how hard it can be especially with a difficult baby. \n\nHang in there, you got this! It only gets worse once they can walk :D", "NAH. He asked if he could go out and said it would take an hour. You then say he reassured you he would be home by her bedtime at 8 therefore telling you it might overrun. He got in at half 8, did he explain why? Was there traffic or some other issue?\n\nHe\u2019s working, coming home and taking care of the child and doing the chores roughly 50/50. He needs a deserved break and has had it. Hopefully he will repay the favour back to you so you can go out with your friends sometime.\n\nThe communication wasn\u2019t the best, but we all know what happens at the pub. He doesn\u2019t want to be laughed at probably by his mates for being whipped and having to check the time and text you. No excuse but it happens.", "NTA, but he works so you CAN stay home with the baby. Relationships are tough and require a lot of work. A six month old complicates things! Sounds like he shares significantly in parenting so a little slack might be in order!", "You are NTA for being irritated and hurt, but Y may well be TA for snapping and yelling at him about it. Lack of communication like this is annoying, but it's not the worst thing a person ever did in a relationship, especially if it's not a recurring thing. By your account, your husband works hard and helps you with parenting when he is not at work; just as you work hard at being a stay-at-home parent. He's not self-evidently an AH either; it's reasonable to infer that you can continue to work well together. Yelling at him and making him feel bad about himself won't help with that goal. \n\nAs with so many of these things, who's right in the abstract matters less than what you want to happen next. No amount of you-being-right will mend the damage to a relationship done by callousness (on his part) or harshness (on yours). If you want to be happy and continue to work together to maintain your family, you need to talk to him. Apologize for yelling and insulting him; tell him that you felt neglected and ignored and hurt by his lack of contact; assure him that you don't want to discourage him from being with his friends; and ask him to support you by communicating better. Don't make it all about being right - tell him what you need from him and ask him what he needs from you. This is the way.", "YTA\n\nI understand your tired and need a break. I know taking care of babies is not easy but let\u2019s go over what you have said.\n\n1. Husband works full time. \n\n2. Husband does 50/50 on all household chores and child rearing when home.\n\n3. Husband in advanced asked if he could go out with coworkers which could also include his boss. \n\n4. Husband stated he would ideally like to be home by 5 which how would going out work if his end of day is 4 and then he has to travel home. Based on where he works in relation to where you live and having to sober up would be way too quick.\n\n5. He warned you that it might run late and hopefully be home by bedtime at 8. \n\n6. You agreed to this information above.\n\n7. At 5:30 you immediately began typing every half hour demanding a reply.  Despite him telling you it could run till 8 and you agreed to that time.\n\n8. He arrived home at 8:30 a half hour later than when he told you the latest he would be home.\n\n9. You scream at him the minute he gets home. Without talking to him to find out why he was a half hour late.\n\n\nCould he of sent a reply to you yes. However 7:00 is when you could of sent the first text to touch base.  If he didn\u2019t answer in the first hour of that sure annoyance is slightly valid. If he came home at Midnight smelling like a liquor store then you can be angry.\n\nYou aren\u2019t a babysitter waiting for parents coming home where you do need to know when the exact time your duties end. You are the parent and he had one night away and still made it home 30 minutes later then he said he would.", "YTA The \u201chello?\u201d text is passive aggressive as hell. You set the tone with that text and you did it an hour and a half before you expected him home. Going out for a couple drinks after work should not be a problem, but you made it clear to him with that text that it was. He didnt text you back because he knew an argument was coming, and chose to enjoy his time out rather than arguing. There is a fundamental communication problem somewhere. Every time you communicated with him it was in a passive aggressive way, and since you are the one telling the story I can only assume you are portraying your side favorably. It might have been a little shitty what he did, but by no means makes him an asshole. The way you talk about your communications, and the way you come to reddit for validation tell me YTA. Gut instinct though", "you're NTA\n\nbut neither is he.", "Nta but why did you start calling at 5:30? You knew that he wouldn't finish in an hour and he promised to be back at 8 before bedtime... Which is the time he arrived at (kinda). I would have started contacting him just then (at 8). Were you expecting that he tells you \"at the  bar\" \" still at the bar\" or smth? I don't get it. Seems like a bit much.", "Yes", "Yes... yelling should be a no-no, and in its place, with open clear communication, you can still convey the fact that you're upset / unhappy about a thing without the unnecessary shouting.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The kiddos need a LOT of physical interaction to be safe and healthy, but the parent, especially the primary parent, can feel like their body isn\u2019t their own if they don\u2019t get a break from the holding and the cuddling and the changing and the playing.", "\"touched out\" explains the \"overwhelming discomfort from receiving physical touch after being immersed in physical touch all day.\" \"(It's) a feeling that if one more person touches you, you will crawl out of your skin\u201d (https://www.today.com/today/amp/rcna105047)\n\nbasically i\u2019ve had a 6 month old clinging to me non stop since like three in the morning with absolutely no breaks, and negative sleep. sometimes I just need a minute to feel like a person lol", "That's your experience and I'm glad it was so pleasant- many of us never experienced that and have very full on babies that will not go in bouncers and do not sleep much since day1\nMany babies are not content in containers until they're older and will cry and cry unless held. I'm in month 10 and only starting to get some downtime now", "I have two of my own kids and nine nephews.. while having helped raise a few cousins... This has NEVER been my experience. Not once. I didn't get a full contact break until my daughter was three. No kid I've ever met has been content with swings and bouncers and it's also developmentally bad for kids to not have a LOT of interaction during the day. So, no, OP is absolutely valid and six months is one of the most developmentally difficult stages of the first year.\n\nOP, NTA. He said five thirty and even if you had the grace to say anything before eight is fine, he should have been on time. Babies are hard!", "No. I'm happy for you that that is your experience but no.", "My baby napped 20 mins at a time. The first six months were not relaxing.", "The baby\u2019s bedtime routine is *his* responsibility, so yes, it\u2019s a big deal.", "The original agreement was 5:30. That's why she texted him. And then he ignored her two more times, and missed bedtime routine. So no, he was 3 hours late, dropped the ball on communicating, and then had the audacity to compare her to his currently childless friends' wives.", "Oh man.  Not even an ounce of resentment.  F**k that hurts.\n\nMomma, I tell you, if my wife dodged a kiss from me, we\u2019d be having words.   Mostly from my mouth as an apology.\n\nThere\u2019s a reasonable expectation to be in contact with the person you A. Are married to and B. Who you have a F*****g child with.\n\nNTA.  And he\u2019s either shopping, cheating, or just a huge narcissist/AH.", "This is just ridiculous. That man is paying all the bills, helping with the housework, and with their child. OP even said it was 50/50.\n\nGod forbid he get to spend some time with friends. And on top of it all, he was home before 9.", "What she said is confusing but at the end she says \"still he assured me he would be home by her bedtime (8 pm) so I used that.", "yes, but the difference is whenever I go out it is after the baby\u2019s bed time when I\u2019ve already put her down for the night so that my husband can go to sleep on time as well to get a full night of sleep for work. he rarely takes care of her on his own when I\u2019m gone.", "This! I\u2019m seeing so many people bring up the fact that he\u2019s \u2018the provider\u2019 when that is completely irrelevant to this issue. He missed set deadlines, and didn\u2019t communicate a thing to his wife, that\u2019s the problem here. I\u2019m sure that if he had just messaged to say \u201chey, we\u2019re going to (insert place) do you mind if I stay out a little bit later?\u201d I\u2019m sure OP would have been fine with it. It\u2019s the fact that he said nothing.", "Agreed - the baby is actually not even that relevant.  He said he\u2019d be home by a certain time and came home 3 hours later without so much as a quick text.  This would be inconsiderate even if they didn\u2019t have a child.", "\"but also i knew he wouldn\u2019t be done that fast. Still, he assured me he would be home in time for her bedtime (8 pm)\"\n\nOP knew he wasn't going to be home by 5:30 and the total time he \"didn't respond\" was less than 2 hours, I can easily go 2 hours without looking at my phone especially if I'm at the pub with my friends. \n\nIf you want to crucify him for being thirty mins late for bedtime I guess you could but that seems a little harsh lol.", "I mean that sounds about right, probably finally looked at his phone and saw it just at 8 or right before. he had to get the bill and get to his car then drive home. I can easily go 2 hours without looking at my phone especially if I'm at the pub with my friends. \n\n\"but also i knew he wouldn\u2019t be done that fast.

Not a request for information why are you surprised you didn\u2019t get the information you didn\u2019t ask for? \n\nTexting generally omits tone etc so in general it\u2019s better to actually put what you need without assuming the other party is going to mind read the rest of the message.", "OP you posted he said he\u2019d be home by 8.. why bother him at all? He came home at 8:30.. late but he possibly lost track of time.", "as a starfleet captain you should know that this issue is the second kind of matter\n\ndon't matter.", "He suggested 5:30 but 8 was agreed to. So he was only a half hour late that's not a big deal, certainly not as big of a deal as OP is making it out to be, traffic could easily cause the small delay. \n\nHe was out enjoying himself which kinda hard to do, if you have to sit text your partner the whole time.", "I remember this feeling all too well after nursing my kids 18 months and 22 months each. I would finally get the baby down for bed, sit on the couch and my cat would try to climb on me. I loved him so much (he passed at 17 years old) but holy shitttt I would scream \u201cget off me!\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re NTA. It\u2019s nothing to do with him going out or being late. This is all about communication and you being exhausted from constant child care and he ignored you. That\u2019s effing rude. And inconsiderate. Why is it so hard for some partners to do the simplest things that can avoid huge arguments?!", "She can a half hour by herself.", "> Still, he assured me he would be home in time for her bedtime (8 pm)\n\nProbably because their wives let them enjoy their time out instead of blowing up their phones insisting that he texts her the whole time.\n\nThe original suggestion was 5:30 the agreement was for 8.", "Shit.  That\u2019s not fair of me to say that.  I don\u2019t know your ages.  \n\nStill, you are NTA.   Talk to him again and let him know how that interaction made you feel.  If more of the same \u2026. Well, you gotta make that decision next time\n\nEdit for grammar.  It\u2019s getting late for me.", "I don\u2019t think him staying out was the issue, it was the lack of communication + the change in plans. He said he\u2019d be home earlier than that, and he wasn\u2019t. Point blank, that\u2019s an issue. If he wanted to stay out later, that was something that needed to be communicated with OP\n\nHe\u2019s a big boy, he can send a text to his wife saying he\u2019ll be out later. But besides that, he should send a text REGARDLESS of what happened. I mean, not even a hello back or a can\u2019t talk right now, just straight up blanked her. Regardless of the work he is putting in for his family, it doesn\u2019t excuse stupid actions, which this was.\n\nANYONES partner that went for drinks, didn\u2019t reply to messages and came home later than he initially said would be worried. I\u2019d be thinking he died or something considering everything.", "He was the hours late, didn't let her know and ignored her. \n\nI have higher standards. \n\nI'm glad op does too.", "OP takes care of 100% of childcare and whatnot when the husband is a work. When he is off they split things 50/50. That is a complete 50/50 split. They each do 100% of their job when apart and split it 50/50 when they are home.", "Too bad the baby\u2019s bedtime was 8.", "You need to change that. Make it the same hours he was out. Don't leave it so you're the only one. He can take care of a 6 month old. Or do it on a weekend.  Moms and dads both need breaks.", "he knew i\u2019d be okay with it, but he also knew how important it was to keep me updated if that was the case", "the \u201chello\u201d was in the context of our conversation via text right before that, when the last text I got from him was that he would keep me posted (which was when he left work at 4)", "he said 8 at the latest, and even that was after i told him i doubt he\u2019ll be done at 5:30 like he initially said. he promised to keep me posted - i would be okay with him staying later as long as i was updated fairly in terms of having to cover his shift with the baby which is essentially my only time to unwind and take a breath", "A quick text at 7:45 to alert OP that he would be late wouldn't have taken away from his night out. They have a six-month-old. He should be more communicative. It is really not that hard to send a text.", "It's not hard to spend 30 seconds replying to your partner.", "She was literally by herself all day with the baby. He dropped the ball and ignored her texts when all he had to do was give her an update. \n\nAnd then he compares her to the wives of his coworkers who do not have an infant to care for. \n\nHe was an ass", "If that's enough for you to throw away a marriage, I hope you stay single.", "Yes it would have he's trying to have a good time not be on his phone all night. The child was fine there was no need for him to text. She could have just backed off and let him have his one night out without blowing him up for nothing.", "It's even easier for your partner to just back off for a few hours and let you enjoy a night out uninterrupted.", "He was literally at work all day. She knew where he was, he shouldn't have to constantly check with her. There was no issues with the infant so there was no reason to be blowing him up. Having to text someone makes harder to relax and enjoy the few hours out.", "I didn't say I'd leave him. Lol. \n\nWe both have those standards and apologize if we make mistakes and try not to let each other DARVO like this guy did", "O! Stay single.  That's hilarious. \nI've been married 22 years.", "Sending one text is not being on your phone all night. Are you the husband?", "You are trying to argue that shooting his wife one text would have ruined his night? One text would have meant he had to be on his phone all night. Is that really your contention?", "Not an option when you have a six month old, and you told your partner you'd be home for their bed time.", "I kinda feel sorry for you.  You can't understand that if you care about someone,  you make that effort to respect them,  even if it's a 5 second text hey wife I'll be a bit late.  8 words.  Just tells me you've never really had someone you truly care about.  I'm sorry you're missing out on some of the best parts of being human.", "If you had just worked 17 hours straight with no breaks, your boss promised you would be done x time, and he would be there to relieve you. You had been counting on that all day. \n\nX time comes, and the boss is a no show, x time is gone and past. It's now been 17.5 hours, and finally, the boss comes in. You're pissed, but all boss says, \"pffft, you can handle 30 minutes.\"", "DARVO is something that is normally tied to abusers and I doubt that's the case.", "His comment history points more towards an incel or men\u2019s rights activist.\n\nMaybe he is just a bitter divorced guy though.", "She wanted texts all night. He should be able to enjoy the whole night without having to text at all.", "She was watching the clock the whole time, timing him. So yes it would have, he should have been able to just enjoy his night out without having worry about texting her.", "Actually it very well is, there was no problems with the kid so need to text or call. He was only half out late she might not have even done with the bedtime routine yet, and if was oh well. She could handle it for one night.", "No, I just don't report my every movement to anyone. \nMy partner knows this and that I'm going to be sitting there texting them if I'm having a night out, and likewise if they're out having a night with friends. \n\n\nShe could have respected him backed off for a few hours and let him enjoy a few hours out uninterrupted.", "No gender has nothing to do with it. Incels are whiney little virgins that blame others for them not being able to get relationships or get laid, I definitely don't fit the bill.\n\nI take it that your referring to the exchange I had about there being almost no resources for men are who victims of domestic violence. That should be considered a problem unless you're sexist and think they shouldn't have resources to help them in those situations. \nAlso where do I say what gender I am??", "How does her watching to clock impact him at all? Why is taking five seconds to send a text such a burden in your mind? He was late he didn't text when he was late. He has an infant. He needs to grow up.", "You used the term \u201clow value man\u201d in a comment. That is a dead giveaway that you follow the likes of Andrew Tate. Only red pill victims use that term. Either you are an incel and/ or a misogynist. \n\nI also see that you are against any services that are for women. Women-only shelters. Woman-only addiction support groups. Even a girl's night out seems to be objectionable to you. You do not seem to understand that historically disadvantaged groups often need separate spaces to feel safe. Having a men's only or women's only group or activity isn't inherently sexist. \n\nYour comment history has a very MRA feel to it. Not that any of this matters. You cry sexism a lot though. More than 95% of people from what I can gather.", "Because the point of the night out is to have fun blow off some steam not worry having to text her. \nHe was going to have to deal with her bitching either way so it's better just to keep the phone in his pocket enjoy the night, and deal with the other shit when he gets home. \n\nHe was only a half hour late the infant was fine. He didn't need to text when was running a little late she's not his warden he doesn't have to report all of his movements to her."]}
