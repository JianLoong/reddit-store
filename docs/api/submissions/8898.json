In our household, I do everything cooking related. I come up with recipes, do the grocery shopping, and cook. Boyfriend eats whatever I make and cleans up afterwards. I have been fine with this arrangement up until this point because 1. I like cooking and 2. I work from home and my job is not very demanding. He works 2 healthcare jobs and has an hour commute each way. Given that He is in healthcare, his schedule is not your typical 9-5--he works a lot of weekends and will sometimes have random weekdays off while I work.\n\nLately he has been extremely lazy on his days off. He used to clean the dishes immediately after we ate, but now he has been letting them sit for hours or even overnight while he sits on his phone or watching TV. He has also been slacking in other areas (I can't remember the last time he cleaned our shower, which is one of the other responsibilities he has). I understand that things are still crazy for healthcare workers, so I am trying to give him the benefit of the doubt. But today I reached my breaking point. We have dishes piling up in the sink and he has been sitting on the couch all day long doing absolutely nothing. I asked him after lunch when he planned on doing them, and he snapped at me saying he would get them done but needed a rest day. I am immensely frustrated with this, so I just made dinner for myself only. I didn't give him any warning, just didn't make a portion for him. I sat down and started eating, and he came into the room, our exchange went a little like this:\n\nBF \"Are you messing with me? Where is my dinner?\" Me: \"I didn't make anything for you tonight. You haven't been holding up your end of the household chores and I'm tired of slaving over all your meals while you spend the day on the couch when the house is a total mess. We have stuff for sandwiches or you can get some take out.\"\n\nMy boyfriend was LIVID. He screamed at me and stormed off to get something to eat out. He has been gone about an hour and hasn't returned. I feel kind of badly about it now because we didn't really have much discussion about things before I just blatantly cut him off. But I am tired of doing all the cooking work while he doesn't hold up his end of the bargain. AITA?\n\nETA To those of you suggesting my boyfriend may be depressed and I haven't been checking in on his mental health: I am *constantly* checking in on him to make sure he is ok. We are very open in discussing how things are at work and I have even told him that if it is too much for him to handle mentally he can quit one of his jobs and financially we will be ok. He doesn't want to, he is happy and loves what he does.", "created_utc": 1675289140, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10r7q0y/aita_for_not_warning_my_partner_i_had_stopped/", "score": 916, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's not going to likely want to recognize it because he doesn't want to admit there's anything wrong with him / the depression time blindness is in his eyes so hard that he doesn't recognize that he hasn't been pulling his load. \n\nThe fucky part of depression is you can love your job and you can love your life and you can still be depressed.

Not very mature.\n\nHow are the bills set up? Are they 50/50? If they are not 50/50, perhaps you doing more chores and cooking dinner makes sense, especially if he is working longer hours\n\nRegardless, mature conversations need to be had when you\u2019re both fed and had enough sleep.\n\nEdit: added part about the extra hours", "YTA. \n\nYou stated in your post that he works not one, but TWO medical jobs and has an hour commute both ways. And any medical job, particularly this season (if you're in a cold climate), and particularly with all the new viruses around, can be very demanding and taxing. And on top of that, he does all those chores: cleaning the bathroom, the dishes, etc...  \n\n\nBut you also said that you have one job and it's not very taxing and that you do the food-related stuff. You don't mention any other chore-related stuff, so I'm not sure if there's more of an even division of things, but based on the post, it sounds like he is taking on a huge load! And that maybe you can afford to take on more that he sounds (by your post) like he can't or might not want to.   \n\n\nAnd he may very well need (and absolutely deserves) to decompress and relax and not have to \"hop-to\" immediately for every single thing, when he is on his day off. He probably has enough of that at his two jobs already. I think anyone would need a day to jus spend on the couch watching TV and/or playing with their phone, if they were in his position.   \n\n\nAnd then, without even talking to him about it, you just decided (and followed through) with not making any dinner for him? At least a conversation or heads up would have been good. It's understandable that he was upset since this seemed to come out of the blue, since there was no discussion about it.", "NTA. \n\nI usually cook for my spouse and myself (and my kid),  but sometimes I'm not hungry or up to cooking. If it gets close to dinner and I'm not in the kitchen my spouse asks what my dinner plans are (as in- an I going to cook,  do I want him to get take-out, or am I not planning to eat/eating a single portion of leftovers). He asks because he doesn't want to go get take-out if I had a meal planned/produce I need to use up. Not because he expects me to cook if I don't feel like it. \n\nHim flipping out on you is ridiculous- I'm sure he knows where the kitchen/the nearest fast food joint is located.", "NTA.  Try to have a serious discussion with him when everbody has cooled off and is calm.  Ask him if he needs to see a therapist for depression, stress and anxiety.  Tell him how you feel about having to carry your load and his load.", "ESH - Y'all need to have a good old fashioned conversation. Perhaps he will open up to you about being burnt out and needing a little extra help until he can get himself sorted out. \n\nHealthcare is a hard industry to be in right now. Burnout is real. He has two healthcare jobs. That's a lot. \n\nNot saying he gets a pass on any household duties, just saying a conversation is the best place to start instead of just passive agressively not making him a portion of dinner .", "I think ESH to a point. I understand both perspectives, similar issues happened between my wife and I. Communication is the key.\n\nCould things have been handled better? Of course, from both sides. But it's hard as hell to stay rational in the heat of the moment so maybe him taking time away to cool off is the best option. But you both need to sit down and talk about the underlying issues.\n\nIs he just getting burned out at work? Did something happen that rattled him? I've met many in the medical field, especially lately, with lots of traumatic stories that left a lasting mark on them. \n\nYou'd know best but if his behaviour changed suddenly, then that would be my guess.", "YTA. I understand that it is frustrating for you to see the dishes piled up in the sink. I get it. But from what you say, this is not typical behavior from him until recently.  There is definitely something that has caused this. I think you should have told him that you are concerned about his behavior and try to get to the cause for the change.", "YTA\n\nEven if he snapped at you about the dishes, what you did was passive aggressive and unhealthy. You could have said that you were making yourself something to eat and they were on their own. You don't need to give a reason why you're not making food for anyone else, but to do it intentionally as a punishment is childish behavior. \n\nBF needs to pull his weight and was childish in response to your asking about the things that hadn't been done, but you've now opened the door to a never ending tournament of pettiness.", "ESH. Yes, he's not doing his part, but you didn't even ask him why the sudden change in behavior. No, you went a step further and let him find out that you are an asshole at a moment when he was hungry and already in a bad mood. Not sure if you've seen \"The Good Doctor\", but you might wanna talk to your partner.", "...kinda YTA?\n\nBut also not....\n\nI have a similar situation, and that I work from home and do a bulk of the cooking because my partner works very physically tiring job 6 days a week, but he's very good about cleaning up. He only has 1 day off for sure and when he's called in on a Sunday, he will go. I really appreciate how hard he works to make sure that the time that we have together is comfortable.  \n\nIt does suck to feel like you're doing more in the home. I also know where that's coming from for sure and I don't want you to think that you're invalid for being annoyed with it.\n\nI have to admit that there have been a lot of times where he's slacked on dishes or general cleaning and tidying. I used to blow up the same way and react spitefully but I had to realize that relationships aren't 50/50 it's helping/helping. With a LOT of communication. You admitted yourself that it was sudden and you didn't discuss. \n\nTwo healthcare jobs sounds like a lot of stress, and while you do check in on his mental health it's impossible to really know unless he admits it himself. If it's not depression it's certainly stress and exhaustion. Getting chores dumped on you on a day off sucks, and trying to use the kitchen when it was promised to be clean is maddening as hell. BUT, I think you need more understanding. \n\nMy advice is this:\n\n\ud83d\udc9c If you are going to be together in the long run, you need to discuss these issues every time they come up, not just sit with them and let it simmer. \n\nI think it's totally valid that you feel like you are past your breaking point but a conversation would have done wonders. You could each understand then what you're frustrated about, and perhaps he would admit to you why he feels like he can't hold up his end of the deal. And if he honestly can't admit anything other than being lazy then you guys can agree on a plan together.....\n\nI have my own arrangements in my home but we have learned that it's not about always doing everything you can, it's about doing what your partner can't when they are unable. \n\nI have a physical disability and I have let laundry and housework slip lots of times to the point where it's very noticeable and he does get annoyed. Whenever we get to that point I have a talk with him and let him know that I do feel guilty and I wish I could do everything but it's just not possible. I know it's not the same, but on days where it's hard to do all the chores, we will decide on one or two that need to be done for sure before bed time or that you won't make dinner unless the sink is clean. \ud83d\udc9c\n\nPlease talk to your honey, as something as silly as chores can really break a special bond. I hope you guys can talk it out!!!!\n\n\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c", "Well kind of an AH move, BUT well merited IMO and well played. Sounds to me like you did have a discussion before,  but he wasn't getting the message. Well, he got it loud an clear now, didn't he? I personally am not one for dramatics. I will give fair warning, but I absolutely reserve the right to adding a little drama when pushed to a certain point. We teach others how to treat ourselves, by what we allow from them. You just taught him a clear lesson that he cannot push off his responsibilities without any repercussions.", "ESH. You should have warned him, but his behavior is unacceptable.\n\nIt's possible he's depressed. Please encourage him to seek mental health help.", "ESH. You don't need to do the cooking, but i do think having one rest day isn't a lot to ask. And also, you could have said something like \"okay I need a break too, so you should get some takeout\" or something. Maybe it would do you both some good if you had little breaks here and there. I could not be happy with a partner that denied me even one day of rest when I'm already feeling burnt out.", "ESH. You should have been adult enough to tell him first and to say why. \n\nThat said, he sounds like a real peach. Is the screaming new? Can you guys go to counseling?", "YTA for what you did, not how you feel or what you think.  You seem to think your feelings here make up for your behavior.  You are not behaving like a person who feels that commitment goes beyond tasks.  Maybe you would be happier with a cleaning service, and no other expectations in your life?", "YTA, obviously he's struggling and you gave zero fucks about him", "Incompatible", "yta", "He is holding in anger for some reason and what you describe is his passive aggressive way of expressing it as he doesn't want or feel comfortable telling you why. \n\nHis behaviour is inappropriate. There were options for him that you provided. Not options...a sandwhich is a meal. You bought food and had it there for him. \n\nHe offered no such action for you. He decided to act like a child. \n\nThat said, his work schedule/commute does not sound sustainable for a healthy person. If he makes tons of money maybe use some of it for a cleaning and/or meal prep service.", "NTA but you probably get more traction when you say that you cannot cook with dishes in the sink.", "NTA he\u2019s trying to get you to do it.", "ESH\n\nHe's more in the wrong than you for sure. But you could've at least asked what's wrong or something. And wanting a rest day isn't necisarily wrong. Idk i just think a heads up wouldn't have been too much to ask for.", "ESH. You both need to sit down and have a conversation, like adults do.", "Your boyfriend works two jobs, and has an hour commute each way, while you have a cushy job where you can work from home?

Boundaries and emotional intelligence can go a long way and stop things from going south like this.", "ESH\n\nYou claim you have this great and open communicative relationship but your solution was petty and passive aggressive instead of sitting down and talking it out like the mature adults you claim to be. \n\nHe should be pulling his weight and shouldn't have snapped on you,  but you should also have communicated better. \n\nTime to discuss/ reevaluate household chores.", "NTA", "YTA. Instead of having an adult conversation with your husband you decided to go 100% petty and just stoop to not holding up your end of the agreement.", "ESH \nHe shouldn\u2019t have reacted that way and he should be doing a better job of communicating his intentions in getting chores done, but that doesn\u2019t give you a right not to follow your end of the bargain\u2026 feels retaliatory", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019ve been together for 9 years and he hasn\u2019t proposed?

That said, I don\u2019t think your actions were great here. You don\u2019t deserve to be yelled at, treated like a personal chef, or left with all the chores, full stop. His reaction to you not cooking is over the top. At the same time, just cooking for yourself without really talking about it is a passive aggressive way to handle this. You said you\u2019re really open with each other, but you are both communicating poorly right now. I might say something like, \u201cHey, I understand you need some rest and I want you to have that, but when you decide to rest and not do the household stuff we need to get done without talking to me about it, that makes me feel overwhelmed and burned out too. Can we figure out a better way to help you get some downtime?\u201d And then he needs to match that energy and not only be honest with you but also work with you to find solutions rather than just leave you endlessly waiting on him to snap out of it.

Sounds good to me.", "YTA. He works 2 demanding jobs with a big commute. His behaviour is exactly how I am when I\u2019m burnt out from work. Working in health care can be really taxing at times. It\u2019s sucks being burnt out and you don\u2019t always recognize right away that you are burnt out just that you need to take time to get things done and be \u201clazy\u201d. It also sucks he isn\u2019t doing his chores on what\u2019s acceptable for you but as you said your job isn\u2019t demanding and you have zero commute. \nYou should have at least have had a conversation with him about before changing things up and not cooking for him before being petty about it.", "sounds like he's taking you for granted. he has switched from one mom to another (the OP)\n\nsounds like he needs to put his big boy knickers on and grow up", "NTA\n\n>My boyfriend was LIVID.

You didn't cook him ONE meal.  You are THE cook.  One does not piss off the one and only cook.  He didn't hold up his end of the household chores.  You are \"not holding up your end\" as a natural consequence.  He responded by SCREAMING at you and storming off.  Not ok.  You weren't even withholding food.  You pointed him towards sandwich alternatives, gave him a suggestion of getting takeout, or I'm sure, there's still other food in the house, should he want to cook for himself.

If someone sounded (to me) like they were saying I wasn't strong enough to help financially by working two jobs I would be frustrated. I know that's not logical. But it's possible that's how he felt. \nJust saying that intention and perception aren't always equal. He could be taking her comment very differently. \n\nDid she ask how he was feeling or if he needed to vent? He's coming home and zoning out; his behavior changed.

Always thought of myself as one who could deal with most anything but apparently not. The US healthcare system is completely broken and that includes the people who work within it.
