In our household, I do everything cooking related. I come up with recipes, do the grocery shopping, and cook. Boyfriend eats whatever I make and cleans up afterwards. I have been fine with this arrangement up until this point because 1. I like cooking and 2. I work from home and my job is not very demanding. He works 2 healthcare jobs and has an hour commute each way. Given that He is in healthcare, his schedule is not your typical 9-5--he works a lot of weekends and will sometimes have random weekdays off while I work.\n\nLately he has been extremely lazy on his days off. He used to clean the dishes immediately after we ate, but now he has been letting them sit for hours or even overnight while he sits on his phone or watching TV. He has also been slacking in other areas (I can't remember the last time he cleaned our shower, which is one of the other responsibilities he has). I understand that things are still crazy for healthcare workers, so I am trying to give him the benefit of the doubt. But today I reached my breaking point. We have dishes piling up in the sink and he has been sitting on the couch all day long doing absolutely nothing. I asked him after lunch when he planned on doing them, and he snapped at me saying he would get them done but needed a rest day. I am immensely frustrated with this, so I just made dinner for myself only. I didn't give him any warning, just didn't make a portion for him. I sat down and started eating, and he came into the room, our exchange went a little like this:\n\nBF \"Are you messing with me? Where is my dinner?\" Me: \"I didn't make anything for you tonight. You haven't been holding up your end of the household chores and I'm tired of slaving over all your meals while you spend the day on the couch when the house is a total mess. We have stuff for sandwiches or you can get some take out.\"\n\nMy boyfriend was LIVID. He screamed at me and stormed off to get something to eat out. He has been gone about an hour and hasn't returned. I feel kind of badly about it now because we didn't really have much discussion about things before I just blatantly cut him off. But I am tired of doing all the cooking work while he doesn't hold up his end of the bargain. AITA?\n\nETA To those of you suggesting my boyfriend may be depressed and I haven't been checking in on his mental health: I am *constantly* checking in on him to make sure he is ok. We are very open in discussing how things are at work and I have even told him that if it is too much for him to handle mentally he can quit one of his jobs and financially we will be ok. He doesn't want to, he is happy and loves what he does.", "created_utc": 1675289140, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10r7q0y/aita_for_not_warning_my_partner_i_had_stopped/", "score": 150, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Him making you do everything while demanding his meals is very unfair and unappreciative.

He's not going to likely want to recognize it because he doesn't want to admit there's anything wrong with him / the depression time blindness is in his eyes so hard that he doesn't recognize that he hasn't been pulling his load. \n\nThe fucky part of depression is you can love your job and you can love your life and you can still be depressed.

Not very mature.\n\nHow are the bills set up? Are they 50/50? If they are not 50/50, perhaps you doing more chores and cooking dinner makes sense.\n\nRegardless, mature conversations need to be had when you\u2019re both fed and had enough sleep.", "YTA. \n\nYou stated in your post that he works not one, but TWO medical jobs and has an hour commute both ways. And any medical job, particularly this season (if you're in a cold climate), and particularly with all the new viruses around, can be very demanding and taxing. And on top of that, he does all those chores: cleaning the bathroom, the dishes, etc...  \n\n\nBut you also said that you have one job and it's not very taxing and that you do the food-related stuff. You don't mention any other chore-related stuff, so I'm not sure if there's more of an even division of things, but based on the post, it sounds like he is taking on a huge load! And that maybe you can afford to take on more that he sounds (by your post) like he can't or might not want to.   \n\n\nAnd he may very well need (and absolutely deserves) to decompress and relax and not have to \"hop-to\" immediately for every single thing, when he is on his day off. He probably has enough of that at his two jobs already. I think anyone would need a day to jus spend on the couch watching TV and/or playing with their phone, if they were in his position.   \n\n\nAnd then, without even talking to him about it, you just decided (and followed through) with not making any dinner for him? At least a conversation or heads up would have been good. It's understandable that he was upset since this seemed to come out of the blue, since there was no discussion about it.", "NTA. \n\nI usually cook for my spouse and myself (and my kid),  but sometimes I'm not hungry or up to cooking. If it gets close to dinner and I'm not in the kitchen my spouse asks what my dinner plans are (as in- an I going to cook,  do I want him to get take-out, or am I not planning to eat/eating a single portion of leftovers). He asks because he doesn't want to go get take-out if I had a meal planned/produce I need to use up. Not because he expects me to cook if I don't feel like it. \n\nHim flipping out on you is ridiculous- I'm sure he knows where the kitchen/the nearest fast food joint is located.", "NTA.  Try to have a serious discussion with him when everbody has cooled off and is calm.  Ask him if he needs to see a therapist for depression, stress and anxiety.  Tell him how you feel about having to carry your load and his load.", "ESH - Y'all need to have a good old fashioned conversation. Perhaps he will open up to you about being burnt out and needing a little extra help until he can get himself sorted out. \n\nHealthcare is a hard industry to be in right now. Burnout is real. He has two healthcare jobs. That's a lot. \n\nNot saying he gets a pass on any household duties, just saying a conversation is the best place to start instead of just passive agressively not making him a portion of dinner .", "I think ESH to a point. I understand both perspectives, similar issues happened between my wife and I. Communication is the key.\n\nCould things have been handled better? Of course, from both sides. But it's hard as hell to stay rational in the heat of the moment so maybe him taking time away to cool off is the best option. But you both need to sit down and talk about the underlying issues.\n\nIs he just getting burned out at work? Did something happen that rattled him? I've met many in the medical field, especially lately, with lots of traumatic stories that left a lasting mark on them. \n\nYou'd know best but if his behaviour changed suddenly, then that would be my guess.", "YTA. I understand that it is frustrating for you to see the dishes piled up in the sink. I get it. But from what you say, this is not typical behavior from him until recently.  There is definitely something that has caused this. I think you should have told him that you are concerned about his behavior and try to get to the cause for the change.", "YTA\n\nEven if he snapped at you about the dishes, what you did was passive aggressive and unhealthy. You could have said that you were making yourself something to eat and they were on their own. You don't need to give a reason why you're not making food for anyone else, but to do it intentionally as a punishment is childish behavior. \n\nBF needs to pull his weight and was childish in response to your asking about the things that hadn't been done, but you've now opened the door to a never ending tournament of pettiness.", "ESH. Yes, he's not doing his part, but you didn't even ask him why the sudden change in behavior. No, you went a step further and let him find out that you are an asshole at a moment when he was hungry and already in a bad mood. Not sure if you've seen \"The Good Doctor\", but you might wanna talk to your partner.", "...kinda YTA?\n\nBut also not....\n\nI have a similar situation, and that I work from home and do a bulk of the cooking because my partner works very physically tiring job 6 days a week, but he's very good about cleaning up. He only has 1 day off for sure and when he's called in on a Sunday, he will go. I really appreciate how hard he works to make sure that the time that we have together is comfortable.  \n\nIt does suck to feel like you're doing more in the home. I also know where that's coming from for sure and I don't want you to think that you're invalid for being annoyed with it.\n\nI have to admit that there have been a lot of times where he's slacked on dishes or general cleaning and tidying. I used to blow up the same way and react spitefully but I had to realize that relationships aren't 50/50 it's helping/helping. With a LOT of communication. You admitted yourself that it was sudden and you didn't discuss. \n\nTwo healthcare jobs sounds like a lot of stress, and while you do check in on his mental health it's impossible to really know unless he admits it himself. If it's not depression it's certainly stress and exhaustion. Getting chores dumped on you on a day off sucks, and trying to use the kitchen when it was promised to be clean is maddening as hell. BUT, I think you need more understanding. \n\nMy advice is this:\n\n\ud83d\udc9c If you are going to be together in the long run, you need to discuss these issues every time they come up, not just sit with them and let it simmer. \n\nI think it's totally valid that you feel like you are past your breaking point but a conversation would have done wonders. You could each understand then what you're frustrated about, and perhaps he would admit to you why he feels like he can't hold up his end of the deal. And if he honestly can't admit anything other than being lazy then you guys can agree on a plan together.....\n\nI have my own arrangements in my home but we have learned that it's not about always doing everything you can, it's about doing what your partner can't when they are unable. \n\nI have a physical disability and I have let laundry and housework slip lots of times to the point where it's very noticeable and he does get annoyed. Whenever we get to that point I have a talk with him and let him know that I do feel guilty and I wish I could do everything but it's just not possible. I know it's not the same, but on days where it's hard to do all the chores, we will decide on one or two that need to be done for sure before bed time or that you won't make dinner unless the sink is clean. \ud83d\udc9c\n\nPlease talk to your honey, as something as silly as chores can really break a special bond. I hope you guys can talk it out!!!!\n\n\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc9c", "Well kind of an AH move, BUT well merited IMO and well played. Sounds to me like you did have a discussion before,  but he wasn't getting the message. Well, he got it loud an clear now, didn't he? I personally am not one for dramatics. I will give fair warning, but I absolutely reserve the right to adding a little drama when pushed to a certain point. We teach others how to treat ourselves, by what we allow from them. You just taught him a clear lesson that he cannot push off his responsibilities without any repercussions.", "ESH. You should have warned him, but his behavior is unacceptable.\n\nIt's possible he's depressed. Please encourage him to seek mental health help.", "ESH. You don't need to do the cooking, but i do think having one rest day isn't a lot to ask. And also, you could have said something like \"okay I need a break too, so you should get some takeout\" or something. Maybe it would do you both some good if you had little breaks here and there. I could not be happy with a partner that denied me even one day of rest when I'm already feeling burnt out.", "ESH. You should have been adult enough to tell him first and to say why. \n\nThat said, he sounds like a real peach. Is the screaming new? Can you guys go to counseling?", "YTA for what you did, not how you feel or what you think.  You seem to think your feelings here make up for your behavior.  You are not behaving like a person who feels that commitment goes beyond tasks.  Maybe you would be happier with a cleaning service, and no other expectations in your life?", "YTA, obviously he's struggling and you gave zero fucks about him", "Incompatible", "yta", "He is holding in anger for some reason and what you describe is his passive aggressive way of expressing it as he doesn't want or feel comfortable telling you why. \n\nHis behaviour is inappropriate. There were options for him that you provided. Not options...a sandwhich is a meal. You bought food and had it there for him. \n\nHe offered no such action for you. He decided to act like a child. \n\nThat said, his work schedule/commute does not sound sustainable for a healthy person.

But you could've at least asked what's wrong or something. And wanting a rest day isn't necisarily wrong. Idk i just think a heads up wouldn't have been too much to ask for.", "ESH. You both need to sit down and have a conversation, like adults do.", "Your boyfriend works two jobs, and has an hour commute each way, while you have a cushy job where you can work from home?

Why is this not even a question instead of jumping straight to laziness?", "The problem with this though is the wrong partner will just take advantage. \n\nI used to do that with one of my ex's. If he seemed stressed or tired I'd take over his chores for a bit, try and give him more time to rest and sleep. \n\nBut he just got lazier and lazier. And expected me to do more or more. \n\nIf he's having a hard time he should tell her. Not slack off and then snap at her when she mentions it.\n\nHe's a grown man he won't starve from missing one meal and he shouldn't be shouting at her.", "This a 1000%, especially if his yelling/blowing up is a new thing. He shouldn\u2019t have done that, but it could be indicative of a larger issue. \n\nSometimes we just need to veg, but that should be a conversation instead of an argument. Life is incredibly stressful, and sometimes we all suck at communicating that. This is especially true for me when I \u2018know\u2019 there\u2019s something wrong, but I haven\u2019t figured out what\u2019s wrong, or why it\u2019s hitting different than it usually does.", "Yes! I used to have an hour commute and some days I was just so exhausted I couldn\u2019t do anything after work and would fall asleep at like 8pm. Things are way better working from home", "OP said he\u2019s slacking in other areaS beyond the dishes and the shower, and mentions \u201cthe house is a total mess\u201d as being his fault.", "There\u2019s also very little effort in loading the dishwasher, but here we are", "You\u2019re right, I never eat when I have a rest day. How silly.", "[removed]", "Neither is passive aggressively not cooking dinner and not telling him until he sees her about to eat and asks about it.", "\"You don't mention any other chore-related stuff, so I'm not sure if there's more of an even division of things\".....\n\nShe only mentions that she shops, makes the meals, and decides what they will eat, too. By \"huge load\" I mean that he's working two jobs, has a two hour commute, and helps with stuff in the household...That sounds like a big load to me. But maybe that's just me. \n\nMy point is that I can understand that if she is working only one, less demanding job, he may feel a bit frustrated if he feels there's more on his plate and she is badgering him about not doing enough. That's all.", "That's exactly my thoughts as well, especially if it's as recent a change as OP says.", "That edit by OP also misses the point, I'm sure he does love what he does and in the abstract is happy, doesn't change the fact he's burned out and depressed, just means he's also passionate and dedicated", "Agreed. OP is not qualified to determine whether or not he is depressed. He needs a professional evaluation.", "Yeah, it can't be an ongoing thing, but it could be occasional.  There is a difference.  She said lately, which makes me think it isn't ongoing.", "It could be his fault without him having additional chores.  Things that contribute to a dirty house are:\n\n1. not putting your clothes in the hamper, but instead leaving them on the floor in the bathroom/bedroom\n2. Not taking your dirty dishes back to the kitchen\n3. Not throwing away your trash (soda cans, packaging, mail that can be thrown out or sorted),  and instead leaving it all over the house\n4. Not cleaning up your spills/crumbs\n\nNone of these things are assigned chores, they are just the basics of cleaning up after yourself. If someone consistently neglects to do these things the house will become a mess.", "Well, if you are stressed or depressed, doing the dishes can seem like a mountain.  That is why I am not being so quick to judge.  We only get a small picture of the situation, and if the first move was this out of spite, rather than to see if something else was wrong, I think both would suck.\n\nThe goal should be to take care of each other, not tear one another down.\n\nI asked the OP for more info, and to this point, there has been no response.", "Where does it say they have a dishwasher?", "It has nothing to do with eating, it as to do with making something for yourself, when making something for two is such a marginal effort.  To say that it is resting vs trying to make a point or get a rise out of him is turning a blind eye.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\r\n\r\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "One is emotionally abusive and one is just passive aggressive", "Yeah\u2026 my partner currently is in school full time and working part time. He likes his job and loves his school but it\u2019s exhausting for him to be mentally and/or physically engaged 6 days a week. I do about 90% of the house because my situation is like OP\u2019s.  Instead of measuring the division of labour, I measure the amount of free time we each have. If I can do everything before he gets home from work/school, I\u2019m going to do everything (and he doesn\u2019t do nothing, but I feel like he needs one chill day a week.)", "Op has offered them the option to drop one of those jobs as well.", "Also, she has amazing good communication skills when it comes to his mental health but did not communicate she would stop cooking for him... yeah, I take that with a grain of salt.", "Sure, that\u2019s a conversation though. I wouldn\u2019t stop cooking for my two-healthcare-job working partner over some socks on the floor and some crumbs. We all falter sometimes. \n\nAnd I\u2019m not saying the guy here is blameless, but given their work and free time situations relative to one another, I\u2019m willing to cut him a lot of slack.", "Idk why youre gettin so many downvotes. Its a good point. If youre cooking anyway-making enough for 2 vs 1 isnt any more steps. \n\nYoure not saying he is justified in not doong his part and especially not for yelling. But this was done out of spite on ops part, not out of wanting rest.", "They're still both not heathy responses to the situation; either one of them.", "Yep!  And it seems like he doesn't want to quit even though they can afford it.  Well then, some of that extra money can go into a cleaning service once or every other week.   I know several people who consider that part of their mental health care.", "Yup.  Both people handled it poorly IMO.  There isn't enough info to fully judge what is going on, but he sounds depressed or burned out, especially since it is a recent thing.  I don't think being spiteful does anything but worsen the problem.  Calling it rest is intentionally turning a blind eye.", "Oooo yes a cleaning service, this is a good idea OP. At least for a little bit so you can both reset."]}
