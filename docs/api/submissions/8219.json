Her comment was pretty tame compared to yours.", "Yes YTA. So what if she is fat. That was not an appropriate or funny comment. It was intentionally rude.

It\u2019s free, so take it at face value.  If you have to ask AITA, the answer is probably yes.  Adjust yourself accordingly.", "YTA, your comment was inaccurate and inappropriate.

Grow up and fast.", "YTA, mate. A HUGE insulting AH. You never bite the hand that feeds you, got it?", "Word to the wise, dude. You can't talk to everyone the same way you would your friends. I could be wrong, but this is the only logical conclusion i can think of to give you a reason for thinking it was an ok thing to say.
