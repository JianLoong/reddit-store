The defining characteristic of most addicts is extreme selfishness.", "NTA. You're only following orders from the higher-ups not their clients. I've worked with NGO for 10 years and there were some clients who are entitled and pain in the b\u00a5tt. What you can tell her or anyone in the future is that they can talk to their social worker or case worker as everyone has specific duties. You cannot entertain them as it may affect other's work on them. Good luck.", ">NTA.  I really hope Alberta doesn't make such a stink that management puts a stop to the free pizza.  The Albertas of the world ruin everything for everyone.\n\nThis has a great possibility of happening if the client keeps this attitude up. O cannot believe the people calling op that AH. The unmitigated gall of some people! To demand other free food? And it's not like it's just pizza....I would be content of making a meal out of wings and pick up some fries or something from the nearest ff place.", "Nta.  It's a free meal.", "Nta why can\u2019t she eat the wings? Don\u2019t she have other food?", "NTA.  According to my completely uneducated self, her absurd attitude of entitlement is likely related to her addiction.", "NTA\n\n\u201cThe pizza is a donation from someone. It is available to whoever wants it. You don\u2019t want it, which is fine, but there will never be an alternative as the individual donating donates what they are able to.\u201d\n\nJust have a mantra like that and repeat continually. Document her complaints as they sound like it\u2019s developing from a complaint into harassment, or at least developing towards the point where she is going to start making complaints about you.", "NTA it\u2019s not up to you.\n\nYou could suggest that the free pizza stops and see if she will feel less left out then. I suspect not because everybody would hate her for real then.", "NTA. I wouldn't even answer anymore at this point. It has been explained. Why does she feel entitled to get something different? And she can pay for her own food, so on pizza day she can order somewhere else or learn to like pizza and wings(I don't care for pizza either). I'd eat the wings and get something else. The entitlement people have is wild.", "Basically, no good deed goes unpunished. A lot of addicts are severe narcissists. If your brother had provided something else initially, she would hate that instead.", "I\u2019m going to be downvoted to shit for this, but as a therapist I\u2019m going to say YTA, you\u2019re telling someone who is living in a treatment facility that they\u2019re not welcome there, regardless of their behavior that shows that you need to improve your practice. You are sharing a tiny snippet of Alberta here to make her seem like she is simply ungrateful, just to score sympathy points from folks here instead of addressing the situation professionally. We have no idea why she doesn\u2019t want pizza or wings, or even what she\u2019s asking for instead. Is she asking for steak and lobster? Different toppings? Pasta? Salad? \n\nTalk to the therapists there that are working with her, talk to management at the facility, try to understand how your actions could be impacting Alberta\u2019s treatment (the reason why she is there).\nThe pizza and wings don\u2019t sound like a big deal to many people responding to this thread, as they believe they can be had or not had, but it\u2019s not that simple. You as a staff member have power within that facility and power over each patient/client living there. Your refusal to offer an alternative is a refusal to acknowledge that patient\u2019s needs. I understand if this happened on one occasion, but this has been clearly been repeated without moving her further along in feeling like she\u2019s a part of the community. \n\nA lot of folks will disagree, but the best option here is to not provide pizza and wings through you or the facility at all moving forward. If your brother is able to provide food directly through the restaurant, even if it\u2019s the exact same food, it allows you to completely wash your hands of it. If not, then it\u2019s best to not continue with this donation each month moving forward.\n\nWith Alberta specifically this is something her therapists should be made aware of immediately. This is something you all as a staff should be able to have a portion of her treatment plan address. This is not something she should be shamed or othered about. She is the patient here, not a colleague, not a friend, not even just a paying customer. Please remember to treat her as such.", "NTA. It sounds like she has a problem not seeing attacks everywhere. It's pretty apparent when people say yhings like \"it makes me feel like no one wants me around\". Like this is distorted thinking for not liking pizza. \n\n- Free pizza is provided.\n- Someone doesn't like pizza.\n- Person asks for different (free) food. \n- Ask is denied, is given an option.\n- Person refuses the offer.\n- Person thinks others don't like her.\n\nThis is an extreme she's taking needlessly, but unfortunately, people like this are pretty used to manipulating others in this way, even if they don't think they're being manipulative. She needs to be talking to a professional, nit someone that provides very different needs.\n\nShe either thinks you're a professional therapist, or she's just not understanding that this isn't how people get there way. Too many people throw the pitty party, \"nobody likes me\" when they don't get their way.", "Definitely NTA. Who tf doesn't like pizza?", "I'd say it's more like a big Lebowski moment when Walter is asking the dude if he's wrong and the dude responds, you're not wrong Walter, you're just an asshole.\n\nI'd say yta but more from how you seem to handle and disregard people's emotions whether old or not.  You seemed annoyed that you had to have that interaction instead of handling it with grace and understanding you went animosity and entitlement attack mode.\n\nI think there was a better way to handle your point.  \n\nSo nTa just an a.", "NTAH- she is trying to emotionally manipulate you- it\u2019s worked for her in the past and old drug/alcohol habits are hard to break. \nIf she asks again- hand her a menu of other dishes- COLLECT PAYMENT from her for her preferred food first- then pick up the donated pizzas/wings for everyone else and hand her the food she paid for. Not paid for by her? No free food.", "NTA it isn\u2019t you offering the food. It\u2019s not your business. Tell her to take it up with someone else ?", "You are not an AH for not providing a different meal but YTA for the way you handled it. \n\n\"When you have a bad attitude, most people don't want you around.\"\n\nMy dude as someone who works with psych patients (because remember addition is a mental health disorder) telling someone that people don't want them around is not how you deal with this. I obviously don't know what underlying conditions she has that could contribute to her having substance abuse disorder but you can really set someone to spiral with that. You need better de escalation skills going forward. Ask them to explain their feelings more, reassure them that it is not personal but you have no control over what gets donated, be firm with rules, etc.", "The entitlement is probably one of many reasons why Alberta is in trouble in the first damn place.  The gall to complain about free stuff, either take it or don\u2019t.", "OMG Alberta sounds like Mandy from this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13b56e3/wibta\\_if\\_i\\_excluded\\_another\\_woman\\_from\\_our/jj9w9xs/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13b56e3/wibta_if_i_excluded_another_woman_from_our/jj9w9xs/?context=3)  \n\n\nThey should form their own whiny whingers support group for people who want to remain victims", "NAH - but leaning towards NTA. Does the pizza place have something cheaper than wings to sub in for those maybe? A hoagie/sub or mozzarella sticks? Something to mix it up so she can feel included in the group, but doesn\u2019t require you/your brother to buy extras. \n\nAgree with the r/choosingbeggars assessment, but I also know depression and the small amount of joy good food brings. Feeling excluded is never fun, so if you can make a compromise in a way that doesn\u2019t financially impact you/your brother, I would personally choose that route. \n\nThanks for doing this work - it\u2019s so needed and very under appreciated.", "NTA it\u2019s hard to set appropriate boundaries and you did that.", "Accept the things you cannot change (ie what someone chooses to donate to the house)\nChange the things you can (ie, your attitude about what someone has donated to the house).\n\nIf it comes up again tell her she needs to run this by her sponsor and walk away.\n(A good sponsor will tell her to kick rocks and look at *why* she would feel like *no one* wants her around because an effectively anonymous donor drops pizza and wings at the house monthly.

She didn't make a huge deal out of it though.", "Exactly! Almost every other poster here is conveniently not considering that Alberta is living within a mental health treatment facility. She\u2019s there because she needs to work on some things that frankly might have something to do with why this conflict is happening.", "But that isn\u2019t what was agreed to per the pizza place and starts it down a very slippery slope. \n\nNext thing you know, someone else hates pizza and wants a sub, then another wants cheesy bread, another wants fries, etc.", "The thing is, you don't get to ask people who are giving away hundreds (possibly even thousands over the years) of dollars of free stuff to \"throw stuff in\".", "Lmao, the brother is providing free food. How dare the client demand something else for free. And no one told the client she couldn't have just the wings but I'm fairly sure that wouldn't be good enough. You don't just demand people provide an able bodied, working ADULT different free food bc the poor baby feels left out.

A company I used to work at did pizza parties once a month. They tried to have the pizza delivered between the end of first shift and start of second. We were all told if you wanted to take a couple slices to go it was fine as they ordered extra. Ever month the same guy, who was a recovering addict, would be stopped by security, taking out 10 plus full pizzas.

Before everyone can get just ONE plate of food, they pack up three or four plates to take home to the relatives that were too lazy to attend.
