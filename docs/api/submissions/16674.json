This is a free service your brother is offering. She is a person in need of recovery and support, nothing else besides the basics (food, clothing, bed, etc.).

It's not yours or your brother's obligation to pay for a separate meal.", "NTA, your brother is providing FREE pizza. I get if you don't like pizza but she should not be making it such a big problem. She can go and find something else to eat or go out and get something for herself. Im sure if your brother stopped providing it altogether because of her, the other people in the house would be upset at her. This is not something for her to be complaining about. Its free, take it or leave it.", "NTA. You were told clearly by your boss to not buy them things. You\u2019re following the rules.

Plus correct me if I\u2019m wrong but don\u2019t many sober living facilities focus on being honest with clients rather than sugar coating things to them? Again she\u2019s an adult and should be able to handle someone calling her out on her attitude especially if everyone agrees she has a bad one, that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s being targeted it just means she needs an attitude change if she wants people to actually like her and include her more.", "Nta what a weird pick me thing to complain about.  Its a donation not room service", "NTA. She doesn't care that everyone else enjoys the pizza & wings, & asking for something different sounds like entitlement or else trying to ruin their pizza night because she feels left out. As you said, people are usually left out because of their attitude & being unpleasant for others to be around. Hopefully she hears what you've told her & makes changes, cuz I don't really think it's about the pizza. Some people just don't like others to be happy.", ">he has offered to provide wings and pizza for everyone once a month\n\nYour brother is awesome.\n\nNTA, the food is a donation, it's like going to a pantry and demanding a different type of food than what is being given out.\n\nYou could have been nicer about it but the point was made.
