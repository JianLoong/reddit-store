How does that possibly prepare her for being an active member of society where in all other social circumstances the world won't revolve around Alberta?\n\nAlso, if Alberta thinks she feels unwelcome now, imagine how she's going to feel when the other pizza loving renters find out that she's the reason free pizza night is canceled going forward.", "> Your refusal to offer an alternative is a refusal to acknowledge that patient\u2019s needs\n\nThey cannot buy a meal for an individual client. The facility can accept a donation, but a staff member cannot buy something explicitly for one person. There is no alternative here. Have some or do not. She can go about her dinner plans as usual if she doesn't like the donation.", "Just out of curiosity, do you assume the pizza place is magically able to provide more for the salad you think is \u201ceasily\u201d added?", "This happened so much at my office I stopped bringing in donuts \ud83d\ude43 this one lady left a post it note with her sandwich, coffee and donut preference on my desk \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "To take home? Entitled much. And oh you didn\u2019t get a jelly donut GFTO", "I was gonna say, I\u2019ve worked with some people in *extreme* addiction situations and this just sounds like someone who\u2019s had a rough time and has some messed up self-perspectives. Addiction can lead to a lot of twisted and sometimes narcissistic thinking processes (a lot of them coming from self preservation). This person definitely needs to work this out on her own though it\u2019s not OP\u2019s problem.", ">OP needs to stress that the pizza is not an amenity of the sober housing, but a kindness from someone who wants to pay it forward.\n\nI think this is the right approach. The sober housing does not supply the pizza, it is a donation. They simply accept what's donated. You don't make special requests for a donation, you take what's on offer.", "And he shouldn't.", "Plus it\u2019s a pizzeria what else are they going to donate - Indian food? Although, I have had a chicken Marsala pizza where the crust was basically naan bread and that was awesome.", "The rule is that staff can not spend their own money on clients. The pizza donor is a former client doing something kind. Not staff.", "This makes absolutely no sense. The employee is following the rules to a t, no spending his own money on the residents. The pizza is a donation just like any other. Just because there is a tie to the house as a former resident and the brother of an employee doesn't change the fact that it is a donation just like you would be gifting pizza to the house.", "I appreciate the reminder that this lady isn't necessarily just some bad person because she's being rude in this instance, she's probably lashing out. It's easy to forget that.", ">r/ChoosingBeggars\n\nI think this is actually WHY she's demanding something different. If it was just an anonymous donor, or the business itself, she probably wouldn't be bothering OP about it.", "I honestly feel like OP is an asshole. They work at a sober living facility, they can't be kind and considerate? Instead it's basically \"you dont like pizza? fuck off stop bothering me.\"", "The wording obviously matters. Wording and lack of tact often makes someone an asshole when they aren't.", "I\u2019d be fucking livid if someone did that to me! I\u2019m also petty AF so I\u2019d send out a department email letting everyone know exactly why I stopped bringing in donuts", "WHAT?!!!  Entitlement at its best.  The audacity of this woman.", "Op said in post she did tell it was a donation and Alberta can\u2019t dictate what is donated. Alberta knows this is not included with the facility. I bet Alberta will complain and the facility will be forced to turn away the offer of the pizza sadly.", "ok, now I'm a bit curious why the original one got banned.", "My little town has an amazing Indian/pizza place. The naan butter chicken pizza is the drunk snack you never knew you always wanted", "I mean, most pizza places offer salads at least.\n\nNot that the pizza place should offer them for free unless the owner/manager decides they want to. But that is likely something they could offer, if they wanted.", "Some other commenters are saying that they often have to take blunt, direct approaches to halting manipulative behaviours. This lady is trying to manipulate OP into feeling obligated to buy her other food, despite clear understanding from her that it is a donation and not something specifically ordered by the facility. They can give emotional support, but this encounter isn't the place for it.", "We used to have a client appreciation picnic and the second year, the adult children of some good clients would grab about 10 pork chops each at the start of the meal service. We then had the caterers serve the food instead of letting people help themselves.", "Yup. I used to work for a large public institution which had several great personnel restaurants and cafes. One of the cafes started distributing leftover products (sandwiches, pastry etc.) just before closing. People would go and take 1 or 2. Then one lady from my department found out and started going there every afternoon with a large bag and take everything. She would even go \"oh, it's time to go get the pastries, see you in a bit!\" She saw absolutely no problem in her behavior.", "No way a company was over ordering that much he was screwing second shift out of their share.", "We were hybrid for a while before going fully remote. I just thought Friday donuts to make it through the day would be nice nope she ruined it for everyone", "> I bet Alberta will complain and the facility will be forced to turn away the offer of the pizza sadly.\n\nThis seems like a bit of a leap. Under what grounds would this happen? Seems pretty clear that the staff and administration at the facility is team \"free pizza donation\" and not team \"Alberta\" so unless there is a law to point to I don't see how her complaint would amount to anything.", "I'm not sure I agree. I see your point though.", "Well played", "It's not a leap. No one wants to deal with the complainer all the time, so the easiest solution is to get rid of the pizza donation. They can't get rid of Alberta, no one has the time/ capacity/ training to manage her, and most people aren't confrontational enough to tell her to sit down and shut up.", "I'm curious what else you think the lady was trying to get the OP to do. That is an attempt to manipulate to get one's own \"special\" treat that is not available to the rest of the facility. She wants special treatment and for the OP to provide what she wants when she wants it.", "In a perfect world I'd tweak the wording used and not accidentally confirm her attitude makes her unlikeable (the only part I'd say wasn't great), but it's easy to feel put on the spot with stuff like this. Emotional manipulation *intends* to put you on the spot so it's harder to say no.", "What did company do", "I meant about how to respond. Also, it's easy to paint things as manipulation. For example, are you attempting to manipulate me into agreeing with you?", "That's the part I have an issue with. Telling her no is a reasonable thing to do. Making her out to be an unlikable person isn't.", "Made him take it back inside, and yes he was taking second shifts pizza. It actually became a big joke.", "Honestly I'm surprised he wasn't fired after the second or third time - at that point it's both insubordination and theft.", "It had to do with the company. It was European based. They sucked at hr and interaction. They wanted results. This guy was the spare parts attendant. He knew where all the parts you needed were. At the same time if you went in there. He always told you he had coded 3 times so he was meant to be there."]}
