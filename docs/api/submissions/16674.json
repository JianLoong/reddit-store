I'm not allowed to buy anything for the residents here and what is given to us isn't my decision\"\n\nSaying \"when you have a bad attitude, most people don't want you around\" is kind of a shit thing to say. How you describe the interaction  makes you sound apethetic", "NTA. Alberta needs to let go and let god.", "NTA.", "I think you've handled this beautifully.", "I work with at risk populations. Currently I am working at a TAY housing facility (ages 18 to 25). The way our house is set up, we do have shared food for people but it is from donations. When people get their food stamps (which we help with) there is no steps taken to prevent allergies. It is just not something that can be done. People come from all walks of life, with all kinds of skillsets. Most of the people don't know how to properly clean. So contamination would be a huge issue. \n\nWe actually tell clients that we cannot make sure the house is safe for severe allergies. There is just no way to do it unless someone is handling all the cooking and food prep, which is not possible with adults. So if she was allergic to the food, I don't think it would stop it from being brought into the house.", "Lmao I was just thinking that", "I work with homeless people. And this is the sort of thing that happens. \n\nOne of the clients ranked us as favourites. \ud83e\udd23Then we would move up the list if we did something nice. They got pissed when I said, \"I am not offended, because I don't care where I am ranked on a list of four people. But that is gonna make people really upset, so you need to stop doing it.\"\n\nThey did it one more time and I said, \"If you are going to rank people, then I don't need to be hanging out with you right now. You need to respect my boundary.\"\n\nThe ranked list made a staff member really upset because she does so much for them and they weaponize her kindness. I personally don't give a shit, but I don't want to hear stupid shit like that. \ud83d\ude43", "No one uses real names in these posts. I am not the Op, but I have seen maybe one post on here that says \"used real names.\" Everyone else uses fake ones. So I doubt this person used real names at all.", "Based on the information provided, it seems likely that the brother was hired by his sponsor to work at the establishment rather than owning the place. It is important to keep in mind that businesses have budgets and menu items that are carefully selected to meet those budgets. Therefore, it is possible that the specific wings and pizza being provided are what the establishment is able to afford and what is on their menu.\r  \n\r  \nIt would not be appropriate to bring up this issue with the brother who is providing the donation. It is important to remember that the donation is a kind gesture, and if the recipients do not like what is being provided, they have the option to ask for it to stop or to simply take what is given to them. It is also important to consider that the brother may not have the resources to provide more expensive or varied menu items, and it is unfair to expect him to do so. Ultimately, the recipients should be grateful for the donation and focus on the kind intention behind it rather than nitpicking the specific details of the offering.", "As someone who works with homeless individuals, I know that it's important to be specific about our needs when asking for donations, but we also have to be realistic and flexible. We can ask for \"women's clothing\" or \"more canned foods,\" but we can't demand specific brands or styles. And unless there's a medical need, we take what we can get and donate the rest to our sister programs. Being too specific can turn people off from donating, and it's important to maintain good relationships with our donors. When it comes to food donations, we generally take what we can get and clients are free to take it or leave it. It's important to remember that most people in shared housing are on food stamps or eating donated food, and they're used to taking what's available. The same goes for pizza or other food donations - we can't make specific demands or we risk coming across as ungrateful. Ultimately, the goal is to provide a safe, drug-free environment for our clients where they can work on their recovery and regain their independence.", "I am not OP, but I do work with homeless/addicted populations.   \n\n\nIn transitional and sober living spaces, managing allergies is often not feasible unless there is a designated person responsible for cooking for the entire group. At the TAY facility where I work, there is no overnight staff, and residents are given access to food or can buy their own with food stamps. As not everyone has the same living skills, we provide guidance on basic sanitary practices. \n\nWhen individuals move in, we inform them that we cannot accommodate allergies, and that there is a risk of cross-contamination. We rely on donations for meals and do not purchase individual items unless approved by the shelter manager. \n\nIf the facility in question is one where individuals pay rent and work, it is not the staff's responsibility to provide food for others. Especially because those facilities come with the expectation of self-sufficiency in some ways. People aren't coming off the street with their life in shambles, they just need help overcoming addiction.\n\nIn my experience, it is impractical to anticipate that staff can cater to allergies beyond the initial discussion. At my facility, we require individuals to sign several waivers that absolve us of liability for any health deterioration, allergies, property loss, physical harm, and other related matters. \n\nLiving with a group of strangers inevitably entails a degree of risk. Presumably, the same holds true in this scenario. Without a significant amount of paperwork and administrative hurdles, it is challenging to secure insurance for such facilities.\n\nAlberta likely signed paperwork stating all of the things above and that she provide her own food. She was probably informed of all the rules involving staff providing meals. So this is not Op's fault.", "I\u2019m living for OP\u2019s response saying yeah, people don\u2019t like bad attitudes", "Exactly this. In a support system group setting you need to have rules and bending them for things like donation pizza is too confusing.", "I work with homeless populations. We have some contact with sober living facilities. Some are straight rehab, but the majority that are in my area seem to be pay to stay. So people have to have jobs, they pay for their own resources, they just get a place to stay that won't trigger their addictions. If this is one of those places, then even getting the pizza is a luxury.", "Right? Like even if you HATE pizza or burgers or cake, you must realize that the vast majority of people LIKE those things. I've had a weird relationship with food most of my life and I've never once been upset with people for providing food that the majority like and will eat. It's bizarre.  \n\n\nMy relationship with food is currently the best it has been, but now my body has decided it wants to kill me with bad cholesterol, or give me skin issues from gluten and other shit. Guess what? Still don't cry about it at a party.", "Reminded her of her PLACE? Please never work with vulnerable people. As someone in psychology that is completely abhorrent.", "you think that\u2019s bad - at my work We get free food all the time like multiple times a week l, always different stuff. We  are a medical practice and sometimes people will bring free Starbucks and stuff and they\u2019ll just bring like 10 or 15 or whatever and it\u2019ll just be a random selection and a girl that I work with got pissed to the point of slamming her fists on the table and mind you, this is an adult, she was slamming her fists on the table because there wasn\u2019t any ice coffee in the flavor she wanted when we got it for free.", "Correct. Reminded her of her place. As in if you want to be an ass hat to others, then others will return the energy or will refuse to be around you. As someone who works in psychology you should really get a grasp on how to read and interpret sentences.", "Ingrate", "Yeah, agreed. Some people just have to be victims. \n\nI had a co-worker who claimed to be allergic to mushrooms. When the team went out to lunch, she would always make a huge deal about how she couldn't have mushrooms. She'd make a point of telling the waiter she couldn't have mushrooms. She'd specifically ask which dishes were guaranteed to be free of mushrooms.\n\nThen, no matter what she'd ordered, she'd make a scene and insist her food had been adulterated with mushrooms. Every. Damned. Time.", "Live my life and then talk to me about how I feel.", "Imagine Coca Cola offered a pallet of cans as a donation. Would Alberta insist on someone getting her a Pepsi??", "Hahahaha you should have asked her if she needed a time out to gather her feelings!", "My partner is allergic to corn. \ud83d\ude2d We cannot eat a lot of the normal stuff. Luckily it's not so serious that she can't be around it.", "Telling people with very obvious mental health issues that unless they act perfectly no one\u2019s going to help them is\u2026.. moronic. If OP doesn\u2019t want to deal with people who need more help than most, they should get a different job. As someone who works in psychology, please stay away from people who are a suicide or addiction risk.  \n\nEdit: person who commented below blocked me so here\u2019s my response: I mean. Sure. But this lady didn\u2019t call him names though, she said \u201cI feel left out\u201d and \u201cI feel like no one wants me around\u201d, which in this case is pretty much the most clear cut cry for help she could\u2019ve given. Giving boundaries for volatile behavior is different from affirming someone\u2019s insecurities while they\u2019re trying to recover from addiction.", "It is incorrect to assume that the statement made by the initial speaker was unnecessary, simply because the personality of the individual in question is not fully known. \n\nThese individuals are essentially renting accommodations. It is not uncommon for adults living together to not have compatible personalities, and it is not the responsibility of staff members who are driving them or simply socializing with them to ensure that all parties are best friends with each other. These individuals have their own separate lives and occupations (from the sound of the post). They just rent rooms in this facility.\n\nIn my experience working with at-risk populations, I've learned that not everyone will get along with each other all the time, no matter how much effort is put into facilitating positive interactions. This is particularly true in situations where people are living in close quarters, such as in a shared housing arrangement. It's not uncommon for minor conflicts to arise, and sometimes these conflicts can escalate into larger issues. However, it's important to remember that individuals have their own unique personalities and backgrounds that may make it difficult for them to get along with everyone. As service providers, our role is to support clients in achieving their goals and improving their lives, not to force them to be friends with each other.", "It literally was said. But given your post history I can tell you\u2019re pro life so clearly critical thinking is not for you.", "With years now clean and sober, knowing now what it took, I might just lay in wait for that delivery on the ay. But this behavior is not uncommon in early sobriety so, hang in there girl, there's a gallon of your favorite ice cream and a favorite movie or two waiting.", "I made nachos for a party and the boyfriend of the hostess scraped all the cheese off and just ate that.", "Yeah I was just floored I couldn\u2019t stop giggling.", "But like... that doesn't seem to be what was said. Op never said they would not help them. I work with homeless clients and some of them annoy the fuck out of me. I am super frustrated with a lot of clients that I work with. That doesn't mean I don't help them. We are also honest about what behaviour we expect from people and how we want to be talked to. At some point you have to be blunt, because no one is going to give them the luxury of behaving like that in the outside world.\n\nWe are very clear with them that behaviour plays a lot in whether we go out of our way with extras. A client called me a b\\*tch the other day. Then two seconds later he asked for some chips I had for lunch. I told him no. You don't talk to me like that and then expect me to give you extras.\n\nHe asked for a ride to the store so he didn't have to walk. I said, \"No. You called me a b\\*tch. You can walk.\"\n\nI still took him to a job interview. I still made sure we sat down and did his resume. I made sure he has shoes and clothes for his job. I make sure all of his stuff is done, but extras that come from our own pocket or time aren't part of the program. We tell clients all the time that we get they have trauma, it is not easy. But you can be mad about something and not call someone a name.\n\nWe have also discussed that not liking someone doesn't mean you show it. I have clients I absolutely hated. They would never have known. But I was honest about boundaries, I was honest about behaviour, and I was honest about how people would react to that.", "I just told you exactly what was said verbatim and explained how to interpret it. \nAlso you DEFINITELY can\u2019t read if you read through my history.
