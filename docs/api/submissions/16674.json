With the exception of responding to her \u201cit makes me feel\u201d statement by offering an opinion about how others feelings are impacted by one person\u2019s attitude (neither necessary nor unnecessary, but directly invited by her bringing feelings into it), everything seems very cut and dry: it\u2019s against the rules to buy people things, and her trying to equate OP to OP\u2019s brother as the donor (and then trying to guilt him into special treatment for her) is a manipulation tactic that is best dealt with precisely and without \u201csoftening\u201d the message - which could be perceived as a potential opening to exploit. \n\nAddicts are sometimes known to have excellent manipulation skills, owing to the necessity of finding ways to get others to support their unpopular habits. It\u2019s a kindness to keep everything straightforward and brook no bending of rules, as an important part of operating as a returning member of society.", "In the post it says she asked if OPs brother could provide her something different, so she does know.", "I agree about \u201cyour attitude makes people not like you,\u201d being kind of inappropriate. \n\nAlso, does she just not like pizza or does she maybe have a health issue that makes pizza and wings hard for her to eat?
