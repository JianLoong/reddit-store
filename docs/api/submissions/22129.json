Sally and my dad have been married for 13 years.\n\nI haven't had an easy life, but am doing pretty well considering. I am in school, working full time, am in my first healthy relationship, and have a great group of friends. My sister Sam goes back and forth between our dads and moms house. She doesn't like going to our dads because of Sally. Sally is a huge alcoholic, and is pretty much guaranteed to be blackout drunk by the time Sam is home from school. Sally is mean, bossy, and always yelling at everyone. She also despises me, and always has. I assume it's because I was the only kid who ever pushed back at her. I refused to go to her church (we were never religious and I don't believe in that.) I wouldn't let her tell me what to wear, eat, who to date, what to study, etc, whereas Sam and Justin were more lenient and go with the flow. I also have always stood up for my siblings when she treats them unfairly (which is often.)\n\nLast week Sam called me crying, asking me to pick her up from our dads. I dropped everything and immediately picked her up. When she got in the car she told me that Sally was drunk and yelling at her, telling her to never grow up to be \"a sneaky, lying, manipulative whore like Maia\" (me). I guess she followed it up with \"We would've all been better off if Maia never did the treatment.\" (I was diagnosed with stage 2 cancer 18 months ago and just got cleared last month.)\n\nI kept my calm around Sam, dropped her off at my moms, and went back to my dads. He was home at this point, they were all having dinner and he asked what was going on. I told Harper to go play outside for a few minutes, and unloaded on Sally. I said some really mean things, such as, \"Harper would be better off if my dad left you and got full custody\", \"you're a washed up nobody who freeloads off my dad\" \"none of us like you anyways\" and \"if you ever say something like that to Sam again I will make sure you never see Harper again.\" Before storming out. I gave Harper a hug in the driveway, got in my car, and drove away.\n\nMy dad immediately called Sam and told him what happened and Sam backed me up, but my dad is insisting I apologize and said I took it too far. I hung up on him and haven't answered since, but have gotten messages from Sally's friends because she made a facebook post about the interaction.\n\nAITA?\n\nTLDR: Stepmom told sister mean things about me, i unloaded on her and now my dad wants me to apologize, but I dont want to.
