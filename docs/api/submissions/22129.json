(Sam, 15F, Justin, 20M, and Harper 8F). Harper is the only child related to my stepmom (Sally, 48F). Sally and my dad have been married for 13 years.\n\nI haven't had an easy life, but am doing pretty well considering. I am in school, working full time, am in my first healthy relationship, and have a great group of friends. My sister Sam goes back and forth between our dads and moms house. She doesn't like going to our dads because of Sally. Sally is a huge alcoholic, and is pretty much guaranteed to be blackout drunk by the time Sam is home from school. Sally is mean, bossy, and always yelling at everyone. She also despises me, and always has. I assume it's because I was the only kid who ever pushed back at her. I refused to go to her church (we were never religious and I don't believe in that.) I wouldn't let her tell me what to wear, eat, who to date, what to study, etc, whereas Sam and Justin were more lenient and go with the flow. I also have always stood up for my siblings when she treats them unfairly (which is often.)\n\nLast week Sam called me crying, asking me to pick her up from our dads. I dropped everything and immediately picked her up. When she got in the car she told me that Sally was drunk and yelling at her, telling her to never grow up to be \"a sneaky, lying, manipulative whore like Maia\" (me). I guess she followed it up with \"We would've all been better off if Maia never did the treatment.\" (I was diagnosed with stage 2 cancer 18 months ago and just got cleared last month.)\n\nI kept my calm around Sam, dropped her off at my moms, and went back to my dads. He was home at this point, they were all having dinner and he asked what was going on. I told Harper to go play outside for a few minutes, and unloaded on Sally. I said some really mean things, such as, \"Harper would be better off if my dad left you and got full custody\", \"you're a washed up nobody who freeloads off my dad\" \"none of us like you anyways\" and \"if you ever say something like that to Sam again I will make sure you never see Harper again.\" Before storming out. I gave Harper a hug in the driveway, got in my car, and drove away.\n\nMy dad immediately called Sam and told him what happened and Sam backed me up, but my dad is insisting I apologize and said I took it too far. I hung up on him and haven't answered since, but have gotten messages from Sally's friends because she made a facebook post about the interaction.\n\nAITA?\n\nTLDR: Stepmom told sister mean things about me, i unloaded on her and now my dad wants me to apologize, but I dont want to.

I\u2019m sorry you had the kind of stepmom that gives stepmoms a bad name.

You need to make your own post with that extreme detail and tag her and your Dad!! Let everyone know why you think she's a despicable person!!", "\"work\".

Your dad backs up a woman who wished you were dead. He's an enabler who is letting his kids be abused. He is just as guilty as she is.", "NTA. She wished you dead. What a vile woman. Make sure your dad and all her friends know that. You need to demand an apology from her and your dad. Call CPS too.", "NTA: step mom is absolute trash.", "You know how they blame women for staying with slme dudes cuz their ween is good... your dad is with this h*e for the same reasons...", "NTA. What kind of weak pathetic shell of a man does your father have to be to defend the woman who essentially said that she wished his daughter had died?

It may not be your responsibility bit I am begging you, having been a victim of a parent's alcohol abuse you probably only know half of what's really going on and none of it is good.

You did the right thing and sounds like your father is the real a hole here.  Sally is a loss cause unless she not only gets help with her alcoholism but makes amends.  Doesn\u2019t sound like that will be happening.", "NTA and I hope you double down. Tell them that you'll be doing the exact same thing every time you find out that witch is abusing the kids.

I'm glad you stood up for yourself, and your siblings.", "NTA. Sally said mean things about you behind your back. You said them to her face.\n\nSaying everyone would be better off if you literally DIED is about the absolutely height of fucked up ness.", "NTA and way to stick up for your family", "NTA. I\u2019d find a way to get records/evidence of Harper being left along with drunk Sally, and call CPS.", "Yeah this.  What your stepmother said and how she behaves is completely awful and it's really worrying that your father can't see that.", "She basically wished you were dead. Did you tell that to her friends who were messaging you!NAT", "I think the dad needs to grow a spine and stand up for his kids.", "Nah, we don\u2019t apologize to shitty people.", "Why should she?", "Honestly? Sally kind of deserved it.", "As someone who grew up with an alcoholic mom and abusive boyfriend, all I can say thank you for being that role. My sister took it up and honestly there isn\u2019t anything she wouldn\u2019t do to protect me. You\u2019re role in their life is more important than you\u2019ll ever realize as they know at least one person has their back unconditionally.", "They will appreciate what you done for them forever, I hope you know that."]}
