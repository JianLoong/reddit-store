I became a really good liar to my parents and I still hold resentment that I was not able to experience a home that showed support, only one in which handing out corrective punishments was the immediate and only response.\n\nSo with all that, please take this part with a pinch of salt: I think that the best thing for you and your wife to do is to understand why he was selling drugs. Was it money? Fitting in with the crowd? Is he addicted? Most people have an emotion tied behind even compulsive behaviors.

You are not so much punishing him as trying to keep him out of jail.  Since you and your wife are on the same page, you are doing the best you can in her absence.  Ideally, she would take the lead on how to handle this long term.  His defiance is to be expected, but you are the adult in this scenario and you are definitely acting in his best interests.", "NTA, you might not be his bio dad, but you have been parenting fair and square, in any case if he is living under your roof (which I assume is the case), he has to respect your rules and I bet people wouldn't want someone dealing drugs in their houses, I suggest therapy and talking with him a lot, it looks like he needs some attention which he didn't get from his bio dad.", "NTA. He's committing a felony, don't back down.", "He does not want to go down this path. The only way it ends up is either jail or death. I truly hope you can get him some help and maybe he will see the error of his ways but it would be heartbreaking if he has to learn the hard way when it comes to selling drugs and joining gangs.\n\nNTA", "YTA for questioning yourself if it\u2019s ok to set boundaries for a kid who may be harming himself or others with drugs.", "YTA for 'punishing' him. He needs education, help and support.  Can his mother and you show him some of the effects of drug use?  This might be better coming from someone else that he respects.\n\nNTA for taking away the phone because you need to intervene to prevent him getting hurt or arrested.", "NTA. Dealing drugs is a big deal. But taking away his phone isn\u2019t enough though as he may just be more careful about things now. You need to make sure to fix the situation so he wants to stop himself.", "NTA.  However I think you need to get your son into therapy.  Being uncharacteristically moody and getting in trouble might be a sign of deeper problems than just being a teen.", "You are the father. You set boundaries and he pushed, NTA", "So nta. I'd kindly remind him if \"just some guy\" caught him selling drugs in his living room, he'd likely be un jail right now. He better thank his lucky stars you're not \"just some guy\"", "NTA-the best thing about electronics and teens is how effective they are for disciplining.", "I just wanted to let you know, at 16, he could be charged as an adult in most places. Selling prescription drugs is a felony.", "But please be clear that something is causing this change in behavior, and given how he lashed out it may very well be unresolved issues of abandonment by his biological father. Please get him into some form of therapy", "NTA as the responsible adult with custody over the child, you did great. That situation needed to be addressed immediately. Very very bad things could have happened without intervention.\n\nMy mother would have shackled me to the dining room table until I was 35.", "Depending on type of pills this could be felony charges that will not go lightly just because he's still a minor.", "NTA", "Taking his phone is not enough. Selling drugs will land him in prison or worse", "NTA. Having him change schools, if possible, would be a really good idea.  He needs to cut off all contact with these kids and get a whole new group of friends.", "NTA\n\nImo, this isn't punishment. This is just keeping a pill pusher constant interaction with him. Punishment is more. He's breaking the law & seriously going down the road. I'd seriously think about boot camp for teens or a private school hours away.", "He doesn't know what is in those pills. They could be laced with fentanyl and he could be charged with the death of an unsuspecting victim. I have a distant cousin currently in prison for exactly this. \n\nNTA.", "N.T.A.

Jack is treading on dangerous ground.", "NTA at all. Keep being a good dad.", "He probably does not have any issues with OP, but teens and kids use any excuse to get out of punishment. You're not my real mom/dad is a popular one because they are mad. He probably just lashed out wanting to hurt OP because he is angry. Does not mean he actually has any issues with him", "and if you do leave him alone make sure he has sone way to contact you in case of an emergency. trust me, you might think nothing will happen but i\u2019ve been there", "Unfortunately no amount of therapy is going to help OP\u2019s stepson if he doesn\u2019t see the problem and is not ready to do the work. It doesn\u2019t sound like he is. I worked with clients who were mandated for years and the ones who never saw a problem didn\u2019t have good treatment outcomes.

You did the right thing. Teenagers will say all kinds of things they don\u2019t mean to hurt. And even if he does mean it, you are one decent human for caring! It\u2019s not going to be easy getting him back on the straight and narrow. I wish you and your wife luck. Stay strong.", "I guess you are NTA if he\u2019s using his phone inappropriately but it\u2019s not going to fix things.\nHe needs professional help", "NTA\n\nCalling the cops on him would be an ass for first offense. Taking his phone away, which would hopefully have the effect of stopping him from ruining his life by getting arrested for distribution of drugs, is not.  For him to throw it in your face that you are not his father when you have been loving and raising him for more than half his life was a shitty thing to do on his part. \n\nWhat do you think his bio dad would have to say about this activity?  Would he care enough to try and stop it? Is that part of his attitude about you just being some guy, or is it just childish tantrum for not being allowed to sell drugs using a phone you probably provided in the first place? Is he afraid of what his friends will do if he no longer sells their drugs for them? Still not the ass, but maybe this should be talked about when mom gets home.", "NTA", "NTA why would you even need to ask this question? I find it very difficult to believe that it almost 50 year old man would even have to ask something like this. Obviously you are not the a****** and especially with all of the fentanyl deaths that have been occurring this is a really big deal. I am speaking as a lifelong addict who is currently in remission, Fentanyl is no joke. You need to stalk your home with Narcan.", "NTA. He is heading down a **bad** path. Depending on what you mean by 'gangs' he's risking not only his future/criminal record, but his physical safety. He should absolutely be grounded, but I'd also heavily encourage you and your wife to get him into therapy and see if there are any diversion programs you can get him into. \n\nWhere I live, there are diversion programs and classes that are run/staffed by individuals who got caught up in things like this and didn't get out for decades. In my experience, hearing 'selling pills for a friend is illegal and is going to jeopardize your future, we are very worried for you' plays very differently with a teenager than 'I started selling pills for a friend, ended up involved with a gang, have seen and done horrible things and getting my life back on track took years of incredibly hard work' does with a teenager.", "NTA. You usually aren't when they pull out the \"you're not my *real* dad\" line, but particularly in this situation. This is really serious, though. Grounding him probably isn't going to fix anything. You guys need to work out a plan.", "Nta", "NTA. You have to think of the family as a whole and his involvement could get 13 noticed by the wrong people. They like to involve kids because they have lesser punishments but they also like sex so young girls who are malleable are a win-win", "NTA.", "NTA, but also you guys have bigger problems to deal with, taking his phone won't stop him from doing what he wants to do, especially when bad influences are involved.", "\"Some guy\" or not, it's your house and you are liable for actions taken within. Perhaps look up some cases, in your or similar areas, where the actions of a minor have negatively impacted their parents and siblings.\n\nNTA and maybe (given the selling for another person thing) work with those in your community that have experience with this. I don't think therapy will work right now, but a mentorship or community program might.", "NTA - Excellent parenting - quick reaction, well backed up by your spouse - this is team parenting.", "I mean I'm always in support of therapy, even if nothing is \"wrong\" it's still a very useful and sometimes vital tool. But I don't know that the son necessarily has unresolved issues with his stepfather. It sounds like he's just a teenager lashing out and using whatever insults he can throw because he's facing punishment. I mean, I could be totally wrong of course. But unless they've had issues in the past in their relationship, this just sounds like a pretty stereotypical teenage response to necessary discipline. (The whole dealing drugs is an entirely separate issue, one that probably *does* indicate therapy is necessary.)", "The other thing is that you need to get bio dad on the same page\u2014whether thats bringing him into the \u201cyou aren\u2019t going to be a drug dealer\u201d convo, or just calling him up with your wife and laying out the game plan, doesn\u2019t matter. You just need to make sure that bio dad isn\u2019t undermining the rules when Jack is with him. \n\nGood luck!", "Exactly. I used to (my boys are in their 20\u2019s) say if I didn\u2019t piss them off once a week I wasn\u2019t doing my job.", "I was about to say yes until the selling drugs. NTA", "NTA but also you need to have a conversation with your stepson ASAP to see if he actually has pills in his possession and/or has had pills fronted to him that he owes someone money for. You need to make sure he\u2019s not in physical danger because he\u2019s in debt to someone, especially if he\u2019s befriended gang members.

You have a close relationship with your step-children and have been acting as one of their guardians for a decade. As long as you and your wife have agreed on what your role is in their lives, I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong.\n\nThat being said\u2014was this a very sudden behavioral change? Maybe I\u2019m missing some context clues, but it sounds like it from the way this was written. If so, sudden changes like this can indicate kids struggling with depression or other mental health issues. Of course, he could just be sixteen and in an immature stage of life. But I can\u2019t help but wonder if it\u2019s worth pursuing therapy of some kind for him.", "I put this in another comment but I need to make sure you see this OP. You need to have a conversation with your stepson ASAP to see if he actually has pills in his possession and/or has had pills fronted to him that he owes someone money for. You need to make sure he\u2019s not in physical danger because he\u2019s in debt to someone, especially if he\u2019s been hanging out with known gang members. Try to stay as calm as possible and come from a place of concern for his safety so he\u2019ll hopefully be honest with you.", "NTA But I am really curious how to appropriately handle something like this. My first thought would have been to have him change classes or move to another school district. This might sound really drastic and also requires the means to do so. Not only that, but the latter would also affect the other step children. Therapy is wonderful but with an unwilling participant...no doubt it needs to happen, but I wonder about the effectiveness. Does anybody know how to deal with stuff like this?", "NTA\n\n\nWhat he's doing isn't okay and you've been a parent for him since he was in elementary school. You are some guy. Some guy who chose to love him and be there for him and try to help him grow up into a good person. \n\n\nWhatever he's feeling, it's probably not new, just stronger during this time in his youth. He might open up more with his mother though, based on the things he said.

OP needs to take him to the ghetto where the open market is so he can see the effects....if they don't get assaulted, mugged, or shot at. Like scared straight. Drugs kill!
