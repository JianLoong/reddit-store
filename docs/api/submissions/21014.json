Devastating right. \nI spent two weeks coming to terms with it and now I\u2019m ok and just excited to meet him in general.\nMy surgery is schedule for a late afternoon which means I\u2019ll spend that first evening in the thick of recovery. I\u2019ve asked family other than our other two children and grandmothers to please wait until the next day to visit as that evening I\u2019d like a slow paced intimate recovery time. Literally told my husband the following day on the guest list is open season to whoever he wants! \n\nHe is completely upset with me and thinks I\u2019m selfish for not allowing his siblings (he has 4) and others to visit that very same evening after the c section. He says it\u2019s just a 5 min visit each and I should allow everyone to enjoy the baby. While I get his excitement, we\u2019ve done that the previous two times, it was NEVER only 5 minutes and it was stressful and overwhelming for me. This time given my vbac is not happening and I\u2019ve had to come to terms with a c section in general it\u2019s the one thing I want.\n\nHe swears it\u2019s selfish as if the baby won\u2019t exist the next day?! \n\nSo am I the asshole or what? I think it\u2019s a completely reasonable ask honestly.\n\nTDLR: I want to recover the evening after a c section with our mothers and children only and have visitors the next day.

No one.. and I repeat no one.. should visit someone the day they have abdominal surgery unless it is the spouse. So why do we accept anything less than that for a c-section? Phrase it this way to husband because a c-section is no different than an open abdominal surgery (I\u2019ve had multiple due to crohns and no\u2026 I didn\u2019t want anyone other than my husband at my side so it is no different with a c-section).

After each time my wife gave birth, I couldn't care less if anyone in my family saw our babies right away, I just wanted her to feel safe, comfortable, rest well, and have the most relaxing and restorative post-birth time as possible.", "I've been through major surgery.

And he's calling *you* selfish!??\n\nTell him when he has his abdomen cut open and something removed, he's welcome to have more than a dozen people parade through his hospital room as soon as they wake him up from the surgery, but you're not having it. I can't imagine your doctors would be on board with it either. \n\nNTA", "NTA, you are having a surgery. It\u2019s what you want and very reasonable.

Make an appointment with your ob gyn for you and your husband and have the doctor explain exactly what is going to happen to you. In great detail", "NTA.  You're not even asking for a full day, just, like, 12-14 hours.  Your husband is being incredibly unfair.", "NTA.

Oh goddammit this is flipping all my repressed rage switches. Hell no. You are doing the work and going through the pain, YOU call the shots. Exactly the same damn thing happened when my daughter was born. \u201dElective\u201d repeat caesarean after emergency caesarean for twins. I didn\u2019t want any visitors the day she was born, knowing how difficult the first day had been previously (Vomiting, pain etc.). This was NOT okay for my in-laws- my father-in-law couldn\u2019t possibly defer another golfing holiday for one day so I could recover a bit. My brother in law tore strips off me over the phone for being so unreasonable. It was horrifying. All because I wanted one day to start recovering without having to \u201cperform\u201d. Awful awful awful situation, and sixteen years later I still haven\u2019t completely forgiven them for putting their wants over my welfare. I stood my ground on this, but the fact that his family made such a fucking big deal over a very reasonable request meant that on the day, I was STILL worrying about it. I\u2019m sure it contributed to my postnatal depression.\n\nOP\u2019s husband, keep your extended family in line, and PUT YOUR WIFE\u2019S WELFARE FIRST. She and your newborn should be your priority. Your siblings can have a damn photo and you can talk to them \u201cfor 5 minutes\u201d (times 4) all you like. It\u2019s only 24hrs. Damn.

We went in when my water broke naturally and literally before I left the room to confirm my water broke, my bf's uncle was outside with balloons of congratulations. I was trying to change into my gown when I got to the birthing room. He. Wouldn't. Leave. People mean the best, but birth and recovery isn't a spectator sport. It's your body, it's your room.

And even better you\u2019ll be feeling up to actually meeting them.", "This ISN'T A PARTY, it's major surgery along with all the risks of having a baby. There is no darn reason to have even your kids there that evening. Visitors can wait. I'm an FP trained in cesareans and have had 3 myself. Far too many people think L&D and postpartum are some kind of party. You will have enough people checking your vitals, incision, bleeding, and everything else that goes along with the first 12 hours post-op that extra people just do not need to be there.

After the first I said NO to hospital visitors other than siblings for the first 24 hours and it was the greatest decision ever. It\u2019s your body, your surgery, and your decision.

I don\u2019t know if they\u2019d be receptive of that, but even just a coffee date with all in the morning could be nice. That way there\u2019s a plan, and your husband can maybe come to terms that you just want time to recover? After my first c-section (and they\u2019re all different) it was a challenge to have so many people right there waiting. Also, I had a bad reaction to something and began puking I front of everyone, which I could\u2019ve done without. \n\nThere\u2019s no trophy in seeing or holding a baby less than 24 hours after they\u2019re born."]}
