Like give the people some damn space! I would feel terrible going and barging in on someone who's barely been stitched back up. When my SIL gave birth I didn't see her or my nephew for a week. Even then I felt like it was too soon.", "Not selfish at all. Your head will not be in the game at all and you are right to want a little space. There will be plenty of time for the extended family to meet bubs and waiting until you are ready is not going to hurt anyone.", "NTA.  It's a full surgical procedure that takes 6 weeks to recover from.  I didn't see anyone for a week.", "Ya, it\u2019s you that\u2019s selfish in this scenario\u2026.. NTA.", "nta. you are literally his wife who just had a baby and he is prioritizing his siblings?? you'll be post-op a major procedure and he doesn't think your recovery is important?? blows my mind how someone could have this thought process especially since this the 3rd kid??", "NTA \n\nPersonally I would not be able to handle having any visitors at the hospital. That's way too vulnerable, exposing, physically grueling, with so many different bodily fluids......\n\n......... and he wants spectators!!!!! \n\nHes saying it's more important for his Siblings extended family members to bond with the baby, than you. It's more important for his family to feel comfortable than you. \n\nThat's exactly what hes saying. You need to hand over that intamite critical moment over to the rest of the family, that the fact that your bleeding doesnt matter. The fact that you have felt every kick every moment and that YOU need to meet and get to know this little one first. \n\nHonestly you have every right to not have him in the room either. You need support and comfort in that moment, and if he is not going to do that he doesnt need to be there.", "NTA by any means. Jesus folk dancing christ... honestly, why do people feel the need to see the baby RIGHT FREAKING NOW in the hospital?? That's like the epitomy of main character syndrome, in my opinion anyway. Like, give the new family some time to bond, let them get situated, and then come over, preferably with a meal, hold the baby while mom showers or naps, and be on your merry way. Especially when there's four of you. \n\nOP, you're having the baby. You decide who comes and when. If hubby doesn't like it, passive aggressively stop doing his laundry or only speak to him in Elizabethan English.", "NTA That is major surgery (I've had a c-section myself). This is your decision, not his.", "NTA, I had a scheduled c section (prior back surgery, I was told that pushing might not be an option, scheduled the c section for my piece of mind) in March. No one but my SO was allowed to be at the hospital for 24 hours. Not our parents, siblings, friends. I wanted to get time with my child and wanted the same for my SO. I still get flack for it (from my family, my in-laws were very understanding) but I don\u2019t care. I didn\u2019t want to be trying to figure out how to breastfeed, have a catheter, and not be dressed with other people there. And I\u2019ll do that again for my next pregnancy because I want that time.", "NTA, but your husband is.  He's inconsiderate as hell.  Sheesh.", "NTA- I\u2019m sorry you are going through this. I also wanted a Vbac that didn\u2019t happen. I\u2019m glad you were able to come to terms with it. Be sure to tell the nurses that you do NOT want visitors. They\u2019ll enforce your boundaries for you. Your husband is a jerk. I hope he comes to his senses. Good luck.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nPLEASE tell the nurses/doctors. They can help you keep people out until you're ready. Tell your husband if he can't support you in a sincerely stressful time in keeping your bouny then he can wait with his family.\n\nOr if he insists I'd make it as uncomfortable as possible for him and the visitors. I assume you've already spoken to him about the \"it's never just five minutes, and it's always stressful for me\"\n\nAs someone who has basically the entire family there immediately after birth, I regret it. I know if I had another chance at it, I'd give the same boundaries.", "NTA - even if you didnt have major sugery. People can wait 24h to see the baby. The baby will still be there a few hours later. \nGiving birth is not easy, plaese make it normal for the person who gives birth to make the rules.", "NTA\n\nStand your ground OP. You're not asking for much.", "NTA I was miserable after my 2nd c-section and my father in law took one look at me, told my mother in law to snuggle the baby for a min and say good bye! He was such a blessing. I felt TERRIBLE and wish my own family would have done the same.. and left quickly", "Double NTA : \n\nJust shared this with my husband (I\u2019ve had an emergency and planned c section) and his response was \u201cNOPE. absolutely not. Surprised she\u2019s even allowing grandparents.\u201d", "NTA... Your request is completely reasonable.  You even know the timing of your birth so they can schedule their time. You know how you feel after and you want to do it better this time\n\nYour husband is being an AH. His job is to support you as you go through this physical and mental health procedure.  Your husband is failing to do his job.", "NTA. Ban him too and save day 2 just for your divorce attorney", "NTA. Are you sure you like being married to this person lol?", "Good lord. NTA 1000x over. \n\nIs your husband regularly this dismissive of your wishes in matters that intimately concern you? \n\nThis is an alarming level of disregard.", "NTA. It\u2019s an entirely reasonable ask.\n\nMake sure the hospital knows you want no visitors on day 1. You should probably put husband on that list or he will bring them anyway and say \u201cthey\u2019re with me\u201d.", "NTA\n\nSeriously, what is it with men not understanding how difficult labour and delivery are? A c-section is a major surgery! You deserve rest.", "NTA His siblings can enjoy the baby the next day.", "There are even [animated videos](https://youtu.be/pSJcxYg1QQ4) on YouTube with a doctor explaining. If after watching a clip showing how half dozen layers of his wife\u2019s abdomen will be slit, multiple organs pushed out of the way, her spine will be injected\u2026 all this and he still insists it\u2019s a minor procedure, then he is not a supportive person to have during the delivery and OP should find another birth partner.", ">Awful awful awful situation, and sixteen years later I still haven\u2019t completely forgiven them for putting their wants over my welfare. I stood my ground on this, but the fact that his family made such a fucking big deal over a very reasonable request meant that on the day, I was STILL worrying about it. I\u2019m sure it contributed to my postnatal depression. \n\nOMG twins! I had a fairly easy birth, with one baby,  but I failed to set a boundary for visiting ILs (and my husband was unable to deal) and it me things really hard. I don't think I ever really got over it. \n\n>I am incandescent with anger on your behalf\nSame", "Offer for him to enjoy some exploratory abdominal surgery before greeting his family and he then can show off the baby. I'm happy to lend you some implements for this, sorry if they're a little rusty.", "Ask him why his siblings are more important to him than you, his WIFE, who will have just had major surgery.  Tell him to consider his answer very, very carefully.", "This is a boundary you need to set in stone.", "Oh no, he gets his abdomen sliced open and his organs rearranged, so he can get the full experience. Then he can entertain visitors since it's no big deal."]}
