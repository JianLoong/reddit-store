But you were right to make your position clear. NOTHING WRONG with declining.", "NTA   \nwtf why would they even think so with out discussing it first.  A kid is not a toy", "NTA. It is understandable for you to be caught off guard and feel uncomfortable when presented with such a big responsibility without prior discussion or agreement. It's not fair for your friend and his wife to assume that you would be willing to take on legal guardianship without your consent. It's important to have open and honest communication when it comes to important decisions like this, and it's okay to express your concerns and preferences. It's not insensitive to prioritize your own well-being and to want to have a say in such an important decision.", "INFO:\n\n<< I was sitting down with Valera and she said that her and Max have dicussed me taking over legal guardianship over their 3 year old \"Kimmy\" if they were to perish and they like the idea.

From this it seems as though they were in the discussion stage of the \"Who should take our child if we die\" determination. They asked you if you were into it. It seems that they DID discuss it with you before taking any concrete steps.", "INFO: Did they actually put you down as legal guardian in their will already? They way you wrote it, it sounds like they have just been discussing it amongst themselves and decided it was time to discuss it with you as a possibility, and you kind of panicked because you didn\u2019t expect it.", "Your taking care of your friend's wife does not mean you are wanting to be their child's parent. I'm horrified for you that this even came up. The tumor is benign and while a health scare is a good reason to put things in order 'just in case', you did not sign up to be a possible parent. Asking a person/couple to be a godparent and guardian is a very serious question and needs the full agreement of every adult involved. Just because you are a good person and they 'like the idea' of you taking their child doesn't obligate you in the slightest, and being honest in a situation like this is required so there's no assumptions or confusion further down the line. NTA.", "NAH\n\nThat is a HUGE responsibility and one that you have clearly told them you weren't comfortable with.\n\nIf I was Max or Valera, I wouldn't want to give the guardianship of my child to someone who clearly didn't want it.\n\nNTA OP, you have been a very good friend, taking over all these things for your friends in a time of need, but you don't owe them this. This is a huge deal that definitely should have been atleast discussed with you, but this was them discussing it with you.\n\nThey didn't say that they have decided on it, they said they have discussed about this, and now are talking to you about this. You are not TA for not wanting to take on the role of the legal guardian but they aren't the AH either as they were just letting you know that they thought about this, nothing was set in stone.\n\nEDIT: Typo", "INFO: did they already put you down as emergency guardian, or was this still up for discussion?", ">I was sitting down with Valera and she said that her and Max have dicussed me taking over legal guardianship over their 3 year old\n\n>why didnt they dicusss this with me\n\nWhat the fuck else do you call what they did, if not discussing it with you? They didn't hand you signed papers, they started a conversation with you. They tried to have a discussion with you.", "We always tell clients to ask whether their proposed executors and guardians are willing to take on the job. \n\nHaving said that, circumstances change.

They have not formalised anything, but was actually talking to you about them having discussed you being their first choice.", "I\u2019m confused\u2014they asked you and you said no? Or did they drop the kid off at your house assuming you would take over responsibility? \n\n\nThe way you stated it, it sounds like they asked and you said no. I don\u2019t see the problem here?", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s completely okay that you don\u2019t want to be the legal guardian of a kid. I know the possibility of both of them dying is very small, but you need to be 100% sure you could and want to take in the kid before agreeing to be their \u2018what if\u2019 candidate.\n\nIt\u2019s not mean or insensitive to say no to that. \n\nAgreeing to that is not a favour, it\u2019s a big, life changing commitment, and it\u2019s absurd she just sprung it on you like that. \n\nI get that a health scare can change the way you see life, and I think it\u2019s a very good idea they\u2019re talking about whom to name guardian, but no one has to say yes to that. \n\nI mean we\u2019re talking about taking in a traumatised kid!", "NTA for saying that you didn't agree to this, but it does sound like they were discussing it with you.", "Based on your comments to people asking for information, I\u2019m going with NTA.", "YTA\n\nThey *were* discussing it with you first!  \n\nHow much earlier do you think you should have been involved in the discussion? Before they\u2019d talked with each other?", "YTA because they were discussing it with you, and you could have just said no. It's not like anything had already happened without your consent.", "NTA. To me they should have discussed this with you. Its your life it would affect if it happened. You would be expected to put your future on hold, pay for and take care of a child that you have had no hand in raising so far. \n\nWhile they are probably good people and are your friends, they really should of reached out to you first when the discussion first started between max and valeria. They cannot make decisions on a possible future for you when you are not even involved with the decision.", "This is kind of a tough one, because you were totally caught off guard with their request. They were not wrong in discussing between themselves who they would want to care for their child should they die while she is a minor. But they could have presented it to you in a much better way. For example, a better way to have presented this to you would have been to say, \"Max and I have been discussing who we want to take care of our daughter should we die when she is a minor and your name made it onto our list of possible people. Is this something that you would be interested in?\" I think if she had presented it to you that way, you would not have freaked out as much as you did. I think it would help your relationship with your friends if you go back to Valerie and Max, and tell them that while you value their friendship and are honored to have been considered a worthy candidate, taking care of their minor child is not something that you personally are comfortable with and that you hope they understand. Therefore I'm going to say NAH.", "NAH \n\nA highly emotional topic often leads to miscommunication. It sounds like you felt put on the spot and caught off guard and reacted more harshly than you meant. It sounds like they thought you would be honored and were surprised and disappointed by your response, on top of feeling scared for the future of their child.\n\nTell them it was unexpected and that you felt put on the spot and pressured because you do feel for them and really do want to help, but agreeing to take guardianship of a child just isn't something you can sign up for right now... Or something along those lines.", "INFO - they said they discussed it, and you think they needed permission from you to discuss it with each other? That makes no sense.\n\nIf they duscussed it and they like the idea, that is when it is appropriate to ask you what you think. If at that point you were all like \"omg why are you doing this I didnt agree to that\" then yeah, YTA.\n\nHowever, if they came to you as if it was a done deal and you were getting the kid... then NTA. That is incredibly presumtious.", "NTA. This is something that needs to be thoroughly discussed and agreed upon. To just let you know you get a kid if something happens to them, without talking about it with you, is presumptuous on their part.", "YTA a little. They ARE talking to you. You could have just said no.", "INFO:  was your response \"No\" after telling you didn't agree to this or \"I need time to decide taking this responsibility\"", "I'm going to say NAH - I'd say her telling you that they talked about it and like the idea *was* her coming to talk about it with you. Of course they discussed it between them first, it would be weird if the idea came up and they immediately called you to suggest it.\n\nYou have every right to say no if it's something you're adamantly against, of course.", "You missed an opportunity to get close with Valera.", "YTA shouldve taken the deal and let things be", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
