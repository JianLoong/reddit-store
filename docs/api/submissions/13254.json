Asking a person/couple to be a godparent and guardian is a very serious question and needs the full agreement of every adult involved.

Is this something that you would be interested in?\" I think if she had presented it to you that way, you would not have freaked out as much as you did. I think it would help your relationship with your friends if you go back to Valerie and Max, and tell them that while you value their friendship and are honored to have been considered a worthy candidate, taking care of their minor child is not something that you personally are comfortable with and that you hope they understand.

But there were NOT, as confirmed in a comment OP made hours ago: \n\n>[No they way they saying it was like hey you're gonna be the guardian we've already decided](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/122u4bg/aita_for_saying_i_didnt_agree_to_this/jdrt581/)", "Oh thank god. One of my cousins has like 5 kids and said they wanted me to be their guardian and I said \u201cNO\u201d.  They are the most misbehaving little things on the planet, right next to my three legged chihuahua.", "NTA\n\nI would distance yourself from them. If they are TELLING you what to do instead of politely requesting and then immediately backing down, they are getting very entitled of your time and money.", "Your choice. Only you know if you have what it takes to care for a child. Some people can\u2019t, for life  or personal reasons. But they clearly have the ultimate trust and respect for you, to think you\u2019re the best person for-the job.", "NTA, did they even ask if you want kids?!? That\u2019s a huge thing to throw at someone.", "Nta", "ESH", "NAH, honestly.  This may have been the beginning of the discussion for them, but it may not have been done how you liked it.  No papers were signed, etc.  They're probably very grateful for your help and were glad to see someone care for their child.  They're also coming off a very emotional experience, so maybe give them a little grace.", "NTA. Super weird thing to just declare", "You\u2019re the asshole but not because you don\u2019t want guardianship of Kimmy but because of the way you said it.  From their point of view they are showing how much they care for and trust you and you just blew them off.  A better response would have been something along the lines of \u201cI absolutely adore Kimmy but would be incredibly sad if the situation were to occur where I would need to take her in.  Thank you so much for the trust you\u2019ve shown in me.  I have never thought about raising a child.  Would it be possible to take some time to think about it?  I\u2019d like to make sure I\u2019d be the best person to love her like she deserves.\u201d  Then after you\u2019ve taken a week or so you could let them down gently.", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA. When my husband and I set up guardianship provisions in our will when we were expecting our first, we discussed with those people DIRECTLY before putting them down, asked if they would be comfortable with it, explained how much would be set aside in trust for our children, etc. \n\nCan't just surprise people with that \ud83d\ude36", "NTA", "NTA.  You can't just assume people have the means or desire to become a parent without even talking to them about it first.", "INFO: OP, how comfortable are you at holding your boundaries?\n\nReading your comments this sounds like you might be taking what was supposed to be a conversation as an announcement because you're not usually comfortable saying no...", "It sounds like they were TRYING to discuss this with you first? You said yourself Valeria broached the topic by saying they talked about naming you guardian should the worst happen and they both agreed that they liked the idea, **not that they had named you guardian!** How the hell else are they SUPPOSED to get around to asking if you'd be okay with it except to FIRST broach the subject by telling you that they Trust you enough to consider you for that role!!\n\nYTA for getting all up in arms instead of actually having the damned discussion!! It would have been fine if you'd said something like \"Wow, I'd never thought of myself as raising a child. I'm honored that you would be comfortable having me as guardian. But....\" and then either given a polite no, or asked for time to think it over before agreeing. Or asking some intellingent and mature questions about what they envision, or who else they have in mind...you know, like an adult?\n\nWow. Just Wow.  You know, on second thought, maybe it's best that you showed just how immature and unsuited for raising their child that you actually are!  I hope there is someone else in their lives more capable.", "NTA- I don\u2019t even want kids of my own, I wouldn\u2019t want others as well.", "I think the problem is they didn't ask her. They told her. You ask. You just don't tell someone I want to you to  keep my kid if we die. She probably freaked. And said I didn't agree to that! They probably love her and think she is good person. But we need to handle things better.", "NTA, though it sounds like you may not understand all the legal details about this. Even if they have already put this into their wills or whatever, they cannot legally force you to become a child's guardian. You can just say no. You should make it VERY VERY clear to them that you WILL say no in the event something happens, so they can find someone else who may actually want to do this.", "I agree with you. Based on the post, it sounds like they are mad their friends didn\u2019t discuss potential guardianship with OP\u2026.but that\u2019s exactly what it sounds like they were doing.\n\nOP Def has the right to decline, and the friends can feel sad about it. Hopefully they can work through it.", "No, Max and Valera are not the assholes because they discussed it beforehand, they are assholes because when OP was not comfortable with it, they called OP insensitive.\n\nNTA.", "Looks like the way this couple brought it up was not a discussion, just telling him what they decided.\n\nFrom OP:\n\n\u201c No they way they saying it was like hey you're gonna be the guardian we've already decided\u201d", "God parent is nothing to do with legal guardian responsibilities.", "In your own words, you said they hadn\u2019t gone through any legal formalities to actually make you guardian. Which means they were discussing it with you. A lot of people (and yourself) are jumping through hoops to make this sound like it wasn\u2019t a \u201cdiscussion,\u201d but the actual circumstances indicate it was. Obviously you can say no, but your comments insisting that there was no discussion is weird.", "I might be missing something, but I don't think they were responding to her \"no\", as much as they were responding to her shocked reaction to \"they liked the idea\" of her being the kid's guardian in the event of an untimely death or other similar event. They said OP's reaction was insensitive, and from what OP has written, that's quite probably true.\n\nOP's chief complaint is that guardianship was a done deal without consulting her, even as they were consulting her. They may have been unjustifiably confident that OP would agree, but all OP needed to do was say \"Hang on, this is big, I need time to think about it.\"\n\nHow could it be a done deal at this stage? Even should OP agree, and then the worst occur, OP can still say no.", "Nope, you can list anyone in your will, whether they actually accept or just say no when the time comes is another thing.", "What about the part where it says \"I didn't agree to this and she started to cry\"\n\nRegardless if she said what you put in the second paragraph, she will still cry and the husband will call her insensitive and an asshole. Basically not changing anything from where we are now", "Gotta love Aunt Marge", "Of course, I never said otherwise. \n\nThe issue is that it needs to be far more than just \"talk to OP\" after they discuss it themselves. They need to have a real discussion with OP, which involves not only asking her if she is interested/capable/willing etc. but also getting her thoughts and having a back and forth discussion on the matter. That didn't happen, [they just told her she was going to be the guardian as they had already decided for her](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/122u4bg/aita_for_saying_i_didnt_agree_to_this/jdrt581/).", "It read to me like that was the goal, but they weren't able to even get through the opening. Step 1: Hey, we want you guys to be the guardians if we die on the highway. Step 2: How do you feel about that? Is that cool? The post came across like Step 1 was barely on the wind and OP immediately freaked the fuck out.", "The way OP wrote this, I read it as they made a potentially life changing decision FOR her, without consulting her. Then when her reality didn\u2019t match their fantasy, she was called out for not following the script. \n\nMy late husband and I as well as my daughters and grandkids, all had this discussion with the choices we felt were good and were OK with whatever the answer was.  NO WAY was anything mentioned to anyone until we had made our first, second, etc choices.  \n\nClearly NTA", "Originally I thought that could be the case too, but nope. From a comment of OP:\n\n>[No they way they saying it was like hey you're gonna be the guardian we've already decided](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/122u4bg/aita_for_saying_i_didnt_agree_to_this/jdrt581/)", "NTA. They need to ask for your permission.", "I asked my own siblings if they would be willing and understood if they said no. Raising children is a huge commitment and should only be done by someone who is ready and willing to do so. They approached this incorrectly. They should have asked and accepted your response. NTA.", "You have to be consulted in advance.", "NTA. Husband and I had 4 children. There is no way I would have put had someone in line for guardianship of my children without having had many discussions about it prior to making out the documents. The very first discussion would be whether or not they would even be interested or able to fill the roles. What were these people thinking of?", "It sounds like this WAS discussing it with you.\nThis was her bringing you into the discussion to see how you felt.\n\n They didn't file.paperwork, make you the guardian... They DISCUSSED it, and since they were.onntje same page, it was time to bring it up with you.\n\nUnless I'm missing something, you're response was hugely misplaced. You could have easily said \"I'm so flattered you would think of.me.with so much trust. I don't think that would make sense... But I'm honored.\"\n\nInstead you were outraged? Offended? That they what, DISCUSSED the idea?\n\nUnless you missed a detail,.OP, yes, YTA... Not for saying no but for acting like they'd somehow done you wrong by discussing the idea.", "Not sure what I'm missing, but it sounds like they are discussing it with you.  Or are you saying they already filed new wills/trusts/documents stating you'ld be the guardian?  Based on the information presented, NAH.", "NTA. You do NOT land something like that on someone without asking.", "NAH\nThey discussed it then wanted to discuss it with you. You said he\u2019ll no before it even got past step 1 of telling you they\u2019d been discussing it. \nNo problems with them asking, no problem with you saying no. It sounds like you panicked at the idea which is a valid response to me.", "NAH.  Of course they're going to talk with each other before they broach the subject with you.  That's what parents do when they have to make these decisions.\n\nAs for discussing it with you, that's literally what they were trying to do when you panicked.  I'm sorry, but that's what you did.  You panicked.  I don't blame you, I might panic in the same situation.  A calm response to what they seemed to say would be something like \"let me think about it for awhile.\"  But also, panic is a very honest reaction and it's yours and you have a right to it..\n\nThat said, I think your response made it pretty clear that you weren't OK with the idea or ready to seriously consider it and rather than getting defensive or trying to call you out on it Max and Valeria really should have just let the matter drop.  They broached the subject, asked you for your thoughts, you gave them your thoughts in the form of a panicked outburst, they need to accept that and move on.\n\nI don't think either side is AH.  Neither side did a great job of communicating but at the end of the day, honestly was had and clarity was reached.  you aren't ready to assume the role of designated guardian.  They have their answer.  Now they need to deal with that.", "NTA. Who just dumps a potential kid on someone?!", "It sounds like that was her way of discussing it with you. I'm assuming she didn't hand over legal papers for you to sign.", "NTA-they didn't discuss this with you, it sounded like they decided on it before even asking you and were letting you know instead of asking. you have every right to refuse taking guardianship over a literal child if you don't want to and aren't comfortable with it.", "NTA\n\nYou ask someone if they would be willing to take on that responsibility. You don't shove it on them. You have to find someone who would be willing to take that responsibility.", "NTA. Taking care of someone else\u2019s kid is not an easy decision to make and is a lot of responsibility. She should have discussed it with you before discussing it with her husband.", "NTA to disagree with it but I don't think they were just throwing it on you, it sounds like this WAS her coming to you to discuss whether or not it's an option.  Of course as a couple they were going to talk about it among themselves first, to make sure they were on the same page before approaching you.", "Nta but i think you missed the part where that was supposed to be her discussing it with you. Of course they would need to talk privately & come up with a person they both agree on & what they would want to happen before discussing it with anyone. Would be awkward otherwise. Esp if one had a valid reason they didn't want the person", "NTA\n\nYou don't give a burden like this to someone without their permission.", "YTA- that was literally them discussing it with you and your reaction was over the top. A proper reaction would be something like \u201cI really appreciate the trust you have in me although I don\u2019t think I can take on that type of responsibility at this time\u201d", "They \\*did\\* discuss it between themselves, agreed they would approach OP, and then raised it with her. This is how you make big decisions.  It's not like they said, \"Hey guess what - we've appointed you guardian in our will!\"  OP is entirely within her rights to say \"no\", but to suggest that they \"threw\" this on her is ridiculous. They asked. They didn't respond well when she said no.  ESH.", "This was the part where they were trying to discuss it. They were wanting OP\u2019s thoughts on if they\u2019d be willing. OP just flipped out/", "Max and Valera's account found.", "Yeah, planning to *soon* as in *if you agreed* which is why she was bringing it up- she wanted to know your stance. And you *flew off the handle*.", "No,.they discussed it with each other, and now that they have confirmed.theu are on the same page, they are discussing it with OP.\n\nThey don't discuss the idea with a third party until they're in agreement there's a reason to.\n\nOP is ACTING like they filed papers and it's a done deal. This WAS a discussion.", "NTA. No they did it right. You expect them to ask first and then discuss it between themselves? The couple discussed it between themselves as to who they would both like and then they ask said person. \n\nShe just had a knee jerk reaction and freaked out. Chances of both parents dying before the kid turns 18 is small but real.", "It matters because this isn't a legality sub. It's a sub to determine who's TAH, and making decision for OP is an AH move.", "Right so you agree that OPs original post was misleading and required clarification."]}
