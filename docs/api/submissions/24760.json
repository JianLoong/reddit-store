I love babysitting my nephew, so this isn\u2019t odd, so I loaded up Monsters Inc. [his favorite movie] while I waited.\n\nWhen they got here, he was crying his eyes out, and she had very clearly been crying and looked Pissed. I got him all situated on the couch inside, and told him I\u2019d be right back.\n\nWhen I got back outside to talk to her, she told me about everything that had happened. Apparently, she found out my BIL [27M], who works from home, had been cheating on her for \u201cgod knows how long\u201d while she was away at work. He would have the woman over while she wasn\u2019t home. Now, the kicker is, since my nephew\u2019s pre-k doesn\u2019t start for a few more days, he\u2019s been watching him at home. When he has his side-piece over. Yeah.\n\nNow, my sister is great, but she is very quick to jump to conclusions, especially when she\u2019s stressed out. When she asked my nephew if he knew about a lady coming over when mommy wasn\u2019t home, he said he knew. Then, she immediately thought that her son was purposefully keeping it a secret.\n\nNaturally, I told her I\u2019m very sorry that this is happening, and I want to help her get through this, but that she can\u2019t possibly be blaming her FOUR YEAR OLD SON for keeping his father\u2019s cheating a secret. He\u2019s four. I told her she\u2019s directing her anger at the wrong person, and she has absolutely no reason to be mad at a literal child who doesn\u2019t even understand what\u2019s wrong.\n\nShe started yelling at me, telling me I\u2019m an asshole for taking her husband\u2019s side and not supporting her. She started to get in her car, and I just let her, figuring I\u2019d give her time to cool down and process all that\u2019s happened.\n\nI hate cheaters, I think it\u2019s horrible to cheat on your partner, and I am NOT taking the side of my [ex?] BIL. I am defending a little boy who did absolutely nothing wrong. If he was older, like 15, I\u2019d understand her anger, but he\u2019s not 15. He\u2019s 4.\n\n\nI just got him layed down a little while ago, and I\u2019m sitting here thinking about everything that\u2019s happened and wondering what I should do. My parents aren\u2019t gonna be home until tomorrow night, out of town for a wedding, and I don\u2019t know what to do. Should I have comforted her more? Should I have focused on her and not my nephew? Should I have done more? Am I an asshole for defending him and letting her leave still upset? I don\u2019t know. All I know is that I don\u2019t want this little boy believing even for a second that he\u2019s done something wrong, or that he\u2019s the reason mommy and daddy are fighting. He\u2019s just a kid.\n\nSo, AITA for defending my nephew?", "created_utc": 1692154610, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15sdj7l/aita_for_defending_my_nephew/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You did absolutely the right thing by defending your nephew and making sure he isn't unfairly blamed or burdened with a situation he couldn't possibly comprehend. It's unfortunate that your sister is going through a difficult time, but directing her anger at a 4-year-old child is not fair or appropriate.\n\nYou were in a difficult position, and it's clear you care for both your sister and your nephew. Comforting your sister is important too, but not at the expense of unfairly blaming a child who had no role in the situation. Your priority should be ensuring your nephew feels loved, safe, and supported during this confusing time.\n\nYou should give your sister some space to process her emotions, but when she's ready to talk, calmly explain your perspective. Let her know that you're not taking sides but simply standing up for the well-being of your nephew. Encourage open communication so that the focus can shift from misplaced blame to dealing with the actual issues at hand.\n\nRemember, your intention was to protect an innocent child, and that's a commendable thing to do. Your nephew needs your support and understanding, and it's important to ensure that he doesn't internalize any false sense of guilt or responsibility.", "NTA that poor child. This is a core memory now.", "Nta.  Good for you!  He's 4! He didn't intentionally keep a secret.  She is absolutely projecting her anger into a defenseless baby instead of at the person she should be mad at: bil.  Good for you for trying to talk since sense into her", "NTA. You did the right thing by defending your nephew. It's clear that he's just a child and isn't responsible for the situation. You showed empathy and support by focusing on the well-being of the innocent child rather than taking sides between your sister and her husband. It's understandable that your sister is upset, but directing her anger at her young son isn't fair or productive. Your priority was ensuring the child's emotional safety, which is commendable.", "NTA. And I hope you show your sister your post and the responses.\n\nYour Nephew is 4 and does not understand the concept of marriage, sex or cheating. He probably wouldn't say anything to your sister until he's maybe 6.. something along the lines of \"daddy's friend came over today\". But still wouldn't understand the concept of cheating.", "NTA. not the kid fault at all, he\u2019s only 4.", "NTA. That poor child, he did nothing wrong. How was he supposed to know that she *didn\u2019t* know?\n\nI hope he doesn\u2019t grow up thinking it\u2019s his fault if they split up because his mom exploded on him like that after finding out about the cheating.", "NTA at all. The kid might be more traumatized than the mom at this point. \n\nIt sounds like she wasn't in a position to be comforted and dragging out the argument would raise her adrenaline levels even more. I think you did this absolutely right, especially considering this was all improvised. Good uncle. And you're only 17. That's impressive.", "NTA, but your sister is very emotional right now so it makes sense if she\u2019s not thinking straight. Hopefully she apologizes when she calms down", "Thank you for having a your nephew's back.\n\nHe is likely to be in a whirlwind soon.  Having at least one calm adult he can rely on is going helpful.\n\nNTA", "NTA, he needed someone to stand up for her at the time. Hopefully when your sister calms down she'll realize how ridiculous it is to get mad at him. She's hurt at the moment and doesn't know how to direct it yet. Give her time to process it all.", "Absolutely NTA. That poor little boy. Luckily he has an auntie like you to reassure him, comfort him, and give him the support he needs. \n\nAs for your sister\u2026 she cannot possibly think a 4 year old was harboring a secret of that magnitude on purpose. She\u2019s upset. She needs time. And then hopefully she will realizes what an AH she was to her son.", "NTA how is a child supposed to understand adult relationship dynamics? she is just lashing out", "NTA . He did nothing wrong and should not be blamed. She\u2019s just really upset right now, angry and not thinking clearly  and  will come to her senses about her son. Maybe call her and let her vent to you. All you can do is be there to support her", "NTA. Probably the only lesson is when someone's upset, for whatever reason, intense emotions block rational thought so if they say something a bit wild, try to let it go and hopefully they'll forget it. If they end up arguing it, they're likely to remember and defend it for eternity. Raise it for discussion, if necessary, when they've cooled down.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Kids do not understand when something is wrong. I was seven and my dad had a friend who acted inappropriately towards me. I did not understand that it was wrong then. I was just a child.\n\nShe should be angry not just because of the cheating but because this means he left a literal toddler alone to put a notch in the marital bed.\n\nHow the crap is a kid supposed to know a specific friend over for daddy is bad?\n\nI think too, that it is a bit of misplaced aggression. She is struggling to accept what is happening, so something else has to be a problem, too.\n\nYou are completely in the right here.", "Nta. Let's hope your sister gets therapy cause once she goes down the path of putting blame on an actual child who's innocent in this it'll get worse with time. She's clearly stressed and hurt so maybe after she calms off you should talk to her til then maybe try to keep your nephew for a few days so she doesn't take anger out on him. Edit to add, have him play Tetris studies have shown it helps reduce the onset of PTSD. Maybe even try candy crush if Tetris is too hard can work cause the games are addicting and keep attention on them. Slowly try to get him to talk about what his mom said and even if he doesn't it's okay just tell him that nothing is his fault and his mom is just upset right now but she still loves him.", "Nta how is a 4 year old suppose to know what cheating is. A 4 year old barley knows how to count. Some 4 year olds still are being potty trained. Your sister is blaming a child that barely understands basic concepts for her shitty husbands cheating. He probably didn't even know it was wrong. For him to know it was wrong he would need to know how relationships work, what sex is, what infidelity is, and that the other women and his father are having sex. How many hurdles did your 22 year old sister jump to blame her 4 year old son for not telling her. He doesn't even know what's going on like come on. \n\nYes your sister is going through a hard time but she can't be serious. How shitty of a mother do you have to be to put your frustrations and blame on a 4 year old. She's lucky he's young and can still learn to trust because she could do some serious damage to him if she continues to blame the child for something he has not concept/or understanding for. \n\nNta you are awesome though. I would have smacked the shit out of my sister if she said that. Because if you that dumb you deserve the Sense beaten into you blaming 4 year.  Like what the hell. I don't care how grief stricken you are you do not blame a 4 year old for something they didn't do. He didn't hide it he didn't know whats going on or it was bad. Your sister needs some help because of that's how she acts she shouldn't be around that baby. She's lucky I'm not her sibling I wouldn't have been as nice.\n\nYou keep defending him because he needs someone that's on his side. He needs to be loved in this tough time not treated like he's done something wrong. His family is going to be torn apart and is being blamed by his own mother. The scares that will leave that poor child. You are the best uncle. If your sister didn't act like this she could have had so much support but I personally couldn't be on either hers or her soon to be ex's side just the nephews.\n\nEdit: this might be a 1 off thing but keep an eye out this is how a lot of abuse starts. It could become physical or mental in the future not saying she will do this but this is how it starts a lot of the time.", "NTA - it\u2019s wrong of her to even ask anything beyond \u201chas daddy had any friends over\u201d in the most nonchalant way. You never put your kids in the middle of an issue between parents, especially an adult issue like cheating. It\u2019s completely inappropriate. A 4 year old\u2019s life should be worry free. She should be trying to mitigate the damage her her husband has done to her child, not blaming him for it. Poor little guy.", "NTA\n\nYou said it yourself: He's not 15, he's 4. He's a little boy who did absolutely nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\nHe's **FOUR** for craps sake!", "This, but I would take a side. You're on her side against her cheating husband. You're also on your nephew's side against her cheating husband who put him in an awful position that he didn't understand that led to his mother being angry at him for not meeting unspoken and unreasonable expectations. He's 4, he doesn't understand monogamy so he wouldn't know it was information to share with mom. He shouldn't have been put in that position by his dad, and it's not an appropriateexpectation for him to grasp the situation and recognise the relevant info to share. But now mom is angry at dad and him and he doesn't - and can't - understand why.\n\nChildren at that age are egocentric so he likely thinks their fights are about him. That's been cemented by mom's anger being directed at him. She needs to walk it back with him asap and provide a lot of reassurance, especially as he's about to face some huge changes in his home dynamic. She needs to talk to a child therapist to get the reality check about her expectations and also to get guidance on how to help her kid cope with what comes next for their family. She's obviously not well educated yet on how to handle her child's needs in this situation and it's a very impactful time. \n\nNTA and good on you for being a safe adult for your nephew. He needs it now more than ever.", "Yea to all of this. \n\nOP, NTA", "I know he\u2019ll always remember this, I can\u2019t imagine how he wouldn\u2019t, and I don\u2019t know what my sister said to him before he got here, but I\u2019m really hoping I can help ease him through this, and make it as easy as possible, if I can.", "I hope so too. I\u2019ll do everything I can to make sure he never thinks that.", "Thank you. I\u2019m trying to keep a level head, and my only thought these past few hours was to stay calm for him, and distract him from what\u2019s going on.", "Nah it doesn't make sense to make s 4 year old feel like it's there fault that there family is falling a part. I don't care if she's having a hard time. She doesn't get a pass on doing that type of damage to a 4 year old.", "Yup I was gonna write the same thing, except you did it better.", "To be honest, I think that\u2019s the scariest part. I just turned 17, I won\u2019t be an adult for another year, am I even equipped to help him out the way he needs?", "It sucks because one of the major parts of child development is that for the first few years (and definitely when you\u2019re four) you literally CANNOT understand that you are not the centre of everything, just because you\u2019re the centre of your own experiences. The realization that other people are entire entities within their own minds and bodies, acting upon their own desires, isn\u2019t something our brains develop the capacity for until we are much older. I think most kids struggle with the realization that everything is not all about them around 5-6 iirc.\n\nSo especially after his mom planted the seed in his head that he is partly to blame for this, it\u2019s going to be DAMN hard to convince him that this whole thing that may end up altering his entire reality if his parents divorce *isn\u2019t* about him. Especially when it\u2019s him that will keep them tied together to coparent and never be able to move on from one another, he will be the crucible of all their fights and it\u2019s just all going to get internalized.\n\nThis kid needs therapy, man. Idk if that\u2019s something you can help with tho.", "please send your sis a link to this post. \n\nher child is at a critical stage of development and she can do shit that will fuck him up for life if she keeps projecting her shit on him.", "If you love him,  if you are there for him, If you listen to him when he wants to talk,  you will be doing your best.\n\nIts hard to tell right now, but some kids go to therapy.  Not sure if he will need it.  There are too many unknowns.\n\nSometimes just being there,, being the safe place in the storm, is what a child needs.", "Well, lucky for me, I want to major in psychology. Will I work with children? No. Will I take him as a patient? Maybe. But above all else, even in a non-professional setting, maybe I\u2019ll be able to help him work through it with what I learn. I just wanna help, man.", "Thank you. I\u2019ll try my best to be stable for him.", "It\u2019s really great that he has you in his life. You\u2019re a good person. I wish you both luck", "Good luck.", "Thank you. I hope, if it all goes to shit, I\u2019ll be able to protect him."]}
