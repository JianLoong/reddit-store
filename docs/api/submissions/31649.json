I\u2019ve had to set that boundary with a sibling.", "NTA - As heartbreaking as miscarriages are I know that you were trying to remind her that she has six children already and that that in itself is a blessing. I get the feeling that you're sharing more information with us than what you said in the actual conversation. Regardless of the motive you were just trying to turn her attention to her small town of a family. As far as finances go I wouldn't loan her money, instead, if she's struggling to buy food, clothes etc then go shopping with her and pay if she really needs it. But always be sure that she knows you're only doing it for the wellbeing of her children. I don't approve of her turning her eldest into a care taker for the others, please make sure that girls doing okay. It's abusive and neglectful to have a child raise their siblings and is a clear sign that you're absolutely correct in pointing out that she has more than enough children already. I don't know what possesses people to bring children into this world that they can't support, it's irresponsible and you shouldn't have to pick up all the pieces.", "Your sister might decide enough is enough if it isn't financially viable. You loaning her money multiple times is just enabling her.", "NTA\n\nYou probably should've said this after child 4 or 5, not after a miscarriage. \n\nBut you are right. If you need your kids to raise your kids, then you have too many kids.", "NTA.  Sometimes things just have to be said. Even if the timing is unfortunate. It's very sad she had a miscarriage, of course. But when are you going to say it? will you wait until she gets pregnant again?  \nHopefully it will sink in somehow that they already have more kids than they can afford, and are having to ask for money from you or others(?--or maybe just you?).", "It may be a controversial opinion, but I believe that, while the parents\u2019 pain over a miscarriage must be acknowledged and discussed and taken seriously, there\u2019s too much stigma around this. Miscarriages in the first 2-3 months are extremely common; miscarriages can happen so early that a pregnancy is not even identified. Parents are usually so aware of the possibility of a miscarriage that most wait over 12 weeks to share the happy news with friends and family.\r\n\nI mention this because I\u2019ve seen some comments here suggesting OP\u2019s sister \u201clost a baby\u201d. Comments like this, IMO, perpetuate the idea that the grieving process that results from a miscarriage is equal to losing a baby when a pregnancy that\u2019s carried full term \u2013 if, god forbid, the child is stillborn, or dies from SIDS. \r\n\nThe way people comfort parents that go such tragedies is not the same. It\u2019s not uncommon, as OP said in a comment, to acknowledge a miscarriage as a sad situation, yet remind the parents that these things are not uncommon and unfortunately happen, and that the parents can always try again. The \u201ctry again\u201d part is not something you\u2019d usually say immediately when comforting someone whose baby was a stillborn or lost to SIDS in the first months of life. Here, there\u2019s a clear understanding that another child, either already part of the family or still to be conceived, can\u2019t never replace the one that was lost. When talking about a miscarriage, bringing up the other children as a source of comfort is, IMO, acceptable.\r\n\nSo NTA.", "NTA, she has no business having a baby she can't provide for.

Love bombing, bringing you into the fold, forcing \"authentic and connected experiences\" through the techniques they employ, and then the echo chambers, the small groups, the home churches, weave in their more fringe beliefs; evolution is false, multiply upon the earth, women are meant to be subservient to men and are conditioned to see their oppression as holy and their misgivings as demonic, etc. Getting indoctrinated in extreme religious dogma involves a level of secret keeping by those in the group, and presenting a whole different image and watered down message to those not yet \"in\".

One was a relief and the other was a neutral experience. Am i vile for not being devastated? Fuck no.

Idk why you're acting like the broader view of an issue is separate from individual views, especially when that view minimizes the suffering of hurting individuals.", "Maybe because you are trying to dismiss other people's pain. Or because you are saying that people shouldn't grieve and there is an appropriate amount of grief people should feel. Or perhaps the statement that if we all just ignore our pain then it will magically go away. Take your pick on that one. Maybe you are cool with having your flesh and blood torn from you before they even get the chance to see the light of day but that's kind of fucking painful for some people and it's really fucking rude to minimize another's suffering."]}
