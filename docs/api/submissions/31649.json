If you need your kids to help with their siblings, you have too many damn spawns!", "You should stop lending money to them. I\u2019ve had to set that boundary with a sibling.", "NTA - As heartbreaking as miscarriages are I know that you were trying to remind her that she has six children already and that that in itself is a blessing. I get the feeling that you're sharing more information with us than what you said in the actual conversation. Regardless of the motive you were just trying to turn her attention to her small town of a family. As far as finances go I wouldn't loan her money, instead, if she's struggling to buy food, clothes etc then go shopping with her and pay if she really needs it. But always be sure that she knows you're only doing it for the wellbeing of her children. I don't approve of her turning her eldest into a care taker for the others, please make sure that girls doing okay. It's abusive and neglectful to have a child raise their siblings and is a clear sign that you're absolutely correct in pointing out that she has more than enough children already. I don't know what possesses people to bring children into this world that they can't support, it's irresponsible and you shouldn't have to pick up all the pieces.", "Your sister might decide enough is enough if it isn't financially viable. You loaning her money multiple times is just enabling her.", "NTA\n\nYou probably should've said this after child 4 or 5, not after a miscarriage. \n\nBut you are right. If you need your kids to raise your kids, then you have too many kids.", "NTA.  Sometimes things just have to be said. Even if the timing is unfortunate. It's very sad she had a miscarriage, of course. But when are you going to say it? will you wait until she gets pregnant again?  \nHopefully it will sink in somehow that they already have more kids than they can afford, and are having to ask for money from you or others(?--or maybe just you?).", "It may be a controversial opinion, but I believe that, while the parents\u2019 pain over a miscarriage must be acknowledged and discussed and taken seriously, there\u2019s too much stigma around this. Miscarriages in the first 2-3 months are extremely common; miscarriages can happen so early that a pregnancy is not even identified. Parents are usually so aware of the possibility of a miscarriage that most wait over 12 weeks to share the happy news with friends and family.\r\n\nI mention this because I\u2019ve seen some comments here suggesting OP\u2019s sister \u201clost a baby\u201d. Comments like this, IMO, perpetuate the idea that the grieving process that results from a miscarriage is equal to losing a baby when a pregnancy that\u2019s carried full term \u2013 if, god forbid, the child is stillborn, or dies from SIDS. \r\n\nThe way people comfort parents that go such tragedies is not the same. It\u2019s not uncommon, as OP said in a comment, to acknowledge a miscarriage as a sad situation, yet remind the parents that these things are not uncommon and unfortunately happen, and that the parents can always try again. The \u201ctry again\u201d part is not something you\u2019d usually say immediately when comforting someone whose baby was a stillborn or lost to SIDS in the first months of life. Here, there\u2019s a clear understanding that another child, either already part of the family or still to be conceived, can\u2019t never replace the one that was lost. When talking about a miscarriage, bringing up the other children as a source of comfort is, IMO, acceptable.\r\n\nSo NTA.", "NTA, she has no business having a baby she can't provide for.

That wasn't the right time to come out with something like that, OP. \n\nAs to your sister, I would no longer loan any money for her from now on until she finally realises she has had enough kids.

I know someone who has had several miscarriage, suffered fertility issues, struggled with Ivf, and stopped talking to her pregnant friends or friends with babies because it is too difficult for her to handle her loss. I, myself, had to go through months of counselling. A loss is a loss, and a person's grief is the same whether the grief is for someone with or without a physical body.", "Did you miscarry at 7 months and have to deliver a dead body?", "You\u2019ve obviously never been pregnant. JFC is there literally something wrong with you?", "Even though I didn\u2019t miscarry my 1st child the threat alone was soul crushing. They both bring forth a devastating grief. They are both your children that you didn\u2019t get to meet while alive. \nYour attempt to rank grief is callous. Your sisters experience was hers alone.", "I agree with you completely. I will never judge anyone dealing with fertility issues grieving the thought that \u201cthis is it\u2014 it\u2019s working, I\u2019m going to get to have a baby\u201d, and facing the daunting task of having to start over again, and it being that much more time and effort to have to do. The loss of the possibility of a baby. \n\nBut that is completely different than grieving the loss of an actual specific baby.", "You have a reading comprehension problem.\nGet lost.", "Yeah I wish that were the case but the reality is CPS only gets involved if kids are bleeding or bruised or there are major allegations of wrong doing (meth lab, etc). \n\nThere are too many kids in need and too few resources.", "Good to know! I seriously had no idea.", "It can qualify as emotional abuse which DCFS in my county can take a report on. If it isn\u2019t \u201creportable\u201d they can also save the information should something happen in the future so there is documentation of a pattern.", "I wasn\u2019t trying to make any point; not sure why you thought I was. I was curious and trying to wrap my mind around this because it\u2019s a concept I wasn\u2019t previously familiar with.", "So when you say that, do you mean like the 15 year old is \u201cbabysitting\u201d the kids with no parent present? Making food and such?", "I agree that parentification is wrong but I thought your comment was ironic and probably would be a worse to do while the sister is grieving", "I know my experience, and they shouldn't exist. I left the US to get away from them because as soon as you're in the system, you are always guilty. I'm in a country where the government stays out of your business.  If you do abuse the child, you're arrested, like you should be. CPS shouldn't exist.", "\u201cI\u2019m so sorry that you couldn\u2019t burden your 15 year old with another kid to care for.\u201d", "Was thinking the same thing. This one seems to lack empathy, either that or common sense.", "Idiocracy IRL", "Oh im sorry for having empathy for a woman who lost a child?", "Parentification is abuse. Child abusers don\u2019t deserve to have children.", "It's very obvious the mother is experiencing mental issues, and doesn't understand the impact her actions are having on her children, I hope she can get help", "Calm the hell down. That is a nearly full term pregnancy and obviously a more intense loss but there is still no reason to treat miscarriage like the sole worst loss a woman or other uterus owner can possibly endure no matter what. One of my two was a relief and while I was sad for a couple of weeks after my other I do not consider it to be the same as losing a child to still birth, SIDS, or an accident", "I actually just read your other comments as well and answered this one. But you seem like a lovely person.... not. So have the day you deserve.", "Glad to be of assistance. And again, it's not something the US has signed, and I guess, therefore not taught in US schools.", "Hmmm... I only answered your question, and I didn't make any assumptions about your belief... so, I'm unsure why you're offended? This is a bit strange. \n\nIn my first paragraph, I'm simply pointing out that just because certain practices have been going on since the beginning of human history doesn't make it ok.", "Where ahe becomes the primary. Babysitting, not so much. Though I object to that being forced. They made the kids, they should pay for care. If the parents are present, and the 15 year old is STILL having to take care of them, then those parents never deserved children at all.", "If things are truly bad enough where a CPS call is warranted, then the mom\u2019s grief is irrelevant. It needs to be reported for the sake of girl, it\u2019s not about the parents.", "There\u2019s a HUGE difference between you shouldn\u2019t say things that will be painful to a grieving parent, even if true, and you should place a grieving parent\u2019s feelings above the wellbeing of a child who is likely the victim of abuse.\n\nAbused child > grieving parent > harsh truth.\n\nEdit: grammar.", "I didn't say WHEN to, but I see what you mean. \nNow Alanis Morissette is playing in my brain.", "It's suspicious that you left to avoid CPS though", "Op makes it clear that they have also said this to someone, a supposed friend, who didn't have any children at all.  And op uses the word 'comfort'.  This isn't comfort.", "Lmao. No. That isn't what that was and not what this is about. That's why you deleted your comment.\n\nTake your personal issues to your therapist. This isn't about your miscarriage.", "Well that\u2019s a bummer. But that\u2019s the U.S. for you\u2026greatest in absolutely nothing except maybe CEO pay.", "lol it\u2019s not so serious my friend. You said I wasn\u2019t making the point I thought I was making, which was confusing because I wasn\u2019t making any point. Neither was I offended then or now. Sometimes bored people like me take learning opportunities in the most random places, even Reddit! \ud83e\udd2a", "Okay I think I understand now, thanks! And hard agree; kids are supposed to be kids and not unpaid labor!", "When I read that she also said that to a friend I was appalled. I did not mind people saying that when I had a miscarriage because it did give me some hope, but still not quite the right thing to say. You should just say sorry and leave it at that", "I do believe this is a case of the U.S not being a country, but rather 50 dressed in a trenchcoat mascerading as one.", "Why do you think I'm taking this seriously? This is reddit after all.  Lol.", "Hahaha that is terrific; I\u2019m stealing!"]}
