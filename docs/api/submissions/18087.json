They are currently living in husband's parent's basement, which is obviously not a good living arrangement for anyone involved.  With the help of my wife's parents, they purchased their first home and closed on it last week.  \n\nWithout my knowledge, my wife not only volunteered the use of my truck and trailer, but also my time to help SIL and her family move this coming weekend.  When she told me about it, I told her I don't want to spend my time this weekend helping someone move.  She asked me what I planned on doing this weekend that would prevent me from helping and I told her the truth, absolutely nothing.  \n\nI work construction and the last thing I want to do after doing manual labor all week, is to do more manual labor on the weekend.  Sure, I'll probably mow the lawn and putz around on a few other yard work projects.  But I also want to get together with friends and enjoy a long weekend.  \n\nThe house SIL and her husband are moving to is about 45-minutes from where they are living now.  And husband's parent's house is an hour from where we live.  My wife is convinced that we can do it all in one trip if we use my truck and trailer and that it won't take all day.  I am not that optimistic and am fully aware that moving never goes as smoothly as you think it will.  \n\nI also do not doubt for a second that I am going to be one of the people to do most of the heavy lifting.  I'm not trying to be sexist or anything, but I don't think my wife or SIL are going to be moving any dressers or couches.  \n\nI told my wife she's free to take my truck and trailer and help them, but I'm not doing it.  She said she doesn't know how to drive with a trailer and that I'm the only one who is comfortable doing that sort of thing.  She said her sister needs help with this and we are in a position to help her, so we should do it.  She said that she doesn't want to feel like she can never ask her sister for help if we need it.  \n\nNot to sound arrogant, but I can't really foresee many situations where we would need SIL's help.  My wife and I don't have kids, we are financially stable, and we live comfortably within our means.  Yes, I understand emergencies happen, but moving out of your parent's basement isn't an emergency.  \n\nAlso, SIL has already a substantial amount of help from her parents and her in-laws.  At some point, you have to stop holding their hands every step of the way and let them figure it out on their own.  I understand they have 2 babies and moving is stressful, but I don't want to spend an entire weekend doing all the heavy lifting.  \n\nMy wife is mad at me for refusing to help and said that SIL is already banking on using my truck and trailer.  I told her that's not my problem because I never agreed to do it.

It sucks and, OP, you are absolutely right that you will be doing the heavy lifting. The folks who spend their time packing boxes don't understand how physically intensive it is to actually carry all of the heavy shit.\n\nIt isn't ok for your wife to volunteer your labor. \n\nYou have every right to simply not be interested in moving anyone.", "NTA. First off, wife should have asked in plenty of time for them to hire movers if you said no. Second, they are not under a time constraint, because your MIL won't put their stuff out at the kerb. They can take essentials in their car, and move the big items when they can raise enough money to hire movers. Third, if you damage your back doing the brunt of the lifting - how will you work?", "NTA. Even one's spouse doesn't get to volunteer one's time and resources without clearing it with one first. Doesn't matter her opinion of how much/little effort it will be for you to do this task, she doesn't get to offer you up without your say-so.", "NTA. do wife and SIL not know that professional movers exist? if they can afford to buy a house, they should be able to afford to move into it. sure, it would be nice if you helped. but you have legit reasons for saying no.", "NTA, your wife should have asked you first, she probably offered you up not thinking although, if it's repeat behaviour then it's just plain disrespectful, my partner had a habit of doing this type of thing early in our relationship but we had a talk about boundaries and that's all sorted now.\n\nYour wife doesn't have a right to be mad and to me she is just mad about the prospect of her losing face to her family by having to back out of it.", "NTA. Your wife never should have voluntold you you're going to help move.\n\nSmall local movers exist. Suggest SIL use them.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019d counter her offer with your own offer- you are willing to drive the truck and trailer and that\u2019s it. They can have friends or family members help with the heavy lifting. Tell your wife your not willing to risk getting hurt doing all the heavy lifting as then your livelihood would be affected. You can\u2019t work construction injured. \n\nYour probably right in assuming you will be doing everything. Who\u2019s watching the babies while they move? I\u2019d assume the mom won\u2019t be doing much in terms of unloading the vehicles as she has two babies to watch. \n\nDoes your wife plan to do manual labour helping move as well? \n\nDoes the husband not have friends that can help them out? \n\nIf they aren\u2019t happy with that counter offer they are more than welcome to rent a uhaul truck.", "NTA. That is a HUGE ask (and burden) that you got volunteered to do. No thanks.", "NTA. You have to ask that kind of thing, not assume. \n\nSIL and family can still go rent a U-Haul. That\u2019s the solution.", "NTA\n\nBeing voluntold on short notice that you will be the primary moving crew is a crappy move on the part of your wife. Let your SIL and her husband find a few more strong backs to help you with their move.", "NTA. That is a huge deal!  Astonished your wife would volunteer you without first asking you.", "NTA\n\nMoving is a pain in the ass and it obviously usually requires a lot of effort.\nI have always held the opinion that if you\u2019re going to move and can\u2019t do it on your own, you might as well shell out the extra money to hire movers. \nYes, I know it can be expensive, but it\u2019s a good idea. At least the movers are being *paid* to lift & carry boxes all day.\n\nThere\u2019s also an option to rent a big moving truck instead \u2014 the type that\u2019s big enough to load everything into, rather than use a smaller truck and trailer. \n\nNo one wants to help lift heavy boxes and furniture all day, especially family members who get dragged into it unwillingly. Your wife should have talked to you first, because even if you have \u201cnothing to do\u201d, it\u2019s still your time and would be used for something you don\u2019t want to do.", "Dude... okay. Look. Lots of people are saying NTA, and I agree. They're all correct. Your wife has no business volunteering you to move stuff, but come on, dude. You can't even drive the truck and trailer for her? And the \"if I do that, I'll be roped into helping,\" come on, man, just help your wife out. \n\nYou're NTA in this situation, but you're not being a great husband. Why not compromise and say something like \"okay I'll help, but that means I'll be spending next weekend however I want, and you can not get mad at me.\" Or something, I don't know. Also, communicate and say, \"I dont appreciate being volunteered without my knowledge or permission. It makes me feel used. Please consult with me before volunteering me for anything in the future.\" \n\nTo your wife, this IS an emergency man. She desperately wants to help her sister. Don't make her feel like she has to choose between you two. Once you start doing that, there's a chance she won't choose you at all. \n\nJust help your wife. Whether you like it or not, you digging your heels in over this is kind of a defining moment in your marriage right now, and believe me, she's gonna remember it.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA.  First and foremost, she doesn't get to volunteer your time for you.  I have a hard time believing one trip with one truck/trailer will be enough.  You're correct that you'll be doing most of the work.  Lastly, asking someone to help you move is a big ask, and a dick move to aks someone with a physical labor job.  If your wife wants to help, you can help pay for movers.", "NTA\n\nSimply because she volunteered you, your time and your property WITHOUT discussing it with you FIRST. \n\nThen is being dismissive of the fact that you want to relax after working hard all damn week. As well as being dismissive of what YOU want.\n\nIt doesn't matter at all. It is YOUR time to do woth as you see fit.", "NTA\n\nShe can volunteer herself but not someone else without asking. They are old enough to figure it out themselves.", "NTA, your wife shouldn\u2019t volunteer your manual labor, but it would be nice of you", "NTA. They can hire movers like other adults. I\u2019ve moved 12 times as an adult and I\u2019ve never had help from anyone. Just paid the movers.", "NTA. \n\nWhen I lived in apartments, I moved my own stuff. By the time I could afford to buy a house, I had enough sense to budget for professional movers.", "NTA- she should have asked first instead of volunteering you , specially on a holiday weekend. \n\nThat\u2019s just rude .", "with 2 babies, they need to hire a moving company to pack everything, move it and then unpack it. anything else is nuts.  NTA", "NTA, you do physical work all week, your body needs a rest.  Take you wife on a driving lesson or someone can come and get the rig.", "NTA. Do not help her move. The volunteering will continue every time something comes up because you backed down. Don\u2019t let them use the truck either. I get the feeling they will damage it as they don\u2019t know how to drive with one. This is BS. Enjoy your long weekend not moving stuff.", "youre NTA but your wife is. who volunteered someone else to help someone move?! i dont even wanna do it when i agree to it..", "ESH - your wife should never volunteer your time without asking. She screwed up. But what do you want her to do now? She promised her family and there is no way she can back out without making her family resent the both of you.\n\nI think you\u2019re going to end up helping them move and I\u2019d stop resisting early to avoid resentment. Think of it as a favor for your wife and not a favor for your in-laws.", "I have to imagine with the way he is acting she has voluntold him for things before\n\nI totally understand the feeling when you are pumped to have some down time and some BS comes up.... made all the worse when it is a really un fun thing to do and in this case literal manual labor", "Honestly I would\u2019ve simply hire a company to move the heavy stuff. Not as expensive as people think but it made life so much easier when I had help my dad move and I couldn\u2019t get any of my friends to help due to timing. They could even move the heavy or large boxes as well. \n\nNTA. Wife should have asked first", "NTA. They need to hire movers.

Happy wife = happy life. I suspect yours is pretty frosty, and you'd better hope you don't need sny favors from them in a long, long time.", "This is a tough one.  I read one of your comments that your wife doesn't typically volunteer you for stuff, so it's not like this is an every weekend thing.  But nobody likes to have their free time given away, so there's that.\n\nIf I were you I would tell your wife that you will help for a specific amount of time, maybe 6 hours, on Saturday, and that's it.  Then make sure she knows that she needs to check with you before committing you to doing something because if there is a next time, you will not do what she signed you up for.\n\nI also get that she wants to help her sister and her family.  Your family.  And you are kind of an extension of your wife, so it makes sense to me that she would assume that you would be willing to help.  \n\nYou mention, a few times, that your SIL and BIL have had a lot of help.  Do you have some issues around that?  Are you the type of person that thinks that people should not receive help from their family... financially, that is?  It's great that you and your wife are in a good financial position, but not everybody is.  Some people legitimately need help to get themselves on track.\n\nI completely agree with you with your hypothetical situation of if you signed your wife up to cook for a get together... you would get roasted.  I guess the only difference in that situation is that your wife would be doing all the work, whereas in this moving situation, there are multiple people.  Realistically, we could debate all day about that, but who wants to do that?\n\nI guess it comes down to this... your wife is going to be upset with you and probably disappointed in you.  Will losing that matter to you?  If this negatively affects your marriage, will your refusal to help for a few hours on Saturday be worth it?\n\nI completely understand that you are pissed that your wife volunteered you to help on your day off.  You work all week in a very physical job and you need the time off.  I am an accountant, not a physical job obviously, and I really look forward to the weekends.  Also, I am the kind of person that prefers to be home and not around people.  So I get it.  However, I know that sometimes I have to put my own needs aside for those that I love.\n\nThe way I see it you have two choices... refuse to help, potentially damage your marriage and get a full 3 day weekend to do nothing (my favorite kind of weekend!)... or set some strict rules for helping (specific hours and one day), make your wife happy and probably get lucky.", "INFO: If she had asked you nicely beforehand, making it clear she understood it was a huge ask and gave you the space to say no, would you have actually said no? Are you refusing because the proper procedure wasn't followed and you resent the presumption or because you'd really say no to this one weekend for a family favor?", "OK. so technically NTA, but geez - it wouldn't kill you to help out one weekend.  This isn't an every weekend thing, how often is your sister in law going to move?  And this is as much a favor to your wife as to your sister and brother in law.   Especially putting it on a value for value basis - what's your sister in law going to be able to do for you in the future - makes you pretty darn selfish.", "Sorry but YTA and I don\u2019t understand all other comments. Is it culture, what is it, I don\u2019t know. But making such big deal out of it when it\u2019s family (sorry but it is your family weather you like it or it) I don\u2019t get it. And I know people on Reddit like to scream against family and \u2018screw them\u2019 but this is not how life works. Especially the part \u2018we won\u2019t need their help\u2019. You never know. That\u2019s a very bad thing to say when you don\u2019t know what tomorrow brings. Anyway even if you don\u2019t \u2018need their help\u2019, helping your wife and her sister with little twins is so hard? Really? When did people become this cold?", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t do this to my husband. Mostly because I know how much moving sucks. We moved 3 years ago with 2 kids and budgeted in the move to get movers and a moving truck. Because moving sucks even without that help. We still boxed it all ourselves and it was incredibly hard physically packing up an entire house, and the unpacking. I was on par tired with moving that I was from child birth.", "As some one who does manual labor daily as well I gotta say a huge NTA. In fact I\u2019d be just as mad if I were put in this situation.", "NTA. \n\nI've had an insane few weeks at work lately and couldn't wait for this past weekend to just have off and do literally nothing aside from relax. I got signed up to some anniversary thing that my parents friends were having be it I haven't even seen these people since I was a little kid, I decided not to go. I don't like being signed up for things and also on short notice as well. \n\nDoing nothing is good for the soul, and you're NTA for that.", "NTA.

An absolute gem in any family. Who would not want you for a husband or brother-in-law. \nSuch a big heart and a generous sole.\n\nSarcasm aside ... technically you are NTA and have every right to saying no and not helping them move. \nBUT... you also shoe your wife and her family, that they cannot rely on you when they need help with something.\n\nYou are basically showing your wife and the rest if the world a type of man NOT to marry or stay married to. \n\nOut of 52 weekends in a year you just don't want to spend a single day helping your wife's closest family with a very big thing in their lives...\n\nNever mind.. spend your weekend doing whatever you want. It's good practice for lonely weekends to come, when your wife is an ex-wife, and people just don't want to spend any time helping you because you couldn't be bothered to help them. \n\nNTA, but you will soon be a divorced \"NTA\"", "NTA. I'd let him use the truck and trailer, bit that would be the extent.", "NTA, but just do it anyway dude.

NTA", "Having just helped someone move from a one story walk-up this weekend, NTA. \n\nIt's a physically exhausting, awful day of heavy lifting and I wouldn't do it for anyone else in the world except my best friend.

I know this b/c we have the truck and trailer and have been asked to help out b4 by husband's family multiple times in the past. My husband usually would agree to appease everyone (although he'd complain to me the whole time, and he's always annoyed that he's being volunteered all the time by his parents to help out his aunts and uncles--my husband's annoyed because those same aunts/uncles were never around and they all had adult kids as old as my husband but none of them wanted to help their parents so my husband got stuck with having to help).\n\nIt's really AH of your wife to volunteer your time and labor WITHOUT consulting you first...thou.\n\nI'd say NTA though.\n\nETA: I'd say that be careful with burning bridges with family. You may want to suck it up...and get them to 'owe' you. Right now you're in the position of 'power' as in you have good job, etc, you can lend a hand, but life can throw you a curveball. What if you get injured, or sick and you need their help... not saying it'll happen, but it's a what if. They will always remember you rebuffed them.

Next time she\u2019ll think twice before volunteering your time and property without clearing it with you.", "I don\u2019t even have to read this to know you NTA. My time off is valuable. When you work a manuel labor job like that, you need time to decompress.

She doesn't get to volunteer you without even asking.", "Isn't this why god invented U-Haul??", "NTA. This is the kind of crap men put up with in that \"happy wife, happy life\" mindset. How would she feel if you told her you volunteered her to host baby shower for, one of your female relatives and 45 guests at your home without consulting her at all?", "NTA", "NTA part of moving expenses is movers", "NTA Your wife needs to realize that she is not entitled to offer your time and labor. She can volunteer to do whatever she wants but you are not obligated to do anything unless you agree to it in advance. My husband tried to volunteer on my behalf once.

The first time we \u201cwalked\u201d the items up the road, one by one, including a 3 seater sofa.  However a lot of stuff got loaded into a UHaul and brought to us from Dorset. Basically our parents offloaded a lot of stuff they thought we would appreciate, moving into our first home. We are still (40 years later) using some of the dining chairs but we have scrapped most of it in the intervening years (would anyone want a 50yo working GEC fridge?).\n\nThe second time, my husband got his friends to help him pack up and load up the Uhaul. I know part of it was that I refused to help him pack up and move 10 years of a weekly music newspaper that are still stacked up in our loft. I will never understand how one box of my sci-fi/fantasy books got lost but I managed to replace them eventually. \n\nBasically, we have NEVER had to pay professional removers.\n\nI suspect however that is a pure fluke.\n\nNTA for refusing to replace the professionals. Time cost does not cover it\u2026.\n\nThe second time, we loaded up our car and moved it ourselves. I will admit we were talking about 1 mile up the road, and no large white goods. It might have taken 3-4 trips (I honestly can\u2019t remember now how we did it, but it was not by hiring movers or a Uhaul).

She should have asked you about it and come to an agreement with you first.\n\nHowever, the way you talk about how you won't ever need SIL's help and how they \"need to figure it out\" is very cold. You know their current living situation is stressful. Yet you seem hung up on the idea of not helping them because they'll never return the favour. That's just so bizarre to me. Like I'd understand if it was a distant relative or friend you don't know super well, but this is your SIL.\n\nI get it. Having a trailer and a truck means you probably get asked for favours a lot. You work a physical job during the week. But if this is a one off move, the polite thing to do would be to help out and not keep score on favours owed. If your wife routinely volunteers you and your truck for stuff like this, that's a bit of a different issue.", "NTA and your wife should have cleared it with you, but as a married man, you will not win this argument.", "Op, if your wife didn't volunteer you, would you have offered to help?

Like\u2026 life can be insanely cruel sometimes. You really can\u2019t count on the good times rolling forever, if OP wants to be so transactional that he\u2019ll only give help if he\u2019s sure he\u2019ll get it back.", "If OP\u2019s wife has a history of voluntelling him often, he needs to provide context for that. I\u2019m not going to fill in the gaps with information I don\u2019t have. Extrapolation only goes so far.\n\nI did agree that how she went about it was not cool and worth a conversation.", "And how many times will this keep going on ? Sounds like she\u2019s always going to offer up his spare time because she didn\u2019t even consider him in the first place.", "I've been married for almost a decade and we never volunteer each other for things. We always discuss it first. That's how a healthy partnership works.", "You're joking, right? I've never volunteered my wife for anything without running it by her first.", "You expect your partner to follow through on things they committed to. OP didn\u2019t commit to anything. There should\u2019ve been a conversation before the wife told the in-laws OP and his stuff were available.", "I\u2019ve been happily married for 18 years and still manage to respect my partner\u2019s time and agency, so I haven\u2019t run into this issue yet.", "A marriage is also supposed to be an equal partnership, where decisions are agreed upon together....", "follow trough plans she did not care to inform previoulsy to see if op agreed to do ir or not....\n\nwtf", "your wife should respect you and your time by ASKING you BEFORE voluntolding her famlee you would help.", ">to follow through \n\n\"Follow through\" implies that someone agreed to a task. OP didn't agree to do anything so he's not failing to follow through.\n\nSince everyone else is doing it - after nearly 22 years of marriage, neither my spouse nor I have ever volunteered the other without asking first. That's because we respect each other's free will.", "there\u2019s a huge difference between being a dependable partner and being obligated without your knowledge. the wife is kind of an AH for volunteering someone to do physical labor. \n\njobs that require physical labor usually have some kind of expiration date due to the wear and tear on the body. it feels like the wife is taking advantage of her husband.", "No, wife presumed she could dictate what another person does or does not do with their time. That's not how this should work. My wife and I agree to things for each other or both of us, but only tentatively. \"Yeah, we should be able to do that, I just need to confirm with X\". It's that easy to respect your partner's time and wishes.", "That\u2019s why I said NTA? You can be technically in the right and still upset people. Also, it\u2019s a pretty shallow way to see your relationship with your wife\u2019s direct immediate family as \u201cher problem\u201d. These are people you will presumably have a relationship to some extent with for the rest of your life.", "Yes? I do it all the time, Because we are a team and a partnership. I often do things in my skill set to help with my in-laws (including moving and building furniture) because that\u2019s what family does. And he does the same for my family. Even if it comes up at the last minute or is unexpected.", "It\u2019s a day. Either way. They are the same.\n\nIf he had plans, 100%, bail on it. Either of them. But he doesn\u2019t. So you do it. And if you don\u2019t understand this, well, tell me you aren\u2019t married without saying you aren\u2019t married.", "Its happy spouse happy house.  Your wife was 100 in the wrong for volunteering you without asking.  I dont know how yall do y'alls finances but maybe your wife can help them pay a few people to do the heavy lifting", "OK, so being \"voluntold\" for this event is more an *exception* than the rule with your wife.  Which is why YTA for not just sucking it up and helping, for her sake.\n\nYou're the only one apparently who can drive the truck/trailer, so go do that. You said there's plenty of other help, there's no mandate for you to lead the charge on the entire process. Or tell them all the trailer work has to be done the first day, because you've got plans the second day.", "None of that has any bearing on my comment, you claim HE was being transactional when it was literally his wife that brought up the transactional aspect.", "emphasis on healthy.", "Agreed.", "This, honestly.  I\u2019m not married and there have been situations that have come up where I think, \u201coh, X might be able to help,\u201d but I\u2019d never volunteer them without asking first.  If it\u2018s one of those situations where you\u2019re put on the spot, then you don\u2019t say, \u201coh, X can do it!  X will be there!\u201d but rather, \u201coh, I know someone who might be able to help, but I will check their availability and get back to you.\u201d\n\nThat way, if they want to help, they can, but if not, you can safely go back and just say that X was busy.  It creates no obligation and no hard feelings.", "yanno?", "i am married, and my husband treats me like a fully formed person who is able to make their own decisions so he doesn\u2019t actually volunteer my body and time and property to others.", "Just curious, if I decided to throw a party and volunteered my wife to do all the cooking without asking, would you think that she should do it?  I mean, if she doesn't have anything else going on, why shouldn't she, right?", ">You're the only one apparently who can drive the truck/trailer, so go do that.\n\nLOL if you believe that, I have a bridge to sell you.  We all know how that would go.  \"OP, we just need help with this one heavy item.\"  \"Oh, can you help with this one, too?\"  \n\nYou really think I could get away with just sitting in the truck and not doing anything else?  No way.", "Is this OP's wife?", "A party is =/= helping family in need. If you wanted to host a family member in need and she was the only one who knew how to use the kitchen, I'd hope she would be understanding.\n\nBut, yes. She should have asked you first.", "Who said \"just sit in the truck\"? Maybe you should take more notice of how lazier people manage to do less without throwing a big public fit in advance.\n\nWhatever, enjoy your weekend. You're still an asshole **to your wife.**", "Oh, so I'm not family to my wife?  That's news to me.", "What are you even talking about? Where did I imply that?"]}
