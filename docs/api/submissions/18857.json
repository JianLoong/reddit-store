Time to get a job and move out. As for him \"putting all his hopes and dreams\" on you, he is very disappointed due to your carelessness. He has been a child raising children most of his life, more than likely. It's rough. Sounds like he wanted more for you, but now you are going to be exactly that.", "YTA. You're still a child and I guess your gf is too. Dillon had to quit school to look after you. He's never had his own life. He has sacrificed for you and wanted better for you. He has every right to be upset.", "YTA for not recognizing what your brother did for you. But I guess that if you think you can be a dad, I guess it's time for you to start working at a diner and cut your brother some slack", "YTA - it takes a lot to raise all your siblings when it is not your responsibility to do so. Especially when you have shit for parents. Your brother sacrificed a lot to raise all of you. He has every right to be angry and disappointed. \n\nHow are you going to support a baby at 15 years old? Are you expecting your brother to help you?  After everything he\u2019s already done for all of you?! You\u2019re ungrateful and selfish. He could\u2019ve let you all go to foster care; yet chose to step in. Why give him one more mouth to help feed or one more person to depend on him? Have you consider getting a job so that you can take the weight off your brother? He\u2019s your brother, not your parent. This is just a despicable situation. \nMake better choices.

You should be shitting your pants terrified because of how much this is going to alter your entire life forever. You have absolutely no comprehension of how much work and how much money babies cost.

At 15, even if you have a part time job, you won\u2019t be able to earn enough to support your child. Which means that responsibility for feeding, housing and medical expenses will fall on your brother, as your guardian. Dillon knows exactly what it takes to raise kids when you\u2019re very young- he\u2019s been raising you and your brothers- and he knows how damn hard it is, how much money it takes and he doesn\u2019t want to take on responsibility for another baby. \n\n\nYour Gf will need a lot of support and medical care. Are her parents able to help or are they furious about this? Where will she and the baby live? At home with her family? Do you intend to live with her or have her stay with you? Does she have to pay for medical care and does she have insurance which covers maternity care? How do you intend to provide for your child? Do you know what nappies and food, etc costs? I realise you are very young and you\u2019re excited about your baby but as a father,it\u2019s your job to be realistic and put your child first which means their needs come first- can you meet those needs? \n\n\nDillon is worried to death about you, your Gf and your child.  He is staring down the barrel of having to make enough money to help support this child as well as you and potentially your GF if her family won\u2019t help. He sees your dreams going up in smoke and you not realising how tough this will be. He\u2019s disappointed and scared. Please do listen to him- he\u2019s had your back for your entire life. Sit down with him and get the real story on what you will need to do to be a father at 15. Talk to your GF and find out what her family will do to help and make a choice together. If she wants to terminate then support her. You have decades to have a family but right now, when you can\u2019t afford to even buy nappies and are dependent on Dillon, is not the time.

Do you really think at 15 you can be a Dad?", "You have to be a troll because no 15 yr old that actually understands the responsibilities of being a parent would be so stupid to be excited to be a parent at 15.  If you are going to be a father then it's time for you to get a job and support yourself and your child, it is not your brother's responsibility.  The most sensible options are for gf to either have an abortion or put the baby up for adoption.", "Dear Dillion \n\nGet the fuck out now. These ungrateful lazy people don't deserve you \n\nYou don't need to raise and financially support another baby.

You deserve the world", "I\u2019m sorry, but your priorities are extremely messed up. You\u2019re putting your gf\u2019s life in danger because you wanted to nut? Her body hasn\u2019t finished developing, and forcing it to go though those changes while she\u2019s still so young is selfish and disgusting.

Financially stable adults in todays world arent even having kids because the cost of living has gone out of control.

Otherwise at the very least YTDA (think Red Foreman).", "if you expect him to pay for you, your girlfriend and your baby, you\u2019re dead wrong. time to grow up, get a job and be a man", "Mate. I don't want to call you an AH, but let's just say Dillon is definitely not an AH. I can completely understand why he's disappointed and frustrated; he's given up a lot to try to give you the opportunities he missed out on.\n\nYou need to be pragmatic re this pregnancy and work out how you can do this without relying on Dillon. Frankly I think it's time you and your brothers thought about giving back to him instead of expecting more.", "ESH you\u2019re excited to be a father? Are you prepared to be one? Do you have a job capable of supporting a child? Childcare? Dillon gave up all of his hopes and dreams to make sure all of you were ok and I\u2019m guessing that includes taking care of your mother as well. No he shouldn\u2019t have put his hopes and dreams on you, he should have saved a little for himself so that once you\u2019re all 18 he can go chase his actual dreams.  I\u2019m also sure if you don\u2019t have a job or a plan he\u2019s figured out that he will now be responsible for another one or two mouths to feed and also is saddened that you\u2019re in a similar predicament to his in that you\u2019re going to have way too much responsibility tying you down to one place way too soon.", "[removed]", "INFO: Are you expecting to live off him?", "Ok, let\u2019s say this is not made up. How are you going to support this baby and your girlfriend? Surely you are not expecting your brother to sacrifice even more? You were very irresponsible and I\u2019d be upset too if I was him.

Your brother raised you and expected better for you but now that's not happened and he's probably angry at you, himself, your mother since he never really got to be a kid or have a life. \n\nI am gonna say you should have made sure you were using protection and it's irresponsible to get your girlfriend pregnant at 15. \n\nYour brother will be fine eventually, he never should have had to be responsible for you all growing up but that doesn't mean you have to be the one to escape the current situation", "NTA shit happens and you can still become an archaeologist with a baby it\u2019s just going to be harder - take online classes, start out at community college and go to an online school\n\nBut also get a job to support this baby", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Even more dangerous is the narrative that it\u2019ll all work out magically somehow (it doesn\u2019t always). Teen parents often end up having children who become teen parents, so these types of more-often-than-not unstable situations are what\u2019s normal to some people. It\u2019s pretty scary.", "You have got to be joking. His brother has sacrificed his entire life to make sure his siblings were in a better position than him. I can only imagine what his childhood was like with a parent like that, and he still chose to step up to the plate when it was not his responsibility to do so. This is a slap in the face.", "Why is his brother an AH though?", "So his brother is an AH?", "You can't really get the necessary field and lab experience for this type of scientific career through online school.", "Question: How are you going to take care of the baby? Are you going to quit school and get a job? Or do you expect your brother Dillon to work harder, sacrifice his life even more and continue to put his needs on hold so that he supports you as you play at being a father?\n\nHe was probably looking forward to successfully getting you to 18 and you completing high school, so he can finally have a life. I can't imagine his dream was to raise his siblings, or to quit school at 16. The fact that he talked about losers and leaving the town means that he hates the life that circumstances have forced him to live. He feels stuck in his life, in that town, in that job. The only reason he is still around is to take care of you guys. He could have put himself first, continued his education, let you guys go into foster care or whatever, went to college, left that town, lived the life that he dreamt of. After all you're not his children or his responsibility. But he put his own needs and wants aside, probably working at a deadend job because that is all he could find (with his lack of qualifications). And now when he is almost free of the unwanted responsibilities, more is being added to his plate? Poor Dillon.\n\nEdit: If you and your girlfriend decide to go ahead with the pregnancy, please be prepared for the responsibility that comes with it. You're just a year younger than Dillon was when adult responsibilities were forced on him by circumstances. He figured it out. You can figure it out too. Don't put this on Dillon. He didn't knock someone up. And he has sacrificed enough. You would be the a-hole (big one) if you expect Dillon to take responsibility for this too.\n\nEdited.", "He can control his sperm.

I think Dillon is worried about that too!", "Time to move in with her mom", "I get that it has been and probably will be difficult, but it isn\u2019t the end of the world, even if it may feel like it.
