Your friends are coming out to ski with you, why would you want to miss time with them to teach a novice to ski for free.", "NTA. If they don't come because they're too cheap to pay for a lesson and feel entitled to your skills, score! Sounds like a better time for you and the rest of the group.", "NTA.

Geez, don't threaten me with a good time.  No one is this entitled in a vacuum - they'll be chiseling right and left if they come.  Buying extra stuff at dinner and asking to equally split the bill, trying to borrow everyone else's nice stuff, not chipping in for gas, etc.", "NTA - \"Sorry you can't make it\"", "NTA.  They're grown-ups supposedly; they should act like it.", "NTA. I would call their bluff and let them stay home.", "NTA. You're not even a ski teacher. Even if you're friends weren't visiting I wouldn't do that. Who knows what would happen and in the emd it would be your fault", "NTA but that was super presumptuous of your friend that you wouldn\u2019t mind giving up your time bc you live in CO and rude of her not to ask first. She should have asked before even considering offering your time. Good for you for not letting her bully you into doing something you don\u2019t want to. Also if this is any indication of their behavior it sounds like the trip might be more enjoyable for everyone if they do back out", "NTA. He should pay for lessons from\nThe lodge", "NTA.  \nNot sure where your friends are coming from, but can't they get husband to take lessons on those brush places to at least learn the basics? Then improve on real snow while there?  \n\n\nI know Dutch people who either go to a Snow World artificial snow place, or brush slopes to either learn or brush up. And the Netherlands is flat as a pancake, so... this has to be a thing in more places, right?", "NTA.\n\nYou're supposed to spend a couple of DAYS on the bunny hill with him? That's a *job*.\n\nI went snowboarding with my husband and I'm not good enough to keep up. We found another similarly mismatched pair of guys and \"traded partners\" so they could do something more challenging while we just didn't die on the green slopes.\n\nOne lesson would be understandable. \"Pizza, french fry, pizza, french fry.

She volunteered you without your permission, she doesn't get to be mad that you aren't willing to do it. The audacity.\n\nHave fun with the friends who aren't assholes!", "NTA.\n\nI'm an advanced skier myself and have run into this issue.  I'm a terrible teacher and don't have the patience to teach a total beginner.  I always, always recommend adult private lessons to folks looking to try it out.  You paid good money for your lift ticket and babysitting a beginner isn't what you signed up for.", "NTA", "NTA\n\n\"Okay ruin your own vacation over something I never promised and didn't know about.\"", "NTA. Just because you live here doesn't mean you should be expected to be an unpaid ski instructor.

If they don't want to come on the trip, then maybe it's for the best.", "Definitely NTA. First off, it is perfectly acceptable for you to want to ski with the group rather than babysit someone on beginner slopes. Secondly,  I  view teaching someone to ski as a big responsibility.  Leave it to people who have experience. He'll get better lessons, and you won't be blamed if he goes out and hurts himself.", "OP doesn't even say they do it for a living!   Their only qualifications are \"lives in Colorado\".  Honestly I wouldn't want the liability (just moral liability, I doubt there would be legal) of teaching a newby, even if I was an expert skier.  My friend broke her wrist during her first snowboarding lesson.  With a friend this entitled you KNOW she would be all like \"you have to pay for the hospital\".", "Honestly when I was a kid going out west and getting ski lessons was the best!  I remember instructors on the \"big hills\" were always really REALLY good compared to what we had back home on the bunny hills in the midwest."]}
