Im on mobile and im writing this while i am very upset, so please bear with me. \n\nI (F30) have gone NC with my family for about 7 years now.

My family has not contacted me except for one or two texts that I have ignored.\n\nMy partner(M27) has mentioned that it's not healthy to hold onto grudges and eventually I need to forgive them for my own mental health. I have told him before that I have no intention of talking to any of them again and told him to drop it. He was good about it until recently.\n\nA few days ago he sat me down and said, \"Listen, I know you'll say no, but your sister asked me if we want to go for coffee.\" I said absolutely fucking not, and not to tell me if they ask, because I will automatically say no. He said okay and then we moved on.\n\nToday, he mentioned that he was going for coffee with a friend. I thought nothing of it, so I just asked him with who. He became evasive and started making jokes about another gf (we do this all the time, it usually makes me laugh). This time though, I remembered the conversation about my sister asking to go for coffee. Immediately, I asked him if he was going with her. He sheepishly said yes. I said that I was very uncomfortable with this and I didn't want him to go. He said, \"You told me not to tell you if they ask again, and I did that. What's the problem?\" I was fucking livid. He left the house to go on his coffee date anyway.\n\nI gave him the silent treatment until about 10 min ago when he asked me something and I grumbled a reply.  He said, \"Why are you acting like this??\" And I exploded. I yelled at him saying that he didn't respect my boundaries and that he basically said \"fuck you\" and went for coffee with my sister anyway.

Now. NTA.\n\nAbsolute disrespect.", "NTA  He needs to respect your boundaries when it comes to your family.  You made it clear you want nothing to do with them.

I do think you should look into counseling OP. If you are having that big of a reaction (not that you are in the wrong for being upset at all but) after seven years I worry that you might be holding onto too much anger/hurt and that does hold negative health effects. You can heal without mending bridges though and what he did was seriously not respecting your boundaries.", "**NTA**   There is no way this will turn out well for you.\n\nWho the hell is he to decide what is or is not healthy for you?

Do not engage in arguments about why you are upset or listen to anything about how you are being unreasonable.   Tell him to get out and seek therapy for his god complex.

I have been NC with my entire family for almost 10 years(I left at 17). They were abusive physically and emotionally and my bio mother was extremely toxic with her narcissistic traits. Anyway, the husband kept pushing to contact them because it's \"family\". It took many arguments and horrible fights for him to drop it and I still resent him for having to fight so hard to have him respect my hard boundary. The fact that your partner STILL went ahead with that shows he has VERY little respect for you. And take it from someone 4 years into a marriage where the red flags began like that.....it does not get better. They will not change, and you will always be fighting for any kind of respect and understanding.

It sounds like he comes from a reasonably happy background and doesn't understand that abuse is not a mistake or a misunderstanding.

Your partner has no respect for you, which is why he happily ignores your boundaries. A man who thinks he can decide who you speak to would just as easily decide who you can't speak to.
