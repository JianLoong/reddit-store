He said okay and then we moved on.\n\nToday, he mentioned that he was going for coffee with a friend. I thought nothing of it, so I just asked him with who. He became evasive and started making jokes about another gf (we do this all the time, it usually makes me laugh). This time though, I remembered the conversation about my sister asking to go for coffee. Immediately, I asked him if he was going with her. He sheepishly said yes. I said that I was very uncomfortable with this and I didn't want him to go. He said, \"You told me not to tell you if they ask again, and I did that. What's the problem?\" I was fucking livid. He left the house to go on his coffee date anyway.\n\nI gave him the silent treatment until about 10 min ago when he asked me something and I grumbled a reply.  He said, \"Why are you acting like this??\" And I exploded.
