He wants you to suffer because he likes coming home to see you? You aren't a toy for his amusement.", "NTA. You're not giving him an ultimatum, you're just making alternate arrangements for your care while you are vulnerable and on bedrest. It's what you medically need to do because you need help at home for your own safety. \n\nHe's being extremely selfish. He \"wants to see you\" when you get home but doesn't want to make any concessions to ensure you have the basic home care you need. He can't have it both ways. Those are mutually exclusive things.\n\nWhy does his desire to see you when he gets home -- as if you were some pleasant house decoration for his viewing pleasure -- trump the safety of both you and the baby? He knows you don't just power down and turn into a doll the moment he goes to work, right? You have actual needs while he's not there and he either needs to meet them or let you meet them by staying elsewhere.", "NTA. \n\nYour on bed rest for a reason and overdoing it is dangerous to you and your unborn child.\n\nYou need support. Go to your mothers. Your husband can come see you there.\n\nAt this point baby comes first well before your husbands feelings and he might as well get on board with that because I suspect parenthood is going to be a pretty big shock for him.", "NTA. You found a solution to a problem, you tried to be conscious of how much he cares about his work, and you *need* support.", "NTA - You need help and he's not providing it. You have a plan for single motherhood, right?", "NTA, you and the baby's health come first, and you've been placed on bed rest.  That means stay in bed.  If your husband can't/won't take leave, and you can't/won't get help during the day, the logical choice is for you to go stay at your mother's.  Possibly she could come stay with you?  But your health comes first, however the situation is handled.  Your husband needs to put on his big boy pants and understand that medical orders are just that.", "NTA, in any way, shape, or form. \n\nYou have not given him an ultimatum. You have presented him with a *choice* between two very reasonable solutions to resolve something completely out of your control. \n\nThe fact that he seems to have little concern for your safety and that of your unborn child - and is more concerned with having his needs met (having you to come home to???) is incredibly concerning. HE is 100% the asshole in this situation. \n\nOne stranger to another ... I'm so glad that you seem to have a wonderful mother who is willing to step up to help you. \ud83d\udc99 Please go let her look after you and your baby right now.  \n\nMaybe this with be the very thing to get your husband's head out of his own ass - and realize that creating and raising a whole new life is going to require sacrifices from him as well.", "NTA Seriously, he works in health care but  does not understand bedrest?", "Spoiler: he won\u2019t take shorter days. Something will always magically come up. Anyone who gets paid leave and doesn\u2019t take it is a sucker who thinks his job will love him back. NTA", "NTA you make a fair argument. His job can function without him for awhile so he can be with you during this time. It\u2019s also not like you\u2019re LEAVING him. You\u2019re just going to your mother\u2019s so that you have someone to help you.", "You are NTA if you have legitimate reasons you would need the extra help from your mom. Also because he works in a hospital, wouldn't he better understand bed rest??", "NTA, \n\nThe situation you worked out allowed him to continue working, it is HIS issue that he \"wants to see you when he gets home\". He can't have it both ways. I get that his job can't just be dropped, but is he planning to take time after the baby is born?", "NTA\n\n\nWtf.\n\n\n\"I work an important job. I'm so important that your health needs come behind me liking you being home. Only I count\" ? Or what is he saying there?", "If your husband can't give you the (short-term) support you need during a difficult pregnancy, he should not begudge you  from getting that support elsewhere.  The health/safety of you and the baby trumps his need for company for the few hours he is home.", "NTA. You have a medical situation that requires you to need help functioning in your daily life. Either he makes the time to be that help, or accepts you getting it from someone else. Your health and comfort is the priority.", "NTA why is your health and comfort not even remotely a priority with him? Are you really prepared to have no help from him with your child?", "NTA. If you feel you need more help the closer you get to your due date, then you are 100% right to seek that help, and he has no right to stop you since it is for your own well being as well as the wellbeing of your unborn child. He sounds like a workaholic who needs to rethink his priorities. If he has paid leave, what's his issue? The hospital will not cease functionality if he takes time off to care for you, his wife. It wasn't so much of an ultimatum as it was common sense.", "NTA. For heaven's sake - he's a hospitalist! He knows better and is somehow convincing himself that what is pleasant for him needs to come first. Go to your mom's house - you really need her help. Your baby comes first. (Your small baby, not your big baby.)", "NTA. It is a no win situation. You should not be alone. Laying out the obvious alternatives, short of hiring a day nurse, does not make you a jerk.", "NTA. You're on bed rest. You need people around most if not all the time. He can't do that.  Go to your mom's. Baby is more important than his wants.", "NTA You're eight months pregnant on bedrest. Clearly, you need assistance so close to your due date. The man is a hospitalist who should be as understanding with his wife's needs as he is his patients. There's not really an ultimatum here. He either continues his rounds at the hospital while you get the care you need or he can take off. It's unreasonable for him to want you to stay home because \"he likes to come home and see you\". You're not a convenience, you're his pregnant wife carrying his child.", "NTA. \n\nBed rest isn't \"take bed rest if you can manage to swing it\". I'm sure he's genuine in that he is upset, but he needs to know that this is what is best for the baby. As others have said, as a doctor, he should understand this.\n\nAlso, it's for a fairly short amount of time. It's not like you will be staying at a different place for 6 months or forever- probably this last month, and maybe a couple weeks after birth as you recover. \n\nHe can adjust. Get some rest. And congratulations!\n\nSide note: If he truly has paid leave, I don't see a single issue. Maaaaybe if it were a month of unpaid leave. (Even then, he should figure something out) But since it is paid leave, he should just take the time off...", "NTA \u2014 bed rest is no joke! He\u2019s a hospitalist and he\u2019s acting like he doesn\u2019t know that? Come on. His comfort comes much further down the list at this point. Good luck with your pregnancy. Thank goodness you have help from your mom.", "NTA. You have a medical need and it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s being met. You can\u2019t even take a shower without someone having to monitor you and it\u2019s not really fair for him to expect you to wait that long to do all the daily survival things that humans do.", "NTA for your request but I am worried about what your husband will do once this child is born. If he has barely ben there since you first started dating, then this has become a habit and a habit that might not break just because you have a child. He might be by your side once you child is a baby, but I have a sense that he might not be present once you guys hit the kid or teenager stage. You should really sit down and talk to him about his future work schedule once this child is older.", "NTA.  He's being extremely SELFISH. It's unreal.", "NTA.\n\nYou and baby come first. If you're on bed rest he shouldn't be working long than 8 hours really. Whats his plan once baby is born though or will mum come and stay with you?", "NTA You need help and your husband is prioritizing helping patients over helping his own wife for a relatively short time. You need to take care of yourself and your husband is not stepping up to help you. He thinks you are being unfair in taking care of yourself? He needs an ultimatum just to get his attention. He is not giving you any choice but to go elsewhere for help since he is unwilling to provide it.", "I'm not convinced your husband even cares about your health. I hope you're ready to be a single parent with a completely absent father.\n\nThere was no ultimatum here. You're supposed to be on bed rest. That requires a carer. If he won't do it, your mom needs to. Your husband is absolutely horrible and abandoning you and emotionally abusing you during this very important time.\n\nNTA", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t have a choice if you go or not if he chooses work over you and the baby. He can come visit you at your mom\u2019s after work if he really wants to see you.", "NTA.  Your life and baby's life are at stake.  Husband's comfort is way down the list of priorities.\n\nGo to your mom's.", "Yes the fuck he can choose between supporting his pregnant wife and working 7 days a week. It's an easy choice! NTA OP, and good luck with the baby!", "NTA. You need more support than he can give right now. Is there a middle ground? Most hospitalists work one week and then are off the next - is that not an option for him so you could be with your family when he is on and with him when he\u2019s off?? If he\u2019s not willing to make these sacrifices now - I\u2019d be concerned things won\u2019t change once the new baby comes :(", "NTA what's so wrong to go to your mom for some days, it's not the end of world, you didn't break up and of course you will return when you give birth. NTA go to your mom, please.", "NTA. If he\u2019s not able to provide the support you need then you need to be somewhere else. Him taking that fact as a personal affront makes him the AH here. He works in a hospital so he should be aware of what \u201cbed rest\u201d means.", "NTA. Your solutions sound fair and reasonable. He's being selfish.", "Oh boy, you\u2019re gonna have two huge babies by next month.", "NTA. Go to mom\u2019s. Look for a place closer to where he works. He commutes 14 hours a week . No matter smaller or more expensive, setting each other more is more important.", "NTA but i'd be concidering leaving permanently.

Probably she doesn't WANT to be in hospital unnecessarily. \nI would absolutely rather be on bedrest at home, or at my mother's, or a friend's house, or anywhere other than hospital. \n\nAnd while she is allowed short periods of being up and about, she needs someone close enough to shout to if anything goes wrong.

First one, I was diagnosed around 31-ish weeks, spent several days in the hospital, came home on \"strict\" bedrest - which I spent puttering about and going to Walmart to get last minute things for the baby (just using a motorized cart instead of walking, absolutely no excuse but stubbornness). Then I spent the last little over a week before she was born in the hospital and at the end, I couldn't get out of the bed to even sit in the chair beside the bed... She was born at 35 weeks and spent 10 days in the NICU. We were lucky. It doesn't always end well. But my then husband was no help at all during this time. He was in school and working, but he didn't help when he was home. After she was home, the first day that I had her by myself was bad. No way around it. It was bad. Between pumping, feeding and changing her, I didn't even have time to eat. When ex got home 12 hours later, I had barely had time to use the bathroom. I hadn't eaten at all that day and was at the end of my rope. He came in and I became nearly hysterical telling him about our day. His only response was to go \"ok\" and off he went to take a shower.... Took many more years of virtual single parenting to finally move on. He's a better parent now than he was at any point while we were married.\n\nSecond baby with new DH was entirely different. Because of the known risk, I took baby aspirin after 12 weeks. It helped a lot and I didn't develop preeclampsia until 35.5 weeks. Spent only a week on bedrest, and he took off to make sure I actually stayed down. Got me everything I needed and helped me do everything. Our son was born at 37 weeks and was healthy. I had a c section and was able to hold him after they assessed him and carried him back to the room from the OR. They wrapped him tightly to me so that he was safe, but he wasn't whisked away by a nurse minutes after he was born to stay in the NICU. He stayed with me the whole time and went home with me 2 days later. DH made all the difference with our son's birth and afterwards. \n\nI say this to say that getting the help that you need now will make a huge difference in the outcome of your pregnancy. You and DH can keep up with each other over video calls and visits. But he either can't or won't be the help that you need right now. He's the one that needs to answer that.

I didn\u2019t listen. I had two toddlers, a newborn, and a husband who was in bed due to severe nerve damage from a motorcycle accident. My delivery was really hard on me. It was compounded by the fact that the doctor left part of the placenta behind. I was really sick. I didn\u2019t feel right, and I expressed that feeling to the nurses and doctors, who made me feel like I was crazy. Then I passed out. After imaging, an emergency surgery, and blood transfusions, I was told to stay in bed for two weeks. I almost died; according to the ER doctor I was 45 minutes from fully bleeding out.

If the doctors want you on bed rest, then there\u2019s a good reason for that. Listen to them. Your husband should understand. He should also be supporting you and your decisions. You are going to need help and support. I think staying at your moms is the best idea. You will be less likely to want to do things around the house if your at your moms. Mom will be there to help you in anyway you need. She will help comfort you, and care for baby in any way you need. She will make sure you eat and are being cared for. Ideally your husband would step up and be there for you. While I understand the love of his job, he needs to make you and baby the priority. He should not try to guilt you for wanting to do what is best for you and baby either.\n\nUnfortunately, your husband is T A. He\u2019s adding stress that you don\u2019t need. He either makes you, your health, and baby his priority\u2026or you stay with your mom for an unspecified amount of time. Hubby should be doing everything in his power to support you.

That is one of the better positions to have to be able to step away for a period of time, he has no patient panel that he has to manage, the position is designed for the provider to take care of the patient while they are inpatient, then get them out of the hospital and back with their primary providers for long-term management.
