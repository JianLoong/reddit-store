I told him he\u2019d either have to take his paid leave at work till the end of my pregnancy, or I was leaving.  He got upset and said I couldn\u2019t make him choose between those things, and that he could take shorter days, but he worked an important job and couldn\u2019t pick up and go.

He wants you to suffer because he likes coming home to see you? You aren't a toy for his amusement.", "NTA. You're not giving him an ultimatum, you're just making alternate arrangements for your care while you are vulnerable and on bedrest. It's what you medically need to do because you need help at home for your own safety. \n\nHe's being extremely selfish. He \"wants to see you\" when you get home but doesn't want to make any concessions to ensure you have the basic home care you need. He can't have it both ways. Those are mutually exclusive things.\n\nWhy does his desire to see you when he gets home -- as if you were some pleasant house decoration for his viewing pleasure -- trump the safety of both you and the baby? He knows you don't just power down and turn into a doll the moment he goes to work, right? You have actual needs while he's not there and he either needs to meet them or let you meet them by staying elsewhere.", "NTA. \n\nYour on bed rest for a reason and overdoing it is dangerous to you and your unborn child.\n\nYou need support. Go to your mothers. Your husband can come see you there.\n\nAt this point baby comes first well before your husbands feelings and he might as well get on board with that because I suspect parenthood is going to be a pretty big shock for him.", "NTA. You found a solution to a problem, you tried to be conscious of how much he cares about his work, and you *need* support.", "NTA - You need help and he's not providing it. You have a plan for single motherhood, right?", "NTA, you and the baby's health come first, and you've been placed on bed rest.  That means stay in bed.  If your husband can't/won't take leave, and you can't/won't get help during the day, the logical choice is for you to go stay at your mother's.  Possibly she could come stay with you?  But your health comes first, however the situation is handled.  Your husband needs to put on his big boy pants and understand that medical orders are just that.", "NTA, in any way, shape, or form. \n\nYou have not given him an ultimatum. You have presented him with a *choice* between two very reasonable solutions to resolve something completely out of your control. \n\nThe fact that he seems to have little concern for your safety and that of your unborn child - and is more concerned with having his needs met (having you to come home to???) is incredibly concerning. HE is 100% the asshole in this situation. \n\nOne stranger to another ... I'm so glad that you seem to have a wonderful mother who is willing to step up to help you. \ud83d\udc99 Please go let her look after you and your baby right now.  \n\nMaybe this with be the very thing to get your husband's head out of his own ass - and realize that creating and raising a whole new life is going to require sacrifices from him as well.", "NTA Seriously, he works in health care but  does not understand bedrest?", "Spoiler: he won\u2019t take shorter days. Something will always magically come up. Anyone who gets paid leave and doesn\u2019t take it is a sucker who thinks his job will love him back. NTA", "NTA you make a fair argument. His job can function without him for awhile so he can be with you during this time. It\u2019s also not like you\u2019re LEAVING him. You\u2019re just going to your mother\u2019s so that you have someone to help you.", "You are NTA if you have legitimate reasons you would need the extra help from your mom. Also because he works in a hospital, wouldn't he better understand bed rest??", "NTA, \n\nThe situation you worked out allowed him to continue working, it is HIS issue that he \"wants to see you when he gets home\". He can't have it both ways. I get that his job can't just be dropped, but is he planning to take time after the baby is born?", "NTA\n\n\nWtf.\n\n\n\"I work an important job. I'm so important that your health needs come behind me liking you being home. Only I count\" ? Or what is he saying there?", "If your husband can't give you the (short-term) support you need during a difficult pregnancy, he should not begudge you  from getting that support elsewhere.  The health/safety of you and the baby trumps his need for company for the few hours he is home.", "NTA. You have a medical situation that requires you to need help functioning in your daily life. Either he makes the time to be that help, or accepts you getting it from someone else. Your health and comfort is the priority.", "NTA why is your health and comfort not even remotely a priority with him? Are you really prepared to have no help from him with your child?", "NTA. If you feel you need more help the closer you get to your due date, then you are 100% right to seek that help, and he has no right to stop you since it is for your own well being as well as the wellbeing of your unborn child. He sounds like a workaholic who needs to rethink his priorities. If he has paid leave, what's his issue? The hospital will not cease functionality if he takes time off to care for you, his wife. It wasn't so much of an ultimatum as it was common sense.", "NTA. For heaven's sake - he's a hospitalist! He knows better and is somehow convincing himself that what is pleasant for him needs to come first. Go to your mom's house - you really need her help. Your baby comes first. (Your small baby, not your big baby.)", "NTA. It is a no win situation. You should not be alone. Laying out the obvious alternatives, short of hiring a day nurse, does not make you a jerk.", "NTA. You're on bed rest. You need people around most if not all the time. He can't do that.  Go to your mom's. Baby is more important than his wants.", "NTA You're eight months pregnant on bedrest. Clearly, you need assistance so close to your due date. The man is a hospitalist who should be as understanding with his wife's needs as he is his patients. There's not really an ultimatum here. He either continues his rounds at the hospital while you get the care you need or he can take off. It's unreasonable for him to want you to stay home because \"he likes to come home and see you\". You're not a convenience, you're his pregnant wife carrying his child.", "NTA. \n\nBed rest isn't \"take bed rest if you can manage to swing it\". I'm sure he's genuine in that he is upset, but he needs to know that this is what is best for the baby. As others have said, as a doctor, he should understand this.\n\nAlso, it's for a fairly short amount of time. It's not like you will be staying at a different place for 6 months or forever- probably this last month, and maybe a couple weeks after birth as you recover. \n\nHe can adjust. Get some rest. And congratulations!\n\nSide note: If he truly has paid leave, I don't see a single issue. Maaaaybe if it were a month of unpaid leave. (Even then, he should figure something out) But since it is paid leave, he should just take the time off...", "NTA \u2014 bed rest is no joke! He\u2019s a hospitalist and he\u2019s acting like he doesn\u2019t know that? Come on. His comfort comes much further down the list at this point. Good luck with your pregnancy. Thank goodness you have help from your mom.", "NTA. You have a medical need and it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s being met. You can\u2019t even take a shower without someone having to monitor you and it\u2019s not really fair for him to expect you to wait that long to do all the daily survival things that humans do.", "NTA for your request but I am worried about what your husband will do once this child is born. If he has barely ben there since you first started dating, then this has become a habit and a habit that might not break just because you have a child. He might be by your side once you child is a baby, but I have a sense that he might not be present once you guys hit the kid or teenager stage. You should really sit down and talk to him about his future work schedule once this child is older.", "NTA.  He's being extremely SELFISH. It's unreal.", "NTA.\n\nYou and baby come first. If you're on bed rest he shouldn't be working long than 8 hours really. Whats his plan once baby is born though or will mum come and stay with you?", "NTA You need help and your husband is prioritizing helping patients over helping his own wife for a relatively short time. You need to take care of yourself and your husband is not stepping up to help you. He thinks you are being unfair in taking care of yourself? He needs an ultimatum just to get his attention. He is not giving you any choice but to go elsewhere for help since he is unwilling to provide it.", "I'm not convinced your husband even cares about your health. I hope you're ready to be a single parent with a completely absent father.\n\nThere was no ultimatum here. You're supposed to be on bed rest. That requires a carer. If he won't do it, your mom needs to. Your husband is absolutely horrible and abandoning you and emotionally abusing you during this very important time.\n\nNTA", "NTA. He doesn\u2019t have a choice if you go or not if he chooses work over you and the baby. He can come visit you at your mom\u2019s after work if he really wants to see you.", "NTA.  Your life and baby's life are at stake.  Husband's comfort is way down the list of priorities.\n\nGo to your mom's.", "Yes the fuck he can choose between supporting his pregnant wife and working 7 days a week. It's an easy choice! NTA OP, and good luck with the baby!", "NTA. You need more support than he can give right now. Is there a middle ground? Most hospitalists work one week and then are off the next - is that not an option for him so you could be with your family when he is on and with him when he\u2019s off?? If he\u2019s not willing to make these sacrifices now - I\u2019d be concerned things won\u2019t change once the new baby comes :(", "NTA what's so wrong to go to your mom for some days, it's not the end of world, you didn't break up and of course you will return when you give birth. NTA go to your mom, please.", "NTA. If he\u2019s not able to provide the support you need then you need to be somewhere else. Him taking that fact as a personal affront makes him the AH here. He works in a hospital so he should be aware of what \u201cbed rest\u201d means.", "NTA. Your solutions sound fair and reasonable. He's being selfish.", "Oh boy, you\u2019re gonna have two huge babies by next month.", "NTA. Go to mom\u2019s. Look for a place closer to where he works. He commutes 14 hours a week . No matter smaller or more expensive, setting each other more is more important.", "NTA but i'd be concidering leaving permanently.

You're a keyboard warrior and what you wrote is simply false and there's TONS of admissions data and long term outcome data that show exactly the opposite of what you wrote. I literally currently work (as an actual doctor, not just someone who once got injured and read up on medicine) at one of the top 5 hospitals systems in the world and we get data from all over the state and country - we have a floor full of women on hospital bedrest, and actually it's great business for the hospital in addition to being good for patients. I still say OP is NTA, but you are for your rampant misinformation", "NAH\n\nI worked till the last day prior to my children being born and then took my leave. My wife\u2019s and my family came over to support her. There was no need for her to move in with someone else. That seems kind of dumb to me.

This is a pregnant woman on bedrest, close to her due date, who needs her mother's help, and you think the husband is right?

You suck.", "Whatever troll.", "He can choose to take paid leave off.\n\nAssuming it's not a \"he will  be unable to support our family unless he goes to work\" situation, your wife takes priority over work\n\nI'd certainly take time off to take care of a sick husband. And yes family can help, but the point is it's a *partnership*\n\n\nI'm sorry but it shows his priorities. He cares more about his work than his wife. And if that's the case, I'd be off to the lawyers.", "Your generalizing in the presence of an actual human being with her own specific physical makeup, a living individual patient who is not a flat data point to be forced into your flawed analytical framework, is not helping anyone.  Some patients did not need to be on strict bedrest.  Some did.  Some still do.  If she's been told she can't shower alone, then she can't shower alone.  You don't have the authority to override her doctor's orders.  And Y are definitely T A here, telling a woman in a high-risk pregnancy to chill and do what you think she should be doing.", "This really is going to depend where you are located. \nIn a for profit hospital model. Yeah, having patients who are just there because they are on. Nearest is a great deal. \n\nBut in countries with health systems that are funded by the government it is terrible and they cannot afford to have whole wards full of those patients. In an emergency, yes, they will. A friend of mine spent a week or so in hospital bedrest because she had triplets, one wasn't doing great and the risk of her being on bedrest at home, 15min away from the hospital where too great. \n\nBut ignoring any arguments about whether or not it is technically possible or profitable for a hospital to have her there.... Probably she doesn't WANT to be in hospital unnecessarily. \nI would absolutely rather be on bedrest at home, or at my mother's, or a friend's house, or anywhere other than hospital. \n\nAnd while she is allowed short periods of being up and about, she needs someone close enough to shout to if anything goes wrong. If she falls in the shower, or starts to bleed profusely in bed or while making herself some food. Sure she can keep her phone always within reach to call an ambulance. But then does she need to crawl downstairs to unlock the door? \nIf he is working 16 hour days an hour away, he isn't getting home fast enough to help her. And he is unlikely having time to pre prep food for himself and her so she isn't standing and working in the kitchen, do the laundry, clean the house. \n\nNTA OP - but her husband is and you too for only being focused on if a hospital can make money out of shoving a pregnant woman in a bed so OP can continue to ignore his wife and mother of the baby with total disregard for her preference and comfort\n\nEdit - mixed up op and husband", "You are one doctor in one hospital system.  I was trained in the Ivies with multiple degrees to study and compare how doctors in the West and in Asia and elsewhere since the 18th century until now were trained to think the way they do, how their minds and praxes are formed to get some things right and some things wrong, as is always the case with humans.  And you are not THIS specific woman's doctor.   Are you even in ob/gyn?  We who study you (and are very grateful for the work you do, choosing to put your bodies and minds to the service of so many other people) see the specialties becoming ever more inundated with data in their own fields and unable to keep up as they were a generation or two ago before the internet and English replacing German as the primary research language sped up the rate and quantity of publication in English.  The people who were not epidemiologists or virologists spouting off about what to do or not do with COVID were a case in point.  And you assumed that I am just a \"keyboard warrior\" who is spreading \"misinformation.\"  Your condescension is appalling.\n\nI'm sure you give good care to your own patients, but your tone is very dismissive of her concerns and on top of that, your remarks are supporting an abusive husband not doing what needs to be done to support his wife in a mix of mental and physical stressors.\n\nPerhaps you are in a more advanced and sophisticated medical system than we have in the U.S., where white women are three times more likely to die from pregnancy, delivery, and post-partum complications, and black women are even more likely to die, from potential complications that Europeans handle far better in their populations.  I was fortunate to be treated for a high-risk pregnancy in Europe over three decades ago, then came back to the U.S. and saw the primitive level of care here and wanted to fly straight back to Europe.  That encounter with two distinct levels of expertise, technology, and ethics sparked me to add this part of history of science and medicine to my research.   If you are in the U.S. and dismissing an at-risk pregnancy so cavalierly, well, you're part of this problem:  [https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/us-maternal-mortality-crisis-continues-worsen-international-comparison](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2022/us-maternal-mortality-crisis-continues-worsen-international-comparison)  edited for typos.

My feelings matters more!!!!! Your family should pack their shit, move in even though they're already generous in giving you help! You should just deal with the fact that you're all suffering because it makes me *upset*. How dare you prioritise both your health and your family over my FEELINGS? \n\nIn fact despite the fact that you're in pain and sick and your family is already going out of their way to offer help I will make Everything worse by making you feel bad about not prioritising ME.

Both of them are assholes and ignorant kinda.", "We don't know where OP is from but the US has a massive issue with maternal mortality rates. And being on bed rest is serious - she could go into early labor, develop preeclampsia, etc. Babies and mothers can and do die. If she goes into preeclampsia and she's alone she could have a seizure or a stroke if no one is around to notice her symptoms. \n\nAnd you keep making comments about how you shouldn't have a kid if you didn't plan on it but it sounds like her husband just hoped everything would work out perfectly and he wouldn't have to take any time off and that's unacceptable. \n\nEven completely healthy pregnancies can turn into disasters quickly. \n\nShe could get to full term and go into labor naturally and the cord could get hung up necessitating an emergency csection.

If he works at a hospital he's basically got the world's biggest job security unless he's a massive fuck up.\n\nSo it's very simple. He wants to work more than he cares about his wife.\n\nHer (very gracious!!!!) solution is to just love with her parents.\n\nLiterally this man prioritised his work over his wife.
