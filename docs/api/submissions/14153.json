And yeah, giving the niece the larges spare room to herself while a family of 3 has to share the smaller room is still a bit rude. Depending on just how much the family *actually* favors the niece over everyone else it is probably a YTA, but again, grief does **things** to people, like possibly cause them to place the orphaned child of the favored son/daughter on a golden pedestal and let them get away with murder, or a recent example is cancelling all birthdays **forever** after a 17yo died on his.", "I'm sure she'd give up having a large room for herself if that meant she could be a in a small room with her parents.  You have to spend a few days in a small room with your husband and daughter, she'll never see her parents again for the rest of her life.  No matter what hurt you and your family feel over having to spend a vacation in a small you room you are not paying for will never amount to the hurt she has over being an orphan", "You know what REALLY hurts kids?

Shame on you", "Where did I say she shouldn't have a nice room? The room we were staying in was also nice but it was smaller and better for one person than 3", "Omg such a good point!!!", "Well, normally, yes, that is logical, but first off she is going through a rough time and your BIL is trying to make her feel better. Secondly, it\u2019s not your house - you can request but your issue is that you feel entitled to decide how rooms get split up. If you don\u2019t like it, you can always leave. That is the reason everybody in your family is calling you an AH. Finally, given how cold heartedly you talk about your niece, logical or not, nobody feels bad for you because you\u2019re being beyond an AH. At this point I don\u2019t think you should get the larger room. You can be cramped and when your daughter asks why, you can tell her it\u2019s the consequence of being so unfeeling towards your orphan niece.\n\nEdit for typos", "I\u2019m going NTA.\n\nNiece needs therapy, support, empathy, compassion. What she doesn\u2019t need is a bigger room than 3 people sharing. Yes it\u2019s the BILs house but he\u2019s an AH giving niece that message. Just because her parents are dead doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t be spoiled. And this kind of behaviour of orphan = get everything you want is not going to be setting her up well for later life when her entitlement won\u2019t wash with others. \n\nETA2, in OPs original post her initial reaction was can 15yo share? She\u2019s not jealous of niece as some suggested she\u2019s fighting for equality for her own daughter. Some comments say \u2018she\u2019s an orphan,\u2019 so what?! And that \u2018this really changes things,\u2019  how? The orphan part doesn\u2019t relate to the situation at all other than to explain In laws favouritism. It shouldn\u2019t mean niece is entitled to more than her cousin. One year difference between them, they should be treat equally. \n\nAnd what message is his clear favouritism sending to OPs daughter? She doesn\u2019t matter because she has living parents? The grandparents (since niece lives with them) and uncle favour niece and poor OPs daughter is left out. She\u2019s going to grow up knowing she doesn\u2019t matter to extended family. A 15 yo having to share the smallest room with her parents rather than the biggest one with her cousin is unfair. I\u2019m guessing one of them is on a sofa bed or something. \nETA 15 YO dad favours niece too!?! That poor girl. She has no-one but mom in her corner. This is going to affect her so much growing up. And yes the niece will find things hard and traumatic due to her parents passing but that is now unpreventable and can only be managed with therapy, support and time (not spoiling her). What is preventable is the damage to 15yo due to overt favouritism. \n\nOp you can\u2019t really do anything cause it\u2019s BILs house and you just really have to respect his rules unless you find your own accommodation.
