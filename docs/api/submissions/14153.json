Secondly, it\u2019s not your house - you can request but your issue is that you feel entitled to decide how rooms get split up. If you don\u2019t like it, you can always leave. That is the reason everybody in your family is calling you an AH. Finally, given how cold heartedly you talk about your niece, logical or not, nobody feels bad for you because you\u2019re being beyond an AH.

What she doesn\u2019t need is a bigger room than 3 people sharing. Yes it\u2019s the BILs house but he\u2019s an AH giving niece that message. Just because her parents are dead doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t be spoiled. And this kind of behaviour of orphan = get everything you want is not going to be setting her up well for later life when her entitlement won\u2019t wash with others. \n\nAnd what message is his clear favouritism sending to OPs daughter? She doesn\u2019t matter because she has living parents? The grandparents (since niece lives with them) and uncle favour niece and poor OPs daughter is left out. She\u2019s going to grow up knowing she doesn\u2019t matter to extended family. A 15 yo having to share the smallest room with her parents rather than the biggest one with her cousin is unfair. I\u2019m guessing one of them is on a sofa bed or something. \nETA 15 YO dad favours niece too!?! That poor girl. She has no-one but mom in her corner. This is going to affect her so much growing up. And yes the niece will find things hard and traumatic due to her parents passing but that is now unpreventable and can only be managed with therapy, support and time (not spoiling her). What is preventable is the damage to 15yo due to overt favouritism. \n\nOp you can\u2019t really do anything cause it\u2019s BILs house and you just really have to respect his rules unless you find your own accommodation.

OP is acting entitled and jealous.", "OP doesnt get to demand anything of anyone. She can get a hotel room for all i care and she should have. Its not her house", "She\u2019s defending her daughter from being punished for having parents.", "Oh I think she\u2019s got a lot of resentment built up, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s wrong.", "Staying in the same room with your parents on a trip is being punished?  So you\u2019re saying that when you travel (assuming you have or will have kids), you\u2019re going to book them their own hotel room so they won\u2019t be punished by staying in the same room as you?\n\nJust asked my 13 yr old if she considers staying in the same room as us on a trip as punishment and she gave me a \u201cyou\u2019re being weird, mom\u201d look and said No.", "It might just be the way I\u2019m interpreting it, but she says she \u201ctold\u201d the BIL instead of asking - it doesn\u2019t seem like this was a calm and reasonable conversation.

She\u2019s sad from her parents passing, needs therapy, needs support, needs compassion. She doesn\u2019t need the biggest room at the expense of 3 other people squashed into the smallest. Especially a 15 yo who\u2019s own dad prefers the niece and is being punished for having parents.", "Family gatherings are hard when you\u2019ve lost a member of your family.
