That makes sense.\n\nGet the survey, have the fence installed.  Don\u2019t install a gate where this guy would want it\u2026 just a fence.", "NTA. \n\nDefinitely one of those awkward neighbor situations. \ud83d\ude15 Do it sooner than later. You don\u2019t want it to look like you are okay with him driving on your property. In my experience if you give neighbors an inch, they take a mile. \n\n(Note - sometimes people are allowed access across private property to reach their land. Basically an access easement. That doesn\u2019t sound like that is applicable in this situation but worth confirming.)", "It doesn\u2019t matter if you an asshole, you need legal advice", "If that was the case, thst should have disclosed immediately.", "Thanks, will do.

If nothing is recorded, there's no easement.  \n  \nYou need to inform your neighbor, in writing, that your land is private property and he is to immediately cease trespassing on it.  Send the letter certified mail and keep a copy of it.  If he does it again, try and get footage, call the cops, show them the letter and the footage, and have him trespassed from your land.  If he does it again, call the cops and have him arrested.", "NTA. My neighbor cuts across my driveway from his backyard to his front driveway and has caused a huge rut in my driveway from cutting over. I feel your frustration. You asked him not to do it and he refused.", "NTA - I have been through two neighbors getting fences in the last 12 months. One on each side - mutual both times.  Here is how the one new neighbor did it, and we appreciated it.  We got a cover letter, letting us know they were putting in a new shared fence, they attached a copy of the survey and the permit as well as a copy of the installers insurance liability. We ended up getting a new gate put in so they match across, it looks really nice.     \n\n\nWe gained three feet, three feet of unmaintained overgrown - but that is a story for another day.  They wanted the fence to be put up on their legal line not what had been accepted.  So we were like ok.  Which is what you are doing.  The thing is, your neighbor is going to be ticked off, but that is on him.  We had a ton of work to do when the fence was moved but in the end it was better for everyone and in your case  you won't have to be 'reminding' him that he is  on your property.  You are not looking for life long friendship you are looking to be respected as a homeowner and there is nothing wrong with that.", "NTA\n\nMorally you aren\u2019t obligated to continue an agreement he had with the previous owner.\n\nHe will still have access to his backyard - he just won\u2019t have *vehicle* access. Which is his problem to work out, not yours. \n\n> he uses my driveway to access his backyard with his truck by driving between our houses\n\nI would find this HIGHLY annoying.", "NTA\n\nGood fences make good neighbors", "Doubt he had permission, he just did it to the previous owners like he is doing to you.  Fences make good neighbors.", "And make sure that there's some very strong, almost dare I say potentially truck damaging, fence-posts in the exact middle of where he drives.

Due to the number of years the neighbor has been using your yard it seems he might have a case. The last thing you want is to put up a fence and then end up in a lengthy court battle to have to tear the fence down.", "NTA - what's he doing back there, burying bodies?", "NTA\n\nGet your fence. Don't let him destroy your yard. \n\nWhen I bought my house, I noticed it had a tall fence on one side. My neighbors told me that the person who lived behind me used to drive through my next door neighbor's yard to park in back of his house. He was, apparently, a surly sort, so when asking did no good, they put up a fence.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nHe is for not respecting your property.", "I have a small permanent easement because of the way the original builder put my stairs in. It's recorded in the county land files. If it's not recorded, at least in the States, it doesn't exist.", "NTA you don't have any agreements and I would get it surveyed. Before then I would put up signs.", "Nta. Verbal agreements between property owners end when one owners leaves. If there was a contract that should have been disclosed on the purchase contract. Get your survey done and a nice sturdy fence built.", "My parents found themselves in a similar situation with a neighbor. While there was no recorded easement, the neighbors had been taking advantage of the situation for many years. When my parents sold their home, the neighbors essentially claimed \u201csquatters\u2019 rights\u201d on the portion of the property they used to access their garage. My parents won in the end, but it was a legal hassle!"]}
