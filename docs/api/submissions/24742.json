My dad cheated and left her for another women, leaving my younger brother, Josh (21M), and me with our mom. He abandoned us, only returning when our grandma informed him we were calling another man \"dad.\"\n\nWhen Dad reentered our lives, he introduced us to his new family: two stepsisters from different fathers and my half-brother Tom (17M) whom he had with his current wife. Although we spent every weekend together initially, visits became less frequent over time because of Dad's work.\n\nYears later, things fell apart between him and his new wife after discovering she was cheating. Now living separately and sharing custody of Tom with his ex-wife Maria, my father eventually bought a house just minutes away from them. I always assumed it was because of his deep attachment to Tom.\n\nRecently, Dad hosted more gatherings, inviting Maria as well as Richard, the man she cheated on him with\u2014who also happens to be an alcoholic with three daughters. Despite feeling uncomfortable, I kept my feelings to myself until last week's birthday celebration for my grandma.\n\nWith Maria and Richard once again in attendance, I decided to speak up about their presence at our family events and how Richard makes both me and my girlfriend uncomfortable with his inappropriate interactions (touches and greets me and my girlfriend weird and touchy -hands too close to waist, staring at my girls breasts).\n\nI've been wanting to bring this up to my dad for the past year but he's always intoxicated or finds and excuse to avoid convo so at the end of the night I decided to tell my dad that I respect she's the mother of Tom and will be in his life until the end but I would appreciate it he didn't invite her to OUR family events AND her new partner who gives me the creeps. He took it very wrong, started yelling at me and caused a scene at my grandmas party, Josh saw how he was speaking to me and told him to calm down, he got aggressive and I started yelling \"why would you want this whore and the man she cheated on you with at OUR family events.\" My dad was furious when I name called her and stated Tom is behind I had no idea he dint know his mom cheated and left our dad for Richard and when I called his mom a whore he was crying.\n\nTo clarify: \nThis was AFTER the cake was cut and guests have left, I wanted my grandparents there as witnesses since my dad had been drinking so it was only my 2 brothers, grandparents and girlfriend present. \nHe has every right to invite anyone to his place I get that, but he invites them to events hosted by MY family (aunt, uncle, grandmas) in the past without even asking and shocking everyone with their presence. \n\nAITA for calling his ex wife a w\\*\\*\\*e in front of Tom and expressing my discomfort?", "created_utc": 1692140072, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15s7vaj/aita_for_calling_my_dads_exwife_a_we_in_front_of/", "score": 105, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should have had this discussion with your dad privately some other time. Also, calling her names wasn\u2019t necessary. Your dad is an AH for making you feel abandoned and like you aren\u2019t a priority, that\u2019s probably one reason you\u2019re lashing out at his ex-wife. She obviously sucks for cheating, though your dad doesn\u2019t sound all that innocent himself and I\u2019d bet he cheated on her too. I feel bad for your half brother, who never asked to be born in such a messed up situation.", "ESH. You shouldn\u2019t have to hang around anyone that can\u2019t be anything but intoxicated. You should have this conversation elsewhere though. There was no reason to be callous towards Maria with her son nearby.", "ESH. Don't have a big confrontation at a party and don't call women whores.", "NTA, Tom is 17, and you were more than patient with your dad considering how Richard treated your girlfriend. You really cannot be expected to just take all this and remain calm.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t need to call her a whore. Inappropriate language was\u2026inappropriate. Don\u2019t call women whores. Use your words and express your feelings in other ways. \n\nPlus dude, it was her husband that you have a problem with. Why not address his behavior directly? Calling his wife a whore does not address him staring at your gf\u2019s breasts. If I were your gf I would feel even more uncomfortable after hearing you insult his wife.", "YTA. You don't got to decide who comes to events hosted by other people, even if those people are family. Believe it or not, they may have their own reasons for wanting to include someone, even if you don't care for them. You can choose to go or not, but while there, suck it up.\n\nYou only get to choose the guest list if you're hosting.", "Look, I get that it's technically a family event, but he's hosting, and he gets to invite who he wants because of that.

You have every right to make it known that you don\u2019t appreciate them being invited to events that have nothing to do with them but you had no reason to start shit at your grandmas party, nor did you have a reason to call her a whore. Your beef is with your dad - who can invite whoever he wants when he\u2019s hosting.", "YTA. This was a conversation you have in private with your father. Not at a party in front of everyone, while your dad was drunk. Like, seriously, what exactly did you expect to happen?\n\nI get why you don\u2019t want to spend time with your father\u2019s awful guests, but you really went about it the only way.
