They are probably the best bet on being able to tell you how to get copies of documentation made by the staff about your exs outburst.\n\nI feel so bad for your son. Passing out randomly is absolutely terrifying. The fact that he was out for so long is worrisome as well. I truly hope they get him diagnosed and treated soon. I will say, if they have him on a cardiac monitor in the hospital try and do normal tasks as much as he can. If he's allowed, have him walk the halls with you. Make him get up to do small tasks that he can. This might help them get more information about why he passed out. I've been passing out for around 20 years and it never gets less scary. Make sure he knows that you love him and are there for him. For a while my dad didn't believe I actually passed out. Since we didn't live together and he didn't usually see me go down. That made it a lot more rough for me when they were trying to diagnose and treat me. Being a teenager and knowing that your actual parent doesn't believe you is really, really rough. You start wondering if you are somehow making it up or causing it to happen. I'm so glad your son has you. I had my mom and it's literally the only reason I am still alive.\n\nOn a side note: Stuffies are an amazing comfort item. Both in the hospital and out. Sometimes just being able to hold onto something can help you get back to normal. Also, hospitals get boring, so ya'll can play catch with the stuffie to try and pass some of the time. I also used to put the sides of the bed up and raise the bed as high as I could. I thought it was hilarious as a teenager.

She doesn't deserve sympathy, and she doesn't deserve pity. She fucked up, several times over, and she has the audacity to feign the victim afterwards? Hell, she outright lied about your involvement in the situation to probably make herself look better. Her behaviour in this whole episode is reprehensible.\n\nFrankly the fact that she fucked right off into the aether when she got told off just says a lot about where her priorities are.

She had, as stated above, many opportunities to inform you of what was happening to your son. She chose not to. \n\nFurthermore, she decided it was a brilliant idea to lie to everyone in her life about you being informed and not giving a f*ck about your son, likely to make herself look better for some reason. \n\nAnd because that wasn\u2019t enough to win bat sh*t crazy mother of the year, she decided to yell at your sick son while he is sitting in a hospital bed not knowing why he is sick. \n\nDo not feel guilty. Whatever anyone is saying is bullsh*t. Remember, they also likely do not have the full true story. Not that it\u2019s any of their business. \n\nPlease do not let what you said to your ex be an empty threat. Talk to your lawyer about modifying your custody agreement.

If possible, have your sister in law inform your lawyer that she was the one who actually informed you of everything that was happening. \n\nI say this because you obviously don\u2019t know if this is a pattern of behavior. She may have already been treating all of your children like burdens and yelling at them for anything they may have needed/wanted. You need to speak to your children to see if this is something that has been ongoing. You need to know if your son was feeling I\u2019ll before this incident and your ex denied him medical care; that is medical neglect. \n\nThis situation is not to be taken lightly.
