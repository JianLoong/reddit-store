Before marriage, we talked about me managing our money since he admitted that he is not very good with it. Everytime I buy something for our kid and in the house or even for myself, I let him know just for account and we know where the money goes. I also work full time, but on maternity leave at the moment ( I earn more than him if that is relevant). It has been an issue for us, that he always use up his allowance really soon before payday, and I have to give him top up everytime. I just had enough!\n\nThis morning he just called me 10 minutes after going to work and ask for my pin number in my debit card. I ask why, and he said that he is in the ATM machine, withdrawing 20\u00a3 from my card. I became really angry, because of the fact that he stole the card from my wallet, didn\u2019t tell me anything about it and expecting me to just go with it. He came back home, refuse to go to work until I give him the money. I refuse and said some not so good things to him out of anger. I told him, it\u2019s not even about the money anymore but, trust is already broken.\nHe said technically it\u2019s our money and he is entitled to it as well, and he will pay me back when the salary comes. But I was thinking, that if I give in now, this attitude will keep coming back. He also said that because of the mere 20\u00a3, he might end up losing his job( he was 1 hour late due to our argument).\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: He has his own account where he would leave money as his monthly budget, and give the rest to me. He will have another allowance next week for the next salary. The 20\u00a3 is another issue.\n\nEdit: I also have an income ( maternity pay in UK) not that much but enough to pay all the bills even with my salary. His salary is for food and childcare needs.\n\nEdit: After 8 hours, he came back from work, and I prepared a whiteboard with all our expenses and savings. He was very apologetic and We eventually decided that we will separate expenses, and he will manage his own money. I get the YTA votes, and I don\u2019t want him to be financially abused in any way( if it really was an abuse).", "created_utc": 1692269084, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15tjtd0/aita_for_standing_my_ground_and_not_giving_my/", "score": 1246, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Stealing your card is WAY too far.\n\nI say this as someone who nearly destroyed my marriage due to financial infidelity (undiagnosed mental illness issues) this seems like digging deeper while trying to dig out. Meaning, he did something so stupid and desperate without thinking about the consequences it makes me think he is a hole of some kind and grasping at straws to get back to neutral. Borrowed money from a buddy who is now demanding it back or else, \"borrowed\" money without asking that he planned to pay back but never really worked out how and is at risk of getting caught, etc...

Have one for your own spending money- give yourself the same as him. Then another for bills- included in bills is a budget for baby, food, house etc which can all be tracked in a spending app. Then another for savings- everything within there should be categorised eg christmas savings, holiday savings. But that can all be written out rather than separate accounts.\n\nIf he wants an extra \u00a320, don\u2019t say no. Instead ask him which area of the budget you should take it from. Does he want to skip paying his phone bill this month? Is he suggesting you don\u2019t buy as much food? Is he taking it from baby\u2019s budget? And if he gets \u00a320 out the christmas savings, you also get \u00a320 out the savings to keep it fair. He\u2019ll soon realise his requests are unreasonable.\n\nIt might be a bit extra work for you to track everything. But I track everything and it actually makes things less stressful overall and I realise where I am spending money that could be saved. It also means that if anything happens to me, like if I\u2019m sick or anything, my partner has all the information needed to take over looking after the money and making sure the bills are all paid, etc. And if he has any questions about where the joint money is going- I have all the information to answer without having to rely on my memory.

Is your husband out of his mind to come back home, rather than continuing to go to work? If he loses his job, it's his responsibility, nobody else's.\n\nI have a strong finance background and in my experience the following arrangement usually works very well: \n\na) Both partners have their own Current Account and their own Savings Account. \nb) One Joint Account for monthly bills and expenses. c) Children's Savings accounts. \n\n1. Add together all monthly incomes.\n2. Add together all monthly expenses, including mortgage/rent, household bills, taxes, childcare costs, kids' clothing, grocery bills, vehicle costs, pet costs, etc.\n3. Deduct the total monthly expenses from the total monthly income. \n4. If you have debt to repay, repay the highest interest ones first ASAP.\n5. Decide on a regular monthly payment into your savings accounts and your children's accounts.\n6. Decide on matching weekly or monthly \"pocket monies\". Having said that, for fairness, as a woman myself, I class hair dressers and nail appointments as a luxury item just as much as smoking. \n7. Each person should be left with just their agreed pocket money, plus their regular savings money, which can be moved automatically on payday into their savings account. \n8. All the rest should be paid into the Bills and Expenses Account, apart from any Children's Savings.\nIf one of you has trouble with money, perhaps the account should only be in one name. \n9. Each person should be responsible for purchasing birthday and Christmas gifts for their own relatives and their partner. Children's gifts should be a joint expense from the expense account.\n10. It's important to have a monthly go-over the finances with both parties to keep transparency and trust. Keeping to budgets is extremely important, especially when it comes to groceries or kid's expenses. So these monthly meetings are a good opportunity to revise figures or raise concerns about upcoming expenses.\n\nHopefully, you will find this helpful.\n\nObviously the husband is an ahole for stealing the card, and yes, I still class it as stealing as it is taking without consent. Even if you are married, I don't think it is acceptable to just take each other's cards as you feel like without asking first.

This doesn't mean the budget is inadequate, and it has everything to do with their relationship to money. Some people only run through money if there's someone else they think they can hit up for more. My ex was one of these - he actually made more than me in terms of salary, even after his student loan payments, and I put more into the joint account. And he constantly ran through all of his money, and also put things for himself on the joint account and overdrew it.

Everything else is also increasing in price. If he gets more money for cigarettes, that means less money for food (food inflation was recently 20% in the UK), energy bills (more than doubled in the last two years), housing costs (mortgage rates 5x in the last three years, rent also shooting up and very competitive), childcare (dramatic increases in the last year)... you see my point.", "That\u2019s not how a bank card works Tyreese, it belongs to the bank, on loan to the signer for their use only.

From other comments from OP, they don't have citizenship. I don't know exactly what the laws are like over there, but I do know that at least here in the US, that throws a wrench in a lot of things. It sucks, but I know a lot of people that have stayed in awful situations just because immigration is such a nightmare as it is that it's easier to just try and make do. \n\nBut I mean yeah, they do need to figure something out regardless.
