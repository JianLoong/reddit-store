Honestly it\u2019s been a pretty rough month for us. First myself my husband my daughter and my bil who lives with us also all got Covid. Few days later my mom and grandparents also got it. Then a couple weeks after we all got better I had to go to er only to learn I needed to have my gallbladder removed. It was difficult because I wasn\u2019t allowed to lift over 10lbs and my daughter is 12lbs. Thankfully my mom was there to help my husband and I she brought use dinner helped around the house and even took her for a few nights so I could rest and heal and my husband could take care of me. Due to the stress of surgery my milk supply dipped pretty bad and I had to supplement with formula after I ran out of my supply. I couldn\u2019t nurse her also due to pain meds they gave me. I wasn\u2019t thrilled to use formula cause I exclusively breastfeed but it had to be done. I\u2019m better now all healed up and thankful for the help my family gave us. However today I learned that they have still been giving her formula when they watch her even tho I provide them with pumped milk. They said formula is easier/quicker for them then warming the milk. I was upset and told them I was not happy about giving her formula in the first place but did so cause it was necessary but now it\u2019s not. I told them I\u2019m taking all formula from their houses and will give them pumped frozen milk. They are NOT to give her formula any more and if they do she will not be coming over anymore. I appreciate how much they helped us especially with baby but I feel they overstepped when I told them not to and they did anyway cause it was easier. I felt disrespected as a mom. I get some moms need to use formula as it\u2019s not an option for them and that totally okay, but I am able to nurse my daughter exclusively and choose to. I don\u2019t like the idea of her having formula when I know what I make is best for her needs specifically, but my husband feel I was a bit harsh.

Let's look at the steps involved for formula vs milk:\n\nPrepping a bottle of formula:\n\n1. measure out the amount of formula\n2. pour powder into botte\n3. add water and mix it in the bottle, making sure there are no air bubbles\n4. double check the temperature to make sure it is safe for baby\n5. If too hot, let it cool down\n6. If too cold warm it up\n\nPrepping a bottle of breast milk:\n\n1. Heat up a container of water, and place bottle in hot water bath\n2. Once bottle is warm enough, feed baby\n\nSeems that warming a bottle of breast milk is easier than formula.\n\nMakes you wonder if they're using the *microwave* to warm pre-mixed bottles of formula because that is \"faster.\"", "Id be worried they are wasting your milk.

Not by shaming you. Not by forcing you. It is YOUR choice and YOUR choice alone.\n\nYou can seek advice, you can ask for help, people can support you, but nobody can make that decision for you, no question that decision. Whatever the decision is.\n\n1 exception: medical professionals may tell you to not breastfeed because of medications, as you mentioned.\n\nAND that period is so stressful on new mothers, that they really, but really, don\u2019t need any new stressors: it is so detrimental for the mother and by extension, the baby. So the best anybody can do, is to do anything to bring down your stress: certainly not add to it.

It\u2019s absurd.", "Would it be more comparable to red meat vs poultry and fish?
