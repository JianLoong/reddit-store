We have organised a wedding in a beautiful winery with quite alot of friends coming to celebrate our big day with us. \n\nI've organized everything to make sure that the guest have the best time of their lives and dance till midnight. Now some people were discussing what they want to do after the wedding as it ends around 1am and they would like to party even more after that. I told my finace that i would like to come home after the wedding as i would be spending hours in a huge dress with makeup on and highly hairsprayed hair and ofcourse heels. He first agreed that we will infact come back home and unwind from a very busy day.\n\nToday he comes up with these crazy ideas of partying after the wedding and going out to clubs and stuff because some people would be doing that. When i told him that i would be too tired to do any of that, he basically told me to get lost as i was stopping him from sharing his happiness from the wedding even more and i am a buzzkill.\n\nI told him that i would like to spend the first night as newly weds just with him as we are already spoiling our friends with the best food and booze. And we can party with them the next day again. It basically ended up with me crying and him yelling.

You and he are not on the same page and doesnt sound like you share the same values.  \n\nThis is one night but if he cant value you and compromise on something thats important to you,  and.come up with a solution you both agree to on the first night of your marriage, what does the rest of your life look like?\n\n Every single day could be filled with things he is incapable of compromising on that set him off.\n\nHis reaction of screaming at you is not a normal response and he sounds like he has problems with anger and lacks the ability to discuss things rationally so i hope you think very seriously about this", "NTA but you\u2019d be a huge one to yourself if you marry this guy who from your comments sounds like he doesn\u2019t genuinely care about your feelings at all.", "NTA and why is he screaming at you over this?\n\nClearly it would be your wedding night and you are meant to spend that night as a couple, it is your first night of marriage!

There might be some middle ground you guys can find.", "NTA. Don\u2019t marry that guy. Seriously.

As a groomsman several times I was exhausted after these events and I know I definitely didn't do as much as the bride or groom. Definitely NTA.

You made me think about my entire relationship with juat those few words. Thank you. But i also just realised that i cry very easily and that would set anyone off.", "Hi there. So it is basically a reception kinda thing as we just sign the papers early during the day. We won't be getting married infront of the guest. Just a little party to celebrate with our loved ones on the same day.", "heck no, brides need to spend every second in that multiple thousands of dollars of wedding dress and not spend more money on yet another dress.", "Well when we talked, my understanding was that we come back home as he said the same thing that he told everyone that we're going home. But i could be wrong, which is sad for someone who have been together for 8 years.", "Sign me up sir. But the clubs basically don't close here. So you can go in at night and come out after 2 days and it'll be all good. \n\nAlso i suggested that we invite people home to chill or go out the next day but i know i will be dead looking after all the guests and stressing that everything goes well.", "By get lost, i mean he actually said the worda get lost. We actually decided earlier that we won't go out to anyone's place as a few people near our venue offered. We decided to come home and just unwind from all that stress of a wedding. \nOur friends decided to go out after we had this convo.

It doesnt matter if money will be wasted and you cant get deposits.  It doesnt matter that people may already have travel.plans.\n\nYou and the rest of your life matter.  \n\nIt doesnt matter if you've sunk 8 yrs into this.  Now you really know.  Better 8 yrs than sinking 18 yrs and 4 kids later and you finally that you cant live like that.\n\nIf he wanted to change and be a better man he's had 8 yrs to do it. There is extremely low probability that he will improve and change for the better after marriage.\n\nPlease know you deserve better.  Being alone is far superior than being with someone who treats you like you dont matter and like you are not valued.\n\nValue yourself and free yourself from this situation before you are more deeply entrenched and it is more difficult to extricate yourself.  It is just the 2 of you now, if you have a family together if will be even more difficult for you to leave, and you will accept more and more terrible treatment because you wont want to dissolve your marriage because of the kids.\nLeaving now will be 1000 times easier than afterwards.  It is always easier not to do something than to get out afterwards.\n\nI hope and pray that God shines the light on what you need to do  and that God gives you the strength and stamina to get through this.

In your post you said he told you \"to get lost\" and called you a buzzkill. I know some people talk with each other like that and to them it is not that deep. But i personally do not tolerate being talked to like that when fighting.", "Hmm, it definitely seems like he\u2019s trying to take action without considering what you want. But, is the only reason you want to spend time with him alone because \u201cyou\u2019re spoiling your friends with food and booze already\u201d?

It takes him a while to rwalise that i was right in some situations. But he needs his time and then does agree to what i tell him in the first place.", "I did have a heart to heart with him.

Not just a matter of not hearing you, but he\u2019s plainly telling you that he doesn\u2019t prioritize spending time with you.

I'm knees deep into this wedding shit to think straight.", "Do not let the wedding planning blind you to the fact that marrying this guy will be the biggest mistake of your life. Whatever time and money you have invested to date is a sunk cost. He sounds like a frat boy, not a responsible man.", "You say in another comment you proposed - how long did you wait for him to do so before you took the reins in that regard? Is that another another instance where he didn\u2019t care what you wanted?  He doesn\u2019t seem as invested in this as you.   He wants to spend your wedding night getting drunk with friends\u2026 that\u2019s a blaring red flag.", "Big Hugs. Darling I find your vibe wonderful but I am not loving the connotations of this story in tandem with the username you have chosen.  My heart goes out to you. May you know the joy of radical self-acceptance and surround yourself with thoughtful, caring people.", "So we have been together for almost 8 years and we have always talked about getting married. Proposing him was just to make him feel extra special as i guhs usually don't get that. His recent response was that he likes to share his happiness with everyone unlike me, hence he wants to spend the nights with our friends and celebrate.", "That\u2019s what the wedding reception is lol.   You celebrate with friends and family.  The wedding night is about THE COUPLE\u2026. Does he really want to get married to you or just have a big party? He does realize the most important part of that day is the vows and commitment right? Not the party??"]}
