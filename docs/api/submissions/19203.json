I told my finace that i would like to come home after the wedding as i would be spending hours in a huge dress with makeup on and highly hairsprayed hair and ofcourse heels. He first agreed that we will infact come back home and unwind from a very busy day.\n\nToday he comes up with these crazy ideas of partying after the wedding and going out to clubs and stuff because some people would be doing that. When i told him that i would be too tired to do any of that, he basically told me to get lost as i was stopping him from sharing his happiness from the wedding even more and i am a buzzkill.\n\nI told him that i would like to spend the first night as newly weds just with him as we are already spoiling our friends with the best food and booze.

It\u2019s not.", "No, crying shouldn\u2019t set anybody off, even if you do do it easily. If it sets him off to the point he\u2019s yelling at you, then you are incompatible. But is he yelling because you\u2019re crying, or are you crying because he\u2019s yelling at you (which seems an entirely predictable response to being yelled at)?", "I also cry very easily and it has never once \u201cset my partner off\u201d. He knows that I\u2019m just a person with big emotions and when I cry he comforts me. When I apologize for crying about everything he just tells me it\u2019s ok and he loves how intensely I care about things.

So nice to relax as just the two of us after a fun day of celebrating with friends and family!", "Thank you! I didn't even realize!", "We call those parents abusive assholes.  I have one of those.", "That\u2019s a big issue. No one should ever call someone names during an argument.", "I know people do it before marriage so it's not a big deal. But isn't wedding night still a big deal?"]}
