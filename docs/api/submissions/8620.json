His car insurance, phone, and plan are already paid for by me. I had three rules for him:\n\n1. Keep the house, front and back yards clean and mowed.\n2.

My initial reaction was to tell her to get her crap and get out of my house but not only had she been there long enough it would require an eviction process and I know she's spiteful enough to make it costly, but she isn't worth completely nuking my relationship with Alex over by tossing her out. I had a talk with Alex, his explanation for not telling me when she asked to stay was that he knew I'd probably say no and I let him know he was correct: she managed to get 2 years of free child support when both he and his brother were living with me full time, so she's gotten enough help from me. Since he broke the rules and my trust, I told him with two working adults in the house, there's nothing stopping them from paying all of their own utilities and they could pay the yearly property tax in lieu of rent (USD3600 vs lowest rent for a 2BR being 900/month). I told him I expect them to take over utilities in the following billing cycle and figure it out among themselves what bills were going in whose name.\n\nAlex has been calling and texting to get me to reconsider. He has gone to his grandparents as well, who have been on my case that I can't do that to Alex because it'd cut into time he could dedicate to studies and he's just trying to help his mother out which I should be doing instead since she's the mother of my kids.

He made his choices", "I would evict both of them then have him come to me an see what can be worked out in the father's relationship with his son. The son needs taught a lesson in don't bite the hand to hats helping him", " \n\nMaybe you should have thought about this and explained to him in more detail how to say no to people.", "He didn't just break a rule, he broke a huge rule with the worst person possible.\n\nHe's let this awful woman back into OP's life and given her power to spend months/years completely screwing him over.\n\nIt's going to be a nightmare to evict this woman and she'll likely trash the place on her way out.\n\nOP is being way too chill about this. He needs to explain very clearly to his son how badly he fucked up.", "[deleted]", "Absolutely get a rental agreement. Everything needs to be in writing.", "This exactly. It's time he learned how every single other landlord would treat him. NTA and if you give people an inch they will take a mile, soon as you deal with this the better. Do you really expect them to pay the bills? My guess is they will leave you with a bunch of arrears.", "I'd recommend against cutting off the utilities. It's illegal as a landlord, and despite the blood relation a court would see this as a (admittedly complicated/ familial) landlord/tenant issue", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

A good guy would acknowledge that he messed up and do the hard work necessary to make up for his bad behaviour. A good guy wouldn\u2019t go off and complain to granny and gramps, enlisting their help to force OP to roll over and bare his stomach. \n\nA good guy would recognise that having messed up, what he\u2019s facing now are the natural consequences.", "He's not a good guy. He's a sneak. He's a liar and a mooch. He betrayed his dad's trust and more or less bit the hand that fed him. You must be a very nice person to say this is a good guy.", "Amen to that. Evict all them mo-fos and rent that sh** out so I can retire early.", "OP  won\u2019t do this as he knows it will nuke his relationship with his son. At the end of the day he loves his son more than he hates his ex and that\u2019s how it should be.", "Yeah maybe charge $300 a month in rent instead. Or add the utilities onto that too.", "How would it be illegal if he told them they have to put the utilities in their own name instead of his and get his name take off the account. They aren't just gonna have electricity or water use if there is no name on an account. It's only illegal if he cuts them off and they are not in his name or if there eis a written lease. Either way the kid is a mooch and deserves to be on his ass if he can't follow his dad's rules to get a free housing", "You need to insist that your ex sign a lease ASAP. Since you're planning on moving in eventually, you need to plan on how to handle evicting her if she forces you to do so.\n\nIf you want to charge her $300/month, or $450/month, or whatever, go right ahead. But she can't stay there if she won't sign a lease.\n\nAnd it's up to your son if he wants to pay part of mom's rent. But she has to be named on a lease with clearly defined termination rights. And she ought to be paying market rate rent.", "What would you do if they refuse to pay the property tax?", "True that.", "A good guy can't love his mother and want to protect her and help any way he can? Like he can't be good if he does something he knows isn't on the up and up because he cares about someone? I don't disagree that he shouldn't have done it, and he/they should absolutely be stepping up. This is a natural consequence of being deceitful. I think it's throwing the baby out with the bathwater a bit to think he's not a good guy because he's young and he did something dumb for his mother on the basis of who knows what stories and conflicting emotions.", "sorry I didn't get the memo about how wanting to help your mom is bad. I agree, he did it sneakily & the dad needs to have a serious conversation about why it isn't okay to do that, but he's still young & deserves a chance to learn from this, not be punished for good intentions.", "Good point. No he shouldn't let it ruin the relationship he has with his son. I'll delete that.", "The son is 22, not 12. He's old enough to understand that his actions have consequences, and he was warned up-front that he wasn't allowed to let anyone else move in without permission.", "It's not bad. It's just the sneakiness and betrayal. Maybe he'll learn. I do hope it doesn't damage the relationship between he and his dad. At any rate I don't think Dad is the AH. Keep being nice. I noticed a lot of people on Reddit are bloodthirsty."]}
