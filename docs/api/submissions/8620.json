When my parents decided to move to a retirement village they passed their house on to me. The house is a 35-minute drive from where my son \"Alex\" (22M) is currently attending school. To help him out so he could just focus on school, I told him he could live there while he's in school and just work part-time. I pay for the utilities, maintenance, property tax, etc,. His car insurance, phone, and plan are already paid for by me. I had three rules for him:\n\n1. Keep the house, front and back yards clean and mowed.\n2. Don't move anyone in without talking to me about it first.\n3. He's responsible for his own groceries, gas, and fun money.\n\nRecently I was in town and swung by the house to visit and when Alex opened the door he had that deer-in-the-headlights look. None other than my ex-wife visible down the hall in I assume pajamas. Long story short, she's been living with him for the last four months. She had to switch jobs and took a big paycut. I knew he had been working on his relationship with her the last few years but I didn't realize that much. My initial reaction was to tell her to get her crap and get out of my house but not only had she been there long enough it would require an eviction process and I know she's spiteful enough to make it costly, but she isn't worth completely nuking my relationship with Alex over by tossing her out. I had a talk with Alex, his explanation for not telling me when she asked to stay was that he knew I'd probably say no and I let him know he was correct: she managed to get 2 years of free child support when both he and his brother were living with me full time, so she's gotten enough help from me. Since he broke the rules and my trust, I told him with two working adults in the house, there's nothing stopping them from paying all of their own utilities and they could pay the yearly property tax in lieu of rent (USD3600 vs lowest rent for a 2BR being 900/month). I told him I expect them to take over utilities in the following billing cycle and figure it out among themselves what bills were going in whose name.\n\nAlex has been calling and texting to get me to reconsider. He has gone to his grandparents as well, who have been on my case that I can't do that to Alex because it'd cut into time he could dedicate to studies and he's just trying to help his mother out which I should be doing instead since she's the mother of my kids.

I'd go as far as saying you're being way too generous. He should be paying fair market rent at that point.

That\u2019s beyond generous. If people are on your case about your expectations and requests then ask if they will pay for their rent then.
