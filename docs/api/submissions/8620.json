When my parents decided to move to a retirement village they passed their house on to me. The house is a 35-minute drive from where my son \"Alex\" (22M) is currently attending school. To help him out so he could just focus on school, I told him he could live there while he's in school and just work part-time. I pay for the utilities, maintenance, property tax, etc,. His car insurance, phone, and plan are already paid for by me. I had three rules for him:\n\n1. Keep the house, front and back yards clean and mowed.\n2. Don't move anyone in without talking to me about it first.\n3. He's responsible for his own groceries, gas, and fun money.\n\nRecently I was in town and swung by the house to visit and when Alex opened the door he had that deer-in-the-headlights look. None other than my ex-wife visible down the hall in I assume pajamas. Long story short, she's been living with him for the last four months. She had to switch jobs and took a big paycut. I knew he had been working on his relationship with her the last few years but I didn't realize that much. My initial reaction was to tell her to get her crap and get out of my house but not only had she been there long enough it would require an eviction process and I know she's spiteful enough to make it costly, but she isn't worth completely nuking my relationship with Alex over by tossing her out. I had a talk with Alex, his explanation for not telling me when she asked to stay was that he knew I'd probably say no and I let him know he was correct: she managed to get 2 years of free child support when both he and his brother were living with me full time, so she's gotten enough help from me. Since he broke the rules and my trust, I told him with two working adults in the house, there's nothing stopping them from paying all of their own utilities and they could pay the yearly property tax in lieu of rent (USD3600 vs lowest rent for a 2BR being 900/month). I told him I expect them to take over utilities in the following billing cycle and figure it out among themselves what bills were going in whose name.\n\nAlex has been calling and texting to get me to reconsider. He has gone to his grandparents as well, who have been on my case that I can't do that to Alex because it'd cut into time he could dedicate to studies and he's just trying to help his mother out which I should be doing instead since she's the mother of my kids.

If you already know it's going to be a long, costly eviction process, get a lawyer already! Start now while she's not on any official paperwork! Don't let her get her tentacles further into the place by paying rent or getting utilities in her name!\n\nAnd you say you don't want to nuke your relationship with your son, but what IS this relationship? One where you are obliged to provide but you don't need to be respected? One where you give and he does whatever the fuck he wants? One where he takes from you and gives to his mother and doesn't care how much that hurts you and upsets you? That is not a relationship that needs to be saved in its current form. It needs a hard reset. \n\nIf the grandparents think Alex needs time for his studies and his mother need to be helped out, they should open their wallets and make it happen.\n\nTo be honest, it sounds like when people in your life are difficult, you just give in and let them do whatever they want to you. If that's what you really want for your life and your relationships, to be walked over and used, then go ahead. But really think about all of this first.", "INFO: are the grandparents your or her parents? And can't they take her in if they are here's?", "He broke the 2nd rule. If I were on your shoe, I would immediately start the eviction. If this happened in my country, I'll have the mom moved out right there and then. As for your son, idk make him realize that he broke your trust. Maybe teach him a lesson? NTA.", "NTA. Your son is being a manipulative AH old and he chose to lie to you willingly. You\u2019re right to demand that he and your conniving ex should be paying all the house bills. Get a rental agreement in place with your son and kick the ex out.", "NTA - mate charge them rent, market rate. Start the eviction process, use the rent money to offset the costs.", "Wow, you laid out the red carpet for your son and he stabbed you in the back. You are NTA my friend. Your wife is an AH and your son seems to be following in her footsteps as he's a total AH. Get a lawyer to exist your ex.", "NTA", "NTA - Also make sure to protect yourself legally, if they pay the tax then they have a leg to stand on to claim ownership later down the line. Make them pay utilities AND draft up a rent agreement for the same amount of the tax and then when you get that money you use it to pay the tax in your name. That way they are just renters and have no leg to stand on in terms of ownership of the house.\n\nThough personally, I would have evicted the wife and charged your son market rate rent for breaking one of the 3 very simple rules you laid down.", "> I should be doing instead since she's the mother of my kids.\n\nI hate this saying. She is a grown women. She can take care of herself. Why should someone be entitled to your help just because you had kids with them?\n\nThis is not the same as paying child support, or working with an ex to ensure a minor child is getting the care needed, even if you and your ex don't get along, just to be clear.\n\nIn this case, the kid is an adult, and not helping the ex does not affect the kid. If OP's parents want to help her so bad, they can do it, but don't try to manipulate OP in to doing anything for an ex.\n\nLook, you laid out vary clear rules for you son to follow while living in your house. He admitted to choosing to break them and lie to you about cause he wanted to do something he knew you would not allow. \n\nAs a result of that, he lost the privileges you had given him, and not must deal with that. \n\nIt is a clear case of don't bite the hand that feeds you.", "NTA yes your son fucked around and should find out BUT she maybe a manipulative moocher she is still his mom and who is leaving their mom homeless he is between a rock and a hard place", "Nta. Tell him they pay up, or your next offer is a legal contract for market level rent plus utilities. Or he can ask her to move out and remain living there free on his own. Subletting without permission is illegal and landlords do evict for that reason. Your son hasn't reacted in a mature way, I'd point out he wouldn't have done that to a non related landlord.", "Evict her. Do it now because it's going to drag on forever. Your relationship with your son is already out the window. Oh you want to live there after your son graduates and you think a woman that stole 60K from you is just going to move out on her own? Do it while you have a job. \n\n>she managed to get 2 years of free child support when both he and his brother were living with me full time, so she's gotten enough help from me.\n\nAnd he still moved her in. \n\n>which I should be doing instead since she's the mother of my kids.\n\nHe is 22. How long do you owe her? For a kid who has no issue with lying and scamming you. NTA.", "Sell the house. Let the new owner deal with them.", ">First of all you should've mentioned you don't live in the house, it would make much less confusing. \n\nThink you were the only one confused about it.", "They are legit complaining about $70 a week (if she looks at the property taxes weekly) and utilities, which they generate anyway.\n\nOP ask your son if he and his mother would rather pay market rent or $70 a week (and either way get a rental agreement written up, and give hers an end date). Heeeck, the monthly amount they'd need to put aside for property taxes is basically a weeks rent if they had to pay market rates.", "A good guy might if he is literally helping his mom", "A good guy that isn't being manipulated*", "I don't think he is ruining his relationship with his son, but is teaching him a lesson he needs to learn. That when you break the rules, especially willing like he did, there are consequences to those actions. \n\nIf OP allows his son to not only break the rules that were laid out for him, but to also have don't it by lying and going behind OP's back, what kind of message does that send? If Alex gets away with doing that to his dad, who else will he lie to? What other rules will he break, thinking that there will be no consequences?", "Helping his mom by hurting his dad? \n\nnot really the good guy move.", "> sorry I didn't get the memo about how wanting to help your mom is bad\n\nIt\u2019s bad because he\u2019s not the one helping her. \n\nHe tricked his dad into doing it, even though his dad does not want to help her, and she scammed him into paying her two years of child support that she should have been paying him. \n\nIf he wants to help her, he can start paying for her himself instead of getting his dad to do it for him.", "Did the son volunteer the truth, or did he lie? \n\n\n\nLying is literally all that it takes to be a liar, even if you grow out of it later."]}
