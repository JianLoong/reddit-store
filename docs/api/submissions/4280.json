Both of my stepsisters stepkids ran as soon as they could and cut off all contact with the family. I remember when we were younger, they hated that their dad remarried and were never interested in being big siblings to my nephew and nieces. My nephew has the most memories of them and doesn't care to ever try and have a relationship with them but my nieces have longed for their older siblings for years and my sister and her husband have lied to them about the reason their siblings are not around, have lied and claimed they left messages for their little sisters so they'd know they loved them and told them once they were old enough they could look for them. Apparently both being at least 14 was old enough in their eyes so they let them start trying to reach out. The girls even paid someone on the internet to track down their info (FB profiles, email address and even home address). The girls attempted to reach out to both half siblings and were ignored and then blocked. They attempted to email them and also got no reply.\n\nI told my sister and her husband they needed to reign them in before the girls try and show up at their front doors and get them slammed in their faces or told to fuck off. They told me it wouldn't get that bad. That nobody can shut kids out like that.

They said they wanted to see them now. They also shared some of the lies their parents made up about what these siblings said (they will always have a home with them, they were their precious little sisters and were always wanted and had been prayed for, that they believed their mom sent them from heaven for the two of them). Now I know those two never said those things. I remember hearing the stuff they said about my nephew and nieces, about my sister, about their dad for remarrying. There was never any love there.\n\nI told the girls I really hoped they would take what I said into consideration. They asked me why, when they knew they were waiting.
