My nephew has the most memories of them and doesn't care to ever try and have a relationship with them but my nieces have longed for their older siblings for years and my sister and her husband have lied to them about the reason their siblings are not around, have lied and claimed they left messages for their little sisters so they'd know they loved them and told them once they were old enough they could look for them. Apparently both being at least 14 was old enough in their eyes so they let them start trying to reach out.

The girls attempted to reach out to both half siblings and were ignored and then blocked. They attempted to email them and also got no reply.\n\nI told my sister and her husband they needed to reign them in before the girls try and show up at their front doors and get them slammed in their faces or told to fuck off. They told me it wouldn't get that bad. That nobody can shut kids out like that.

I suggested they needed to adjust their expectations since their older siblings had ignored and blocked them. I told them they might want to give it some more time. They said they wanted to see them now. They also shared some of the lies their parents made up about what these siblings said (they will always have a home with them, they were their precious little sisters and were always wanted and had been prayed for, that they believed their mom sent them from heaven for the two of them). Now I know those two never said those things. I remember hearing the stuff they said about my nephew and nieces, about my sister, about their dad for remarrying. There was never any love there.\n\nI told the girls I really hoped they would take what I said into consideration. They asked me why, when they knew they were waiting.

Someone says \"A loves you.\" Then why doesn't A talk to me if she loves me so much? The girls are just now realizing this sad and hard truth", "NTA your sister and her husband are setting those girls up for a terrible fall when they do make face to face contact (I doubt you've fully dissuaded them from meeting, teenagers can be stubborn as hell).  They failed as parents, they spent so much time telling their kids stories rather than try to soften a hard truth that those girls will be more hurt than they ever would be if they knew the truth from the beginning, with the added horror that they might not be able to trust their parents ever again", "NTA\n\nKids can be feral. If you've built them up with lies, given them some hopeful Disney fantasy, and just piled it on? Lawd almighty, that's a nuclear bomb ready to go off. Any event out of it will send little pieces of shrapnel throughout the rest of their lives. They will have issues and never trust their parents again.\n\nYou don't treat children like that? Are you kidding me?!\n\nThey hired someone to track the older kids down. They're forcing contact and using a guilt trip with horrible consequences if the older kids don't comply. Magic 8 ball says, that's a great beginning to harassment!\n\nDo the parents not understand the potential consequences of what they're doing? Or are they so full of themselves that they're thrice diabetic on their own BS?\n\nIt's more than just the kids.\n\nIf I learned my neglectful parent halfway stalked me to find out where I was, was trying to guilt trip with children, and possibly forcing contact multiple times- that's something you  kill at the source because you're probably dealing with crazy. Parents doing all of this is crazy.\n\nUgh, my mother, for all her faults, is very good at her job. She works in a multipractice firm as a paralegal, but she runs the place. She's the one who types the documents that a lawyer uses. All of the information goes through her.\n\nShe's dealt with forced family contact and it's never good. \n\nThe harassment in this case is easily provable if they paid someone to track down the older kids and if someone is recording the instances when it happens. The language sounds like it would be obvious.\n\nThis could effect the 14 year olds in more then emotional trauma. If one of the parents gets arrested, types employment can go bye bye just for having it on the record. If a restraining order is pursued, the 14 year olds are in the crossfire. \n\nI may sound like I'm overreacting, but these kinds of things have a blast radius and can go sour very quickly because of the mental and emotional distress. It only takes one accident or one idiot and everything can go permanently wrong.", "NTA. What you said is BEYOND reasonable. They are being bad parents.", "NTA and I'd like to point out they're being set up for worse then heartache.  \"You'll always have a home here\" for many is seen as an invitation to simply walk in.  Should these children take it this way the result could be A lot worse then just heartbreak from a slammed door.  Considering the actions so far them showing up and knocking the Best case scenario is a slammed door and them leaving.  Setting a child up for the best case scenario being heartbreak makes your sister and BIL not just assholes but pretty terrible parents to boot.", "I can\u2019t even imagine what I would do if I was in pain from losing my mother, in pain from watching my father remarry and replace me with new kids  even though I begged him not to, and then one of the kids stalked me and told me that my dead mother sent her and her sister down from heaven to be with me. I know what I would want to do, but I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m a good enough person not to physically throttle a child.\n\nIf your niece and nephew meet their half siblings under the conditions you described, they would be seriously emotionally damaged. Especially from the expense and effort of making the trip so far away. So you did the right thing, even though I really think they deserve to know the whole truth. So even if they\u2019re stupid enough to do it, at least they\u2019re warned.  Your sister is delusional enough to fantasize about the perfect blended family even though her step kids literally fled to escape from her, so of course she\u2019s going to think that her kids stalking and dropping by unannounced to the step kids will go well. Someone needs to look out for her kids because she sure isn\u2019t.", "NTA. Somebody had to tell them the truth. Your parents are beyond all hope of being rational about this.", "NTA. Somebody had to tell them the truth. Your parents are beyond all hope of being rational about this.", "No. I think the parents told the 2 younger girls that the older half siblings prayed for younger siblings and wanted them so much when that is not the case at all. Now these 2 young girls are on a mission to find these long lost siblings who love them so much.\n\nThis is going to come back to bite the parents. They've lied to these girls all along and now it seems they are allowing them to stalk the half siblings.", "Right but who is it who's in heaven sending people?  It reads like op's sister and her husband told the younger kids that the older kids think their (late?!) mother sent the younger siblings to them.  This whole thing is very disturbing but if those estranged daughters mom is deceased and sister and husband have been spinning a yarn that includes her? Super gross times a million."]}
