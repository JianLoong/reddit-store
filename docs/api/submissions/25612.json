Be an adult and roll with it.\n\nAnd pay attention to pronouns when someone uses them.", "NTA lets be honest here most coworkers who are gonna be upset at you for not making it clear that your spouse is a woman are likely the same people that would get upset with you for \u201cthrowing your sexuality in their face\u201d if you did", "Depends on how angry John is/was. Calling you a jerk, because you put me in an awkward situation, that could have been avoided with a few hints? Yeah, totally normal. Beeing really angry and peeved for weeks? Not Okay.\n\nSo I hope NAH.", "NTA - do they feel they have to tell you the gender of their significant other? Sorry John but you have no right to say anything. As for Alex, she was a little annoyed, and I think that\u2019s fine but that still doesn\u2019t make you an asshole. It\u2019s just a big misunderstanding and an awkward situation, and everyone should just move on.", "Omg NTA this really is funny, especially with the kid's response.\n\nCoworker needs to touch grass. Your partner may have felt unsafe if he was freaking out (need more info there).", "NTA\n\nYou do not owe anyone information about your private life. Also their fault for not picking up on it.\nI do not understand why Alex is/was mad, seems like an extreme over reaction.", "Nta It\u2019s not your fault the world is so heteronormative", "NTA \nI don't see why your colleague should lose his temper because your partner is a woman.\nI understand that your wife may have felt uncomfortable with his reaction because she expected you to tell him, but it's not a fault to don't talk about it, especially regarding the rate of violence against people in the LGBTQ+ community.\nIn a perfect world your co-worker would not have reacted differently if it were a man, a woman or a non-binary person", "NTA, wtf you don't have to disclose your sexuality to your co-workers, if they got a problem with it, it's their problem. A homosexual couple shouldn't be an event and something that HAS to be shared with everyone, it's none of their concern.", "NTA queer people do not have to disclose themselves to coworkers. Queer people don\u2019t have to disclose themselves to anyone. \n\nMan made assumptions, man got mad because assumption was wrong and he was embarrassed in front of child. Man angry because man can\u2019t fathom that woman don\u2019t need man to open jars. Man has no emotional intelligence or regulation.", "NTA. It is not your fault your coworkers made heteronormative assumptions. It\u2019s unfortunate your wife was in an uncomfortable situation but that doesn\u2019t make you an ass.", "What? They\u2019re literally calling you a jerk for not coming out to them at work?", "INFO:\n\nWhat are the specifics of John losing his cool?\n\nYou could be the asshole if your partner was accosted by your coworker and you decided to laugh instead of being there for your partner.", "NTA.  Who cares if he was uncomfortable.  It\u2019s not your job to clear your personal life with co-workers.    Let\u2019s say it out loud for those in the back.  \u201cCo-workers are people you work with, not your friends nor entitled to be kept up-to-date on people\u2019s PRIVATE life.\u201d  There is a boundary between personal/professional and you are 100% entitled to keep it that way.  Just because someone else wants to know isn\u2019t the reason to share it.", "NTA for not telling them. Slightly TA for laughing. \nJohn is TA for getting mad, being early & telling other co workers.", "NTA. If I were dating a man named sam for instance I wouldn\u2019t say to people my partner sam is a man. I don\u2019t think you had to be that explanatory. It\u2019s no one else\u2019s business", "I was a latch key kid innthe 90s but I cringe at u letting ur 7yo answer the door.\n\nOther than that nta", "NTA I\u2019m not an over sharer at work and frankly don\u2019t like to get involved in others lives at work either. I would think that at sometime you used she about your wife. Not your fault no one picked up on it.", "NTA. You didn't hide your marriage to Alex from anyone. They just assumed she was a man because Alex is a name used by both genders. \n\nYou can't help people making that assumption and you're not obligated to inform all your coworkers of your personal living arrangements. Alex's gender is none of your coworker's business. Truthfully, the majority of them don't care. They're wrapped up in their own personal lives and don't have time to worry about what their coworkers do in their free time.\n\nI think what happened was funny and the coworker who showed up at your door probably told it as a funny story at work, and it gave people something to talk about for awhile. I doubt if anyone thought it was a big deal, besides being an entertaining story that teaches the folly of making assumptions about people.", "NTA. This is a complete non-issue and its not clear to me whether John had some sort of inappropriate over-reaction. But thats not on you.", "Ive gotten into the habit of asking for the grownups in the house. As a teacher, I have had many students who live with grandparents, aunts/uncles, foster/adoptive parents, friends, etc. it\u2019s easier to just say the adult/grow up in charge.", "Honestly this is just further proof why you don't spell it out for people. If they want to assume your in a hetero relationship, just let them, because some people can't handle homosexual relationships", "My best friend was first just a colleague and when someone talked about partners he always referred to his SO as a woman, but only because everyone just assumed it's a woman and he just went along with it. When we got closer i found out about his BF. He thought I would be mad, but i wasn't, i was just confused at first as everyone at work always said GF. Why should i be mad? Working in a male dominated industry with a lot of sexist, homophobic and xenophobic guys, i totally understood (and still do as he hasn't revealed that fact to this day) why he never openly corrected them. He wasn't scared of stupid comments, mistreatment or anything, he just didn't want to deal with that at work and it is nobody's business anyway, so he never told anyone but me.\n\nTherefore i totally get why OP never said anything about being married to a woman, even if maybe just subconsciously. It's nobody's business and if those people are actually mad at her for that, it's probably not just out of embarrassment, but probably homophobia and maybe even thinking, if she were heterosexual, they might've had a chance with her one day. Why else would they be that mad?\n\nTotally NTA", "Well NTA to coworkers, but it sounds like it\u2019s Alex that is upset and also a I can\u2019t tell if OP \u201chid\u201d Alex\u2019s gender a little? The \u201conly woman\u201d and likes to keep personal stuff separate precursor comments confused me. OP isn\u2019t responsible for heteronormative assumptions and owes the coworkers nothing on this, but if Alex felt OP tried to hide her she\u2019s not the AH and if OP did try to hide and Alex is not okay with that, I see Alex\u2019s point if that\u2019s not how she wanted to live. It seems like that\u2019s not the case because OP doesn\u2019t care that the coworker knows now? \n\nBut OP does need to address kindly with Alex, because from the start of her explanation, it seemed almost like she was saying it was intentional to hide? And maybe Alex got that impression if it was communicated badly. No one should make someone be \u201cout\u201d But I do think one\u2019s partner gets to decide if they want to be in an out or not relationship too, to a degree, so I can see Alex\u2019s issue if that was the impression.", "Yeah, I talked at school about my girlfriend and people still managed to ask me things about my boyfriend. Ehm, I wouldn't call my boyfriend my girlfriend, not do men usually use she/her lol", "The reverse always happens to my uncle. He refers to his wife as \"My partner Alex.\" Then people are surprised to see a woman appear at events. They were together for a decade before getting married, it was just easier to say partner.", "I wouldn\u2019t say we know enough to label him a homophobe. I think he likely just made an assumption and then felt stupid because he\u2019d asked for her dad. He shouldn\u2019t have blamed OP though.", "I would say kid don't answer the door alone u can't trust strangers.", "And I did refer to Alex as She it's just that no one cared or they just assumed because neither I nor Alex 'look like we could be into women'", "I was thinking parents but I like your way much better because it includes those who are in other living situations.", "I'm face painter. I always say grown-ups or adults. The kids will tell me who they're there with. But yeah, so many kids don't live with their parents.", "We live in a heteronormative world, so it\u2019s understandable if John was surprised. But to lose his cool? That does not reflect well on him.", "This is why I use partner/spouse in conversations with acquaintances in reference to my very gay husband. I don't care for the anxiety that comes with the awkwardness when they're very obviously uncomfortable.", "Yeah, as a gay man I hate how every straight person I\u2019ve ever worked with felt the need to shove their \u201csexual preference\u201d in my face by wearing a wedding ring, putting pictures of their family on their desks and talking about their opposite sex spouses.  They should keep that shit to themselves.  /s", "Do you always think people who mention their spouses are telling you about their sexual preferences, or only when they\u2019re not straight?", "So if your female colleague said \"my wife, Alex\" you'd consider that them telling you their sexual preferences and need to come up with a reaction?", "I'm not white so people just assume I'm getting the pronouns mixed up and subscribe to the default heteronormative ideas. The irony being I speak English very fluently like it's my first language and they know this, but it's the pronouns that must confuse me still.", "I'm guessingb they weren't listening.", "I hope nobody actually said that to you", "I got embarrassed in a similar way. Coworker was saying she probably wouldn't have kids because of partners problem. Everyone laughs so I ask \"problem?\".  Yup, wrong equipment.", "I also don't think saying she's married to a woman doesn't say anything about sexual anything, unless you also think or sex anytime you see someone wearing a wedding ring.", "the way you say that make them sound like pok\u00e9mon \ud83d\udc80", "Now he's afraid he'll well be catching gay too \ud83d\ude31", "I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a whole NSFW sub for people who think that. I\u2019m not gonna go looking for it, but I bet it\u2019s there.", "Lesbian used same-sex spouse, it was very effective!", "I wish you could catch lesbians that easily! I need a girlfriend.", "Us straights actually have an app like Pokemon for LGBTQIA people. He must have been mad because he already had Married Lesbian Coworker Raising Twins."]}
