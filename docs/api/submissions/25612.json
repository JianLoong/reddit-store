I just prefer it this way. Also, I am the only woman among my colleagues in my area and it is already hard as it is without being too close to anyone. \n\nRegardless, I've talked about kids or Alex a few times with others and I'm used to referring to her by her name when she's not around. So I'd be like Alex this Alex that and it only happened a few times.\n\nNow I left something at work on Friday and I had a full weekend to myself that week. My coworker John (40M) offered to drop it off at my house since it was already on his way. I thanked him. He said he would drop it off around 7pm.  I took a shower around 5 pm.\n\nAs Alex told me John came to our house while I was at the shower. He got shocked by the fact that Alex was in fact a woman and lost his cool for the moment. When I got out of the shower Alex was extremely mad at me for not telling my coworkers about her and creating this awkward situation.\n\nI may be TA here because my reaction was to laugh since it was an extremely funny situation. I told her I refer to her by her name when she's not around and they just didn't pick up via the pronouns or something. And the whole situation was funny. Alex called me a jerk and said I needed to grow tf up. We made up. I still laugh when I think of it.\n\nAt work, also everyone was asking me why I didn't make it clear to them. John called me a jerk because he said initially my daughter answered the door phone and he told her to get her mom or dad and she was like I only have two moms sir. \n\nId really like to know if I was the AH here?

I could totally see myself making a heteronormative assumption about Alex. If I then met her and realised you had a wife, I would go, 'Oh, Alex is a woman!' and then get on with my life. It's not only perfectly okay, it's not my business. It in no way is anything to do with me.\n\nEqually, if I asked someone to speak to their dad and was told they only had two moms, I would apologise for the assumption, not get weirded out...", "NTA, though I can understand Alex being a bit upset; she may have felt invalidated or like you were ashamed, and that that\u2019s why you hadn\u2019t told your coworkers about her. It\u2019s still your choice what you share at work, though.\n\nJohn sure sounds like an AH! He\u2019s the one who stopped by 2 hours early and it sounds like he made the assumption that Alex was male\u2026 in addition to that, why is it any of his business anyway? It all sounds like a weird chain reaction of events that lead to this situation, but honestly I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH at all. \n\nNot every workplace feels safe enough for folks to share details about their lives. It\u2019s crap that this is still the case in 2023.\n\nI hope you and Alex are OK.", "NTA- It\u2019s not your fault your colleagues didn\u2019t pick up on pronouns. You weren\u2019t actively trying to hide it. Alex has a right to be annoying by being put in an awkward situation, but John\u2019s reaction was strange.", "NTA. You\u2019re kinda an AH though for laughing in front of your wife at that moment, because she\u2019s upset and depending on how John reacted , she might\u2019ve seen it as you pretty much invalidating her feelings. Glad you guys made up though. \n\nWe live in a heteronormative world, so it\u2019s understandable if John was surprised. But to lose his cool? That does not reflect well on him.", "HYSTERICALLY FUNNY.  Co worker made an ASS out of himself in front of wife AND child.  That is HIS issue no...?   I loved your reaction, and would have loved to have seen that asshole co worker's FACE the very first time you met back up/////", "NTA. If this had happened to me, I'd have been surprised and maybe said \"Oh I had no idea. Well, here's the stuff you needed, carry on, see you Monday.\" It's really not a big deal and there's no reason to make it weird afterward, though agreed it does make a funny story afterwards.", "It's unreasonable for anyone to demand that you be out regardless of where you work. John was an AH to make anything of it. You don't owe him or any of your colleagues heteronormativity and it's their fault if they assumed that. You do need to talk to your wife though. This was an unpleasant interaction dealing with John's unexpected homophobia and you owe her more than just laughing at the ridiculousness of it. Soft-YTA for laughing rather than responding to what your wife was actually saying.", "NTA\n\nit's none of your co workers business, although laughing at Alex was a bit off when she was annoyed at you.", "NTA - Alex is a gender neutral name, and everyone made the assumption here. That they didn\u2019t ask for clarification isn\u2019t your problem.\n\nTalk to your wife, and ask for her POV of the situation. She is the one only one who can tell you what she is feeling and why.", "Pretty funny. My wife and I have names that are used for either gender so I'm always careful to point out which is which when introducing us.\n\nNow, what's hella funny is my aunt and uncle had some friends (wife and husband) called Gaylene and Leslie when we were kids. My aunt and uncle aren't up with the lingo at the best of times and couldn't understand why we pissed ourselves laughing when they said their friends were coming over later. That's right folks, they shortened their names to Gay and Les. Honestly", "Married lesbian here, NTA. This is hilarious. Your coworker is TA for insulting you though. I refer to my wife as \"my wife\" pretty much all the time, I just stopped caring about outing myself as a lesbian a long time ago. Most people dont blink an eye, lol. Refering as First Name is conpletely fine also. Your coworker needs to get a grip, you dont owe anyone an outing.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour coworker being a homophobe is not your fault.", "NTA. It's none of their business", "NTA. You have a right to keep your private life seperate from work. But perhaps your co-workers are angry because they thought u were purposefully misleading them.", "Its 2023. LGBTQIA+ people can be married and have kids and it just should not a big deal.

It's not that easy to only ever refer to someone by their name, never \"my wife\" or by a gender neutral pronoun (unless that is how she is always referred by) for the entire time you have been at work.
