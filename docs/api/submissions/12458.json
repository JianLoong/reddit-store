I have been living with these conditions for the past 10 years but the last year has been really hard. \n\nSo last night we went to an event as a family (my husband, two teenagers and I).   It was stormy out (high winds, snow, icy sidewalks).  We had to park maybe 400m away from the venue.  When we walked to the venue it was daylight and the sidewalks were passable.  My husband and kids walked ahead of me.  I was a bit annoyed but I let it go, not wanting to ruin the evening. \n\nAfter the event we left.  I turned away from my family for maybe 20 seconds to say good bye to someone who sat with us at the event.  When I turned around my family was halfway to the car.   I was really annoyed.  \n\nI trudged through the dark, snowy weather.  I literally could barely make it to the car because the wind was so strong and the sidewalk was quite icy at this point.  I finally made it to the parking lot and my husband pulled the car out of the parking spot and picked me up probably 10 feet from where we were parked.  \n\nI got in the car and said \u2018thanks a lot for waiting for me, fucking asshole\u2019.  My husband acted surprised and said he planned to bring the car around to pick me up.  Hearing is not one of my disabilities and my family never told me this was the plan.  \n\nWe had told the kids we\u2019d go to their favourite restaurant afterwards and we drove there in awkward silence.  When we got there my husband acted all sulky, didn\u2019t order food and was staring at his phone.   I looked at him and told him he at least owed me an apology.  He said \u2018I\u2019m sorry. It was a misunderstanding\u2019.  My daughter (19f) said I was ruining the night.  \n\nI let it go but I\u2019m still upset by the situation. \n\nSo here I am, prepared for an honest judgment.

Your family needs to understand that this is how things are now and that honestly it\u2019s so much worse for you then it could ever be inconvenient for them to walk slower. I recommend talking to them about it and letting them know how painful and difficult it can be for you and also how excluded you may feel when they just go off without you.

I shouldn\u2019t have lashed out at him like that, especially in front of the kids.", "We did speak.  I apologized and so did he.   I explained to him that my outburst was related to how I felt in the moment (abandoned, not cared for) and that I should have called him to see if he was picking me up.", "How it was his fault when she stopped and started to talk to someone without communicating to him that he need to wait?", "I honestly don\u2019t know why it didn\u2019t occur to me to call him.", "Mainly because to him he *didn't* abandon his wife? He went to go to the car to come pick her up. Admittedly, she didn't hear it, but once she got into the car, all she had to do was express her annoyance like an adult, and not curse at her husband in front of the kids.\n\nAnd then, after finding out it was a misunderstanding, she wants an apology, like her intentionally hurt her? This isnt a pattern of behavior, it was a mistake. Gosh its like you *want* the husband to be the bad guy.", "Because she didn't catch him saying that he was planning on picking her up in the car. Even if he didn't say it her initial thoughts went right to 'he was going to abandon me in this lot' which is unhealthy as it is.\n\nRegardless, miscommunication or not, it doesn't justify blatantly swearing in front of the kids and having such a negative attitude.\n\nYou're welcome to have your own take but mine stands.", "He was going to get the car to pick her up? The were walking to a nearby parked car, she was hardly \"abandoned\". She's the one that wandered away from the group to go chat with her friend.", "Husband went with the kids to get the car while she was talking to someone. All the while within 400 meters tops, hardly abandoned. Even the daughter pointed out OP was being ridiculous.", "She could have discussed about like an adult instead of insulting him in front of the kids like a child.\n\nShe's acting entitled and using her disabilities as excuses for feeling left behind. If she'd been harboring resentment about that she can maturely ask her family to pace with her in these situations. \n\nI have my physical disabilities and a slow walker. I never expect people to wait for me and damned if I snap at people for expecting the pity of it.", "But he had nothing to apologize for? OP could have used her big girl words and asked him to wait or come around to pick her up, instead she started hurling insults at him for...walking back to their car? She's the one who decided that chatting with her friend was more important than walking with her family.", "I know you are upset with the world because your body failed on you.

It's critical at this age to be mindful of that. You are failing them in this respect. YTA.", "Why does it matter that they\u2019re older? Ever think that seeing mom telling dad that he\u2019s a \u201cfucking ass hole\u201d might make them uncomfortable?

Like you said, he is well aware of your condition so maybe he didn\u2019t think it was necessary to interrupt you for something that would be obvious to most other people.", "He knows you need help, so he doesn't need to communicate that he was going to get the car because he already knew you needed it, but no you needed them to have a pity party for you", "I\u2019m a 41 year old woman, and I would be horrified if one of my parents spoke that way to the other. Your children\u2019s ages do not matter.\n\nEditing to add that you owe an apology to your children as well.", "And you couldn\u2019t have mentioned that you wanted them to wait up for you before talking to strangers? Seems like on both occasions you\u2019re just as bad as not communicating but for some reasons its up to everyone else to read your mind. You couldn\u2019t give him the benefit of the doubt that he was going out of his way to make your life easier and instead immediately throw a temper tantrum and verbally attack him as soon as you get to the car.

He was even going to come back and pick you up. \n\nYou started swearing and hurling insults like a bratty child. \n\nYTA, you owe the apology. He does not.", "Lack of respecting your limitations or lack of making everything totally about your limitations? First you were irritated that they walked ahead of you. (And as someone married to a wife with some mobility issues, let me make it plain\u2026it isn\u2019t as easy as you might think to slow my walk down to an absolute crawl in order to walk side by side with her). Next, you\u2019re pissed that they were ALL walking while you were talking. If you are the one with issues, you need to be the one paying attention to what the others are doing.

But that doesn\u2019t make it ok that you spoke to your husband that way - particularly front of your children. It didn\u2019t negate your obligation to apologise (I realise you DID apologise, which I\u2019m glad to see).\n\nEven tonight, in a bit of an anxiety spike, I was a little short with my partner. I believe my annoyance was justified, but directing it at him was not. I apologised a couple of minutes later when I\u2019d cooled off a bit.", "Your feelings of frustration were very valid.  The way you expressed yourself was not appropriate, but it came from misunderstanding and your frustration clouded your judgment.  You felt abandoned and vulnerable, which is valid.  It was probably unintentional but it was inappropriate, even if your adult children or anyone else weren't around to hear it.\n\nYou both deserved better from each other in that moment.  Both of you need to communicate with each other better.  Don't let anger or other negative emotions stop you from talking to each other like you love each other.  Nothing good will ever come from yelling obscenities or insults at each other.", "World record for 200m dash is 19.19 for men and 21.34 for women. Average person that jogs daily it's about 36-40 seconds. If they run as fast as they can. If they jog it would be 50-60 seconds. So you were talking way longer than 20 seconds.", "I\u2019m glad you two worked it out! It sounds like you\u2019ve both come to a good understanding about the situation, so maybe going forward you can both make an effort to improve those things about yourselves that led to this in the first place. For him, definitely communication sounds like an area where he could use some improvement, and you might consider trying to work on emotional reactivity. \n\nI, too, am a relatively emotionally reactive person, and unfortunately my husband has had to bear the brunt of that on occasion as well. In the end though, I know it\u2019s my responsibility to control my emotions whether the has done something wrong or not, and that flying off the handle never helps the situation. Instead when I\u2019m feeling that anger and need to bite back, I do my best to keep that to myself, even if I need to take a minute (or 20) to calm down enough where I can talk out root of the issue (in your case here, those feelings of being abandoned/uncared for)  in a calm and productive way. Sometimes what this means is just biting my tongue in the moment, when all I really want to do is scream, and holding in that anger until I can find a healthier outlet for it than taking it out on my husband (even if he\u2019s the reason I\u2019m angry to begin with). \n\nGood luck to you both, I hope you guys dedicate some time to building up your emotional toolkits in order to help prevent other conflicts like this from happening in the future! Sounds like you\u2019re already heading down the right path.", "Maybe because it's her husband and he knows about her disabilities??? Did that really need to be spelled out for you?

Why is it her fault and not his?", "She didn\u2019t think he was going to leave her in the lot, she thought he expected her to just walk alone to the car. \nAnd also one of the kids is 19 and the other is a teenager, so I\u2019m kinda on the grounds that I think a teenager and an adult can handle some hurt feelings especially when it should be perfectly understandable why someone is upset.", "Unfortunately feeling unwell and feeling hurt by a loved a one makes a person experience emotions. Not everyone is a robot that can just shut those feelings down and be open and ready for a discussion. \n\nI\u2019d say that quick lil quip shouldn\u2019t have hurt the husband so bad he acted like a kicked dog the whole meal, all he had to do was apologize for not expressing his intentions (without Op having to ask) and seemingly OP would\u2019ve been fine with that.", "Nta. Shes not a mind reader", "And non communicating to him and claiming that she is not mind reader is ok with you? She stopped for a whole minute without telling him a word, he did not want to interrupt there, instead ran to the car and was bringing car back to get her and he is not communicating?", "That was my thought too. Teenagers can definitely handle hurt feelings and some cussing. It\u2019s honestly not a big deal..", "Martyr looking for grievances is how you\u2019re presenting yourself.", ">the end result was me walking by myself \n\nWhich, you're an adult so that's on you at the end of the day.

No, he should only apologize if he actually is sorry and means it. Empty apologies don\u2019t usually end up going well", "So it\u2019s ok for op to cuss out her husband in front of the kids over a simple misunderstanding on her part bc \u201cemotions,\u201d but at the same time it\u2019s not ok for the husband to be upset that he was insulted for no reason. Come on now with the hypocrisy.", "That lil quip? Jesus what kind of relationships are we endorsing here.", "Please apologize to your kids next.

How long do you think it took her disabled ass to get to the car? Like I said before if she had fallen and gotten hurt whose fault would have been? I see you conveniently ignored that part.", "I'm a 32 year old man and I'd feel incredibly uncomfortable listening to my mom call my dad a 'fucking asshole' in front of me. Scratch that, I'd feel uncomfortable listening to *any* couple I know speak that way to each other.\n\nRegardless of who was at fault for the initial miscommunication, there's really no excuse for blowing up like that, much less in front of your kids, short of truly egregious behavior.", "I love how OP takes accountability and you feel the need to pile on more.

It felt unnecessarily *mean* to me. \n\nI'd like to gently ask: Do you often think the worst of your partner and your children?
