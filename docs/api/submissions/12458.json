I have been living with these conditions for the past 10 years but the last year has been really hard. \n\nSo last night we went to an event as a family (my husband, two teenagers and I).   It was stormy out (high winds, snow, icy sidewalks).  We had to park maybe 400m away from the venue.  When we walked to the venue it was daylight and the sidewalks were passable.  My husband and kids walked ahead of me.  I was a bit annoyed but I let it go, not wanting to ruin the evening. \n\nAfter the event we left.  I turned away from my family for maybe 20 seconds to say good bye to someone who sat with us at the event.  When I turned around my family was halfway to the car.   I was really annoyed.  \n\nI trudged through the dark, snowy weather.  I literally could barely make it to the car because the wind was so strong and the sidewalk was quite icy at this point.  I finally made it to the parking lot and my husband pulled the car out of the parking spot and picked me up probably 10 feet from where we were parked.  \n\nI got in the car and said \u2018thanks a lot for waiting for me, fucking asshole\u2019.  My husband acted surprised and said he planned to bring the car around to pick me up.  Hearing is not one of my disabilities and my family never told me this was the plan.  \n\nWe had told the kids we\u2019d go to their favourite restaurant afterwards and we drove there in awkward silence.  When we got there my husband acted all sulky, didn\u2019t order food and was staring at his phone.   I looked at him and told him he at least owed me an apology.  He said \u2018I\u2019m sorry. It was a misunderstanding\u2019.  My daughter (19f) said I was ruining the night.  \n\nI let it go but I\u2019m still upset by the situation. \n\nSo here I am, prepared for an honest judgment.  AITAH?\n\nETA:  I accept my judgment that I was the AH.  I just spoke to my husband and apologized.  He conceded that he didn\u2019t communicate well and I told him that I shouldn\u2019t have blown up at him.\n\nI also apologized to the kids.  \n\nI still feel hurt that they took off without saying anything but I completely overreacted and I will do better moving forward.\n\nI did not preface my post in order to garner sympathy.  I was explaining why it was a big deal for me to be left to walk to the car unattended. \n\nI also did not time how long I spoke to the person we sat with (not a stranger) but I literally said goodbye and asked her to keep in touch.  I didn\u2019t have a full conversation with her.  By the time we finished talking I couldn\u2019t really see my husband and kids so I started walking by myself to the car.  When I got to the parking lot my husband was just pulling out.  \n\nI absolutely agree that my reaction was inappropriate but please don\u2019t make it sound like I\u2019m some horrible person who my family hates.   My children are my life and I have a very good relationship with them.   I had a bad night and I apologized.

Your family needs to understand that this is how things are now and that honestly it\u2019s so much worse for you then it could ever be inconvenient for them to walk slower. I recommend talking to them about it and letting them know how painful and difficult it can be for you and also how excluded you may feel when they just go off without you.

Nothing major, but it sure stings when you're washing your hands, or handling cleaning products - just doing everyday stuff - and it's not big, or bleeding, or even needing a band aid, but it's there.

You need to speak up when you get outside and tell them that somebody needs to stay with you. We teach people how to treat us; I know it's hard to ask for help but we must. Communication is key! \nI may have said the same thing at the time--I \u00e0m not perfect but I would try not to do it until we were alone.

If this was said to me or if I said it I\u2019d look at it like another Tuesday.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH. They didn\u2019t communicate their plan to drive around and pick you up. And you mentioned how icy and snowy the sidewalks were, and having any kind of mobility disability makes it extremely hard to safely walk on treacherous grounds like that. I can understand why you\u2019d be upset. Clearly the issue was a lack of communication, but I do think they should\u2019ve let you know so you wouldn\u2019t have had to worry about walking that whole way without falling. It\u2019s a valid concern and would make anyone feel alone going through that. You had a reaction that expressed how you felt and I don\u2019t think it was fair of your kid to say you were ruining the night. You could\u2019ve gotten hurt and they should\u2019ve been more empathetic. And your husband didn\u2019t have to sulk like a child and refuse to order food. He could\u2019ve also dropped the issue since you had to. Nothing is more annoying at a meal than someone sulking over something relatively minor and not eating and making everyone at the table uncomfortable Sounds like he\u2019s the one who ruined the dinner, not you.

Communication is a big part of any relationship. \n\nCommunicate your expectations, \"I don't like it when you walk ahead of me and leave me behind, it makes me feel small and like I'm not really part of the family.\" \"It's frustrating for me to rush to catch up to you like I did when you didn't even tell me your plan to pick up the car.\"\n\nLikewise, your husband's excuse of \"it was a misunderstanding\" is a dismissive, cop out excuse. It was not a misunderstanding. He chose, or out of ignorance, to not communicate his intentions to you, and you have every right to be upset. \n\nTo move forward, you need to be more clear with your expectations before they become a problem, and you need to communicate with him when you're hurt or upset. The first time you do, give him the benefit of the doubt - he's not a mind reader. But also, apologies are cheap: if he doesn't demonstrate understanding or a willingness to compromise, and demonstrate some measure of improvement, that's 100% on him and no one would blame you for escalating.", "Mild ESH but the kids, this is a general lack of communication, you could have called out and asked him to wait; he should have told you the plan, you shouldn\u2019t have blown up at him. In future maybe you need to go in and out with a game plan, like if it\u2019s an event you know is going to be busy have your husband drop you off at the door and then go find a park, and when you leave you wait for him to pick you up.", "ESH. Yes, your husband should have dropped you off first before parking and then mentioned that he\u2019d go get the car while you waited in front of the venue or at least on the sidewalk. He can work on his outward-facing consideration for you. And you should have worked on minimizing your own sulky behavior instead of demanding an apology even after you found out about your family\u2019s intent and/or the lack of communication. Also do y\u2019all not have phones? When you realized your family wasn\u2019t behind you, why didn\u2019t you call / text them to ask if they were coming to get you or not, instead of just assuming the worst and trudging through all that. You kind of played yourself too. \n\nWe all have bad nights or moments but you being unable to look past that situation and posting about it here lowkey kinda implies that you\u2019re actually unable to get past this shit, maybe you\u2019re holding onto it a little bit and were hoping to be right. But your marriage and family shouldn\u2019t be a \u201cI\u2019m right, you\u2019re wrong\u201d scenario, there shouldn\u2019t be a blame game happening or literal demands for apologies. It\u2019s a shitty thing to have dealt with, absolutely!! But your daughter\u2019s right, you were def killing the vibe by continuing the shitty situation beyond the parking lot and into the dinner environment. I mean, at least try to find SOME reason to turn y\u2019all\u2019s frowns upside down.

So that being said, maybe she could have chosen different words Maybe he isn't an assh**e but it was assh**ish.  I don't know if the kids are little or teens or what but it's not healthy for anyone to pretend that life and everything in it is all roses and sunshine. That's just downright lying to the world.
