I have been living with these conditions for the past 10 years but the last year has been really hard. \n\nSo last night we went to an event as a family (my husband, two teenagers and I).   It was stormy out (high winds, snow, icy sidewalks).  We had to park maybe 400m away from the venue.  When we walked to the venue it was daylight and the sidewalks were passable.  My husband and kids walked ahead of me.  I was a bit annoyed but I let it go, not wanting to ruin the evening. \n\nAfter the event we left.  I turned away from my family for maybe 20 seconds to say good bye to someone who sat with us at the event.  When I turned around my family was halfway to the car.   I was really annoyed.  \n\nI trudged through the dark, snowy weather.  I literally could barely make it to the car because the wind was so strong and the sidewalk was quite icy at this point.  I finally made it to the parking lot and my husband pulled the car out of the parking spot and picked me up probably 10 feet from where we were parked.  \n\nI got in the car and said \u2018thanks a lot for waiting for me, fucking asshole\u2019.  My husband acted surprised and said he planned to bring the car around to pick me up.  Hearing is not one of my disabilities and my family never told me this was the plan.  \n\nWe had told the kids we\u2019d go to their favourite restaurant afterwards and we drove there in awkward silence.  When we got there my husband acted all sulky, didn\u2019t order food and was staring at his phone.   I looked at him and told him he at least owed me an apology.  He said \u2018I\u2019m sorry. It was a misunderstanding\u2019.  My daughter (19f) said I was ruining the night.  \n\nI let it go but I\u2019m still upset by the situation. \n\nSo here I am, prepared for an honest judgment.  AITAH?\n\nETA:  I accept my judgment that I was the AH.  I just spoke to my husband and apologized.

My mom also experiences a lot of pain with her mobility issues and has trouble with certain surfaces like ice or hills. Your family needs to understand that this is how things are now and that honestly it\u2019s so much worse for you then it could ever be inconvenient for them to walk slower. I recommend talking to them about it and letting them know how painful and difficult it can be for you and also how excluded you may feel when they just go off without you.

Good luck!", ">but by the time I got to the car my anxiety was in overdrive.\n\nThat's an excuse. You'll need to stop making excuses if you want things to get better.\n\nThink about it. A part of the reason your anxiety was spiking was because you didn't say anything about what happened on the way in. You all need to remember that none of you are mind readers. Since you didn't say anything earlier, they all assumed nothing was wrong and everyone was happy. That wasn't the case though.\n\nNext time, speak up earlier, but mindfully.

I didn\u2019t communicate this time but I\u2019ve told him and the kids that I have difficulty in new situations because of my physical limitations.

Because he was going to get the car thus removing the need for you to do that.

You should NEVER call your partner an awful name. You should NEVER tell your partner to shut up. Doing this, especially in front of your children, is showing them it\u2019s ok to be treated like this (and treat others) in a relationship. This is awful behavior. Grow up, and do better for your children. They learn basic courtesy and respect from you", "Unfamiliar and unsafe. He was 400M away. Not like he dropped you in artic circle.

Did he run away from you in a dark alleyway in the middle of the night during a snowstorm?

I know you mentioned he was open to marriage counseling, but I think YOU need to be in counseling to learn more positive ways to deal with your frustration and anxiety. And if you ARE already in therapy, you need a new one. \n\nIf I\u2019m being really honest, you keep implying that divorce is or has been on the table but you haven\u2019t pulled the trigger. I\u2019m guessing because you need his help as a caregiver. And he only has to do that as long as the benefit and joy from your continued presence in his life is greater than the work and abuse you bring. Or until the youngest is out of the house.", "Because you were too busy being a victim.  YTA.  And you owe your kids an apology, too.", "Yeah, you assumed the worst... Think about how much dump you put on your relationship with hubby and kids. They probably will forgive you but they will not forget.  \n\n\nYou continue this line and wither you get divorce or get puppy and not the hubby. He will obey you but would do nothing from his own initiative since he already knows what reward would look like.", "[removed]", "Look I really don't want to be harsh. I don't think you are a bad person and it can absolutely be hard for others to understand chronic pain/illness/disability. \n\nI deal with GAD as well as mobility issues due to a spinal fusion of two of my vertebrae, so please know that while I'm making assumptions here I think I can at least somewhat relate to your experience. \n\nIt honestly really seems you are taking your frustrations about your new(ish) limitations out on your family which is leading you to assume the worst of their intentions. It almost comes across that you are scared your family sees you as a burden and will abandon you the first chance they get.\n\nI suggest the mobility aids as it may provide you with a better sense of independence, which could certainly help with your feelings of being a burden. When I had my injury the feeling of being a burden was overwhelming and it certainly caused me to snap and be short with my loved ones. It was this push and pull of anger at my lack of independence at the time, gratitude for the help, feeling infantilized since I couldn't do what others did, and most certainly anxiety and fear that my being a burden would lead to me being alone.\n\nAgain I'm making alot of assumptions here based on my own similar experiences so please accept my apologies upfront if none of this applies to you. \n\nI think as someone whose more or less come out the other side and is fully independent, regaining my sense of agency was tantamount to improving my mental health and relationships.", "If OP had called and waited at the curb, OP wouldn\u2019t be able to call her husband an assole then.", "Sometimes I feel like he is. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s left me in precarious situations and I\u2019ve gotten upset.

But I would never speak to my husband that way. You need to do some work on yourself and managing your emotions. Believe me, I get it. Going from able bodied to disabled is hard, but it\u2019s not excuse for acting the way you did. It\u2019s in you to plan for your disabilities. You could have made a plan as you walking in know it would be dark and icy when you left. \n\nIt\u2019s seems you want to place all of the responsibilities for managing your disabilities onto your husband.

My only point is that yes, it is valid for someone with mobility problems and limited vision to feel unsafe being left alone in slippery conditions.", "that's literally an excuse. Guess what, I have a moderate to severe untreated anxiety disorder. When I panic I pick up my phone and call if it's going to save me from the panic.
