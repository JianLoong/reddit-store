You're not obligated to spend go to them for holidays and you're also still giving them the option to see you guys.\n\nNTA", "It just depends on what you value. Traveled with my family of 4 for 18 years about 1800 miles twice a year or more to spend holidays with mine and my wife\u2019s family.  Had countless delays, cancelled flights, long drives, long and short layovers, flat tires, car breakdowns, and every conceivable inconvenience.  \n\nMy parents are both gone now and I don\u2019t regret my kids spending every Christmas with their grandparents.  It was worth it for me.", "NTA. We did this the first year we had a kid. My parents come to us for Christmas and we don't go anywhere. It's great.", "NAH. There is something special about kids having Christmas in their own home and parents creating new traditions. I think it's time for the parents to \"pass the torch\" so to speak. \n\nIf there are hard feelings around this, then maybe hosting duties can be rotated (if that's something you and your wife are open to). One year, you host both your families, the next year you travel, so on and so forth. It could make everything seem less exhausting.", "NAH. Spend your holidays however you want. If you want to cut the drive significantly, you could also just alternate years so you don't have to do both. And personally, 45 minute drive is a drop in the bucket to me, but I'm not you, lol. As an adult, you get to decide  how to spend the holidays for yourself. People's feelings might get hurt, especially if you're not hosting siblings at the same time, and they're allowed to be upset. But no one would be an asshole either way.", "When our kids were little, we did a three year cycle. One year was my husband\u2019s dad (his mum died years ago), one year with my family and one year at home. Nobody complained or got upset as we were giving equal time and effort to everyone.\n\nHaving kids changes things and your focus needs to be on them more", "Nah right now but if your families say no and refuse since they all live close to one another and you don\u2019t accept it or start a fight over it then you will be the ahole. Don\u2019t be surprised if they refuse since you\u2019re the one who doesn\u2019t live close. Also don\u2019t demand or offer ultimatums to anyone that will instantly put you into ahole territory. Have a conversation about how hard it is to travel with a young child and ask if possible to at least try switching next year to having you host. If everyone refuses accept it and make it clear it\u2019s not possible for you to keep doing this", "NAH. We do the long drives and multiple family events for Thanksgiving, but for Christmas we stay home. If people want to come participate in *our* holiday tradition they\u2019re more than welcome.", "NTA at all, this is what happens when you start your own family.  Your parents and in-laws should be understanding, and if they're not, then they're selfish.  Neither of those make you an AH.", "NTA\n\nIt's actually natural to shift where holidays are spent once things like this come into play. Next year, you guys host. It's still a lot of work but in a different way, but at least you're home and can put on PJs before they even pull out of the driveway.", "NTA\n\nI'm really surprised that you didn't do this when you first had your child and needed to haul a baby around for the holidays.\n\nDoing this now that you have a home that they can come see your child at, everyone is close enough that you don't need to host anyone overnight, so go for it.", "We used to go to my in-laws on Christmas eve for a big, extended family dinner, then stay the night and have a family dinner with my husband's mom, brother and his family on Christmas day (brother and his family live in the same town as mother in law, but we're two hours away).\n\nBut we have a son now, and I said they can figure out how to celebrate while we're there, but we're coming home Christmas eve and having Christmas day at our house since we have a kid who should experience waking up on Christmas and finding out what Santa brought him. I know my mother in law isn't happy, but I told her last year that it would be the last year we would be there on Christmas day. So she's had a year to get over it.", "NAH but you're getting an AH attitude. Part of growing and having a family means having to travel to take part in events. Instead of making such a big song and dance maybe start proposing an on year and off year. One year you do travelling and the next people come to you and you host it.", "NAH. You can do what you want for the holidays but I'm sure your families will be equally disappointed and that would be within their rights to be.", "NTA", "NTA. You're in the middle. It's fair for them to come to you. Especially with a young child. Plus, they don't have to cook! \n\nPS: What we do in my family is have a west holiday and an east holiday a month apart. That may be more appealing to your wife.", "NTA\n\nthe wife and I made this choice over COVID because it showed us what life is without traveling on Christmas Day.\n\nDon't get me wrong we still make the trip to them but we  do presents amd breakfast at home xmas morning , her parents on the 25th and mine on the 26th", "NTA You get to say how you want your daughter to spend the holidays. And in the car for three days isn\u2019t it.", "NTA. when my daughter was young we would try to have everyone to our house for thanksgiving. And then spread Christmas travel between Christmas and newyears. We even completely took some years off and just took a vacation to make memories with our daughter. One year we flew to San Francisco to visit her godmother for thanksgiving. One year we went to mountains for Christmas and snow. You do what makes your wife and kid happy you have to keep their love tanks full.", "NTA. If her parents and yours are capable of driving to your home, then you should just host Christmas at your house.  Your kid deserves to have a Christmas morning in their own home and not have to go traveling leaving their new stuff at home. Do it now with your new house while you can, because at some point in the not too distant future one or both sets of parents will not be able to drive and you will then feel obligated to go back to traveling about on Christmas.  Everyone coming to one place together is a lot more fun for the kid, but realize hosting Christmas will mean more work for you and your wife, cooking and cleaning up, etc.", "NTA. Years ago, my minister said, \"if you don't have kids,  you're the traveler.

I mean this is what me (and most of the families I know do) that when kids have kids of their own, they take on the energy and pressure of hosting,"]}
