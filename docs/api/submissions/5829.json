His sister, Sally (25f) had moved in with us in Feb-22. I was not comfortable with the arrangement as I am someone who really needs personal space. I had been living alone for a long time before I moved in with Harry in Jan-22. \n\nHe said he cannot ask Sally to leave as she is young, new in job and has had issues with roommates before. Also he is \u2018responsible\u2019 for her as their parents live in another city. And she is too young to live by herself in a big city (she is earning though). \n\nWe agreed to give this 6 months. In Aug-22 he said let\u2019s get married first and do this, otherwise there will be a lot of family drama and you will be seen in the bad light. I agreed. \n\nNow we are married and he has still not spoken to her or the family about Sally moving out. He told me that this will take more time. I do not see a reason to delay or a concrete plan around this. Sally had (vaguely) indicated him she wants to start a business at some point in time which would take her to another city. He is hoping this might happen and the problem will solve itself. Meanwhile he has blamed me for not being \u2018supportive to family\u2019. \n\nMeanwhile, Sally doesn\u2019t seem very grateful for this. According to Harry, Sally knows I am not comfortable with this arrangement. She comes across as a spoilt child who always gets her way through tantrums. \n\nI feel like I was taken for a ride. Manipulated. While I care for Sally, I need my personal boundaries to be respected. I need my me time. I need our couple time to develop a good foundation to our marriage. These are important and no one seems to care. \n\nAs last stop, 1 month after our marriage I told Harry I will move out. I can\u2019t fathom any other way out.

How is 25 too young to be on your own???", "Get an annulment and move on.", "NTA. The mistake was marry when he doesn't even prioritize you in the first place.", "NTA and OP got played into marriage. Sounds like both siblings have entitlement issues. Regardless of how this plays out, OP is going to be demonized for not being more \u201caccommodating.\u201d I\u2019d start being very obvious that I\u2019m researching listings with appointments, etc. If that doesn\u2019t get OP\u2019s husband talking then he NEVER will and you may as well accept the L early on. If it does then you\u2019ve already started research for Sally.", "NTA. If I had a nickel for every time someone posted about a husband marrying a woman to be his sister's servant, I'd have two. Which is weird it's happened twice (so far)", "YTA\nYou moved into his place, within a month of his sister, and got married rather quickly, while he was worried about his family having a bad impression of you.\nYou got married after less than a year, and you immediately want him to kick out his little sister.\nSomething else is going on, and I'm guessing you're jealous of their relationship. \nThe cost of living is outrageous and lots of families are sharing households.", "If Sally is incapable of taking care of her self at 25, then she never will be. Is it just your husband who\u2019s insisting she can\u2019t cope alone or are her parents saying the same thing? What are Sally\u2019s thoughts on the subject? Personally, unless it was a dire emergency I would rather chew my own leg off than live with a couple of newlyweds and I would leave as soon as I could.\n\nYou\u2019re not saying you\u2019re willing to leave over your first argument. You\u2019re willing to leave because he isn\u2019t willing to prioritise your marriage over his extended family.\n\nNTA", "NTA. But you should really leave. \nSally is 25, she\u2019s not a baby. Even an 18 yo is old enough to move out and rent a place themselves. \nAnd obviously your husband is putting Sally as priority, which I think you should really prove your point by moving out until he resolves this. Or else, he will definitely just continue with this arrangement thinking that you\u2019ll never leave him.", "NTA, husband needs to tell his sister to leave", "NTA \n\nWhat did he say when you told him you're leaving?", "NTA. Let's be clear, you've spent less than 2 months of your relationship living alone together. (Before anyone argues with my 2, I will clarify, I've put that it isn't clear how early in January OP moved in or when in February Sally moved in.)  Harry has broken the agreement about giving it six months, persuaded you to get married before she moves out, and months after that (August) conversation still not spoken with Sally? \n\nIf I were you, I'd do some flat/house hunting. If it works out with Harry, Sally could move into the place you found.\n\nOh, and 25 yo is not too young for an adult to live alone in a city, it is just possibly too early in a career to be able to earn enough to be able to afford anything more than a pokey flat on your own.", "NTA but Lol why would you marry him and accept this? Totally predictable and you literally just allowed it. Do something", "I'm guessing he's helping with his sister due to a belief system. I don't know his culture but I'm guessing it's one where family takes care of family. You knew the scoop when you moved in & married him. You should have made it clear that she needed to move BEFORE you married him. I think you are the ah for trying to change his arrangement. You should move out & do whatever you gotta do.", "NTA I feel like your husband married you in order to manipulate you into accepting his sister living there. He probably figured that if you guys married he could string you along but you would think twice about leaving. If you have any documentation is texts or something that show a discussion of her leaving once you were married you may be able to get an annulment due to marrying on false pretense. Something to discuss with a lawyer who will better know the laws regarding annulment", "She\u2019s 25! She\u2019s old enough to be married and have kids!!! Too young\u2026O M G", "NTA. Sounds like your husband has been playing for time and hoping that you'll get settled and used to the sister-in-law and stop objecting, or maybe he's hoping that he can just keep arguing you down. I'm not usually a fan of ultimatums, but here I think it sounds quite justified. Do not feel that you need to be married to somebody who either doesn't know, or doesn't care, what you need, and who doesn't listen to your opinion. \n\n25 is old enough to be in a houseshare with roommates. Stick to your guns, and if he won't budge, call his bluff and move out.", "NTA. SIL is not respecting your boundaries and your husband isn\u2019t respecting them. If she is earning enough, she can find her own place or the parents can help. You could also just make her really uncomfortable. I mean, you guys are newlyweds.", "NTA. Sore y but you fell for his little trick/game/manipulation. He backed you into a corner with the marriage. Hes sure you won\u2019t go and get divorced over his sister living there. On the other hand you pulled one over him with getting ready to move out. \n\nYou really should question this marriage tho if he\u2019s willing to pull something like this as soon as you\u2019re married.", "NTA\n\nShe is 25 not 18. He needs to stop babying her. Six months is more than enough time.\n\nHe can always help her financially to afford her first place if that's the hold up.", "25 and she can't be in a big city alone despite her earning money? I call bs on that nonsense. I was 19 when I moved out and lived iN a bIg cItY. OMG.\n\nNTA OP. You married into an enmeshed family situation. Move out and reclaim your sanity. I'd hate to live with my in-laws, no matter how much I love them. (I love them a lot.)", "NAH. I mean cmon, how did you seriously see this going? Be honest. You knew she wasn\u2019t gonna leave. He clearly values family (which, for many, is a positive quality), and you know COL is up, rent is up, apartments are hard to find. \n\nYou\u2019re N T A for wanting her out. But honestly, this is an ultimatum for you, not him. He made his choice, he wants both of you to live with him. If you want to leave, you can, but I don\u2019t think forcing her to leave will work. And I think you\u2019ll find, as I said, that finding a cheaper apartment for 1 person isn\u2019t easy, so I\u2019d find somewhere to go before saying you\u2019ll leave. \n\nAlso think you\u2019ll be hard pressed to get much sympathy IRL, for as you said bailing on your marriage 1 month in. Would not have to have that conversation with family/friends. I guess I\u2019d just say \u201cit wasn\u2019t working out.\u201d", "NTA, do not have sex with gim, get an anullment and leave, he manipulated yoy and thinks he has you trapped, leave", "NTA. Move out. File for an annulment. You were coerced into marriage under false pretenses.", "Am I the only one wondering why a brother and sister want to live with each other so bad?", "This. Also, an annulment. \n\nThere is no saving this marriage. If you stay, you'll be disregarded always. He's already lied to you to get sister in the house and to pressure you to get married. That's not going to stop. If you go and reconcile, his already difficult family will be against you forever and he will probably resent you as he seemingly values the cousin over you.", "Op needs to make sure she doesn\u2019t get pregnant, if he thinks she\u2019s serious he may try to further trap her with a baby.", "My thoughts exactly.  You only get one honeymoon phase and to blow that?!  He\u2019s clearly demonstrating his priorities.", "Yes 25YO and \u201ccan\u2019t live with roommates\u201d sounds like she just needs to get her shit together and not be childish. Plenty of people from 17-70 coexist peacefully with their roommates", "Also, a part that I think is really being glossed over is how you were previously used to living alone. You only lived as a couple for a month if my comprehension is correct?", "Sister*", " YOU are his family but he doesn\u2019t give a shit about supporting you and your happiness.", "I'm sorry, but bluntly... why did you marry this man? He already showed you that his sister, and family, will always be a higher priority than you.", "It wasn't ideal, but I first paid rent at 16.\n\nThe idea of 25 being \"too young\" to live in your own is nuts. I know some cultures you live at home til marriage but this doesn't sound like it's one of those situations.\n\nI can't imagine being 25 and not paying rent. If she went through something awful or truly couldn't afford it but was being helpful around the house and seeking employment or something then that would be one thing, but she just sounds spoiled as hell. \n\nI think the only way out of this for you is separation, at least temporarily, if not annulment.", "Good catch, I'll fix it now.", "Partial comment stolen from u/mighty-mango\n\nu/adificaxcv is a bot", "He promised her something she wanted if she did something he wanted. She was in love and was seeing the positive and viewing him through a lens of good intentions because she likely couldn't fathom treated someone this way herself. \n\nPeople like this can be incredibly manipulative. I've had an ex sit in front of my telling me bold face lies that I knew weren't true. It helped me forgive myself in that moment for believing his other nonsense because he was so convincing that if I hadn't known 100% what he was saying was false, I would have believed him.\n\nIt's not just rose coloured glasses of love and not being able to comprehend being manipulative and misleading to someone you're supposed to love... People like this are very good at lying with bits of the truth (extra convincing). Then they get to know you and tailor their BS so it's extra believable for their victim. \n\nIt's extremely common for abusive people to let their mask slip after relationship milestones when they feel they've trapped their victim."]}
