His sister, Sally (25f) had moved in with us in Feb-22. I was not comfortable with the arrangement as I am someone who really needs personal space. I had been living alone for a long time before I moved in with Harry in Jan-22. \n\nHe said he cannot ask Sally to leave as she is young, new in job and has had issues with roommates before. Also he is \u2018responsible\u2019 for her as their parents live in another city. And she is too young to live by herself in a big city (she is earning though). \n\nWe agreed to give this 6 months. In Aug-22 he said let\u2019s get married first and do this, otherwise there will be a lot of family drama and you will be seen in the bad light. I agreed. \n\nNow we are married and he has still not spoken to her or the family about Sally moving out. He told me that this will take more time. I do not see a reason to delay or a concrete plan around this. Sally had (vaguely) indicated him she wants to start a business at some point in time which would take her to another city. He is hoping this might happen and the problem will solve itself. Meanwhile he has blamed me for not being \u2018supportive to family\u2019. \n\nMeanwhile, Sally doesn\u2019t seem very grateful for this. According to Harry, Sally knows I am not comfortable with this arrangement. She comes across as a spoilt child who always gets her way through tantrums. \n\nI feel like I was taken for a ride. Manipulated. While I care for Sally, I need my personal boundaries to be respected. I need my me time. I need our couple time to develop a good foundation to our marriage. These are important and no one seems to care. \n\nAs last stop, 1 month after our marriage I told Harry I will move out. I can\u2019t fathom any other way out.

It is time to cut your losses and leave.", "I literally bought my own house at age 20. 25 is plenty old enough to figure your shit out, she's freeloading.", "Alone is better than disrespected in her own home by someone clearly manipulative and uninterested in what she has to say", "If you leased the place together, having a permanent houseguest is often against the lease. In my area, many leases only allow guests for two weeks. In that case, could you notify the landlord?", "A divorce made the other the ex husband/wife, with all the rights that this implies. \n\nA annulment is like you was never married, not giving rights to the ex and allowing you to said legally that you was never married.", "Speak to an attorney and find out exactly what in your region.", "I was on my own at 18\u2026. 25 is absolutely old enough. \n\nNTA.", "NTA", "NTA. Leave.", "NTA... 25 is not \u201ctoo young\u201d to live alone in a big city. Multiple of my friends moved to NYC and lived alone directly after college at \u201conly\u201d 22 years old.\n\nThis also may be your first disagreement as a married couple, however it\u2019s a disagreement that started quite sometime before you were married and honestly something that should have been resolved before the ceremony. Regardless, since your husband has known how you feel about this for months and refuses to respect you to the point he essentially tricked you (perhaps he thought once you\u2019re married you\u2019ll drop it, or at least wanted to be married to prevent you from easily leaving him knowing you\u2019re unhappy with the arrangement) there\u2019s nothing wrong with an ultimatum telling him you will move out. Being intimate as a couple is hard when there\u2019s a third person living with you, and not just sex wise. Not to mention, are you supposed to wait to plan for kids (if you want them) until his sister moves out? \n\nAnyway... there\u2019s always annulment possible..", "NTA. Run. His attachment to her is creepy.", "NTA. Shes 25 and he thinks shes too young to live on her own!? I started my career and moved 3 states away ON MY OWN at 23! Stand your ground. This is nuts.", "Did I read things correctly that the sister is 25-years old...as in an ADULT?  Harry is spineless and needs to kick sis to the curb though you may also want to consider who attached your wagon to.", "Annulments are easier than divorces. NTA, but it sucks that your husband respects his sister more than his wife.", "NTA - But you should have told your (then) boyfriend that you weren't moving in with him until it was just you two.  She is 25.  I had been on my own for 8 years by that time.  She is not 'too young'.   She's just too coddled and entitled.", "NTA holy heck 25 is not old enough for her to live alone?!? I was living alone at 18. You were manipulated.", "NTA\n\nBut...do not issue an ultimatum unless you're going to follow it. Please start looking for your own place as well as retaining a lawyer.", "NTA", "Sorry, but OP Should NOT move out,  it is her home, it would be better to make them both leave. NTA", "Op moved in with him. So yeah, she needs to just leave. He didn't move in with her and if you seriously think this inconsiderate man would vacate and take his sister, you're wrong. This guy views himself as \"the boss\".", "NTA! THIS WAS ME!!!! Omg I was an only child liked my alone time. Hubby was manipulated by his mom as \u201cfamily comes first\u201d meaning HIS family not me. I have had to put up with his older sister, his mom AND his brother at some point. Thank god his little sis didn\u2019t move in but she came to my job and house and screamed at me, threatened to call cps and have my kids taken away. Just aweful stuff. I was done. I gave my husband the ultimatum of me or them and he reluctantly chose me. It\u2019s been a hell marriage as the \u201cI kicked my mom out for you what else do you want\u201d has come up often. Just get out! I wasted 10 years trying to get him to do counseling and compromising (which was me giving up something to make him happy) and I\u2019m miserable. His BS statements of I love you were just manipulation. Your situation may or may not be that bad but honestly your in a threesome marriage. You married him and his sister. He might choose you but he will hold that shit over your head.", "NTA\n\nLet's put this into a simpler terms OP:  His sister moves in, giving you no alone time with him.  He only placates you and lies to you to get you to accept the situation.  Then about the time she is suppose to move out he asks you to marry him.  This is not cause he loves you, but cause he is starting to feel the financial burden of his adult younger sister living there rent free, and potentially violating his lease.  And you agree and still he can not seem to let her go, using the family card, and guilt to manipulate you into going along with the situation all the while guess who is starting to pay more of the bills, and put out money for an adult who now wants to start her very own business.  \n\nOp, pack up your stuff and leave, make sure your finances are separated, and that you are not on the lease.  And then get an annulment from this marriage and move away from him, cause someone who would out right lie to you and manipulate you is not worth it.  The sex is not that good, and you should not be going through a nightmare situation with a partner who is not going to listen, consider what you have to say and has proven to not be the person who you can trust.  And what is worse is that since he is doing this with his sister, how are you with your MIL, or does she even know that you are his wife?  What are her feelings about you, and are you ready for her to come and stay for a while?", "NTA but maybe try marriage counselling first.", "NTA\n\nI'd be moving out too.  Sally has probably been enabled her whole life by her parents and her brother.  When she wants something, she'll throw a tantrum till she gets it.\n\nYour husband has shown you that his loyalty is to his sister and not to his wife.\n\nI'd move out and file for divorce (if you can't get annulment - possibly too late for that but depends on where you live and the rest of your circumstance).\n\nBetter you get out now, than drag this out for a few more month, or worse, years.", "NTA move out and get an annulment you aren't a priority in his life.if you stay married divorce will be tough you don't want to put yourself through that.", "NTA", "NTA. You need to take care of you - your \u2018husband\u2019 is taking care of his sister. Sounds like he forgot the part of his wedding vows - to forsake all others. Sending you a virtual hug. You\u2019ve got this! Please keep us posted.", "He sounds like a con man. NTA and run, OP.", "You are right, I thought I read it was the other way around. Then, Leave would be the right answer.", "She can get herself therapy if she has a problem keeping roommates. This isn\u2019t a real excuse."]}
