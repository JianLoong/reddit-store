His sister, Sally (25f) had moved in with us in Feb-22. I was not comfortable with the arrangement as I am someone who really needs personal space. I had been living alone for a long time before I moved in with Harry in Jan-22. \n\nHe said he cannot ask Sally to leave as she is young, new in job and has had issues with roommates before. Also he is \u2018responsible\u2019 for her as their parents live in another city. And she is too young to live by herself in a big city (she is earning though). \n\nWe agreed to give this 6 months. In Aug-22 he said let\u2019s get married first and do this, otherwise there will be a lot of family drama and you will be seen in the bad light. I agreed. \n\nNow we are married and he has still not spoken to her or the family about Sally moving out. He told me that this will take more time. I do not see a reason to delay or a concrete plan around this. Sally had (vaguely) indicated him she wants to start a business at some point in time which would take her to another city. He is hoping this might happen and the problem will solve itself. Meanwhile he has blamed me for not being \u2018supportive to family\u2019. \n\nMeanwhile, Sally doesn\u2019t seem very grateful for this. According to Harry, Sally knows I am not comfortable with this arrangement. She comes across as a spoilt child who always gets her way through tantrums. \n\nI feel like I was taken for a ride. Manipulated. While I care for Sally, I need my personal boundaries to be respected. I need my me time. I need our couple time to develop a good foundation to our marriage. These are important and no one seems to care. \n\nAs last stop, 1 month after our marriage I told Harry I will move out. I can\u2019t fathom any other way out. It\u2019s just been 1 month of us as married couple and I am already bailing out on our first disagreement. \n\nAm I am asshole here ?", "created_utc": 1672209716, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zx2pov/aita_for_telling_my_husband_if_my_sisterinlaw/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about age as much; his sister is struggling and has no where else to go. Whether she\u2018s 17 or 30, in a time of struggle, your family is who\u2019ll support you, so giving him this choice between his wife or sister is an ass move. At the same time, because it\u2019s been going on for a while I get where you\u2019re coming from with how this can be annoying. Especially because she isn\u2019t paying rent and just seems like a burden.\n\nI think the best thing to do it talk to HER about this instead of giving your husband the ultimatum.
