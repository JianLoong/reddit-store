Dave is the kind of guy that doesn't take the initiative to do things for himself; because of this,  a lot of self-development opportunities has passed him by and at the time, I had to be the one to pick up his slack due to me being the one earning more than my brothers. It was taking a toll on me financially and emotionally, not only because as I was paying rent for a place I didn't like, due to my brother's inability to afford their share of the rent, but also because I took the initiative to try and  help Dave with his personal development: teaching him how to drive and offering to help to him with his pivot to a web dev career (For context: I work in tech and  at the time I had the opportunity to refer him for a role, if he finished his online course) . When I got a better paying job, I decided to move out to a 1bdrm for my peace of mind, against everyone's wishes.  Fast forward to this year, he got laid off and can't work due to immigration issues and now, my family's solution for him is to move in with me. I'm completely against it, because I feel like I'll be going back to that unhealthy space, seeing that I'll be expected to keep him accountable. Alex tells me that I'm being irrational and immature.

You moved out. You chose an apartment which is unsuitable for roommates. You took all the steps to be healthy and productive in your life. You're succeeding. Good for you.\n\nI did notice you said something about immigration issues, so I assume there is some cultural element at play which prioritizes family first. We'll, I'm here to encourage you to discard unhealthy, toxic generational norms in favor of making choices which actually help family members. As long as people enable OB to be a screw up, he will. Helping OB means letting him experience loving, healthy boundaries.\n\nOB is TA. Your family needs to be telling OB - the eldest - to get his act together. And the elders need to be respectfully informed that you are happy to be supportive of people who are actively engaged with uplifting themselves. It's not your responsibility to carry the weight. It is unhelpful to enable people who exploit 'the system', as it were. \n\nAs the child who ended up with the means to continue what I called The National Bank of Mom and Dad, those patterns die hard. It has taken a lot of backbone to not fix everyone's broken car, leaking roof, or close the gap when they're short on cash until payday. But, it can be done. I reviewed budgeting. I discussed saving. I gave them all the information they needed to not keep taking out loans that would never be repaid. It can be done. And yes, every step of the way I felt like the A. You are NTA.

At the end of the day it\u2019s your decision and you cannot let your family force one on you.

It doesn't mean you have to sacrifice having your own life, your own home and space, your own freedom. The same is tru for Alex. Neither one of you need to carry Dave. You've helped. He has zero incentive to learn if he has one or both of you brothers as his safety net. You've been assuming that he couldn't do for himself, that he only needed some teaching/encouragement. What you've failed to see is that he doesn't WANT to take care of himself. He's only going to find his way to being self-reliant when he absolutely has to.

Maybe it's time for Alex to play the parent that Dave needs this time? I think you did your time - for both of them.", "NTA. It\u2019s always easier for others to suggest a solution that doesn\u2019t effect them. Why can he just stay with your family or Alex?", "NTA\nIt's a one bedroom for a reason. No ia a complete sentence so say no. Don't open the door to him because once he is in he won't leave.  Ignore all communication regarding him once you have said no. You ever hear the saying don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm? Do not let him in.", "NTA. Calling you irresponsible is pretty rich coming from him", "NTA You are not responsible for your brother.  He is an adult, and he can move back home with your parents or move in with other relatives.  You've helped him before; it is time he helped himself.  Tell your family it's their turn to support Dave.  You deserve your peace of mind and your own space.", "NTA.  Your family can come up with any solution they want.  Until it's a solution you agree with nothing will happen.  He's an adult.  He can figure it out.  You can help in other ways like:\n\n- offering to review his resume \n\n-do mock interviews with him\n\n-see if he's having any difficulties with unemployment signup \n\n-help him see if he'd qualify for other assistance programs (possibly Medicaid if he lost his health insurance or cobra is too much it really depends on his income)\n\n- help him come up with a budget\n\n- find staffing and temp agencies for him to get registered with so he can get some money coming in while looking for a permanent job.  If he's on unemployment he'd have to accurately report his income.  Also unemployment is only 26 weeks so if he has a temp job for a week and it's more than unemployment he should be able to skip that week.\n\nNotice none of these involve him moving.  They're all designed to help him with getting an income until he gets another job.  That should be the first goal.  Failing that.... well everyone thinking he should move in with you can let him stay with them for 29 days until he moves to the next person's home (29 because in my state he'd get tenant rights at 30 days of continuous inhabitation.  Yes even without rent or a lease).", "Alex moved in with is partner the moment it got inconvenient for him \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.", "This is wisdom.", "He moved in with his partner a year after Dave moved in with us.", "Alex and his partner have more room, I bet.

He's only trying to guilt you into taking in Dave so he won't have to.\n\nAnyone telling you to let you move in   Dave, tell them he should move in with them instead and then listen to the excuses start coming in. No one wants the problem that is Dave. They only want him to stop being a problem, without them lifting a finger to make it so. \n\nDon't take him in, no matter how much they pressure you. Your mental health and peace of mind is important. And this is a good time for Dave to take responsibility for himself. If no one is rushing to take him in, he'll have to be responsible for once in his life. \n\nNTA\n\nEdited.", "So there's a place for Dave to move to, since Alex is so passionate about SOMEONE taking Dave in.
