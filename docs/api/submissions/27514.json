We had a nursery decorated and for the past year, the nursery had just been sitting untouched in our house. I hated seeing it honestly. It reminded me of everything that could have been and just brought back bad memories. My wife, on the other hand, loved the room because she felt that it was the last remaining piece on Earth of our baby so it held great sentimental value, and wanted to use it for any future kid. I recently started a new work-from-home job that I really should have an office for, but I don't and it's very inconvenient. We don't have any spare rooms in our house that I could use as an office, besides the nursery. So I started the process of turning the nursery into an office and my wife is very mad about it. I'm talking like ready to divorce me over it. I don't see the big deal, it was just staying unused and it is now finally going to be used for something productive. And it's not like I threw away the stuff that was in the room, I packed it away nicely in storage. If we have another baby, we can just move into a bigger place with more rooms.

You should have talked to your wife about converting the room into an office.  On the other hand, if you did talk about it and could not reach a compromise, then somebody is going to be unhappy.  I cannot say it should be you and I cannot say it should be her.  However, I am in favor of letting go of the past and using the room for the benefit of the living.  Your wife probably needs therapy to move on.", "YTA\n\nPeople deal with grief in different ways. This should have been done step by step with the help of counseling. \nYou can choose to not go into that room and not have the sore reminder. She still needed that room intact or at least needed more time to gradually get used to changing it. You took that away from her and this is not one of those things where it's better to just rip off the band-aid. If that was what she needed, she would have helped you tear it all down.\n\nThere are plenty of limited space office solutions in the world you could have installed in your home. There are wall mounted pull out desks or even convertible night stands/dressers you could have set up in the master bedroom or living room. It wouldn't be in the way outside of working hours. It would have created some obviously necessary time to slowly move towards changing the purpose of the room that would once serve as a nursery, with the help of a counselor.", "Yta. While you wouldn\u2019t be one for grieving differently and wanting to move on faster than she does, you had no right to take that one physical reminder of your child away from her. There\u2019s a reason the divorce rate is around 80% for parents after losing a child. Get in couples therapy asap if you want to make your marriage last. I am sorry for  your loss though.", "YTA, This May cost you your marriage, what a terrible thing to do. You took your partner\u2019s comfort and solace away.", "YTA! This is something that should have been discussed beforehand and not just pounced upon by you.\n\n\nThe fact that you don't see why it is a big deal to her is extremely concerning. No wonder she is divorce ready. Her grief combined with your decision is hurting her and you are too ignorant to see it.", "YTA. You should have discussed it with your wife. You should have looked into both individual and couples therapy for both of you to process the loss. Changes should have been a group discussion. \nYou seem to be aware of how important that room was for her, so I cannot fathom how you are asking if you were in the wrong.", "Yta not because you want to change the room or feel different from your wife. But you honestly didn't think that doing something like that without telling her and communicating your issues is okay? It sounds like you did it without telling her because you knew she wouldn't give up easily and thought she would give up after the deed was done rather than try to talk it out and compromise together.\nEveryone grieves differently.  You should've told her how the room made you feel.", ">My wife, on the other hand, loved the room because she felt that it was the last remaining piece on Earth of our baby so it held great sentimental value, \n\nThis is the big deal. You are either in denial or fibbing if you believe it isn't a big deal to your wife.\n\nIt's unclear if you discussed the change with your wife. If you didn't then Y-T-A\n\nIf you did and couldn't come to a compromise then N-A-H and your wife needs therapy to find ways to keep the child's memory alive while moving forward with life.\n\nEither way, I'm sorry for your loss and hope y'all find a way forward together.", "YTA.

You did this the exact wrong way.", "YTA if you did this without discussing with your wife. This was the place she felt close to the baby, where she could go when she needed to process her feelings and you took it away from her. You said \u201cI hated seeing it\u201d so you took it down, you put your feelings ahead of your wife\u2019s. This decision should have been made together.", "You should have spoken to her first, and you know it, too, because you were aware it held sentimental value. Whichever way it plays out, good luck, but if you don't want to lose your marriage, I'd start thinking about converting that room back... rapidly.\n\nThat said, I'm sorry for your loss.", "YTA for not making this a joint decision.", "Yta. Your wife is still grieving and you\u2019re not being supportive. You\u2019ve blindsiding her in a spot that is extremely vulnerable. You better apologize or there will never be any future children. She needs to see grief counselling and you both should see relationship counselling because there is definitely a lack od compassion and respect with your actions.", "YTA. You did throw away something, which is the room. It can no longer be used by your wife as the place to dream about what could've been. Now, even that last bit of memory of your Baby is dead and you killed it. Of course the Wife isn't thrilled about it...", "Your feelings about the nursery are valid, but on the basis that it sounds like you didn't discuss this with your wife beforehand, whilst being aware of her feelings - YTA.", "YTA.\n\nPeople do grieve in different ways. Your wife finds a special connection to this room, and to the baby that will never grow up.\n\nYou, on the other hand, seem to have taken a \"I couldn't possibly care less\" attitude, with a dash of \"damn her soul-crushing heartbreak is so inconvenient for me.\"\n\nDo better.\n\nYTA", "YTA. You should have discussed this with your wife prior to taking everything down.

No. But maybe with the proper support she might have started to get to a place where she was ready to pack some things away.", "YTA. You should not have made that decision without her. You both need to go to therapy.", "YTA", "This is something you two should have sat down and talked about before you just started moving things. Your wife needs counseling.", "YTA.

Understand when a child dies it takes a lot of time to get over it. I understand both sides tbh. You are the practical person /who also grieved \\ but she is still grieving. Please don\u2019t do this and make another plan. If you love your wife, let her grieve. Its hard enough.", "YTA\n\nFirst, knowing how much sentimental value of that room means to your wife, you made a decision WITHOUT even discussing it with her to dismantle the nursery and replace it with an office\n\nSecond, you don\u2019t get to decide for your wife when she will stop grieving and be ready to move on\n\nAnd lastly, now you are on Reddit to try and steamroll over your wife\u2019s feelings and invalidate so you don\u2019t have to acknowledge your despicable behavior \n\nSo far all you have been in the post is whine whine whine me me me\n\nMarriage is a partnership, clearly something you can\u2019t hack\n\nI hope your wife divorces you", "ESH... you changing the room while she's still still clinging to the presence she feels is wrong. Her not being willing to change the room while it's upsetting to you is wrong. I'd suggest some therapy for your both to help with the grieving process. You and your wife need to learn to communicate better and take each others feelings into account. Not sure why you are getting so many nasty comments considering you are also grieving and seeing the room was upsetting for you.", "NAH. You both have valid reasons for wanting that room to be the way you want it. Yours are more practical (although they have an emotional component to be sure), and hers are more emotional, which makes it hard to apply logic to come to a resolution.\n\nMaybe counseling would be useful, if only to have an objective third party (other than Reddit) weigh in. It would be a shame for that to be the thing you get divorced over - that seems like an extreme reaction.\n\nMy condolences on your loss. I can't even imagine.", "No, you\u2019re not an AH. But, your wife has a different perception. Consider some coping couples therapy to process your different views, but honor her feelings.", "No you\u2019re not the AH. You both have different ways of processing the loss. You would rather move on and not linger. Your wife is clearly sentimental of it. In practicality, it is more healthy to move on but also to remember. Having an entire room stuck in limbo in my opinion isn\u2019t the healthiest way to cope. YATA if you expect her to just understand, you need to support her every step of the way and be sympathetic but firm that this action will be overall beneficial to the both of you. Offer to go to couples therapy?", "NAH, but she needs to recognize her grief is becoming an issue for others.", "I want to say NTA because it's dumb to keep a room just to be sad in it, but YTA for not giving your wife enough time to process.\nI would stop changing it for a while and insist she go to therapy.", "ESH. She\u2019s thinking she\u2019ll just use the exact same room/setup for a new baby? She needs help, but you really should be her main source of support.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When making memories with a child is stripped away from a mother, very often the need to keep whatever especially touchable memories we did get to experience,alive. For her this touchable memory was decorating, spending time nesting in the nursery.\n\nFor fathers/partners it's most commonly a little different. Naturally they don't share the same experience a carrying mother does. Their bond is with a baby is different and intensifies over physical touch, eye contact, passing time etc. So their need for keeping a touchable memory \"alive\" is often much shorter or non existent. Very often the very sight of it will hurt more. \n\nThat's the difference, OP could have quite literally kept that door closed and so not have to face this painful reminder. Their partner now has been stripped from the choice or at least from the process of slowly letting said nursery go.", "No, it's an individual thing.
