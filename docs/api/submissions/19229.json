If he did i still would've invited him but he shows no sign of regret. On last year's Thanksgiving he kept giving my son looks and snickering about him. My husband and i are fighting alot because he wants me to invite my SIL's son but me and my son don't want to invite him. He threatened to leave me if i don't, but im still sticking with my decision. AITA? \n\nSorry if there is some mistake English is not my first language\n\nSLIGHT EDIT: I've seen many people saying that i shouldn't have invited one of my SIL's kids and not the other, i just wanted to clarify my SIL's second son is very close to my son so my son didn't like the idea of not inviting him just because his brother is not invited her second son has helped my son in difficult situations so he didn't think it was fair to not invite him.", "created_utc": 1686154964, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143hpge/aita_for_not_wanting_to_invite_my_husbands/", "score": 124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Protect your child.", "NTA, \"... he still hasn't apologized to my son.\" WTF is wrong with your SIL that she hasn't made that happen? In fact you're too nice to even invite the 2nd son, I'd go NC with that entire family.", "NTA.\nStand your ground.\nIf you invite him in best hope, he will still bully your kid and worse, your son would lose faith in you as well.\n\n\nTry to avoid altercation with your husband, try to keep discussing civil but do no flinch.\n\nIt's a hill worth dying on .\n\nYour husband is definitely an AH.\n\nYou are NTA.", "NTA for not inviting your son's bully, but why did you even invite SIL's other son?\n\nYour SIL is obviously aware that one of her sons is a bully, and that your son is his victim.  At Thanksgiving the bully's behavior continued, although perhaps not as severely a before.  Did SIL even step up and correct her son's behavior?  If not, she is part of the problem.  And she's trying to force you to keep exposing your son to her toxic child by denying you access to your other nephew.  \n\nThe bullying won't stop if SIL doesn't address her son's behavior.  And it's your job, and your husband's, to protect your son.  Don't let SIL or any of her family be around your son until the bullying stops.\n\nYour husband should be supporting you and your son, not SIL.  If he threatens to leave, call his bluff.  If he does leave, it will be better for your son not to be around someone who would sacrifice his safety and well-being for peace in the extended family.", "Whoa, that was quite the gauntlet at the end. If your husband would seriously leave YOU over some kid drama, he's trash. Even just threatening- trash. \n\nAnd besides that he should be behind his kid, not his bully nephew. You're almost absolutely right, although I think you would have steered clear(er) of drama if you hadn't invited either of the cousins. Not saying it was right or wrong, just more likely to cause problems.\n\nKeep staying on your son's side. Sounds like he's got only you over there", "NTA, your husband, his sister, and her kids all fuckin suck. Thank you for looking out for your son", "NTA. A bully doesn't get to come to your kids birthday party- it would literally ruin his birthday. If SIL cares so much about not getting an invite maybe she should stop her kid from being a bully and make him apologize and then watch him like a hawk to make sure he's not still being a bully. Don't ruin your kids' day over his jerkoff cousin. Your husband can do whatever he want, but not putting his own child's needs and safety above an abusive nephew is bizarre.", "NTA \n\nNobody should have to spend their birthday with their bully! You're doing what's right for your son and if your husband can't see that, he can go live with his sister and her mean kid. Your nephew isn't going to learn anything if he gets invited to a party after mistreating your son.", "NTA- your son gets to enjoy his birthday without having his bully present.  I'd leave husband if he cannot understand WHY you'd not want your son bullied.", "It's your son's birthday and inviting his bully to it sounds like a highway to trust issues between him and you(both). You are supposed to first think about your children then about anyone else and inviting a bully of his doesn't sound like what a caring parent would do. \n\nYou can offer an ultimatum to the SIL's kid to apologize sincerely or not come at all but only if your son agrees with the plan.\n\nOf course you're NTA", "NTA but I wouldn't invite one son and not the other. Just don't invite your SIL at all.  \nIf your husband wants to leave you over who gets invited to the party and generally over protecting your son then you are clearly better off without him and all of his side of the family.", "NTA and it sounds like your husband doesn\u2019t really care for you and your son, if he\u2019s willing to leave so easily over this then maybe it\u2019s a sign for you to take a closer look at other things that you might have overlooked in the past.", "NTA.\n\nIf SIL is having trouble understanding that *your son* was being ~~bullied~~ tormented by her son, that's on her. The fact that her first son hasn't apologized, and \n> On last year's Thanksgiving he kept giving my son looks and snickering about him\n\ntells me that your SIL hasn't even tried to understand the problem.\n\nYour husband, though. Threatening to leave you over this? There's more going on here, I'm afraid.\n\nHe's probably trying to \"save face\" in front of his extended family.\n\nWhat a mess.", "NTA. If you care at all about your son you'll take your husband up on his offer.", "NTA your husband+family sucks", "NTA\nIt is your son's party. He is old enough to say who he wants at his party. It makes sense not to invite his cousin who has been bullying him and shown no remorse. You probably should just have not have invited anyone from that family though as inviting one nephew but not the other was bound to cause problems. A 12 year old is also old enough to have just a friend party or decided to celebrate another way  instead of an extended family party and maybe that would have been a better route.", "NTA\n\nI think as a parent your loyalty and job is to your child first and it sounds like you are trying your best to do that. The fact that he would threaten to leave over this leads me to believe there is something more going on but that would be for you to decide or sort out. Either way, as tough as it is, if someone is toxic (no matter their relationship) bending to them is not healthy.", "NTA-  YOU should be the one threatening to leave.\n\n Your husband has been enabling his sister letting her son bully yours for so long that he doesn\u2019t even think it\u2019s a big deal.\n\nIt\u2019s your job as parents to protect your child and your husband if more concerned with pleasing his family.\n\nYour husband is the biggest bully here.\n\nLet him leave .", ">he wants me to invite my SIL's son  \n>  \n>he threatened to leave me if i don't\n\nThis says everything you need to know about him. Let him leave, he'll be back with the tail between his legs", "Nta", "NTA. But it wasn't right to invite one and not the other. Your husband is the real AH here and if his relatives' feelings are more important to him than his own son's, then call his bluff and show him the door.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Keep that child away from your son", "NTA, except for the bit where you would've invited him if he apologized. That's not for you to decide; your son is old enough to decide for himself whether he accepts the apology, and if he does if he trusts his cousin enough to be around him. If he's never willing to be around his cousin again... that's the consequence of being a bully. Your son shouldn't have to act close with someone who was cruel to him if he doesn't want to.
