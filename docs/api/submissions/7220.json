Can you hire a babysitter to hang out in the church's nursery during the ceremony?

But have you thought about hiring a babysitter for the event so for the other parents that are bringing their small invited children?

Just don't even put it in her hands", "NTA, but you would be wrong for not inviting.  It's your wedding, but you can't single out one niece/nephew and invite the others.  Either it's child-free or not.  No offense, but your MIL is grown and if she can't tell her daughter NO, then, I'm sorry, she has helped foster your SIL's entitled behavior.  Simple solution, disinvite Georgie if she can't get it together, plus I would've bounced the dog right-back out the door.", "This is exactly what I was thinking. Clearly she doesn't listen to instruction and has proven this multiple times. If you invite her, she will bring the baby. The only way to negate this is to not invite Georgie.", "She might bring the dog, too", "The problem then becomes that it will be applied to every guest. So if OP only wants to invite the fianc\u00e9\u2019s nieces and nephews, other guests with children older than infants or toddlers are going to question this policy. Normal people will RSVP for the names solely addressed on the cards. OP needs to distinguish this by writing: Dr/Mx/Mr/Mrs/Ms Smith for the folks whose children aren\u2019t invited, and writing The Smith Family for the folks whose children are welcome to attend.\n\nTBH, I think the invitation should say something to the effect of \u201cchild free, including infants\u201d, and they make their exceptions privately amongst family members. It stirs up too much drama otherwise, and gives them more work than necessary before the wedding (answering people\u2019s calls and having to say no a zillion times when asked if their children are invited). People might get upset about exceptions but it\u2019s really up to the host\u2019s discretion. \n\nUnfortunately not covering the infant in the children of immediate family only is a tough one. To an outsider who has no context of the history of the family dynamic  it might raise eyebrows but that\u2019s the risk you run when you host a wedding and make exceptions. To avoid BS, I would strongly recommend letting the FMIL and fianc\u00e9 handle Georgie. It\u2019s not appropriate to have OP wrangling her.", "Sounds like a win-win situation", "They don't want Georgie at the wedding. None of OP's concerns have anything to do with the baby & everything to do with Georgie. Except they don't want to NOT invite her, and the best excuse they could come up with is the baby. Only it's a terrible idea, because it wouldn't work. Georgie would come anyway with the baby and cause a scene because nobody wants to stand up to the awful person and actually hold a line. They draw chalk lines and pretend it's a boundary, and then get all shocked face when she steps over it--like most families with drama llamas do, because everyone is scared of the bully & how they'll react. So the bully gets their way, and the OPs are always frustrated because nice people fear being called not nice people.", "There are two exceptions to this rule though. Spouses to be\u2019s kiddos (either together or from a previous marriage). Soft exception is for kiddos who are part of the wedding processional (ring barer, flower girl, jr groomsmen/jr bridesmaid, and, in some cases, Maid of Honor or best man). I\u2019ve also seen exceptions in which the folks getting married allowed their friend to bring their infant during the reception so that they could chest feed (one parent has the infant during the ceremony and they take shifts during the reception so both can enjoy the festivities\u2026much harder to do when the person is a single parent).", "Of course she'll bring the dog. Who else will watch the baby while she eats & dances the Macarena at the reception?", "Yes, this is good. Make it official. Also, you don't want your friend to get attacked by Georgie, her dog, her potentially awful plus one, the poor baby...  The best you can probably do without a blowup with the family is hire a bouncer to manage the crowd, a babysitter to manage the baby, and ask the priest for an extra prayer for peace in advance. ;)", "Huh? People want childfree weddings because they don\u2019t want their vows interrupted by crying and screaming, the dancefloor monopolized by toddlers running through it, and their guests having to leave early to take cranky kids home.

But she won\u2019t even agree to do that", "My fianc\u00e9 is the one more worried about disruption during the ceremony. He and his sister have a complicated relationship usually and this would only add to that underlying fact\n\nWe picked and announced our wedding date (paying the deposit) before she told anyone she was pregnant. We are paying for everything out of our own pockets and moving it (incurring charges for all suppliers) isn\u2019t financially feasible. \n\nThe baby crying / any distraction towards what we envision to be a really treasured moment in our lives is a big deal to US.", "I agree! \nIt sounds like OP \u201chas\u201d to invite Georgie though. Please note, has is in quotes. Yes, OP DOES technically have a choice. \nIt is also almost guaranteed Georgie will bring the baby. And even if Georgie is NOT invited will likely show up with baby in arms or, at best, drive OP crazy with tantrums from now until forever. \nTrying to find a solution\u2026 perhaps OP can hire a sitter for the baby and tell Georgie arrangements have been made for baby in a room adjacent to the ceremony and reception. OP should tell Georgie she (Georgie) will need to pay the fee of $. Of course, Georgie likely won\u2019t pay\u2026 and OP will be slapped with the cost. \nEven still, this may be a small price to pay to ensure baby isn\u2019t in the arms of MIL the whole time and baby isn\u2019t crying in the room during the vows. \nGeorgie and people like her drive me crazy! Their tantrums screw everyone else over in the process.\n\nEdited to add a word", "Hopefully the dog is dressed in proper attire. Coat and tie", "Can you phrase it as \"hey, we're thinking about getting a babysitter so that parents can have a nice break during the reception and all the kids will be at X location nearby. Would you want to leave your baby there?\"\n\nIt sounds like the issue is she's self-centered and doesn't do things for other people -- so spin it as something someone's doing for her benefit. I'm sure she wants to party without worrying.", "This makes sense. But. I don\u2019t think OP is worried so much about children- she\u2019s worried about the parents. She stated if Georgie were to take the baby out of the venue if it became fussy, that would be fine- to which Georgie said she would not. So, unfortunately the baby cannot come because Georgie cannot grow up.", "Sounds like there is a better reason than only some kids allows to not invite this person. Weddings are about families, two people becoming a family, joining families, families include children. You are free to make your own choices and by and large I think weddings are the one day you can be a selfish person and make these demands. But they will cause drama. I regret several decisions about my wedding in 2007 but I can\u2019t change them.", "This sounds like he doesnt want to turn her away but shed need to step out if baby cries", "Is MIL the person getting married?", "I will look into the babysitter but it would literally only be for Georgie and baby!\n\nThe other family kids have all got arrangements to go to friends houses after the ceremony as the boozy reception would be terribly boring for them. We didn\u2019t ask for this, but our family members said they would prefer this so they could enjoy the reception and let their hair down. It is only Georgie who insists her baby being there all evening.", "Thank you - it\u2019s good to have that perspective. I definitely don\u2019t want the wedding to be a source of huge tension for the whole family. There is an element of anything concerning Georgie where it can\u2019t be avoided - most dinners with my in laws where she is in attendance end in tears from my MIL. So I guess the key question is do I just bite the bullet and ask for what my fianc\u00e9 and I want, when there is probably going to be drama either way.", "That would be the ideal solution - but as  I said in my post, she isn\u2019t willing to agree to do that \ud83d\ude15"]}
