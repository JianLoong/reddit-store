Keep your dream career and find a man who you can share your wins with.", "NAH just a situation that's beyond the pay grade of the relationship you're in. It's not anyone's fault.\n\nBoth of you clearly love each other but you said he's a boyfriend, not a husband. Neither of you should make this big of a sacrifice for the other without a formal commitment. Either get engaged and pick one person's career to emphasize first (you can switch later-- military couples do this all the time after the career military person retires and the spouse's career becomes primary), or break up.\n\nObviously you don't just jump into a marriage. There could be a long-distance stage like what military couples have during a deployment.\n\nMoving to a different place where there are good opportunities for *you* and a social support system for *you* is one thing, but when it's not there, it will make you dependent on your partner. In a marriage that's reasonable and expected, because each spouse makes sacrifices for the other long-term. But if the union isn't strong and you split up, which is a lot easier as boyfriend and girlfriend, you're a long way from home without resources.\n\nA long-distance move is just as big of a commitment as a marriage. It can be just as expensive to undo if it ends up being a mistake. I notice both of you are just 21. Have you lived together and supported yourselves as a couple? Had a lease together? Taken care of wach other when sick? If either of you don't feel ready to commit to a marriage, you may not be ready for a long-distance move together either.\n\nBack in the day (I'm old) women used to say to each other: \"never move without a ring\". This is what they meant.", "Soft yta because he offered not to go to stay with you but you still agreed to go and are now starting to resent him for it.", "NTA. Do not give up your career so that he can further his.\n\nI'd break up.  Do not quit your dream job and move with him if you do not want to. You will, most likely, end up resenting him for it.", "NTA. Don't move", "What a slimy dude. Emotional blackmail and manipulation so you quit and he takes a job? Dude, you can do so much better! Tell him to FO and enjoy his promotion whilst you build your career!!", "YTA\n\nBreak up if you don\u2019t intend to support the man you\u2019re with.\n\nAnd if you two marry and have children, who is going to carry the brunt of the financial responsibility? He is. So his career matters more than yours.\n\nUnless it doesn\u2019t. Then break up.", "NAH (but borderline E S H). I would not do it. You are very young and this is an important time for your career. I\u2019m borderline E S H because you you agreed to go when you didn\u2019t really want to, and him for getting mad at you for not being enthused when he knows it\u2019s not what you want. He\u2019s also showing you how he feels with his unwillingness to consider long distance. He wants you to make all the sacrifices.\n\nYou will most likely seriously regret it if you move, and the resentment you\u2019ll feel will be poison for what already sounds like a relationship that is on the rocks.", "Exactly, this will only lead to one of you resenting the other. If you move you will in time resent him for having to give up on your career and if you stay he will resent you for taking his promotion away. Since you're young and don't have children. Go your separate ways, if you're meant to be, than you will find each other again.", "No matter what city, one will resent the other.\n\nThey need to let it go.", ">refuses to do long distance\n\nThis is all you need to know about how he feels about you.  Just wants a warm body.\n\nI know it's hard, but to not even try?", "OP said that BF will not take the promotion if she doesn't move with him in the post.\n\nShe felt bad about it and agreed to move but now feels bad about her decision.", "Well said", "This. Exactly this. Incredibly manipulative. \n\nI may be biased because it worked out for me but long distance is clearly the way to go here. my current partner of over 8 years went to grad school 25 hours away from the city we met in and worked together I  and fell for each in. I loved that city and wasn\u2019t able to move right away because of career. We did distance for her first semester so I could job hunt in that city while finishing my current contract and she could get back into \u201cschool mode\u201d since it had been years since her undergrad. I ended up moving without a job lined up and now, 5 years of loving together and 2 career changes for me and 1 for her we are both incredibly happy. We both talk about how that distance actually really helped us fork closer bonds and realize how important our relationship was. Wouldn\u2019t trade it for anything", "This, 99%. I\u2019ve known friends who\u2019ve gone through something like this, and it\u2019s a tough one. \n\nMy only difference is that I vote NAH. You are both faced with the same situation, and it will unfortunately be painful either way.", "I don\u2019t know, it didn\u2019t seem like he was trying to make me feel guilty at the time.", "\u201cWhy can\u2019t he sacrifice his dreams and career for OP\u201d did you just not read the post fully? He said he wouldn\u2019t take the promotion if she didn\u2019t want to move. Meaning he would sacrifice his dreams and career for OP, exactly what you where complaining he wasn\u2019t doing.", "Are you married?", ">And if you two marry and have children, who is going to carry the brunt of the financial responsibility? He is.\n\nWhy would he be the one to \"carry the brunt of the financial responsibility\" ? Maybe she is going to be the main bread winner ! You're projecting...", "Long distance relationships very rarely work. Both have dreams jobs in different cities. This relationship won\u2019t survive that unless one gives up their job. And that leads to other relationship issues. \n\nIf OP had an issue with it, she should have just told bf no. She said yes then changed her mind. Of course he was getting excited. Neither is wrong to want to prioritise dream jobs. \n\nNAH", "oh shit, thanks. My comprehension was not comprehending there.", "I have a feeling he will change his mind if she tells him she is not going.  He is manipulating her and counting on her giving up her job to follow him.  If OP says she is staying behind for a year, and they should see how that year goes, he will go.", "A year or so of long-distance could be great for this couple. The fact he won't consider that is a red flag for me.", "First of all, I think that if you don't want to move, you shouldn't. And if your bf will stay for you because he doesn't want to do long distance relationship then it's his choice, and you shouldn't feel sorry or bad for that chance.\n\nNow, I think that no matter what choice you make, it'll make the situation bad. Still move out ? You'll be sad. Change your mind, once again, and tell him you don't want to move, and it might be too late for him to refuse to promotion.\n\nI know you're young and don't are allowed to make mistakes (both of you), but what you describes are life changing event, these decision shouldn't be taken lightly and especially not disregarding any of your situation. Don't see the problem ? You felt bad about him staying for you, so you agreed to move with him and in the end it made you resent him for something he didn't do and now you're making him feel bad for your own choice.", "He is indeed willing to sacrifice his promotion for the relationship, so although he isn't willing to do long-distance (a hint of marinara) that is what kept me from judging him as an AH.", "No. And no kids", "No. I refuse to make any sacrifices for anyone else regardless of the reasons. I'm my own person, and if someone doesn't accept me exactly as I am, then I have no use for them.", "Because men earn more and can devote more time/focus to their jobs.\n\nWomen insist on raising their children whether they have careers or not \u2014 and at the expense of their careers and children.\n\nThat\u2019s reality.", "I've seen couples survive multiple years apart until they could reunite by visiting each other every 3-4 weeks despite large distances.  But of course it's more common for loneliness and distance to reveal how much of the relationship was about convenience, or for hopelessness of a true reunion to chip away.", "Right.\n\nThen zip it. You are not married and are fundamentally incapable of love. You have nothing of relevance to add.", "That's such nonsense, it's not 1823 anymore. I know plenty of women who are high earners and men who are SATP, not to mention married couples who both have careers and still manage life.", "True. Long distance can work for some people but it doesn\u2019t sound like both partners would be on board here. Couples need to be on the same page relationship wise and that appears to be lacking in this relationship.", "The notion that a person must be married to be capable of love is pretty silly.", "I know people with no legs who can run races. I guess you don\u2019t need legs to run a race.", "That is true. You heard about Paralympics right? Look at those amazing players. \n\nAnd you have such misogynistic and outdated views, you definitely are among those idiots who think women are below them and that men run the world.", "Awwwww, you are adorable."]}
