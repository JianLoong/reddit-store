We have dated now for almost 4 years. Everything was going great until recently while being intimate I asked my boyfriend to not give me hickies on visible areas of my body. Couple of months ago he tried to give me hickies on my neck and I stopped him and it really upset me that i have to tell him everytime we get intimate and that he is trying to coerce me into something I don\u2019t want. He apologized and said he would stop and he seemed really apologetic about it too. After that he didn\u2019t try do it again and everything was okay. \nComing back to the real issue, my boyfriend has a family but CPS put him in foster homes after his mom was a victim of abuse and eventually he was put into foster care and he was fostered by a couple who had other boys in their care who he calls \u201creal family\u201d. He is close with them but they don\u2019t treat him really well. They always talk down on him and sometimes out right physically hit him and pass it off as rough housing. And I would understand if all of them were doing it to each other but he is always the butt of jokes and bullying. My boyfriend thinks it\u2019s okay because that\u2019s how it\u2019s always been but they are grown adults. \nSo, this thanksgiving we decided to invite his foster brothers and host it here at our place. We had a nice dinner but then they started picking on my boyfriend on how is stupid and tried to bully him calling him names. He was visibly uncomfortable so I told them that I didn\u2019t understand how they could talk to eachother like that and I can never understand the fun in being mean to people you love. Then, one of the guy said \u201cWell you have your fun cheating. Atleast we don\u2019t do that\u201d. Then they proceeded to talk about how I wouldn\u2019t let him give me hickies cause I liked flirting with other men and I didn\u2019t want anyone to know that he was my boyfriend and that I was ashamed of being his girlfriend. It\u2019s not true because everyone at work knows I have a boyfriend and I bring him to work events all the time. My boyfriend was telling them to stop and not talk to me like that but none of them cared. They only cared about humiliating me and kept going on. I told them to leave my home at this instant. He said he will talk to them and ask them to apologize. I told him that I never want to see them again. He told me I wouldnt have to and he understands. \nUp until last week, he tells me that he wants to spend Christmas with them. And he would understand If I didn\u2019t want to come along. I told him I wasn\u2019t happy about him spending time with them who have no respect for him or me. He got mad now and is saying that I cannot let one issue affect his life long relationship. So I told him to choose between me or them. I want to know if I am overreacting with this but I feel like I cannot get past this and want to never deal with his brothers again.", "created_utc": 1702528607, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18i0j4h/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriend_to_choose_between/", "score": 132, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Becareful when giving ultimatums \"me or them\", because you might not like the outcome of his choice! Unfortunately, it sounds like he has a lot of learning to do about his own self-worth.  People stay in toxic relationships because of the simple fact that they have known that person for a \"long time.\" It is honestly sad! I cut people off after 20 minutes or 20 years! It does not matter if it is family or not! If it interrupts my mental peace, buh bye! Unfortunately, this is something he has to want! It has absolutely nothing to do with you. Like I said, be careful what you wish for, because it sounds like he will choose them! Goodluck!", "NTA don\u2019t listen to anyone that says you are for asking him to choose.", "Everyone sucks and all of you should look into therapy and setting boundaries for your own self worth.", "YTA. You can absolutely choose not to be apart of your boyfriend\u2019s weird family. But 1, he\u2019s just your boyfriend. And 2, you want him to disown the only family he knows.

This is a really messy situation to be in, and you're NTA for wanting to be respected in your home obviously, but this dude needs some help and as a partner you should always try your best to help and comfort them through anything. \n\nIf this is a guy you see a future with then he needs to understand his worth and value. Otherwise he's going to keep letting these people step all over him, causing further issues. Obviously you're not his therapist so it's not up to you to help him through this, but making him choose will just hurt you both in the long run.", "This is good advice.  I don\u2019t think this is really an issue of you or your Bf being an AH.  But your boyfriend needs help.  And it may not be help you can give him.  You may not have a relationship with him long term.  But if you care for him, treat him like you would a friend.  Explain how his brothers treatment of him is what is really worrying you.  And you want what is best for his mental health.  Encourage him to get help somewhere in learning what healthy and unhealthy relationships look like and how to break the cycle.\n\nTelling him you will not have any relationship with his brothers at all and that you expect him to stop sharing intimate details of your relationship immediately.  But maybe spend a little more time trying to help him. It probably feels wonderful to him to have one person in his corner.", "This is perfect \n\nShe\u2019s an asshole for making him choose. He has obvious abandonment and attachment issues from his childhood trauma and the foster system. \n\nHe can\u2019t choose. \n\nHe is used to keeping his head down and making no waves. \n\nHelp him see his value. \n\nDon\u2019t give him ultimatums like that.", "Um no she\u2019s NTA at all. He needs to make a decision whether he wants her around or not.", "That doesn\u2019t make her an AH at all.

But I want him to just stand up for himself and not be their punching bag. The Christmas thing is especially bothering because we had already made plans to spend it with my family thus thanksgiving with his. I just don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on with him. It\u2019s upsetting that he would let behaviour like this slide from his brothers.

They\u2019ve definitely broken him down and gaslit him into accepting this. \n\nYou can\u2019t undo it with an ultimatum. \n\nHe needs to see his own value and seek help to undo the damage \n\nIt\u2019s highly probable that he\u2019ll choose them because it\u2019s what he knows \n\nYou need to come to him with these concerns and explain how he needs help \n\nIt might help if he has friends that has also observed this behavior so you can show that you\u2019re not the only one who has noticed this behavior \n\nGood luck", "He tells his abusive family you are cheating because you don't want hickies?\n\nHe's got a lot of issues that need therapy.  Lots of it.\n\nHe comes from a home that was so bad he thinks this abuse is 'love'.

It's really not about him but about your boundaries and your decisions for you.", "Eh.. all these comments about being better to him than his family vs giving him an ultimatum are all well and good, except that he\u2019s sharing details about your intimacy that you don\u2019t mention telling him was OK to share. And besides that, it\u2019s not your job to fix broken men, especially to your own detriment. If you want to give him a push in the right direction, maybe suggest therapy, but the rest is up to him.  It doesn\u2019t have to be an ultimatum, but you\u2019re not wrong for choosing to not be involved with the unhealthy dynamics of him and his family.", "As others have said, gentle YTA for the ultimatum. They\u2019re never okay. You are NTA for trying to get your bf to understand he\u2019s being treated like trash. But there are better ways to navigate the situation. Suggest therapy, maybe even couple\u2019s therapy so you two can communicate effectively. \n\nSome problematic things: your bf seemingly either shared or confided in his brothers regarding you not wanting hickeys\u2026which is honestly reasonable because most people, especially if you have a professional job, do not want to walk around with hickeys showing. Now, him sharing/confiding isn\u2019t bad, but he\u2019s obviously choosing to share with people who are not great. I\u2019m wondering if he\u2019s insecure and wondered outloud if you\u2019re cheating or brothers just took his share and ran with it to a completely inappropriate place? \n\nHim not choosing his brothers won\u2019t be an overnight thing, and forcing that decision on him won\u2019t compel him to choose you or all of a sudden make him realize how awful they are. Your boundary to not see them again is 100% reasonable and it seems he is willing to not fight you on that, which is actually good because he acknowledges they fucked up. Is your family in the area? Can he maybe just go there for an hour while you are with family? The couple\u2019s therapy would also help you two to navigate this if you go that route, it may also help with showing him how poorly he\u2019s being treated which may push him in the direction of setting his own boundaries.\n\nOr, this is something you don\u2019t feel equipped to deal with and you break up. His family has disrespected you, you are hurt, and it\u2019s likely not the type of relationship you want with your partner\u2019s family. That\u2019s also okay. But giving an ultimatum is not. \n\nGood luck!", "YTA anytime you have to give an ultimatum you are the ass. Your boyfriend is clearly not ready to be rid of his toxic family and you have 2 choices. Continue to support and encourage him to not put up with it or leave. You have no right to make him choose because you don't like your options.\n\n\nAlso I think its weird you are upset his going to see his family (that you said you don't want to be around anymore) without you. You were fine up until you realized he wasn't cutting them out his life only your (which you asked him to do).", "YTA.  I\u2019d break up with you for making the ultimatum.  He\u2019s an adult.  You can make your boundaries, but not his.  As soon as someone says me or them, I don\u2019t make the choice they want.  Simply because I will never allow another human being to control me like that.  Asking anyone to leave their family, regardless of the situation is done in a support position, not a bully position - which is what you are doing.  Just like his brothers. I think the guy has had enough of that.", "YTA  - Asking him to abandon his family if he wants you to stay is emotional abuse. So you're also bullying him.", "Its sad you made him choose and if your so insecure let him go alone like what is the problem with them saying your cheating if your not you have nothing to get mad about YTA", "Listen, unfortunately , giving an ultimatum is always a YTA move. So that is my verdict, on a technicality.\n\nBut you are right. You shouldn't be exposed to this. The thing is, him accepting this abuse and refusing to let go of his abusers, despite you pointing out time and time again, is putting you in the position of constantly having to take on the role of his emotional caretaker. \n\nHe is drowning, and you keep trying to pull him out, but unfortunately he is pulling you down with him. \n\nHe's already involving you with them by breaking your trust and sharing intimate details with them. And then not doing anything of value to protect you when they came like bloodthirsty hounds after your throat. He exposed you to their abuse, and let it happen. You had to throw them out, when it should have been him.\n\nI'd have this conversation once again with him. Without ultimatums. Apologise for making him chose. Tell him that this isn't his choice to make, but yours. And you can't deal with this - this isn't getting better, and if you were to see a future with him, with kids, with a family, you would not want this family to be exposed to abusers he refuses to lower contact with. \n\nAsk him one last time to go to therapy, to work through these issues, to have someone help him get his head above water. Because he's pulling you down and you don't want to drown.\n\nIf he can't stop pulling you down with him, this relationship needs to end.", "ESH honestly this is too messy and I'd probably just leave. They're his family and will likely be in his life forever. They don't respect you and he doesn't care, so just move on. You can't force someone to choose between yourself and their family because they will not choose you.", "YTA, but only for the ultimatum. Sure you can look out for him, try to show and tell him what he is going through isn't normal or healthy, but he has to make that choice, and if you force it on him, he will resent you forever. That is still his family and he need professional help to heal from all his trauma.", "Gentle YTA. Never meet them again, and neither should he. BUT he needs therapy, not an ultimatum.", "Nta  they accused you of cheating on him and he seems to be fine with that.", "Don't give harsh ultimatums. YTA", "I think you need to go your own way. It\u2019s never a good thing to have to offer an ultimatum for any future events. It sounds like he\u2019s ok with being the butt of their jokes. Plus- He obviously shares your intimate details with them- if that\u2019s ok, good luck. You need to take care of yourself and that includes evaluating your current relationship. Your Not The Ass!", "Bingo, this should probably go on r/relationship_advice", "This. And she's a bit dense if she doesnt connect how his history of abandonment and trauma makes him still cling to relationships with people who mistreat him. This very may well be the only and first form of \"love\" he's ever known. These are deeper issues that cant be resolved with an ultimatum and for someone who care about, you should owe him a bit more compassion.", "You are right about most things. My boyfriend is very levelheaded most of the times. I try my best to understand where he is coming from. He understands where I am coming from. He agrees that they were out of line in saying those things. Infact he even agrees that they bully him. However, he makes excuses for all their behaviors saying things like they haven\u2019t had the best past or that they only have each other. There have been less than ideal incidents with them over the years but it was always regarding my boyfriend. Them is disrespecting me is where I draw the line. I am not being complicit in their actions.I sort of get that it is wrong of me to give him ultimatum but I also feel like it was necessary for me to be in a relationship. \nIn couple of days I will suggest us for couples therapy. He has refused to go to counseling by himself before. I hope he tries this time for our sake.", "We had a pre-planned Christmas with my family. He is just abandoning it. I would have been fine if he wanted to spend it with them if thanksgiving incident had not happened. But it just feels like him going to them Christmas just gives them a message they can disrespect me again. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t overthink it but that\u2019s why I posted it here to sort out my thoughts and see where I stand.", "You don\u2019t think I should get mad about being falsely accused of infidelity. It boiled my blood cause they were questioning my character. I hope you stand up for your SO or yourself if it ever happens to you.", "So many red flags. The boyfriend \"forgetting\" your boundaries, the  sharing of your intimacy, the disgusting implying of you being a cheater, bullying and disrespect at your home, the boyfriend codependent on his bullies. And the sharing of intimacy! I say this again because it is just so wrong.  \n\nAlso, the guy has way too many issues. He should address them with therapy before engaging in a  relationship. You have an ultimatum because you want too be chosen. But ask yourself: should you be choosing him?", "Did they \"take it that way\" or did he sell it that way? \n\nThat's a pretty big leap that no hickies = cheating. I don't necessarily think they came to that conclusion entirely on their own. He may have just been trying to bond and \"bro\" it up with them, but to me, an outsider , it seems either he planted that seed in their mind or at the very least didnt stand firm enough to get them to stop. You had to throw them out why didn't he help with that?", "Just to be clear, if you don't intend to separate him from them, what even was the ultimatum about? If you told him to choose between them and you, that does sound like you are saying he shouldn't see them. Perhaps it would be more productive to have a longer talk with him about the actual issues here. Explain that if you both already made a commitment to spend time with your family on Christmas, it's only fair to uphold that. In a reverse scenario, he wouldn't want to cancel on *his* family I assume. Encourage him to see his own worth, and maybe try to put the behavior of his foster brothers in perspective, like what if someone else was behaving that way towards *you*? Encourage him to speak to a therapist. You're not overreacting but if you care about him and want to help him through this (as opposed to just leaving, which is also entirely valid of course), make sure you're not accidentally pushing him to choose them over you. Work with him, ultimatums usually don't help.", "Let's go full circle here. Why does he have to make that decision? Because he has a girlfriend that can't empathize or understand that he had a traumatic upbringing and has weird relationship issues. She is forcing his hand to abandon what he thinks of as the people who care about him, or threatens to leave if he wants to maintain his relationships.\n\nI fully understand her boundary in not dealing with the for sure, but ya have a weird take on this one.", "Giving ultimatums isn\u2019t a boundary. Saying, \u201cI do not want to see them again because they are disrespectful,\u201d is a boundary. And almost always, someone giving an ultimatum is the asshole. Usually ultimatums come after some high stress, high emotion circumstance, where putting that type of choice on someone is almost always unfair. There are better ways to navigate this ordeal other than making him choose between his shitty brothers and her at the drop of a hat.", "While she has the right to a boundary for her, her making him choose when he doesn\u2019t even see the true issue makes her TA. You can still be TA for boundaries, especially if they are only seen as a boundary for ones self and the other is clueless on as to why. \u201cMy way or the highway\u201d is indeed manipulative as well and also causes more abandonment issues, thus pushing one to go back to old faithful even though it may be toxic.\nIf you \u201clove\u201d someone and want to spend your life with them then you also need to help your partner grow and understand how their relationship with others affects you and also them.", "\"I told him I don't want to see them again and he told me I wouldn't have to and he understands.\"\n\nThis is her boundary. She stated it. Then, she told us he accepted it. \n\n\"I don't want you to see them either\" is not HER boundary. Boundaries are things we set for ourselves, we cannot dictate someone else's boundary. We can suggest, \"I don't think you should see them either because they treat you poorly,\" but we cannot force them to do something. At best she's misguided in her execution of this. But she came to AITA, not r/relationshipadvice so we give out the verdict with the options we have.", ">she\u2019s not his therapist \n\nSometimes, when you love someone, and can see that they\u2019re really struggling, you exercise empathy and encourage them to get the help they need. A lot people need encouragement from those around them to actually GET therapy. She\u2019s not OBLIGATED to do that, but she has expressed concern for him and a desire for him to have healthier boundaries. People here are advising her on ways to do that. People are also correct that there\u2019s a big difference between boundaries and setting ultimatums like OP\u2019s.", "I totally get it. My husband makes a lot of excuses for my MIL who has very problematic behaviors. It\u2019s hard. Hopefully he agrees to couples therapy, I think it would be beneficial. I\u2019m sure he just feels bound to them because of not just their past, but his as well. And that\u2019s understandable, but no one should tolerate being bullied just because they both share the experience of a bad childhood. Good luck!!", "I could be wrong but I think you may be overthinking it. Him going without you shows them you wont tolerate their disrespect. So does the fact they probably aren't allowed in you home anymore.\n\nTalk to him about why he decided to change Christmas plans. And also let him know about your fear of their continual disrespect. But honestly I'm not sure how well this will go in the future. If y'all get married he's going to want them there and he's not going to be able to control them. If you have kids they may want to act like uncles and show up to stuff. What if he wants to take the kid to their home for holidays or something. They could talk bad about you and your SO in front of your kids. Long haul if you never forgive them, they never change, and your boyfriend never lets them go could you be happy?", "You can stand up for your SO yes, and you should. You cannot make demanda over who they can and cannot see. You can have YOUR boundary at never seeing them again. He does not have to share that same boundary.", "Ultimatums are really \"asshole unless proven otherwise\" kind of thing", "Yes, I want to know where the idea of cheating comes from.", "I don\u2019t get that either. The whole issues with hickies was he used to give them to me in college and I never stopped him but just covered with it makeup sometimes and sometimes just didn\u2019t care. But with time I started to find it extremely annoying to cover up especially if I had work. I had told him not to do it but sometimes he would still do it until that night where I told him it\u2019s off the table. I tried talking to him he said they got the wrong idea. I have no clue what he said and what they understood. But we were avoiding thanksgiving incident with minimal discussion because he seemed to agree with me and supported me until he brought Christmas back up.", "I mean, if she\u2019s an AH then it\u2019s ESH. Yes boyfriend clearly has severe trauma BUT that isn\u2019t carte blanche to stand by and watch them treat her poorly with intimate details of their lives that he had NO business sharing with them. Trauma is an explanation but it is not an excuse. OP is going about this the wrong way and giving the wrong ultimatums.", "Like how can I better navigate this? It\u2019s been some days since we had that conversation and we haven\u2019t really done much talking after it than casual roommate talk. I didn\u2019t give him an ultimatum to never talk to them. I understand why post might seem this way cause I edited it removing many sentences for the word count. The ultimatum was more like where is he going to spend his Christmas this year which he has been spending with my family for past two years. His brothers never invited him for Christmas before this as far as I know. I think if he chooses them I am going to rethink this relationship if he is not willing to work on it. But I want to give it my best too because he is my bestfriend and I love him.", "You are wrong. He is not clueless. He very much knows and accepts why I want this. He makes excuses for their behavior or thinks it\u2019s okay to do these things cause they don\u2019t know any better. We have been building our lives together so for so long and been each other\u2019s rock. He is not just my boyfriend but also my best friend. I love him alot. The ultimatum was just for Christmas and I wasn\u2019t telling him he could never talk to them. I am pretty sure he can easily tell them that he won\u2019t be able to make it this year after all that\u2019s happened. I don\u2019t intend to be manipulative. If anything I am trying not to be. I am just thinking him going over there might give them more power. He already had pre planned Christmas plans with my family anyway which we have been doing past two years.", "Omg this made me sob because this is exactly my fear. I just didn\u2019t know how to put it into words. We are planning wedding next year and possibly kids. I don\u2019t know if I want this kind of influence on them. I especially don\u2019t want my kids to see their father being treated this way. I feel like it would hurt my soul. I have never brought it up with him because his childhood is a sore topic for him and rightfully so. I do agree he needs to sort his issues but I don\u2019t want to hold that against him either. Or that he needs to hide his past but i cannot see how I would deal with such issues when it might arrive and it looks evident from what I have seen so far.", "It sounds like he\u2019s on high alert for potential conflict with these people after the blowup at Thanksgiving. He\u2019s hoping he can use Christmas to smooth things over with them.", "\"my boyfriend was telling them to stop\"\n\n\"He said he will talk to them\"\n\nAlso confirms gf doesn't have to spend time with them. \nBf didn't \"stand by\", how did you get to that conclusion?", "So i saw in other comments that him going feels as if he is choosing their side, it makes you feel like he thinks it\u2019s okay. Especially because he typically goes to your family\u2019s house on Christmas. Tell him that. That\u2019s literally where you start. If he insists on going to see his brothers, suggest that he maybe only goes there for a short time then joins you with your family and see where that goes. You can also revisit the conversation you last had, \u201chey, i feel like we haven\u2019t further discussed what happened outside of that night and i really want to move forward but to do so I think some things need to be talked about\u2026\u201d You can gently suggest therapy for him or couple\u2019s therapy to help work through these things, there\u2019s nothing wrong with doing that, it means nothing bad about the two of you or your relationship. \n\nAnd if him wanting to go is making you re-think the relationship, that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s his baggage and it has spilled into your life in a very negative way. That\u2019s reasonable. You just have to be open and honest about that.", "This is a major issue that needs to be dealt with before you put down any deposits and especially before you bring kids into it. Tell him you are struggling with these things and would like for you both to do couples and independent counseling before moving forward with the wedding planning. He needs individual to help him gain self worth and perspective in this situation and you should offer to go to individual so he doesn't feel alone or like the problem. It may also help you figure out a way to not only navigate these situations but also communicate them with him. \n\nIf you have to write how you feel about the air and book a couple's counseling session where you can read it to him and a safe place. Your boyfriend seems understanding of your wants and needs so don't be afraid to talk about them.", "You are an empathetic person who doesn't know what else to do to support your bf. The ultimatum is a sign you're at your breaking point, and I'm sure it's not something you really want to do. That's clear in your posts. But there comes a time when you need to put yourself first for your own well-being, as well think towards the future. Is he capable of overcoming his codependency? Because unless his brothers change he's going to continue his self-abuse which will affect you and any future plans you make. Think long and hard together, whether you could marry and raise children with such toxic elements in your lives.", "Thank you. I will try bringing up therapy with him. I hope he says yes for our sake.", "That commenter had solid advice. I think the way you open your conversation is simple. Tell him you know it wasn't right to give him the ultimatum, but you were upset, and you're getting to the end of your rope with their treatment of him and you.\n\nThen, you need to have a heartfelt conversation. You tell him just what you told us. You think he deserves to be treated better, it hurts you to see him treated this way, it hurts that he cant see how they treat him isnt right. From what you said it sounds like he already respected your decision to not be with them and defended you when they tried to treat you the way he gets treated, which is great. You might even to be able to put him in the right mindset by saying \"did you like how they were treating me? No? Then, why is it okay for them to treat you that way? It's very difficult for me to see.\" If he's receptive to that then you can gently suggest therapy for himself or as a couple.\n\nAs far as the immediate question of Christmas, I saw a suggestion of him spending time with his family for a little then coming with you. That'd be the best compromise because I don't think you're going to be able to stop him from going for at least a little. If he opts not to come with you, then you have to accept that and start planning for the therapy path."]}
