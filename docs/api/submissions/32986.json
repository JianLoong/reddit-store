We have dated now for almost 4 years. Everything was going great until recently while being intimate I asked my boyfriend to not give me hickies on visible areas of my body. Couple of months ago he tried to give me hickies on my neck and I stopped him and it really upset me that i have to tell him everytime we get intimate and that he is trying to coerce me into something I don\u2019t want. He apologized and said he would stop and he seemed really apologetic about it too. After that he didn\u2019t try do it again and everything was okay. \nComing back to the real issue, my boyfriend has a family but CPS put him in foster homes after his mom was a victim of abuse and eventually he was put into foster care and he was fostered by a couple who had other boys in their care who he calls \u201creal family\u201d. He is close with them but they don\u2019t treat him really well. They always talk down on him and sometimes out right physically hit him and pass it off as rough housing. And I would understand if all of them were doing it to each other but he is always the butt of jokes and bullying. My boyfriend thinks it\u2019s okay because that\u2019s how it\u2019s always been but they are grown adults. \nSo, this thanksgiving we decided to invite his foster brothers and host it here at our place. We had a nice dinner but then they started picking on my boyfriend on how is stupid and tried to bully him calling him names. He was visibly uncomfortable so I told them that I didn\u2019t understand how they could talk to eachother like that and I can never understand the fun in being mean to people you love. Then, one of the guy said \u201cWell you have your fun cheating. Atleast we don\u2019t do that\u201d. Then they proceeded to talk about how I wouldn\u2019t let him give me hickies cause I liked flirting with other men and I didn\u2019t want anyone to know that he was my boyfriend and that I was ashamed of being his girlfriend. It\u2019s not true because everyone at work knows I have a boyfriend and I bring him to work events all the time. My boyfriend was telling them to stop and not talk to me like that but none of them cared. They only cared about humiliating me and kept going on. I told them to leave my home at this instant. He said he will talk to them and ask them to apologize. I told him that I never want to see them again. He told me I wouldnt have to and he understands. \nUp until last week, he tells me that he wants to spend Christmas with them. And he would understand If I didn\u2019t want to come along. I told him I wasn\u2019t happy about him spending time with them who have no respect for him or me. He got mad now and is saying that I cannot let one issue affect his life long relationship. So I told him to choose between me or them. I want to know if I am overreacting with this but I feel like I cannot get past this and want to never deal with his brothers again.", "created_utc": 1702528607, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18i0j4h/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriend_to_choose_between/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You obviously don't have to put up with these people.  But your bf clearly does not understand his own value, and that these people are not his family or his friends.  So have some empathy.  Don't treat this as being about you or an \"it's them or me\".  Set your own boundary (I will not be treated like that).  And talk to him about how what they're doing is wrong and he's worth more than that.  This may not work out for the two of you.  But at least for once in his life, someone will show him the value every human deserves and that he has never gotten in his life.", "NTA.  Desperation usually leads to desperate measures.  But, if the outcome isn't pleasing to you ... you must move on.", "Here's the problem with your ultimatum - it's only going to make him choose them.\n\nDude needs therapy. They all do. And if you bf grew up witnessing abuse, he probably doesn't quite realize that his other family is abusing him too. \n\nGentle YTA - I understand where you're coming from, but in the long run it helps no one.", "NTA for caring enough about your boyfriend to not want to see him get treated poorly. NTA for not wanted to be bullied by his \"family\". But YTA for the ultimatum.\n\nHe obviously had a very tough childhood and due to that probably doesn't have the ability to create/maintain healthy boundaries, nor does he understand his own worth. That's something he needs to explore in therapy. Problem is, you can't force someone to try to address their trauma or deal with it on your timeline.  The fact that you are makes you the AH. \n\nIn this moment, if this is the guy for you, you need to sit him down and tell him why you feel strongly about what happened (how they treat him, as well as what they said about you), then set the boundary that you want for yourself. If he can't respect your boundary, then it may be time to part ways. If he respects it, then that's all you can ask of him. He has to make the decision on his own (with hopefully your support when he's ready) to set boundaries with his family.", "Uhm, he told something private you said during sex to his brothers? Did that part slip your mind? What else has he told them? Aside from him letting his brothers abuse him, they were verbally abusing you and they didn\u2019t listen to him when he told them to stop. In his own home. And now he wants to spend Christmas with them\u2026. NTA, but don\u2019t be surprised if the boy with the rubber spine chooses them.", "What BF needs is therapy so he can set his own boundaries and understand what is and isn't loving behavior. He doesn't have proper examples in his life to refer to. \n\nHe doesn't need his GF issuing ultimatums, \"Them or Me!\"\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYou don't need to be in contact with his family, but you also don't have any right to tell him to choose between you or them. Trust me, this will not end well for you. Even if he does choose you, in time, he will resent you and sneak behind your back and see his family, or he will just choose his family over you.", "He will choose them and you know it.\n\n Since you've been with him for a long time, it's up to you if you wanna live with this in the future as well. Ask him to get help and draw boundaries, if he doesn't, leave. His issues and reluctance to get help shouldn't be your problem. \n\nIf someone else he's close with one day comes up and starts insulting you, he'd just let it happen wouldn't he?\nNAH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Becareful when giving ultimatums \"me or them\", because you might not like the outcome of his choice! Unfortunately, it sounds like he has a lot of learning to do about his own self-worth.  People stay in toxic relationships because of the simple fact that they have known that person for a \"long time.\" It is honestly sad! I cut people off after 20 minutes or 20 years! It does not matter if it is family or not! If it interrupts my mental peace, buh bye! Unfortunately, this is something he has to want! It has absolutely nothing to do with you. Like I said, be careful what you wish for, because it sounds like he will choose them! Goodluck!", "NTA don\u2019t listen to anyone that says you are for asking him to choose.", "Everyone sucks and all of you should look into therapy and setting boundaries for your own self worth.", "YTA. You can absolutely choose not to be apart of your boyfriend\u2019s weird family. But 1, he\u2019s just your boyfriend. And 2, you want him to disown the only family he knows. You\u2019re going to have to learn to be without him for holidays until HE\u2019S ready to cut them off, as that is not your decision to make.", "YTA, but not by a lot.\n\nUltimatums usually never work out and can cause a rift in relationships. This is a really messy situation to be in, and you're NTA for wanting to be respected in your home obviously, but this dude needs some help and as a partner you should always try your best to help and comfort them through anything. \n\nIf this is a guy you see a future with then he needs to understand his worth and value. Otherwise he's going to keep letting these people step all over him, causing further issues. Obviously you're not his therapist so it's not up to you to help him through this, but making him choose will just hurt you both in the long run.", "This is good advice.  I don\u2019t think this is really an issue of you or your Bf being an AH.  But your boyfriend needs help.  And it may not be help you can give him.  You may not have a relationship with him long term.  But if you care for him, treat him like you would a friend.  Explain how his brothers treatment of him is what is really worrying you.  And you want what is best for his mental health.  Encourage him to get help somewhere in learning what healthy and unhealthy relationships look like and how to break the cycle.\n\nTelling him you will not have any relationship with his brothers at all and that you expect him to stop sharing intimate details of your relationship immediately.  But maybe spend a little more time trying to help him. It probably feels wonderful to him to have one person in his corner.", "This is perfect \n\nShe\u2019s an asshole for making him choose. He has obvious abandonment and attachment issues from his childhood trauma and the foster system. \n\nHe can\u2019t choose. \n\nHe is used to keeping his head down and making no waves. \n\nHelp him see his value. \n\nDon\u2019t give him ultimatums like that.", "Um no she\u2019s NTA at all. He needs to make a decision whether he wants her around or not.", "That doesn\u2019t make her an AH at all. She\u2019s setting a boundary with him and telling him he needs to decide how he wants to be treated. She\u2019s not his therapist. Why so many people here think setting a boundary makes someone an AH I\u2019ll never understand", "I think he is scared of them. They are mean bullies atleast to him. I honestly get the history they have and how he might feel like that\u2019s the only family he has besides me. I don\u2019t intend to separate him from them either. But I want him to just stand up for himself and not be their punching bag. The Christmas thing is especially bothering because we had already made plans to spend it with my family thus thanksgiving with his. I just don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on with him. It\u2019s upsetting that he would let behaviour like this slide from his brothers. But I also feel like it\u2019s not fair for me to put him in a position where I punish him for something an outsider said.", "I did write about it in my original post about him discussing intimate details bothered me but i deleted that part cause it would only let me post 3000 characters. He basically said that it just came up once when they were talking about it. He never thought they would take it that way.", "Yes he needs therapy but that's not OP's problem. She should be there to support him, yes. But she doesn't have to tolerate disrespect from people her boyfriend can't draw boundaries with.", "Um NTA she\u2019s not his therapist nor does she need to enable his self destructive tendencies. Honestly she should just leave if he can\u2019t kick these people to the curb", "Well I couldn\u2019t write it in the post cause of word count but the holiday plans were already pre-planned how we would celebrate thanksgiving with them and Christmas with my family. And if that incident didn\u2019t happen I would understand him wanting to spend time with his brothers as they are christians and we arent so my family doesn\u2019t really celebrate Christmas it\u2019s more like fun get together. (Side note: he has been spending Christmas with my family for past two years because they have never invited him) But now it just feels like he is going there cause he is taking their side instead of mine. Thus the ultimatum.", "She\u2019s NTA at all. Not even a little."]}
