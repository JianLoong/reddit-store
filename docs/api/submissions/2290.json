She lived in the same neighbourhood and went to the same school as my son \"Sam\" (27m), where they became friends. They have been together for about 6 years and married for 2. Leylah is currently 6 months pregnant with my first grandchild. \n\nAt some point in her life Leylah had a traumatic experience involving food, which caused her to eat only 3-4 things for a long time and she was diagnosed with eating disorder. With Sam she managed to expand her menu and is less scared to try new things. Normally when Leylah tries a new food and likes it Sam makes sure to celebrate it.\n\nWe had a pre thanksgiving dinner this weekend as Leylah and Sam were planning to have a small holiday with Leylah's aunty in Greece. We get talking and I have asked how they are doing and if they have any news, hoping they will share something about my grandchild. Instead Leylah started talking how she tried onion for the first time in years in that very nice Greek restaurant and how much she enjoyed the taste. I have stopped her half way there and said I don't think that trying an onion is an achievement and wanted to hear how my grandchild is doing and if they know the gender yet.\n\nLeylah got really quiet and Sam told me and my husband they will be leaving. I have asked what is wrong and Sam had a go at me saying I am being a massive asshole for not caring about Leylah and her happiness, for putting her down and making her feel like an incubator for my grand babies and to her eating a new food is an achievement due to extremely traumatic past. He also said he is not sure if he wants to let me to have access to my grandchild due to how I have treated the future mother. After both of them left.\n\nMy husband agrees with me and doesn't see what I did wrong, but the rest of my kids are furious with me and told me I should have my mouth shut.", "created_utc": 1668416079, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yutbeg/aita_for_telling_my_dil_that_eating_an_onion_is/", "score": 1607, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You spend a lot of time explaining why, for leylah, eating an onion is in fact a huge achievement and then you dismiss it? Your son is right, you are treating her like an incubator and I wouldn't be surprised if they go LC or NC. Have some compassion.", "Why do I feel like this isn't the first time you've treated her this way? YTA", "Of course YTA. You could have said, \"That's great! I'm so glad you're overcoming your previous issues. And how is the pregnancy going?\" You could even then ask if they know the gender yet. You are, in fact, treating her as an incubator.\n\nIf you don't know the difference, you're probably a narcissistic AH in everything you do. This is a human being in front of you--one you've known for 20 years(!) and should have some feeling for. She's pregnant with *her* or *their* first child. That child is also your grandchild, but do you understand that other people matter too? At least pretend, or you can expect to have no relationship with that grandchild or any others.", "YTA Leylah is not pregnant with your grandchild she is pregnant with her child. The fact that you gatekeep what people consider 'news' is very telling about who you are as a person. If you wanted to know about LEYLAHS child, you should have been more direct in the first place. Instead, you keep claiming this kid as your grandchild. Instead of celebrating Leylah who choose too spend time with you, you demeaned Leylahs existence. She has a life beyond what is going on in her uterus.. If you do not want to hear about her 'news' maybe just do not ask in the first place. Or instead. Be up front and ask directly, that way they can see how messed up your priorities are.", "Eating an onion might not be an achievement but ***fucking overcoming trauma*** definitely is. YTA. Also you should know, you're probably not going to be allowed to be around your previous grandchild at this rate, so good luck with that.", "YTA- she is struggling with an eating disorder and was making progress you essentially said you don't give a flying F about how she is doing as a person or the progress she is making.. ED's kill people you should be proud of her for trying her best. you are TA", "YTA.\n\nYou asked how they were and if they had any news. You didn't specify that you were asking specifically regarding the grandkid. Then when she did tell you how she was and sharing her news (she can now eat onions) you cut her off. Rude.\n\nIf you want her to talk about the grandkid, then ask about the grandkid. Don't ask a broad question and then cut off the person if they didn't answer the way you hoped they would.\n\nAnd you couldn't just listen to her for a few minutes and then ask specifically about the grandkid? What's the rush to hear about the grandkid that you couldn't spare a few minutes to hear how your DIL is doing? \n\nIf this is because you have no interest about the food she eats, you didn't even have to listen to her. You could have just nodded your head until she was finished with her news and then ask about the grandkid. Feign interest at least. Why rain on her parade by not even letting her share her news?", "YTA but major kudos to your son for standing up to you!  I bet Leylah is super proud to have such an amazing and caring husband.", "Yta\n\nYes normally eating a onion is not a big deal, BUT taken into context obviously on this case it is.  You know the background why you couldn't just listen and nod you are TA for this. \n\nAnd I'm sure they have listened to much from you that doesn't interest them without resorting to rudeness. \n\nAnd please show interest in your son and daughter as people not grandchild producers.   You will gain much and avoid losing more.", "Yta, remember she has issues with food, so for her it was a achievement. Don\u2019t be so dismissive of others just because you don\u2019t agree.", "YTA. Yes you are. And i think you know that already but wanted people on here to back you up instead. \n\nWhy is it so difficult for you to be a decent person or simply just keep your big mouth shut? She wasnt doing anything to personally annoy you. Eating disorders are one of the hardest things to work through.", "YTA - she\u2019s struggling with an ED, it might not be an achievement to you but it is for her, she\u2019s obviously trying very hard and it\u2019s obviously a struggle for her so why diminish it ?? comments like that can have such a huge effect on peoples ed and set them back. surely you could have waited a couple minutes ? not even ? all you had to do was say a couple of encouraging words and then the conversation could have moved on ?", "YTA With her trauma that prevents her from eating new foods? Yes, it is a massive achievement because the achievement is that she is overcoming trauma. \n\nLearn some basic empathy, there is no excuse for the lack of it at your age. She's a human being struggling with trauma, not an incubator.", "YTA. So from now on, all she can talk about ever is your grandchild? You should applaud her for every new hurdle she overcomes regarding her eating disorder, since a healthy mindset - and diversification in food preference no doubt will have a positive effect on your future grandchild.", "A huge YTA. ED's aren't about being childish, it's about being sick, especially mentally. So yes, overcoming your illness, fears and traumas are indeed an achievement.\n\n Imagine if it was a person who got their both legs ran over by a truck, then having to heal, go to therapy, use a wheelchair, overcome pain. And then bam! They managed to take their first step after the accident. Isn't it an achievement? Would you say something like \"Walking with your legs isn't an achievement, you know?\"? Because technically, most people walk with their legs, it's not an achievement if we're taking it globally. But for this certain person it IS an achievement, because they couldn't walk before, and now they managed to get strong and healed enough for that.", "This can't be real \nI'm having difficulty believing that someone who wrote this is that oblivious..", "YTA, an achievement is an achievement. You lack empathy for your daughter in-law over her food related trauma.", "YTA majorly , she's trying to tell you how she's doing an all you care about is YOUR grand baby , how have you gotten to 53 yrs old with this rude attitude.", "YTA you completely disregarded her illness and the fact that she's trying to expand her diet for the sake of your grandchild she's creating. Read up on earrings disorders and maybe you can understand empathy for her situation.", "What were you trying to accomplish when you insulted her? How did you think that would play out? What a stupid thing to do to someone. She trusted you enough to share her problem with you and then celebrate progress with you. You spit in her face. You owe her a huge apology. I can;t believe you did that.", "You could have heard her out, and then later asked for an update on the baby. But nah\u2014you couldn\u2019t be bothered to hear what she had to say. You didn\u2019t care about her, and you made that very clear. \n\nIf you wanted to hear about the baby, you should have asked directly about the baby. Not make a vague ask for news, and then cutting her off when you don\u2019t hear what you wanted. \n\nThat\u2019s just rude. \n\nYTA", "YTA love how you\u2019re harping on about her achievements being a sign of \u201cbad parenting\u201d when there\u2019s only one person here whos kids have all told her she was in the wrong and a huge AH! maybe some self reflection on how you are as a person will go a long way before you start making bull shit comments like this to that poor woman. i wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you don\u2019t have a relationship with your grandchild, because before you she is their MOTHER. have some respect", "YTA\u2026 I have a type of restrictive food intake disorder and can tell you from experience that it absolutely is a big achievement if someone with food trauma tries a new food AND enjoys it.", "Of course YTA. You and your husband are not going to see that grandchild as much as you were thinking.", "YTA. eating an onion was a milestone in healing from her trauma, of course it\u2019s important. \n\nAnd the baby is primarily their child, not your grandchild.", "YTA. I didn't even get to the second half of the post and already knew where this was going. I also noticed that this is YOUR grandchild. I could almost hear the emphasis. Then i got to the third paragraph.. Oh boy. You certainly are the AH. Can't even believe you would ask that. You come across rude and entitled. If you don't want to hear about your DIL and her life she is entitled to exclude you from it. Did you thought of that? Or did yoiu forget that there is an actual person carying YOUR grandchild? \n\nYou were rude and made an unnecessary mess. For some reason you don't even see it. I propose you think about it. Good luck.\n\nBy the end of the post i was glad to see Sam stick up for his wife and set boundaries with you.", "YTA\n\nSo many people perfectly explaining to you why Y T A. No doubts for anyone but you.\n\nI wonder why you even thought of asking this in AITA.", "YTA \n\nYour son is right. You see your DIL\u2019s only value as an incubator. \n\nThis was a big deal to HER. This was something she was excited about. \n\nAnd you dismissed her. And moved immediately onto your grandchild. As if you have any right to know the gender or anything else until it\u2019s offered to you voluntarily. \n\nWell done", "YTA she has an eating disorder so thats not a small thing so eating a new food IS a big deal. This sounds like ARFID which is pretty serious. I understand you want to hear about your grandchild but you completely invalidated her and dont sound supportive. Research ARFID and other EDs and get some education.", "YTA. Her finally being able to try/eat onion again is a huge deal!!! It's a great accomplishment in her recovery from an ED. And I'm so glad your son is so supportive of Leylah!!\n\nYou should be supportive as well. Maybe she was gonna share ab the grandchild after these news?! You were really rude to interrupt her and dismiss her like that. Glad your son stood up for her.\n\nYour son is right it doesnt sound like you really care ab Leylah and her well being at all, only the unborn baby. Thats not what a MIL should be like. Do better.", "YTA\n\nLet\u2019s be clear here. You think of her only as an incubator but for some reason it doesn\u2019t cross your mind that maybe just maybe she is trying her hardest to push her limits so that she can provide more nutrition for her child? How hard it would have been to over come this trauma only to be dismissed and treated like a second class citizen with her own damn body. \n\nI would bet my house on it that isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve done shitty thing which is why no one wants to be around you. \n\nIn a comment you say something about bad parenting. You are not a role model for good parenting. You don\u2019t get to judge her. \n\nGod I hope they see this and know they should go no contact with you.", "Yeah YTA lady. \n\nWhat part of trauma do you not understand? You think she wants to have this eating disorder? You think recovering from it is a laugh? Do you think it's easy to deal with? \n\nRecovery is a huge achievement, every time she tries a new food, she is one step further away from her trauma. But then you come along, shit all over her progress, make it blatantly obvious that all you care about is grandchildren, and then act shocked when your son tells you off for being callous and disrespectful. \n\nGet your act together and have some fucking compassion. Jeez.", "YTA just for this isolated incident alone. But ask yourself is this really is the whole reason why your kids are furious with you to the point where they consider you not fit to be around their children. I'm betting there's a lot more to unpack here. If you really want to be in your grandchild's life I suggest you take your kids seriously amd start reconsidering how you interact with them.", "How are people who are this much of a cartoon villain AH not aware of it?", "YTA\nIf you care about your grandchild...Please, educate yourself about eating disorders and trauma.", "YTA \n\nOne, you were dismissive of something that was indeed a huge achievement for her.\n\nTwo, you asked about the pregnancy and she deflected, she clearly didn\u2019t want to talk about it. Maybe they had some news that they\u2019re not ready to talk about, or maybe being pregnant is causing her anxiety and she wanted to change the subject.\n\nEither way, stop viewing her as the incubator for your grandkid, she\u2019s a whole person and if you\u2019re not nice to her then you can kiss that side of your family goodbye.", "YTA You know she had a trauma related eating disorder and you still can\u2019t see what you said is wrong. You lack empathy. I understand very well why they don\u2019t want to risk letting you near their future kid. \n\nHave you been diagnosed by any change? Not that it is an excuse in any way but it might be beneficial to get help to have social interactions in a more socially acceptable way.", "Yta\nIf you ask for \"any news\", and people don't talk about what you wanted them to, you should learn to communicate better", "YTA already just for saying \"she's pregnant with MY GRANDCHILD\". She's not an incubator. She's pregnant with her child/ their first child.", "YTA \n\nThis is HUGE and you put out her fire because you care about a fetus' genitalia. I know that's a crazy way to put it, but geez. Ask \"do you know the gender\" not \"any updates\" since it's clear you only see her as a baby maker and not a person with their own feelings and struggles.", "YTA. Let me ask you: what were you hoping to accomplish by telling her that eating an onion wasn\u2019t an achievement? That was just mean and absolutely unnecessary to finding out more information about your future grandchild. All you had to do was say \u201coh that\u2019s great,\u201d maybe ask one more question about the restaurant and if she had anything else she liked there to be polite, and then switch topics and ask how the baby and mom are doing health wise. You put her down just to put her down.\n\nI have a feeling that if your son immediately left after this comment, there is some context we\u2019re missing and this isn\u2019t the first time you\u2019ve done something like this.", "\u201cI don\u2019t care about the health and happiness of you, i only give a shit about the baby\u2019s health, now shut your mouth.\u201d Do you happen to have any other examples of being a truly shitty person?", "YTA> getting over a phobia *is* the achievement, not the specific silly thing you had a phobia from. Every phobia is over a small thing, otherwise it would be 'fear'. So every phobia overcoming involves doing something that is small - touching a bug, climbing a ladder, eating onion etc. And it's a big achievement. And it's a good victory before parenthood, because you know you can come over your fears, so it's a good preparation.", "YTA. Your son is absolutely correct in his assessment of you. Not once did you care about her health and her nutrition, which in case you forgot directly impacts this grand baby you keep mentioning. If I were them, I wouldn\u2019t let you near the baby. You aren\u2019t entitled to being close to a child when you clearly don\u2019t give af about said child\u2019s mother.", "YTA and yes telling her 'I don't care what's going on with you I just want to know about my grandchild your carrying' is acting like she is just an incubator. Good on your son for calling you out. She's still a person with feelings and those aren't invalid just because you can't ask a direct question. You asked how they were. You should have asked how's the grandbaby since you don't care at all about the woman holding it.", "YTA. When someone has an eating disorder, even if it's not trauma related, you have to take the little steps with them if you give a fuck. You're so zeroed in on this grandbaby that you're just erasing the fact that the woman bearing that grandchild has serious health concerns and eating an onion and expanding her food palate IS A HUGE ACHIEVEMENT FOR HER. Your lack of fucks about her and only treating her like an incubator for your precious baby that will be HER child is pretty gross. \n\nYou don't have to like her. But you also don't have to crush her goddamn dreams and achievements. You're not a nice person and I can see why your son reacted the way he did.", "YTA. It may not be a big achievement for you but it is for her. You could at least pretend to care", "YTA\n\nListen to what your son said. Regardless of what you and your husband think, your son told you very clearly what he and his wife think. Your words and actions caused them to feel like this. So regardless of how much your husband reassures you, that you weren't in the wrong, your son thinks you were massively in the wrong. And your son won't change his mind unless you change your behaviour.", "You: I don\u2019t think your continuing recovery from your eating disorder is an accomplishment so I\u2019m just going to interrupt you, make you feel like you\u2019re a loser for having an ED in the first place, and insist we talk about what I want to talk about. \n\nObviously YTA.", "YTA without a doubt. Trauma doesn\u2019t stop just because you became an adult. It\u2019s something you deal with for your entire life. And an eating disorder is no different. For a lot of people in eating disorder recovery, getting pregnant can be a huge battle. It involves a lot of the things you\u2019re not supposed to do when recovering from an eating disorder: restricting the types of foods you eat, calorie counting is often recommended, and there\u2019s so many severely triggering changes happening to the body. It IS a big deal that she was able to eat something she wasn\u2019t able to before. And the more you belittle that fact the more damage you\u2019re doing to the hard work she\u2019s put in. She needs to maintain healthy eating habits in order to take care of the grandchild you\u2019re so desperate to hear about, so please try and be more patient and empathetic with how big of a deal these things are. Because you\u2019re only going to end up doing more damage than you really realize.", "YTA\n\nYou wrote about her traumatic past, how she is working on it and expanding her menu with the help of your son. That's actually something to be proud of. She's working on it and of course proud that she was able to eat an onion. For you and me that's nothing, but for her that is a huge achievement. \n\nHave some empathy and compassion! You really do treat her like an incubator and don't seem to care at all about her as a person. No wonder they're all upset with you. Are you always this dismissive? \n\nApologize and work on your empathy or else you definitely won't see your grandchild at all.", "Firstly are you sure your husband REALLY agreed with you? Or is he just keeping the peace. The fact that none of your children with growing independence agreed with you, makes me think the later.\n\nSecondly Laylah is here and now, her child... and yes I agree, it's her child first not your grandchild is not. If they had something big like the sex to share, they would tell you when they are ready and once they've discussed the health and wellbeing of the mother to be. And food intake is part of the health of the mother, especially when eating disorders are involved. It may have been only an onion to you  but to your son, its a big step towards a more balanced eating household which will have a positive impact on his children.\n\nYes YTA", "Ok. Wow. Do you not have any empathy? Can you not support your loved ones? I have a family member, 20 yo, with social anxiety. The courage it took for them to walk into a shop, alone, and buy a drink was immense. You bet your arse we celebrated the hell out of that. It was a huge achievement. You know what that encouragement and support did? Gave them confidence to do other things, alone, without one of their parents with them. I\u2019m disgusted with your behaviour. Your son is correct with with his words and actions. You are not the type of person that should be around children that thrive on praise and recognition since you are deficient in providing it. YTA.", "YTA: You basically told her to shut up and only talk about what you want to hear. Rude.", "YTA! Holy bananas are YTA.  She's overcoming something traumatic that happened to her, but that doesn't matter, how's MY grandchild.  First you sound like my mom with that and it's not a compliment.  She always does this possessive thing with my son if anyone tries to show love for him that isn't her.  That's what it sounds like you're doing.  It's rude, disgusting, and quite frankly angers me.  That's MY \"son's name\".  Yuck! Don't do that crap.  Second, I hope your son doesn't allow you around that baby.  If this post is anything to go by, you'll mentally poison them.  I'm proud of your son for standing up for his wife.", "If you wanted to hear an update about the grandbaby, you should have just asked that. Instead you were rude when she didn\u2019t know what you \u2018really\u2019 meant and shamed her for her trauma. \n\nYTA", "YTA. Hold up honey. It is an anchievement especially after having an eating disorder. You've already declared yourself what kind of parent you are by just your post. Eating disorders are very serious despite what you may think. I'm very proud of your DIL for being able to do this. You should be too! You only see her as an incubator for your grandbaby. Well, the way you just shut her down and told her you don't care about her and you only care about the grandbaby well you won't be seeing that grandbaby now.", "I\u2019m going to tell you this in hopes of it waking you up before it\u2019s too late. Before that baby is your grandchild, it is HER baby. They feel like you are treating her as an incubator, and you are. I have a feeling this was not the first incident. You owe her a massive apology. You have to realize that so much of that baby\u2019s affection for you will depend on how you treat their mother. How would the baby feel about the comments you made if it were five years from now and they had been sitting at the table? My grandparents alienated my mother and made passive aggressive comments toward her my entire life. They now have zero relationship with me. I don\u2019t attend holidays, events, nothing. If my mother isn\u2019t family, I\u2019m not either. Children develop loyalty very quickly. I very much suggest you don\u2019t put yourself on the opposite side.", "YTA\n\nYou spent the whole first part of this post explaining why your DIL discovering that she likes new foods is a big deal and that she has an eating disorder that she is actively trying to manage and still can't see why YTA?\n\nIf you wanted to know about how her pregnancy was going then that is the question that you should have asked, but it isn't, you asked how she is doing and she told you.\n\nHer answer was clearly important to her and she wanted to share it and you couldn't even be bothered to do the bare minimum and just say 'that's good, I'm glad you have found something else that you like', your son is right, you basically didn't care about how she is doing, only the child she is carrying, making it clear you only care about her as an incubator. Also, if your son was that quick to raise preventing you access, I doubt this is the first time you have said or done something to hurt your DIL", "YTA \n\n>At some point in her life Leylah had a traumatic experience involving food, which caused her to eat only 3-4 things for a long time and she was diagnosed with eating disorder.\n\n>We get talking and I have asked how they are doing and if they have any news, hoping they will share something about my grandchild.

This is something she and your son have been working really hard on, she's made so much progress. This is something that should make you proud of her. But what do you do? Interrupt her, insult her, and show more interest in a baby that hasn't even been born yet. \n\nHere's the thing. Leylah is always going to have that eating disorder. She may be eating more foods now than she did before, but she could always relapse. And making her feel bad about her progress could lead to that relapse.

She lived in the same neighbourhood and went to the same school as my son \"Sam\" (27m), where they became friends. They have been together for about 6 years and married for 2. Leylah is currently 6 months pregnant with my first grandchild. \n\nAt some point in her life Leylah had a traumatic experience involving food, which caused her to eat only 3-4 things for a long time and she was diagnosed with eating disorder. With Sam she managed to expand her menu and is less scared to try new things. Normally when Leylah tries a new food and likes it Sam makes sure to celebrate it.\n\nWe had a pre thanksgiving dinner this weekend as Leylah and Sam were planning to have a small holiday with Leylah's aunty in Greece. We get talking and I have asked how they are doing and if they have any news, hoping they will share something about my grandchild. Instead Leylah started talking how she tried onion for the first time in years in that very nice Greek restaurant and how much she enjoyed the taste. I have stopped her half way there and said I don't think that trying an onion is an achievement and wanted to hear how my grandchild is doing and if they know the gender yet.\n\nLeylah got really quiet and Sam told me and my husband they will be leaving. I have asked what is wrong and Sam had a go at me saying I am being a massive asshole for not caring about Leylah and her happiness, for putting her down and making her feel like an incubator for my grand babies and to her eating a new food is an achievement due to extremely traumatic past. He also said he is not sure if he wants to let me to have access to my grandchild due to how I have treated the future mother. After both of them left.\n\nMy husband agrees with me and doesn't see what I did wrong, but the rest of my kids are furious with me and told me I should have my mouth shut.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

OP YTA, you literally told your DIL that you couldn't care less about her, she's nothing more than a vessel for your grandchild, and that's should be an automatic loss of grandparent *privileges*, you're just vile.", "Absolutely, I have a niece who has issues with flavours, smells and textures and whenever she can bring herself to try something new it\u2019s a huge achievement for her. I cannot imagine how OP\u2019s DIL felt after going through that kind of effort and then being put down from such a great height. This kind of reaction is so harmful and YTA, OP.", "Yup, this. OP YTA", "This soooo much! Even if the DIL didn't have trauma, I'd still want to talk about how she liked/disliked it, because that's what family does - shows interest in one another. \n\nShe asked how they were doing then got nasty because what they shared wasn't about her or her bloodline. I also doubt they made the incubator comment, walked out, and threatened LC/NC over a single incident. The one thing OP did right was having a son that would stand up for his wife. \n\nOP - YTA", "This.  YTA", "This! So much this! I'm starting to regain the ability to trust food again. So every time I reintroduce a food to my diet that makes me feel good, it's one of the best feelings on earth.\nI only share with a couple people I know who get it, because a reaction like this will mess me up.\n\nI'm 37 and still give myself gold star type rewards for things like this.\n\nOP YTA.", "There\u2019s no slightly YTA about this it\u2019s FULL ON YTA", "Plus the fact op comment on another comment that trauma is ok for kids and teens not adults she\u2019s being a bad parent lol seriously how can having trauma make you a bad parent when the kid isn\u2019t even here yet, fck wouldn\u2019t make it bad parent if kid was here op is trash", "Why the focus on achievements? I told my parents when I spoke to them at the weekend about a really delicious apple I ate last week. And I eat apples all the time. They were happy to hear about it.\n\nI'd be interested, like genuinely interested, if it came up in conversation that someone ate their first onion in years. Whether it's an achievement or not, it's certainly notable and good conversation fodder.", "While I agree OP is the asshole I dont really follow the \"using my grandchild and not their child\"\n\nIf I was going to refer to my grandmother or aunt while talking to my mom I would always say \"my grandmother\" \"my aunt\" ( altho prob use their real name since I got 2) and never \"your mother\" or \"your sister\".\n\nIt just feels more natural??", "That's good that you're so compassionate over it.\n\nUgh - my family made fun of my extremely picky eating my entire childhood right up until I was 22 and screamed at my mother about it. Ironically, it was something I did to have *control* over some aspect of my life and now it's such a deeply worn pattern that I *don't* have control over it and struggle to expand my palate. All of it made exponentially worse by having all these complicated, frustrated feelings because it was so persistently made fun of by my family.\n\nNever an ounce of acknowledgement that it was a response to my chaotic and unhealthy upbringing, either. It's just simply childish obstinance for *no reason* - how fun.", "Yeah, even if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s an achievement, you can just say \u201cI\u2019m so glad you enjoyed it,\u201d and let the conversation flow naturally from there. Nobody was asking OP to strike up the marching band, just to employ basic politeness to a member of her family.", "As someone with a small safe food list, I get bored having to eat so much because it\u2019s a LOT of repetitious tastes. A lot of people don\u2019t get it when I say eating food is meh and it gets boring. \n\nSister said she didn\u2019t feel up to making food for a few weeks and kept eating toast cause it was fast and she had to eat SOMETHING. Shocked that she wasn\u2019t interested in eating period because she was bored eating just toast. Shocked that this happened with me but finally understood it and used it to bond closer.", "Mostly just because that was the topic at hand. I don't see a problem with it being small talk but it seemed like celebrating the little things is OP's problem.", "Agree! And her husband (future grandpa) is an enabler.", "What made your family stop badgering you about it?\n\nAlso, that's super awful of those people. I hope you're able to get the proper nutrition. My smell and taste got super f'd after that virus in '20; still recovering actually and have new experiences with the same foods every day. Makes eating difficult for someone with sensory issues, then add a restricted diet by a medical condition. LOL!!!\n\nEdit: typo", "Yep! They were having a conversation over dinner and mid story the OP interrupted to tell \u201cLeylah\u201d that her story of overcoming trauma isn\u2019t interesting and that she needs to tell everyone about the baby. I can\u2019t believe that she, as a parent, can\u2019t understand how it was rude to interrupt her DIL\u2019s story. It does make it sound like all she cares about is the grand baby and I\u2019m amazed that both her and husband don\u2019t think what she did was wrong. \nIf the situation was reversed and the OP was mid story about eating some new food at a Greek restaurant and her DIL interrupted to tell them something about the baby would OP be okay with it?", "I can almost guarantee that OP has had a conversation with Leylah about \\[insert hobby/concern/social group here\\] that Leylah absolutely doesn't care about and Leylah politely listened to her talk without interrupting because that's what normal humans do.", "Especially when you *asked*. She had a specific question she wanted the answer to and asked a completely different question anyway then got upset when no one read her mind so she interrupted the answer to the question *she did ask* to say \u201cnone of that deeply personal stuff matters, let\u2019s talk about what *I want* that you should\u2019ve just known I was asking about because why would I ask about anything but myself?\u201d \n\nI can\u2019t tell if this OP is self aware or not. Like is she fully cognizant of the fact she cannot be bothered to talk about people that are not her and she just doesn\u2019t see why that\u2019s a potential issue for people around her or is she just\u2026 like that?", "Yes, basic manners!!! OP, do you treat other people this way, or do you reserve this level of disrespect for your DIL? YTA.", "Speaking a a very long-time husband, sometimes you know your wife is in the wrong, but \\*you\\* have to live with her and sleep next to her tonight, so in the moment, at least, you agree with her and hope to god you can figure out some way of gently bringing her around to realizing she's wrong without her getting pissed and going scorched-earth on your ass.\n\nApropos of nothing, but I felt I needed to get that out there.", "OP: YTA. Food is such a big part of most culture that not being able to enjoy it is a huge inconvenience to the person with limitations (most times). I don\u2019t eat meat (texture thing) and it had 100% negatively impacted my life. I don\u2019t like fried foods or cake and I don\u2019t like a lot of other foods that are considered \u2018good\u2019 by the vast majority of people. When I was willing to try the salmon my bf made just tasting it was a big deal. Actually likeing it? We celebrated. When he tried salad again and the lettuce didn\u2019t taste like dirt to him for the first time in 20 something years? That was a big deal. He will get a smidge of saut\u00e9ed veg that I make for me and like it because it isn\u2019t the steamed grossness he was used to. He may not like the texture but he can eat it with his meat. We celebrate these wins because we don\u2019t want our future children to struggle as we do. It\u2019s exciting when our horizons open for us just a little bit more than they were the day before. That\u2019s a huge deal to us, something worth celebrating.", "Just a side note.\nIt is a nice and good idea. \nBut if anyone plans to go to a restaurant to try a countries food before traveling there. \nCheck out how authentic it is first. \nAlot of recipes are so far from the food they serve in x country. \nSpecially if you are in amarica and you go to Europe (seen alot of surpriced tourists when they can't get a dish served at their favourite restaurant back home, friends from other countries says the same) \nLike any dish with pasta is \"Italian/Italian inspired\" or anything with noodles are Asian. Etc etc. Ingredients that aren't native for a country.\nBut it night not be like the food you can actually eat at a local restaurant in x country.\n\nSo seriously (in Europe too) check how authentic a restaurant is first before you use \"try the food before traveling first\" or compare a menu to a food travels guide. Or you might end surpriced when travel.", "Your wife sucks\nSource ; this is the dynamic between my narcissistic mother and my eternally unhappy and cowardly father.\n\nLiving this way has aged him, good luck to you.", "Nope, I\u2019ve been married 25 years and when I (or the wife) are wrong we call each other out on it. Our way of thinking is there isn\u2019t any point in letting the other suffer from a \u201cdelusion of grandeur\u201d or, in this case, \u201crightness\u201d. When you\u2019re wrong you\u2019re wrong, no maybe.", "As someone who has a small list of \u201csafe\u201d foods, it is so very hard to expand when you also have an eating disorder. ANY progress- even if it\u2019s \u201cI ate an onion piece and didn\u2019t want to vomit!\u201d, is a celebration. You could have listened and said you were happy for her, then inquire about her health, THEN ask updates about babies. YTA because you basically, as others have said, boiled it down to \u201cyou\u2019re a breeder without emotional validity\u201d.", "And having issues with a common ingredient, like onion, is a HUGE barrier to enjoying food. I've got an allergy/intolerance/some sort of issue with rosemary. Not a huge deal- until there's nice Italian food. Then I get to eat bread, and sometimes not even that is safe. \n\nIf I found a way to tolerate rosemary without regretting every decision ever, you bet I'd be celebrating from the rooftops. And that's without adding the emotional work to overcome a mental block due to trauma!"]}
