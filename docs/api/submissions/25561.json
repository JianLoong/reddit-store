I own a plumbing company and hired my brother 3 years ago. He was jobless after the pandemic and I offered for him to come work for me. He was 22 at the time, and is now looking to become a master plumber and start his own business. \n\nAt my wedding, in which he was the best man, he decided that during his speech he would give us all a big surprise and decided to propose to his long time girlfriend. Me and my wife were appalled. We both feel like he stole the shine from our day. Everyone else in our families were so excited and kept taking pictures with her, looking at the ring, etc.\n\nI decided to fire him the very next day. He still doesn\u2019t understand why. He claims I\u2019m being selfish and irrational, and our parents agree. They\u2019re saying that \u201cbusiness should be separate from our personal lives\u201d, but I just can\u2019t overlook what he did and how he ruined our day. Am I overthinking this??\n\nEDIT: I should have mentioned this, but he will be getting severance. He is still my brother, and I wouldn\u2019t let him lose his home over this. But as a small business I can\u2019t imagine seeing him every day at work. Not now at least.\n\nEDIT 2: I reached out to him and we plan on speaking later today in person.\n\nEDIT 3: I love all of the people who say \u201cyou\u2019ve been looking for a reason to fire him\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re just jealous\u201d. He was my best man. I never felt upset about him opening his own business, in fact he has my complete blessing. This job was only supposed to be to get him on his feet again. I\u2019m so happy he liked the field and wants to go further in it.

No disrespect  or judgement intended. It's both a strength and weakness) But let me make this clear. No. A wedding is not \"all about you\". Clearly this is a lie, because if it was, you wouldn't have invited guests... Furthermore, traditionally, the purpose of the wedding ceremony specifically is to bind a marriage within a community. You literally are inviting witnesses, who are meant to be your family, friends and neighbours, to participate in the ceremony. Their job is to witness your vows, and to hold you accountable to said vows in the future. They are meant to be the people who you can/will rely upon in the future to help you when you are struggling. And if I can be honest, it disgusts me how the modern marriage/wedding has become effectively an exercise  of vanity. \n\nMy judgement doesn't even require me to look at the fact that you sought revenge by doing one of the lost horrible things you can do to someone who is below you in power. You took them in, in trust, and now your throwing them out just because they did something you don't like. I do not accept for 1 second that it's \"immature\" to do what he did. You and yours may have this \"understanding\". But I can 100% garuntee you that a huge proportion of society do not agree with your assessment. Unfortunately Reddit is a toxic cesspool of incel adjacents, so the NTA verdicts are expected. \n\nBut, respectfully, kindly, Im asking you to undo what youve done to your brother even if he's gonna quit and start his own business tomorrow. Accept that he upset you. That's fine. You're entitled to your opinion and standards. But at least 'de-radicalise' yourself on this. Understand that different people have different standards and expectations. And try and find joy in the fact that your marriage is helping your beloved brother start his own (hopefully) happy and successful relationship and family in the future. Instead of looking at it as he's taken something from you, instead you've given something to him!! Be like me. Find the joy in this situation. You're now a kingmaker in your family and community.
