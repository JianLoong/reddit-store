If it were me as the parent, I would have taken the child into the bathroom with me, knowing full well there were bedrooms with doors open and a huge flight of stairs she could have fallen down.\n\nBedroom was left open for guests to leave their coats / bags in there as we do not have a cloakroom.", "Sorry I am a parent as well,  and I have always made sure I knew exactly where my children were and never allowed myself to be so distracted by a conversation that I was not aware of my children, you can have a conversation and keep an eye on your children.  Or I ensured that there was someone I have asked and received consent to leave them with.  That is the responsibility of parenthood once you become a parent, you are always a parent.  You can have adult time (in every sense of that phrase) but you still have to make a plan for your children.  And even if the child slips from your sight for any reason you are still 100% responsible for what they do.", "The mirror could have fallen on the child or the child could have stepped on broken glass or tried to eat it. Children and sharp things are not a good combination.", "Could have found a plugged in hair straightener and switched it on by herself.", "I nearly gave my mother a heart attack when I learned how to bounce on my bouncy horse until I\u2019d gained enough momentum to launch myself over the baby gate. Fortunately it was just into the kitchen, not down the stairs.", "You're lucky. My son at that age had the hand strength and dexterity.. thankfully, we weren't living with any stairs in the house at the time, so the gates were mainly to corral him away from the kitchen, but I swear I lost 5 yrs of my life the first time he opened it. And another 5 when he lifted my 20 lb kettle bell weight over his head at 18 months.", "A short-term solution or in some cases a long term solution is a bungee cord added to the gate. Again lack of strength will prevent them from getting the bungee cord off.\n\nWe favor putting the middle of the bungee cord in a half knot at the hinge side of the gate and then hooking both hooks to keep the gate shut. It also works to hold the gate open in the circumstances that you need that. You unhook one of the ends and put the other end at the edge opening edge of the gate. It keeps the gate open when you have to go in and out a lot.", "Okay I love the d20 reference!", "I don't have kids and that's the first thing I thought.", "I think it's time she is no longer invited over. Let her know it's because she refuses to properly supervise her children and they continue to break your belongings and you cannot afford that. Visit at her home", "Right! People getting mad he wasn't paying attention to the kid, he's hosting a party? You can bring your kid but it's your responsibility to watch him not the host.", "It\u2019s OP\u2019s responsibility to protect themself & ensure kids are safe in their home. Or don\u2019t invite people with kids.\n\nEdit word", "Both you & your sister have the ability to control this situation. Kids need boundaries. It\u2019s in your own best interest to protect yourself when kids are in your home. Put some rules in place. \n\nMy sisters & I have 8 kids between us. Often hosted family events in our home when they were they were little. All the adults helped to keep an eye on the kids or made certain an adult was there & responsible for watching them. First priority is kids safety. Yes, they are your sister\u2019s kids so she needs to watch them however it\u2019s every adult at your party responsibility to ensure kids are safe. Or just stop inviting your sister over.", "Eh I mean it varies from person to person. I have a big family so I\u2019m just a bit more understanding ig.", "At some point I agree that you have to talk about it. However, I cannot find that multiple items have been broken in her post.", "Nah that\u2019s not the point I am making. I specifically said she should offer to pay for the mirror. I also say you should not ask your sister for money over that.\n\nAnd if push come to shove I would rather sit in the 60 than demanding my sister to pay. It\u2019s better for the relationship.", "Depending on how the conversation went, perhaps she is more upset that she is somehow getting blamed and being held responsible when it sounds like it should have been your sister's partner's responsibility to pay for the mirror.", "In my country a freestanding mirror fell on a toddler (toddler and older kid were playing unsupervised around it) and the toddler died", "Kids are nuts", "We tend to just shut the entire door sometimes.", "Thanks!", "or maybe the parents should watch their toddler instead of leaving them unsupervised?", "This is complete nonsense. The parents are responsible for their children and have to pay for whatever their child breaks", "Fair enough, however our initial suggestion to her was that she hired a babysitter, however she refused to do that. I was busy hosting 50 guests with food and drinks so did not have the time to monitor the 2 children and their whereabouts.", "Becouse it's not in the post but in the comments", "They really are at times. He would just one-handed pick up my 20 lb kettlebell (which weighed maybe less than 10 lbs than he did at the time) and walk around with it over his head like it was nothing.", "I am not blaming you. No doubt you were busy. I\u2019m just offering my perspective. You have all the liability when hosting people in your home. Protecting yourself is important. If you don\u2019t trust your sister to watch her own kids then tell her that! Let her know she won\u2019t be invited back because you\u2019re concerned about the safety of her kids. It\u2019s not about the money. \n\nThis was a family party \u2026. Were there no other adults there? Aunt\u2019s, Grandparents, these kids Dad? Next time tag one of your family & ask them to keep an eye on kids. It\u2019s in your own best interest to just solve the problem.", "Shit. I wish I had that kind of strength to weight ratio as an adult. Just one-hand like 135 lb and walk around like it\u2019s an umbrella.", "My best friend's youngest is like that. We call him baby hulk. Possibly related to children being nuts I choose auntihood over parenthood. I don't think parenting is in my wheelhouse LOL. I make an excellent aunt and will gladly do diapers and things but keep a tiny human alive 24/7 and bring them up to a be a good fully grown human? That sounds hard. I have enough trouble taking care of me 24/7 LOL.", "So far, my daughter is petite and my son is stout. They\u2019re 2-1/2 yeses and 5 months now, but I assume one day she\u2019s going to try to pick him up and he\u2019ll just be like \u201cnaw, sis\u201d and throw her over his shoulder. lol", "Haha, same!   I just spent 2 weeks with my sister and her family and had a blast being the fun aunt, but no way, no how would I deem myself capable of raising a child! Taking care of myself is enough, thank you!", "Nta, but, wtf. Who lets a 1.5 year old wander around on their own? She ONLY broke the mirror. The glass pieces could have cut her. What if she fell down the stairs? I cant imagine. What if she found some knife, forget that, what if she walked on a pin or nail or something? The what ifs are innumerable. Who lets a kid that young unsupervised?", "Was no one concerned that a 2 year old was wandering around in a room with an unsecured mirror?  \n\nI think ESH because you're both focused on the wrong thing.   \n\nYou had a mirror dangerously unsecured in a bedroom where children *could* wander into and out off.  Even if your sister had been vigilant, your niece could have gotten in there and hurt herself in a matter of minutes.   \n\nYour sister left her child unsupervised in a room with a dangerously unsecured mirror. \n\nInstead both of you are pressed over a $60 mirror. \n\nDo better.", "If this mirror was big enough to be propped against a wall, it's really fortunate the toddler wasn't hurt. Your sister should have kept a better eye on her child, but you could have been held liable if your niece had been injured by flying glass. \n\nMom should just pay the money; moving forward, you should be proactive about items being out of reach when children are in the house. \n\nNow, this being Reddit, it's your house and you can do what you like. But doing so would spare you and your guests a lot of heartache and aggravation should a curious child get into something that could harm them. NTA.", "NTA - HEr toddler is her responsibility and she left it unsupervised.  Totally your sister's fault.", ">The mirror was leaning against a wall and she therefore thinks it is our fault. \n\nNTA\n\nThe mirror could even be **on the floor and ready to be stepped on** it would still not be your fault.\n\nToddlers are not to be left unsupervised in their own home, much less at someone else's!\n\nYour sister is being ridiculous", "NTA\n\nYour sister should have :  \n1) Thanked God that her daughter wasn't cut by the glass  \n2) Apologized  \n3) Immediately offered to pay", "NTA. Y'all really live differently from us Germans, I had to chuckle while reading the title. Here you have to have a Haftpflichtversicherung which is mandatory (Pflicht!) Insurance for things you might be liable for (Haft). So this would be nothing but a little paperwork... Which we apparently love.", "What the hell? No, absolutely NTA. This is  completely on your sister, and frankly I can't believe her baby-neglecting ass thinks she has the moral high ground", "NTA", "I think she should have offered to pay. \nHow long was the kid alone? \nWas the kid put there to nap and woke up?", "YTA for putting coats and bags on your bed \ud83e\udd22", "NTA she was seriously negligent.", "Your sister is an asshole", "NTA. \n\nParents are responsible for their children. Period. Dot. Don't like their behavior? Parent better. Supervise better. Or just pony up when the damage or destroy something.", "Next time, no kids allowed party \ud83d\udc4d ur welc", "NTA, because your sister needed to be shown that there are consequences to such carelessness. Hopefully, shelling out $60 will teach her to pay more attention to her baby's whereabouts. I am glad the baby is okay.", "ESH\n\nAsking sis to pay was entirely appropriate.\n\nYou knew there would be toddler/s in attendance, the mirror should have been secured, and your room childproofed, as well as most of the rest of the home. \n\nEither bar the upstairs, or lock your bedroom and bathrooms while children are free roaming your home, or give the parents the key to unlock rooms they need access to, and return the key when finished.", "9p", "When your kid breaks something -- particularly in a situation like this in which a toddler obviously should have been supervised-- it's your responsibility to pay for it.\n\nKid breaks; parent pays.  The end.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Geez she needs to keep an eye on her child!", "NTA - OMG but that little child could have been badly hurt. What was she thinking, leaving the baby alone like that to wander and get into things . . . Things could have been so much worse and permanent damage could have happened. What is the matter with parents leaving their little ones like that! You watch them every second, like a hawk . . especially when out of the family home that is hopefully child proofed . . . and even then you have a million safeguards against child endangerment.", "The child is a BABY lol. OP says 1.5 years. Definitely the parents' fault", "I\u2019m thinking about all the things baby might have gotten into in people\u2019s purses.. sister is really lucky they just paid for a mirror and didn\u2019t end up in the ER.", "My son was 2 when he took a tumble down the stairs. It was my friends house and I was there, her pre-teen daugther went downstairs and my son followed. My friends son who was the same age knew how to navigate the stairs, but not my son. I had turned my back for literally 2 seconds...he had been with me, and then I heard a crash and tumble. My friends daughter started screaming and then my son let out this wail. I ran to the stairs to see he had fallen down them. I was sooooo scared. Luckily he was alright. \n\nAll it takes is 2 seconds.", "Babies are always at 2 failed death saves and rolling at disadvantage. Wild little things need SO much attention!", "As told by Dad... He was a toddler in the 1930s left unattended while his parents threw a party. He crawled up on the bed where everyone had tossed their coats and purses, opened all the purses, took out the dollars, and proceeded to use them to wipe his bum.\n\nHis parents and the women guests were not amused ;)\n\nAnd that was a relatively safe thing. Scary things can happen when you blink and toddlers go wild.", "It's not just obvious things like mirrors and stairs, either - even larger things like dressers or bookshelves, if not secured, could fall over.", "I have heard so many stories of toddlers falling down the stairs and dying.", "I\u2019m pretty sure that \u201cwild\u201d Is part of the definition of toddlers\u2026", "Kids are suicidal!\n\nJust today, mine was jumping into the couch cushions we placed on the floor at his request. We were there with him and he kept trying to jump onto the **edge** of the pillows, not the middle. \n\nI \"saved\" him like three times by grabbing his arm and making sure he was dropping into the middle. The one time I didn't grab him, he literally bounced off the ledge onto the hardfloor, fell on his knees.\n\nThis was **supervised**", "It was tongue in cheek ;)", "No I get it. I was agreeing and making a joke (though Badly)."]}
