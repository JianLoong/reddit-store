It could be her post partum hormones making her act ridiculous, but either way she is in the wrong.", "NTA, it was a joke with your friend, who took it very well. She might have been upset however : 1-She didn't tell you that she was upset nor why 2-She didn't want your explanation when you reached to apologise and even blocked you. You wanted to clear the misunderstading she refused to hear you.\n\nTheir break up is NOT your fault, by the way he told you to not apologise because she was in the wrong, I'm sure there were things going on before and I think her reaction was the last straw for him. (sorry english isn't my first language)", "NTA\n\nBut I find it weird he would break up with her for something arguably minor, especially if they just had a kid. I also find it a little strange for a 25 y/o to be hanging with a 17 y/o, not saying anything weird is going on, I obviously just know what you wrote here, but just be cautious", "Nta. In my 20s we did this too. In my 50s not so much", "NTA\n\nYou had no idea, you made an honest effort to talk to her about it.", "NTA. You are not responsible for his relationship falling apart. He is though. Only an immature person would break up with the parent of their recently born child over something like this. You haven't done anything wrong.     \n     \nI do want to comment on the age difference though. It is possible that your friendship with him is normal and safe. I think there are a few things you should look out for that can be red flags. You don't have to answer these questions but maybe keep them in the back of your mind to watch out for yourself. Does he try to get you to hang out with him alone? How would he react if you had a boyfriend/girlfriend? What if you wanted him to be friends with your boyfriend/girlfriend, how do you think he would react? Does he touch you in small, possibly flirty ways (Like touching your lower back, knees)? Does he say your mature for your age? Does he know your parents and how do they feel about him?", "NTA\n\nKey words? she's just had a baby\n\nShes likely having a hard time with emotional regulation cause hormones, try to cut her some slack for the apparent insanity. \n\nBecause you have that running joke, that's a sweet little addon (only thing, i would have looked for one to put the sunglasses in, she wouldve hated me too)", "So, his girlfriend has just had a baby, he's 25 and flirting with a 17 year old, and you're surprised she's put out?\n\nNTA, but read the room.", "NTA. This has absolutely nothing to do with the coffin. She doesn't like that he's friends with another woman. She also recently had a baby and has to be dealing with post partum feelings. I wouldn't feel bad about the coffin but she and BF really need to talk.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You might not realise what's going on here, but you're 17, so that's what happens. From what you've said, you didn't see her freak out: you've got his explanation for it. I'm willing to bet money that she thinks you are either the \"other woman\" or that she thinks he would like you to be the other woman. Take a step back from the gift and the joke and look at this dynamic: If he's a grown man with a new child, why is he spending time making jokes with a 17 year old? Yes, her hormones are probably a mess. But I think she's probably cross about a bit more than a plastic coffin gift.", "No.\nSpend 2 seconds checking my profile. \nJust no.", "i totally get how this seems but i really have no other way of explaining it. he's always been a good friend to me and vice-versa. i also don't understand why we are not to be hanging out and sharing inside jokes because he is a new father. /gen. i get that being a new father is a crap ton of work but according to aj it does not take away from his or his girlfriends social life too much. (ie: they both will hang out with their best friend separately when they need some free time)\n\nabout the other woman thing, i understand how it seems that way but im 17 and he's 25 there is no chance anything would happen, and i've met his gf before she seemed genuinely cool with me\n\n  \nbut yeah im gonna take your advice and take a step back from the joke and the dynamic and give them their space as a couple.", "no", ">i get that being a new father is a crap ton of work but according to aj it does not take away from his or his girlfriends social life\n\nOh, my sweet summer child. \n\n\"According to AJ\"\n\n Either he is not being honest with you, and I will defer to your knowledge of his character and your friendship and assume he is not, or he has an awful lot of growing up and stepping up to do that you aren't seeing. And now he's talking about breaking up with her? At 25, it's fair for the mother of his child to have had certain expectations, and instead, he's acting like a teenager.\n\nTo be clear: I think you are NTA.
