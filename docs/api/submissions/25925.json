But it's a very valid thing to be upset about. It's not vanity. Youth and beauty for women is a social currency. Women who look visibly older, such as having gray hair, are treated worse in the world. Of course it's upsetting to be treated worse, seen as worth less because of your age and how you look. It IS upsetting. Your wife's feelings are valid. You are being insensitive because you're younger. Sure, there's not much to be done about aging. So you might as well not get upset, and accept what you can't change. But we live in a cruel world that tells women their value is wrapped up in their appearance and youth. So when you lose that \"value,\" of course it feels bad! Obviously appearance shouldn't have anything to do with a person's worth, but that's not how we're treated. There are tangible, real-world consequences to looking older like discrimination, but we act like women are stupid or vain to care about their looks.\n\nAll you can do is let your wife feel her feelings and try to be supportive. It's ok to tell her you think she's beautiful and aging doesn't matter to you, but don't diminish her feelings. It's not going to help. She's mourning her youth which may sound silly to you but it's not. And it's a painful process of acceptance she just has to go through.", "NAH \n\nhi!\ni started getting gray hairs at 18 and it took me three more years to realize the stress was coming from inside the house(\u26a0\ufe0f)\n\nYou tried your best, it sounds like your wife is bouncing between her insecurities about her image and maybe her mortality\n\nReminding her you're there in sickness and in health, through browns grays and yellows, will continue to help you both \ud83d\udc95\n\nBest of luck OP", "The real question is why are all these women editing in that they are women as if it changes anything?\n\nLike - if you were a man you\u2019d be an arsehole but if you\u2019re a lady/lesbian then it\u2019s \u201call good haha NTA lol\u201d\n\nDouble standards of our western society on show perhaps?!", "Ok just a little more description.... at first she was very upset yes, palpable.

That needed to stop and it did.", "NTA, sounds like some resources to help her accept the aging process might do her good. \nThe only alternative to aging is dying young. This society does not want us to embrace aging since women literally pay billions of dollars year to try to look younger. \nI have a friend like this, always comparing herself and jealous of younger women.

Compassion and love for your partner isn't about ease and convenience.", "I love dyeing my hair different colors (like green or blue) and life would be *so much easier* if I just had gray hair instead of having to bleach that shit!", "I\u2019m 43 and maybe one gray hair\u2026 like seriously want my silver mane. Genetics are wild, my cousin started greying at 23", "I had my first grey hair on my 21st birthday. I am rocking the Mr. Fantastic streaks at my temples!", "It was, I didn't see you in the bedroom with us, quit hiding under the bed.", "Omg what if she likes you too?", "This is the cutest comment I\u2019ve read ever", "Not all men go gray, plenty go bald. And that's not exactly stress free, either. I have never seen someone make fun of someone else for having grey hairs, but you see jokes of baldness constantly.\n\nWith one single exception, all of my bald friends are single, and struggle to get a date. Me and the friends that have hair, have no issue in finding dates. More than one bald friend confided in me that they a literally scared of dying alone, and one of them developed a big depression.\n\nPoint being, societal expectations affect everyone mentally, but at least for women it's not a factor in them finding a partner. I can do the \"it's worse for my gender\" as well.", "My mom (72) has a 2\u201d wide streak of grey that runs straight back from her temple and I\u2019m reaaaallly hoping that\u2019s the grey I get!", "I've never seen my mom's natural hair color and I still bleach mine because I'm self conscious over my dark blonde so I do understand! My mil has beautiful red/brown hair and I love her grey/silver streaking in! Watching women age is beautiful to me so I need to keep that mindset for myself", "I think that's awesome actually.  \n\nI went with platinum highlights and cut my hair short when the grey started overtaking my head and then used tinted shampoos and conditioners for fun.  I took lockdown as the opportunity to stop coloring my hair altogether.  While I still have some brown in back it doesn't look very different than when I was coloring it.  \n\nOr de-coloring it. \n\nWhatever.\n\nAnyway, my brothers AND my son were shocked a few months ago when they decided to tease me about coloring my hair and I informed them that this my real hair.  And has been for two years now.\n\nI love the color.  So does my hairdresser actually.\n\nJust get a super hip or bold haircut and rock that gorgeous snow white hair.", "Yes! Picture Mila Kunez calling herself a hag while ugly crying. IN WHAT WORLD?\n\nEdit:: she did say yes it is fun y now but then its wasn't.  But she understands why I had a quick giggle and attempted to compose myself. \n\nI was crying trying to pass a kidney stone and I said \"omg its like pissing out a knife on fire\" and she couldn't stop laughing at me. It happens, not the best thing to do but it happens"]}
