But it's a very valid thing to be upset about. It's not vanity. Youth and beauty for women is a social currency. Women who look visibly older, such as having gray hair, are treated worse in the world. Of course it's upsetting to be treated worse, seen as worth less because of your age and how you look. It IS upsetting. Your wife's feelings are valid. You are being insensitive because you're younger. Sure, there's not much to be done about aging. So you might as well not get upset, and accept what you can't change. But we live in a cruel world that tells women their value is wrapped up in their appearance and youth. So when you lose that \"value,\" of course it feels bad! Obviously appearance shouldn't have anything to do with a person's worth, but that's not how we're treated. There are tangible, real-world consequences to looking older like discrimination, but we act like women are stupid or vain to care about their looks.\n\nAll you can do is let your wife feel her feelings and try to be supportive. It's ok to tell her you think she's beautiful and aging doesn't matter to you, but don't diminish her feelings. It's not going to help. She's mourning her youth which may sound silly to you but it's not. And it's a painful process of acceptance she just has to go through.", "NAH \n\nhi!\ni started getting gray hairs at 18 and it took me three more years to realize the stress was coming from inside the house(\u26a0\ufe0f)\n\nYou tried your best, it sounds like your wife is bouncing between her insecurities about her image and maybe her mortality\n\nReminding her you're there in sickness and in health, through browns grays and yellows, will continue to help you both \ud83d\udc95\n\nBest of luck OP", "The real question is why are all these women editing in that they are women as if it changes anything?\n\nLike - if you were a man you\u2019d be an arsehole but if you\u2019re a lady/lesbian then it\u2019s \u201call good haha NTA lol\u201d\n\nDouble standards of our western society on show perhaps?!", "Ok just a little more description.... at first she was very upset yes, palpable.

This society does not want us to embrace aging since women literally pay billions of dollars year to try to look younger. \nI have a friend like this, always comparing herself and jealous of younger women.

I think she may stray into AH territory if she lingers on it or holds your response over your head, given the history of your relationship you've described, but given your ages and how sudden this is, did something trigger this in her? This sounds like a 'we need to sit a sec, what happened that has you so focused on age, aging, and appearance so harshly on yourself?' Kinda conversation. Is she okay?", "NTA- I mean you could basically tell her that if she stopped aging she would be trading that for death. Getting older is inevitable. Getting gray hair is like a badge of honour, does it suck sometimes, yes, but at the same time it shows a life you\u2019ve lived, just like smile lines by your eyes, or aging hands. It\u2019s not the end of the world. It\u2019s a privilege to grow older.", "You can tell her to be happy she\u2019s got hair.", "NTA. That exactly what she needs to do: get over it. Everyone is getting older, it's a natural process and there is nothing wrong with it. We are fed our insecurities by media and worry about pointless things we shouldn't. \n\nGrey hair is not even a health issue like getting fat or any other health issues. No one ever will look at you and think: Oh, that person has a few grey hair, gross.

It's life.", "I found my first grays this summer at 30, and ngl it freaks me out lol. But I just take a deep breath and get on with my life. I have friends my age and younger with a lot more grays than me. I just hate the sensation of growing older lol and anything that reminds me of it. Plus I've had a long fraught history with my hair.\n\nAnyway NAH. If she keeps pouting forever, that would be tiresome and unnecessary. But I'd allow her a few days to sulk. \ud83d\ude02", "I think she was being a bit dramatic but there might be deeper concerns under the surface that are coming out in the form of the more trivial examples of what she's upset about... She says she's upset she's aging and going grey but in her head she might be thinking about how everybody dies and wondering if she's spent her time right... But that's not the kind of thoughts that come out easily when we try to tell people that we are struggling with such concepts. \n\nI don't think the tough love did work if she brought it up again.. by doing that I think she's looking for an apology. \n\nShe doesn't need tough love, but to be fair.. compliments also won't make a dent in the potential existential crisis she's maybe currently got going on internally. \n\nDistractions can work, distractions, patience, cuddles and compassion. \n\nI don't think you're entirely the AH, and I'm sure she's in a state of mind that's tricky for a partner to navigate as her thoughts may be currently a bit all over the place, but I don't think you responded in a way that she needed and she's clearly still upset about it.\n\nI'm saying NTA but a softer approach could have made a big difference.", "You're not the AH - but let's see if you're so sanguine when your 50", "It's the problem of hair dye having been around for a few generations. People start greying in their twenties, we just hid it so well for a few generations that now with people colouring less we believe that there's something wrong with grey hair at that age.", "So you can cry about needing glasses, but she can't over grey hairs?\n \nSeems a bit hypocritical and insensitive when you did the same over glasses.", "NTA. \n\nI had quite a few grey hairs at 18 so I went to box dye. Still do at 51. Just change the color profile. Good luck OP.", "NAH. She cried, you tried\u2026 it happens.", "Nah, I had my first grey/white hair at 29, I now have lots that sparkle in the sun with my normal hair colour aged 32. I didn't get upset like your wife but I did quietly contemplate that I was now visibly ageing. \n\nI now have a chin hair that appears from nowhere and my once blonde and left well alone lip tash is now darkening. Frown lines are appearing too and my skin is no longer at its best.\n\nI have just resolved to continue taking care of my skin and hair as it is, just with a bit more effort. \n\nJust make the best of it is all we can do.", "YTA- some women do take ageing harder than others. She was crying and you basically told her to stop being ridiculous.

And I\u2019m sure many men will sympathize with your situation! Lol", "Genetics are weird and grey hair doesn't mean old and dark hair doesn't mean young. My mom's family goes white in their teens/twenties. Because I'm physically a lot like my mother I was resigned to going white young. So of course it turned out I got my dad's family genetics of barely going grey. Almost 60 and I'm less than 20% grey. I'm less grey than my younger siblings. I'm even less grey than my oldest nephew. It's just the way the genetics fell out.", "See, this right here!  I got my first grey hair when I was SIX, for heavens sake. And let me tell ya, I was steaming mad when my Mama pulled it out, I was proud of it! So it can happen at any age.\n\nThere's gotta be something more to it. At a guess, she may be worried about her attractiveness as she ages. I know my mom did that as she started graying up. Funny thing about that was, my mom hit the jackpot-- her hair turned from dull brown to this really pretty cross between ash blonde and honey. You better believe I teased her about all the fretting she did!\n\nNTA, but maybe subtly point out how pretty silver foxes are, wink wink.", "She has a therapist! We like healthy mental health here", "Thank you!", "Was being called dude, \"us women feel\".. it makes it known that I have similar upbringing and understand a woman's struggle.", "Oh and plenty of folks on here think I'm  an AH so don't worry lol.", "That.... Is not sweet. I would walk if I was upset about something to the point of ugly crying and my SO decided to mock and laugh.", "Oo hard facts", "Cheers", "I did mention this. I'm letting it settle for a few days as I have not brought it up at all on our 2 days off. Knowing her I don't think she is quite ready for that. \n\nShe also brought up her sister, and this part I did get her to giggle a bit..\n\nShe said her sister is 6 years older and has no gray hair...\n\nI said... \"your sister throws botox parties, lives in a million dollar house and she is blonde, you can't see them...\"", "I'm excited something you can only do once,  what a treat", "When she hit 30 there was a lite bit but this was a lot.

Just.. ahhhh *falls on fainting couch*", "Also,  same..", "She seems fine.  This was Monday night?  The last 2 days she was fine,  had cramps and felt poopy but fine. \n\nYesterday we snuggled and played games all day.  I don't think I ever got dressed... she didn't either. .. and it was typical,  lots of love yous and squeezes.\n\nI know she was talking to her mom FaceTime and her mom pointed it out.  That was the trigger.  I'll ask about it tonight if she seems receptive.", "Beautiful, thick hair with volume I'd kill for... I'm a \"high the hair, closer to god\" kind of girl and lord does it take a lot of product! She can just flip her head over shake it up and instant volume to 11!", "So did she.", "True,  I did Make a pouty face back at her when she brought it up and gave her a forehead smooch.  \n\nWhat's weird is we have talked about mortality before,  in detail. She ran across bridges from snipers as a child.  Heard mortar fire, saw villages destroyed. Her dad died when she was 8, from a car accident. She almost died at 6 from getting hit by a car. Her ex came at her with a knife with intent to harm.  She says she has no fear of death. The woman has been thru so much before she was even 10. \n\nI'll come back to this tonight.  I'll ask her how she is feeling.  I'll update.  Right now she is snoring away lol", "Probably, I want the grays I'm trying to manifest them to be like my mom and her mom... get my matriarch pelt!", "Oh when I cried she let me have my moment then told me enough.  Just the same.  Except she sounds more like this, \"omg stfu, god forbid you can see now and not crash the car.\"\n\nDeadass.. not hypocritical at all.\n\nI was anxious to fly for the first time with her, and I stayed up all night freaking out.

I remember my sister, who\u2019s 9 years older than I am, hit 30 and was super depressed. She felt like she hadn\u2019t accomplished anything in her life. I had to stop her and remind her that not only did she escape a shitty marriage but raised her daughter, who was 10 at the time, finished a nursing and psychology degree at the same time, and was working a stable job and started seeing someone that was really good to her and my niece. \n\nI don\u2019t remember what my problem was at 30 but I remember being down but then I met my husband. \n\nAt 40 I felt great. I\u2019m young enough to do stuff and old enough to have the cash to do it. \n\nNow to get back to my art career.", "I started going grey (shocking white) at 16. I dye my hair a lot because I\u2019m pale and have very dark eyebrows and I\u2019m not trying to look like a Targaryen. My brother and sister, like you have taken after the other side and are unlikely to go grey until very late in life. \n\nGenetics are indeed funny like that. \n\nThough, I do understand the pressure and shock at ageing that people can feel. It\u2019s probably less about the grey hair itself and more about the getting older. It will pass. \n\nMy thirties have been the best decade of my life so far, makes me excited for the coming ones.", "It didn\u2019t work if all it did was get her to silently resent you. If it had worked, she would feel better, not worse.", "Then either she isn't seeing her therapist frequently enough or the therapist isn't doing a good job of helping her deal with gray hair. Just let your wife know I'm 51 (soon to be 52) years old and I don't have a gray hair yet and that gets me angry. I don't color my hair and I want gray hair.", "I think the difference might be that we watch the other person\u2019s reaction first. I\u2019ve chuckled at people walking into walls - after they themselves started laughing. \n\nIn potentially upsetting / embarrassing situations, it\u2019s better to observe and if relevant, mirror or react accordingly. If your point is that you want her to be happy, then try to respect her wishes. Perhaps she just wants to rant and cry. Let her have at it. That would probably be a more supportive thing to do.\n\nFWIW, I\u2019m also a woman whom people regard as unemotional, etc. Have even been teased for it before. I may not always understand, but I\u2019ve learnt to better express empathy by picking up cues from others over the years. Very doable.", "\u201cWas being called a dude\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s my point isn\u2019t it? - you were being called a guy, or assumed to be a guy, so sought to change the vote or change people\u2019s opinions of you by clarifying you were a woman. \n\nThe underlying message being \u2026if you are a woman\u2026 what you said might have been more okay? I\u2019m just pointing out there is something wrong with that and I saw a similar edit a few days ago also by a woman looking to convince people.\n\nDoes that seem fair?\n\nI actually don\u2019t think you\u2019re the arsehole here. A bit mean maybe considering but some people just have a better coping mentality for things. The reality is getting old is something we all need to accept eventually it is possible to say \u201cdeal with it it\u2019s a part of life\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re never as young as you are right now\u201d in a way which is a bit softer for her maybe.\n\nI mean if she keeps carrying on for years give her a verbal \u201cslap\u201d but she wouldn\u2019t be the first one to have a moment of sadness due to life\u2019s harshest reality - we dyin\u2019", "OP, please clarify what being in a war has to do with hair changing color.

I'd just say despite all that, the fear of the ticking clock running out on us and it suddenly feeling closer, out of the blue, can sneak up from nowhere and be a very consuming thought. \n\nHope everything settles for you both tho!", "Easy to say, but I've yet to meet anyone who felt that way and I'm now 60", "Haha, my first ever one was spotted by my boyfriend while in bed, he plucked it out with his fingers.

Especially that grey hair + laugh lines look on soft, older skin - makes a person look distinguished, experienced, and fun. And not in a pervy way, just in a 21 year olds aren't the only kind of good looking people way. \n\nI fully embrace that our culture is youth obsessed and gross in that regard, and that my preference isn't everyone's preference, but I think embracing the greys is the best thing an aging person can do.", "i honestly think my wife's grey streaks look hot. \n\ni mean she does look hot with her hair dyed, but i think it's hot either way. \n\nmaybe i just like my wife.", "I got a few grey strands in my 30s, didn\u2019t see them multiply much.

She brought it up because your reaction to her is still bothering her-hence, resentment. It seems you just came here to argue, not to receive advice. You\u2019re not her parent. You don\u2019t get to decide if her feelings are valid. This seemed like a simple miscommunication when I first read it. Your replies, however, seem condescending and arrogant.

She hasn't felt good on our days off and literally hasn't  had to lift a finger. \n\nIn key communication, one of the biggest reasons couples feel resentment is that they feel their feelings are not validated. I didn't give her permission to have those feelings, I validated that they are real. I heard her and understood them, even related to them in some degree.. maybe like a 3 to her 8. \n\nI also, never asked for advice, I asked if I was an ass in that situation. \n\nEvery relationship is different. We both divorced horrible, abusive exs. Trust me if she felt I was being too much, she will let me know. She isn't some delicate flower. Don't have to worry about her.", "Hey, we are going to disagree thats cool. \n\nI wasn't making it better for just me either, it was for the both of us. I didn't invalidate how she felt.
