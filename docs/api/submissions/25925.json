But it's a very valid thing to be upset about. It's not vanity. Youth and beauty for women is a social currency. Women who look visibly older, such as having gray hair, are treated worse in the world. Of course it's upsetting to be treated worse, seen as worth less because of your age and how you look. It IS upsetting. Your wife's feelings are valid. You are being insensitive because you're younger. Sure, there's not much to be done about aging. So you might as well not get upset, and accept what you can't change. But we live in a cruel world that tells women their value is wrapped up in their appearance and youth. So when you lose that \"value,\" of course it feels bad! Obviously appearance shouldn't have anything to do with a person's worth, but that's not how we're treated. There are tangible, real-world consequences to looking older like discrimination, but we act like women are stupid or vain to care about their looks.\n\nAll you can do is let your wife feel her feelings and try to be supportive. It's ok to tell her you think she's beautiful and aging doesn't matter to you, but don't diminish her feelings. It's not going to help. She's mourning her youth which may sound silly to you but it's not. And it's a painful process of acceptance she just has to go through.", "NAH \n\nhi!\ni started getting gray hairs at 18 and it took me three more years to realize the stress was coming from inside the house(\u26a0\ufe0f)\n\nYou tried your best, it sounds like your wife is bouncing between her insecurities about her image and maybe her mortality\n\nReminding her you're there in sickness and in health, through browns grays and yellows, will continue to help you both \ud83d\udc95\n\nBest of luck OP", "The real question is why are all these women editing in that they are women as if it changes anything?\n\nLike - if you were a man you\u2019d be an arsehole but if you\u2019re a lady/lesbian then it\u2019s \u201call good haha NTA lol\u201d\n\nDouble standards of our western society on show perhaps?!", "Ok just a little more description.... at first she was very upset yes, palpable.

This society does not want us to embrace aging since women literally pay billions of dollars year to try to look younger. \nI have a friend like this, always comparing herself and jealous of younger women.
