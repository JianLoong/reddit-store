I listened to her for a few minutes.  She compared herself to me not having many grays.  I showed her that I do indeed have them. She asked me if I noticed how gray she is. Now,  we don't lie to one another so I said,  \"you have beautiful,  thick hair and yes I have noticed,  I love it!\". \n\nShe was inconsolable. \n\nAt one point as she was sobbing about looking like an old hag, I chuckled. That made her more upset. She said I was patronizing her, but I wasn't.  We have a very humor filled marriage and we can usually laugh at ourselves. All I could think looking at her was, \"my god I love her so much.... what a dumb thing to cry over.\" And the hag part just made me laugh.\n\nI offered her to go to the salon, buy a box dye kit. She was not having it. At about 1am, we had been in bed she was still crying.  She finally got the ,\"Hey, stop it. You can't do anything about it, it's life. Knock it off\".\n\nAITA?

She could try various  dyes too", "NAH\nFor her its big deal, getting older is different for each one of us. Just because you are okay with getting gray hair doesn't mean she is too. You could be more sensitive, especially if you see how deeply she's hurting.", "NAH - it's hard for us women to accept the end of an era sometimes. Did she take those feelings too far? Yeah, probably, but it's normal. Did you get testy about it, yeah, but the frustration was normal too.", "NTA, but I think they might be something more going on? People get grey hair at any age even at 18 and genetics play a part in this. Talk to her and try and find out what is she really upset about?", "Info. When you say \u201cbawling\u201d and \u201ccrying\u201d and \u201cinconsolable\u201d, do you mean the active hard grief crying and that it was going on for hours?", "NSH , it's kinda harsh but i understand you. It's really bothering her a lot. Maybe just sit down and ask what you can do for her.", "Soft YTA, yes, finding these gray hairs is indeed not pleasant, and you chuckling over it didn't make the situation better. That you find these gray hairs adorable has no bearing on what HER emotional reaction is. Is it vain on her side? Absolutely. Is it a reason to laugh? Hell no.", "I would say you are insensitive. We are taught as women that the most value we will ever have is when we are very young. Your wife is young but according to a lot of losers her \u201cbest by date\u201d is gone. They are wrong, but it is still anxiety provoking. There is grief there. This isn\u2019t just about her hair. So YTA, even though you didn\u2019t mean to be.\n\nEdit: (I think what I said applied even if you are a women too. Some people power through it. Some ppl really got that diatribe pushed into their psyche).\n\nYou may be able to comfort her by telling her how many twenty year olds get gray and white hair.", "i mean, you could have reacted a bit more empathetically. esp if this is the first time? yta, a bit.", "YTA she obviously needed compassion not tough love", "Of course NTA, you were very sweet and showed her how much you care about her.

At some point we all die.\u201d And then probably some joke so that I\u2019d get how childish I behaved. ;)\nSometimes you need humor because life can be ridiculous. You sound like a wonderful, supportive wife to your wife. Best of luck to you two :)", "NAH here, though you could probably have been a bit gentler about it at the end of the first night ? When someone's overcome with emotions, they can't just \"knock it off\", no matter how small their motives may seem from the outside. \n\nAs a lesbian in my late thirties, if I may, I'd like to add that grey hair can be super classy and attractive. Maybe she could look at it the other way round, when she's ready : sure there are ways to hide them, but they can also be embraced and look fabulous.", "NAH. I hesitate to call her an AH for having a existential crisis, she might have taken being the younger partner as part of her identity and might be freaking out that it's not as obvious anymore.

I'm a 36 yo woman too and I started getting some white strands. To me it's like 'heh. White.' \nI know others, however, who have had full meltdowns. It's probably some flavour of existential crisis, but to me it's difficult to understand properly because it just IS. \nBut I'm also a bit Hakuna-Matata yknow.\nWhen that's said, I try to be compassionate, and it sounds like you tried as well, but at some point wallowing in it becomes destructive and it might seem a bit assholeish, but we all need a little push sometimes not to get stuck on the details.", "Wow.  Yes, YTA.  This is \\*very obviously\\* bothering her a lot, and you took none of it seriously at all.", "Dude, it's not about her getting older. Something else is bothering her and that was just her breaking point.

This felt like a big deal to her, and she needed your support and reassurance.", "NTA.  But often women have a hard time with evidence of aging.  I, however, started turning gray at 15, had to start coloring at 20 and was 100% gray at 35.   Color is your friend!", "YTA Finding gray is a big deal for some people and clearly was for her. I had very dark hair and when it started going gray (also early 30s) it was really hard to see because it made a big difference in my overall appearance.

Kinda like when someone falls over and you laugh.", "She was gray at 26 when we met.... its just more now.\n\nAlso her best by date has a wedding ring on it.  F anyone else's opinion. This is how she normally is. So it was odd. \n\nI feel like my little blunt poke snapped her back to reality. She has been haha normal fine since.

We are very communicative.  There is a text limit to posting lol. \n\nShe was talking to her mother eariler that day.  My wife is an immigrant from Bosnia.

You laughed instead.", "YTA. \n\nI know you meant that as a thing to solve the issue, but you were not informing your wife about anything. Box dye kits an beauty parlors?

Could be worse, I got my dad's nose.\n\nJust keep telling her that it's *her* you love, so very much, whatever color the hair. ..could also be hormones making her a bit less able to rein in that existential dread of getting older and adulting. \n\nWhen I started going gray it was my opportunity to try out some different, brighter colors for my hair.. if her job allows it maybe that would appeal to her.\n\nNAH", "Of course not.

This was night before last, we had 2 days off together and enjoyed a weekend at home. She brought it up last night and pouted for a minute, that was it.", "Thats fine, do rest.", "LOL!!

My advice as an oldie is wear a hat and or sunscreen if you want to look less old, when you are!   :)", "Thankfully up here in the PNW we don't get much sun. \n\nThis vanity i feel came out of left field as well.
