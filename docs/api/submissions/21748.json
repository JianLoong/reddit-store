We all know it's an insult. He's playing head games.", "ESH.\n\nYour relationship with your parents is no where near as good as you think it is.  Your mother sounds like abusive to you in your childhood and even now if you have to walk on eggshells.  You are constantly wondering how she is going to react to a benign text from your boyfriend.  She, at minimum, sounds like she either has control issues or is very, very anxious.. but it's more about control and manipulation by the sound of it.\n\nIronically you are being just as controlling to your boyfriend as your mother has been to you.  \n\nYour mother sounds like she could do with some therapy but she likely has no insight and doesn't think she is the problem.  She'll blame everyone else for that.. and probably you the most.\n\nBut I would suggest that you get some therapy so that you are less anxious and also allow you to unpack your upbringing and childhood as well as your relationship with your mother and father and make some strategies about moving forward with that.\n\nYou are not responsible for your mothers feelings. You cannot control what she she says, thinks or does.  You can only control your response to her.\n\nYour boyfriend needs to stop texting your parents at all.  You need to rethink what sort of relationship you want with them.  If they won't change you either have to accept what they are like and deal with the uncomfortableness of it and the fact you can never relax.  Or you do something to help protect you (your mental health) and that might be minimising the time you spend with them and thinking about what you tell them about what you are doing.\n\nWhat's your sister like?  Is she the golden child that can do no wrong and you are just trying to get your mother to love you as much as she loves your sister?  Or does she keep away from your mother because she's protecting herself because she understands she can't fix her and also that she's not obligated to her.\n\nYour boyfriend has obviously hit a nerve with is anal comment.  That's probably reflected in your childhood, or something about your mother.  It's a common turn of phrase in many places and many would just laugh at the description even if it was about them.  Some would even be proud of it because it says that they are organised and meticulous.  But it can have a negative consequence where things need to be controlled and done to the letter of the law or you can't move forward.\n\nYou may be far better off nurturing relationships with the people that make you feel good about yourself and your relationship with your boyfriend.  They may be your friends and/or his family.  If your family make you feel bad about yourself, you don't have to subject yourself to their presence as all it does is make you cranky which you may take out on your boyfriend.\n\nYou are controlling and it's not a good look over this situation.  Your boyfriend is brushing off how upset you are over this.  But you both have to look deeper as to why this is such a bone of contention and how much your family is affecting you and how you interact with your boyfriend.", "You\u2019re both kinda wrong, but him more than you \n\nFirst of all, \u201canal\u201d is short for anal retentive \n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean careful and precise but it is synonymous with other personality traits\u2026 which could definitely be construed as more negative \n\n\nhttps://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-an-anal-personality-5073867#:~:text=The%20concept%20of%20the%20anal,as%20part%20of%20psychoanalytic%20theory.\n\n\nThat being said you\u2019re also making a big deal out of nothing", "YTA, lightly. Anal is a colloquial way of describing someone high strung. Per your specific question, it is \"something common that you shouldn't have been (that) upset or bothered by\".\n\nYou explained you were upset and bothered by it. But then it seems like your major complaint is that he seemed confused why you would be so upset about it. You don't write that he continued to say you were being anal about it. So this can be a \"agree to disagree\" thing. Ultimately the very crucial thing is if he continues to use \"anal\" to describe this or not. If he continues that then he's a massive asshole. If he doesn't use that word anymore to describe it, and this is just a N A H disagreement about how colloquial that word is.", "But you ARE being anal. Maybe you should reflect rather than be mad at the messenger.", "You guys should go your separate ways while you can. Your life will get better once you find someone you can mesh with. \n\nWhen you're in the right relationship, you'll not feel the need to post silly ass questions to ppl on reddit.", "ESH \nIt is negative but you are being anal about this and also anal about this whole situation.", "YTA - you making such a big deal about him using the word anal because you would prefer other words that are similar is the perfect example of you being anal. \n\nJust let the man express himself how he wishes, you understand that he\u2019s a little \u201cblunt\u201d (though I don\u2019t think telling your partner their anal is all that blunt) and so therefore you should inquire if how he means it instead of policing his word choices. It\u2019s okay to restrict his communication with your parents due to this, but he\u2019s your partner who deserves equal communication, not to be told off. You sound incompatible.", "YTA,....its a word and one that apparently applies. You seem very childish and controlling. The use of the word may be not be to your liking or flattering, but it seems perfectly used.", "NAH \n\nIts shorthand for anal rententive, hes not literally calling you an asshole or anything", "The fact you're posting on line about him describing you as anal does make you seem pretty anal. \n\nProbably not the best word to describe you but at the same time the description fits.\n\nLooking at the conversation he's clearly thought the word wouldn't cause insult so I'm going for a soft YTA.\n\nYou should properly try to be a little bit less anal.", "NTA. The negative connotations are widely accepted. \n\nSynonyms would be finicky, pedantic, rigid, fussy. None of which are positive. While careful and precise may be traits associated with someone\u2019s anal behaviour, it\u2019s taken to be to a degree which makes that behaviour a negative attribute. \n\nHe should be fully aware of the words he chooses, or he should not use them. Chances are he _is_ aware and he\u2019s doing it to annoy you, in which case you should use whichever synonym for asshole you feel is suitable. Feel free to utilise your vocabulary appropriately.", "YTA. If you don't like the word maybe don't continue to behave in a way where that word applies.", "So you are punishing your bf for your parents reactions to constantly misinterpreting his texts?\n\nWould you prefer the word controlling?", "YTA you are literally being anal about being anal.", "Look, you're definitely NTA. But this is definitely an anal response to the situation.", "Let's say that the word perfectly defines your personality and u get irritated as u don't want to accept it", "YTA.\n\nYou are being anally retentive. He is pointing that out.\n\nIf you don\u2019t like the message, don\u2019t look at him, look at a mirror.", "I can see that this is going to be down voted, but I don't see how you not wanting your boyfriend to text your parents that you have a complex relationship with without talking to you is so controlling? Idk, I've been with my partner for 7 years and we each handle contact with our respective families ourselves. It doesn't sound like he's somehow super close to them, so what does he want from them that has to exclude you? Idk, I love my boyfriends family, but don't really see a reason to have my own separate communication with them. \n\nAlso, let's not pretend anal is a super neutral word :D it has quite a few meanings and only one of them is talking about being very careful and precise. Using a sexual term like that is for sure not as innocent as everyone tries to make it sounds. I would also find it disrespectful. In any case, even if it was innocent, once you said that it bothers you, he should stop using it. NTA", "\"I'm very strict about ..\"\n\nSeriously?\n\nThat statement alone gets you ATA.", "But I mean, you are being anal. \n\nIt's a descriptive word and you fit the description, you might not like it and that's fine, but it doesn't change the fact that you are anal.", "NTA. He\u2019s being deliberately snide and doubling down on it. Not good.", "It is insane to me that you'd use 'mad' as a synonym for 'angry', and then argue semantics for a word you think of poorly, I feel like there's an imbalance in the relationship, to be honest. In the interest of fairness though, if he does insult you, you shouldn't have to take it, though I don't think it was some grave sin in this scenario. You are not the ar\\*ehole, but I cannot enjoy your grammar... and I'm sorry for that.", "NTA. It's a simple, honest request and your BF should honor your wishes. Really doesn't matter if it's a synonym, overreaction, whatever.", "YTA\n\nYoure being very anal about this topic. Relax", "NTA. I used to call my husband anal (about the way he does projects) and he called me out on it. So I stopped. \n\nNow, instead of calling him anal, I praise him for being meticulous and his efforts to do things right. \n\nReally isn't hard.", "NTA, while you could probably be a bit more lenient with your boyfriend texting your parents, he really shouldn\u2019t be texting them without you knowing anyways. just the same as you with his. (minus like surprises) there are also better words to use than anal and even if he still didn\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t like it, he still knew that you didn\u2019t and still proceeded to call you it even after you told him to stop. that\u2019s where i think you need to look. not the word itself but the fact that he doubled down multiple times AFTER you explained you didn\u2019t like that description.\ni think therapy would benefit you greatly when it comes to how to handle your mother. i know what it\u2019s like to have a controlling parent and to constantly walk on eggshells around them only makes things harder for you. with therapy, you\u2019ll be able to learn how to properly handle situations with your mom when she starts to act out while also having a safe person to vent to. good luck OP!\n\nedit: word", "This is only gonna address your BF using that specific word, not about your parents since that seems like a whole different situation.\n\n**NTA** because it seems like he's taking your wishes very lightly and not getting the message. Yes, the communication seemed a bit heated but only because he's defensive over a word that could be said and communicated to you in different ways as well.", "YTA. He used that word to tell you that you were being overly controlling of the language he uses to talk to your parents and you responded by trying to control what language he uses to talk to you. \n\nI'm sorry but you are being anal. You don't like having that word applied because of it's negative connotations but it is the correct word to describe your behaviour, being a controlling person is negative. You don't like being described that way then stop being that way.", "ESH. \n\nHe should apologize for hurting your feelings, whether he meant to hurt them or not. But you should apologize for being controlling, too. No clear AH, hence, ESH.", "NTA. He knows it\u2019s negative and is an asshole.", "Writing an AITA post about the accuracy and connotations of the word 'anal' isn't far off the definition of the word 'anal.'\n\nYTA.", "Meh. NTA\n\nIf someone tells me that they don't like to be called something, then I'm going to not call them that thing. This was a dumb argument. There wasn't any ill-intent, so he didn't even need to apologize. Just respect her wish and move on\n\nHe's blunt but can't understand that you don't like something? Some people just need to be right, I guess", "well honestly you do come across as anal and yes you did overreact YTA", "Seven years and you can\u2019t even trust him to talk to your parents? NTA", "My abusive ex did the same mind games about calling me a snowflake because I didn't want to watch r\\*pe on movies. I'm not going to jump to any conclusions but if he really cannot understand it then I'd be wondering if he's really that stupid or if he is doing it on purpose. \"Anal\" is generally an insult; you aren't an a-hole for not wanting to be insulted by a loved one.\n\nI do also question this need to control everything he sends though. I wanna say ESH.", "I kinda agree with him, it\u2019s seems pretty anal to need to closely monitor your boyfriend of 7 years texts to your parents. And it has negative connotations likely because your boyfriend finds it annoying, or at least I would. But on the other hand asking him not to use a certain word to describe you is fair and should be respected regardless of how accurate the word seems to be. NTA", "YTA", "Nta, he just doesnt want to admit he made you upset and has to apologize. Dude needs to mature a little.", "NAH\n\nAnal has a negative connotation so he is wrong/being disingenuous to pretend otherwise, but its an incredibly minor criticism to be annoyed at - I think the issue here is probably something beneath this dispute, right", "NTA:\n\nThe BF needs to learn to be careful with his word choices by researching meanings of words before he types. Besides OP probably has strict parents.", "YTA. You're just mad that the word describes exactly who you are. You ARE anal retentive. You're \n just mad because you don't want to admit its true.

When she receives texts, there can usually be a chance that she would misinterpret them and use it against the person. There have been occasions in the past where my boyfriend has texted them without letting me know. There was usually a 50/50 chance of the things he said to be completely fine. The other 50% had her texting me angrily, causing me to have to mediate the situation. Its usually small things that set her off. \nIts very annoying, for both of us to deal with.

He went too far and should apologise for it, which is the sh\\*tty part of his in this scenario, but I can kind of see how he got there. That's all."]}
