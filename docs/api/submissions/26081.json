My husband had a serious surgery on his hip just a few weeks prior to my delivery. So for the first month post-partum, I was pretty much stuck doing everything by myself as he was still recovering and had a lot of pain. That month was HELL, didn\u2019t get much help from anyone as my mom works all the time.\n\nAfter that first month post-partum passed, my husband started getting better and stepping up with the baby. \n\nNow for context as far as my FIL goes, my husband doesn\u2019t have a great relationship with him. He cheated and neglected my MIL (as in, would go out for days at a time to get drunk with his friends, leaving her with 2 babies and no money for groceries) when husband was baby, to the point were my MIL took both her kids and flew back to her home country. It was a whole drama as FIL did not consent to it, but he always refused to pay child support. He told my MIL she needs to come back or will get nothing from him. Anyway, this is a short version, but it gives you an idea of the family dynamic. FIL still cared enough for his children that when they reached 18, he proposed they go live with him and study in his country as it has better opportunities. The relationship improved but the trauma remained unadressed. \n\nNow back to present day. FIL visited us and passed odd comments, that I thought were jokes at first. My husband, since he feels better, changed most diapers and does more than his share to let me recover from the month I had to endure. His dad picked up on that and would pass comments like \u201cmen are not supposed to work in the house and change diapers\u201d. Tbh I was too tired to pay attention to it, but it still caught my attention. \nA few days later, Im out for dinner with my girlfriends, he calls my husband and husband casually mentioned it. FIL tells him I should stay home and be a mother. (My husband has this strategy where he just ignores his stupid comments and lives his life however he wants).\nSome time later we see them at their place for a bbq, he finds a way to mention that only women change diapers etc. I kinda snapped and told him \u201cis this the 50s? Also, knowing your family history, we\u2019ll hold off from taking you as a parenting role model\u201d. \n\nHe turned red, left the table and been giving the silent treatment since. \n\nSo am I an asshole for pushing what I know to be a painful button?", "created_utc": 1693694411, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168g5sr/aita_for_telling_my_misogynistic_fil_that_he_is/", "score": 219, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He totally deserved it honestly, and its also not what you want to show your kid. He might be too young for now, but I doubt that FIL will stop his bullshit just as time passes by. You absolutely need those boundaries.\nThe fact that he goes no contact, maybe you need to wonder if it's not what's best for your family anyways and he's just doing you a favor; but I understand that your partner might want to keep a relationship with him no matter the trauma. \nWishing you all the best!", "NTA.  And what a great result.  The best possible result is to get your FIL to Stfu.  Congratulations. Now you know how to shut him up any time.\n\nHere's some more for when he says your husband shouldn't be a partner to you.\n\nNo, he should be out getting shitfaced and fucking anything that moves.\n\nNo, he should leave us for days with no food or money.\n\nNo, he should be a deadbeat and leave his family with nothing.\n\nNo, he should stumble through life, caring for no one and looking down on everyone who is above him. In other words, everyone. \n\nI'm sure you can think of more.\n\nMaybe print them on individual business cards so you can just hand him one.  Call them Shut The Fuck Up cards.  Guess what FIL, you just earned another card!", "NTA - Never ever would you be in the wrong for this. He got the public embarrassment that is mild compared to what he deserves.", "NTA. Excellent comeback btw.", "NTA but your husband should really step up and deal with his dad. \n\nThe 50s comment was absolutely perfect and I guess the truth hurts.", "> I kinda snapped and told him \u201cis this the 50s?

He FA'ed and FO'ed.\n\nEnjoy the silent treatment while it lasts, because the longer he keeps it up the less stupidity will enter your life.", "NTA.  I find it hilarious!", "I mean, it got him to shut it and mind his own business.  Not your fault he can't handle the truth.  Besides, if he wanted obedience and female oppression, he picked the wrong country to live in.", "Nta he got what he deserved", "NTA.

REALLY?!?\" \ud83d\ude02", "NTA.\n\nHe's been insulting you both, provoking and poking at your choices and decisions, for a while.  He's been setting himself up as if he's the expert, and as if he has a right to tell you how to live.\n\n**You reacted with the truth,** that he's not an expert and you won't be taking his advice because his experience belies the advice.  That's reasonable.  \n\nThere are a lot of old proverbs about dishing it out and not being able to take it.  They all apply to this.\n\n***You didn't push any of his buttons that were any less painful than the rudeness he's been pushing your way for a while now.***  \n\nHe's giving the silent treatment, because that's how manipulators work.  It's to punish you for standing up to him, and it's manipulative behavior he's doing right now.  It's also to make you feel guilty and question yourself.  **People like your FIL want the ones that stand up to them to stop standing up to them, to learn never to do that again.**  He might even expect you to apologize to him for having the strength to object to his mean comments that continually undercut your decisions.  \n\nYou didn't do wrong.  He's been doing wrong to you all along, saying these things.  Normal people, called out this way, would be self aware enough to apologize to you for their mistreatment of the two of you.  He's trying to avoid being held responsible for his own misbehavior.   **You do not have anything to apologize for here.  He does.**", "NTA\n\nSounds like a win-win for you!  He can keep his archaic comments to himself.", "NTA!! Fool around and find out. 10 points from the American judge.", "NTA. He was throwing stones from a very fragile glass house.", "NTA. I'm the youngest of five, by several years. The first grandchild was born in 1967 when I was about 7\u00bd. The next youngest sibling was about 6\u00bd when I was born. I don't know if my dad (born in 1921) changed any of his kids' diapers, but I know he changed his grandchildren's.\n\nTell gramps he is way behind the times. He should stay in his lane. If he wants to have any relationship with your son, he needs to keep his trap shut about archaic gender roles. Otherwise, you're going to be doing a LOT of damage control.", "NTA.  This is what can happen to people who insist on giving unwanted advice.  Hopefully he learns from the experience.", "Babies are so freaking easy.
