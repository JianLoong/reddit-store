So I yelled \"no, you need to tell me what the fuck is going on right now. I deserve to know!\" \n\nThe girl was just like \"what do you think happened. Our friend died and you looked like her.\" And then led her friend away. Everyone else who was outside started whispering and pointing at me, obviously judging me. \n\nI've told my friends and family about this event, and no one is on my side.

It is a personal decision to share your struggles and not your place to ask, even if your walk was interrupted. It seems like this boy is really struggling with the loss of his friend and to take an opportunity to make him feel worse is wrong. There are definitely situations where you just need to mind your own business and when someone is upset or having mental struggles that is one of them (unless they are in danger or putting others in danger) You invaded emotional privacy, but you were also just straight up awful for yelling and cursing at them.

Maybe if Amanda had been an AH, then they would have gotten some sense of nostalgia when interacting with OP. But sounds like Amanda is even more sorely missed now.", "Right? \"You have mistaken me for someone else, so you know what's next. Stand there and tell me everything about the person you thought I was, why you approached me thinking I was them, and the reasons behind your reaction upon learning you were wrong. Come on, you know how this goes, it is my right, so start talking\". \n\nPeople would just stop waving or approaching others on the street altogether. Which I guess introverts would love? But still, it'd be bonkers.", "I don't think so, especially if it happens relatively close to the death. A few months after my friend died I saw someone who looked just like her. I knew it wasn't her but it was startling and kind of fucked my evening up. But in OP's case the kid answered and said \"you look like my friend\". It happens.", "Both my grandfathers died and sometimes I\u2019ll see someone that looks like them and hope that maybe it was all just a nightmare.", "The kid called her Amanda and then the friend said \"Amanda is gone\" most people would have clued in to the fact that, \"Oh, he must have mistaken me for someone else, oh and that someone else has died.\" \n\nIt seems very obvious that if someone calls you by another name, then gets upset when they see that it isn't who they thought, and then you hear someone say the person you were mistaken for is gone, that you were mistaken for someone who died. \n\nI don't see why there would be any confusion there, unless OP has an issue processing social cues and context.", "Then she could have just ignore the person and like you said... mind her own business ?!", "That would be my first worry as well - is this kid okay?  Can I be of help to this other human?  Defiantly not - how dare you disrupt my park walk and speak to me you peasant!  I demand to know why you have intruded upon my time!!! Tell me now or off with your head!!!!!", "If someone interrupts someone else walking, it is common to pay at least 10 bucks for the inconvenience. Some older people  charge an extra 20 bucks, because walking is more difficult for them and getting back to speed takes more time and energy.\n\nAren't you getting payed by crying teenagers when going for a walk?", "Yes I know that that bit is obvious. Like I said though, How do you then begin to understand how the child could've possibly mistaken you for a dead person?\n\nThat's what's confusing and not obvious. Why a child would've even mistaken OP in the first place when the person they're mistaking OP for is dead. It doesn't make sense that the child would even believe in his wildest dreams that OP was the dead person. That's what the confusion is.", "[deleted]", "You gotta pay the Troll Toll...", "When someone we love dies it's really common to see them everywhere in the early stages of grieving. Doesn'tmatter that you know they are dead, that you went to their funeral. Your heart truly sees the beloved person you lost.\n\nTheir general build, the clothes they're wearing, their hairstyle, the way they move.\n\nFor just a moment you really see them, even though you **know** they are gone forever.\n\nAnd I'm talking about adults. How much worse must it be for a child?", "> How do you then begin to understand how the child could've possibly mistaken you for a dead person?\n\nBy being human, capable of experiencing human emotions, and thus comprehending the concept of a young teenager having a non-rational but emotionally powerful reaction to seeing someone they miss dearly, even though they rationally know said someone is dead. \n\nBut beside that, this isn't the point. OP has no need to \"understand\" why the kid mistook her for Amanda or why is he crying about it. Is she Amanda? No. Meaning the kid was mistaken. That's it. Moving on. The teens have no obligation to fulfill OP's strange curiosity about their lives from a seconds-long encounter on the street.", "I guess if you've never lost anyone, you would be confused. But, when you lose someone you were close with, you will see them in other people and for a moment, truly believe it's them when rationally, you know it can't be them. It's a part of grieving. At 15, the kid would act on impulse and approach the person he thought (even though rationally he knew it wasn't) was Amanda. \n\nHonestly, I would think even if she hadn't lost anyone, she's bound to have seen a movie or television show that acted out this type of grief reaction. It's so common that it has become a trope in movies and television.", "Because people's minds play tricks on them? People want to believe that someone they love and miss is still here, and for a second they thought that was the case? Grief isn't rational.\n\nIt doesn't even matter that Amanda is gone. The only bit that OP needs to understand is that they were mistaken for someone else, there's nothing confusing about that.", "... yes ? \n\nI mean... this is a possibility. You can have someone talking to you and just not answer. You can physically do that. \n\nOr you can just say \"wrong person\" and move on. Clearly, they are alternatives that are way better that yelling, cussing, and DEMANDING explanations."]}
