So I yelled \"no, you need to tell me what the fuck is going on right now. I deserve to know!\" \n\nThe girl was just like \"what do you think happened. Our friend died and you looked like her.\" And then led her friend away. Everyone else who was outside started whispering and pointing at me, obviously judging me. \n\nI've told my friends and family about this event, and no one is on my side.

It is a personal decision to share your struggles and not your place to ask, even if your walk was interrupted.

There are definitely situations where you just need to mind your own business and when someone is upset or having mental struggles that is one of them (unless they are in danger or putting others in danger) You invaded emotional privacy, but you were also just straight up awful for yelling and cursing at them.
