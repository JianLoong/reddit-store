In the end the other person is often not worth your blind loyalty; this case is a good example. Infact, this person counted on you tolerating being abused. This is shallow and cruel.  Your view may also be attached to wanting to avoid conflict. No matter what we do, humans cannot avoid this. As a result, read/apply new strategies to respond when someone reacts poorly to your actions/decisions. \n\nYou decided to leave a job. You can only control your actions. When the other party unravels you had choices such as: 1) I'm leaving now due to how you are treating me. 2) I'll stick around in hopes they calm down. etc.....think about other options you could have taken...which ones are best for you? This exercise will allow you more quickly choose your preferred reactions should this occur in the future. This technique is successful in many scenarios. If we visualize and plan our brain is more likely to follow through in the moment. Best to you!", "The entire sub is disappointed in you putting up with this shit, and we will be surely disappointed if you don't find a better job you actually are happy at."]}
