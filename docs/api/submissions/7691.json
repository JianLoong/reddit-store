Diapers and poop reek, and due to potential weight poop and diapers can 'stick' to bins. Which is why many pet owners put a 'poop bag' in last. It also attracts bugs and animals in the outside bin. \n\nThe key difference is that this is unpaid babysitting. If it were paid, who cares and Mom is the AH. But since it isn't paid, she doesn't want to be further inconvenienced with potential bugs, smell, etc. \n\nThe communication would be mom explaining this and having diaper trash bag doubled up, tied tightly, and an explanation that since the trash was just taken and x, y, z can happen, please take it and dispose of it or she (OPs mom) will not want to babysit anymore.\n\nPeople voting YTA see this as 'mom is doing you a great favor and you should accommodate' and I do agree but since its such an unusual ask anyone would be taken aback.", "NTA, this just strikes me as odd.

Ridiculous.\n\nNTA.", "Get them a diaper genie", "NTA. What a bizarre request, and so strange to spring it on you. It\u2019s an outside bin.

In mine we flush the poop down the toilet when possible (exception for newborn poops or runny poops that you can't clear off), then toss diapers onto trash. I'm just confused.", "ESH -ish.

A lot of people suggesting diaper genies but they do not do a great job of keeping the smell out, it\u2019s much better to put the poopy diapers in a plastic bag, tie it, and then take it out to the trash can. I started doing this once my son started eating solid foods and not just formula. Dealing with diapers is part of childcare. I wouldn\u2019t choose this as a hill to die on since they are providing you childcare but it is a weird request.", "NTA.

I watched my grandson for his first two and a half years, maybe 25 hours a week. Which garbage can the poopy diapers went in never came up. Not one time, over thirty five years.

And my dad is crazy about the trash schedule as well. So they tell me it\u2019s fine to leave them, but I can tell it bugs them a bit, so I do take them in the car (in a doggy bag!) and usually throw them out in a trash can near their house (like dog poop) or sometimes even bring them all the way back to our house. I think it\u2019s dumb, but our trash gets taken out 3x per week while my parents\u2019 only get taken out once. Plus my dad seriously has issues with the trash schedule, as in, they have changed vacation times to better match the trash schedule. I think he\u2019s gotten a little quirkier about it with age but it\u2019s not debilitating so I think it\u2019s okay. \n\nAll this to say, I\u2019d rather them continue to be happy to watch my kid, so I\u2019d rather take a poopy diaper off their property and have them not secretly mildly resentful of poop in their garbage can.", "You should have taken it home as they requested when it was already obvious by being placed with the car seat.

Child care is expensive. Some hills are not worth dying on.", "NTA. If you wrap it up and throw it in the OUTSIDE garbage can, I think you're doing more than enough.

A really big one-- 20 hours a week is a big chunk of time. They made an odd request, but not a malicious one.

You should apologize and thank them for all the time and care they put into your family, and then get yourself a little treat for putting up with other people's weird requests.", "NTA you were going to throw it away outdoors. That\u2019s far more reasonable than driving home with poop in the car.", "People are arguing about trash cans being for stinky things in the comments and I will say this- if the outside cans had just been emptied and you put the diaper in, it will sit in the bottom of the can for the week and explode when other items are dumped on top of it, ensuring the crap smell will never go away. Same with dog poop. Bottom of an empty can for a week? Poop smeared hell. Now, if you own a dog or a kid 24/7 you adjust that your cans will always smell of crapola, but your mom wasn't feeling it. \n\nGiven she cares for the child 20 hours a week for free and this is the first time she made this request of you, I would have respected her wishes.

That is not too much to ask.", "When I visited friends with a baby I would just put dirty diapers in my diaper bag to take home trying to be a courteous guest.\nThe fact that they regularly watch your daughter for approximately 20 hours a week regularly threw me though. I mean what do the normally do with the diapers... I guess it was a rare circumstance since their bins had just been emptied, but have they never watched your baby on trash day before.\n\nI would say NTA.

So many were saying someone depositing their bagged dog poo in an outdoor lidded garbage can makes them the asshole. Seriously what? How many people are invested in their outdoor garbage bins like they're eating out of it daily? Once a week you open the lid and hold your breath for 3 seconds, id much rather that than the potential mess that can happen while transporting it, or worse leaving it where it doesn't end up in the garbage. It's all so petty, it's a garbage bin, not your dinner plate", "LOL thank you for this, I'm confused why more people don't find it strange that OP's PARENTS will babysit + change the child, but throwing away 1 diaper in a trash can (which is always gonna be semi-gross because it's a trash can) is where they draw the line? That's so bizarre. Of course it's very kind they offer childcare without a charge, but this is the first time I've ever heard of anything like this lmao", "Would you be ok with other people throwing poop in your trash cans. I bet you don't put your shopping cart back either. YTA", "So you never rinse out your bins.\n\nGross.", "No you've just gotten use to the smell.", "Except you are missing the point.

Ugh!", "Same I genuinely cannot fathom watching my nephew and returning his poopy diapers for my sister to dispose of. It's what outdoor trash cans are for?

She was told no and did it anyway. That makes her an asshole. It's no different than the dick move of tossing dogshit in someone else's trash.

The scenario is ultimately irrelevant. She was asked to respect a boundary and she didn't. That's why she's the asshole.", "This is what I am saying.
