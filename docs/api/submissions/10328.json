It's been amazing seeing so much support! We didn't post an update yesterday since it was Valentine's Day so we're posting it today. We had a family meeting at our house on Monday, and it was interesting.\n\nI started with reminding my dad what he did, how it matched up to all the other times, how it made her and I feel, and how his and my mom's reactions made us feel. I told him that my wife is my everything and what we do, we do together. Our marriage is just as valid. You either want us in your life or you don't and lately your actions have told us the ladder.\n\nThen, I brought up gaslighting. We did some digging the previous night - watched videos and read articles to better understand it. I explained to them what it was, how they did it, and how it made us feel. My conclusion was my reasoning for planning the separate vacation with my wife's family.\n\nMy sister started crying. She apologized for not saying anything and not paying attention. Her husband was upset as well. My sister said \"you have to book a different flight, dad\" to which I pointed out that it was too late - our vacation was already booked and we couldn't bail on it. My sister said \"well then we're not going to Italy, then. You two (mom and dad) can go, but we're not. I feel horrible now.\" Cue argument between parents and my sister. My wife and I sat there with our mouths hung open until my sister + her husband got up and left.\n\n[My suspicions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10z5ieg/comment/j81rvjb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) were right. The reason why my wife and I were being treated unfairly was because of inheritance fears. Their explanation was that they didn't want inheritance \"getting into the wrong hands\" so they wanted to dote on my sister + her husband \"to ensure that it won't\" (their actual words). That right there confirmed everything because they basically said \"yes we treat your sister + her husband better and we're driving it home with the inheritance.\"\n\nIt ended with my parents leaving angry - not at their actions, but the fact that they were getting called out. From this point on, we will be going low contact with my parents and maybe try to amend things between my sister + her husband. We will not attend gatherings/events if one/both of us feel excluded. We will demand that we be treated just as seriously. We now know our boundaries and we will set them. It was a very heartbreaking experience and we were disgusted at the whole thing, we still are. Right now, we just have to take this time to move forward.\n\nI doubt we'll be able to make any more updates beyond this, but again we wanted to thank you all for the advice, love, and support! We truly appreciate it! This was a throwaway but I think I'm going to keep this account up but just not save the login info.

So many queer children are cut from generational wealth advantage just for being queer. What an awful thing to say and do to one of their children. I wish the best for you and your wife. Spend lots of time with her family. They sound great.", "Your bio egg and sperm donors are quite the pieces of work.  Unbelievable.  Id go no contact with them and save your love and allegiance for your in laws.  Never ever let your wife be humiliated by your bios ever again. Never.\n\nGood luck.", "Sadly that didn't help knock some sense into their parents. \n\nThey should invite the sister and husband to things with his wife's family, clearly their parents made their bed.", "Until the inheritance comes up. I doubt they\u2019ll split it equally if not bequeathed. I\u2019ve seen the worst of people surrounding inheritances; tossing family under the bus.", "There are laws in some jurisdictions to prevent it or make it harder, but not enough!", "Great job standing up for yourselves and really happy to hear your sister and her husband are sticking with you. I hope your relationship with them grows. Perhaps your parents will eventually come around, but if not, you have your dignity and your love intact! Good luck to you. Signed, about to celebrate 28 years with my wife.", "Your parents suck. I would tell your sister and her husband about the inheritance and that you are going low contact with your parents. Plan holidays with your sister and her husband and enjoy your family. Not your parents.", "I am glad to hear that your sister was on your side after she heard you out!", "*HUGS* I'm glad things more or less worked out. At least you have your sister on your side and your parents coming around was always a long shot.", "I am so sad that you learned the truth of your fears.\n\nThe inheritance issue are you planning to adopt? have a child by your wife that wouldn't biologically be yours? since you aren't going to update, I'll have to live without knowing LOL.\n\nI'm so glad your sister saw the light and stood up for you.  I do hope going forward that your relationship improves.  \n\nHave a lovely vacation with your In-laws.", "Oof. This hurt. I\u2019m so sorry for what you\u2019re going through. I hope you and your wife come out of this stronger. At the very least, now you know where you rank on your parents list of priorities, and can return the favor.", "> My sister said \"well then we're not going to Italy, then. You two (mom and dad) can go, but we're not. I feel horrible now.\" Cue argument between parents and my sister. My wife and I sat there with our mouths hung open until my sister + her husband got up and left.\n\nwhy does it feel they might change their minds. I say this because i saw a comment of OPs from the og post about how they need more help than OP does.", "Probably sister didn't even notice. They're adults with their own lives and priorities. I don't think OP ever brought it up with her either, so she didn't even know it was happening.", "OP says she doesn't need it anyway, while her sister does. So it wouldn't be the end of the world if it was an uneven split but it'd better at least acknowledge OP properly", "What\u2019s really sad is the parents had no shame admitting it was \u201cabout the inheritance\u201d.  I mean did they think they could exclude the wife and their daughter would never catch on.", "I'm glad your sister and her husband aren't like your parents. You should fill her in on what your parents said after she left. So she knows the kind of people they truly are. \n\n\nTho i hope that wouldn't effect the inheritance to your sister, as you mentioned she and her husband could need it. \n\n\nGood luck with your relationship with sis", "Probably just means the inheritance will skip both you and your sister and go to any bio grandchildren.", ">\"getting into the wrong hands\" so they wanted to dote on my sister + her husband \"to ensure that it won't\" (their actual words). \n\nI'm truly so confused. How does favouring your sister ensure the inheritance goes in the right hands? Inheritance is passed through wills not who love you the most. If they are concerned about having the money continue through generational wealth why not just set up a large fun generically for any bio grandkids? \n\nIf that was their motivation they should be talking to lawyers. Or trying get in your good graces honestly. It doesn't matter how much they have buttered up your sister if you contest the will. It really feels like your parents are full of shit and have primed you to believe this inheritance story", "What country are you in? In the US there are no such laws.  People can cut out their family and leave everything to a goat if they get mad.", "I\u2019m so proud of you. What you and your wife did wasn\u2019t easy, I can\u2019t say enough how proud I am of the both of you. I wish you nothing but love and happiness in your future.", "I call BS on your parents for saying this is mostly about inheritance.\n\nInheritance is after they pass away, not while they are alive. They could definitely treat your wife and you the same.", "I\u2019m in the US which is not the only country in the world\u2026but if you want an example, Arizona doesn\u2019t permit full disinheritance of minor children. Other states allow it but set requirements so you really have to mean it or have kids that meet the right criteria to be excluded. Other examples - France doesn\u2019t allow disinheritance of children and countries like Saudi Arabia follow Islamic law which has set rules for what each child will inherit.", "In Germany for example full disinheritance of children (or a spouse) is pretty hard. You have to have a really solid reason. The example given to me was \"when the child tries to kill you\", so I doubt being lgbtq counts. Not an expert though", "It is not the same at all, but in the UK this week, the high court granted an 83 yo widow half of her husband\u2019s estate as he hadn\u2019t left \u2018reasonable provision\u2019 for her and just left everything to his two sons (and nothing for his four daughters).", "I'm very happy to see your update, OP. Not for the whole outcome, because your parents are still AHs, but for you being able to set boundaries.\n\nI was one of the original commenters, we had a bit of a conversation, I gave you some resources on gaslighting and I'm so happy to see that you understood that you don't have to accept being treated like that. Well done, OP!\nAgain, enjoy your time with your sweet family in law and I'm also happy that you seem to have an amazing sister as well.\nAll the best for you \u2764\ufe0f", "I believe in a comment in the original post, OP said they weren\u2019t planning on having a family at all. The parents fears I think are the inheritance going to a charity (god forbid) and not being passed down the \u201cbloodline.\u201d My guess is the sister is the executor of their will so they\u2019re essentially bribing her to make sure OP doesn\u2019t do anything they\u2019d disapprove of with the money or something, idek. TBH I don\u2019t totally follow their rich person logic and have never fully understood this estate nonsense.\n\nIt\u2019s all very disgusting and I\u2019m shocked they care more about what\u2019ll happen to some dollar bills when they\u2019re 6 ft under than their own daughter\u2019s feelings.", "Probably worried they\u2019d give it to a rainbow flavoured charity \ud83d\ude44", "Her wife x", "In Sweden the inheritance laws are quite strict and it's not possible to remove someone from an inheritance. If you are a step child your rights to inheritance is also protected even if your parent dies first while being married.", ">How does favouring your sister ensure the inheritance goes in the right hands?\n\nMy guess would be they want to make sure sister actually plans to have kids and then that they have access to the kids to make sure they \"grow up right\".", "Our state's law says that the spouse can receive no less than 1/3 of the estate.", "I think Slovakia has this law, which actually really complicated things for me as a UK citizen! Being left 50% of my mum's 50% stake in property meant I owned 25% of a property I hated and never wanted to set foot in. Luckily her husband and I found a lawyer to sort it out, but yeah, it was automatic (possibly because she died intestate).", "I call bullshit on your sister's tears. How could she not notice or see what was happening?", "Whelp - it\u2019s the company not the location! That\u2019s for sure! \n\nSo glad that you and your wife have come through such a test with rock solid relationship \n\nSo sorry you had to go through this devastating alienation with parents \n\nBut very proud of both of you for creating a united married front and defending your boundaries \n\nHave an absolutely wonderful trip with your in-laws - all love to you both!", "Your parents are a product of their generation and parenting but have chosen not to evolve. too bad. Think your sis just had an education and is yoir ally... keep communication open with her. Best of luck for your future.", "I\u2019m sorry your parents are so terrible.  It\u2019s always so sad when parents consider things like inheritance or the family name to be more important than their children.  But I\u2019m glad to hear that you still have a friend in your sister and her husband.  Best of luck with everything in the future!", "Iirc Brazil have well built laws about it. Most a parent can cut their children inheritance just by will is to 25% (to be split with all the children). You can only cut them out in cases of violence towards family members or sexual relationships with stepmom/dad (as far as I remember but also not an expert)", "Correct. There is a percentage you almost never can exclude them from.", "Upvoting this comment just for \"I'm in the US which is not the only country in the world. \"\n\nBTW,  I'm also in the US.", "How are your hands the \"wrong hands\"?  That's confusing to me.  Are they supposedly punishing you because you're gay?  That's all on them and their loss.", "It\u2019s a sense of fresh air to see a couple who stand up to there family. I read so many stories of staying quiet, going along, for the peace of the family, for the sake of the family", "Good for you! Plan a nice long weekend with your sister and her husband. Spend time just your two little families.", "I\u2019m so happy your sister saw the light and I\u2019m so sorry your parents behaved that way. I have been excluded from family trips in the past because \u201cit was just easier this way\u201d and I cannot tell you how terrible I felt. Being excluded from family trips - be it yourself or your wife-  is one of the most lonely and sad feelings and then to read the homophobia with their response on the inheritance is just beyond cruel. I hope you both have the best time on your cabin trip", "Thank you for saying this. I couldn\u2019t understand why on earth OP\u2019s parents would make a distinction between them and her sister and husband for a minute. Whew, homophobia is wild.", "My mother never approved of being homosexual or bisexual. Her favorite cousin was gay. We spent more time with him than anyone else in the family. When they were still having parties, they invited him and he always showed up with his boyfriend. His boyfriend was never asked to leave and was always given the same treatment as the straight couples there. I have a very long memory. This was happening when I was 2-4. I don\u2019t remember when I was 2 but I do at 3 & 4. I am glad I can remember back that far because it gave me a very valuable tool. I don\u2019t need to approve of something to be decent and I don\u2019t need to be the one judging. He knew she didn\u2019t approve and he never let that affect things either. I am most grateful for their example. I will never have to choose between my approval and those that mean the world to me. I can coexist very lovingly beside anyone no matter their choices. Nobody else in my world has ever shown me that besides them. More people need to have people like them in their families!", "Something similar in Finland. Half of the inheritance is reserved for direct descendants by law.", "I'm not buying it. Nothing is preventing them from making a will that explicitly leaves everything to your sister or her children. That's not a reason to exclude you and your wife. It seems like they are trying to hide their homophobia behind a false rational argument.", "So glad your sister has your back", "There are multiple states that do have these laws, especially if the surviving spouse is not the parent.", "Yes, when I read the original post, I just did not get it (the parents\u2019 attitude.) Their other daughter was married\u2026.Then I re-read and saw the OP was also female. Light bulb! I was a bad Kitty and failed reading comprehension.\n\nOP, I hope you and your wife have a wonderful time at the cabin, and that you can mend your relationship with your sister.", "Yeah in Italy I know it's hard, if not impossible to disinherit a child.", "For minor children. I'm referring to adult children in the US.", "But is your US the only country in the world?"]}
