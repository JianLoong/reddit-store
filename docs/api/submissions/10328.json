It's been amazing seeing so much support! We didn't post an update yesterday since it was Valentine's Day so we're posting it today. We had a family meeting at our house on Monday, and it was interesting.\n\nI started with reminding my dad what he did, how it matched up to all the other times, how it made her and I feel, and how his and my mom's reactions made us feel. I told him that my wife is my everything and what we do, we do together. Our marriage is just as valid. You either want us in your life or you don't and lately your actions have told us the ladder.\n\nThen, I brought up gaslighting. We did some digging the previous night - watched videos and read articles to better understand it. I explained to them what it was, how they did it, and how it made us feel. My conclusion was my reasoning for planning the separate vacation with my wife's family.\n\nMy sister started crying. She apologized for not saying anything and not paying attention. Her husband was upset as well. My sister said \"you have to book a different flight, dad\" to which I pointed out that it was too late - our vacation was already booked and we couldn't bail on it. My sister said \"well then we're not going to Italy, then. You two (mom and dad) can go, but we're not. I feel horrible now.\" Cue argument between parents and my sister. My wife and I sat there with our mouths hung open until my sister + her husband got up and left.\n\n[My suspicions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10z5ieg/comment/j81rvjb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) were right. The reason why my wife and I were being treated unfairly was because of inheritance fears. Their explanation was that they didn't want inheritance \"getting into the wrong hands\" so they wanted to dote on my sister + her husband \"to ensure that it won't\" (their actual words). That right there confirmed everything because they basically said \"yes we treat your sister + her husband better and we're driving it home with the inheritance.\"\n\nIt ended with my parents leaving angry - not at their actions, but the fact that they were getting called out. From this point on, we will be going low contact with my parents and maybe try to amend things between my sister + her husband. We will not attend gatherings/events if one/both of us feel excluded. We will demand that we be treated just as seriously. We now know our boundaries and we will set them. It was a very heartbreaking experience and we were disgusted at the whole thing, we still are. Right now, we just have to take this time to move forward.\n\nI doubt we'll be able to make any more updates beyond this, but again we wanted to thank you all for the advice, love, and support! We truly appreciate it! This was a throwaway but I think I'm going to keep this account up but just not save the login info.

So many queer children are cut from generational wealth advantage just for being queer. What an awful thing to say and do to one of their children. I wish the best for you and your wife. Spend lots of time with her family. They sound great.", "Your bio egg and sperm donors are quite the pieces of work.  Unbelievable.  Id go no contact with them and save your love and allegiance for your in laws.  Never ever let you wife be humiliated by your bios ever again. Never.\n\nGood luck.", "Sadly that didn't help knock some sense into their parents. \n\nThey should invite the sister and husband to things with his wife's family, clearly their parents made their bed.", "Until the inheritance comes up. I doubt they\u2019ll split it equally if not bequeathed. I\u2019ve seen the worst of people surrounding inheritances; tossing family under the bus.", "There are laws in some jurisdictions to prevent it or make it harder, but not enough!", "Great job standing up for yourselves and really happy to hear your sister and her husband are sticking with you. I hope your relationship with them grows. Perhaps your parents will eventually come around, but if not, you have your dignity and your love intact! Good luck to you. Signed, about to celebrate 28 years with my wife.", "Your parents suck. I would tell your sister and her husband about the inheritance and that you are going low contact with your parents. Plan holidays with your sister and her husband and enjoy your family. Not your parents.", "I am glad to hear that your sister was on your side after she heard you out!", "*HUGS* I'm glad things more or less worked out. At least you have your sister on your side and your parents coming around was always a long shot.", "I am so sad that you learned the truth of your fears.\n\nThe inheritance issue are you planning to adopt? have a child by your wife that wouldn't biologically be yours? since you aren't going to update, I'll have to live without knowing LOL.\n\nI'm so glad your sister saw the light and stood up for you.  I do hope going forward that your relationship improves.  \n\nHave a lovely vacation with your In-laws.", "Oof. This hurt. I\u2019m so sorry for what you\u2019re going through. I hope you and your wife come out of this stronger. At the very least, now you know where you rank on your parents list of priorities, and can return the favor.", "> My sister said \"well then we're not going to Italy, then. You two (mom and dad) can go, but we're not. I feel horrible now.\" Cue argument between parents and my sister. My wife and I sat there with our mouths hung open until my sister + her husband got up and left.\n\nwhy does it feel they might change their minds. I say this because i saw a comment of OPs from the og post about how they need more help than OP does.", "Probably sister didn't even notice. They're adults with their own lives and priorities. I don't think OP ever brought it up with her either, so she didn't even know it was happening.", "OP says she doesn't need it anyway, while her sister does. So it wouldn't be the end of the world if it was an uneven split but it'd better at least acknowledge OP properly", "What\u2019s really sad is the parents had no shame admitting it was \u201cabout the inheritance\u201d.  I mean did they think they could exclude the wife and their daughter would never catch on.", "I'm glad your sister and her husband aren't like your parents. You should fill her in on what your parents said after she left. So she knows the kind of people they truly are. \n\n\nTho i hope that wouldn't effect the inheritance to your sister, as you mentioned she and her husband could need it. \n\n\nGood luck with your relationship with sis", "Probably just means the inheritance will skip both you and your sister and go to any bio grandchildren.", ">\"getting into the wrong hands\" so they wanted to dote on my sister + her husband \"to ensure that it won't\" (their actual words). \n\nI'm truly so confused. How does favouring your sister ensure the inheritance goes in the right hands? Inheritance is passed through wills not who love you the most. If they are concerned about having the money continue through generational wealth why not just set up a large fun generically for any bio grandkids? \n\nIf that was their motivation they should be talking to lawyers. Or trying get in your good graces honestly. It doesn't matter how much they have buttered up your sister if you contest the will. It really feels like your parents are full of shit and have primed you to believe this inheritance story", "What country are you in? In the US there are no such laws.  People can cut out their family and leave everything to a goat if they get mad."]}
