It's been amazing seeing so much support! We didn't post an update yesterday since it was Valentine's Day so we're posting it today. We had a family meeting at our house on Monday, and it was interesting.\n\nI started with reminding my dad what he did, how it matched up to all the other times, how it made her and I feel, and how his and my mom's reactions made us feel. I told him that my wife is my everything and what we do, we do together. Our marriage is just as valid. You either want us in your life or you don't and lately your actions have told us the ladder.\n\nThen, I brought up gaslighting. We did some digging the previous night - watched videos and read articles to better understand it. I explained to them what it was, how they did it, and how it made us feel. My conclusion was my reasoning for planning the separate vacation with my wife's family.\n\nMy sister started crying. She apologized for not saying anything and not paying attention. Her husband was upset as well. My sister said \"you have to book a different flight, dad\" to which I pointed out that it was too late - our vacation was already booked and we couldn't bail on it. My sister said \"well then we're not going to Italy, then. You two (mom and dad) can go, but we're not. I feel horrible now.\" Cue argument between parents and my sister. My wife and I sat there with our mouths hung open until my sister + her husband got up and left.\n\n[My suspicions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10z5ieg/comment/j81rvjb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) were right. The reason why my wife and I were being treated unfairly was because of inheritance fears. Their explanation was that they didn't want inheritance \"getting into the wrong hands\" so they wanted to dote on my sister + her husband \"to ensure that it won't\" (their actual words). That right there confirmed everything because they basically said \"yes we treat your sister + her husband better and we're driving it home with the inheritance.\"\n\nIt ended with my parents leaving angry - not at their actions, but the fact that they were getting called out. From this point on, we will be going low contact with my parents and maybe try to amend things between my sister + her husband. We will not attend gatherings/events if one/both of us feel excluded. We will demand that we be treated just as seriously. We now know our boundaries and we will set them. It was a very heartbreaking experience and we were disgusted at the whole thing, we still are. Right now, we just have to take this time to move forward.\n\nI doubt we'll be able to make any more updates beyond this, but again we wanted to thank you all for the advice, love, and support! We truly appreciate it! This was a throwaway but I think I'm going to keep this account up but just not save the login info. Thank you so so much and best wishes!", "created_utc": 1676770073, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115xv1s/update_aita_family_vacation/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Awesome that your sister and her husband seem to be on your side!", "I really wish there were non-alienation laws surrounding inheritance. So many queer children are cut from generational wealth advantage just for being queer. What an awful thing to say and do to one of their children. I wish the best for you and your wife. Spend lots of time with her family. They sound great.", "Your bio egg and sperm donators are quite the pieces of work.  Unbelievable.  Id go no contact with them and save your love and allegiance for your in laws.  Never ever let you wife be humiliated by your bios ever again. Never.\n\nGood luck.", "Sadly that didn't help knock some sense into their parents. \n\nThey should invite the sister and husband to things with his wife's family, clearly their parents made their bed.", "Until the inheritance comes up. I doubt they\u2019ll split it equally if not bequeathed. I\u2019ve seen the worst of people surrounding inheritances; tossing family under the bus.", "There are laws in some jurisdictions to prevent it or make it harder, but not enough!"]}
