I knew her husband for years before she married him because his son and I have been in school together since kindergarten. I don't like his son. Never did. As far as I know he's not like an instigator kind of bully but he is the kind of person who finds it funny when something embarrassing happens to a kid, he's the kind of person who will bring it up again and again, he's also the kind of person who uses slurs. Even now at 16 he's not all that different from when he was 6.\n\nMy mom and her husband over the years have tried to make the four of us a family. They have spent a lot of money and time trying to create these bonding moments and memories to look back on fondly but my favorite part of all those moments was spending time with my mom, not her husband's son. I still wouldn't call him family or my sibling. I wouldn't call him a friend either.\n\nEver since April his friends and him have seen each other way less, because his dad and some of his friends parents are clamping down on the friendships hoping they will end up being better people and less influenced to go with the crowd.\n\nMy mom and her husband have tried to encourage us to spend more time together. I have been asked to include him with my friends. He's been encouraged to apologize to people and try to make other friends. He's done none of that. I have been pretty clear with my mom that my friends and I are not interested in including someone like him.\n\nMy friends and I have Halloween plans and my mom was looking for me to include him, because he has none, and he was trying to meet up with his friends secretly. I told my mom there was no way I would let him ruin mine and my friends plans. She told me it would be a big thing for him to have someone like me to introduce him to a different crowd, a kinder crowd. She talked about us being family, being brothers. I told her that just because she married his dad, didn't mean I started to care about him or like him, I told her it only made us family in the sense that we lived together, but we would never be family like she wanted.\n\nShe told me she was disappointed in me for not giving him a chance. She said if I would just try I could be really surprised. That family is important. Caring about people too. Apparently her husband has had the same conversation with his son many times. She didn't with me for so long because she hoped I would soften with time and open myself up to trying at some point.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1666952443, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yfkcac/aita_for_telling_my_mom_that_her_marrying_her/", "score": 3668, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You did not choose for her to get married, you are not required to play act a role to please your mother.\n\nI would also like to say that your mother is not asking you to act like his brother in this situation. A lot of biological parents do this as well with their kids, where they want their kids to be best friends, and for one of the kids to be a caretaker for the other. Her wanting you to spend all your time with him, and \"share\" your friends with him is not only disrespecting the sentience of your friends as if they shouldn't have the right to be able to say they don't want to hang out with your step brother, but he's trying to place you directly in the role of a caretaker.

Doesn't matter how many conversations your stepdad is going to have with him right now because at 16, it's too late. \n\nYour mom should focus more on your feelings and your happiness.

It doesn't work like that.\n\nI would sit your mom down and tell her that you would *never* insist she be friends with someone she dislikes who has not been a kind person and that she is going too far. Being alone and not having decent friends is the price this kid is paying for his past behavior. It's a lesson for him to learn about how he wants his future to pan out and what ways his behavior and how he treats people will affect that.

I was 11. I knew her husband for years before she married him because his son and I have been in school together since kindergarten. I don't like his son. Never did. As far as I know he's not like an instigator kind of bully but he is the kind of person who finds it funny when something embarrassing happens to a kid, he's the kind of person who will bring it up again and again, he's also the kind of person who uses slurs. Even now at 16 he's not all that different from when he was 6.\n\nMy mom and her husband over the years have tried to make the four of us a family. They have spent a lot of money and time trying to create these bonding moments and memories to look back on fondly but my favorite part of all those moments was spending time with my mom, not her husband's son. I still wouldn't call him family or my sibling. I wouldn't call him a friend either.\n\nEver since April his friends and him have seen each other way less, because his dad and some of his friends parents are clamping down on the friendships hoping they will end up being better people and less influenced to go with the crowd.\n\nMy mom and her husband have tried to encourage us to spend more time together. I have been asked to include him with my friends. He's been encouraged to apologize to people and try to make other friends. He's done none of that. I have been pretty clear with my mom that my friends and I are not interested in including someone like him.\n\nMy friends and I have Halloween plans and my mom was looking for me to include him, because he has none, and he was trying to meet up with his friends secretly. I told my mom there was no way I would let him ruin mine and my friends plans. She told me it would be a big thing for him to have someone like me to introduce him to a different crowd, a kinder crowd. She talked about us being family, being brothers. I told her that just because she married his dad, didn't mean I started to care about him or like him, I told her it only made us family in the sense that we lived together, but we would never be family like she wanted.\n\nShe told me she was disappointed in me for not giving him a chance. She said if I would just try I could be really surprised. That family is important. Caring about people too. Apparently her husband has had the same conversation with his son many times. She didn't with me for so long because she hoped I would soften with time and open myself up to trying at some point.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They get a bad rap (look at any fairy tale), so she may be getting accused of favoring you and yadda yadda yadda and just trying to be a \"good step mom\".\n\nShe kind of isn't allowed to look badly on him for fear of being the wicked step mother. \n\nShe also likely is seeing him through his father's eyes, and I imagine her marriage relies on her being optimistic and positive about his behavior.  \n\nHopefully it'll get better once you're both adults. That his dad is clamping down on his time with friends is a moderately good sign.\n\n(Step dads tend not to get as much flack because life is not fair, misogyny exists, and childrearing is seen as woman's work)", "halloween, 1997. as i don my Scream mask and prepare to head out for the night, my LAME-O seven year old sister, fully princessed up, runs up behind me and says \"mommy said you HAVE to take me trick or treating, because we're family and its not safe for me to by myself\" and sticks out her tongue at me. i give her my most withering glare and yell  in the general direction of the kitchen table, where i know my mom is sitting clipping coupons, \"Honestly I don\u2019t see how people can even think like this.  Two grown adults literally playing _Now Kith_ with actual human people?  Fuckin lunacy!!!! I HATE YOU MOM AASRRRRGGHHHHH\"", "Yikes!  If I got it wrong, sorry OP!!

I suggested his home life and everyone else\u2019s would be more comfortable if he could find a way to get along with him. Especially since, however much OP doesn\u2019t like it, his stepbrother is his stepbrother. There\u2019s nothing he can do (as a minor) about the fact that they *are* family and share a home and parents. All I suggested was that an attempt at cordial and kind behavior might go a long way. \n\nFurther, as for the stepchild \u201cjust existing\u201d point, the existence of a stepchild doesn\u2019t immediately mean a relationship, and certainly not one comparable to a child that a family has known since infancy. It\u2019s unreasonable to demand that a family immediately feel the exact same. That\u2019s all I said. Not that stepchildren should be treated badly in any way. I suggested the opposite to OP in this case and everyone is mad because apparently, since the OP is a teenager like most redditors, asking for the smallest amount of peace extended to someone you don\u2019t like is an entirely unreasonable comment. It\u2019s just really funny tbh.", "Okay, he doesn\u2019t have to be \u201cfamily\u201d, why are you so against spending any time with him at all?", "Ignore this person. You're a household, but that does not mean you have to make these people your family.", "LOL. That\u2019s not what a family unit is. That\u2019s what you want your family unit to be. I have friends I consider family and I have familu I\u2019ve gone no contact with. Acknowledging that someone IS family isn\u2019t accepting or keeping you in a toxic relationship. It\u2019s literally acknowledging that they fit the definition of family. I may not contact my sister and may not let her have contact with my children...but she\u2019s still my sister. She\u2019s still my family. Not wanting someone to be in your family unit doesn\u2019t change the fact that they are in your family unit. I always laughed when people were all: Obama\u2019s not my president. Trump\u2019s not my president. Biden\u2019s not my president. Sorry, if you are a US citizen...they were/are your president. You just didnt/don\u2019t want them to be. But it doesn\u2019t change facts. You may not like your mom...but she\u2019s still your family.
