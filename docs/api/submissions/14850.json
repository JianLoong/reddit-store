The roommates are both guys we knew from sharing friend circles, and one of them posted on their instagram story they were looking for a 3rd roommate for a house they had found on Zillow. The timing worked out, and they were both open to living with a couple, and so we all moved in together back in the fall. \n\nFast forward, one of said roommates calls us and tells us he wants to move in with his girlfriend (essentially break his portion of the lease - all 4 of our names are on the lease). It\u2019s not the end of the world, as my fianc\u00e9 and I were excited by the idea of it now being a 3 person house and absorbing the extra rent. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I were talking with the roommate that isn\u2019t moving out about our options (get another 4th to move in, or have it be just the 3 of us) and he mentions that he also wants to move in with his girlfriend, and the two of them had thought about maybe \u201ctaking over this place\u201d meaning my fianc\u00e9 would be out of a place to live. He then asked what our plans in the long term were. He didn\u2019t ask us if we were ok with this, it was more of a statement. \n\nI let it sit for a minute but then went back to clarify with him, that we really love the house and have no plans on moving out, and it\u2019s not fair of him to displace us by moving his girlfriend in. I said that I love living with him now, and the 3 of us form a great roommate situation that i\u2019m 100% cool with going forward, but that i don\u2019t want his gf to move in if it means starting a clock of when they expect us to move out. (His girlfriend is great and I was 100% open to her moving in and it being 2 couples until he said that.)\n\nHe seemed to understand what he wants puts us in a tough spot, but he also told me that because he found the house on zillow and my fianc\u00e9 and I were added on after he and the prior roommate decided to live together, that he felt like the house was his first. \n\nAITA? My fianc\u00e9 and I are on the lease and we love living there, and we don\u2019t want to leave or be made to feel uncomfortable in our own home.

Period.", "NTA but it's already out there so shit is probably going to get uncomfortable regardless.  Unfortunately I have no solution for you other than you and fiance are legally on the lease so there's not much he can do about it.", "NTA. He wouldn\u2019t have the house without you and all of your names are on the lease.", "NTA you\u2019re on the it does not matter who was first.

You make it clear to your friend that you all have equal rights and obligations and his having found the house is immaterial. This guy has the mentality of a kindergartener.

But he isn't. \n\nIt's also effort and expensive to move out. Your group can decide, that his girlfriend moves in addition but he can not force you to move out just because of his new love.", "NTA, you all agreed and the names are on the lease.

I would tread carefully - better to lose the rental and keep a friend than vice versa, imo.", "Eh, ESH or NAH. Morally, friend was there first, so I can see why he thinks you should move if he wants to stay there with his gf. I can also see how now that there are two of you and one of him it seems like the majority of the lease holders might feel like they should have roommate veto power. Either way it's going to be uncomfortable now, so if you aren't close friends with the roommate you can have a house standoff to see who moves out first since legally none of you own the home and so have no claim to it after your leases are up. Until then, he can want whatever he wants but is bound by the lease.", "YTA if he was there first", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are all on the lease and it doesn\u2019t matter who found it first but you have to figure out a long term living situation. Find a fair way to choose which couple gets the house and the other couple moves out when the lease ends. You aren\u2019t going to live with roommates forever so why not sort it out now, as adults", "Thats such a stupid phrase", "No he wasn\u2019t, he found the place but they all moved in together.

And it's due in the morning. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Why is it that every child does that lol?", "There's no calling dibs when there are contracts. He'll probably start trying to make life difficult for you if he really wants the house though so, while it sounds petty, always retaliate in kind, his life there shouldn't be better than yours. He'll accept or move out eventually.

Nta, but there's going to be rough roads ahead as he tries to force the issue.", "NTA. Contractually, you have every right to be there. How much longer is left on the lease? Maybe stay until lease is up, & you+fiance can start looking for a new place in the meantime.", " NTA unfortunately for your roommate this is a legal issue that he is in the wrong side of. Contact the landlord today and inform him bf and yourself are renewing the lease. He can do whatever he needs to do!", "Nta and legally he cant make you leave, or call fibs.

My kid is a freshman but even when he was in elementary and middle the school system had a portal that listed all the homework and projects due with dates per grade.", "NTA but I would revert to your stance on being open to his girlfriend moving in and it being two couples. You and your girlfriend are both on the lease so he doesn\u2019t have more of a claim than the two of you. It really doesn\u2019t matter who found the Zillow listing. Still, having his GF take that 4th spot is also a completely reasonable plan.", "Nta but obv once your current contact is up you're out of luck.", "NTA  He can move his girlfriend in and basically split the rent between the two couples.  Your names are on the lease and he has no standing to force you out.", "NTA stay there. Make him feel uncomfortable and leave.", "You sound like someone who doesnt plan things well, then gets mad when people dont jump over hoops for you. \n\nTry to remember the 7 Ps!.. Proper Prior Planning Prevents Piss-Poor Performance!", "It\u2019s a good phrase it is just used incorrectly here", "I mean tbh, I do feel like the one time someones lack of planning would constitute an emergency on my part would be for my kids... but I also homeschool so I've never experienced this type of scenario lol.", "Well his logic is poor. He found a house that he ultimately could not afford. So he pulled you and your fianc\u00e9 in. He\u2019s found a girlfriend\u2014great for him\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean you can kick people out of homes you don\u2019t own.\n\nYOU ALL ARE RENTING. And he\u2019s renting above his individual means. Your names added first or last to a least all mean the same thing. YOUR HOME until the landlord boots you all equally \n\nObviously not a lot of going to work out now he\u2019s laid his cards on the table. But IMO if he wants to live with us girlfriend, he should find a place HE can afford WITH HER and leave you all to sort out the house.

You are on the lease, and there is no reason for you to move out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut to avoid all of that problem, refuse to let his gf get on the rent ... now that he told you his plans, do that to protect yourself from his assholery.", "NTA, you are on the lease until it expires.
