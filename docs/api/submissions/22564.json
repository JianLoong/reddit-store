They are now at their destination and have fun.\n\nA few years ago I backed out of any group vacation since I was always expected to be everyones travel agent and travel guide and micro manage everyones affairs, since I am a very experienced (\"low budget\") traveller. I didn't enjoy this so I stopped and now I just travel solo or with one other person max.\n\nMy husband and 3 friends wanted to go on vacation. I told him from the beginning he can ask me questions and I would help but I would not plan for them. I also said \"We want to do this and that, can you research and book it?\" is NOT the kind of question he can ask. He said I don't need to bother them, they will manage on their own in a very rude tone. So I completely backed off and watched from the side line.\n\nAs expected, they did some rookie mistakes that costed them a (not so significant amount of) money but more important: Lot's of stress. My husband sent me a pretty pissed massage and called me a petty AH before take off. I now wonder if I really am the AH.\n\nEDIT:For those interested: Here are the situations I watched and let them struggle with\n\n1. Everyone booked their flight tickets separate for unknown reasons. Not a grave mistake as it is but 2 of them are basically tech/internet noobs who can't log in somewhere for the life of it. This will become important later.\n2. They all booked their (inner EU, low cost airline, direct) flights not directly with the airline but through some travel booking portal which is basically known as scammy - they provide next to no service and as soon as anything goes wrong you're on your own. Also it's hella intransparent what exactly you pay for. They thought they saved a shitton of money but this was because the price did not include any luggage (just a hand bag sized carry on). They later had to add luggage and paid about 60\u20ac more per person per flight in the end compared to booking through the airline from the beginning.\n3. The online check in through the above mentioned scammy travel website is known to be faulty or not working. People are supposed to automatically get their boarding passes via Mail as soon as online check in opens but that often just doesn't happen. Apparently they online noticed that the boarding passes are missing at 2am (departure was 6am) and they had to wake up the whole travel group and then try to figure how to check in manually AND try to help the 2 \"tech savvy\" people (see point 1) do it. It took 2.5 hours apparently.\n4. The airline they took is the cheapest of all low budget carriers but they are not for the weak as well because they have a SHITLOAD of hidden fees and hefty fines for about everything. So one thing is they require online check in and you have to bring your boarding pass either a) printed on paper or b) in their app. Opening the PDF in the mail is not accepted. Check in at the airport OR having them print your ticket because you forgot costs 60\u20ac fee. They also have the stictest rules about carry on (they only allow handbags and the like nothing as big as a backpack) and if your carry on is too big you pay a 60\u20ac fine and need to check it in. They actually managed to fuck up the ticket thing AND the hand luggage thing.\n5. They almost missed the small fact that they need PASSPORTS to travel to their destination since a few years (Europeans now know where this takes place) and not only IDs. None of them had a passport and they almost missed the time frame to get them issued and it was all very stressfull (I was aware and would have said something in time if they hadn't noticed).\n\nEdit 2 because it sometimes came up: Yeah, it is very basic knowledge for everyone who ever planned a vacation. As far as I am aware though, my husband never did. Until he was in his mid 20's he would just go to vacation with his parents (just hop in the car, parents took care of everything) and then he simply did not go on any vacations until we started dating. From there on I was the one planning stuff. I do genuinely not believe that he ever booked a flight or rental car himself before. Ages involved: Late 30's, early 40's. \n\nI know that 2 other friends always book all inclusive through agencies. The 4th guy is acutally the best prepared (HE had his boarding pass in the App and right size carry on) but he's lazy and probably did not feel to plan for the others as well. So that's how 4 adult people can make so many mistakes.

I didn't, for example, know this stuff before I had an awful low-budget airline experience, and thus became better prepared. I think it's fair that you want them to have some of those experiences themselves, but I also tend to air on the side of \"it's kind to prevent hardship for others when it doesn't place undue burden on you.\" Here, I'm not sure I see the undue burden on you to tell them your own experience with those airlines. You're not booking the trip for them, it's just a heads up. \n\nI'm still not entirely clear how the argument with your husband came about, and that detail seems to be the crux of the AH issue.

Adults shouldn't have to have another adult hold their hand for every little thing. Especially planning a trip. I think you may identify with the husband and can't do much for yourself to call her the dick. Yes, I know you called him one too, but only AFTER you called her one. Grow up and plan your own shit.", "I fly with Ryanair several times a year to go to my home country for vacation and never had an issue. But that's because unlike OP's husband and his friends, I know how to book a flight and read the rules like a functioning adult. Yeah they're not the most comfortable planes but I must have flown with them like 20 times and there was never a problem. It's also super easy to book a flight. I'm curious what kind of issues people in the comments had with them.", "I made the mistake of flying Ryanair just once. Never again.

The only other thing he hates THAT much is ironing. So when I make him plan something or iron our laundry he gets all huffy and snappy sometimes. \n\nThis time he actually called after landing and apologized and said he never knew how much work planning a vacation was and if I could help him with the return flights (online check-in, access boarding passes etc.) which I of course do.", "u/ConfideCcture581 is a comment stealing bot, please downvote and report.", "Yeah, thinking the same thing. I don't love them, but I booked it for a 2 hour flight. It's not like any other plane will be more comfortable unless you book business class or something.
