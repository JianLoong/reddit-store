They are now at their destination and have fun.\n\nA few years ago I backed out of any group vacation since I was always expected to be everyones travel agent and travel guide and micro manage everyones affairs, since I am a very experienced (\"low budget\") traveller. I didn't enjoy this so I stopped and now I just travel solo or with one other person max.\n\nMy husband and 3 friends wanted to go on vacation. I told him from the beginning he can ask me questions and I would help but I would not plan for them. I also said \"We want to do this and that, can you research and book it?\" is NOT the kind of question he can ask. He said I don't need to bother them, they will manage on their own in a very rude tone. So I completely backed off and watched from the side line.\n\nAs expected, they did some rookie mistakes that costed them a (not so significant amount of) money but more important: Lot's of stress. My husband sent me a pretty pissed massage and called me a petty AH before take off. I now wonder if I really am the AH.\n\nEDIT:For those interested: Here are the situations I watched and let them struggle with\n\n1. Everyone booked their flight tickets separate for unknown reasons. Not a grave mistake as it is but 2 of them are basically tech/internet noobs who can't log in somewhere for the life of it. This will become important later.\n2. They all booked their (inner EU, low cost airline, direct) flights not directly with the airline but through some travel booking portal which is basically known as scammy - they provide next to no service and as soon as anything goes wrong you're on your own. Also it's hella intransparent what exactly you pay for. They thought they saved a shitton of money but this was because the price did not include any luggage (just a hand bag sized carry on). They later had to add luggage and paid about 60\u20ac more per person per flight in the end compared to booking through the airline from the beginning.\n3. The online check in through the above mentioned scammy travel website is known to be faulty or not working. People are supposed to automatically get their boarding passes via Mail as soon as online check in opens but that often just doesn't happen. Apparently they online noticed that the boarding passes are missing at 2am (departure was 6am) and they had to wake up the whole travel group and then try to figure how to check in manually AND try to help the 2 \"tech savvy\" people (see point 1) do it. It took 2.5 hours apparently.\n4. The airline they took is the cheapest of all low budget carriers but they are not for the weak as well because they have a SHITLOAD of hidden fees and hefty fines for about everything. So one thing is they require online check in and you have to bring your boarding pass either a) printed on paper or b) in their app. Opening the PDF in the mail is not accepted. Check in at the airport OR having them print your ticket because you forgot costs 60\u20ac fee. They also have the stictest rules about carry on (they only allow handbags and the like nothing as big as a backpack) and if your carry on is too big you pay a 60\u20ac fine and need to check it in. They actually managed to fuck up the ticket thing AND the hand luggage thing.\n5. They almost missed the small fact that they need PASSPORTS to travel to their destination since a few years (Europeans now know where this takes place) and not only IDs. None of them had a passport and they almost missed the time frame to get them issued and it was all very stressfull (I was aware and would have said something in time if they hadn't noticed).\n\nEdit 2 because it sometimes came up: Yeah, it is very basic knowledge for everyone who ever planned a vacation. As far as I am aware though, my husband never did. Until he was in his mid 20's he would just go to vacation with his parents (just hop in the car, parents took care of everything) and then he simply did not go on any vacations until we started dating. From there on I was the one planning stuff. I do genuinely not believe that he ever booked a flight or rental car himself before. Ages involved: Late 30's, early 40's. \n\nI know that 2 other friends always book all inclusive through agencies. The 4th guy is acutally the best prepared (HE had his boarding pass in the App and right size carry on) but he's lazy and probably did not feel to plan for the others as well. So that's how 4 adult people can make so many mistakes.

I didn't, for example, know this stuff before I had an awful low-budget airline experience, and thus became better prepared. I think it's fair that you want them to have some of those experiences themselves, but I also tend to air on the side of \"it's kind to prevent hardship for others when it doesn't place undue burden on you.\" Here, I'm not sure I see the undue burden on you to tell them your own experience with those airlines. You're not booking the trip for them, it's just a heads up. \n\nI'm still not entirely clear how the argument with your husband came about, and that detail seems to be the crux of the AH issue.

A lot of european no frills airlines are able to cut costs in terms of landing in smaller airports (e.g., landing at ~~Orly~~ Beauvais Airport 90 min from Paris instead of Charles de Gaulle slightly closer), and that also means that their delay/on-time rate is actually not bad at all. Ryanair and other European budget airlines also tend to run A LOT more flights on the same route and in the same general area, which means it's easier when a flight gets canceled. Ryanair and others in Europe are also subject to more stringent EU rules around things like compensation for stranding/canceling flights, and they make decisions accordingly. Ryanair and others price knowing that they'll be able to charge half the passengers extra for this or that, so if you follow the rules like OP your ticket is essentially being subsidized by people like OP's husband.\n\nSpirit and other no-frills US airlines don't have the advantage of as many second-tier airports like Orly to cut costs, and they're a small enough airline that it's harder for them to cover when there is a delay, compared to a massive airline like United. They also cover a bigger area, the US as a whole is less dense but Sprint has also chosen to fly a lot to the Caribbean and Latin America, so they're spread very thin. They also aren't beholden to the same EU compensation rules so there are more situations where it makes financial sense to strand/ignore problems. Also, because low-budget airlines are less common, while European travelers tend to view things like utter lack of customer service, being told products on board, and gauging fees for forgetting to print a ticket as part-and-parcel of flying with a low-budget carrier, US travelers expect to pay the ticket price and be offered basic courtesy and service, so they are more inclined to view such practices as \"your suitcase is an inch too large\" or \"we're charging $80 to print your boarding pass\" as predatory.\n\nRyanair is also statistically just as safe as pricier European airlines, which can't quite be said for all international budget airlines, but EU regulations are relatively stringent to begin with, so Europeans can rest assured that even on no frills airlines, their plane meets high safety standards, their pilot is rested, etc. The US has most of those same regulations, but I think because Americans are a more customer service-oriented culture, they are more likely to see no-frills customer service as emblematic of further crew/safety rot.\n\nSo in short, Ryanair is just as no frills, maybe even more so, but most people are willing to fly it and would consider it \"better\" than Spirit.", "I mean they are cheaper. A lot cheaper.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople complain but you get what you pay for, and you often pay very little. If you avoid the fees you can literally fly for \u00a310.

A good partner wouldn\u2019t have blamed her for his incompetence. Kinda like\u2026 weaponizing it?", "In my friend group, I'm the happy go lucky friend but even I have a checklist.

It's spelled out every step of the way on the app..", "Nope no fits here.\n\nNice essay tho lol", "It honestly bugs me when people complain about Ryanair, like it makes travel accessible for those of us who couldn't afford it otherwise, and all you have to do is just pay attention to the rules and read the website properly...which you should be doing anyway. \n\nIt's silly to expect to book a \u00a330 flight and then have tonnes of luggage to spare. Paying for priority boarding is the cheapest and easiest way to bring a week's worth of stuff.", "People learned the skill reading but didn't train the comprehension part... if its not a picture its to complex and even then its just decoration.", "OP=NTA\n\nyou were told to butt out\n\nAnd they literally FAFO'd.

You said you would answer questions but not do it for them. If they are I their late 30s/early 40s then they are well into being adults and figuring out how to do things. All these items are things they could have learned by just reading what they were buying.", "YTA. Why are you hoarding your travel planning knowledge? Your husband is not a child who has to learn how to deal with a scraped knee. He\u2019s an adult man whom you are supposed to respect. Just to be clear, you did not tell him the travel booking site was a scam, because he did not ask you if it was a scam? You did not tell him about added fees because he didn\u2019t explicitly ask you about fees? Why would he even ask you anything when you act so put out to begin with?\n\nTravel planning is your forte. People who haven\u2019t planned a vacation don\u2019t know what questions to ask. \n\nYou could have cracked your knuckles, and said, here, sir with me, all of you guys. I\u2019m going to teach you how to plan a smooth vacation so that you\u2019ll be able to do this really well on your own next time. Take notes. \n\nInstead, you just did nothing and watched them set themselves up for misery when they\u2019re supposed to be on holiday. \n\nYou come across as really resentful and petty. Are you sure you even like any of these people, including your husband?\n\nDo you not think perhaps he told you curtly no need to bother because you came across as not wanting to help? You seriously thought this was sufficient payback for your husband saying he could manage?\n\nA married couple is supposed to be partners, each helping the other, and showing they care. I don\u2019t get this impression at all reading this. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about a vacation. It\u2019s about a litmus test on your marriage.

When told to f\\*ck off, I generally f\\*ck off.\n\nSometimes I sit on the sideline with popcorn in hand, snickering.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You have to remember that once you weren't knowledgeable and probably made mistakes too. It's understandable that your husband is angry and frustrated by having to struggle through,  but is taking it out on the wrong person.  None of it was your fault or responsibility. You wrangled deals and organized the vacation process in the past,  but you made it clear that you wouldn't be doing it anymore.  Know what it sounds like?  A THEM problem, not a YOU problem.  Brozo and company need to just suck it up,  take the L, and use this experience to do better in the future.", "NTA, in my previous relationship I was also the one who had to organize everything. It gets very tiring after a while.", "NTA. \n\nI also had a child free wedding, and the only exception I was willing to make was for my only brother (who I barely get to see because of our locations) and his wife who were going to have a 2 month old by the time of our wedding. We were even going to pay for their hotel next to the venue in case one of them wanted to disappear for a bit with the baby, or use the bridal suite). You know what they did? The wife stayed home and my brother came (both out of respect for the child-free aspect, and also because there were some terrible wildfires in our area that made the air quality less than ideal for a newborn). \nFuture MIL sounds like an absolute nightmare, and I would not budge if I were in your shoes.", "NTA and why step in at all? They are grown men who I assume are also employed.  Let them figure out their own crap if they want to do big boy things.", "NTA if they can hold jobs they can manage their group trip.", "Was this Three Stooges Try to Go on Vacation?

You need a nobel peace prize or something", "Lmfaoo NTA and I wish more people would do what you did", "Yep, I lived in a major European city for a couple of years and knew the city well. After I moved back to the US, people would often ask for advice when visiting the city. I'd usually preface it by saying, \"This is stuff I like and find interesting, but best to do your own research as well to maximize your time there.\" People were generally grateful for the help. Then I started helping people with hotels in this city as I had stayed in a number of them over the years and was familiar with the city and its neighborhoods, good and bad. For a while it was fine, but then people started bitching about my suggestions, ie \"The hotel was really nice, but the neighborhood was iffy. We would have preferred a different neighborhood\" or \"Ugh, the rooms were so small and the building so old\" or \"The proprietor was SO unfriendly.\" etc. Well, the advice you get from me is worth exactly what you paid for it ($0!!!). After the fifth or six person came back to whine that my suggested hotel wasn't good enough or wasn't right, I just stopped offering suggestions. I don't need to hear people's complaints when I was just trying to be helpful. Thankfully, by the time that happened, I'd been living back in the US for several years, so my go-to response was \"Oh, it's been so long since I've lived in [city], I just don't feel comfortable making suggestions as things have changed so much since then\" and left it at that.", "I\u2019d imagine that it was somewhat amusing to watch.

Their trip sounds miserable.

That\u2019s an unhealthy dynamic in a marriage.", "Maybe you should ask yourself why this post is so triggering for you.  High school spatting, not a partnership and the wayOP is on here arguing with everyone thinking her behaviour is petty, is very telling in itself.  She\u2019s even trying to control responses.

Her further pieces of rationale make her sound even worse.", "he fucked himself by getting pissy she wouldn\u2019t plan everything for him \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Oh! Me!
