{"id": 22564, "submission_id": "152y4bz", "title": "AITA for watching my husband and his friends fuck up their vacation without helping?", "selftext": "First: I would have not let them completely nuke their vacation and I always had an eye on what they did to intervene. They are now at their destination and have fun.\n\nA few years ago I backed out of any group vacation since I was always expected to be everyones travel agent and travel guide and micro manage everyones affairs, since I am a very experienced (\"low budget\") traveller. I didn't enjoy this so I stopped and now I just travel solo or with one other person max.\n\nMy husband and 3 friends wanted to go on vacation. I told him from the beginning he can ask me questions and I would help but I would not plan for them. I also said \"We want to do this and that, can you research and book it?\" is NOT the kind of question he can ask. He said I don't need to bother them, they will manage on their own in a very rude tone. So I completely backed off and watched from the side line.\n\nAs expected, they did some rookie mistakes that costed them a (not so significant amount of) money but more important: Lot's of stress. My husband sent me a pretty pissed massage and called me a petty AH before take off. I now wonder if I really am the AH.\n\nEDIT:For those interested: Here are the situations I watched and let them struggle with\n\n1. Everyone booked their flight tickets separate for unknown reasons. Not a grave mistake as it is but 2 of them are basically tech/internet noobs who can't log in somewhere for the life of it. This will become important later.\n2. They all booked their (inner EU, low cost airline, direct) flights not directly with the airline but through some travel booking portal which is basically known as scammy - they provide next to no service and as soon as anything goes wrong you're on your own. Also it's hella intransparent what exactly you pay for. They thought they saved a shitton of money but this was because the price did not include any luggage (just a hand bag sized carry on). They later had to add luggage and paid about 60\u20ac more per person per flight in the end compared to booking through the airline from the beginning.\n3. The online check in through the above mentioned scammy travel website is known to be faulty or not working. People are supposed to automatically get their boarding passes via Mail as soon as online check in opens but that often just doesn't happen. Apparently they online noticed that the boarding passes are missing at 2am (departure was 6am) and they had to wake up the whole travel group and then try to figure how to check in manually AND try to help the 2 \"tech savvy\" people (see point 1) do it. It took 2.5 hours apparently.\n4. The airline they took is the cheapest of all low budget carriers but they are not for the weak as well because they have a SHITLOAD of hidden fees and hefty fines for about everything. So one thing is they require online check in and you have to bring your boarding pass either a) printed on paper or b) in their app. Opening the PDF in the mail is not accepted. Check in at the airport OR having them print your ticket because you forgot costs 60\u20ac fee. They also have the stictest rules about carry on (they only allow handbags and the like nothing as big as a backpack) and if your carry on is too big you pay a 60\u20ac fine and need to check it in. They actually managed to fuck up the ticket thing AND the hand luggage thing.\n5. They almost missed the small fact that they need PASSPORTS to travel to their destination since a few years (Europeans now know where this takes place) and not only IDs. None of them had a passport and they almost missed the time frame to get them issued and it was all very stressfull (I was aware and would have said something in time if they hadn't noticed).\n\nEdit 2 because it sometimes came up: Yeah, it is very basic knowledge for everyone who ever planned a vacation. As far as I am aware though, my husband never did. Until he was in his mid 20's he would just go to vacation with his parents (just hop in the car, parents took care of everything) and then he simply did not go on any vacations until we started dating. From there on I was the one planning stuff. I do genuinely not believe that he ever booked a flight or rental car himself before. Ages involved: Late 30's, early 40's. \n\nI know that 2 other friends always book all inclusive through agencies. The 4th guy is acutally the best prepared (HE had his boarding pass in the App and right size carry on) but he's lazy and probably did not feel to plan for the others as well. So that's how 4 adult people can make so many mistakes.

I didn't, for example, know this stuff before I had an awful low-budget airline experience, and thus became better prepared.

You're not booking the trip for them, it's just a heads up. \n\nI'm still not entirely clear how the argument with your husband came about, and that detail seems to be the crux of the AH issue.

He did asked explicitly not to be bothered.  How teenage of him to be snippy at his wife-mom and then call her rude later when he is incompetent.  You guys are married? If you want this marriage to last, he needs to go to some sort of class or counselling to work on growing up.  You need to work on knowing that this is BS and not something you would should even question if you have done something wrong.", "A few years ago they cancelled thousands of flights across Europe due to \"scheduling conflicts\", my flight home happened to be one of the very first affected. RyanAir couldn't get me back for another 5 days after my booked return. I ended up spending a relatively enormous amount to fly home on my intended day with Air Lingus instead. My original return flight cost \u00a340 and the Air Lingus flight cost me a grand as everyone else was in the same position fighting for the few seats available.\n\nI contacted them endlessly and resorted to a third party company to deal with it when they kept fobbing me off with dropped calls and computer generated emails. The company got me the compensation I was due by law (\u00a3400) and a refund of the cancelled flight, but the extra money I spent to get back was my problem apparently."]}
