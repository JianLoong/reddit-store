How did your husband respond?", "NTA Well, this guy clearly isn't a friend to you, and I do wonder if he's much of a friend to your husband at this point. But I'm curious, where is your husband in all of this? I sure hope he's on your side, because if not...I think there's a bigger issue here.", "Holy shit. NTA.", "NTA That was so far over the line I really don't know how he could try to defend it.", "NTA\n\nAt best he's just naive and at worst he was scheming on her behalf.\n\nThe very least he could at least see your side of things and be apologetic, as he could see how this affected you.", "NTA. Wow that\u2019s definitely a friendship dealbreaker in my book. It\u2019s almost like he WANTS to create drama.", "NTA. I strongly agree with the comments that warn you NOT to become the unstable emotional/paranoid wife.  YOUR HUSBAND is the primary victim here, not you, and HE should be the one handling this. He's a full grown adult and should be taking the lead on his own battles. You KNOW this person/situation is a trigger for you, so step back, give yourself time to cool off and calm down before you *and* your husband decide how to deal with this.", " NTA he was never your friend.", "NTA.

That your husband will cheat? Or that by seeing this woman again she will start harassing your husband? \n\nWhy are you more upset about your mental state than your husband's? Because it sounds like this woman harassed him, which is nasty. But FOR YOUR HUSBAND, not for you. Or was he not that distressed by it? In which case it might not be a big deal for him. \n\nBut then, you say he was friends with her for years. Why was he friends with her when she was sending all these messages - why didn't he cut her off immediately? Why did he need to show you all the messages? Don't you trust him? If you felt there was a real risk he'd cheat on you / leave you that is between your husband and you, not this woman.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Even if she legitimately 100% completely changed, he knew how you two felt about her and broke a clear boundary. But also\u2026idk it just feels a little sketchy that of allll places he parked it there and invited your husband to go get it alone without you??

He doesn't have to tell her, and if he did he can make it clear that he wants nothing to do with her. If she was starting again then your husband and yourself can always get a restraining orders. Regarding your friend friendship, clearly it has been really damaged.
