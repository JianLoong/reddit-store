I've known my fianc\u00e9 for 3 years, and he proposed to me this New Year's Eve.I have a 14-year-old daughter and a 12-year-old son. He has a 13-year-old daughter.\n\nOur kids have known each other since the beginning of our relationship, but my daughter just can't stand his daughter. On the other hand, my son likes him and has never had any issues with his daughter.\n\nI can't understand the reason, but everything his daughter does is criticized by my daughter. I've talked to my daughter about it, and all she can say is that the other girl is annoying, childish, and she has even called her names. I really can't grasp the problem.\n\nI find my future stepdaughter sweet and bright. I've never had any issues with her.\n\nMy daughter also doesn't like my fianc\u00e9. She says I could find a much better man. I've talked to my daughter, and she simply says she thinks he's dumb and arrogant.\n\nAfter my fianc\u00e9 proposed and I accepted, I told my kids, and my daughter didn't like it. I expected this reaction.\n\nWhen she met my fianc\u00e9, she was extremely rude. I reacted and sent her to her room, where I told her to stay quiet and that her opinion doesn't matter to me. I'm getting married, and she has to accept it, just like she has to accept sharing a room with her new sister.\n\nShe had a crying fit and hasn't spoken to me for days. I told my sister and my mother, and they say I'm wrong. I can't see how I'm wrong. I'm an adult, a mother, and I decide whom I marry, not a teenager who knows nothing about life.\n\nAITA?  \n\n\n  \nEdit: I told her she had to accept it, and her opinion didn't matter because for the past 3 years, I've been trying to understand her reasons for being against my relationship, and she has never stated those reasons. So now, I'm getting married.  \n\n\n  \nAnd for those who said I didn't make an effort to build a relationship between my stepdaughter and my daughter: My son travels alone many weekends with my fianc\u00e9, while my stepdaughter comes to stay with us at home. Even so, my daughter barely interacts and says it's disgusting for the two of them to travel together for hunting.", "created_utc": 1704504471, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18znq5s/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_she_has_to_accept_my/", "score": 1104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I probably would start without the fiance and his daughter though, so she's comfortable sharing her feelings.

You told her the moment she met your fianc\u00e9 to \"stay quite and that her opinion doesn't matter\" - wow, I wonder why she doesn't tell you anything. Her opinion doesn't matter, so why should she bother?\n\nYou have a right to a life, to be happy, to find love - but the way you're acting is going to guarantee that this never gets resolved and you are destined to have an unhappy daughter, step daughter, and, likely, marriage.

They don\u2019t have the ability to get a job and move out if they don\u2019t like the situation. That means you have a responsibility to them.

She has told you she isn\u2019t comfortable with them and when you didn\u2019t like her reaction to your news you sent her to her room and told her to stay quiet and that her opinion doesn\u2019t matter to you but now you\u2019re mad she isn\u2019t talking to you? \n\nYou say you don\u2019t understand what the problem is, so find out. Do joint therapy if that\u2019s what it takes but ignoring the problem and blaming a 14 year old girl is childish. \n\nYes you are a mom and and adult so start acting like one. \n\nOr go ahead and get married, but don\u2019t be surprised when your daughter moves out once she is old enough and goes LC or NC.", "Actions have consequences.  Making your child uncomfortable in her home and forcing her to live with people she doesn\u2019t like probably won\u2019t play out well for your long term relationship with her.  Can you at least wait until she can have her own room?", "YTA, yeah she's being prickly, but that's a common reaction to this type of situation, and it was incredibly hurtful of you to tell her to \"stay quiet and that her opinion doesn't matter to me,\" also she has to **share a room** with the future stepsister? No **wonder** she doesn't want them to move in!! The room thing is *certainly* a reason why your son is in favor but your daughter isn't. Also yes, while you decide who you marry, but wow, a \"teenager who knows nothing about life,\" yeah, she's young, but she can clearly see that ***she's*** getting the short end of the stick here, and you ignoring her and saying *her feelings don't matter* doesn't fucking help in dispelling that belief.", "Yta. You\u2019re acting like this marriage is only about you, but you have kids now. You clearly don\u2019t give a shit how they feel about it, which makes YTA. Also, your 14 year old is not as stupid as you think she is. It sounds like your mom and sister don\u2019t like him either.", ">where I told her to stay quiet and that her opinion doesn't matter to me. I'm getting married, and she has to accept it, just like she has to accept sharing a room with her new sister\n\nYou almost had me until this line.\n\nYTA and you willfully damaged your relationship with her. Congratulations?\n\nHow impossibly arrogant can a person be to think their marriage has no effect on the children that exist already. You are a parent. Your children are first. You are putting them into a situation they have no control over, and you make it clear you give zero Fs about how it affects them.", "YWBTA if you don\u2019t work with her to see what is driving this response from her. You have to support her and help her realize she isn\u2019t losing you. What\u2019s the story with her dad, could something there be driving this. Oh and for what it\u2019s worth YWABTAH if you force her to share a room with her soon to be stepsister. This will not work for anyone involved. Your daughter will absolutely resent you, your fianc\u00e9, and his daughter for this. It may not seem that big a deal to you but to your daughter you are upending her life and forcing her into a situation and environment she clearly does not want. You should make the transition as easy as you can for her. Taking away her privacy and her space will only add to your issues. Good luck.", "YTA.  Quite frankly, she doesn't have to accept it. If you get married before she's comfortable or before you get to the bottom of the issue, you're going to have 4 years of hell until she can finally leave and go low contact with you.", "YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re undermining her feelings. \n\nHer opinion absolutely does matter. You saying it doesn\u2019t is a great way to ensure that you have zero future relationship with you. \n\nAnd no, she doesn\u2019t have to accept your relationship. \n\nYes, she needs to be polite and civil. But she doesn\u2019t have to like them. And you don\u2019t have the right to tell her that she does.", "Don't worry about her not speaking to you for a few days, as soon as she turns 18, she'll never speak to you again.\n\nYTA alone for telling your daughter you don't care about her feelings and opinion. You say she hasn't given you any reason why she hates your fianc\u00e9 and stepdaughter, but she has, you're just not listening to them because you care more about them and yourself than about your daughter.\n\nYour edit is also proof she has plenty reason to dislike your fianc\u00e9 and his daughter. While your son gets alone time with him, she does not get the same care, not even from you, because the time you do actually invest in spending with her, you force your stepdaughter on her as well. So you don't spend quality time with your daughter alone, and you're making her feel like you don't care about her at all, then verbally confirmed you don't. Ofcourse she hates your fianc\u00e9, he's taking away the only mother she has, and it's not even a good mother. Shame on you.", "YTA you just straight up told your daughter you don't care about her and her feelings. I had my ex mom do that too. I haven't spoken to her in years. Instead of saying her feeling dont matter get some family therapy and some individual therapy for her before you lose your daughter forever. Also do you think maybe she is having a hard time sharing her daughter with another girl and feeling a bit competitive? Has your man actually taken the time to try and bond with your daughter? I once told my mom how uncomfortable that guy she married made me and she ignored it. He was abusive to me. It sounds like you might be missing some crucial interactions between those two. And It makes since that he gets along with your son cause now he gets to be a \"boy dad\" but he already has a daughter. It's not too late to turn this around and work on your relationship with her.", "Unfortunately you are heading for a life where your daughter will start acting out in various ways that don\u2019t benefit her or the family. She will likely move out as soon as she can and your relationship will always be strained into her adulthood. \n\nYou need to get her into therapy ASAP and commence family therapy to overcome this. Until you get to the root of why she feels this way, it will be hell in the house and your marriage may not last if your new husband has to choose his own daughter\u2019s well-being. \n\nThis is what a concerned parent does. They put the wellbeing of their child ahead of their own wants. Punishing her for something that is clearly emotionally affecting her is akin to abandonment in-situ.  Working through it with professional help is short term pain for long term gain.", "YTA for putting them in the same room, your poor stepdaughter.\n\nListen, you get to have a romantic life, that isn't up to your kids. But they absolutely get a say in who their family is. You can force them to share rooms but you cannot control your daughter's mind or behavior.\n\nI feel that in America parents are extremely thoughtless and irresponsible when blending families.\n\nWhy not at least push the marriage and family integration for a year while you get therapy to figure out better ways to blend your family.", "YTA. Go ahead and make arrangements for your daughter to move in with your mom or sister now. You\u2019re never going to have a relationship with her anyway if you continue down this path.", "Oh yeah, YTA.\n\nLook, you want you cake, and be able to eat it too. Life doesn't work like that, and your whole attitude stinks. Yes, you're an adult. Yes, you're a mother. However, you are not being a mom to *your* daughter. You're not even married yet and you're already putting future step daughter on a pedestal, whole dissing your daughter. You also punished her for not agreeing with you. Sure, you can argue that it was because she was rude, not because she didn't agree with you, but you'd be wrong. Your daughter has told you repeatedly that she doesn't like him, or his daughter, and yet here you are...with him, and his daughter.\n\nYou don't respect your daughter, or her opinions, and you wonder why she's in her room crying. Seriously?\n\nIt's time to make a decision, and I really hope you make the right one. Ask you mom and sister what you're missing, since you obviously wouldn't believe your daughter even if she told you point blank, in neon letters, about the actual issue.", "YTA my mom did something similar with moving a man in with me and my two siblings when I was around 12 and she didn't ask us our opinion or thoughts about it. When there was a family meeting a couple years later regarding the constant tension with him I expressed my feelings open and honestly about her prioritizing her relationship over us and she essentially said it's her life and she can do as she chooses. Huge mistake on her part because it forever changed how i viewed her and I don't trust her. I'm 37 now and she isn't with that guy anymore but she makes comments about how she is going to live with one of us she is much older and retired and I've made it very clear that will not be happening. The same way she prioritized herself then I prioritize myself. Maybe if she had done things differently I wouldn't feel this way but she made her bed.  I keep things very arms length with her and it's been that way since that talk. If you want your daughter in your life long term I'd rethink your approach.", "You told her you don\u2019t care about her opinion and that she will have to share a room? YTA.\nHave you considered family therapy? Sounds like you guys (you and your daughter) can use help.", "Yta", "Why are you making her share a room with someone she doesn\u2019t like?!!?? She already is upset about the engagement and you want to upset her more wtf is wrong with you", "YTA. You told your daughter a man matters more than her, that her opinion doesn\u2019t matter, and that she is too childish to have opinions. \n\nForcing her to share a room is a terrible idea. She is going to need to her own space, her sanctuary, more than ever when she is forced to have two more people move into her house. You\u2019re taking the last thing she has away from her. \n\nI can only imagine you saying things to her about comparing your husband\u2019s daughter to your daughter. If you want any family \u201charmony\u201d at all and not to completely destroy your daughter\u2019s trust and faith in you, do not even think this, let alone say it to her. \n\nIf this means delaying your marriage, buying a new house, renovating, dividing a larger room into two, you need to do it.", "Wow YTA. Whilst I understand you love this guy your children should always come before partners (aka someone who is not their actual parent). Your desire for a romantic relationship should NOT trump your daughter\u2019s need for a safe, comfortable, happy life. If she doesn\u2019t trust or like this guy you REALLY need to be figuring out why. There could be a more insidious reason. \n\nIt\u2019s not hard to figure out why she doesn\u2019t like the daughter, she probably subconsciously feels like you\u2019re making a new family and is scared you\u2019ll replace her with his daughter or at the very least will now have to share your attention and affection. This feeling would be made WORSE by a) your son fitting in well and b) your responses to her protestations. \n\nYou are isolating your daughter from yourself and making it clear that you love and care for your new partner more than her. This could do irreparable damage to your relationship and she will likely never forget how you handle this situation.", "YTA for completely disregarding your child\u2019s feelings, and straight up telling her that her opinion doesn\u2019t matter is brutal. \n\nShe\u2019s a child and her whole world is being flipped upside down. You\u2019re not only forcing a man into her life and home, but also a girl very close to her own age who she does not get along with. She may feel she\u2019s being pushed out and replaced and you tossing her feelings aside just cemented that she is your lowest priority. \n\nAs a parent, your child\u2019s comfort and feelings actually have to come first. You\u2019re being incredibly selfish about all this. Yes, you deserve to be happy but not at the expense of your children. Once they\u2019re 18 you can do whatever the hell you want but this is what you signed up for when you had them. \n\nThere are also just better ways to compromise than what you\u2019re doing. For one thing, she deserves her own room. These changes are hard enough, don\u2019t take away her only safe space. If you don\u2019t have enough space, then you need to move or wait until you can. This isn\u2019t like typical siblings who grew up sharing, they are strangers and you are changing the status quo for your personal wants.", "YTA for telling your daughter she \u201chas to accept it,\u201d that you don\u2019t care about her opinion, and that she has to share a room with a new stepsister hates.\n\nHave you observed them interact when they don\u2019t know you\u2019re watching? Is there bullying going on? Does your daughter feel displaced, or outnumbered? Is she missing her dad? Do she and the other girl attend school together? Is there friction there?\n\n\u201cI can't see how I'm wrong. I'm an adult, a mother, and I decide whom I marry, not a teenager who knows nothing about life.\u201d You\u2019re not wrong for marrying. Are are 100% wrong for being so dismissive and condescending about your daughter\u2019s feelings. Forcing the two girls into one room is a recipe for disaster. Their friction will only get worse and I give it six months before your daughter is asking to go live with dad or aunt or grandparents. She wants a sign from you that she still matters, that she\u2019s still a priority, as her entire world is being turned upside down. She didn\u2019t ask for her dad to be gone or for you remarrying, she had no choice in that. And you gave no compassion for her feelings. In a way it doesn\u2019t matter whether her feelings about your fianc\u00e9 and his daughter are fair or unfair, she wants you to give a damn about her.", "YTA the marriage effects her whole life. She doesn\u2019t have to accept it especially if she doesn\u2019t like your new partner and his daughter.

With someone she hates?\n\nDude even outside of that being an asshole move, it's just going to end *terribly.* Obviously you shouldn't drop the marriage or anything over your daughter's feelings, but from that casual little bit of info, it seems like maybe you're not respecting her feelings very much at all.", "As a mother,  your job is to prioritize your kids. You're forced her into a family dynamic she has clearly communicated she doesn't want. You told her straight up that you don't care how she feels or what she needs and wants in her life.

You\u2019re also a MAJOR AH for making them share a room. That\u2019s only going to lead to more problems, fights, and alienating your daughter even further. Her whole life is already being turned upside down with major changes. Forcing her to share her room where I\u2019m sure she finds comfort and relaxation in and taking that one thing of privacy and boundaries that she has away is an even bigger dick move. Maybe she\u2019s scared of change. Maybe they had an interaction that you aren\u2019t aware of. Maybe it\u2019s the fact that the first time she met him you sent her to her room and basically shut her down telling her that you don\u2019t care of her opinion of the man you\u2019re introducing as a major new component into her life that she gets no say in. If she was rude then by all means you did the right thing to send her to her room but you should\u2019ve followed up with her once he had left to figure out why she had such a hostile reaction.

You should\u2019ve done a slow and gradual introduction where you constantly checked in on her and her feelings towards the situation.

Your daughter is telling you in the ways that she is able to with the articulation and emotional maturity and safety available to her. \n\nOften children are telling you things by circling around it. The way she has asked you \"how can you let your son go off with him by himself\" is alarming to me. That sounds like she is trying to say something she can't bear to say directly.

I think u said your daughter doesnt want to participate. But Why would he not take his own daughter, too, to promote bonding?).  \n\nShe doesnt give u rational reasons, which could be a regular teeange thing (well, even us grownups sometimes dislike someone for no real reason). \n\nU say your son never had similar issues. Did u have an in depth talk with your son about all this, similar to how u did with the daughter? Or are just jumping to conclusions he likes stepdad because he isnt complaining? Is he more of a quiet, reserved, shy boy? \n\nHonestly, what crossed my mind is that the daughter actually might have a very good reason for disliking stepdad and that it has to do with his relationship with your son and their trips, and she is trying to protect her younger and less-able-to-advocate-for-himself brother. Your daughter is disgusted with these weekend trips? That is a very specific sentiment OP!\n\nGoing on hunting trips alone with a then 9 (now 12) YO boy as a grown up man who has been dating his mother for only a couple of years and has other kids regularly on the weekends (when he should be spending time with his daughter he probably has shared custody of, or with hid fiancee, or trying to form a bond with his stepdaughter) is very suspicious to me!\n\nI know i could be waaay off and im probably making stuff up.

On the other hand, my son likes him and has never had any issues with his daughter.  \n\n\n  \nI can't understand the reason, but everything his daughter does is criticized by my daughter. I've talked to my daughter about it, and all she can say is that the other girl is annoying, childish, and she has even called her names. I really can't grasp the problem.  \n\n\n  \nI find my future stepdaughter sweet and bright. I've never had any issues with her.  \n\n\n  \nMy daughter also doesn't like my fianc\u00e9. She says I could find a much better man. I've talked to my daughter, and she simply says she thinks he's dumb and arrogant.  \n\n\n  \nAfter my fianc\u00e9 proposed and I accepted, I told my kids, and my daughter didn't like it. I expected this reaction.  \n\n\n  \nWhen she met my fianc\u00e9, she was extremely rude. I reacted and sent her to her room, where I told her to stay quiet and that her opinion doesn't matter to me. I'm getting married, and she has to accept it, just like she has to accept sharing a room with her new sister.  \n\n\n  \nShe had a crying fit and hasn't spoken to me for days. I told my sister and my mother, and they say I'm wrong. I can't see how I'm wrong.

If they can find happiness without compromising that, then by all means they should have their cake and eat it.", "Thank you for saying so \ud83e\ude77", "100 percent, she will.  Assuming that the stepdaughter is genuinely nice, I still feel bad if OP\u2019s daughter acts out against her.  I understand why she would, but that doesn\u2019t mean the other girl deserves it.", "Sounds like. OP came here expecting one response and got the reality of other, and her own \"happiness\" is way more important than her kids.", "Mom needs to put herself in her daughter\u2019s shoes\u2026 YOU as a 14 year old girl, would YOU be okay with sharing your only private space with someone you\u2019re forced to like? You don\u2019t know what goes on behind your back; and regardless, your child should always come before some man!", "Because her feelings don\u2019t count to mom. See how easy that was?", "I hope the daughter whoops the new kid.", "Exactly. I was a single dad with two boys and dated for a long time before I found my new partner. If at any point my boys had a serious issue with anyone I was dating, that person would never have been allowed to live in our house. I would have just waited until the boys were older. If that person doesn't get that, they can keep walking.", "Oh but it won't, they'll just find a reason to ship off her daughter", "no op will make her daughter give up the room to the step daughter", "Well, OP obviously doesn\u2019t see her daughter as a fully fledged human with emotions and needs, so why *would* she care \ud83d\ude43", "This is the part that makes her a shitty mom.  Stop being an ass and get a bigger house", "If the girls fight what will you do? Send them to their room to keep fighting?", "Even if they liked each other, still sucks. My friend was my roommate and it was so annoying at times. If we had to share a bedroom we probably would've killed each other lol", "As a mom to a young 20s son and a teenage daughter, this makes my heart break for you. I can't imagine ever telling either of my kids what your mom told you, no matter how old they are! Please accept this mom-hug from an Internet stranger... \ud83e\udd17", "Reddit makes me feel better my mom died when I was very very young kid and at least with redditors I see it could have been so much worse. I know at least my mom fought cancer hard to be with her kids. Hugs", "I\u2019m so sorry. Wish I could hug you, bake you a cake, and take you to the beach or something \ud83d\ude2d", "Wow your mom sounds harsh. My condolences. My dad has to ask me exactly what day and year I was born. Never had a birthday after age 6. Birthdays roll by and he never gives a flying f---. I'm over it at this point too.", "I legitimately do not understand this, as a parent. My 14 year old is one of my best friends (we're very close) and I can't wait until she's an adult and I get to reap the rewards of the awesome human she has grown into, where we can TRULY be friends. Some people shouldn't be parents and I'm sorry your mom is one of them. Have an internet hug from this stranger too. \u2764\ufe0f", "Damn, I'm so sorry this happened to you. My mother (who died when we were no-contact, zero regrets) told me when I turned 20 that I was now too old to celebrate or even acknowledge my birthdays. I'm 39 now, I'm expecting my 40th birthday to be fabulous!", "But this clearly isn\u2019t the whole story of their relationship. Daughter didn\u2019t just materialize out of thin air and suddenly start acting shitty. What else happened that is making her so upset? My guess is that this isn\u2019t the first completely asshole thing mom has done.", "It matters if she ends up needing and/or wanting to live elsewhere. Teenagers usually have the option to pick which parent they live with at least in the states. The details obviously the matter. He might not be involved at all.", "OP strikes me as the type who blithely ignores anything that doesn't suit her world view. Poor kids!", "but thats not the topic at hand stick to the topic!!!!! /s", "I dont know about that OP is so vague about where her kids father is and doesnt even say if the sd has a mom so its kinda up in the air", "Bad parents often start off as very unhappy parents. You have to take care of yourself to be able to take care of your children. I'm not disagreeing that this mom is making a mistake, but I do disagree with the idea that parents have to give up all of their happiness for their children. Parents need to make sure their own needs are met, and in turn they can fully support AND enjoy supporting their children. When your own needs aren't met, you simply aren't able to be an effective parent.", "The mom is clearly YTA in this scenario and this method of blending their families is a disaster.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference though, between acknowledging the special responsibility parents have to their children when dating and blending families vs. saying parents should always forego their happiness for their kids.\n\nI don\u2019t have kids so I don\u2019t have a dog in that fight. I am however, the stepkid in a happily blended family on on one side. On the other side I have a parent who subtly but persistently made me feel personally responsible for her happiness, and personally responsible for her sacrificing any chance at happiness outside her kids.\n\nI\u2019ll give you two guesses which one caused me more damage.", "OPs own mother and sister tell her she is wrong \n\nOP just wants to get laid so bad she's willing to do this its really pathetic", "This.", "This. \n\nI don't talk to my mom because she continually put (an array of) men before me and my sister.", "But she's an adult. That means she can do what she wants.", "I wish more people took being a parent seriously like this. I understand things don't always work out and divorce happens. But that doesn't mean you stop being a parent. You don't put your new beau over your own kids. OP thinks marriage/divorce is no different from dating/breaking up. There is absolutely a difference.", "This is 100% the correct approach.\n\nYeah, OP has needs, but those needs are not more important than the needs of her children.  OP's example is a gross example of selfish \"parenting\" and it will leave a trail of ruined relationships.\n\nMy friend's parents got divorced as we were graduating high school.  His dad kept the house, remarried a lady 20 years younger within a few months, kicked my 18 year old friend out of the house, and moved the new step daughter into my friend's bedroom.  It's not hard to imagine how healthy those relationships are now, 20 years later.", "Yep. When I was dating my (now) husband, it was important to both of us that everyone was able to mesh/get along. We didn't demand our kids \"get over\" any feelings. We didn't expect them to be BFFs, just everyone be respectful. If they couldn't get along, well, then we wouldn't have gotten married with minors in the house. (Kids did not know this, we didn't want them to feel pressured to lie to us). They did get along, so well, in fact a few years after we were married they got the grand idea to bypass the \"no computers/consoles in bedrooms\" rule by joining forces. Shared a bedroom and turned the other into their gaming room. Win/Win I say, got my TV back.", "Oh shit, that would be fucking cold!", "what a stupid comment.", "Mom \"Stop fighting! Now go to your room!\" \n\nAnnouncer in the back \"it's time for round 2! Let's get ready to rumble!!!\" \n\nMom. Why did I just hear a bell ringing?", "What will likely happen is OP's daughter will get sent to her room and stepdaughter will be allowed free range of the home. It's clear OP thinks her daughter's responses are unreasonable and will end up being the scapegoat for all disagreements.", "That reminds me of the time I asked my mom to give a mom-hug to a stranger because his parents absolutely didn't give a crap about him or his dreams. He was a struggling musician and his folks just didn't consider him as a person - when he went home one year, he found out that they'd thrown out everything in his room, including a comic book collection and all of his records.\n\nAnyway, he'd finally gotten his big break and got into a band that was going on tour opening for a huge act, and was absolutely ecstatic, but his own parents were like, \"Oh. Should we care?\" When he told me this, I was *incensed* on his behalf, and called my mom to tell her about him, his dream, and how his parents just shit all over him. I asked her to be a proud mom for him, and she immediately demanded I hand the phone to him.\n\nThey talked for about fifteen minutes, and he blushed through the whole thing, but when he finally hung up, he said he didn't know how much he needed to hear something like that.\n\nMy mom *ruled*. She absolutely would be giving you a mom-hug, too. Everybody deserves mom-hugs. *Everybody*.", "I would seriously think about running away if I were the daughter. The mother wouldn't care much. She has a shiny new replacement daughter with new daughter smell.", "It's been 3 years they're together with the fianc\u00e9, it would have been 3 years the daughter would have done something. Take a hint, if OP doesn't talk about a father it means there is no one in this place.", "And she might want her parents together so the fianc\u00e9 never had a legit chance", "The Iranian Yoghurt is not the issue here!", "Ah yes sorry forgot this was reddit, must take everything at face value and ask no questions got it! /s", "I agree, so if a parent needs to get their sh!t together, diving head first into a cohabitation or a marriage is probably not the best way to do it.\n\nThey can take all the time they need for self-growth, and their kids don\u2019t have to share a roof with strangers.", "I think we pretty much agree that sucky parents suck\u2026", "I don\u2019t disagree with the mom and OP\u2019s sister.  I\u2019m saying that if OP goes through with this as it is, she\u2019s going to to be shocked at how bad it\u2019s going to get if she thinks her daughter is going to accept it.  I also hope the 13 year doesn\u2019t bear the brunt of it.", "Yes it does. And Damn the torpedoes, full steam ahead", "Does not act like it ...Where was the Family Therapy BEFORE marrying this guy ?", "Kids from divorced households have enough shit to deal with. The least we can do is make their lives as stable and calm as possible.", "Mmmmmm, given the fact that the relationship lasted three years before they got married and it's only one child who has an issue with it, I don't think it's applicable. In my opinion, parents have every right in the world to be happy barring the fact their choice of partner isn't abusive. I think children are given a bit too much power when it comes to their parents dating life.\n\nDo their opinions matter? Absolutely, but there are many cases where the child will never be satisfied with who the parent dates.", "Yep but on character", "Not as stupid as putting 2 teens who dislike each other in the same room.", "That\u2019s not extremely dramatic or anything \ud83d\udc80", "That doesn't solve anything. You take you with you and the inner problems you haven't resolved.", "That\u2019s not a great plan.  She also has at least one grandparent in the picture.", "Or OP sees him as irrelevant.", "Possible. Moms attitude told her not to bother telling her things, so mom doesn\u2019t get to know for now.", "im glad you have seen the error of your ways! Please now call this child a spoiled brat and she fafo and that will be your penance /s", "Fuck that! Asking where the father is is a damned good question \u2049\ufe0f He might have a say in all this.", "100% agree. Your original statement just came across very harsh. Everyone has a right to happiness, regardless of whether they have children.", "Oh totes! kid is a total brat that needs to wind her neck in /s", "lol dont know what wind her neck means but you learn new things everyday \ud83d\ude02"]}
