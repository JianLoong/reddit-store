Seems like common courtesy to not pull the duvet off your sleeping partner while getting out of bed.", "NTA. You said he strips it off the bed and drops it on the floor. That's disrespectful to you and a nasty way to treat the duvet.", "NTA. let me tell you a secret that has completely saved my marriage- use different blankets. That way yall can move and twist and get out of bed without disturbing your partner or having to think clearly 30 seconds after waking up. It's really prevents a world of dumb arguments I swear", "NTA - The two blanket thing is lifesaver if one/both of you pulls all of the blanket for yourself while SLEEPING. But that is not what he is doing. He is waking up and pulling the blanket completely off you (and the bed). He can 100% choose to stop doing this. But he has continued to do it. Why?", "NTA. My partner and I really struggled with a similar situation, and it wasn\u2019t until I sat him down and told him it hurt my feelings that he\u2019s so inconsiderate of me in the morning that it started to get better. He likely doesn\u2019t see it that way, and needs that to be communicated. \n\nI asked my fianc\u00e9 \u201cwhy are you so okay with ruining my morning without a second thought? I would never do that to you.\u201d and it started to sink in. Haven\u2019t had many problems since!", "NTA- you've already asked nicely and it hasn't stuck. What if ya'll just had separate blankets beneath the duvet?", "NTA -if you don't say something; he'll keep forgetting", "Does he stay wrapped in the blanket when leaving the bed or does the blanket end up on the floor?", "He needs to do better.\n\nNTA", "Is he doing this on purpose? To wake you up? or is he just throwing the blankets off as a habit?", "Seriously rude! Dude needs to learn some manners.  NTA", "If he's completely pulling the duvet off you when he gets up, he's doing it on purpose.  He's probably jealous that you get to sleep in longer and this is a passive-aggressive act expressing his envy.  I love my sleep and would yell as well if someone jerked the covers off me, so in my eyes, NTA.  That being said, it seems like you might want to sit your boyfriend down and talk about his feelings and how he expresses them.  You might also want to buy a second duvet and each have your own.", "NTA\n\nI have a solution, though\u2026 two duvets. My husband and I have employed this for years. It will most definitely help both of you. If he pulls your duvet off when he gets up, you\u2019ll know he just likes being a dick in the morning.", "NTA I have issues with my hubby a lot when it comes to bedding. Sometimes we will use two separate quilts and just fold them so we have our own bedding.", "My husband and I have been together almost 10 years and we do not share blankets.", "NTA\n\nYour bf is totally wrong and i hope he will grow up fast.", "NAH.  You share a duvet? I've been married longer than you've been alive and want to say get your own blanket. Seriously.   When I drive somewhere to a hotel I bring my own blanket.  if I fly I ask front desk nicely for a spare.\n\nThat said - if he was doing it on purpose he'd be TA ... yeah, but since it's a rote autonomic behavior it feels as though NAH.

How does an adult not know how to get out of bed without pulling all the covers off of it? It really feels like he's doing it deliberately.\n\nI think in Sweden they just have separate duvets for each person. If the other suggestions don't work, might try throwing money at the problem and do it the Swedish way.", "Info: are you sure he\u2019s not doing this passive aggressively because he\u2019s jealous you get to sleep in and he has to get up?", "ESH. Get two duvets and never look back.", "NTA. Maybe it\u2019s is AH way to tell you to wake up and look for a job?", "INFO: When you say you're off work do you mean like, you're on vacation/using PTO or you're between jobs currently. One of them, he's TA. The other its way more up in the air.", "My husband and I have two separate single duvets on our doublebed for exactly this reason.\nBut unless you work nights, you should be getting up earlier than 11-12pm. That\u2019s just lazy and unattractive and unhealthy. Try harder.\nESH", "INFO:  When you say \"off work,\" do you mean on vacation or unemployed?  If unemployed, for how long?  If unemployed, who's paying the bills?", "I KNOW!  And who the hell gets out of bed EVER and takes the covers WITH them unless it's the middle of the night and your house is ON FIRE??? There are days I jump out of bed quickly, but I have never UNKNOWINGLY pulled the covers completely off the bed. This does NOT seem like an accident...", "In another comment she states that he takes the duvet completely off the bed and puts it on the floor, so this isn\u2019t an accident that two blankets would solve. He\u2019s intentionally trying to wake her up/make her uncomfortable because he\u2019s an asshole. \n\nFor non-asshole partners the two blankets is a great idea though.", "THIS!!!! My wife and I have never shared a blanket in bed we have separate throws that we use because we would constantly steal the blanket from each other. It seriously works best", "Ends up on the floor", "Good idea, I have a weighted blanket for myself but it falls off in the night so maybe two double duvets would be better! We have a king size bed so that should fit.", "Honestly. \n\nMy mom is Swedish and her and my dad have always had two duvets and it just makes the most sense.", "Separate quilts should be number one on the \"relationship advice from couples who have made it past their 50th anniversary\" listicle.", "Its wild how often these \"My partner does X with the blankets\" can be solved with \"Buy more/different/extra blankets\".", "Can second this, you will sleep so much better with your own blankets.", "Absolutely this. My husband and I switched to having separate blankets and I\u2019ve never slept better. Agree with NAH. Easy fix to the problem.", "I traveled last month and asked the hotel for an extra blanket when we arrived.

Just doesn't like her sleeping when he isn't? Yeah sounds like a dick \n\nI still think seperate blankets might help a tad though cause he'll have less plausible deniability to claim it was an honest mistake if it keeps happening!", "Yeah.  He's doing it on purpose.", "Have you asked him why he\u2019s intentionally trying to wake you up/make you uncomfortable? Because this isn\u2019t an accident.", "I hate sharing blankets with bed partners!", "Number two. Number one should definitely be \"separate toothpastes\".", "It might!
