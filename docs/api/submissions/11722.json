Yell at him every time he does it and then say, \"oh, I forgot.\"  He thinks he is being cute when all he is doing is being petty because you get to sleep in.

I\u2019m not one to share bc I end up pulling it off of him and I always cold and he runs hot . It has helped a lot during our course of our relationship. Friends tease us about it but heck we both need our sleep so separate covers and we everything now lol", "NTA. If he needs a covering, he can keep a big, fluffy robe right next to his spot.", "NTA sounds like he\u2019s doing it on purpose. Maybe use separate duvets.", "NTA. There\u2019s literally no excuse for ripping the blankets off your partner every time you get out of bed and throwing it on the floor.

If the blanket ends up on the floor, then you\u2019re doing too much.", "NAH\n\nIt's just habit.  It'd be different if he was doing it on purpose.  Also, have your own blankets.

Okay, maybe the first time. But why every time after that? If it happens again, there\u2019s something weird and petty going on. Hopefully the two blanket thing will help.", "Didn't he promise something similar last two times when you asked him to stop taking the duvet?", "This is ridiculous lmao.  My blanket ends up on the floor all the time when i'm getting out of bed.  Am I intentionally trying to wake myself up or are there possible other explanations besides him maliciously messing with his girlfriend's sleep?", "Mmmm, this is the dream", "Tbf when I made this comment I hadn't yet seen (or they hadn't been made) the comments making it clear that he is completely removing it from the bed and that he was doing it intentionally. I was just assuming he was absent-minded in the morning and would tug it off of her without realizing when he got out of bed- it's entirely possible to have a bad habit without it being indicative of a lack of respect. Clearly that isn't what is happening here by the additional info though", "Also, unless OP is immediately waking up the moment the blanket is gone, he has the opportunity to toss it back on the bed for her. It's fine for him to accidentally pull it off. But have the courtesy and basic decency to put it back over her. That's the bit that feels intentional and malicious.", "Psh forget two double duvets.

Queen sized bed with two overlapping top sheets and two duvets.

If they're not employed and are still sleeping til noon instead of job searching it's a lot more understandable.", "I didnt think it was intentional at first either but her comments later on down the post definitely make it sound like it is....and regardless at the point i made that comment i was literally just asking someone who had already read them what the pupose was behind him doing it on purpose like they alledged he did. Either its intentional or he's just somehow so out of it that multiple times a week he accidently lets the blanket fall on the floor and then doesn't put back knowing that she is using it and will wake up because she is cold, which is a whole other problem. Either he is intentionally waking her up for whatever reason or he is careless and inconsiderate both are problems. And imo both could be helped if not completely solved by seperate blankets lmao\n\n\nEdited after realizing I misunderstood what comment you were replying to", "I don't understand how your blanket could possible be ending up on the floor when you get out of bed. Are you flinging it off you with such force that your full duvet is flying several feet away onto the floor? If so, why?\n\nEither way, doing that when you sleep alone is weird, but fine. Doing it when you sleep with a partner and you're pulling the blanket completely off them has to be intentional. There's no way you see your partner sleeping next to you and get up in the most aggressive way possible that wakes them up without doing it on purpose.", "I'd guess he's feeling resentful that she's sleeping in until noon while he has to get up for work.", "so sleeping in is only allowed if you work? and job searching is only valid before noon? noted.", "If he still does it if they get another, then he clearly doesn't respect her or care about her, and she should take a good look at what makes her stay in that relationship.", "Am I careless and considerate when someone wakes me up and I'm mean to them for 5 seconds before my rational mind comes to the front?  Sometimes I wakeup and I'm so sleep delirious I see things (only when I would sleep for <3 hours during school).  For example I vividly remember two instance during school where I believed I was still in a video game.  Once I was so tired I was imagining SC2 units on my dining table during breakfast, the other time I was half asleep in the car and my sister told me I needed to go to school and I said \"But I need to put iron in the furnace.\"\n\nIs it a character flaw for you to be out of it shortly after waking up?\n\nTo some degree it's laziness because 10 minutes later you could probably set an alarm for yourself to reblanket your GF but it sounds to me she yelled at him before he even woke up.", "In my family sleeping in is only a thing on vacation. I get that the way I was raised wasn't common, but the work ethic I have seen in the working world just reinforces that. \n\nAnd, at least when I was learning how to be a part of the employed world applications were still paper and turned in to a person. If you weren't applying for 3rd shift, and your application wasn't in before noon, you weren't getting a call. The world doesn't work that way anymore, but that's my world outlook. If you disagree that's fine, but I'm the one who asked for more info before I made a decision on who was the asshole. Because, in my book if OP is unemployed and getting upset that the person paying for them to exist pulls the blanket off in the morning, in my book they're still the asshole.", "Yes. It is careless and inconsiderate to make no effort to be conscious of your behavior when it effects other people. If he's doing it accidently I don't expect him to suddenly be able to stop but he could make a point to check and see if he's done it before continuing with his morning seeing as how his girlfriend has been bringing it up as an issue repeatedly.\n\nTo use your own analogy, I don't expect you to suddenly not be out of it for a while when you wake up but I do expect, if you say something nonsensical to your sister and then realize, that you explain what happened and not just idk walk away and let her think you're having a stroke. \n\nAnd it doesn't sound like that at all to me. It sounds like shes been calmly and in a time when he's fully awake explaining the issue and asking him to stop and then after at least a week of so she responded in anger.\n\nEdited to say - ultimately i think it's a stupid unimportant fight that would be solved by using two different blankets that was literally my entire point of my original comment. I'd be way more concerned if he was doing it on purpose lmao which I'm fairly doubtful of", "You\u2019re assuming she\u2019d be able to get back to sleep.
