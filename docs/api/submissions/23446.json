{"id": 23446, "submission_id": "15d2ma9", "title": "UPDATE: WIBTA If I Exposed a 70 yr Family Secret?", "selftext": "It's been about 2 years since [my OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/nqmzvc/wibta_if_i_exposed_a_70yr_family_secret/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2)\nI got a couple messages asking for an update, so here goes. \n\nInitially, everything was put on hold when C19 tore its way through our homes.\nWhen new routines started falling into place, I made an attempt to ask Grandma some direct questions, w/ sensitivity to possible mistreatment in mind as suggested previously. \nShe was adamant there was no malignancy in her home life & after \"forgetting\" probable bio-grandfather for a while, she returned to her previous claim: they'd dated casually to pass the time, that's all.\nI asked again about (previously assumed) Grandpa's deployment to Germany; she wouldn't give dates, but reiterated her insistence he was stateside & they were married by Dad's conception. I'm STILL waiting on a response for that DoD/VA record request. \nA few weeks passed & I'd talked more w/ likely half-aunt. I set aside a time & date w/ grandma to speak candidly & privately (still over the phone, as I work w/ the public & couldn't risk her health by traveling there). She knew what it was about- the \"appointment\" was actually her idea!\nThen... SHE FREAKIN DIED THAT EXACT MORNING.\nGrandma was temporarily in a nursing home while she recovered from a UTI & my aunt was arranging a HHA. The joke now is she just said \"you thought you had me LOL\" and made her exit. \nHer funeral came & went w/ lots of (unrelated) drama. \nHalf brother (from dad) & I decided to shelve the matter indefinitely while affairs were sorted & grieving processed. \nThat lasted about a year before a notoriously chaotic cousin of ours, went & did ALL of the DNA tests on the market- while he is an AH in his own right, he's also *incredibly* intelligent & has undoubtedly put this together by now.\nMy brother & I didn't trust he'd keep the info to himself (especially post funeral drama) & decided it'd be best to get ahead of it.\nI sat Dad down, told him what I knew, what I believed & info obtained from Grandma before her passing, providing him w/ whatever I had by way of documentation. \nHe paced a bit, fiddled w/ knick-knacks, made a couple \"psht... wha?\" faces & kinda shrugged it off. He said wasn't sure he believed it or even cared. I made it clear he wasn't required to follow up in ANY way, but if he had questions I'd help him navigate the data. If he decided to test to remove any doubt, I'd get him one & help him sort that, and his (probable) half sister is open to speaking, sharing info & maybe testing privately. \nThat's it.\nHe hasn't brought it up in the 6 months or so since. Mom says he hasn't w/ her either, but no way to truly know.\n\n\nTL;DR: it didn't happen til I felt my hand was forced, & the conclusion thus far was... anticlimactic? \nThanks again for everyone's input on my OP.", "created_utc": 1690664022, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15d2ma9/update_wibta_if_i_exposed_a_70_yr_family_secret/", "score": 33, "replies": ["He truly may not care. In every way that mattered, the man who raised him was his father.", "There is a point in a man's life where the technicality doesn't matter anymore.  Who we love and hold dear does.  He is happy with his family, just as I would be.  Blood doesn't make family, our connections and who we love does.  For most people that's usually who shares their blood, but sometimes it isn't.  So, the update is, he loves his family regardless of any tests and that's the best you can expect from a good man."]}
