{"id": 23446, "submission_id": "15d2ma9", "title": "UPDATE: WIBTA If I Exposed a 70 yr Family Secret?", "selftext": "It's been about 2 years since [my OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/nqmzvc/wibta_if_i_exposed_a_70yr_family_secret/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2)\nI got a couple messages asking for an update, so here goes. \n\nInitially, everything was put on hold when C19 tore its way through our homes.\nWhen new routines started falling into place, I made an attempt to ask Grandma some direct questions, w/ sensitivity to possible mistreatment in mind as suggested previously. \nShe was adamant there was no malignancy in her home life & after \"forgetting\" probable bio-grandfather for a while, she returned to her previous claim: they'd dated casually to pass the time, that's all.\nI asked again about (previously assumed) Grandpa's deployment to Germany; she wouldn't give dates, but reiterated her insistence he was stateside & they were married by Dad's conception. I'm STILL waiting on a response for that DoD/VA record request. \nA few weeks passed & I'd talked more w/ likely half-aunt. I set aside a time & date w/ grandma to speak candidly & privately (still over the phone, as I work w/ the public & couldn't risk her health by traveling there). She knew what it was about- the \"appointment\" was actually her idea!\nThen... SHE FREAKIN DIED THAT EXACT MORNING.\nGrandma was temporarily in a nursing home while she recovered from a UTI & my aunt was arranging a HHA. The joke now is she just said \"you thought you had me LOL\" and made her exit. \nHer funeral came & went w/ lots of (unrelated) drama. \nHalf brother (from dad) & I decided to shelve the matter indefinitely while affairs were sorted & grieving processed. \nThat lasted about a year before a notoriously chaotic cousin of ours, went & did ALL of the DNA tests on the market- while he is an AH in his own right, he's also *incredibly* intelligent & has undoubtedly put this together by now.\nMy brother & I didn't trust he'd keep the info to himself (especially post funeral drama) & decided it'd be best to get ahead of it.\nI sat Dad down, told him what I knew, what I believed & info obtained from Grandma before her passing, providing him w/ whatever I had by way of documentation. \nHe paced a bit, fiddled w/ knick-knacks, made a couple \"psht... wha?\" faces & kinda shrugged it off. He said wasn't sure he believed it or even cared. I made it clear he wasn't required to follow up in ANY way, but if he had questions I'd help him navigate the data. If he decided to test to remove any doubt, I'd get him one & help him sort that, and his (probable) half sister is open to speaking, sharing info & maybe testing privately. \nThat's it.\nHe hasn't brought it up in the 6 months or so since. Mom says he hasn't w/ her either, but no way to truly know.\n\n\nTL;DR: it didn't happen til I felt my hand was forced, & the conclusion thus far was... anticlimactic? \nThanks again for everyone's input on my OP.", "created_utc": 1690664022, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15d2ma9/update_wibta_if_i_exposed_a_70_yr_family_secret/", "score": 85, "replies": ["He truly may not care. In every way that mattered, the man who raised him was his father.", "There is a point in a man's life where the technicality doesn't matter anymore.  Who we love and hold dear does.  He is happy with his family, just as I would be.  Blood doesn't make family, our connections and who we love does.  For most people that's usually who shares their blood, but sometimes it isn't.  So, the update is, he loves his family regardless of any tests and that's the best you can expect from a good man.", "He could genuinely not care. I found a half brother from my dad's dead beat bio-dad in one of those sites and when I told him, all he did was laugh, and we haven't brought it back up since. Especially if all this drama is happening, he probably isn't particularly interested in re-working his position in this family.", "Have you tried the [National Archives](https://aad.archives.gov/aad/index.jsp) for info on his military stuff? I\u2019m sure it wouldn\u2019t have as much detail as getting an official file but maybe you could find something helpful. When I used it I just put in my great grandfathers name in the search bar and it pulled up any records related to him. Unfortunately there was also that fire in St Louis that destroyed a lot of army and air force records from like the 40s-60s I think. \n\nDNA would be the best way to know for sure tho, of course. I mean, she also could have had an affair while he was home. \n\nSorry you\u2019re having so much family drama, but it sounds like you\u2019re being sensitive in the way you\u2019re handling things with your dad. Hope things turn out well for you all in the end.", "Think the thought of this secret getting out might have caused granny\u2019s timely demise", "Interesting follow up.\n\nI don't think your GM never would have told you the truth.  She didn't want it out.  She didn't want to admit to it.\n\nI am OLD (a child of one who served in WW II) and I get where your father is coming from.  The man he knew has his father raised him. He considers his parents as his parents.  He is old and isn't interested in the past.  He may not want to shame his mother.\n\nYou get to continue the investigation as long as you care to.", "I actually tried getting my dads military records.  It set off so many alarm bells it was funny to watch.  My dad was a cook, turned generals aide of General Hugh Foster in Vietnam.  He said the man was the biggest ass he'd ever had the displeasure of knowing.  He clapped the day he saw the man died before him. But, never been able to get a single piece of paperwork that he didn't personally have himself even after they're both dead and gone.", "That is funny lol. Like RED ALERT!! Someone is\u2026 requesting records through the usual official channels one would be expected to request records through\u2026 I\u2019m guessing they don\u2019t just fax over the whole thing without reviewing it for sensitive info first so like\u2026? I\u2019m not military so maybe this is ignorant on my my part but it seems like a bit of an overreaction lol. \n\nMy great grandfathers records were likely lost in that fire. I think my grandma may have tried to request them at some point. She recently gave me the box with all of his letters from WWII (which I just finished typing up for her) and it also included what seem like his discharge papers and other documents mostly relating to his benefits and a medical report detailing his PTSD symptoms in the 60s when he was applying for additional disability or something. Only thing I would really be interested in would be more details about his time as a POW in Germany (know the camp and time frame but apparently he never talked about his experience), but I don\u2019t know if that type of stuff would have been in that file anyways. \n\nMaybe there\u2019s some sort of time limit and they\u2019ll let you have it one day if you keep bugging them lol.", "I figured it's because it was general level clearance shit.  Also Hugh Foster was responsible for doing Navajo code talker stuff so there's some of it that might still be classified even now.", "Your grandma really went \u201cwe\u2019ll have this conversation over my dead body!\u201d And committed, huh?", "I'm a genealogist by avocation - it doesn't pay enough for a vocation :) - and military records are a pain. They take forever except when they don't and a whole lot of them from that time period were destroyed in a fire in the St Louis records center back in the early 1973. It wiped out 80% of Army personnel files for people discharged between November 1912, and January 1960. For the Air Force, around 75% of personnel discharged from September 1947, through January 1964, with names that began after \u201cHubbard, James,\u201d were lost. There were no duplicates.\n\nI never know what's coming back, when it's coming back, or for these records if it's coming back. One of the great genealogical lotteries, it is. :) Good luck.", "I'm a genealogist by avocation - it doesn't pay enough for a vocation :) - and US  military records are a pain.
