Let\u2019s be honest you won\u2019t be coming home each weekend. Travelling that far each weekend with a 2 year old and when you are studying will not happen. Great grandma will be raising him and this will likely cause some serious attachment issues in the long run. Which could lead to some serious resentment towards you and his younger sister as she will be seen as the child you cared about. I\u2019m saying this from experience with kids I have worked with. \n\nWhat you should do is find a school closer to you , so you can still be in your sons life without being so far away. Reading the post you said it\u2019s the preferred school. You are also a mom with two kids who are relying on you.

Let me tell you about my FIL. his parents left him behind with his grandparents and traveled to California with his baby brother where they lived for a few years because his dad was in the army and was stationed there. My FIL is 84 and STILL has sadness and resentment for the decision his parents made and he is one of the most forgiving people I know. He also took a very long time, decades, to be able to have a decent relationship with his brother. They had three younger  sisters eventually and four kids still live in their home state but my FIL left and never moved back. I think a huge part of that decision had to do with being left behind.", "YTA. You don\u2019t get to abandon your son.", "YTA it's okay to depend on family when you're having a hard time (assuming the family has agreed) but not only doe this feel like you're taking advantage of your grandmother's generosity, but it also feels like you're being incredibly unfair to your children and it's for a selfish reason that you're rationalizing into something selfless, as in, 'I'm getting an education for my kids.'\n\nHigher education for a better paying job is for the good of your kids, of course. But if you do this, you're choosing to abandon your son, because this is only your \"preferred\" school. If there's other schools which allow you to be with both your kids, that's what you choose, because being a parent means putting your kids above your own preferences.\n\nAnd you say it'll only be during the semesters, and you'll go home most weekends, but there's no way that's going to work out like you're making it sound. Five/six hours one way is a looong trip, especially for a weekend, and with a 2 year old and school assignments. There's no way you'll be making it home that often. Imagine how your son will feel when you have time to take your daughter out on a day trip because that takes only half the time you'd need to spend traveling home just to see him, so you end up staying at school with her instead.\n\nEdit: grammar", "YTA.\n\nYour son is 10 years old. It doesn't matter what his opinion on the topic is, if you abandon your son for two years when he's 10, it's going to do serious harm to him.\n\nI kinda have to presume that your children have already had a tumultuous childhood given that you had your first child at 15.", "YTA.  This is selfish.  You're a parent.  Your son and daughter should be your priority.  Figure out a way to get your schooling done locally.  Your poor son.  Also, that's a lot to put on your grandma.

Poor kid", " YWBTAH. \n\nLet me phrase your question a different way. How would you feel if your mother decided to abandon you with relatives at 10 years old (I know you plan on coming home on weekends, but that doesn\u2019t help day in day out), AND took your sibling to live with her?\n\nIf it were me, I would feel like my mother doesn\u2019t loves me, but loves my sibling. Why does she only love my sibling. There must be something wrong with me.\n\nThis plan would do tremendous psychological damage to your son, and probably alter your relationship with him (for the worse) forever.", "YTA. Kids come first. Find a school closer to home/remote learning or relocate to where both your children can be there.\n\nYou're essentially asking if YTA for abandoning your son....so yeah. Pretty obvious there, your children are your responsibility, you don't get to leave any of them behind. I feel bad for your son that you're even considering this.", "YTA, you\u2019re the parent, not your grandmother. Also, why not apply close to home? Why 5-6 hours away? This not only affects your ten year old, but now you want to take your two year old away from her home, and the people she\u2019s comfortable with?", "YTA. Don\u2019t consider schools that are outside of commuting distance. You chose to have two children and need to put them above your desires.", "YWBTA. You should have finished your education before having 2 children. Absolutely DO NOT ask for his opinion. He will know what you want him to say and will say it to make his mom happy. Then you get to ease your conscience by saying he told you it was ok to dump him on Grandma. Go to school in your area and commute like every other parent who goes back to school does.", "YTA.  It is commendable that you have finished your 2 yr degree and i know the last ten years most likely have been difficult for you.  \n\nHowever, i think it will be harder on you & your daughter to be 5-6 hrs away for your school.  Who will take care of your daughter while you are in class and doing homework?  If you have to pay someone then you may have to get a job to afford  childcare and to pay for food housing gas back & forth on weekends.  what child wants to sit still for 5-6,hrs on a fri to go see your son and then another 5-6 hrs on sun when you drive back to school? \n\n I think your daughter may develop separation anxiety from being away from your son & grandmother, & you while you are in class and maybe working too.  This doesnt include your son may feel abandoned if you leave him and your grandmother & uncle may not want the cost &  responsibility of looking after him in your absence.\n\nAre your children's dad(s) in the picture? Do they pay child support or have joint custody of either child? Can they help in any way?\n\nIn my opinion, a better solution is to stay with your grandmother get a job with your  2 yr degree while simultaneously working toward an online 4yr degree or by going to a local university that is within driving distance.  This way your kids arent separated from each other or from you, the responsibility of raising your son doesnt fall on your grandmother, his great-grandmother who may be tired of raising kids at this point in her life.  This way you have support for your daughter& son, and you are still working towards your goal, but at a slower pace.\n\nYou may also consider something like army or coast guard reserves where you go once a month over a weekend, receive pay& training, and then after 2 yrs you will receive benefits that will pay for college.", "Why did you have a kid if you have to ABANDON them?\n\nYou made your bed by getting pregnant and keeping it.

YTA.", "INFO: have you asked your son his perspective? I\u2019d say this highly depends on your family dynamic. 10 isn\u2019t too young to have a conversation with him? He might prefer to stay with grandma and in his school. I don\u2019t think your logic is wrong but he should have a say. But also why can\u2019t you have two kids in a studio or one bedroom? Especially if you spend weekends in a larger house? Also sometimes if you have funding for school you count both kids as dependents and you qualify for more government grants. You can also apply for bursaries. There\u2019s free money everywhere in university (in my experience at least).", "YTA, not for wanting to get a higher education but for wanting to leave your kid behind to do it.

I am not seeing any reason why this far away school should be the choice over an online option. Do the school online and keep your family together. \n\nINFO: Why is this one school your preferred option over ones that are closer to home?\n\nI\u2019m open to a no vote here. Being a single parent is tough, and parents throughout history have sacrificed time away from family to better their lives and the lives of their families. If this school is the key to a brighter future for you all, and the best way to make it work is making a huge family sacrifice, it may be worth it in your situation. \n\nThat being said, you\u2019re saying there are online and local options. The only real jobs where school matters are high-end law and medical. If you\u2019re getting a nursing degree for instance, no one cares what nursing school you went to. They want to see you have the degree and passed your boards. \n\nSo, why do you want to go to this other school? Because you truly believe this school will unlock some better future for your family? Or because you like the location, campus, culture, etc better? If it\u2019s the former, you may have to go for it.

My dad had to move halfway across the country for work for a couple years when I was a toddler and I have a good amount of friends that had years of their childhood where they didn\u2019t live with their parents (and with other family instead) due to various reasons.   \n    \nSometimes life happens, and if it\u2019s for a good reason and will positively impact the rest of your guys\u2019 lives, I think you should go for it. Obviously depends on what your other closer options are but I don\u2019t think doing this is out of the question at all", "INFO-- how does your son feel about the idea?", "The fact that you even had to ask. Yes, YTA for abandoning him. Fair warning, don't be surprised when he goes NC with you if you plan to go through with it.", "Yta, when you ask your son if he's ok with you abandoning him are you going to accept the answer if he says no or try and talk him into it so you can get your way?.\n\nAre you willing to risk your relationship with your son and his relationship with his sister by leaving him behind and taking her with you?", "YTA; and it shows your son you love your daughter more since you're not leaving her behind. Will she not need daycare?", "YTA.  \n\nYou might think your idea makes sense logically, but it will not make sense to a child. He will only see it one way : That he was left behind.\n\nEspecially the fact that you want to take your daughter and leave your son. How do you think this will look and feel to him??? \n\nHe will forever wonder why you left him behind. I think this would be a very destructive to your son if you did this.\n\nI did not grow up with my mother due to choices she made and I still resent her for it and I am in my late 30's. I will never forgive her for leaving.  A part of me hates her. If she had had another child that she had taken with her I would have been even angrier.", "NTA - is it an ideal situation? No, but OP\u2019s son has a stable place to live that he\u2019s familiar with. OP will be visiting often. Also people are forgetting that OP probably would prefer to not have to be away from her son in order to further her education. But that\u2019s life and in order to build a better life for your family small sacrifices are necessary at times.", "You don't seem like a bad person but your plan just isn't a good idea for all the reasons people have (albeit harshly) outlined in other comments.", "I think it depends on how your son and grandparent feels, but a lot of people on this thread seem like they are downplaying how important getting an education could be for your kids. My mom was a single mom and a similar age when she had her two kids and we lived in rural Mississippi so there weren't a ton of colleges around. She pursued a masters degree and while it was really hard at the time and we spent a lot of time with family and/or borderline neglected we are all way better off for it now. It seems like life has delt you a tough hand and you may need to make some difficult decisions to figure out how to best provide for your family in the long term. As long as you genuinely have their best interests in mind I don't think you are the asshole for choosing what you think is best.", "... Did you really just ask if it's OK to abandon your son... YTA", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain and say Not *necessarily* TA. \n\nI\u2019m South Indian, and we emigrated. The concept of leaving children with a trusted family member while the parent(s) seek education, employment, emigrate first etc etc is not foreign to me. I myself lived with my grandmother for a couple of years as a toddler, and then again as a preteen while my parents faced the struggles of moving country, completing degree, getting in employment, finding housing etc. At one point my mother and I moved to another country ahead of time as she had a job ready, while my father and toddler brother followed later. \n\nHowever, it needs to be handled well and considered fully and thoughtfully. \n\nYour plan is meant to be temporary - you said hopefully no more than 2 years, but it involves taking a toddler with you and caring for her alone. Are you being realistic with your timeframe. Because if you say \u201ctemporary\u201d and you say it to your elderly grandma and your own adolescent son, then you need to *mean* temporary. \n\nIs your grandmother happy with the arrangement? Is your uncle, who pays the bills, going to be happy with it to? How will you make sure your son - old enough to feel unwanted - knows that you love him and continues to feel that love? Are you going to face possible tantrums with forbearance?\n\nCan you adequately explain to him why you\u2019re taking your daughter and not him so that he doesn\u2019t feel that you favour her more? \n\nAre you ready to deal with your daughter\u2019s fear? Toddlers are not so young that they don\u2019t notice the world change around them. If she\u2019s attached to her brother and great grandma she\u2019s going to wonder where they are. It\u2019s likely to make her clingier to you. Is this going to affect your work? When my mum and I went first, they tried to explain to my brother, but he was too little to fully understand. To him, his mum and big sister just vanished, and he was scared his dad would next. Started refusing to eat until my dad got home from work. And this was with only a month of separation. \n\nSo is the plan the best thing the world? No. Could it work if you\u2019re careful, think things through, discuss things fully? I think yes. But it is fraught with difficulties", "NTA, if your family is willing.", "YTA. Your son is going to resent this decision and believe that you wanted to stay with the daughter.", "NTA", "Bettering herself and her career isnt abandoning her son. As long as she can still be reached, she still visits and participates in his childhood it's not abandonment. \n\n If the son and grandma are on board it could be better for all of them in the long run. My dad left for 2 years to protect our country, some parents have jobs that require travel, this isn't abandonment, it's more like those things.", "Fr the cost of gas is gonna be so close to what the rent increase would be to get a 2br.", "And who will watch the 2 year old while she's in class? Childcare will cost her.", "The thing that bother me is that she wants to take the 2-yr old daughter with her. Not only would that likely create resentment between siblings, but who is going to care for the child while she is in classes? I don't get it.", "That is not how it will look to the child.", "Her school of choice might be the fact that it has more in-person classes. It might be better for her learning style.", "This. All of these YTAs sound like veiled judgment for being a teenage mother. It\u2019s like people are saying that a person who has a child at 15 should be \u201cpunished\u201d by foregoing the opportunities they lost out on for the rest of their lives. These same people wouldn\u2019t say that about a teenage dad, but would probably be praising him for stepping up. She\u2019s NTA. What I\u2019m curious about is who\u2019s going to be watching the 2 yr old when she\u2019s in class!", "I would call any father an AH for that, particularly for taking one child and not the other.", "It is most likely not a \"dream school\" but a university/college that offers the degree program she is interested in. She could probably get a degree in welding closer to home but if her ambition is engineering....", "She had a choice not to have sex. She had a choice to use protection. She had a choice to use plan B. She (probably, back then) had a choice to do an abortion. She had a choice to give the baby up for adoption. She CHOSE to parent this child. Accept the consequences.\n\nAnd yes I know, there is a chance she was raped but that only took away her first choice, not the rest.\n\nI\u2019m not going to assume she was a helpless victim just because we don\u2019t know the age of the father or whether her parents are religious nutjobs.", "She already has an associates degree. Depending on her chosen field, she could currently find a good job with that education. \n\nWhy are you commenting everywhere and trying to make it seem like she\u2019s fresh out of high school with no credentials?", "You don't know that it was two 14 year olds. We only know that ONE of them was 14.", ">Let me tell you something, from a person who was left with my grandparents so my mom could do whatever it was that was more important than I was. It will cause ever lasting emotional harm to your son. He will grow up feeling unloved, unworthy, and confused.\n\nThis isn't everyone's experience with a mother who leaves to do higher education. Im sorry for you experience and that your mom chose partying over you. You don't know that OP is making this same choice and ite unfair tof you to project those insecurities on to her.", "I actually thought it was a dad when I read it and I still thought they were the AH.  A child doesn't understand these things. They will take it personally.", "Yes, if a father chose to take a job that took him away from one of his children (but not the other) for the majority of the year, most of us would think he was an asshole. Particularly if he had other job options that didn't involve moving hours away and abandoning his kids.", "~~She had a baby at 4 years older than he is now, she deserves a life and her having one will give him more of a chance~~\n\nShe made poor decisions and now has to deal with the consequences of those decisions. FTFY\n\nIn all seriousness tho, she may have been a child when he was conceived but she is an adult now, she can come up with adult solutions that dont involve abandoning her kid to grandma, its HER responsibility to raise her child AND manage her life that seems to be in piecess her wanting to abandon her child is fucked up, shes gotta find a different way to make it work.", "An associate degree might not be enough, especially for today. I'm not saying she's fresh out of highschool, she's 25, she has finished. \n\nWhat she has now might not be enough to get a well paying job. If she gets a well paying job with a better degree she will be able to spend more time with her children in the future.", "The son may never get over being left behind.", "To be honest, I'd be shocked if she made it home every weekend being that it's 5-6 hours away & she has a 2 year old to travel with. That's a lot & I don't really see that happening. The best thing would be going to college close to home so she could commute. Who will watch her daughter while she's in classes too? That'll take money for childcare.", "Yep, a lifetime of abandonment issues for the poor kid. Why did mom love my sister so much more than me?", "she is an adult now", "they sure can", "So if a parent wants their kid to keep the baby, and the parent is financially responsible for the teenager, and the teen is 14, what do you think happens?", "She'll have to leave him with someone else anyways, she'll have to hire a nanny or put him in daycare anyways instead of leaving him with a stranger she can leave with grandmother.She will have to spend any free time taking care to take care of her daughter. A 2 year old needs much more care and attention than a 10 year old.\n\nHer son will have to change schools now and after 2 years again. Unless she's moving permanently, changing schools repeatedly will stress out children. He would have friends and all in this school, changing schools is stressful for them, he might not even try to make friends if he knows he won't stay for long."]}
