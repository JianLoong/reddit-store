Let\u2019s be honest you won\u2019t be coming home each weekend. Travelling that far each weekend with a 2 year old and when you are studying will not happen. Great grandma will be raising him and this will likely cause some serious attachment issues in the long run. Which could lead to some serious resentment towards you and his younger sister as she will be seen as the child you cared about. I\u2019m saying this from experience with kids I have worked with. \n\nWhat you should do is find a school closer to you , so you can still be in your sons life without being so far away. Reading the post you said it\u2019s the preferred school. You are also a mom with two kids who are relying on you.

Let me tell you about my FIL. his parents left him behind with his grandparents and traveled to California with his baby brother where they lived for a few years because his dad was in the army and was stationed there. My FIL is 84 and STILL has sadness and resentment for the decision his parents made and he is one of the most forgiving people I know. He also took a very long time, decades, to be able to have a decent relationship with his brother. They had three younger  sisters eventually and four kids still live in their home state but my FIL left and never moved back. I think a huge part of that decision had to do with being left behind.", "YTA. You don\u2019t get to abandon your son.", "YTA it's okay to depend on family when you're having a hard time (assuming the family has agreed) but not only doe this feel like you're taking advantage of your grandmother's generosity, but it also feels like you're being incredibly unfair to your children and it's for a selfish reason that you're rationalizing into something selfless, as in, 'I'm getting an education for my kids.'\n\nHigher education for a better paying job is for the good of your kids, of course. But if you do this, you're choosing to abandon your son, because this is only your \"preferred\" school. If there's other schools which allow you to be with both your kids, that's what you choose, because being a parent means putting your kids above your own preferences.\n\nAnd you say it'll only be during the semesters, and you'll go home most weekends, but there's no way that's going to work out like you're making it sound. Five/six hours one way is a looong trip, especially for a weekend, and with a 2 year old and school assignments. There's no way you'll be making it home that often. Imagine how your son will feel when you have time to take your daughter out on a day trip because that takes only half the time you'd need to spend traveling home just to see him, so you end up staying at school with her instead.\n\nEdit: grammar", "YTA.\n\nYour son is 10 years old. It doesn't matter what his opinion on the topic is, if you abandon your son for two years when he's 10, it's going to do serious harm to him.\n\nI kinda have to presume that your children have already had a tumultuous childhood given that you had your first child at 15.", "YTA.  This is selfish.  You're a parent.  Your son and daughter should be your priority.  Figure out a way to get your schooling done locally.  Your poor son.  Also, that's a lot to put on your grandma.

Poor kid", " YWBTAH. \n\nLet me phrase your question a different way. How would you feel if your mother decided to abandon you with relatives at 10 years old (I know you plan on coming home on weekends, but that doesn\u2019t help day in day out), AND took your sibling to live with her?\n\nIf it were me, I would feel like my mother doesn\u2019t loves me, but loves my sibling. Why does she only love my sibling. There must be something wrong with me.\n\nThis plan would do tremendous psychological damage to your son, and probably alter your relationship with him (for the worse) forever.", "YTA. Kids come first. Find a school closer to home/remote learning or relocate to where both your children can be there.\n\nYou're essentially asking if YTA for abandoning your son....so yeah. Pretty obvious there, your children are your responsibility, you don't get to leave any of them behind. I feel bad for your son that you're even considering this.", "YTA, you\u2019re the parent, not your grandmother. Also, why not apply close to home? Why 5-6 hours away? This not only affects your ten year old, but now you want to take your two year old away from her home, and the people she\u2019s comfortable with?", "YTA. Don\u2019t consider schools that are outside of commuting distance. You chose to have two children and need to put them above your desires.", "YWBTA. You should have finished your education before having 2 children. Absolutely DO NOT ask for his opinion. He will know what you want him to say and will say it to make his mom happy. Then you get to ease your conscience by saying he told you it was ok to dump him on Grandma. Go to school in your area and commute like every other parent who goes back to school does.", "YTA.  It is commendable that you have finished your 2 yr degree and i know the last ten years most likely have been difficult for you.  \n\nHowever, i think it will be harder on you & your daughter to be 5-6 hrs away for your school.  Who will take care of your daughter while you are in class and doing homework?  If you have to pay someone then you may have to get a job to afford  childcare and to pay for food housing gas back & forth on weekends.  what child wants to sit still for 5-6,hrs on a fri to go see your son and then another 5-6 hrs on sun when you drive back to school? \n\n I think your daughter may develop separation anxiety from being away from your son & grandmother, & you while you are in class and maybe working too.  This doesnt include your son may feel abandoned if you leave him and your grandmother & uncle may not want the cost &  responsibility of looking after him in your absence.\n\nAre your children's dad(s) in the picture? Do they pay child support or have joint custody of either child? Can they help in any way?\n\nIn my opinion, a better solution is to stay with your grandmother get a job with your  2 yr degree while simultaneously working toward an online 4yr degree or by going to a local university that is within driving distance.  This way your kids arent separated from each other or from you, the responsibility of raising your son doesnt fall on your grandmother, his great-grandmother who may be tired of raising kids at this point in her life.  This way you have support for your daughter& son, and you are still working towards your goal, but at a slower pace.\n\nYou may also consider something like army or coast guard reserves where you go once a month over a weekend, receive pay& training, and then after 2 yrs you will receive benefits that will pay for college.", "Why did you have a kid if you have to ABANDON them?\n\nYou made your bed by getting pregnant and keeping it.

YTA.", "INFO: have you asked your son his perspective? I\u2019d say this highly depends on your family dynamic. 10 isn\u2019t too young to have a conversation with him? He might prefer to stay with grandma and in his school. I don\u2019t think your logic is wrong but he should have a say. But also why can\u2019t you have two kids in a studio or one bedroom? Especially if you spend weekends in a larger house? Also sometimes if you have funding for school you count both kids as dependents and you qualify for more government grants. You can also apply for bursaries. There\u2019s free money everywhere in university (in my experience at least).", "YTA, not for wanting to get a higher education but for wanting to leave your kid behind to do it.

I am not seeing any reason why this far away school should be the choice over an online option. Do the school online and keep your family together. \n\nINFO: Why is this one school your preferred option over ones that are closer to home?\n\nI\u2019m open to a no vote here. Being a single parent is tough, and parents throughout history have sacrificed time away from family to better their lives and the lives of their families. If this school is the key to a brighter future for you all, and the best way to make it work is making a huge family sacrifice, it may be worth it in your situation. \n\nThat being said, you\u2019re saying there are online and local options. The only real jobs where school matters are high-end law and medical. If you\u2019re getting a nursing degree for instance, no one cares what nursing school you went to. They want to see you have the degree and passed your boards. \n\nSo, why do you want to go to this other school? Because you truly believe this school will unlock some better future for your family? Or because you like the location, campus, culture, etc better? If it\u2019s the former, you may have to go for it.
