We signed the lease and everything. Only down side is that it's a no dogs building. Which is fine for my partner and I since we aren't planning to get a dog just yet. \n\nMy friend who has the sweetest golden retriever ever is pushing me about letting her dog still come over to hang out when she comes over. This is fine in my current apartment since dogs are allowed. I told her the dog can't come over anymore since it's a no dogs allowed building. And she kept saying that she doesn't know of any apartment complexes that are against a dog just visiting for a a short time and it's fine if they aren't staying long term. I told her no because I'm not willing to risk getting kicked out of this place. (Its a besutiful apartment thay is perfect for my partner and I). And my thinking if that yes this apartment company is dog friendly but only certain buildings. So people are obviously choosing this building to be away from dogs and people could have severe allergies or fears or anything else. \n\nNote: the apartment is going to be on the third floor so it would be quite hard to hide an 80 lb dog while getting to said apartment. \n\nBut she got fairly mad at me that I don't want him to come over once we move.

You have said \"no\" and that should be the end of it.\n\nNo one has the right to insist that another person allow an animal into their home.\n\nI don't allow dogs in my house.  Full stop.", "NTA. Why is she being so insistent about this? It's bizarre.", "NTA  your friend is being a jerk.  There's no reason her dog has to visit.  It's a dog, not a child.  You are a good neighbor to realize some of your neighbors are likely in a dog free building for a reason.  Don't risk your living situation over an entitled twit.", ">I told her no \n\nAnd that should have been the end of the discussion. NTA", "NTA. The bigger issue is why she is ok with risking your eviction.", "Can I bring my dog?\nNo.  It's a no pet building. \n\nEnd of discussion. \nNTA", "NTA.\n\nYour friend is acting childish and throwing a tantrum for being told \"No.\" I'm a big animal lover and have a couple of 80-lb dogs myself. Anyone with a dog knows there are just some places they can't (or shouldn't) go. \n\nI have a feeling you should prepare for her to show up with the dog anyway.", "NTA. You told her you didn't want the dog in, that ends the convo.", "Sounds like your friend is one of those people who never met a boundary she didn't attempt to obliterate. You're behaving appropriately. if I were you, I wouldn't discuss it with her again. NTA", "NTA.  There are places were dogs don't belong - your apartment is one of them.  It's not even your rule.  Tell your friend to drop it.", "NTA.  Either a building is animal friendly or not. I think it\u2019s weird that she\u2019s getting angry at you about it. \n\nPreface: I am a dog owner. Have been my entire life. I don\u2019t understand this new trend that pets needs to be with their owners 24/7\n\nOne of my friends has 2 full sized doodles and was telling me how once she got through her training at her new job she was planning on taking her dogs out on all her sales calls. That\u2019s just so bizarre to me. I can\u2019t imagine leaving my dog in the car all day while i was in/out of client offices and meetings. Or taking them in to the office on a sales call. \n\nNTA", "Nta, she needs to drop this and respect both your decision and the rules of your complex. It is her choice and right to center her world around her dog but to expect others to is absurd.", "NTA ofcourse. From my experience though, my friend steps by to my place with his dog often, my apartment also doesn't let pets so I agree with your friend about that policy being long term. However I didn't have any fear of loosing my apartment like you do. So your friend should respect that.", "NTA. This is out of your hands. It's unfortunate, but a lot of landlords don't allow pets. I had one who wouldn't even let me babysit a friend's cat when he had to go out of town briefly \"in case a future tenant has a cat allergy\". I found this to be seriously over the top, but it was her house, and she lived on the second floor. There was nothing I could do about it that wouldn't carry a serious risk of being kicked out.", "NTA and as someone who lives in a dog-free condo complex that is CONSTANTLY being overrun with visitors\u2019 dogs\u2026 thank you.", "Nta", "Nta. In my short life it has gone from an absolute given you don\u2019t even ask to bring dogs to mo fos showing up at my apartment high rise with animals unannounced. For some reason folks have a way harder time with the fact that some folks don\u2019t want dogs around them at home or eating out.", "NTA\n\nYou told her no, you even gave her the reason why and she is telling you \u201coh, don\u2019t worry about it\u201d\n\nIf a building had a no smoking policy, would she say that doesn\u2019t apply to guests that visit that smoke? It\u2019s not her rule/boundary to decide about. You are the one that could be impacted if someone reports you to the building management.\n\nUnless your building has it written somewhere that dogs are allowed to visit for short period of times, a no dog building is a no dog building. \n\nVisit at her home or a park if she needs to bring the dog at all times.", "NTA. Non-service dogs can\u2019t come everywhere with us. That\u2019s just how it is.", "NTA\n\nNo dogs is no dogs.\n\n More than likely the apartment complex will solve a problem even if it was a service dog.\n\nI have heard of apartment complexes like that\n\nYour friend needs to learn how to leave her dog at her house.", "I\u2019d suggest you meet her in a park or dig friendly restaurant from now on. She should not get mad at you for following the rules of your landlord.", "No she can\u2019t bring the dog, end of story, NTA", "NTA that\u2019s so selfish of your friend to ignore the rules and potentially get you kicked out. It would be a different story if her dog was a service animal.", "There's no other side. I love my dog, but get annoyed at people who feel the need to bring their dog everywhere (service animals aside, before people pretend they don't know what I'm talking about). NTA", "NTA. The entitled attitude that some people have is disgusting.", "NTA\n\nJust be ready when she just shows up with her dog.", "Not the asshole. No dog = no dog. She should respect it - you gave her valid reasons, explained and counter the claim about not wanting to see the dog. She can come without the pet. On the side note, I really don\u2019t understand the problem and the reason why your friend would be so pushy - I read the post and I know the situation but still hard to believe people may be like that - is it entitlement or arrogance? It can\u2019t be a positive thing.", "nta\n\nif it were a trained service animal that would be different, but pets do not get to go everywhere their humans do. the end. friends don\u2019t get to dictate if your house is a place their pets can be. the end.", "NTA I think people who bring their pets to other people's homes whether the person in that home like or not are rude and presumptuous. If your apartment doesn't allow for animals and you don't want to chance it your friend should respect that.", "NTA. Dog people really are extra.", "NTA your friend is acting entitled.  Don't engage with her if she brings it up again.  I would start questioning how good of a friend she actually is as she keeps pushing your boundaries.", "Unless it's officially a support animal, real job real vest, not a ESA Chiwawa in a purse, you are right.

Is it worth risking being evicted just to appease the fury oif this termagant you call a friend? It isn't about her dog. It's about her ego. She heard the word NO and now she's fighting for power over you.\n\nStop arguing with her. Stop giving reasons. These reasons don't matter to her. And she won';t stop pushing at you till you surrender.\n\nSome friend.", "NAH.
