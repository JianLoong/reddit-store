If your lease says no dogs on the premises and you permit her to bring her dog you could be evicted for violating the terms of your lease.\n\nYou could have to pay the rent until the owner found a new tenant.\n \nYou would certainly find it extremely difficult to find a new place to rent with an eviction on your record.", "Make plans outside,  not at home. Or go to her place.", "You are going to piss off all your neighbours if they see or hear a dog with you in the building.\n\nWhy does your friend want to do this to you?", "NTA\n\n>And she kept saying that she doesn't know of any apartment complexes that are against a dog just visiting for a a short time and it's fine if they aren't staying long term.\n\nI do, one my uncle lived in for a few years. He had a friend come over with a new puppy to show my uncle (I  happened to be visiting at the time), it was in my uncles lease that there were no dogs allowed. My uncles apartment was very near the main office to the complex and within 5 minutes of the puppy being there one of the office ladies stuck a violation notice on his door warning him to get rid of the dog by a certain time or get evicted. (Knew it was 5 minutes because the friend forgot something in his car and went back to get it and the notice was on the door. )", "NTA, but can you check with your property management company to ask if your friend can bring her dog for a visit? They might approve that, as long as the dog is only visiting. My mom's condo is dog-free, but my sister brings her dogs to visit often, and as long as she takes them home with her after her visit, they don't have any problems", "NTA, but is it an ESA? At least where I'm from landlords can't do anything about ESA's, and realistically living in an apartment you are going to have people over to visit (with the possibility that they do have an ESA) so that could be a loophole if you actually want to see the dog but are genuinely worried about the landlords.", "FYI (at least in my area) -  \u201cno dog/pet\u201d buildings are around ownership vs visitors, so if you want the dog to be able to come over, you might be okay. However you\u2019re FULLY within your rights to not want that (whether to not potentially annoy building tenants or because you don\u2019t want dog fur in your new home or for any other reason). Be ready for her to come over less because of it (eg if the dog has already been home alone for a good portion of the day) - maybe plan to meet at dog friendly patios or her place instead ?", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m very much a dog person, my sweet pup is my best friend, but I still understand that he can\u2019t go everywhere with me. People who act like this make the rest of us look bad.", "I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s a reason she\u2019s being so insistent... For some reason she feels like she can\u2019t hang out at OP\u2019s apartment unless her dog comes along. Maybe because she can\u2019t leave her dog alone at home to visit OP? Now she\u2019s mad she can no longer go to OP\u2019s apartment. OP is moving apartments, so the apartment itself isn\u2019t what she\u2019s interested in\u2026 So, what is she interested in? OP have a nice setup for hanging out? Free food and drinks? OP\u2019s partner? There\u2019s something she\u2019s being denied now and she\u2019s not happy about it", "Idk if it's to me or more so because she knows how much I love that dog. And she comes over often and I guess likes bringing him with.", "Lease says no dogs unfortunately.", "Here only service animals are allowed.", "Because OP had the gall to say no. Some people feel that no doesn't apply to them.", "This. Friend is kind of spoiled, I a weird way. Nit a money way, in a way where no one tells her no. Or she gets what she wants to do. And lately I've been telling her no.", "100% agree, but those types of people typically are benefiting from something in the relationship because they\u2019re selfish. Escape from a roommate? Free food? There\u2019s something she was benefiting or getting from going to OP\u2019s apartment that she\u2019s no longer getting", "Like you, I'm curious about what that could be.", "Idk if it's my apartment, only say that cause hers is alot nicer than mine. And it's not like she won't continue to only talk about herself if her dog isn't at my new place. So I have no idea.", "It sounds like your friend has some narcissistic qualities about her. Maybe you're one of the few people who listen to her monologue.", "NTA. My building is also \"no dogs\". I go for walks with dog-owning friends, or visit their place. They don't come into my apartment building with their dogs, because that's the rule.", "NTA\n\nI know a landlord that gave one of my neighbors shit for their sister bringing her service dog. some places are really anti dog.", "NTA. I am a dog lover but would never disrespect the rules of someone else's home. Stick to your rules.", "Yeah that was the plan! I gave her options and said I would come over!", "I\u2019m a cat owner \u2026\n\nWait. My cat overlords want to have a word with me", "NTA. Every place I've rented had in the lease that animals not registered to the apartment cannot be in the apartment.", "NTA.  No is a complete sentence.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s your home and you can decide if you want to allow dogs in it. \n\nBut side note: this probably depends where you live but I live in Canada (ON) and landlords put no pets in leases sometimes but they\u2019re legally not allowed to actually enforce that. So them putting it in the lease is just trying to trick you but legally they can\u2019t do it. \n\nRegardless, your friend needs to respect your wishes. It\u2019s not that hard to leave the dog at home.", "NTA. The sense of entitlement is strong. If she can\u2019t accept that her dog is not allowed and it isn\u2019t a risk you\u2019d be willing to take, she either leaves the dog home or doesn\u2019t visit.", "NTA\n\nYou are simply following the rules of your new apartment. It\u2019s childish of your friend being so entitled & doesn\u2019t think rules apply to her also! \nHer actions could also jeopardize your domestic stability if they catch you and kick you out (more likely, a warning/fine, but you never know!)\n\nSide note: if OPs friend wants to be able to take her dog more places that don\u2019t typically allow dogs, she may want to look into having it evaluated and registered as an Emotional Support Animal. Of course, she would have to have a valid reason for that\u2026I\u2019m definitely NOT suggesting she do that just so the rules won\u2019t apply to her.", "Jesus, I have a 10 lb dog that fits in a bag but I don't bring her places. How hard is it to follow rules??", "Then you're doing her and the world a favor by educating her in the meaning of NO. Stay strong. NTA."]}
