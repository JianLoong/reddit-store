I still have a few things that used to belong to Julie, including this one cocktail dress. I didn\u2019t keep it for sentimental reasons, I just really like the dress and am hoping to wear it myself after losing a few pounds.\n\nSo my girlfriend Michelle and I were at my apartment when one of our friends texted to invite us to a come out to a club, but it\u2019s a place with a dress code. Michelle was complaining about having to go back to her apartment to change, so I told her that I had a dress she could borrow and gave her the one that used to belong to Julie.\n\nWhen we were out with our friends one of them said to Michelle, \u201cYour dress is really cute.\u201d Michelle said, \u201cThanks, it\u2019s actually OP\u2019s.\u201d Our friend said to me, \u201cOh, really? I\u2019ve never seen you wear it.\u201d I said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t actually fit me yet, it used to be Julie\u2019s.\u201d Michelle looked kind of surprised but she didn\u2019t say anything about it in that moment.\n\nA little while later Michelle said she was going to the bathroom, but then a couple of minutes after that she texted me from an Uber and said she wasn\u2019t feeling well and was going home. I called her to see if she was okay and she said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you wouldn\u2019t tell me that this was Julie\u2019s dress. That\u2019s a really uncomfortable thing to keep me in the dark about.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I guess I didn\u2019t think about it.\u201d Michelle said, \u201cYou should\u2019ve thought about it, it\u2019s pretty fucked not to think about it.\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that big a deal, is it?\u201d Michelle said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to fight with you in an Uber, I\u2019ll talk to you tomorrow.\u201d\n\nSo we haven\u2019t talked about it yet, but before we do I wanted to hear what people think.

She didn\u2019t create drama but stepped away from the situation in order to have time to process her feelings. \n\nThe fact that she referred to your deceased former gf by name suggests that Julie is still a fairly important part of your life.  I have no idea how your current girlfriend feels about Julie\u2019s memory, or if she is threatened by or if she felt it was maybe disrespectful for her to wear a dress or what\u2019s going on.\n\nAs such, it\u2019s hard to judge her reaction.

She should have had the opportunity to decline wearing it. You know that don't you?", "Yea YTA- I know you didn't mean any harm by it but you messed up in a couple ways. \n\nYou shouldn't have let her wear the dress in the first place.

But I can certainly see your POV, especially if it\u2019s a dress Julie didn\u2019t wear all the time or if it was something you would have bought for yourself at the mall or thrifting or whatever.\n\nI think you just need to explain to Michelle that in your eyes, it was just a dress. You didn\u2019t think of any attachment to Julie when keeping the dress because you just liked the way it looked.

Someday, hopefully.\" and just kept the dress's history out of it altogether, especially since you didn't tell your other friend that this used to be Julie's dress.\n\nI honestly also don't think you were being TA here. It's just a dress. You didn't keep it for sentimental reasons. You didn't think deeply about the dress's history when you nicely offered it to Michelle to wear, knowing it would probably be a good fit on her. IDK why the other friend felt the need to comment they've never seen you wear it ... like, okay? You've probably not seen me wear a lot of clothes I own? I also think Michelle overreacted. It's just a dress.", "It might not only be because it was a former gf dress, but also some people feel odd wearing dead peoples clothes or even owning anything from a deceased person they didn't know.

The fact that you can\u2019t comprehend why someone would be uncomfortable at best and terrified at worst is absolutely bonkers to me. \n\nYou secretly put your current girlfriend in your dead former partners dress and then paraded her around town. You dressed her up like a doll as if you wanted her to be your former partner. If I say it like that you get it right?

It\u2019s really not that big a deal.", "sheesh was your ex named Rebecca?? /s", "YTA. You seriously don't see how your girlfriend would be uncomfortable wearing a dress that belongs to your deceased girlfriend???? Are you normally this callous?", "YTA people are funny about death.  \n\nNot wanting to unknowingly wear the dress of a dead woman seems like a fairly  normal reaction to me.  \n\nIt is illogical but common.", "YTA\n\nYou should have told her. Personally I would feel weird and almost disrespectful to wear something of a deceased person.", "NTA cuz you didnt think it would be a problem but it probably would have been better to give her a heads up about where the dress came from and let her choose. but in my opinion she did overreact when she found out.", "It's a huge deal and you should have told her.  I would be totally upset about this.\n\nDo you think your girlfriends are interchangeable and you can just keep shit from other partners and pretend it didn't come from former partners? Especially ones who passed away.\n\nThis makes it seem like you want your new partner to dress up like your dead one and that you haven't processed grief properly and should not be in a relationship.", "NTA.\n\nI might have stuck with, \u201cit doesn\u2019t really fit me right now,\u201d but it\u2019s a dress.", "NTA. She overreacted, she should\u2019ve talked to you about it instead of just bolting.

I think here it's important that for you it's just a dress, an item you like. It's not exactly memory of the person for you and it's not like you want to see your late gf in the one wearing it. So I fail to see anything improper or creepy. It's unfortunate that Michelle reacted like this, but for me it's understandable you didn't expected any problems and it slipped out of your mind to warn her. Explain all this to her and I hope she wouldn't pout a lot. \n\nI've also used some belongings of my bf's ex that meant nothing to him and were still present just because of his laziness.

The fact that her current gf and friend at the bar both knew who Julie was, strongly suggests that the OP talks about her a lot. \n\nGlad I could help!", "She overreacted because she got upset and left over a dress that wasn't anything more then a dress to someone just cuz she did it classy doesn't mean she didn't over react to the situation", "Yeah it seems like an unavoidable breakdown in communication based on two people with different personalities.", ">but I know exactly where my crazy ass thoughts would go in a situation like this. Because it's not just an ex but an ex who passed away while they were still together and if it was a good relationship it might still exist if she was here. Not knowing that I was wearing their clothes would make me feel like I was being purposefully dressed as them- like a placeholder for the partner who can't be there. Was this a dress she wore on special occasions? An anniversary?\n\nWow, that sounds *exhausting*. Thanks for the detail.", "No, she said it used to be Julie's when she was pushed because no one had seen her wearing it before. Once they started pushing, that was going to come out because it doesn't fit her yet.", "I haven't worn all of them, so some of them were technically still worn by her last before she died.", "This is still astonishingly dense to me. I think it's pretty understandable that the current girlfriend would reasonably know the name of a previously dead partner, and that friend could have been friends with OP for a really long time and also known Julie themselves. To automatically assume because simply someone's name was used, that it means they're always talking about them, is just really out there.", "While I agree people shouldn\u2019t always jump to \u201cthey\u2019re a creepy axe murderer\u201d scenario, I do think this is information you shouldn\u2019t omit. I empathize that she didn\u2019t think of it, and I don\u2019t think it should have been a humungous deal, BUT a \u201cHey, I have this dress but it is Julie\u2019s, is that okay with you? I really only kept it cause I wanted to wear it someday but I get if that makes you feel weird.\u201d To omit it and then she finds out in public, in front of friends, wearing the dress with no Plan B, she sort of put her in a weird position to process. I may not be opposed to wearing a dead ex\u2019s attire, but I sure as heck would be if my partner didn\u2019t tell me until I was in a situation I couldn\u2019t do anything about it especially if I did feel some type of way wearing it. OP sorta took that choice away from her gf, y\u2019know. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unfair to expect OP to know some people might not be okay wearing something like that, even if it wouldn\u2019t matter to her. A lot of people are weird with death (In the states at least) and even more so with their belongings.", "I'm positive it was more exhausting for the people around me haha it's just like any other unhelpful thought now", "People would appreciate if you told them that before they wore them ....", "I can see that side of things. Thanks for the explanation! Mainly just disliked that they made like 3 comments implying op was a creep out to transform her current gf into her late gf. Very insensitive", "Thanks for the explanation. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m neurodivergent myself and I don\u2019t really understand the problem here. A little bit, but only depending on how important this former girlfriend is to the OP. In other words, if she talks about her all the time, and still seems like she\u2019s holding feelings or something; I could understand why the current girlfriend would be uncomfortable wearing her dress.", "Np! Someone else also explained to me that it may be a death thing in general. Some people don't feel comfortable wearing or owning items that belong to someone who died, which made sense to me", "Eh, I dunno NTA. It's a dress. It's not like the ex died in the dress.", "op=YTA\n\nFrom Michelle's perspective it's pretty darn creepy.  She's got to be wondering, if you are that attached to Julie still that you have the dress.  Or that you are trying to make her INTO Julie.\n\nYour reason may be as innocuous as you say, but she doesn't know that.  And because you didn't disclose ahead of time and LET HER DECIDE if she was comfortable wearing a dead woman's dress--she doesn't trust you now.", "Actually, late gf.  Not former *or* ex.", "How is she not former?", "former = ex\n\nYou got the terminology wrong, but your heart was in the right place.", "The same way she's not an ex", "And you have a gift for hyperbole :)\n\nYes, she would reasonably know the name of the dead partner because the OP was talking about her a lot.  The girlfriend died \u201ca few years ago,\u201d which would imply at least three years or more. \n\nNo reason for the girlfriend and other friend to remember the name to the point of instant recall the moment it was mentioned.", "???? Do you automatically not recognize names of people who have been out of your life for more than 3 years? My friends and I can bring up people from 10 years ago and instantly know who it was - much less if it was someone who died. There's only ever confusion when there's another person with the same name, and even then, we know both and can clarify which. I really, don't understand your point of view. I would hope 3 years after my death people still remember who I was. Jeez.", "And the reason that you and your friends can recall these people is because they were talked about a lot. The dead girlfriend should\u2019ve been virtually meaningless to the new girlfriend and to the friend as well, unless she was really important and talked about a lot. \n\nBut honestly, this is not worth getting worked up over. You\u2019re like, upset about this lol."]}
