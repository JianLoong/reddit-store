For several years our relations are complicated, and the cohabitation is difficult. I think we're both responsible, but I feel like I've been making a lot of effort lately to work things out while she continues to put me down constantly.\n\nImportant thing : my sister has had a bladder problem for several years and almost no one knows about it. I don't have the details, but she has trouble holding it in and has to wear diapers. I really feel sorry for her because she seems to be suffering from it (she often runs to the bathroom all of a sudden or looks visibly embarrassed, which also makes her very aggressive but I can understand that).\n\nYesterday she is at home with 2 friends. I go into the room, greet her nicely and as usual she puts me down and tells me : \"I know you think you're in a hotel here but you can thank me, I washed your mug that was lying around\". I thanked her so as not to make her even more angry, and she continued in the same tone, telling her friends in front of me \"frankly, my parents never sheltered me as much as they did her., I don't know how she's going to do when she's on her own! I mean, if that ever happens, she doesn't seem to be in a hurry to finish her studies\".\n\nIt was too much for me. This was one gratuitous criticism too many, I felt the anger rising and I said to her coldly \"it is because it makes you anxious that we discover that you wear diapers that you are so aggressive?\" I immediately regretted my words, I was no longer myself and I was in tears because every day she puts me down like that. Julie stood up, red with shame, and came over to yell at me before telling her friends to leave. Since then we don't talk anymore and I don't know what to do.

Me personally, I wouldn\u2019t even let the verbal bullying get that far for how long this has been happening and cut her off in an instant. \n\nHer having that condition with her body should not be an excuse as to why she gets aggressive with people in general.

If OP's sister is continually saying hurtful things and using a nasty tone if voice, how is that not verbal abuse?", "The sister is exhibiting a pattern of constant and consistent verbal abuse; it is not diluting the meaning to call it like it is.", "Seems like it has been like that since basically ever, so yeah kind of applies here.", "Sounds abusive to me, and I spent two years being verbally and mentally abused by a narcissist", "Thanks", "Because then they are going to hit you 100 times harder, so you hit 1000 times harder and on and bloody on until people are killing each other.\n\nYou train people to be wary of escalting a conflict by fighting back stronger but proportionally with the threat of further escalation.", "Fire can be used to fight forest fires, albeit with a certain amount of risk -some thing online :0", "The names!!!!!!!! I love yoooooooooouuuuuuu!!!!!", "Mhm\n\nThe sister whose been making an effort to mend bridges and the sister who actively puts the other down are sooooo similar.

Abusive situations *often* have a power imbalance, but it's not an 100% thing. \n\nAnd regardless of that the Older/Younger sibling dynamic is also often a power imbalance, especially if one of the two is favored (or perceived to be) than the other.", "when those abusive traits are targeted at you, you think you're not being abused by that person?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nridiculous\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP said the sister regularly verbally abuses her. the sister is abusive.", "Do you not have siblings? There is often power imbalance between siblings based on age.", "You are wildly wrong. We don't know enough to say there is so abuse here.
