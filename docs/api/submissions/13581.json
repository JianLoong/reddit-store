For several years our relations are complicated, and the cohabitation is difficult. I think we're both responsible, but I feel like I've been making a lot of effort lately to work things out while she continues to put me down constantly.\n\nImportant thing : my sister has had a bladder problem for several years and almost no one knows about it. I don't have the details, but she has trouble holding it in and has to wear diapers. I really feel sorry for her because she seems to be suffering from it (she often runs to the bathroom all of a sudden or looks visibly embarrassed, which also makes her very aggressive but I can understand that).\n\nYesterday she is at home with 2 friends. I go into the room, greet her nicely and as usual she puts me down and tells me : \"I know you think you're in a hotel here but you can thank me, I washed your mug that was lying around\". I thanked her so as not to make her even more angry, and she continued in the same tone, telling her friends in front of me \"frankly, my parents never sheltered me as much as they did her., I don't know how she's going to do when she's on her own! I mean, if that ever happens, she doesn't seem to be in a hurry to finish her studies\".\n\nIt was too much for me. This was one gratuitous criticism too many, I felt the anger rising and I said to her coldly \"it is because it makes you anxious that we discover that you wear diapers that you are so aggressive?\" I immediately regretted my words, I was no longer myself and I was in tears because every day she puts me down like that. Julie stood up, red with shame, and came over to yell at me before telling her friends to leave. Since then we don't talk anymore and I don't know what to do. I think I did wrong, but at the same time I feel like it was my only tool to counteract her attitude towards me.\n\nTL;DR : My sister keeps putting me down.

Me personally, I wouldn\u2019t even let the verbal bullying get that far for how long this has been happening and cut her off in an instant. \n\nHer having that condition with her body should not be an excuse as to why she gets aggressive with people in general.

Somehow my mom and the other sibling figured out how to manage their emotional response - prob why the attention turned (more often than not) to me and my dad. It SUCKED.  It wasnt until years after my dad died (I hate neither he nor I figured out we could commiserate before he passed) that I was able to unpack HOW sibling did what they did and could, therefore, make sure I was not putting myself in situations where they could be a jackwagon to me.  \n\nSo yeah, do not assume Julie\u2019s parents knew.

She says being put down publicly and verbally abused is routine lol.", "Yup, but the mature thing to do would be to walk away from that relationship. Doing the same thing back just means you are just as bad.", "Or that's how abuse victims react, but you know blame the victim. OP said this has been going on and it doesn't sound recent.", "My sisters have bullied me so much I don\u2019t even try to argue or defend myself anymore, it only leads to them being crueler. That\u2019s how abuse works", "Same, dude, same.", "Mostly because OP flat admits in their post that she's shitty to her sister too. Just because she's *\"trying to be better now\"* doesn't wipe away what I imagine is a lifetime of them both being crappy people.", "Agreed. It sounds like verbal abuse to me having experienced similar with an SO who would verbally terrorize me nightly.\n\nHe was a heavy drinker though. He was unhappy with himself (as it sounds like the older sister is in OP's situation - likely as a result of her incontinence issues), and he would berate me and put me down constantly, until I ultimately burst out and exploded back.\n\nI, too, hit below the belt in my situation and said something embarrassing and hurtful - spiteful even.  I just couldn't take being treated that way anymore. So I finally fought back, and in those same, ugly words, and tone of voice that he used with me.\n\nReactive abuse is real, and it is also different in every situation\n\nOP, I feel that NTA, here. You can only take so much her, and that your sister is lashing out at you because of her own personal insecurities \n\nGive your sister (and yourself, as well) time to calm down after this. Take a few deep, steadying breaths. Recollect yourself. You both need some space. Life is hard for all of us, especially with the state of the world, on a global scale. \n\nMaybe she's lashing out because of what she is going through physically. Maybe it is a painful (and obviously embarrassing) condition - to her.  Long-term, ongoing pain can change a person, especially if there is no outlet for the pain, no comfort, no relief.\n\nPerhaps her \"bladder\" issue could be IC, or Interstitial Cystitis. I suffered from IC for a year and a half about 10 years ago. It felt like having a constant UTI that NEVER went away for the entire 19 months that I dealt with the symptoms. There is continuous pain, burning, pressure, and some incontinence, that just never stops. No matter the treatment, the symptoms are almost never fully resolved. \n\nMaybe you could just give her some time to cool down, apologize honestly, and from the heart. Ask her if you two could talk, and say to her that you understand she is going through some stuff medically, and just simple ask her if she is OK? What's wrong? Maybe she needs someone to open up to about her personal situation (that sometimes only a family member could understand) without being judgemental?\n\nSorry for such a long post, but OP's situation hit close to home, and I felt I could offer some insight.", "I always thought it meant everyone's shitty here lol \ud83d\ude2c", "Imagine blaming the victim of abuse for being abused.. what an absolute cretin.", "Nope. Again, if you decide to bully someone, especially with an audience, you don\u2019t get to cry about what they retaliate with. Don\u2019t want your medical issues thrown in your face? Don\u2019t throw other people\u2019s issues in their face", "It worked.", "She called her an incompetent adult, berated her schooling and patted herself on the back for washing a mug! OP was gracious until the last comment. Anything goes at that point.", "Why not? If someone verbally berates you all the time while you can't react (for any reason) , it takes its toll and that's when you clap back hard, cuz you had enough of that shit. \nMaybe you never experienced it or belong to Julie's category.", "I mean that's a very immature way of looking at it. You are the better person by walking away you don't need anyone's validation for that.", "People can have the most wonderful parents in the world and still be AHs. Some people just don\u2019t mix. I can\u2019t imagine getting along with my sibling and I don\u2019t think they are a bad person, just annoying.", "A bullied person retaliating is not anywhere near as bad as the person bullying", "It's still abuse, even if OP was a crappy person. Verbally berating someone and putting them down constantly is abusive.", "Abusive situations aren\u2019t defined by a power imbalance. \n\nI hid from my younger sister because she attacked me so much. First verbally, and I wanted to get away from what she said. Escalated to physical. She ended up coming at me with a knife. My parents thought I over reacted until my much younger brother said something. \n\nNo power imbalance. Still abusive. I was the one \u201cin charge\u201d when we were left alone. My parents just thought I was exaggerating. We would be told off the same. My parents have since apologised.", ">there is a difference between an abusive situation/relationship and an individual displaying abusive traits. \n\n\n\nMaybe you have been in an abusive relationship or had an abuser, maybe not. \n\nYou don't get to gatekeep how a person reacts to either an abusive situation or an abuser. If your threshold is 100 (good for you) there's could be 4. \n\nOp was repeatedly put down by her sister. In this situation, she hit back.

Now what?", "These are both minors.\n\nThe real question is, why are the parents not getting their daughters abusive traits looked into?", "i think people are very eager to pathologise these issues because it brings them comfort: however this is not how reactive abuse works! reminds me of people who misuse \u201cgaslighting\u201d to be honest.", "Sometimes, that's the way. And this doesn't prove she looks down on her medical issues,  it's about retaliating against the shit her sister does EVERY DAY. She might not have said anything to keep the peace earlier because of their parents or any other reason, but her sister abused that. \nShe also had to hear her shit only because her financial conditions weren't great, isn't that out her control too? Why should she be bullied?\nOP, what your did wasn't a 100% correct choice but I'll still support it because sometimes that's what you have to do to shut someone up.
