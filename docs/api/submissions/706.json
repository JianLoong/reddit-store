And sorry if this doesn\u2019t make much sense but I\u2019m trying my best. \nBut I (22 F). And my partner (25M) have been close friends with my brother (Jackson 28M ) and his best friend (Alex 29M) for quite some time, we would often play online games together and meet up to hang out and nothing was out of the ordinary.Alex ended up meeting a girl on an online game (Mary 19F) and they started dating. We were supportive and always were around to give them any help and advice they needed.  About 2 years ago we had 2 other friends (Nicole and Michael)  which Jackson, Alex and Mary didn\u2019t like or get along with as they thought they were toxic. After a lot of arguments and fighting me and my partner decided to block and remove Nicole and Michael to make my brother Jackson, Alex and Mary happy. As we both cared very much about how they felt as we have been close for quite some time and they are our family. We would always offer to help them in their times of need and protect them constantly from other people. \n\nRecently however we started to notice a change with Alex and Mary\u2019s behaviour towards us and come to find out about 3 months ago. They have been spreading rumours and making nasty comments about myself and my partner which weren\u2019t true.

I\u2019m absolutely broken because I spent years defending the three of them and I also cut out friends for them, but now my brother won\u2019t even speak to either of us and is being incredibly cold towards me I feel guilty as I care very much about my family but he has expressed he doesn\u2019t see me as family as much as his best friend and his girlfriend So am I the asshole here ?", "created_utc": 1667345203, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjovs1/aita_for_blocking_and_removing_my_brothers_best/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
