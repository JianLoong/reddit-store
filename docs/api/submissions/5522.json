But most people including me would get angry. So for dad, getting drunk is more important than having your son there. Unbelievable.  NTA", "NTA not even a close call.", "NTA. So you even questioning this is a sign your parents have always treated their wants and feelings over yours and made you feel bad anytime you wanted to do something different. You are setting a boundary and should feel good about yourself for being able to do so. Keep setting those boundaries and understanding how their behavior had affected you. Keep up with therapy and good luck!", "Noooooo! NTA, it\u2019s unsafe for you to drive!!! Period, end of the whole story. Your parents sound like entitled children. If they want their presents then obviously someone has to drive you to their house. Sounds like they are difficult to deal with. I\u2019d send their presents by mail (or better regift them to people who aren\u2019t assholes) and make different plans next year!!", "Took me a very long time to stand up to my parents .You are having problems ,they should understand. Stand your ground say as you aren't feeling well and uninsured (rem that as if you have an accident ur responsible)you won't be there end of.", "Wow, what greedy, self centered people. They were more concerned about what they\u2019d get out of it and how drunk they could get than to spend time with you (especially after an injury that sounds relatively seriously).\n\nYour response was totally appropriate. \n\nIf you\u2019re feeling petty, Return the gifts- they clearly don\u2019t deserve them. \n\nI hope you\u2019re able to still enjoy a nice, quiet Christmas as home. Speedy recovery! \n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nIt sounds like you may have a concussion. They can be pretty unpredictable. Don't put yourself at risk for ungrateful people - no matter who they are.", "Wtf. If it were my kid I would collect and drop off. Your parents are selfish. Don't feel bad. It's not your fault, it's theirs.", "NTA, unless you attempt to drive over there.  Not only because they're really awful and there's no reason you should have anything to do with them, let alone bring them presents, but because it's unsafe and you'd be risking your life and the lives of other motorists.\n\nConsider going NC.  I suspect you'll be much better off with a warm circle of friends who become your family of choice, and not with these greedy poor excuses for parents.  I hereby revoke their parent card.", "NTA, I suspect narcissism being so selfish and lacking empathy for you", "They meant to make you feel guilty. Don't buy into the manipulation. NTA", "Bingo", "....or their safety.", "There's nothing to be concerned about, OP is definitely joking there.", "What OP said wasn\u2019t a blow up in proportion to what their parents said to them. \n\nWhat the actual eff?! Alcohol and materialistic goods are more important than a living breathing human being?!\n\nOP, if you can try to take some no contact time from your parents, or at least as little as you can for a while. You and your physical and mental well-being matter. And you deserve to be around people who see that without you having to say or do anything.", "Is there a way to say that part that rhymes?", "I know a few people like this, they have such tunnel vision they can\u2019t adapt to change and instead of processing and thinking, they just say out loud their first processing step. Plus! They don\u2019t listen (and probably talk over one another), they didn\u2019t hear the bit about you not being able to get there and why. They just heard the effect on them. \nYou are justified in staying home and recovering and seeing them later on. You are allowed to love them as they are, we are not all the same, I\u2019m not sure people can develop emotional depth after a certain point in their life. I\u2019m sure they are capable of kindness and care.", "If dad's not imbibin', the holiday's not jivin'", "If dad can't have booze, then you're being his scrooge.", "They gave birth them him, that\u2019s the greatest present of all \ud83d\ude44", "Aww thank you!!", "Hahahaha, me neither!", "Oh I meant a way that rhymes with the presents / presence part lol", "see other reply lol", "for real!", "NTA sounds like you dodged a bullet. Rather than being concerned about you after your energy, they\u2019re more concerned with drinking and getting presents. They should be grateful to you for practically raising your brother. Their priorities are really backwards. I\u2019d rather spend it alone than with people who don\u2019t prioritize being with their children.", "Definitely NTA!", "They\u2019re literally huge assholes, you can\u2019t seriously possibly think you\u2019re wrong here", "NTA, but your folks sure are.\n\nI lived an hour from my folks when my car got totaled, and my dad was more than happy to come get me so I could visit when it wasn't even a holiday.", "NTA. My mom and aunt are making dinner tomorrow, I usually use Zipcar but none were available. So instead of me not being there, my dad is picking me up and dropping me off (about 20 min each way.)\n\nThey want to see you, someone can get you. They're TA, not you.", "NTA In my family we would have this exact conversation dead pan because everyone is joking. I have a feeling that your family was not joking. I wish you a Merry solo Christmas \ud83c\udf85", "Nta- don\u2019t go\u2026", "OP, this is awful. I am so sorry. NTA. I hope you heal quickly!", "NTA.  Is your mother a child?  The correct response would have been to wait until another time.  Tell your mother to grow up!  Tell your father are booze more important than you?", "Your dad seriously cares more about drinking than he does about seeing his own kid??? NTA", "NTA. If that's your dad's excuse, they clearly don't value your presence.", "This is so shitty of them. I\u2019m sorry. NTA", "NTA. Don't ever doubt yourself regarding these people.", "NTA - I'm sorry you hit the bad luck lottery in the parents department.  They don't care about you, only about their booze and what presents you got them.\n\nI'd be skipping holidays with them if that's how they treat you.", "Can't even be bothered to offer to help cover cab fare.", "Ohhhh me too. Pretty much all of them tbh. But I\u2019m gay in a Mormon family with my only non Mormon relatives being class B personalities", "NTA. Not even CLOSE to TA \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA.  Clearly they are still neglectful of your well-being.", "Wow...\nOp, you sure you want any contact with these people at all? Their colors really show. \n\nObviously NTA.", "NTA at all\n\nTake care of yourself.  Get a nice meal delivered.  Take a hot bath.  Listen to some good music.  Watch a good movie.  Talk to some friends.  Mute your family for a few days and just enjoy some peace and quiet.", "Wow. NTA, that\u2019s so rude and selfish of them", "NTA\n\nThey're more concerned with presents and being able to drink then your safety. WTAF \n\nPersonally I'd return their presents and get yourself something nice with the money", "NTA you know where their priorities lie. Damn, they are cold", "#NTA. Let that guilt go. Your parents don\u2019t care about you, OP, just what you give them.", " NTA sounds like you need to go LC, spend your time with friends instead of money grabbing, non caring family. Hope things get better for you.", "Yep, I identified both points and thought the same. SOD EM!", "Oops - thanks, fixed", "Her* but yeah.", "NTA \n\nOP if none of your relatives are willing to come get you then stay home!  \n\nNot fun I know but better safe at home and deliver presents later when you are healed than crashed in a ditch. \n\nAlso not sure what country you are in but in the US the insurance companies will check for things like existing work treatment. If they find you were ordered not to drive they would very likely use that as a reason to pay nothing for a claim.", "Jesus Christ. Nta. If I was in the same situation my mum would be like \"what about the presents we got for you?\". OP that is what a living patent would say. You should consider low or no contact.", "NTA Your parents chose alcohol over you and are more concerned about their presents then spending time with you.", "NTA, have a calm healing/relaxing day at home.", "I'm a mother myself and I couldn't even imagine in my wildest day dreams putting presents over my child's life and safety.\n\n\n\nI'd rather have no presents and my child safe and happy than anything else in the world. NTA and I'm sorry your parents are so shitty. Please know my family and I are sending you all of the Christmas blessings and happiness in the new year!", "NTA. Stay home, open a good bottle of wine, have some cheese and crackers, a few cookies, and forget these selfish people exist. Do it this year and every year here after.", "OP, you asked for a favor and were met with:\n\n>\"How am I meant to drink then?!\" / \"What about the presents you got for us?!\" \n\nGift yourself a holiday free of either selfish person because if they cared, they'd have accommodated you.\n\nPS - block them and any of their flying monkeys for the day (or longer).\n\nHappy Holidays!", "Ummmm, I am worried that you can\u2019t see that you are NTA.  I hope this puts things into perspective you are unable to drive because you are unwell, your parents are more concerned about presents and drinking than of your well being.    Please please re read what you just wrote, say it out load, than say to yourself if it was the other way around what would you do.", "Your parents care more about getting presents than your safety and well-being. You greedy, selfish parents are the assholes. NTA", "Wow, that sucks.  Is it possible that when you are feeling better you can return their gifts?  And buy a $1.99 bottle of champagne for your Dad and $1.99 bottle of perfume from a discount store/op shop/ 2nd hand shop - you get the idea.\n\nEven if you are not close, would it have been impossible for your Dad to collect you and an overnight bag, and take you home the next day when he's had a chance to sleep off the alcohol?\n\nIs there no one in the family who could help out?  Then you're not missing much if you don't go.  NTA - don't let their shitty attitudes put you in the wrong, step aside from the guilt, you don't need it.  Self care and self respect will be better for you than a day in their company.", "Definitely NTA. like do they even care about you", "What an AWESOME response", "Hey, me either. I have family, but I'm not invited due to being inconvenient. Tomorrow I'm getting drunk and watching my favourite Christmas movies, then pigging out of chicken and posh stuffing.", "This is actually true. Family time is much more tolerable with some libations.", "Oh, that\u2019s rough. The stuff I\u2019ve heard about people who have left the church are treated and add gay on top of that."]}
