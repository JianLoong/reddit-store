You can't drive because of a medical condition and all your parents care about is their presents and if Dad can drink. Wow. Don't feel bad about flipping on them, OP. They deserve it.

This post makes me want to scream. They\u2019re much more worried about day drinking than seeing you on the holiday, and are much more worried about their gifts.
