Cool, not really bothered. He then shows me a screenshot of his group chat with his friends joking that the girls baby \u2018has been through more d*ck than lana roades\u2019 and that \u2018The baby will have an IQ of 15 and have Vilma as it\u2019s godmother\u201d (I don\u2019t understand the last reference lol)\n\nI was quite shocked by this. I\u2019ve not known my bf to talk about anyone this way and I thought he was better than that gross misogynist talk. I was nosy and looked up the girl and it looks like she\u2019s been in a relationship for the past couple years so I don\u2019t even really understand what they\u2019re on about.\n\nMy reply was \u201cwhy are you so concerned about a girl you knew five years ago? You all sound gross and sad. Worry about yourselves\u201d\n\nHe got defensive and that it was just \u201ca joke\u201d I just said that it\u2019s not funny and idk why he thought I would find it funny either. Like I said, it\u2019s really not that scandalous to have a kid with someone you\u2019ve been with for years and it\u2019s nobody\u2019s business either way. He\u2019s now getting arsey and not replying. AITA?\n\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ve sent this\n\nLook, I\u2019m not going to be with someone who talks like this. It is tragic you\u2019re all so invested in this girls business. This sounds like a group of 14 year olds which is embarrassing and disappointing for me tbh. I\u2019m not telling you how to live or talk but I am just not compatible with someone like that. It\u2019s pathetic and misogynistic, and it concerns me that you\u2019re so okay with it you showed me the messages? If you can talk like that about her I don\u2019t even want to know what you\u2019ve said about me.", "created_utc": 1673039328, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1055l2t/aita_for_calling_my_bf_and_his_friends_gross_and/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let that sit for a bit. Do you want to be with someone like that?", "NTA.\n\nSometimes people don't realize they're doing an uncool thing until someone points it out for them. It may embarrass him, but that doesn't make it any less true. He needed a wake up call.", "NTA. He\u2019s mad he was called out for being an AH.", "NTA, this is a red flag, OP, he's not just standing by for this kind of misogynistic talk, but an active defendant of it. Run, don't walk.", "You\u2019re NTA. \u201cIt\u2019s just a joke\u201d is a refrain commonly heard from offensive and gross people. \n\nTime for a serious chat between the two of you. Your BF can be whatever way he wants to be. But you can choose whether you want to be with someone like that.", "NTA, and this is one of those cases that makes me thing 'huh, maybe other men *actually do* talk like that'", "NTA but consider this:\nYour boyfriend is such a complete sexist person and all of his friends are that they not only thought it was totally OK to make those jokes but it is so normalized to him that he thought it would be ok to share with you, and you wouldn't have a problem with it. This speaks to a total lack of character that is fundamental to who he is and that would take a lot of work and time to undo. You should be bothered by this not just because of the single incident but for what it says about him as a person.", "NTA that is both gross and childish which one of them never got to fuck her in uni and never got over it?", "NTA time to play. Sorry, I don't get the joke. Explain to me how it's funny? And stare at him as he digs himself a hole", "Nta. That is super gross talk. They seem sad that she didn't sleep with them or something. \n\nLet me just say when people tell/show you who they really are believe them.  If they talked like this about a girl they knew five years ago what do they say about women they currently know", "NTA. You found them very unpleasant comments (they certainly are imo) and you let him know your opinion. And it\u2019s not that you offended them by calling them names, as you said how they sound and that they should worry about themselves more\u2026 I think he is now pretending to be offended because it hurts his pride to have seen himself in front of the mirror.", "Why wasn't this a break-up conversation? Are you going to train him?", "I suppose you could have said it better, but OP is NTA. Why would he think that you would find the kind of thing funny? Maybe he doesn't see that he is being gross, but it's good to be called out on it. \n\nIt wouldn't be a bad idea to have a conversation with him down the line about it though. Once he's cooled down you can just explain it to him. You'd be surprised the kinds of things other people may not realize. \"When you showed me that, it made me wonder how you talk about me to your friends. She's been in a relationship for a long time and now she's pregnant... so yeah, it did seem gross when you showed me those things. Why did you think I would laugh?\"", "Well first off, you're NTA.\n\nYour boyfriend is just being immature with his friends. Yes, shitty behaviour and an even more shitty thing to say about someone - especially if their in a committed relationship and preparing for a child.\n\nI'd leave this one alone and let it pass, don't overthink it OP.. he'll come around.", "NTA grateful he outed himself to be a gross troll, pls update with a breakup story bc he doesn\u2019t respect her and won\u2019t respect you :(", "NTA but he and his friends are. It's a good thing he's not replying. It saved you the trouble of blocking the jerk.", "NTA - This is like asking some guy why a girls photo is \"asking for it\" and you asking him to explain. You called him out on his crap and he doesnt know how to respond other than back-peddling. Good for you on calling him out.", "He does sound gross and sad. Unless he sheds this friend group, he\u2019ll likely remain in this mindset. The odds of them all growing up and changing are slim since they all validate each other with this misogynistic crap. NTA", "NTA. They are gross. If they're willing to say that about her, they're almost certainly saying gross stuff about you too", "Neither of you are A-holes. Your reply was warranted. Sounds like casual dude talk in the GC, though I\u2019m not sure why he showed you thinking it\u2019s funny it\u2019s only really funny to the boys.", "NTA\n\nIt is gross. And remember, who he is with his friends is who he really is. You need to decide if you want to associate with people like that.", "NTA.  Your ex boyfriend, right?  You broke up with him due to his disgusting mindset towards women, yes?", "Y\u2019all can\u2019t seriously be telling them to break up over messages in a group chat. I guarantee this guy or his friends have never talked bad about ANY girl any of them are affiliated with. Guys don\u2019t talk about their girlfriends or girl friends like that. \n\nThis girl is completely unaffiliated to them so it\u2019s just jokes it\u2019s really not worth dumping him over it and claiming he\u2019s misogynistic especially if he\u2019s never showed that behaviour before. I\u2019m sorry but y\u2019all sound like you\u2019ve never been in a relationship and it shows\u2026breaking up with him over THIS is crazy especially if everything up until this point has been fine\u2026", "NAH. It's good that you're sensitive to her, (and others). But, if he doesn't actually treat women like this, then take it in the context intended- a joke. A tasteless joke, but still a joke. It's ok if you don't share his sense of humor but it was a conversation that didn't involve you.\n\nAlso, (not that you asked), stay out of his phone.", "ESH - I can only guess you mistyped \"13,\" because by 23 you should know groups of friends commonly have fun by taking shit at someone else's expense.  Does it make them not asshole? No it doesn't.   Does the high horse act somehow convince anyone that you and your friends haven't done the same?  No it doesn't.  Welcome to life.", "Well, I guess I'd put it this way.  Can you HONESTLY say you've never shit talked someone based on choices they have made.  Maybe made some off color jokes among friends?  If you can say that, you are a rare person, because most people do that to an extent.  Maybe its not as vulgar, but its still shit talking.  \n\nI guess NTA.  But I'm betting if he looked through some of your group chats, there would be some stuff that doesn't make you and your friends look great, and you'd probably not like him calling your friends \"gross and sad\". \n\nAlso, he is stupid for showing you that anyway.   Doing that makes no sense.", "Turn the tables around and tell him you were joking and ask why is he upset about that as you are only doing what they have done\u2026if he can be upset with your comments then why would he think that it is ok for them to make comments with no reaction from anyone!! Tell him to grow up and be a real man and stand up for what is right to his friends instead of following their stupid ways\u2026I hope he and his friends realise their actions show their true personality \u2026. That action of saying what they said truly shows what they think about women\u2026 I\u2019d be ashamed of them if they were related to me in any way\u2026like you said \u2026they are just gross and sad immature boys that need to grow up!!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A joke is funny not making fun of people. Yeah it could be a funny haha joke but it's doubtful. Chances are this is how he treats women and is just waiting for OP to be in to deep to leave.
