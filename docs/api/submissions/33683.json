My dad has never been present in a way that I only see him as my father biologically. I have no emotional connection to him. For a bit of background my dad was never there when I got awards or any big event in my life unless he was forced along, otherwise he just cancels on us, we basically grew up without him. My biggest problem is that it affects my siblings, about a few months ago we went and to go see a movie. None of us were really interested in it except for my little brother, but we all went with him because he was excited to see it. Dad had promised to see the movie with us, our dad never comes to the movie so that got my little brothers hopes up.\nLong story short he cancelled on us. My little brother began crying and hugged me, he then asked why dad didn\u2019t love him enough and what he could do to fix it. He was 10, my heart shattered hearing him say that. Or how he threatened to off himself constantly. There\u2019s a lot more I could go into but that would make this too long. \nOnto the actual event. Dad had come in while me and my younger sister were doing the dishes. Apparently he asked what we were doing, like it wasn\u2019t already obvious. We didn\u2019t answer because we both had music in our ears and we were jamming out. My dad ripped my sisters earphones out and told her to \u201ctake the fucking things out of her ears.\u201d My sister is very big on if you don\u2019t respect her, then she wont respect you. So she yelled back at him for him to give her earphones back. I can\u2019t stand being yelled at or people yelling at others, so I tried to defuse the situation and tell my sister to not worry about it and I have spares in my room.\nHe then got all in my face. He\u2019s very very loud. I started crying in response to this and it only caused him to get angrier and scream at me \u201cwhat did I do to make my kids hate me so much.\u201d Suddenly I just felt so angry at him, all these years of raising my siblings and him acting like he was such a great dad like he did \u201cso much\u201d for us just came back. I screamed at him that if he wanted the truth I\u2019d give it to him. I told him that he wasn\u2019t a great dad at all. He was never there when we needed him. The only time we got with him was a pathetic \u201cbye dad\u201d every morning before we left for school. How he told us that we ruined his life and that we are such \u201ctroubling\u201d kids to deal with and how we are so lazy and the names he called us when he was angry for no reason. \nI went on this big rant for 15 minutes, screaming at him to shut up every time he tried to interrupt. I only stopped when my mum ran through the front door after hearing me yelling and screaming at him. Dad then stormed out and I just became an exhausted, crying heap on the floor. Once I was calmer my mum said that even though my dad definitely deserved that, that I was a bit of an asshole about it and now I just wonder if I went too far.

He asked for answers and he got them. Of course, it was supposed to be rhetorical, since he doesn't believe he ever does anything wrong. Given the stupid question \"what are you doing?\" when the answer was obvious, and ripping the earphones out, it should be self-obvious why he's not a great dad, but that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nNo, you didn't go too far. He walked out even before you got to the bottom of the long list of why he's a failure as a dad. Odds are he'll ignore all of it, but maybe, just maybe, something actually penetrated. Your mother has things to answer for, too, since she's his enabler.", "NTA. He deserved that. Good on you for standing up to him.\nHe asked. You answered.\n\nBut INFO: Is he cancelling on you guys constantly due to work?\n\nEdit: saw answer in another comment. Your dad sucks.", "To have a dad present in the house but not a father is really troubling and can cause the same effect of not having one at all. You and your siblings are feeling emotionally abandoned and that can still lead to trauma. Yes, the situation could have been different with a conversation but I feel as if the way it was presented might stick with him and make him think. On the other hand he could just block it out and label you as disrespectful. I hope he took what you said in consideration and you are very strong for taking care and comforting your siblings. Also I think it would be a good idea for some family therapy or individual therapy for all siblings.", "This all depends on why he\u2019s never there (but doesn\u2019t change the fact that he\u2019s always cancelling). My friend is an on call doctor, and making plans was doomed to failure, it was spur of moment or nothing (for most part), we don\u2019t blame him, but we grew apart none the less. Nta for laying shit out, but withholding full judgement depending on his reasons for being absent", "INFO - How does your mom respond to his behavior? Has she given excuses for him over the years? Does he show up for her as a husband? Did his behavior change as you grew up or was it always like this? Does he act like giving food, money, etc is a favor and not a parental responsibility \n\nI'm gonna call NTA on this one. Unfortunately the explosion had been meaning to come for a long time, but neither of you will ever forget these things said, just like you can't forget how he's acted all these years.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
