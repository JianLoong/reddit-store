Literally every single woman I know has \u201cperiod\u201d underwear for this exact reason.\n\nYou sound like the type of guy to say that we shouldn\u2019t teach about periods in elementary schools because the kids are too young for it.

It\u2019s normal to have period stained underwear when blood flows out of your body. The only acceptable responses are a) should I buy you more underwear? And b) would you like to discuss this with a doctor if your flow is super heavy? That might be a medical problem that needs treating. Instead you treat her like she\u2019s incompetent and dirty. I don\u2019t think I can say how disgusted I am by the way you treated your poor daughter without getting banned.", "YTA\n\nLeaks and spotting happens. And unlike poop, you can't anticipate when it's going to happen. There's a reason your wife took your daughter's side on this one.", "YTA\n\nLet me know when you find a period product that is 100% leak proof. Because in my 10 years of menstruating, I haven\u2019t had a single period where I didn\u2019t leak at all.", "YTA and this is why the term mansplaining came to be. Go talk to a public health nurse. \n\nAlso.....  I helped a friend fold her laundry while we had a visit this weekend. I was able to fold underwear without examining the crotch how the fuck you fold?", "YTA.\n\nI never knew a women that didn't have \"period underwear\" because yeah, period leaks can happen, not matter what product you use. \n\nComparing it with shit stain proves you have really no idea what you are talking about.

If you really are concerned, how about having her consult with a gynecologist instead of treating your daughter like trash? Congratulations on alienating your daughter, fool.", "YTA. Period stains are just blood stains, they are not inherently unhygienic on underwear, especially since she obviously gets her underwear washed because you were folding them for her. Period staining is just a visual mark, it's not actually an indication of how well the person is keeping up with personal hygiene or an indication of an underlying health issue. If you're just concerned about your daughter having stained underwear, I would ask her if she needs more underwear so that she can have \"period undies\" that are already stained and regular undies for when she's not on her period. But ultimately, just listen to the people who have been socialized to deal with periods and probably know more about it than you do.\n\nAlso OP, just in case you also wonder, stains or unexpected coloration in general aren't uncommon for women's underwear, discharge can discolor underwear fabric, especially if they're dark.", "YTA.

You need an education and manners. \n\nPeriods are not like feces. \n\nPeriods are not controlled, they are managed. That means dealing with stains. Unless you change 'product' every hour, which is ridiculous and wasteful, there will be stains. Add in overnight, when even the best product can fail and you know, you are sleeping. Even people who know exactly when their period is going to start can be surprised or leak. The absolute only thing that prevents stained underwear are either meds to prevent periods, pregnancy or wearing a product all the time (again, not reasonable and not safe).\n\nAfter you apologize, offer to buy her panties just for that time of the month, or some of the washable period panties.

And yes YTA!", "Ugh you again.", "YTA. It can be difficult for girls to figure out which products work best for them, how often to change products, etc. It is definitely normal to get stains on your underwear before figuring this out\u2026and sometimes even after. No girl wants to bleed through her underwear, in fact it\u2019s most young girl\u2019s worst nightmare, so she is absolutely not doing this on purpose. And comparing period blood to not wiping well after you poop? The two are not the same and I\u2019m not sure periods work how you think they do.", "YTA. Wow. Don't compare period blood to poop. Most can control when poop comes out, period blood has a mind of its own and it goes where it pleases.

I got the ick from reading your post. \n\nIn 42 years of menstruating, I had a very difficult time finding feminine products that prevented leaks. Blood is hard to remove from cloth. In fact, many women have several pairs of 'period panties' that are ruined from staining, that they only wear during their period.\n\nLet your wife handle matters like this, because you clearly have no idea how women's bodies work, which is interesting because you have a wife and daughter.\n\nYTA", "YTA let your wife handling things like this.

I use tampons and pads and still get stains sometimes. So I have specific underwear I wear during periods.\n\nComparing it to poop stains is just silly. There's a vast difference between leaking beyond your control (maybe it happens when you sleep) and not washing/wiping your arse after you poop.", "YTA, just wait til you find out she can't control bleeding in the shower, either! Take some damn basic biology lessons ffs, it's completely normal to stain tf out of your underwear. Most people who menstruate specifically keep stained junk underwear around for when they're on their period because they know stains are a fact of life. It's not unhygienic, either, the underwear are clean and the stains are there. It sounds completely normal and like she has it under control.

It can be unsafe wearing or using synthetic products in hopes of waiting for it to start. Feminine products just like everything else has experienced shrinkflation and are not as good as they used to be. Tampons are smaller and pads are skinnier and shorter leaving more room for stains.

If very common and natural stains bother you so much, maybe offer to buy some extra pairs for non period times and let the stained ones become permanent period panties. Ultimately, though, it's really none of your business that they're there. The thing is, it's more than a little creepy that you're looking so closely at your daughters panties.
