Our relationship has been great and we have been practically inseparable. My birthday was last week and I spent the day after my birthday, with my boyfriend.\n\nWe agreed to hang out and get some food. When I got in the car there was a wrapped box in the back seat, clearly a gift. I was super excited because I was not expecting anything. \n\nWhen I got in the car my boyfriend says \u201cMy mom said I had to get you a gift\u201d and eagerly gives me the box. I immediately got the ick and ask \u201cDid she also pick it out?\u201d. He responded \u201cyea, actually\u201d and my heart immediately sunk to my stomach. I told him I didn\u2019t want it and he immediately became confused and asked why. I explained that I was dating him, not his mom. I told him that his mom making him give me a gift, and picking it out, showed a lack of effort and made me feel like he didn\u2019t care. He snapped back that I didn\u2019t ask for anything and I said I agree and was not expecting anything. He said he would have picked it out but didn\u2019t know what to give me and I told him that I understood and wished he would have either communicated that with me/asked me what I wanted\u2026.or drawn inspiration from things I say I like (ballet, rock climbing, makeup, etc). He responded with \u201cYou don\u2019t even know what\u2019s in the box\u201d. I told him I knew whatever was in the box would be amazing, because his mother is a woman, who knows what women like. But it wasn\u2019t about the gift for me, it was about the effort. He called me ungrateful and I went back home. \n\nI don\u2019t know\u2026I wasn\u2019t expecting anything nor did he have to give me a gift. I just feel like if you want to give a gift, you should put effort into it. I also would have been fine not knowing that his mom picked it out. Announcing to your girlfriend that your mom not only forced you to get a gift, but also picked it out is just a turnoff.

My first though was- ok his mum picked out the gift, fine, men generally are bad gift givers. But why did he say it? Why would someone start the gift giving process with announcing that their mother told them to get a gift?

Maybe it's because this is still a new relationship, but I promise you, years down the line you will be grateful that she does so. I don't want to generalise, but I can imagine that her choices for makeup or ballet gear would make a lot more sense than what he would come up with if he went to buy something on his own.

My partner (a woman) of over a decade sucks at giving gifts. I literally have to give her a list of things I would like and she chooses one or more depending on the budget she has for the gift. When it's my birthday, my friends often contact my partner to have access to the list because they say I'm difficult to shop for. \n\nLike he said, you have no idea what's in the box. What if he told her lots of awesome stuff about you and she helped him pick something that she felt you would like based on the info he gave. What if it's an AMAZING gift?

Maybe it's because this is still a new relationship, but I promise you, years down the line you will be grateful that she does so\n\nYears down the line you absolutely won't be grateful. If years down the line your partner of years still doesn't care to think about what you might like, still can't be bother to take 10 minutes to try to desperately rack their brain as to what interests their partner has and what they might enjoy then you should be devasted.\n\nIf you and your partner talk often they should know what kind of books you like, what films, what author you like, you can buy a book from the genre or author they read, you can buy a new bottle of the expensive perfume they like that you can just check and see if it's almost empty. You can buy matching earrings or bracelet to some jewellery she loves.\n\nIt's not how good the gift is, it's the thought that counts. If the book is shit but they went to the effort of trying to get something that their partner could enjoy, that's what matters. Putting in zero effort implies they really don't know or care enough about their partners interests to be able to buy a gift.", "Agreed!

Hopefully the experience would have been positive, he would have learned that you liked gifts, and he would have done it on his own\u2026 next time.\n\nhow would it be a learning experience and he'd learn to get gifts on his own if OP 'has' to accept this gift because it's somehow rude not to? If OP accepts this, he's only learning that if he tells his mother to pick something out then OP will accept it and he doesn't have to do anything.\n\nThe only way he's learning to pick something out himself is by OP not accepting the gift because he didn't pick it out himself.\n\nBoyfriend buys partner a horse, it will cost 10k a year to stable and feed it, you don't have 10k, but it's a gift so of course you must accept it. Nah. If someone gets you something ridiculous (which could be a ridiculous gift that creates a burden for you, or it comes with strings attached, or is a symbol of how little they care for you like having someone else buy it), you have zero obligation to accept it.", "I would add that even a gift card would have been better than \"my mom made me...\" \n\nIf OP likes reading, getting a gift card for a bookstore, \"I wasn't sure if there was a specific book you would have liked. So I got a gift card, then maybe we could go book shopping as a date and coffee after on me?\" \nAt least that would have been some effort.", "Yeah that was tacky of him.", "I've gotten my gf things that have had my mom's opinion on it (from a women's point of view) but I never mentioned that lol", "He's 21 and inexperienced at life and did something thoughtless without thinking it through.", "Then set that expectation and communicate. If you could turn back time, wouldn't it have been better to have said, \"thank you for the gift. In the future, if you're having trouble picking something out for me, I can give you hints or you can share your budget and I can give you some ideas. I wouldn't want to waste your money and for you to be disappointed I didn't like it. Thank you and your mom so much for thinking of this gift (IF it's a good one). In the future, it's YOUR thought that counts and if it's too much pressure, I can help\". \n\nAlso, some people have anxiety gift giving and end up just taking their partner shopping to buy it together. Or maybe he doesn't actually believe in giving or receiving gifts. This was an opportunity to communicate and share what your expectations are.

Accepting the gift is not helping him to learn from his mistake in any way, not accepting it and explaining why is how someone would learn.", "I never compared it that way. \n\nHer reaction should be the same if a coworker, friend, niece, nephew, son, daughter gave her the gift. She chose to be a AH.", "Do you understand how gratitude works?", "Yes, you absolutely did compare it that way LOL. Don\u2019t try and gaslight me. You said she should ask herself \u201cHow would I react if my kid did this to me\u201d when her boyfriend does something dumb/incompetent. Either way I disagree with you. OP should expect more effort from her BOYFRIEND than her fucking nephew. Get real.", "Okay, do you understand how learning works and now context works? What does gratitude have to do with us talking about learning and how you teach him to be a better person or find a gift himself."]}
