My birthday was last week and I spent the day after my birthday, with my boyfriend.\n\nWe agreed to hang out and get some food. When I got in the car there was a wrapped box in the back seat, clearly a gift. I was super excited because I was not expecting anything. \n\nWhen I got in the car my boyfriend says \u201cMy mom said I had to get you a gift\u201d and eagerly gives me the box. I immediately got the ick and ask \u201cDid she also pick it out?\u201d. He responded \u201cyea, actually\u201d and my heart immediately sunk to my stomach. I told him I didn\u2019t want it and he immediately became confused and asked why. I explained that I was dating him, not his mom. I told him that his mom making him give me a gift, and picking it out, showed a lack of effort and made me feel like he didn\u2019t care. He snapped back that I didn\u2019t ask for anything and I said I agree and was not expecting anything. He said he would have picked it out but didn\u2019t know what to give me and I told him that I understood and wished he would have either communicated that with me/asked me what I wanted\u2026.or drawn inspiration from things I say I like (ballet, rock climbing, makeup, etc). He responded with \u201cYou don\u2019t even know what\u2019s in the box\u201d. I told him I knew whatever was in the box would be amazing, because his mother is a woman, who knows what women like. But it wasn\u2019t about the gift for me, it was about the effort. He called me ungrateful and I went back home. \n\nI don\u2019t know\u2026I wasn\u2019t expecting anything nor did he have to give me a gift. I just feel like if you want to give a gift, you should put effort into it. I also would have been fine not knowing that his mom picked it out.

If years down the line your partner of years still doesn't care to think about what you might like, still can't be bother to take 10 minutes to try to desperately rack their brain as to what interests their partner has and what they might enjoy then you should be devasted.\n\nIf you and your partner talk often they should know what kind of books you like, what films, what author you like, you can buy a book from the genre or author they read, you can buy a new bottle of the expensive perfume they like that you can just check and see if it's almost empty. You can buy matching earrings or bracelet to some jewellery she loves.\n\nIt's not how good the gift is, it's the thought that counts.

If OP accepts this, he's only learning that if he tells his mother to pick something out then OP will accept it and he doesn't have to do anything.\n\nThe only way he's learning to pick something out himself is by OP not accepting the gift because he didn't pick it out himself.\n\nBoyfriend buys partner a horse, it will cost 10k a year to stable and feed it, you don't have 10k, but it's a gift so of course you must accept it.

Whoosh. \n\nNTA. Throw this one back, he's too immature. In many ways, not too mention his petulant, resentful comment about how his mom made him get you a gift.
