Last night, around 1 am, my (21M) girlfriend (20F) was studying with a group of people at the library while I was home. I was about to go to sleep, had the lights off and was in bed when I got a call from her saying that she had no one to walk her back home. She did not directly say she wanted me to walk her back home, she was saying that she was feeling upset and stressed and that she was trying to figure out how to get back. If she did, I would've been more than happy to walk her back. I live 15-20 minutes away from the library so I suggested that she could Uber back home to save time. I did not realize that she wanted me to walk her back home. After she abruptly ended the call, I kept texting her and suggesting that I could walk her back if needed and she didn't say anything to me. I left her seven missed calls and she didn't pick up. Turns out she found her lab partner and walked back with him (they live in the same building). She's upset that I didn't immediately suggest me coming to our campus's library and walk her to her house which is another 15 minutes away from my house (It's like a triangle). Now she won't talk to me. Was I wrong in this situation? I genuinely don't know if I messed up or not. I thought it was unfair of her to expect me to do this without her explicitly stating this. \n\ntl;dr gf was at library and kept doing work with her group until 1 am, calls me at 1 am while i'm about to sleep and indirectly wants me to pick her up from the library without actually saying it, now she's mad at me and won't talk to me", "created_utc": 1683229855, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/137xw5p/aita_for_not_walking_my_21m_girlfriend_20f_in_the/", "score": 311, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's unreasonable for her to expect you to jump out of bed in the middle of the night for no compelling reason. If what she really wanted was for you to walk with her, she should have said so.  I don't believe in blaming people for not being able to read your mind.  That sounds like she was gaslighting you.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to learn to say what she wants. Yes, reading between the lines, she wanted you to walk her home, but it\u2018s not hard to say the words \u201aCould you please pick me up and walk me home?\u2018 to your partner. \n\nHer reaction to your suggestion was uncalled for and if she hadn\u2018t been offended and ignored you, the two of you would probably have found a solution - And maybe even done what she wanted. \n\nStill, she needs to prepare better (plan to walk with study friends, plan to take an Uber, etc) or be able to find solutions herself because people may be asleep at 1am and not respond to her call. \n\nIt sounds like she wanted to act helpless and incompetent and wanted /you/ to walk her home instead join the lab partner whom she magically found just a moment after she ended the call.", "You did nothing wrong. She should have planned how to get home safely when she realized she\u2019d be out late.  Or she could have called you and said, \u201cI messed up and didn\u2019t plan how to get home, will you help me?\u201d. (If she is at a college, many offer escorts from the library late at night.) She behaved childishly when you offered to help but it wasn\u2019t good enough, then when she got help elsewhere and she punished you by not letting you know.  You folks need an open conversation about this dynamic.", "NTA. She should have said something", "NTA. It's kinda dumb to expect someone to just get out of their house at a time like 1 am to simply walk you for 15 min. It's not safe and illogical, her ghosting you doesn't help her also and further more it is just unfair to think some would just risk themselves for something and she didn't even ask.", "NTA. I feel like I'll possibly be downvoted by some people - maybe cause I live in a super safe enviroment while also being a woman who travelled all over the world on her own. But I don't think that a man needs to chaperone his gf in the middle of the night from a place that's 20 Minutes away and without any previous inquiry or communication. What does that mindset say? That being single is dangerous? That you need a man in your life to move freely? Hell no.\n\nYou were offering solutions. She was playing games with you and that's a huge red flag.", "NTA, my god. She\u2019s a grown ass woman. You didn\u2019t make her stay out till 1am without a plan for how she\u2019d get home. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d even be the ass if she asked you to walk her and she flat out refused. Doesn\u2019t your university have those \u2018safe ride\u2019 vans for these situations, in addition to Uber being an obvious option? You\u2019re not obligated to go spend over an hour walking around late at night because your girlfriend can\u2019t make a plan.", "NTA:  First offering the Uber is the smartest plan. Uber will probably take 5 min to pick her up, compared to her standing outside at 1 am waiting for you to walk to her. \n\nBut she doesn't want an Uber that's fine, she should use her words and not just hang up.  Than you even offered to walk her and she ignored you.", "NTA- you were a bit clueless but that doesn\u2019t make you a bad person, and you tried to do the right thing. I\u2019ll be honest it was inconsiderate of her to not let you know she wanted you to walk her home hours before hand. It\u2019s 1:00 am during exam week. Waking her home would get you home around 2. that\u2019s a big ask when it\u2019s thrust on you last minute, especially when she never actually asked.", "NTA. It would have made more sense to call an uber, that's the great thing about that service! A device in your pocket at all times where you can just tap some buttons and a ride shows up to take you home safely. But he had to climb out of bed at 1 am to walk her back?", "NTA - She needs to communicate what she wants/needs. Not everyone\u2019s brains pick up on implied meanings. Some people needs things to be said explicitly, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. You were also winding down for bed, so you weren\u2019t in the sharpest headspace.\n\nYou offered safe ways for her to travel and then texted her with the solution to walk her back. She shouldn\u2019t be mad at you for not being a mind-reader or for not suggesting exactly what she wanted exactly when she wanted you to. She could\u2019ve easily said, \u201cCan you walk with me?\u201d She didn\u2019t, and that\u2019s on her.\n\nI\u2019d also say it\u2019s on her for not planning better on how she will get home so late. She should\u2019ve asked you beforehand if you\u2019d accompany her back or made arrangements to get home when it got dark. It\u2019s kind of unreasonable to expect you to come out in the middle of the night for a preventable non-emergency.", "NTA.  You aren't a mind reader.  Grown women use words.", "NTA. She never asked. You suggested a solution, she didn\u2019t like it. You later texted her offering to walk her home.\n\nYou aren\u2019t a mind reader. People need to communicate clearly with their partner\u2019s and be direct about what they want/need. Her attitude is extremely childish.", "NTA you\u2019re not a mind reader, nor were you at the library with her. If she had wanted you to walk her back she should have out right asked you. She also should have kept an eye on the time since she knew she\u2019d be walking home alone. I\u2019d say that was poor judgment on her part. I would also question whether you want to be in a relationship with someone who ghosts you because you haven\u2019t done something you haven\u2019t been asked you to do.", "NTA. Look I was a young woman at a college out of state with few to no friends to call on for a walk back to my apartment. You know what I did? I called someone back home and made the walk with them on the phone, telling them when I was crossing a street by name or a landmark that local cops would know if something happened. I did this so if someone leaped out of the darkness, my family at least had a starting point for local police. I could understand being leery of Uber in the middle of the night. I can also understand asking someone to walk with me or calling someone. But if she doesn\u2019t ask, how could you read her mind?", "NTA. Sounds like the kind of BS some young women do, where they expect you to know what they want without them actually asking for it. Proper communication is the mark of a mature person in any relationship. I'm not talking about emotional labor, where a person has to remind their spouse to wash the dishes that they can see need to be done in the sink. But she could have just wanted to vent, she might have wanted you to stay on the phone to talk to her while she walks, there were multiple options she could have been looking for. It's not hard to say \"hey, it's late and I'm nervous walking home alone, will you come walk me home?\"", "NTA \n\nThat time of night, I can understand not wanting to walk alone. Especially a young female. But part of being a young female is knowing not only how to recognise the danger, but also how to eliminate/minimise it. Which is 1) having a plan A (ie before staying out that late, make a plan with someone who is willing to be you\u2019re buddy and walk you home) and 2) having a plan B incase plan A falls thru - which in this could\u2019ve been calling you, and ASKING you to come and get her. \n\nUber would\u2019ve been an option but also not always the safest option for a young single female in the middle of the night.", "NTA. Whenever I was walking to my car after dart, I\u2019d call my boyfriend and just chat with him the whole way and he didn\u2019t mind. Granted I never walked for more then 10 minutes but that\u2019s an option as well that either of you could\u2019ve suggested.", "NTA - I might have a different answer if she had asked you outright. I always had a male friend or group of girls to walk with at night, otherwise, I'd hop on the phone call with someone. If she wanted you to walk her home, she probably could have communicated that better. You did suggest an Uber, and then immediately after noted you could indeed walk her home. The fact she didn't pick up the phone, and basically did not respond to any of your messages makes her the AH. Even if I was beyond pissed at my bf I would let him know I got home safe.", "So, she didn\u2019t communicate and you failed to guess so she punished you by not communicating even more.  I can see where this is going.  NTA", "She called late at night.  If she had asked directly, you should have gone.  But she didn't.  You suggested an alternative and then you texted and called trying to offer what she couldn't figure out how to ask for.  I think the rest is on her.  She needs to figure out how to come out and express her wishes - that's difficulty is on her.  \n\n\nGL and NTA.", "NTA. You\u2019re too far away for you to be. They usually have a station and a call button at most campuses that you can use to get a security guard to walk you back if you live on campus", "NTA - You offered a safe option, you live 20 minutes away, it was already 1:00 AM, and her response to your \u201cfailure\u201d to immediately volunteer to come walk her was not reasonable.\n\nYou even offered to come walk her, it was the \u201cdidn't immediately offer\u201d that upset her.", "NTA --- but I would try not to become overly reliant on this \"well she didn't directly ask me\" thing. I will grant you, this is a situation where it might require a bit of a connecting two and two to figure it out, but many guys also go down the path of acting like something obvious wasn't asked of them when any reasonable person would have made the connection. Perhaps next time, a good approach when she calls/texts you and seems flustered, would be to ask \"is there something I can do to help?\"", "NTA  You aren't a mind reader.  This is on her.", "NTA. You're not a mind reader, even less so when half asleep. If she wanted something, girl should have used her damn words.", "NTA. That\u2019s unreasonable. Presumably you were tired already and weren\u2019t thinking that far into it. You aren\u2019t a mind reader\n\nEdit to add: also, her hanging up and then ignoring you is incredibly immature and can be a manipulation tactic. I\u2019m not going to jump out and scream abuse or anything. I\u2019m just saying, if it\u2019s a pattern, it\u2019s something to be aware of. Emotionally mature people would say \u201cI\u2019m home safe, I don\u2019t want you to worry, but I need some space\u201d or something like that", "NTA.\n\nI definitely think you should have suggested walking her back to be clear. Not everyone is going to ask you for help and in good relationships you (and her) should be offering help instead of sitting back and waiting to be asked. \n\nThe only reason I'm not calling you TA right off the bat is that it was 1am. And I don't know about you, but I'm not thinking super clearly at 1am. So in that situation, I do think she should have just been saying \"hey can you walk me home?\" instead of hoping that you were on the tip top of your gentleman game, which you clearly weren't.", "NTA from me. She's an adult, you aren't mind reader. If she wanted you to walk her, she should have say so. Silent treatment as \"punishment\" isn't scream maturity either...", "It\u2019s a close call, but I\u2019m going with NTA. Assuming you truly did not realize she wanted you to walk her home, I think you offered up a suitable solution with Uber. Ghosting you is immature, but she\u2019s not exactly TAH here, either. For women, walking home alone at night can be stressful, scary, and downright dangerous. She could\u2019ve done better by directly asking you, though. It does no good to expect your partner to read minds.", "NTA", "NTA she should have planned ahead.", "Nta I\u2019d just see how it plays out. Be gentle, kind, but not a doormat. Let her response tell you.", "100% NTA, you\u2019re both adults and can communicate your needs with each other, plus at 1am an Uber just makes more sense. I would\u2019ve been more inclined to say no aholes here if she didn\u2019t ignore your calls and texts afterwards", "NTA - unless you have some extraordinary mind-reading powers, she should have come right out and said she wanted you to come get her.", "She's an adult she can figure out a ride and she's an adult she can communicate her needs.", "NTA: It\u2019s 1 am with a non-emergency and your provided a safe alternative. She\u2019s pissed because you didn\u2019t drop everything for her demand to be walked. You\u2019re not being a bad bf. She had other options that wouldn\u2019t inconvenience you in the middle of the night.", "Uhhhh Im worried about the lab guy. He making moves on your girl!!!", "I'm going go with NTA, because maybe she should have been more direct in asking since you weren't near her. But...a little chivalry goes a long way.", "NTA. She's gaslighting you. You did zero wrong", "NAH. She didn\u2019t ask, and you would have helped her if she had. Ghosting you didn\u2019t help anything.", "So was she quite happy to stand and wait in one place for 15-20 minutes, instead of getting an uber?", "NTA.\n\nYour gf was trying to hint that she wanted you to come and walk her home, but when it went over your head she should've just opened her mouth and plainly asked you what she wanted. Plus the whole not talking to you now is immature.", "NTA. She expected you to read her mind. This is not possible even in the middle of the day when you're wide awake, doubly impossible in the middle of the night when you're half asleep. \n\nNow she's giving you the silent treatment for not reading her mind. Immature and abusive. Honestly, she doesn't sound great in this story.", "NTA\n\nYou were not even remotely wrong. Seems like maybe she should think about getting home before staying out till 1am and then expecting you to jump out of bed to fix her lack of preparation.", "How did your GF get all the way to college without being able to use her words??? NTA", "Nta you offered options", "Crap like this really makes me appreciate my husband more and more. I lived a 10/15 minute bike ride from campus. I worked the closing shift at the library. Even before we started cohabitating, he was there, at the end of every shift, waiting to follow me home to make sure I was safe. I never asked him for it. We live in a tiny, relatively safe town, but man did I feel loved, supported, and SAFE with him there. \n\nDon't worry OP, it looks like your future ex gf has a decent guy she can potentially consider once the novelty of you wears off.", "[deleted]", "I mean, you can hear what the (aggressively downvoted) women here are saying or you can feel justified. It really comes down to how you want to move forward with or without her.  \n\nWalking alone after dark is dangerous for women and girls. And yes, it\u2019s much more dangerous for us, and staying on the phone doesn\u2019t do much, as in the case of Sarah Everard and far too many others. \n\nFor a lot of women, how seriously you take that reality is an indication of how much trust we can place in you.\n\nShould she have \u2018planned better\u2019 as a lot of people are saying? Maybe. Does it matter? Can you maybe see from her perspective that part of the frustration is *having* to plan, because she lives in a world that isn\u2019t safe? It\u2019s an extra, maddening burden that we really would love to not have. And it sucks to have to ask someone to be a chaperone. Especially when you know it\u2019s an inconvenience. It\u2019s another reminder that she\u2019s not safe and that she - a grown-ass, smart, independent woman - needs a male presence by her side. It\u2019s infantilizing and makes us feel even more powerless. \n\nHaving a partner who understands that is really important to a lot of women; frankly, not understanding is a dealbreaker for most of the ladyfolk I know. \n\nI get that it\u2019s not an immediate impulse for you, but for her it probably signifies how much you care about her and her safety. \n\nEveryone here can chime in about how reasonable that is or isn\u2019t, but the bottom line is that you\u2019re with someone for whom it clearly matters a lot. If you want to stay with her, it\u2019s probably a good idea to read up on why. You don\u2019t have to and you don\u2019t have to take anyone\u2019s judgment about whether or not it makes you an AH.

Last night, around 1 am, my (21M) girlfriend (20F) was studying with a group of people at the library while I was home. I was about to go to sleep, had the lights off and was in bed when I got a call from her saying that she had no one to walk her back home. She did not directly say she wanted me to walk her back home, she was saying that she was feeling upset and stressed and that she was trying to figure out how to get back. If she did, I would've been more than happy to walk her back. I live 15-20 minutes away from the library so I suggested that she could Uber back home to save time. I did not realize that she wanted me to walk her back home. After she abruptly ended the call, I kept texting her and suggesting that I could walk her back if needed and she didn't say anything to me. I left her seven missed calls and she didn't pick up. Turns out she found her lab partner and walked back with him (they live in the same building). She's upset that I didn't immediately suggest me coming to our campus's library and walk her to her house which is another 15 minutes away from my house (It's like a triangle). Now she won't talk to me. Was I wrong in this situation? I genuinely don't know if I messed up or not. I thought it was unfair of her to expect me to do this without her explicitly stating this. \n\ntl;dr gf was at library and kept doing work with her group until 1 am, calls me at 1 am while i'm about to sleep and indirectly wants me to pick her up from the library without actually saying it, now she's mad at me and won't talk to me\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
