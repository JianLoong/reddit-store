We have been together since one year now. He has a high paying job and so do I. He purchased a house against a loan 2 years ago (before we met) and so he needs to pay off his mortgage. \n\nI live in an rented apartment by myself so finances are not an issue for me. The next step for us is to move in. His house is nicer and is in the central part of the city and my lease is ending in December this year. \n\nWe have been having arguments regarding some financial decisions. He wants me to pay \u201crent\u201d (half his mortgage) to move into his house. His reasoning is that it\u2019s no different than paying rent to a landlord for having a roof over my head. \n\nI countered him and told him something like this: \nFirst, you are using the term \u201crent\u201d to disguise the fact you want me to pay towards your mortgage, extorting me. It\u2019s YOU who builds assets and YOU who gains from this deal by having ONLY YOURSELF on the deed and not me, when I pay the exact amount as you through \u201crent\u201d. \n\nConsidering we date for long term (he and I don\u2019t want marriage) it\u2019s me who gains nothing from investing in this property in the event we break up. I was really fiery when I told him that this isn\u2019t a fair trade because we both are supposed to be partners and I made it VERY clear I would not pay rent UNLESS I am at least part owner of the house somehow. \n\nWhen he countered again with his subterfuge logic about landlord-tenant relationship, I said: \nIf we were both to rent a place TOGETHER and pay rent to a landlord, that would be different because it\u2019s not like one of us is getting a name on the deed and gaining any benefits. So it\u2019s fair and equitable. \n\nThis isn\u2019t me being greedy, this is me honouring my principles and ensuring I am not financially taken advantage of. \n\nEdit: Frankly, I knew someone who paid rent towards a house owned by someone they were in a relationship with, and they were screwed over financially. When they broke up, this person was left with nothing, while the home owner\u2019s property was more paid off than it was two years ago. I considered this financial abuse and I am not letting that happen to me. \n\nI am ready to take responsibility of comsumables such as bills and groceries (50-50) and I also offered to eventually, retroactively finance all the deposits (insurance, down payment etc) before he met me so I know I\u2019m not being a hypocrite. \n\nI am open to paying rent as long as we both stand as equals. \n\nHis face was red by now and he called me a stuck up bitch. I called him greedy and left. \n\nI think he is more upset about the fact that he does NOT get to subsidise his lifestyle through me if it\u2019s not benefitting both of us. And that\u2019s a principle I stand by. \n\n\nAITA?\n\n\nEDIT: JUST TO REITERATE IN CASE ANYONE MISSES THIS OUT, I have enough money to contribute towards half of all his deposits, and I offered to do so. If you don\u2019t catch this detail and demonise me for being a \u201cgold digger\u201d, I cannot take your opinion seriously.\n\n\n\n\nEDIT 2: I think some clarifications are needed desperately. \n\n1. I can LITERALLY write him a CHEQUE TOMORROW for HALF of the deposits, insurance, taxes etc. \n\n\n2. Please do not confuse partnership with landlord tenant relationship because: \n\na) I generally don\u2019t sleep with my landlords or pursue a romantic relationships with them. \n\nb) I don\u2019t offer to finance their down payments\n\n\n\nEdit: Anyone calling me versions of gold digger/freeloader/cake eater you guys are actual MORONS because YOU didn\u2019t bother reading the whole post, missing the KEY point about my offer to finance his down payments. \nGet it together y\u2019all!

After we get married I will make sure she is set up to inherit the house if we are still married and together when I die. My situation is considered normal.

It's a terrible, **terrible** idea for unmarried people to be joint owners on *anything* major, *especially* a house; you have none of the legal protections afforded to married couples who split property in a divorce so you'd need to hire attorneys and draft up a lot of contracts to specify what would happen if you separated. Without that, one partner could easily hold the other partner's equity hostage because neither of you would be able to sell the home without both agreeing, and when you did sell it, the proceeds would be divided 50/50 even if the money put in wasn't. That's one reason that same-sex marriages were so important to that community - marriage is essentially a shortcut around what would probably take thousands of pages of legal contacts to recreate.\n\nPlus, you can't be a joint owner on the property without refinancing the home into a new mortgage with both of your names on it, and given he got the home several years ago, that's going to be a massive loss in terms of interest rates - he likely has an incredibly good interest rate compared to what you could get today, so the new mortgage would be much higher.

This situation is different for everyone. When I owned a house and rented a room to a friend, I gave her a flat monthly rate that was significantly less than half of the mortgage + utilities + HOA + home improvements. She also never ever cleaned anything, so part of the flat rate was a cleaning fee as I did 100% of the upkeep and cleaning. That was the arrangement that worked for us. I sold her the house when I moved out of state, and as I had sunk so much more money into the house than I\u2019d gotten from her and she had cheap enough rent to save up, we did not count any of her rent towards purchase. We used my realtor as a facilitator which allowed me to sell it to her for a bit less because the fees were significantly lower. \n\nWhen my ex bought a house, I sunk a lot of money into it.
