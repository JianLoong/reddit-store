She did let me know about my biological parents when I was 5 or 6 and told me if I ever wanted to see them to let her know and she would contact them so when Father\u2019s Day rolled around I asked mom is I could meet him and she said yes and called him (no answer) left a message (no answer)now I was pretty sad. fast forward a few years I am now 8. Once again I ask my mom if I could meet him and she said yes. And so we go to his moms house. He wasn\u2019t there but my aunt was. After a little bit he showed up. We met. Me and mom left and me and him never talked again. Until I was like 11 he asked mom if I could come stay the weekend with him now this is where shit hits the fan. 1st day I want to leave because instead of hanging out with his daughter he barely even knows he goes in his room and gets on his Xbox with his wife! So that night I call my mom and tell her I want to come home but he lives out of state and it\u2019s like a 2 hour drive so the next day comes and I finally get to leave and I get asked by my aunt if I liked it at my dads and I said yeah (his name) is pretty cool and she stops. Looks at me . And says. (His name)? Don\u2019t you mean dad? And I say no? And she says that\u2019s your dad call him dad! And I refuse because he\u2019s never in my life! Well fast forward 2 years. I\u2019m 13 and he passes. And I make a post use his name and once again SHE GETS MAD. Now I am 15 and she still gets mad if I don\u2019t call him dad when he gets brought up. I 100% see where she is coming from yeah I came from his nuts but he completely abandoned me!

Ya anyone can make a kid, only people that raise you are your parents.", "NTA. He might have contributed sperm to your birth but he really isn't behaving like a father, you have every right to not call your sperm donor 'dad'", "NTA he may have been your father but he wasn\u2019t your dad.", "Nope, NTA. As a matter of fact, your bio aunt sounds like the real AH here. She should've mad your bio dad left you instead of insisting BS titles he didn't deserve.", "NTA.  Your bio parents walked away from you, which I cant imagine how that feels.  Second your bio parents needed to earn the \"title\" of being called Mom and Dad.  He was never there for you he abandoned you.  So he doesn't get to be called that title, even if he has passed.  At this point he is the sperm donor, that's all.  Your adoptive mom, she earnt the title of Mom, she was there for you when you scraped your knee, took you to school, helped with school work, full respect to her.\n\nYour aunt doesn't get to choose who you call Mom or Dad, and she is plainly in the wrong.", "NTA\nI don't understand where these people get this audacity. Never acted as a father, never tried to connect with you and try to redeem himself in your eyes. There's nothing wrong with what you did.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nHe was half of your biological template and not much more. Further, he had 13 years to create a  bond with you where you would want to call him \"Dad,\" but he chose not to. In fact, you should tell your aunt that he didn't want you to call him \"Dad\" because he didn't earn the title. She doesn't need to know that you never had such a conversation.  With any luck, saying that will get her to back off.", "NTA, for someone to be called dad they have to act like one. I grew up with my father but I still don\u2019t call him dad because he never acted or behaved like one.", "NAH. I see both points. He was not a dad to you, so NTA for using his name. I am sure his sister is still grieving his passing, so see where she might feel badly. You do you and don't worry about what anyone else says.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
