I asked where I could see it on YouTube once posted and he wouldn\u2019t tell me his handle. He claimed if I could respond it would give me clout, and he didn\u2019t want me having any clout on his back. \n\nThen I started filming him\u2026 just in case.\n\nEventually his girlfriend came out of the store, sat next to him, and started filming me. While we were talking on camera together he actually said again that I needed to pay him to delete the video. So now HE \u201cmessed up today\u201d.

Which is better for you, worse for him.", "NTA - whether you should have or shouldn't have left the kids in the car is irrelevant.  Nobody should be filming children. He wasn't doing it out of concern for your kids, we was doing it to exploit images of your kids.", "NTA Guy has no concern for kids' welfare. His only goal was to scam you.

He's an adult, so maybe post your video of him and see if you get any leads.", "You actually don't have any evidence that this guy is a YouTuber (or at least one with any sort of following) other than that he told you he was.

Let me explain: you referenced Kaitlyn's Law, which means wr can infer that you live in California. Within the confines of the United States you sacrifice all expectation of privacy when you enter into a public space. The pharmacy parking lot is a public space. So, right or wrong, he 100% had the legal right to film you and your children, regardless of how many times you tell him he isn't allowed to.", "ESH. Don\u2019t leave your kids unattended in the car. When he mentioned payment for not posting, he committed extortion, which is a fairly serious crime. If he had simply sent the video to CPS, that wouldn\u2019t have been illegal but requesting payment to not post is an entirely different issue. Don\u2019t pay. If he posts it, odds are hardly anyone will see it because almost no one will care. If he posts it, post your video of him with his user name trying to extort you and identify him.", "YTA. Just googled Kaitlyn\u2019s Law and it says \"the law makes it illegal for a child to be left unattended in a motor vehicle\". So, no, this wasn't legal at all. Him filming people out in public? Definitely legal.", "YTA......\n\n\nYou NEVER leave kids alone in the car....", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You don't leave seven year olds alone anywhere unless you want them to get hurt or lost or kidnapped.", "NTA...  It wasn't that hot and the kids are old enough to scream for help/ break a window.

There\u2019s an implied consent ruling that says if you see recording equipment and don\u2019t ask them to stop you are giving consent.
