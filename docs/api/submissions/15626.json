Size, color, stitching, just the texture of our wallets is slightly different. \n\nSo anyways, we were hanging with some friends and decided to call it a night. While I was grabbing my stuff to leave I grabbed his wallet by mistake, (I'd already thrown my own wallet in my gym bag I kept with a change of clothes because I go over straight after work.) I got all the way home without realizing. I live 20 minutes away and it was raining at 11 o clock at night. So I get a phone call maybe 5 minutes after I get home. \"Hey man do you have my wallet?\" Check my pocket and sure enough it's there. Tell him I 'm sorry I have it. \"Well I need you to drive it back to me.\"He doesn't know this, but I have to be at work at 8 in the morning and leave at 12 the next morning, but I didn't say this. I just ask him if I can bring it to him early tomorrow. I know I messed up. \"No bud you messed up. I work early in the morning and I want to go out so I need my wallet. You've gotta bring it to me you messed up. You've gotta make it right.\" Dude it's raining and late and \"I don't care man. That's my property\" well of course but we're friends and you should be able to trust me. \"That's not the issue. That's my property and you can't keep it. If you don't bring me my wallet you're no longer allowed at my house.\" \n\nOh? Well I guess I'm no longer allowed at your house and you can come get your wallet tonight if you really want to go out so badly this late. Otherwise you can wait til the morning before I go to work. And he decided to come get it. I ended up giving him 20 bucks as well since he drove out. And I guess we aren't friends anymore.\n\n Am I the asshole?\n\n*edit* someone said to edit the post and talk about the visual impairment of the rain. It was hard to see at points in time I don't know what you want me to say. It's florida, April, and if you live in florida you know chaotic the weather can be here. Sunny one spot, pouring the next, a drizzle here, and more pouring. So like that, except dark I guess.*\n\nAlso if you say he could've gotten hurt coming to get his wallet in the rain but call me an AH for not wanting to do the same to EITHER of us....then you're kinda the AH.", "created_utc": 1682401910, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12y9v15/aita_for_not_returning_my_friends_wallet/", "score": 4267, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Shit happens all the time and while ideally OP could/would make that drive, if they have safety concerns/work in the morning those strike me as pretty valid reasons not to go on a night drive. Hell, speaking from my own personal perspective, if a friend of mine just didn't feel like dropping a my wallet off bc they'd already called it a night, I'd be kind of annoyed but relieved that I lost only one night's worth of plans as opposed to the several nights lost if I'd just plain lost the thing.   \n\n\nSpeaking of, I dunno I kinda feel like pulling the \"it's my property\" card on a friend is just tacky as all hell. I can sympathize with wanting the wallet immediately to continue the night, but if the morning drop-off isn't gonna work, then there are any number of other arrangements we could come to that aren't childish ultimatums.
