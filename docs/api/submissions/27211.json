We had butter and margarine for anyone who wanted as well. \n\nOne of my boyfriend's friends is vegan and so is his partner. We made sure there were vegan snacks. \n\nBoth of them loved the bacon flavoured popcorn until someone told them what it was. \n\nOnce again the popcorn was 100% vegan. Popped in canola oil and with vegan flavour. \n\nBoth of them went off on us for serving them meat. I explained that the flavour was just salt and spices but they only got louder. I eventually got sick of their shit and pulled out the container of powder and asked them what ingredient they objected to. They read the label and went red faced. They said I wasn't clear when I said it was \"just flavour\". I'm pretty sure that is a full explanation and I said so. I asked them why they couldn't ask to see the package before scarfing down bags of popcorn. \n\nThey called me an asshole and left. My boyfriend thinks I was harsh.

We had butter and margarine for anyone who wanted as well. \n\nOne of my boyfriend's friends is vegan and so is his partner. We made sure there were vegan snacks. \n\nBoth of them loved the bacon flavoured popcorn until someone told them what it was. \n\nOnce again the popcorn was 100% vegan. Popped in canola oil and with vegan flavour. \n\nBoth of them went off on us for serving them meat. I explained that the flavour was just salt and spices but they only got louder. I eventually got sick of their shit and pulled out the container of powder and asked them what ingredient they objected to. They read the label and went red faced. They said I wasn't clear when I said it was \"just flavour\". I'm pretty sure that is a full explanation and I said so. I asked them why they couldn't ask to see the package before scarfing down bags of popcorn. \n\nThey called me an asshole and left. My boyfriend thinks I was harsh.

I read a whole study about it a while ago, and while I don't remember all the details, the gist is this:  \n\n\nWhen you take a drug, your stomach breaks down a lot of the drug into other stuff before it can actually reach your bloodstream, so you're only actually absorbing a certain percentage of what you took. So drugs are prescribed in doses that assume you will only be receiving that percentage.
