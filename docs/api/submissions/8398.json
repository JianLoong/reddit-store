But they also keep some existing traditions, particularly when those traditions are important to the family or central to the holiday.\n\nWould you think it appropriate to host a big Thanksgiving dinner where the piece de resistance is, I dunno, paneer tikka masala and not turkey, citing \"my house, my tradition\"? It is not uncommon to say a short prayer before Thanksgiving dinner (particularly if not geared to any particular denomination).\n\nThe only reason why you even ask this quesiton is because you dislike religion. Asking \"is everybody ready\" constitutes \"pre-prayer theatrics\" on what planet? \"Amen\" is \"rigamoroo\" (sic)?

So you know how to be a good guest but not a good host? \n\nWould have had more respect for you if you stood your ground at your uncle\u2019s house. Politely declining prayer doesn\u2019t make you bad guest. Forcing your guests to pray makes you a bad host and the AH would just be your uncle.   But YTA too because as a host you forbid guests to pray??", "My opinion is that YTA. I am atheist, however, I allow people into my home and they can come in and pray but they cannot come into my home and force me to pray. You could have allowed him and his family to partake and anyone else who didn\u2019t want to could be courteous while they prayed. Telling him to go to his car is disrespectful as a host, imo.", "NTA\n\nI agree with your views on this matter, your house your rules. But I would have stated this to him a few weeks before. Only because if he didn't feel comfortable in coming to yours he could have made other arrangements", "ESH\n\n\nI am 100% with you that your uncle is wrong by making you \"pray\" at his place. \n\n\nHowever, you refusing to let anyone pray at yours is as bad. Just let people believe what they want to believe, and pray if they want. Obviously, he can't make everyone pray at your place, but if he wants to bow his head for 30 seconds and finish with an amen, what's it to you?\n\n\nResponding to oppression with oppression just doesn't sit right with me. It was your opportunity to show how open atheists can be.", "NTA - Your house, your rules. Thanksgiving isn\u2019t a religious holiday so you\u2019re not depriving him on a day of worship.", "ESH. Did the situation escalate further than it should have? Yes. Should you have said go pray in your car? No. But Uncle should not have assumed things would be the same at your house as at his. If anything, you would have been the one to lead the prayer as you are the host, so he is overstepping. I do think you owe him an apology for what you said at the end however he owes you an apology for overstepping on your hosting and pushing a boundary you established.", "NTA. Your house, your rules, just like at your uncle\u2019s house. You\u2019re absolutely not being petty or a bad host. It fills my heart with joy that you told him he could pray in his car!", "ESH \n\nIt is your house, and you absolutely have the right to allow or disallow religious expression within your own home, but why couldn\u2019t you have at least given the religious members of your family a heads up that you would prefer that they did not have a formal prayer with the whole family before dinner? \n\nIt seems a little insensitive & disrespectful to spring this on the family (your uncle in particular) when you knew to expect this tradition to come up, and that the whole family was expecting this tradition as well. Sometimes, in dysfunctional families, you have to first model the behavior yourself that you\u2019d like to see in your loved ones in order for them to understand its value. This seems like a moment where that might have been useful.", "NTA.  Good on you!  Uncle sounds like a bully.", "ESH \u2026 when you signed up to host Thanksgiving, you knew about your uncle\u2019s propensity to pray and you should have quietly taken him aside, explained that your family is not religious and you would prefer that he and his family either silently say their own prayer or have a little prayer beforehand in a separate room.\n\nInstead, you waited till the turkey was on the table and made it a public confrontation over prayer.  As a guest and knowing that you weren\u2019t religious, he should NOT have been doing this at your house, but you should have anticipated the situation to avoid that public confrontation", "ESH. Not his place to make everyone pray in your home. You shouldn\u2019t have made him pray in his car. If he and his immediate family wanted to pray silently to themselves before eating, you should allow that, not suggest he go to his car. That\u2019s just rude", "YTA.  You couldn't give your uncle 2 minutes to say a prayer and told him in front of everyone else?  If you knew that you couldn't deal with a simple prayer, the least you could have done was tell them ahead of time.", "NTA no one should impose their religion on you. He can pray inwards to himself if it is a necessity for him. How do his actions benefit anyone who does not share his beliefs this is just a power trip.", "Ehhh, \\*slightly\\* YTA.\n\nYou invited your uncle knowing very well that his family like to pray before dinner. If you made your preferences clear beforehand, none of this awkward situation would've happened tbh.", "Yta. You could have handled this better. \"Ok we don't want to pray but you guys go ahead and we'll wait until you're done\"", "NTA. \n\nHe can pray all he wants. Bullying the rest of the family into doing so (especially the non-practicing/atheist family members) is pretty gross. He expects you to be respectful of his religion, but isn't respectful of yours in your own home? Nah. \n\nIf he wants to say grace, that's fine. Not his house not his rules, no one else has to join him. Frankly, I'm sick of a lot of the \"BuT tRaDiTiON\" bullshit.", "Hmmm\u2026 I think there was a better way for you to handle it. I think maybe letting him just go forward with it and then taking him aside and saying in the future you aren\u2019t comfortable with it and in the future for him to not do that. Or if you knew it was coming, you should have had the conversation ahead of time with him. Criticizing him in public in front of other family members definitely isn\u2019t the way to go and telling him to leave was pretty rude and unwarranted I think.\n\nIt makes me sad though as someone who does pray, that it means so much to us and only takes 1 minute out of your life to accommodate that you would want to stop it, especially on a day like thanksgiving. \n\nThat being said, I don\u2019t insist on praying at others houses because I do agree that you should default to the host\u2019s way of doing things\u2026. so idk ESH", "I mean, NTA but couldn\u2019t you have said \u201cif you want to say a quiet prayer yourself fine but we\u2019re not doing a group thing\u201d instead of sending him to his car?\n\nJust so you know he\u2019s probably going to insist on hosting it next year and during the prayer he will probably say something like \u201cand please forgive OP and bless their soul, hopefully they can find you and be saved\u201d", "YTA. It definitely would not have killed you to allow your religious uncle to take 15 seconds and pray. (Please feel free... But in this home if people don't want to join they don't have too) You're the reason Atheists get the bad name they do. You expect people to be tolerant of your disbelief, but never want to extend the courtesy.", "NTA\n\n  Why do everyone has to pray with him? He and his wife and kids could've prayed by themselves. When it was his house it made sense cause his house his rules. But he can't force everyone to pray in your house. I hate when people force their religious bs on others. Like, pray all you want, but don't force me to", "YTA for not saying it beforehand and causing a scene. Plus a good host doesn't tell his guests to go eat in their car. I come from a Catholic family and whilst its not me now, how would it have hurt to just let your family say a short prayer - \"rigamaroo\" (c'mon you're not being asked to sacrifice chickens here, rigamaroo my a) could have been the compromise. Say in your house you won't take part in saying Amen (rigamaroo? Really?) but you'll stay respectfully quiet whilst they observe their religion. Now you've caused such a stink that they might not accept another invitation from you.", "ESH. Your uncle because he clearly doesn't respect anyone else's beliefs or preferences, you because you could've permitted him to pray silently on his own before eating his own food instead of immediately jumping to the car ultimatum. On the whole he's worse than you, but you handled it poorly.", "It depends on how you said it and how he worded his response. From \u2018he said it\u2019s traditional and I said he can go sit in his car\u2019 then YTA but if he was more rude then NTA", "Soft YTA for entirely banning praying in your home. You had a perfect chance to have a conversation you should have had before along the lines of \"it's cool if you pray but we'll just be quiet\" and you overreacted in my opinion.", "ESH. I think sending him out to his car was a tad too much. Two wrongs don\u2019t really make a right.", ">Instead of foisting your preference on everyone,\n\nThat's what the uncle did when he made them pray \n\n>\"Amen\" is \"rigamoroo\" (sic)?\n\nIf rigamoroo means made up word who means nothing, yes. \n\n>But they also keep some existing traditions, particularly when those traditions are important to the family or central to the holiday.\n\n His family thanked him for not having to pray. Only uncle was the religious one. Anyone else couldn't give a shit. \n\n>It is not uncommon to say a short prayer before Thanksgiving dinner\n\nIt is if you're not religious.  And thanksgiving has nothing to do with religious events", "The tradition also started by his uncle was whoever owns the house gets to dictate other beliefs what to do on Thanksgiving. He is just following that. \nThere would not be any issue if uncle would\u2019ve been respectful to people who are not religious.", "Bullshit.\nHe\u2019s not preventing anyone from praying, just from making a big show of praying, where everyone has to participate.", "He could have prayed in silence while everyone started eating, I don\u2019t think anyone would have noticed but that\u2019s not how religious freaks operate, it has to be a show.", "This. It's op's house, I was with him till he told his uncle to pray in his car. That's spiteful and unnecessary. It'd have been fair if op allow whoever wants to pray, pray.

But it seems like it literally wouldn't have been an environment for the uncle to pay silently considering op literally told them to go to their car\n\nThat's where it became a poor host vs a guest overstepping", "Prob I had with Uncle is just stepping into that role in another family's house.  Unc cited \"tradition\", not duty which is rather telling.", "I don't think it's a refusing of allowing people to pray but rather not make it a spectacle. Most people pray silently on the regular. Its OPs house so their tradition. Uncle doesn't get to just come in and act like he's the host here as that's who would normally lead a prayer. I think the comment about go pray in your car was more because the uncle had escalated the situation the OP was getting frustrated or upset. No one would have cared or noticed if Uncle bowed his head for 30 seconds or so.", "But he also could have just prayed silently instead of making a fuss like they usually do since you were not initiating a prayer. I realistically hope you would not have an issue with him doing this and I would also hope that in the future he respects your wishes as well.", "OP didn't criticise his uncle at all. The onus should be on the guest to ask the host if it's okay to perform a ritual in their house. \n\nNTA", "Joke's on him, next year is the year we go see the In-laws, they're all atheists, so we can burn together.", "I don\u2019t think the issue is uncle praying, I think it\u2019s uncle demanding the whole family prays. If uncle wants the peace and quiet he demands from everyone, he can go to the car. I doubt OP has an issue if uncle prays quietly to himself at OP\u2019s house, but OP is free to correct me. \n\nI also see it as OP being courteous at uncle\u2019s home and joining the theatrics, but at OP\u2019s house it\u2019s uncle\u2019s turn to be courteous.", "Most of us atheists have been pushed and forced into believing or doing things we are not comfortable with all of our lives, just as his uncle every single thanksgiving.\nNo, it doesn\u2019t kill us but we are sick of us having to respect others while receiving 0 respect. \nHe would not have said anything if he hadn\u2019t been forced so many times to follow the uncle\u2019s rules.", "You don't force your religious beliefs on others, EVER. Yes, most people who don't believe in the church would consider this rigamaroo. This was petty but since OP was forced to participate when at Uncle's house it seems only fair that it goes both ways. \n\nYour religion is your business, don't make it others problem", "I guarantee ops uncle was not prepping for a silent prayer situation (also you need no one\u2019s permission to silently bless your food - you just do it\u2026 SILENTLY)", "A solution should have been found rather than him saying go eat in your car, that's all\n\nIt all escalated much more than necessary", "\"No, we're not doing that here\" absolutely implies he's not allowed to pray inside his home. So yes, he did stop him from doing it, in silence or out loud.", "You didn't need to pray with him. You could have easily had a 30-second moment of silence. That never killed anyone.", "Yeah, YTA.", "This all could have been avoided if the uncle wouldn't make that \"everyone prepare to pray\" show. He's not the host, so he's not the person to declare a prayer. It's not his place to do this. \n\nHe should have just sat there, and upon realising there is no public prayer could have prayed in silence. It's easy.\n\nIf he didn't make such a show of it and making it \"But it's tradition!\", OP wouldn't have told him so and it wouldn't have escalated. Nobody would have even noticed he prayed. \n\nBut instead, he chose confrontation.", "I totally agree that a firm \"it's not your house, you can't do that here\" is entirely warranted. But that, in my opinion, should have been followed with \"if you want to bow your head and pray, go ahead, but we don't enforce beliefs on other people in this house, so no one else has to\".", "This absolutely. OP is NTA.", "But OP is forcing his atheist beliefs on his vaguely/devout Catholic family who do this every year and avoided the issue up until dinner was served? If he and his wife had talked and decided beforehand, why couldn't he have had that discussion with the family too? \"Hey, I know that praying over dinner is important to you, wife and I dont want to take part so we won't\" Being a good host is more than 'your house, your rules' and having good relationships with people is more than 'turnabout is fair play', its not. Be a better human being.", "Not if he wants to impose the rule of \"everybody has to pray out loud\" as he does at his own house.\n\nWhich begs the question of how he would know if someone is not praying, if he's looking around to see he's not focused on his faith and the meaning of the prayer but on catching out the transgression. Which makes the whole thing performative bullshit to demonstrate his perceived superiority.\n\nNTA, OP, your house your rules.", "Why should OP's other guests be subjected to this? It's not Uncle's house.", "I agree. I just wrote my own comment with a ruling of ESH too and followed it up with something similar about allowing him to pray silently/not to the large group."]}
