Anything she asked for, our grandparents gave her no questions asked. Never saying no to her caused her to drain her entire 90K trust fund in less than a year when she turned 18 and started doing drugs. She lost custody of her first kid because of drugs but got sober and now has two little kids (ages 1&3). Nine months ago I had my first kid and money has been really tight so we can't afford a daycare, so we have my dad or my in-laws watch her so me and my husband can both work full time. My dad also on occasion watches my sister's kids. Mine and my husband's income combined is less than my sister's single income. Despite her making more money than both of us, she asks my dad for handouts constantly. A few years ago he paid for a car for $10k that she swore she'd pay back and never did. This year he bought her another car worth $40k and same thing, promised to pay him back and hasn't paid a dime. A few months ago my car broke down and my dad bought the car back for sentimental value (it was his mom's) and we used the money on a down payment for our other car. The only thing saving us from being extremely poor is my dad inherited his mom's house when he died but didn't want to move in. Instead, he offered to move my sister in rent free and she declined because it was a mess she didn't want to deal with. So, my dad moved me in and I cleaned it up and it's a nice house.\nStory: My dad was watching my daughter and got her the McDonald's Halloween bucket since it's small and she's a baby with full intensions of getting my niece and nephew bigger buckets since they're bigger kids. Sister saw the small Halloween bucket and freaked out on my dad, saying he loves my kid more than hers, saying stuff like \"f*** that baby you only care about her.\" Then proceeded to throw all my \"handouts\" in his face. I finally had enough and snapped and reminded her that my dad offered to move her into the house first and she declined, and he fully paid for two vehicles for her when all I got was 3k to put a down payment on a car I still have to pay $400/month for. I told her she's not special, just a whiney little brat that got everything handed to her as a kid and to this day as an adult expects everyone to bend to her will and kiss her ass. My dad said I was wrong for confronting her since she never said anything to me first, only yelled at my dad. But I don't take too kindly to people throwing my kids name out where it doesn't belong.

Your dad has some kind of issue standing up to your sister.  Her being angry about the Halloween bucket for no good reason could have been something you ignored... even \"f*** that baby\" maybe, but when she started yelling at him about YOU getting too much in handouts, that's it, now you were 100% involved and had no choice but to say something.", "**NTA.**\n\nEvery person has a breaking point, and you reached yours with her.\n\nYour father is a very good man for doing everything in his power to provide for you. He clearly loves his children and grandchildren dearly... but that also seems to be a key issue. He has unintentionally enabled your sister's behaviour by not putting his foot down and allowing her to abuse him in this way. \n\nYou clearly love him as well, so seeing him be abused yet again by the very same entitled brat who probably made a big fuss about you having a birthday party for her not getting attention when you guys were younger was the absolute final straw.\n\nYour opinion was valid, and please don't take it to heart that your father said you were wrong. I guarantee he absolutely cherishes deep down that you stood up for him, and he will definitely remember that moment forever.\n\nYou did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds like a spoiled brat, and your dad sounds like a door mat that gives her everything.

She needs put in her place and I'd personally have done so and then cut her out for ever saying anything about my child, but that's your choice. Your dad sounds like he needs a reality check as well.", "NTA your sister sounds like a complete, narcissistic brat.  She needed to be called out, even in this tiny manner.", "[removed]", "No I would cut her off in every way possible and if it got physical, I beat her up", "NTA- wow that sounds like a really entitled brat, this could have been easily avoided if your grandparents just gave a bit of cash for actually important things at the time", "NTA had to be said", "Oh she blew up even more threatening to get the court system involved because our grandma \"promised her the house\" but never had it in writing anywhere", "See idc what she says about me what sent me over the edge was her bringing my daughters name into it. I just threw her handouts in her face because I'm not gonna bring her children into an argument they don't belong", "I didn't get a trust fund it was from our great grandfather who died before he could split the trust fund between the two of us so she got it all. My sister was the first kid/grandkid so she was spoiled before she got out of the womb. I also think my grandma was extra loving to her because her name is one letter away from being the same name as my grandmas daughter that passed away when she was a year old. We have different moms, but my dad favored me as a kid because he was never 100% sure if my sister was his kid until later on in life but once he knew she was his and she had her first kid he immediately started kissing her ass too", "My dad's problem is he doesn't want to choose a side so tried to keep the middle ground of \"don't fight children xoxo\" even now that we're both grown adults.", "Like she's literally still an infant she'll be nine months old this month and she's cussing about her like it's her fault any of this happened", "I blocked her everywhere after I texted her and I'm doing my best to avoid her but we all live in the same town and it's very small so it'll be hard to avoid her 100%", "I'm surprised you didn't mentioned that last time court was involved in her case she lost custody of her child (and friendly reminder that she has a past as junkie).\n\nHaven't you thought she might be asking so much money not just because she's an entitled leech but because she's using again? (If she takes anyone to court you should demand an drug test)\n\nNTA", "Different people have different redlines.  \n\nPoint is she crossed both yours and mine.", "well still your father is an AH here, your sister is spoiled and entitled as hell and you grandparents are not so great either. \n\nWell good luck and I think you really ought to cease contact as much as possible, their toxicity could affect your kids as well.", "Yeah except theirs not much middle ground in buying one kid two cars and offering her a house and then allowing her to shit on your other child's kid and disrespect the shit out of you. Imo that's bad parenting 20 years too late and too late because now that she's an adult it's ganna get nasty to some capacity unless you just allow it. Which you absolutely shouldn't do ofc.", "See I'm trying to be a somewhat mature adults so that's the things I say to my friends when telling this story to them lol. But no he learned from her drug days to not give her the money directly but be there with her when it was spent. For example he was there when she got both cars to sign the checks, if she says she needs money for rent, he takes what she has and takes it to the post office for a cashier's check to mail directly to her landlord, if she says she needs grocery money he takes her to the store, etc.", "Oh yeah I totally agree. My dad did his best but he never really knew how to parent anyway it was ALWAYS the \"I don't care who started it I'm ending it\" argument even when it was something like her stealing my money when I was a teenager and she was on drugs. I also just let it happen but since having my daughter I've realized that if I wouldn't allow that kind of disrespect on her, I shouldn't allow it on myself", "*Mine and my husband's income combined is less than my sister's single income* \nShe is still asking for huge amounts of money, so unless she's very bad dealing with money her income is going somewhere.", "Not yourself and I hope you can convince your dad of the same. His missgivings if you will during your childhood are only an explanation not an excuse for continuation I know damn well that shit doesn't apply in other aspects of your sister's adult life now she can apply that to her family or loss them.", "True she smokes pot which so do I but from what I hear from my oldest nephew (her oldest kid, my dad has custody of him and she gets weekend visits) she buys a shit ton at a time and they don't actually grocery shop just buy snacks and eat out for every meal so it's real easy to lose money that way though. She's bipolar so she was always an emotional rollercoaster long before the drugs so I genuinely believe she's not on them currently", "NTA\n\nShe starts screaming at your dad, and then insults you and brings your kids into it?! Forget yelling at her, you had reasonable grounds to slap the ever-loving sh\\*t out of her.", "NTA but you need to get your dad to put your name on the deed of the house so you get it when he passes. If he won't, you need to stop putting any money into it at all. You know that your sister will fight you for it tooth and nail when the time comes. She can even legally move in and ruin your homelife if you both inherit it.", "NTA, your sister sounds insufferable!", "NTA OP", "How much time happened between *but my dad favored me as a kid because he was never 100% sure if my sister was his kid*\nand this *until later on in life but once he knew she was his and she had her first kid he immediately started kissing her ass too*.\n\nYou're saying you were the shiny golden child for some time for your father while your (around 7 years older?) sister had a deadbeat growing up until later on life.\n\nNo wonder your father trying to compensate your sister childhood with money now.", "He wasn't a dead beat he still provided for her but her mom and him were split and she chose to live with her mom and he got weekends. When him and my mom split I chose to live with him and so he favored me more. I should've specified it wasn't completely because he wasn't sure my sister was his kid, it was just a part of the reason.Then when my nephew was born when she was 18 and I was 11 he started sucking up to her so he could see his grandson"]}
