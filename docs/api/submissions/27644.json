As soon as you decided that they had abandoned you, you set things up to be as hands off as possible, and not it just sounds like you are trying to get back at them for their teenaged stupidity. \n\nParenthood doesn't stop at 18 and they could have used *constructive* guidance in their young adulthood. How many conversations did you have with them about financial responsibility and planning? They dropped out of school, but do you know why? Did you try to help them navigate that? Or did you just go all, not my prob, Bob? While you are under no obligation to finance their lives at this point, its sounds as if they both could use some adulting guidance.

I think there's so many missing reasons to this post. Like how old were the children when the custody agreement happened? why did they refuse to see him? Mom seems like the \"fun parent\" which would probably get old to teenagers and I'm surprised they didn't try to stay with Dad more. and he is abandoning his kids, he's not obligated to provide for them financially but he doesn't mention spending any time with them otherwise."]}
