As soon as you decided that they had abandoned you, you set things up to be as hands off as possible, and not it just sounds like you are trying to get back at them for their teenaged stupidity. \n\nParenthood doesn't stop at 18 and they could have used *constructive* guidance in their young adulthood. How many conversations did you have with them about financial responsibility and planning? They dropped out of school, but do you know why? Did you try to help them navigate that? Or did you just go all, not my prob, Bob? While you are under no obligation to finance their lives at this point, its sounds as if they both could use some adulting guidance.
