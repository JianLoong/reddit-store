As we were driving home from somewhere I told my husband that I know Saturday he sleeps in, but I seriously just needed a weekend where I could catch up on sleep. \nHe launches into a fight about how its not fair and he's tired too. He said I could sleep in if he could take a couple of naps on Saturday and Sunday. I told him sleeping in wasn't helpful if it meant I had to go solo on the weekend while he took two naps both days. He told me that's how relationships work and he's offering support but I have to be fair. I told him nevermind. I'll just get up. He responded that that was my problem and launches into a yelling tailspin on how i need to learn to be fair and no one said I couldn't sleep. I just need to let him nap.

Before I added in a pregnancy and work it was important to me that he came home and had nothing on his plate except focusing on the kids.

You need outside help.\n Do you have family or friends that can take the kids for a Saturday or Sunday so both you can nap?", "NTA but I'm hesitant to say more ad we don't really know enough....\n\nWhy choose to have a 3rd...also he works...is this a regular 8 hour a day job or is he working 12 hour days....\n\nCould it be your both exhausted and irrational and poor life choice makers", "My children's father contributed very little and I became exhausted, even sick.  I divorced him (for other reasons, but his selfish, infantile behavior was a real problem).  I was delighted to find my self in a much more enjoyable life after the divorce.  Not only did I not have another child to take care of in addition to the actual children, but I got total rest on the days/night he had the children.  I went from a haggard, depressed sick mother to young again in no time.", "Came here to say exactly that.\nShe is NTA, but this kind of behavior from him feels as norm in their marriage. Why would someone go and make 3 kids with such asshole, also when they obviously cannot afford it?", "That would be my question. I can\u2019t understand people who keep moaning about the challenges of having children with a difficult partner and they keep reproducing?! You\u2019re husband is a d!ck but YTA for continuing with this situation hoping it will change. Newsflash, it won\u2019t! What I can\u2019t understand, though, is why did you accept to do everything? Why doesn\u2019t he wake up at night when the little one wakes up? Why don\u2019t you share this load? Why didn\u2019t you put your foot down? In short, you seem to have plucked your eyes out with your own hands here. I\u2019m so sorry for you.", "[deleted]", "I always feel bad for children knowingly brought into these situations. They\u2019re the ones who have no say.", "This is the real question.", "Not really a fair question, birth control can fail sometimes.", "If you divorce him and get child support, you'll have the financial support he's providing without the emotional draining he's providing. Plus, if he has weekends with the kids, you'll actually get some time off.", "Honestly? He does nothing, he\u2019s lazy and by the sounds of it a terrible father who can\u2019t be bothered to deal with his own children. \n\nStop doing his laundry, stop cooking for him etc. Only worry about you and your own children. \n\nI\u2019d tell him he either gets his shit together and starts helping or he can start paying child support. Nta.", "Do you realize that if you get rid of him, you'll have less work and stress? You're handling 2 kids, one future and one adult-baby.... You can certainly take out from your shoulders the last one, because you're already doing everything for the other 3  \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "It's not much of a solution, but how is it narcissistic?", "Please please don\u2019t have a fourth \u2026or really a fifth.", "Oh stop. If he\u2019s going to act like a child he can be treated as one.", "Abortion never fails.", "Along with health issues with the pregnancy. Being tired and being fatigued are two entirely different things. Needing extra help during pregnancy is not a new thing, needing extra support from your spouse is expected. OP, you are not the AH. I'd rather be alone with 2 kids than 2 kids and a spouse who refuses to give me any extra help, while growing a person in me.", "For saying she should force surgery upon him", "That's why it's ESH.  He's an asshole, but it IS also his house.  Being a dick doesn't make you lose ownership of your home.\n\n\"Hey dude were a dick to me, sorry, the house is no longer yours.  I decided this suddenly\".  If she doesn't want to co-own a house, they should get a divorce.", "This is the best advice I\u2019ve ever read in this community.", "Didn\u2019t realise America made it legal again.\n\nBut even if it\u2019s not America, healthcare isn\u2019t free everywhere and abortion isn\u2019t legal everywhere. \n\nAbortion was only made legal in Ireland a few years ago. You make it sound like an easy alternative.", "Not everybody feels comfortable with abortion. Pro choice means the choice to choose.\n\nIn this case she should choose to leave this man because clearly she's gonna be looking after four kids once this one is born :/", "You are not a smart man.", "Ding ding ding", "\u201cHealthcare isn\u2019t free\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s a minute fraction of what having a child costs. Be real.", "So did she, and she has to handle the two existing children and she is pregnant. This isn't even in the same universe as \"fair\".", "Healthcare can also be practically impossible to access. Taking time off, going to where you need to go, waiting for the procedure, having it done and then going back home and taking time off to recover? These are all things not everyone can do. Healthcare, abortion included, is incredibly inaccessible in many states and you show your massive ignorance and priviledge with that comment.", "This is a nonsensical argument to try to make when pregnancy appointments and giving birth will take way more time then having an abortion."]}
