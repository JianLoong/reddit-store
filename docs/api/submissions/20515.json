He gets Saturday,  I get Sunday. \n\nLately however, I have been beyond extremely exhausted. I'm pregnant with our third and deal with hypothyroidism. Our second is going through a sleep regression and consistently wakes up in the night, something my husband never handles (which is fine). I have had to pick up a part time data entry job to help make ends meet, but we don't have the money for childcare. So during naps, down time, after bedtime I have been working. \nHe has started coming home complaining the house is a mess or dinner isn't ready, which I try to let roll off my shoulders. This is a new season we are both in after all. But it wears on me emotionally. \nI have expressed how tired I am and how I am in need of a little extra support. He gets frustrated and tells me he's just as tired. Hes had to pick up overtime and is feeling stress from that. Usually however that's where the conversation ends and I walk away feeling dismissed. \nThis past week was particularly rough. I felt I was at a breaking point and just needed some rest. As we were driving home from somewhere I told my husband that I know Saturday he sleeps in, but I seriously just needed a weekend where I could catch up on sleep. \nHe launches into a fight about how its not fair and he's tired too. He said I could sleep in if he could take a couple of naps on Saturday and Sunday. I told him sleeping in wasn't helpful if it meant I had to go solo on the weekend while he took two naps both days. He told me that's how relationships work and he's offering support but I have to be fair. I told him nevermind. I'll just get up. He responded that that was my problem and launches into a yelling tailspin on how i need to learn to be fair and no one said I couldn't sleep. I just need to let him nap. I'm the one making things worse. This is my own hole I'm digging\nOn and on and on. \nTo which I, at this point completely spent, pulled the car over and told him to find somewhere for the night, and then drove home. I felt in that moment being alone with the kids was better than being around someone but feeling alone. So, aita?\n\n\nEdit to add\n\n1.He is normally a very difficult person, which is made worse by our crazy busy schedule.\n\n2. I do normally handle all that comes with running a household. Before I added in a pregnancy and work it was important to me that he came home and had nothing on his plate except focusing on the kids. I obviously am not superwoman though and I don't think he's recognized that things on my end have changed. Maybe that's making him a tad bit irritated.", "created_utc": 1687650283, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14i76kh/aita_for_kicking_my_husband_out_over_naps/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or perhaps he has a mean streak that comes out when he's under stress. I can't tell, but either way, it's not good for your relationship. Especially because things are unlikely to get better once you have three children to wrangle instead of two.\n\nThe most urgent requirement here is for you both to get some rest.\n\nYou said you don't have the money for childcare. Is there a relative or friend who could watch the children for a day, or even a weekend, while you both catch up on sleep? If you have no one, then could you find some money in your budget to engage a professional carer, just for the day?

Being pregnant is tiring. And you have a lot more going on than just being tired. He does not sound like he is hearing you or giving you the support you need. That he is complaining that the house is messy is a huge AH move. \n\nI'm guessing you don't have family nearby that can help? It sounds like both of you could use  a break. And hubby sounds a bit selfish to me.\n\nI get why you kicked him out of the car, but don't think it was the best move so soft yta on that one. I fear that tmay make rational conversation harder to come by. But that's what you guys need. He may be tired and over worked, but that pales in comparison to 3rd pregnancy, hypothyroidism, taking care of kids night and day, house cleaning and doing part time work. I mean holy sh*t, that's a full load!! Keep talking until he gets it. Maybe write I down. Maybe go on strike (cleaning or nightime care, something) so that he can appreciate how much you have to deal with.

If he wanted to take two naps a day on the weekend then he shouldn\u2019t have had 2 (almost 3) kids. IMO you are contributing way more to the household than he is and he has no right to complain about things not being fair when he could cook or clean or get up with your second child in the middle of the night.

I know birth control isn\u2019t ever 100% but wow you guys should have thought this through more.", "YTA for kicking him out. It may have felt good in the moment, but it's not likely to make either of you any less frustrated or exhausted or overwhelmed.\n\nEveryone sucks for not fully considering the adjustments that needed to be made prior to conceiving a third child. If he's working overtime and you're working part-time  to make ends meet, you're overextended, to everyone's detriment.\n\nMake time to sit down with each other and discuss what tasks can wait, what you can do over the weekend so it doesn't have to be done during the week [meal prep might be a time and energy saver], tasks he can assume while you're working part-time, and so on. Presumably, you made this decision together, and you need to work out the issues together.\n\nAnd stop treating him as though his needs are less important than yours, or that he doesn't have the right to be in his own home.", "YTA for kicking him out.\n\nAs for the other issues, every one sucks. You\u2019re both exhausted and at the end of your ropes. This is a time to work together to figure out how to make it better. Playing the \u201cwho\u2019s more tired\u201d or \u201cwho\u2019s more stressed\u201d game leaves no one a winner. He offered some compromises. Try them and see if they work.
