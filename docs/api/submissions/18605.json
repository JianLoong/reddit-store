We\u2019re also fostering 3 kids, 2f, 3f, m8. Needless to say, we have a pretty full house. \n\nMy husband and Emilia have always had a difficult relationship. They\u2019re both pretty stubborn and butt heads a lot. We considered telling her social worker that it wasn\u2019t working out so many times, especially in the first year, because of how often they argued, how stressed the arguments made her, and because he has more of an authoritarian parenting style that she didn\u2019t respond well to. She and I have always been very close though and she considers me to be her mom. \n\nThe problem is, since we\u2019ve started fostering the younger 3, she\u2019s had to watch how good of a dad he is with the little ones and gets upset that he wasn\u2019t the same with her. It wasn\u2019t always rational but there was a lot of resentment and jealousy that she\u2019s having to work on. \n\nNow my husband has a niece (18f) who will be on her own this fall. She got a full scholarship to both the school 10 minutes from us and a school an hour away. My husband wants her to move in, he\u2019ll get her a car, and have her go to the school 10 minutes away with us financially supporting her. \n\nI don\u2019t want to do that. First, we already told Emilia that we will not be covering 100% of her expenses. She has a job and pays 1/2 of her car payment and insurance , all of her gas, maintenance, and repairs, pays her portion of the phone bill, and is responsible for all of her spending money. Us paying for all of that with his niece would hurt Emilia and he\u2019d either have to admit to having a favorite or we\u2019d have to fully support both. \n\nI said if she goes to the school an hour away (in an area with much cheaper rent), I wouldn\u2019t mind sending her some money every month to help out with rent and groceries with the expectation that she has a job and pays for some of her own expenses. He says we shouldn\u2019t expect her to be on her own yet and thinks that only partially supporting her is still too harsh. I told him that we can\u2019t do anything for his niece that we\u2019re not doing for Emilia but he thinks it\u2019s unfair to compare the two and says that Emilia should be grateful for what we provide for her no matter what others get. \n\nI don\u2019t like how he\u2019s going about it and he thinks I\u2019m spoiling Emilia and \u201cabandoning his niece to spare Emilia\u2019s feelings\u201d so I wanted to see if I was in the wrong.", "created_utc": 1685508418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13wckq0/aita_for_not_wanting_my_husbands_niece_to_move_in/", "score": 44, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She deserves to be treated as if she was your own. Where are the nieces parents? Why aren't they supporting their child? I think your husband is so wrong here, and it will cause huge issues within the family if he doesn't see where he is going wrong.", "He clearly is playing favorites. And this would be my hill to die on. \n\nNTA and please stand up for Emilia. You seem to be the only one in her corner.", "Nta. Clearly playing favorites just because the niece is related by blood. Where are the niece's parents? Fostering/adoption is traumatic enough as it is. Adding blatant favortism to the mix will mess up the poor girl a lot.", "NTA. He should be putting his children first, before his nieces and nephews. I have lots of feelings about this, and not enough words.", "NTA, it is super heartbreaking he has this attitude toward Emilia. She does not deserve to be expected to be happy taking whatever she can get just because she aged out of foster care. Offering to pay your niece\u2019s full expenses before a child you have helped raise and taken responsibility for in your own home is wild.", "NTA your husband should not be a foster parent.", "This is a tough one for me to weigh in on. But you're NTA. I can't call you the TA for wanting to spare Emilia's feelings.\n\nI really dislike your husband's cavaliere attitude, however, which seems to be that since Emilia is not a blood relative and she's aged out of foster care, she's not even entitled to be in your home at all and is there only by your goodwill.\n\nTechnically, this is accurate. But it's also rather callous and cruel when you consider Emilia is still a human being with feelings. And it's not her fault she's in foster care. But you made the decision to become foster parents. You want Emilia to feel like a daughter. Your husband wants her to feel like a charity case that is able to live comfortably and eat due to his \"generosity.\"\n\nI side with you. Emilia's still very young, and while the law dictates that she's an adult, her brain isn't fully formed until around 25. It's not Emilia being spoiled. It's his niece. Where are her parents? If she needs a car, her parents should be the ones to give it to her.", "NTA but I can't say the same for your husband.  He shouldn't be fostering children if he's not going to nurturing and treat them all fairly. Emilia is as good as being your own child at this point. If your husband wants to bring in his niece that's fine, but the rules have to be the same for her and Emilia. They are both practically the same age, so they should have the same amount of support.  The only thing I can think of that might be some kind of compromise is if you change the rule to something along the lines of they each have to contribute a certain percentage of their wage to their own bills, whether it be 50% of their wage or whatever. If Emilia is working more and making more, her 50% of wages will cover more than his nieces 50%, so in essence you will be providing more support to his niece, but it would still be fairer because it's relating to their individual contributions instead of favoritism.", "NTA. This was a tough one though. In his head, you can't compare. And in a way, I understand that. He has probably known and interacted with his neice for the whole of her life. This also says something about his stance on the whole \"blood is thicker than water\" thing, so if you want to have biological children someday and you want to also continue to foster or adopt, and it's important to you that he treat his foster and/or adopted kids the same as your biological ones, well, that just isn't going to happen, so if you want biological kids and someday have them then it wouldn't really be fair to adopt a child at that point. And if you want to continue to foster, you have to come to a place in your mind where you are okay with your husband treating the foster kids differently than your biological children. What made it NTA for me was that he thinks that your oldest Emilia should just be grateful for what she gets. That's an f'ed up attitude to have when you are acting as a foster parent. I get that Emilia is technically an adult now, but I have a feeling that that sentiment runs deep in him, and he probably feels like all the kids should just be grateful for what they get.\n\nSource: adopted kid.

If you can afford to do it for the niece maybe consider talking to Emilia about how she truly feels and if she would be more comfortable as a visitor.", "That\u2019s a good question\n\nA lot is missing. Does the husband want Emilia in the home? Did op force him to let her stay when she aged out? Is the husband happy with the arrangements? I would love to know all those details. OP only has her side. If he loves the other kids but tolerates Emilia what is going on, how is Emilia attitude? \n\nAlso why wouldn\u2019t she want Emilia to move out if she feels unwelcome? She\u2019s said herself that Emilia is sad that she doesn\u2019t get that love. Wouldn\u2019t it be better for her to be in a roommate situation too? \n\nLots of missing reasons"]}
