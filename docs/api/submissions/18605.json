We\u2019re also fostering 3 kids, 2f, 3f, m8. Needless to say, we have a pretty full house. \n\nMy husband and Emilia have always had a difficult relationship. They\u2019re both pretty stubborn and butt heads a lot. We considered telling her social worker that it wasn\u2019t working out so many times, especially in the first year, because of how often they argued, how stressed the arguments made her, and because he has more of an authoritarian parenting style that she didn\u2019t respond well to. She and I have always been very close though and she considers me to be her mom. \n\nThe problem is, since we\u2019ve started fostering the younger 3, she\u2019s had to watch how good of a dad he is with the little ones and gets upset that he wasn\u2019t the same with her. It wasn\u2019t always rational but there was a lot of resentment and jealousy that she\u2019s having to work on. \n\nNow my husband has a niece (18f) who will be on her own this fall. She got a full scholarship to both the school 10 minutes from us and a school an hour away. My husband wants her to move in, he\u2019ll get her a car, and have her go to the school 10 minutes away with us financially supporting her. \n\nI don\u2019t want to do that. First, we already told Emilia that we will not be covering 100% of her expenses. She has a job and pays 1/2 of her car payment and insurance , all of her gas, maintenance, and repairs, pays her portion of the phone bill, and is responsible for all of her spending money. Us paying for all of that with his niece would hurt Emilia and he\u2019d either have to admit to having a favorite or we\u2019d have to fully support both. \n\nI said if she goes to the school an hour away (in an area with much cheaper rent), I wouldn\u2019t mind sending her some money every month to help out with rent and groceries with the expectation that she has a job and pays for some of her own expenses. He says we shouldn\u2019t expect her to be on her own yet and thinks that only partially supporting her is still too harsh. I told him that we can\u2019t do anything for his niece that we\u2019re not doing for Emilia but he thinks it\u2019s unfair to compare the two and says that Emilia should be grateful for what we provide for her no matter what others get. \n\nI don\u2019t like how he\u2019s going about it and he thinks I\u2019m spoiling Emilia and \u201cabandoning his niece to spare Emilia\u2019s feelings\u201d so I wanted to see if I was in the wrong.", "created_utc": 1685508418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13wckq0/aita_for_not_wanting_my_husbands_niece_to_move_in/", "score": 3101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And this would be my hill to die on. \n\nNTA and please stand up for Emilia. You seem to be the only one in her corner.", "Nta. Clearly playing favorites just because the niece is related by blood. Where are the niece's parents? Fostering/adoption is traumatic enough as it is. Adding blatant favortism to the mix will mess up the poor girl a lot.", "NTA. He should be putting his children first, before his nieces and nephews. I have lots of feelings about this, and not enough words.", "NTA, it is super heartbreaking he has this attitude toward Emilia. She does not deserve to be expected to be happy taking whatever she can get just because she aged out of foster care. Offering to pay your niece\u2019s full expenses before a child you have helped raise and taken responsibility for in your own home is wild.", "NTA your husband should not be a foster parent.", "This is a tough one for me to weigh in on. But you're NTA. I can't call you the TA for wanting to spare Emilia's feelings.\n\nI really dislike your husband's cavaliere attitude, however, which seems to be that since Emilia is not a blood relative and she's aged out of foster care, she's not even entitled to be in your home at all and is there only by your goodwill.\n\nTechnically, this is accurate. But it's also rather callous and cruel when you consider Emilia is still a human being with feelings. And it's not her fault she's in foster care. But you made the decision to become foster parents. You want Emilia to feel like a daughter. Your husband wants her to feel like a charity case that is able to live comfortably and eat due to his \"generosity.\"\n\nI side with you. Emilia's still very young, and while the law dictates that she's an adult, her brain isn't fully formed until around 25. It's not Emilia being spoiled. It's his niece. Where are her parents? If she needs a car, her parents should be the ones to give it to her.", "NTA but I can't say the same for your husband.  He shouldn't be fostering children if he's not going to nurturing and treat them all fairly. Emilia is as good as being your own child at this point. If your husband wants to bring in his niece that's fine, but the rules have to be the same for her and Emilia. They are both practically the same age, so they should have the same amount of support.  The only thing I can think of that might be some kind of compromise is if you change the rule to something along the lines of they each have to contribute a certain percentage of their wage to their own bills, whether it be 50% of their wage or whatever. If Emilia is working more and making more, her 50% of wages will cover more than his nieces 50%, so in essence you will be providing more support to his niece, but it would still be fairer because it's relating to their individual contributions instead of favoritism.", "NTA. This was a tough one though. In his head, you can't compare. And in a way, I understand that. He has probably known and interacted with his neice for the whole of her life. This also says something about his stance on the whole \"blood is thicker than water\" thing, so if you want to have biological children someday and you want to also continue to foster or adopt, and it's important to you that he treat his foster and/or adopted kids the same as your biological ones, well, that just isn't going to happen, so if you have biological kids and someday, then it wouldn't really be fair to adopt a child at that point. And if you want to continue to foster, you have to come to a place in your mind where you are okay with your husband treating the foster kids differently than your biological children. What made it NTA for me was that he thinks that your oldest Emilia should just be grateful for what she gets. That's an f'ed up attitude to have when you are acting as a foster parent. I get that Emilia is technically an adult now, but I have a feeling that that sentiment runs deep in him, and he probably feels like all the kids should just be grateful for what they get.\n\nSource: adopted kid.

Your husband sucks for half-assing your compromise on keeping Emilia at home while not covering her full-expense, because he didn't want to pay for anything and you wanted to pay for all of it. An important part of half-assing it is not trying to improve a relationship with someone living under his(your) roof, especially when he's an authority figure over her (as a former foster parent).\n2. OP, you suck for knowing that your niece is being kicked out this summer but not even knowing *why*, and then not elaborating on why you're not asking your husband about it. It's astounding to me that someone who's been this kind to her foster children can look the other way when another child, from her husband's family, might be in dire straits. It's not that you want equality for Emilia and her, it's that you are actively not assessing their whole individual situations and backgrounds. That's not a fair way to decide what's equal treatment, because they don't have equal backgrounds.\n\nOverall, I think your position comes from a long time of overcompensating for Emilia, and maybe if you talked with your husband about your niece's whole situation THEN exposing that situation to Emilia herself, you all might come up with a solution that suits your niece and doesn't make Emilia feel like she's less than family. I'm sure she's old enough to understand that maybe your niece needs a bit more help than her.

There\u2019s a reason you have no kids adopted or otherwise. Your foster is still there because you want her, and he is supporting your decision by accepting it. He is his own person. Leave him be. \n\n2) what about your finances? Do you earn more? Does he? Will what he wants to give his niece negatively affect your finances? Will he be solely using his funds or majority yours? If he uses his own, then you have no right to dictate what he does with his money. You also mentioned health problems that Emilia has - how much do you spend on her medical bills? \n\n3) he is a wonderful dad to the other three children you are fostering. So he has a good relationship with 4/5 kids involved. How is he a bad person? \n\n4) Emilia will have issues that he is supporting his niece who has gotten a full scholarship? Is she in therapy? Proper therapy to work through her abandoned issues and her sense of entitlement? It\u2019s a shitty thing to say, but your husband is correct.

She too didn\u2019t ask for crappy parents. She also worked hard enough to get scholarships to TWO different schools. She has lived at home with probably no street sense and you\u2019re expecting her to have the same hard exterior as Emilia who has had years of strengthening herself. They are two different girls from different backgrounds and you think they need to be treated the same? So psychologically damaging the niece would be acceptable to you?

Has he felt unappreciated, or disrespected in this relationship and is waiting for her to move on? Being close to you and not with him might be making a difference here. Will you be able to afford the same offer for the other 3 as you have for Emilia? Do you think the kids in his family should get less financial help? You need to be on the same page here too.

We did have a bit of leniency with little kids as they just struggle to understand, but it was still discouraged. Most of the older ones didn't want you to be their parent though, so there was only the odd occasion where a chat was necessary. Usually though, this was discussed with the kids by the social worker before they came, so they'd tell us what they'd like our relationship to be described as in public.\n\nLots of things you'd naturally do are discouraged for your own safety though. Things like sitting on the bed to read or give a cuddle were a big no no. We could never do that with littlies. I'd challenge anyone to be faced with a terrified/lonely/upset child and not sit and give them a cuddle, even if it was when they were in bed.

They are providing Emilia with a roof over her head, drug free home, food, transportation to school, etc. \n\nI don't believe most of the commenters here understand that there is a not tiny difference between fostering and adoption.  Fostering is meant to be temporary.  Why are people imposing permanent parenthood onto this husband and wife just because they chose to offer a temporary home to a foster child?

Would husband be required to shell out 80,000 dollars for an education?  Should he have to foot an ivy league education? At what point does the fostering mean nothing and suddenly he has to become a bank account for any teenager they bailed out of a tough situation.  \n\nYTA OP.  Emilia was never promised a free education and free housing for life.  But you told your husband: \"I told him that we can\u2019t do anything for his niece that we\u2019re not doing for Emilia\".  This type of unilateral decision without any discussion at all is very unhealthy.  The nieces' situation is different than Emilia.

You have already indicated that you don't want the niece in your house, going so far as to offer to pay her to live miles away from her family.

You resent his willingness to do something nice for HIS niece, but is not willing to go the same distance for YOUR heart-daughter.  Everything you're putting on your husband, you are modeling with the niece.\n\nYTA", "Also authoritarian parenting is the worst.

Not ideal, but it does happen - especially when we're talking a kid who was already in her teens when they took her in. He's not really a bad guy for not bonding with her.

She is their daughter, and his niece is not.

Many of those situations do not result in familial like bonds through no fault of the persons involved.  It's difficult to establish a family bond given the ages of the kids, particularly considering the kids have often spent years in foster care elsewhere, group homes or bounced around between the two.  The foster father may not be treated the kids differently, i.e. unfairly, but simply parenting based upon their ages and needs.", "When you foster you are taking on a guardian role for a specified period of time. So husband did fulfill the responsibility he took on. Everyone (the adults and teenager) knows going into it that its temporary and the kids can be removed at any time if its not working out or the bio family gets their act together.\n\nThat is very different from being a parent (either through adoption or biology), in which case I agree, the moral obligation of a parent to a child extends beyond age 18.\n\nOP feels a continuing responsibility because of the emotional relationship she developed  - great. It's okay that husband didn't - not everyone is going to instantly bond. \n\nYou really don't seem to understand the distinctions here.

When they began to foster, he agreed to be a guardian for a limited period of time - again, he fulfilled that. \n\nOP isn't dictating yet - but if she unilaterally says that niece can't stay but her daughter can - yeah that's dictating.
