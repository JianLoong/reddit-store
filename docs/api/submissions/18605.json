We\u2019re also fostering 3 kids, 2f, 3f, m8. Needless to say, we have a pretty full house. \n\nMy husband and Emilia have always had a difficult relationship. They\u2019re both pretty stubborn and butt heads a lot. We considered telling her social worker that it wasn\u2019t working out so many times, especially in the first year, because of how often they argued, how stressed the arguments made her, and because he has more of an authoritarian parenting style that she didn\u2019t respond well to. She and I have always been very close though and she considers me to be her mom. \n\nThe problem is, since we\u2019ve started fostering the younger 3, she\u2019s had to watch how good of a dad he is with the little ones and gets upset that he wasn\u2019t the same with her. It wasn\u2019t always rational but there was a lot of resentment and jealousy that she\u2019s having to work on. \n\nNow my husband has a niece (18f) who will be on her own this fall. She got a full scholarship to both the school 10 minutes from us and a school an hour away. My husband wants her to move in, he\u2019ll get her a car, and have her go to the school 10 minutes away with us financially supporting her. \n\nI don\u2019t want to do that. First, we already told Emilia that we will not be covering 100% of her expenses. She has a job and pays 1/2 of her car payment and insurance , all of her gas, maintenance, and repairs, pays her portion of the phone bill, and is responsible for all of her spending money. Us paying for all of that with his niece would hurt Emilia and he\u2019d either have to admit to having a favorite or we\u2019d have to fully support both. \n\nI said if she goes to the school an hour away (in an area with much cheaper rent), I wouldn\u2019t mind sending her some money every month to help out with rent and groceries with the expectation that she has a job and pays for some of her own expenses. He says we shouldn\u2019t expect her to be on her own yet and thinks that only partially supporting her is still too harsh. I told him that we can\u2019t do anything for his niece that we\u2019re not doing for Emilia but he thinks it\u2019s unfair to compare the two and says that Emilia should be grateful for what we provide for her no matter what others get. \n\nI don\u2019t like how he\u2019s going about it and he thinks I\u2019m spoiling Emilia and \u201cabandoning his niece to spare Emilia\u2019s feelings\u201d so I wanted to see if I was in the wrong.", "created_utc": 1685508418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13wckq0/aita_for_not_wanting_my_husbands_niece_to_move_in/", "score": 791, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think your husband is so wrong here, and it will cause huge issues within the family if he doesn't see where he is going wrong.", "He clearly is playing favorites. And this would be my hill to die on. \n\nNTA and please stand up for Emilia. You seem to be the only one in her corner.", "Nta. Clearly playing favorites just because the niece is related by blood. Where are the niece's parents? Fostering/adoption is traumatic enough as it is. Adding blatant favortism to the mix will mess up the poor girl a lot.", "NTA. He should be putting his children first, before his nieces and nephews. I have lots of feelings about this, and not enough words.", "NTA, it is super heartbreaking he has this attitude toward Emilia. She does not deserve to be expected to be happy taking whatever she can get just because she aged out of foster care. Offering to pay your niece\u2019s full expenses before a child you have helped raise and taken responsibility for in your own home is wild.", "NTA your husband should not be a foster parent.", "This is a tough one for me to weigh in on. But you're NTA. I can't call you the TA for wanting to spare Emilia's feelings.\n\nI really dislike your husband's cavaliere attitude, however, which seems to be that since Emilia is not a blood relative and she's aged out of foster care, she's not even entitled to be in your home at all and is there only by your goodwill.\n\nTechnically, this is accurate. But it's also rather callous and cruel when you consider Emilia is still a human being with feelings. And it's not her fault she's in foster care. But you made the decision to become foster parents. You want Emilia to feel like a daughter. Your husband wants her to feel like a charity case that is able to live comfortably and eat due to his \"generosity.\"\n\nI side with you. Emilia's still very young, and while the law dictates that she's an adult, her brain isn't fully formed until around 25. It's not Emilia being spoiled. It's his niece. Where are her parents? If she needs a car, her parents should be the ones to give it to her.", "NTA but I can't say the same for your husband.  He shouldn't be fostering children if he's not going to nurturing and treat them all fairly. Emilia is as good as being your own child at this point. If your husband wants to bring in his niece that's fine, but the rules have to be the same for her and Emilia. They are both practically the same age, so they should have the same amount of support.  The only thing I can think of that might be some kind of compromise is if you change the rule to something along the lines of they each have to contribute a certain percentage of their wage to their own bills, whether it be 50% of their wage or whatever. If Emilia is working more and making more, her 50% of wages will cover more than his nieces 50%, so in essence you will be providing more support to his niece, but it would still be fairer because it's relating to their individual contributions instead of favoritism.", "NTA. This was a tough one though. In his head, you can't compare. And in a way, I understand that. He has probably known and interacted with his neice for the whole of her life. This also says something about his stance on the whole \"blood is thicker than water\" thing, so if you want to have biological children someday and you want to also continue to foster or adopt, and it's important to you that he treat his foster and/or adopted kids the same as your biological ones, well, that just isn't going to happen, so if you want biological kids and someday have them then it wouldn't really be fair to adopt a child at that point. And if you want to continue to foster, you have to come to a place in your mind where you are okay with your husband treating the foster kids differently than your biological children. What made it NTA for me was that he thinks that your oldest Emilia should just be grateful for what she gets. That's an f'ed up attitude to have when you are acting as a foster parent. I get that Emilia is technically an adult now, but I have a feeling that that sentiment runs deep in him, and he probably feels like all the kids should just be grateful for what they get.\n\nSource: adopted kid.

It sounds like OP/husband probably have money (wanting to fully fund niece's life, and OP's concern being fairness not budget) but people can be weird", "INFO: have there been discussions on why her family is kicking her out? \nWhat is the current family dynamic with niece\u2019s parents that your husband immediately jumped at taking her in and fully supporting her financially?", "Why are nieces parents kicking her out after summer?  They are just washing their hands of her?  Sounds strange.  Does she have issues or are her parents just jerks?", "I see butting heads and stubborn a lit in your post. My father took the authoritarian parenting in stride and let me know that if I didn't fully agree with his opinions and do exactly as he said, that I was lazy, immature (as a child!), and an all around bad girl.\n\nIt sounds like your husband, the dictator of the household, doesn't like other opinions and actions. He shouldn't be around fosters with that attitude, period.", "It\u2019s not favouritism, one is family, the other is a spoiled brat who never even liked him? \n\nThen has the gall to act jealous lmao", "He doesn't throw her scrapes tho. She's very well taken care of", "That's strange, in my country you can adopt adults. My second year at uni I noticed that one of my friends had changed family names (which is very difficult un my country) and I asked him how he had done it... Turns out he was a fostered kid, his birth family had always opposed his adoption and once he was 18 he was able to petition the court by himself to be adopted into his foster family.", "Not true. In New York you can adopt adults with their consent. It\u2019s based on state law so it might be legal in OPs state.\n\nhttps://affcny.org/adult-adoption-in-new-york/", "That must be state specific because you can be adopted as an adult in my state.", "Colorado has adult adoption.", "Adults can be adopted in all states.", "Or have their own.", ".... the niece is in no way the same? Do you understand what a niece is?", ">Foster is suppose to be temporary.\n\nDid you miss the part where they chose to keep her on as an adult?", "[deleted]", ">She like thousands of other students can get a job to help support herself.\n\nI agree the responsibility to Emilia out weighs the one to the neice, but it is unreasonable to expect an 18 year old in this day and age to be able to support themselves with a part time job, while in college with no parental support.", "My desk chair psychology opinion: I don't think it's about money. Since Emilia came to them as a teen with a whole attitude to match, OP husband feels like she is ungrateful. OP husband probably wanted to send her back, but succumbed to the pressure of OP to keep her. I agree, they probably have money and OP does not work. He probably found Emilia to be disrespectful and OP was giving her passes, because she felt her husband was in the wrong. When they fostered the other 3, they didn't come with all that attic, so he could be more relaxed with them. He probably looks at Emilia as OP's project and his niece is family.", "That is completely not possible in like 90% or more of America. it\u2019s my least favorite thing about this place. I hate it so much I studied this problem in grad school.", "I'm American, my work is a 30 minute *drive* from my house.\n\nDo you know how long that would take on bike?", "Seems like they're another person who confuses moral responsibility with legal responsibility", ">It seems his parenting style works well for the three other foster children\n\nWhat you mean the literal toddlers? His parenting style has zero impact on that, all they will be doing is putting the coloured block in the right place.\n\nDo you even know what a 3 year old is like? Also their Niece doesn't live with them yet!", "Fostering a child should be a joint decision. But it seems OP just imposed Emilia on her husband. Not saying she doesn't deserve less but the niece is the one he watched grow and is clearly much attached to. He is going to be attached same way to the younger kids but first niece should be punished for not being a foster kid. \n\nEmilia has problems with the husband's bond  younger kids too.", "Yes, they signed up to raise her and they are the closest thing to parents she has. Parent - child relationships are not about legalities.", "A \"spoiled brat\"? Where did you get that from?", "So gross.", "Then she is an adult who is living with them.  Not a foster child", "She should but I didn\u2019t read that she was.  And her foster parents should help with school", "I know there are many parents that behave like that. Some have no reason and some have very good reasons.", "The niece should get a part time job so that she is helping towards her living expenses, she should be getting the same as Emilia. No more no less. She will still be getting more support from OP and her uncle than she is getting from her own parents.", "Mine is 40. On highway. It's 45 miles. Through mountains. \n\nIf the cars didn't kill me trying to bike, the cardio would \ud83e\udd23", "Umm there is an 8 year old in the mix and he obviously knows his niece who is 18.", "Have they signed to rise her? Where I live fostering 15 years old means basically accomodating them because adoption system failed and they aren't going to be adopted, so they need a place to live to not stay in orphan house. And fostering a teenager doesn't mean rising them or parenting them. You're more like a nanny in kids camp. \n\nIs it different in where you live? Because this could be a key. Reddit clearly thinks that fostering is parenting. When in at least some places fostering is \"kids camp\" situation.", "Apparently my previous comment deleted itself \ud83e\udee0 \n\nFor record, I asked why Emilia shouldn't go to school. (Mostly cause I misread the previous comment slightly) \n\nOP said that Emilia is in school in a comment, and they help with what her scholarship doesn't cover, but she's still responsible for some other expenses. \n\nCompared to niece, who OP's husband wants responsible for 0 expenses.", "Not true. The OP said she\u2019d be fine sending money to help with rent and food.", "I replied to someone not op. You don\u2019t have to read it", "Maybe one (or both) of the girls is fine with moving out to go college? I understand the niece situation is different (she's being kicked by her own parents) but for me going to college in a different city (with my parents financial support) was a dream come true. Moving in with people my age, my first actual parties, lots of other activities with new friends. It's not always \"living with strangers\" vs living with the family. Asking both girls what's they think is best for them is a good idea too. Probably better without your husband present.\n\nBTW OP is not the AH, the husband is.", "Hmmm, you commented to OP **eight** times in addition to a few more comments made to other Redditors. This is obsessive and fairly creepy.", "I replied to op, but after she stopped replying I didn\u2019t send anymore. I replied to others . I did realize I double commented. That doesn\u2019t qualify me as any of those things. I am up and bored, plus curious. Op didn\u2019t answer my last question and that\u2019s up to them. I have neither messaged op or further asked her questions. I haven\u2019t tagged her either, \n\n\nMaybe you should look up those definitions. I would love to know how the husband feels, but I won\u2019t be getting that answer. \n\nNow I do hope Emilia meets a real group of friends and makes her own family where she\u2019s wanted by everyone in her home. \n\nHave a wonderful day. I will try to sleep now."]}
