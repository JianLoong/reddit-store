Do not bring it up if you see them. What if a peeper was looking on in your? Be safe!", "ESH.  Walking around in your underwear in front of an open window, yeah\u2026.doesn\u2019t matter the whole \u2018your house your rules\u2019 answers here.   I\u2019m sorry nothing wrong with your attire, but not in front of an open window, knowingly\u2026.then you say \u2018you feel weird having to watch what I wear at night\u2019\u2026again, open window, so, you need to.  Get a shade/curtain or dress appropriately.  They are also the assholes for coming over at the first instance. They of course can ALSO get a shade", "I thought of this too! I go to the gym every day and come in wearing my sports bra and leggings, is this also in appropriate? Where does the line stop? Lmao", "I say do this anyway!  Bet it is liberating!", "The neighbour could buy herself a pair of blinds... \n\nTotally agree. It's OP's house, indeed, (un)dress as you like. You're not responsible for their argument.", "Honestly, I don\u2019t know why. I regretted it afterward but I didn\u2019t want to cause any problems.", "I love this", "Their house is On a slightly higher level than mine (if that makes sense) so their window sort of looks down onto mine and therefore below the counters especially when I\u2019m on the far side of the kitchen from the window. I\u2019m over it now but defo getting myself some blinds and then to celebrate might prance about completely naked lmao.", "Somehow I feel like he'd be mortified to find that his wife approached her...because then it's all out in the open that he'd been gawking", "Lmfaoooooo", "Not blinds, but those wondow stickers that allow OP to see outside but do not allow anybody to see inside", "Yes she didn\u2019t berate me at all, she was actually fairly nice. I just feel uncomfortable about the whole situation, and didn\u2019t want to cause any issues. I never got myself blinds before as where my kitchen is, quite a lot of my house and my neighbours house blocks the sunlight. But defo gonna get some after tonight lol.", "Not necessarily a right: https://www.hg.org/legal-articles/indecent-exposure-can-i-be-charged-if-i-am-naked-in-my-own-home-52610", "Lol thank you, you\u2019re right. Gonna order myself some blinds tomorrow to avoid any further issues eeek!!", "you should be able to wear anything you want in ur own house dude, just don\u2019t be a perv about it", "No. They can hang their own blinds or Curtains and stop being peeping toms. Everyone knows proper etiquette is to not stare in the window of someone else\u2019s home. If they don\u2019t want to see it, they can hang their own blinds. \n\nFurthermore she was wearing a lot more than a bikini would cover so she wasn\u2019t at all indecent. Female Neighbor is just annoyed she caught her husband perving by checking out the young female neighbor.", "Or they can mind their business?", "Get the fuck out of here.", "Or, the neighbors that might actually have blinds and have the problem with looking in windows could close THEIR blinds. Just a thought.", "Also I see a lot of people saying you can do whatever you want in your own house. Here\u2019s a link for all of you to consider. \n\nhttps://www.hg.org/legal-articles/indecent-exposure-can-i-be-charged-if-i-am-naked-in-my-own-home-52610", "Suns like she caught her husband creeping on you and is asking you to change your behaviour rather than holding him accountable for his. \n\nWould something you can stick on your windows that lets light through but distorts the image be an option?", "I'm sure the neighbor has blinds and the husband just isn't using them. The \"argument\" was almost assuredly \"Why are you looking at the neighbor?\"", "Doesn\u2019t seem like their window is the problem,\nMore like the husband is looking into a neighbors window.\n\nHe needs to chill.\n\nI saw my neighbor\u2019s wife one time from her kitchen window while painting the baby room and felt awkward. And we are on great terms.", "Prancing is essential.  Glad you're getting blinds.", "I see some people recommending some sort of one-way film. Maybe that stuff lets in sunlight? Good luck and Happy New Year (and congrats on the house!).", "Definitely try the window films! I know they can also help keep warmth in during the winter can and come in plain or intricate patterns. \n\nYour NTA, but also I think this is a good lesson to take to heart. You should wear/not wear what you want in your house, but take precautions to protect yourself from unwanted voyeurs. It\u2019s not about right or wrong, but safety. Put the film out and dance naked, in a ball gown with peace of mind!", "You did nothing wrong. You are allowed to wear whatever you want in your own house. There is nothing \u201cunneighborly\u201d about what you did. If a man gets in a fight with his wife because a woman exists in her own home in clothes she\u2019s comfortable with, that\u2019s on him, not on you. And it\u2019s gross people are blaming you for his inability to control himself. Edit: I would still get blinds or curtains though, but only because your neighbor showed himself to be a creep.", "That's right. It has much to do with intent.", "If you live in a house made of glass across from an elementary school is it appropriate to stand by the window with your cock out? That's not how indecent exposure law works actually. In this case she was wearing underwear but the same idea applies. Even if someone can legally do something doesn't mean they shouldn't have consideration for others.", "Ummm it sounds like she has a husband problem and that is 100% not your problem. You have worked hard to own a home and a big part of that is being able to wear whatever you want or don\u2019t want. If it\u2019s an issue for them, they can buy blinds. \nIt\u2019s a good thing they aren\u2019t my neighbors because I walk around in less than you. I suspect if you walked around in nothing for a while she would get blinds real fast!", "Yes I always feel weird when I can see people in their houses especially at night. Even when I just happen to glance over because I noticed motion out of the corner of my eye.", "That\u2019s clearly not the situation and op was wearing more than what a bathing suit would show", "So it's bad, but bad to a lesser degree."]}
