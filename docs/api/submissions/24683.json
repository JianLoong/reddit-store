This isn't a ripoff \"exposure\" gig; these things have material value and potential short cuts to getting better positions sooner.\n\nMost importantly, you are offering it in semester, so whatever housing and supports they have in place for school will sustain them.

Since you're clearly hiring for statistical work and data cleaning that you'd otherwise have to pay for, it seems unlikely that you'd pass this test. Additionally, noting there is a potential for hire at graduation actually makes your unpaid internship *less* legal, as one of the requirements for an unpaid internship is a clear understanding this does not guarantee a job.", "NAH,as long as you are transparent about it", "NTA, if the interns want to work unpaid for academic credit, they can.

In theory he could have gotten a job in addition or gone through some labyrinthine process to get around the requirement, but ultimately it highlighted the wealth and entitlement of the program.", "I can't jump straight for YTA here.

No thank you. \n\nHypothetically, if you were to just do it anyway: as long as you make it VERY CLEAR that no money will come of it, anybody that takes the job (if they do) will be knowingly taking a job with no pay.

Personally I\u2019m not crazy about seeking unpaid labor but I know if I was in school I would jump at the chance. There would be potential for hire at graduation and this would be in semester.

Ypu literally said you want to *use* them for data cleanup and statistical work. IMO: paid interns do work, unpaid interns should be shadowing and getting taught lessons primarily.\n\nGood rule of thumb, imo, would be if having an intern is going to cost the company time and not generate extra revenue because someone's going to need to be teaching them the things that you would take for granted from a full graduated hire, unpaid is cool. You are paying them for anything they do end up doing as practice in all the extra labour hours it takes to teach someone who hasn't already got the degree. \n\nIf they're getting a days worth of lessons and then benefiting by practicing the skills their degree already taught them, ergo going right to work... then they should be paid. \n\nYTA probably.", "Why don't you set it up as an internship for credit and then pay them a performance bonus when you have the funds in a few months? If they are working for the semester, then they will still be there when the funds come in. I would not do it if there is no pay involved eventually. They are paying tuition money to work for you, and that feels a bit gross to me and to you as well or you wouldn't be posting here.", "YTA- People deserved to be compensated for the work and value they bring to a company. Internships are an exploitative way to maximise on peoples work without denting the budget by paying them.", "Good luck finding interns that can perform statistical work that are also willing to work for school credit only. You are going to face a ton of competition from companies that actually pay their interns.", "NTA if you do it right. If you register eith the university so that the time they spend at the internship equates to the the time they would otherwise spend in a class and they revieve credit towards their graduation then they are not in my eyes un paid. They are receiving compensation. To make it fair to everyone, anyone in my program could apply to the internship. They are doing an internship instead of class work. I did on and the money i was paying in tuition for those credits was used to provide transportation to the internship. I gained valuable ecperience and class credit for arguably less time worked if I had taken normal classes. I also had no homework or exams which for sure saved me time and stress.", "YTA! Ffs mate", "YTA, labour should never be free, and I paid internships perpetuate class bias.", "NAH\n\nIf it's an actual learning experience go for it.\n\nBut honestly if you need 2-3 interns you should get a budget for it. I'd only do unpaid interns if I had 2-5 people per intern spending time to teach the intern. An Intern is supposed to cost the business and you in the form of time and training. If you can't afford to pay an intern minimum wage, I can't imagine your organization is going to spend the manpower that will make the endeavor a net negative.", "I do not believe in unpaid internships unless it is part of a formal curriculum (medical/dental/mental health/etc school)\n\nYou will benefit from the interns work, you owe them compensation.  We as a society are moving away, hopefully, from exploiting people in this manner.  The value of the experience is debatable, so to use it as compensation is wrong.  Tangible contributions always should result in tangible compensation.\n\nIf you are willing to pay, ask internally and see what the rate is.  For my engineering firm we pay $20/hr for interns working on a BS degree.  $25/hr for Master's interns and $30/hr for PhD interns.", "Paying to do an internship things are horrible and that is what this is.

Yes, there are laws regulating college internships which specifically make what you want to do--having them work for your benefit rather than theirs, and including the potential for hire at graduation mean that it'd be unlikely to be ruled an internship under current standards--but surely an organization that provides such an important benefit to society is entitled to break a few laws here and there, right?\n\nYTA, obviously, but that's kind of a prerequisite for a job in finance, so it probably doesn't come as much of a surprise.", "YTA.\n\n> I could use 2-3 interns for statistical work / data cleaning and know it would be a genuine educational opportunity.\n\nThe *point* in unpaid internships is to evaluate new workers to see if they're a good fit for your organization while at least paying lip service to the idea of not completely exploiting them for their labor.\n\nIf you need work done, you don't need interns, you need an employee.", "YTA\n\nI think the concept of unpaid internships are an excuse for companies to save money.

Mine was in replacement of classes, so I ended up spending less time gaining those credits than i would have in class. Since I was paying tuition transportation to the internship was covered by it.
