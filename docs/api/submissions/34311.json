His mother lives 1:30h from us, in a smaller city, and occasionally stays over with us to do some errands. Even though we don\u2019t have the best of the relationships due to some behaviors on her side, I don\u2019t mind her coming over and I am a good host in any situation. \nAt this time, my mom, her boyfriend and my sis came from far for New Years and are staying over, on my husband\u2019s request, for his birthday next week. While we travel my mother also will be caring for our dog, that is a bit sick.\n\nToday his mother texted asking to sleep in our bedroom tomorrow night, while we travel. That was due to our guest bedroom being occupied by my family and she not wanting to be without AC for the night. I didn\u2019t like this idea.\n\nTo me, a bedroom is something extremely personal and private. I find a huge invasion of privacy to share my bed and pillows with people, and also I don\u2019t feel comfortable to let someone else in the privacy of our room. It is important to say that I have issues with sleeping locations and sharing personal space with people. Even took a while for me to be able to sleep with my husband. It is something extremely important to me and my husband is aware of it.\n\nWe had different upbringings and we sometimes have different views on society and social cues.\nHe found no issue to let his mother and her husband, in our room. He doesn\u2019t really care. While, I wouldn\u2019t allow my mom or anyone else sleep in our room unless the circumstances were extreme such as sickness, old age or surgery. This was something really clear in my household.\n\nBefore I really had a conversation with my husband, I asked my mom and she agreed with me, also highlighting that she wouldn\u2019t request that of me. That the marriage bed was something sacred and private. I don\u2019t really see the sacred thing, as I am not religious, but I am 100% on the private.\n\nHis mother has close relatives she stayed over all the time before we moved towns and I don\u2019t see the need to be uncomfortable and invaded because she prefers to sleep with the AC in our house.\n\nMy husband and I talked earlier today and our upbringings clashed. I am aware we have different midsets and but I establish clear boundaries on the things that matter. This was something that mattered to me and he said he couldn\u2019t understand how me felling this invasion really being that big of a deal, as it was only a bed we could strip the sheets later, while my somewhat sour relationship with his mother would make a lot more sense. That if I didn\u2019t give way on this now, in the future if an alike situation happened with his father (whom I have a good relationship), i would have to. I felt this unfair as my key point was the privacy and private thing.\n\nWe agreed to disagree and in the end his mother wont stay over. Was I an asshole for putting my quirk and need for privacy over his mother comfort?", "created_utc": 1704334474, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18y1gkd/aita_for_not_wanting_to_let_my_mil_and_her/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel the same way.  Stay out of my bed, bedroom, personal space etc\u2026.  I cannot believe she even asked.", "NTA. \n\nYour house isn\u2019t a hotel. If your MIL had an emergency and needed AC, I\u2019m sure there were plenty of hotels within driving distance that she could\u2019ve stayed at. \n\nBut mostly- nobody will ever stay in my bedroom or sleep in my bed. That\u2019s a huge violation of privacy. My MIL let my husband\u2019s cousin and her husband sleep in my bed one time when MIL was at our house without us home, and I felt so violated and disrespected. I was not okay with it. In fact- I was livid that it happened and even more mad that MIL didn\u2019t ask if it was okay. It\u2019s one of the things that led to a \u201cMIL isn\u2019t allowed to sleep at our house\u201d rule. \n\nAlso, even if you WERE fine with having someone stay in your bedroom and bed, it wasn\u2019t an appropriate time for it as you already had other visitors staying at your house. Too bad, MIL- guests are already staying there.", "NAH. It\u2019s ok to have this boundary but hopefully you realize that not everyone would consider this an invasion of privacy and those people\u2019s views are just as valid as yours. Whenever my parents went out of town, the overnight babysitter slept in their bed and it wasn\u2019t a problem. My aunt wasn\u2019t comfortable breastfeeding in front of other people so when she came over when my cousins were babies, my mom let her use my parents\u2019 bedroom. I\u2019m not saying to invalidate your feelings. My point is your MIL didn\u2019t do anything wrong by asking and your husband isn\u2019t wrong for not agreeing with you. I\u2019m glad you decided to agree to disagree instead of dragging this out.", "NAH\n\nThis is a situation where it's two yes and one no.\n\nHe is comfortable. Fine. You are not. Also fine. Having said no, he accepted the decision.", "NTA- also I\u2019m confused your family will already be there and your mil also wants to use your house at the same time your family does?", "NTA but also, you don\u2019t have to have identical boundaries for different people. Some people you will be more comfortable around and that\u2019s ok.", "NAH, it's absolutely fine that she asked and absolutely fine that you said no.  It's your house and your rules.  Even if you mil is doing you a favor, it's still your house.  Conversely, what your mil asked isn't unreasonable to many people so it wasn't a problem she asked either, so long as she is accepting and respectful of your answer.", "NTA\n\n> she not wanting to be without AC for the night\n\nWhat a preposterous reason to demand to stay at someone else's house.\n\nShe can purchase (and pay for the operation of) her own air conditioner.", "Do you ever stay in hotels?", "NTA. It\u2019s perfectly fine to not want people staying in your bed or going into your room. Also, why would she want to stay in your home with your family without you or your partner there?? If I were your family, I\u2019d be so uncomfortable.", "NTA\n\nI feel like this answer required a \"two yes's\" to agree and you didn't. As long as it is standard and doesn't change for anyone else asking, it is fine.\n\nThis \"two yes's\" or it doesn't happen is a good communication way when deciding lots of things in your household. Examples: buying a major purchase, moving to a new city, any potential roommates or animals, etc", "Yta", "NTA - If you don\u2019t want someone sleeping in your bed or in your room, then that should be your choice. \n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t mind if someone just slept in my bed, but I don\u2019t want people getting busy in my bed. Everyone has their boundaries and people should respect that.", "NTA it\u2019s your bed you can make the decision, although I also understand her. My family has always left their bed to my grandma when she visits, my mom would take my bed or the couch and grandma her bed.\n\nI remember once my roommate said my friend could sleep in her bed when she was gone. The next day, a guy friend came over and slept in her bed since she wasn\u2019t home still. When he left I cleaned her bed and made it. She asked \u2018how did K enjoy the couch bed\u2019 I was like, he slept in your room I thought it would be fine since M used it the night before. She didn\u2019t want K in her bed and was uncomfortable with it. I felt so awful. I wouldn\u2019t do it again and I can understand its a private place. To me it was as if M had slept 2 nights in a row, to her it was a breach of her privacy. (My roommate knew both friends but didn\u2019t particularly like K and had not told me) \n\nThat to say, you\u2019re allowed to choose who can use your room and when, it doesn\u2019t make you an ah", "NTA.  While I don't feel this same way, I have known many who would agree with you including my husband.", "NTA, I'm weird about my bed too. But you could have moved the AC unit or gotten a cheap one for the room she would be staying in to both protect your bed and your relationship. (If possible/within budget)", "NTA. you can change the sheets, but the fluids that are spilled often run much deeper. amazing SHE would want to sleep in your bed.", "It\u2019s just a bed. So long as you trust that she isn\u2019t going to rummage through your stuff (which I imagine she wouldn\u2019t or else you wouldn\u2019t allow her to be alone in your place) then it\u2019s not a big deal.

Personally, I find it weird for a parent to want to sleep in their adult child's bed that they share with a partner.\n\nMy daughter asked me and my husband to watch her dog while she and her BF go on a vacation. She lives 5 hours from us, so we considered staying at her place to minimize the drive back and forth. She and her BF have a king bed and in the guest room there is a queen. Although, my husband and I are accustomed to a king bed, I wouldn't even consider sleeping in her bed while she was away.", "No judgement without some background.

I know that it isn\u2019t something everyone agrees, which is fine, your bed your choices, but I want to have at least that protection.", "It is nice to find someone who understands what I mean with bedroom privacy. That is basically what my husband explained to his mother, I don\u2019t know what came of it in the end.", "Thank you, I thought about it a lot and I didn\u2019t consider her being wrong for asking. I just feel that a lot comes in while dealing with our relationship as in laws, which she is aware isn\u2019t in a great note. That aside, my issue was more with my husband and the lack of justification for such a request and sacrifice of privacy on my side. \nHe made me feel a little mean for not agreeing to it. If she was sick, or really old or had an extreme situation, I would deal with my feelings on privacy and invasion another day and she would be welcomed over. However, not having AC in her close family side didn\u2019t feel enough to me.", "The reason was kind of my issue. I told my husband for her to take the potent fan we have at home, so she could be more comfortable. I just felt the reason wasn\u2019t enough for me to sacrifice such a personal thing.", "Yes, but I don\u2019t really feel comfortable. I think a few weird things that make me unsafe and out of my comfort zone in hotels. Like, I don\u2019t like to sleep close to the door, I check if it is locked, I have my dog  as near as possible, I need sheets changed every week, mattress and pillows protection covers, among other things. I also don\u2019t use the hotel towel, I always walk around with my own. \nMy mom acts the same way in some things, I think I inherited the habit but expanded way more.

I think my only issue with hosting people is not being certain of the amount of people in a large party for eating and sharing my bed with others.", "NTA This is just a difference in approach that can't be compromised on. I think this would require two yeses, but only one no. \n\nIf they don't really get it I'm afraid they will have to accept it without fully getting it; unless they are really unreasonable they should at least come around to understanding that it isn't personal; you don't reject them, it's just that to you your bed is an inviolable personal space.", "I don\u2019t even share a room with my partner, we\u2019ve been together for years and have a child", "It just seems extra weird that MIL wants to stay in your bed, with your family in the house, without you or your partner there, an hour and a half from her home\u2026 all because she doesn\u2019t want to be without a/c for a bit? Really weird logic, IMO.

His family showing up at lunch, more people for dinner than told, random sleepovers and etc. I can go through it all fine.\nI don\u2019t think she meant in a bad way, it is just something normal in his family. It is just something odd for my upbringing, as we have very clear boundaries in my family. I guess that\u2019s where the clash comes from. My mom would never request that of us, as she knows I wouldn\u2019t do the same from her.", "To me, this hinges on whether this is a pattern or an exception.  If this is a one off, NTA.  If the husband has a long list of unilateral rules to abide by, YTA.", "Sometimes, as have I. I mean, we moved cities 3 times last year due to his health and work ambitions, I really hated it, but I accepted the situation for our relationship. I don\u2019t keep a list of things we do for each other or rules that he has to follow. However, the bed thing is a big deal for me personally, he is aware of it. I don\u2019t mind people sharing the bed with other people, I just don\u2019t want mine shared.", "I fully agree with op. My partner of several years would have zero issues with any of his or my family sleeping in our bed. I however would never go for that. With ocd it just is gross. And from past traumatic incidents that personal safe space is my personal safe space and I\u2019m not sharing it. Hotels are different. How that works in my head other than it\u2019s not my personal bed, and hotels are fine I have zero clue. Also on that note if I sleep at other peoples house give me a sheet and the couch as I\u2019m not comfortable sleeping in someone else personal bed even if they were not there.", "I have offered my bed numerous times. My FIL has stayed in our bed when we are out of town to watch our dogs. This has never been odd to me or my husband. But we still respect the idea. And personally, I\u2019d never ask to stay in someone\u2019s bed. Especially while they were out, but their other family was in the guest room. Also, your family was clearly staying in your home and not in your room\u2026 that should\u2019ve been a signal.", "This is a two person yes situation, but marriage is also a two person yes situation.  NTA, but you can only do so many unilateral decisions in a marriage, what people think on SM will not matter at that point."]}
