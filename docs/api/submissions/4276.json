I'd rather spend that money on the honeymoon or a house. I told her early on that this is how i feel but she pushed for the big wedding and i caved. But now this is happening and i feel like she cares more about the wedding venue than the fact that we're marrying each other and I'm finding it hard to be sympathetic. I mentioned we could have a 2nd wedding down the road maybe but she's completely shutting down about it now.  I'm to the point that i an finding this all stupid and annoying.

Maybe a BBQ at a park near wherever the wedding is ? Would you be able to ask either of your parents for a bit of help ? Could you cut down the guest list a bit ? Would she be willing to forgo an expensive honeymoon and find a cheaper alternative ?  Are you both willing to tighten your budget until the wedding to save up some extra money ? Is fundraising possible ? Where I am from, people hold wedding socials to raise money for a wedding. It is a big party, and you buy tickets to attend. Different people and businesses donate prizes for raffles. And the wedding party donates their time to serve drinks, MC, do decorating and clean up, etc. Also, if you take out a loan, make sure she knows that it is important to you to get it paid off as quickly as possible, and ask her to work with you to figure out your guys budget and ways to make that happen asap.

She said something like \"we can't afford this, we might have to cancel\" to which i agreed. She was very upset and basically shut down for the rest of the conversation.

We may not be able to have the glamorous wedding but we can still surround ourselves with good friends and family and make the best of it. Maybe we can do something bigger in 5 years as a renual or something\" not verbatim but along those lines.

A huge pandemic financial hit, plus the loss of the dream wedding, plus the pressure from her mother. It's a lot! \n\nI think you should tell her her emotions are so valid, and not rush her to come back swinging ans smiling immediately. Let her feel her emotions, even if it's uncomfortable to you.

I love and respect my Husband enough to go with a budget. Did I fall in love with the dress? Yes, yes I did. But the dress and the whole wedding was not more important than who I was marrying and our life AFTER the wedding. I did not want to start our marriage in debt.
