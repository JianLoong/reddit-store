I'd rather spend that money on the honeymoon or a house. I told her early on that this is how i feel but she pushed for the big wedding and i caved. But now this is happening and i feel like she cares more about the wedding venue than the fact that we're marrying each other and I'm finding it hard to be sympathetic. I mentioned we could have a 2nd wedding down the road maybe but she's completely shutting down about it now.  I'm to the point that i an finding this all stupid and annoying.

Maybe a BBQ at a park near wherever the wedding is ? Would you be able to ask either of your parents for a bit of help ? Could you cut down the guest list a bit ? Would she be willing to forgo an expensive honeymoon and find a cheaper alternative ?  Are you both willing to tighten your budget until the wedding to save up some extra money ? Is fundraising possible ? Where I am from, people hold wedding socials to raise money for a wedding. It is a big party, and you buy tickets to attend. Different people and businesses donate prizes for raffles. And the wedding party donates their time to serve drinks, MC, do decorating and clean up, etc. Also, if you take out a loan, make sure she knows that it is important to you to get it paid off as quickly as possible, and ask her to work with you to figure out your guys budget and ways to make that happen asap.

She said something like \"we can't afford this, we might have to cancel\" to which i agreed. She was very upset and basically shut down for the rest of the conversation.

We may not be able to have the glamorous wedding but we can still surround ourselves with good friends and family and make the best of it. Maybe we can do something bigger in 5 years as a renual or something\" not verbatim but along those lines.

If someone wants something super expensive that is past our budget, they were the one responsible for making it happen. For example, you want the pricier cake? You need to come up with the money-and not from our joint funds. And you know what? Both of us ended up working additionally to bring in money to pay for the extra things that mattered enough to make the work worth it. \n\nYou can\u2019t afford her luxury dream, it is not financially feasible and if you take out loans you will both be paying for for the rest of your life.

We both had what we thought was a comfortable savings. \n- This wedding was going to be 50-75 people and we planned to do a lot more ourselves than the venue allowed for like having our friend cater our designing or own decorations.\n- At one point i mentioned the wedding being 50k but that was a bit of an overestimate on my part, it really landed in the 30k range but still WAY out of range. \n- Her mother got involved, insisted on almost 40 more guests, insisted on a lot of expensive changes, and didn't offer any more money than she had origionally offered.\n\nUPDATE:\nWe got a chance to sit down and talk to each other.  She fully understands the severity of the situation, she just needed time to think it through.

One line that stuck out to me was this: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford it and im not interested in doing 50k to impress her snobby family.\u201d In addition to financial concerns, it sounds like there is some lingering resentment towards her family that is potentially being projected onto your fianc\u00e9e.
