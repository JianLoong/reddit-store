She has an art degree and has done some commission in the past but has since given up. She now works an office job. She expressed to me a few months ago that she wanted to get back into it but doesn't know where to start. I'm not exactly in the art world but I do work in performance art and know some people in the art world that I've done work for. I said I'll keep an eye out, see if anyone has anything I can recommend her for. \n\nRobert(M33), another friend of mine, announced a new project he's doing and he's looking for an artist to create a mascot for him. He didn't care about whether the artist is professional or amateur. He just wants something creative and good. So I recommended he give my friend a shot. He agreed to seeing her creation if she wants to give it a try. \n\nSo I brought it up with Tammy and she was excited. She drew up a mascot quickly and submitted it to Robert. He loved it and commissioned her to do a full series of different poses and expressions. Tammy called me squealing and said her thank yous before starting work. \n\nThe next week, she texted me and said Robert was breathing down her neck about the drawings. I asked her what she meant and she said he called her twice in a week asking about the progress of the mascot. She felt like she needed to get it doen yesterday and she didn't appreciate it. I called Robert to ask him about it and he said he was just looking for an update. I relayed that to Tammy and she said \"fine. I'll continue working.\" \n\nTwo weeks later, another friend (who is unrelated to this situation) sent me an email full of screenshots of Tammy blasting me in private DMs about how she hates Robert's mascot idea and how it's pissing her off but because \"my dear friend asked me to, I have to\". And how I was an asshole for accepting a commission for her when I knew she hates cartoony artwork. She talked about how she felt I was blinded by how much I like Robert that I can't see how much she'd suffering under his constant watching of her progress. \n\nWas I wrong to help her get a commission?", "created_utc": 1683458047, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13aks84/aita_for_securing_my_friend_an_art_commission/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Now Tammy is being very rude to you because Robert is being rude to Tammy.  She needs to address the source of her frustration (Robert) and not re-direct it to her friend (you) who was trying to help her.", "NTA, sounds like Tammy can't stand consequences of her own choices. You didn't ask her to do this, you only told her about this opportunity, it's her responsibility to set boundaries with Robert and to set rules of this cooperation, not yours.", "NTA, looks like Tammy is overwhelmed and looking for someone to blame besides herself. You did a nice thing for your friend and I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s biting you in the ass.", "NTA at all, you tried to help Tammy and also Robert by introducing them on a project that could benefit them both.\n\nTammy is showing her true colours and I hope she\u2019s now an ex friend, she\u2019s a snake in the grass. \n\nIf I was you, I\u2019d apologise to Robert for recommending Tammy and advise him to take his business elsewhere", "NTA\n\nYou are a sweetheart to keep your eyes and ears open for your friend when she clearly stated that she wanted to get back into the art world.\n\nTo me it seems like she is very overwhelmed with the pressure of working for someone (and ofc if someone commissions something, they want updates and make changes..). I think she\u2019s just looking for a scapegoat tbh.", "NTA She could have said no.", "NTA\n\nIt's hard to tell if Tammy is being realistic here, but part of running a business is giving clients reasonable turnaround time estimates.  If she only wanted to do one drawing, she should have declined the additional work OR she needs to tell Robert what she can actually do and in what timeframe.\n\nI can't tell if Robert did anything wrong. If he asked for an update, perhaps that's all it was.", "NTA, sure it would have helped if you know what specific kind of commissions Tammy wanted to do, but all you did was recommend a client. If she didn\u2019t want to do it, then she shouldn\u2019t have. In the end, it\u2019s a business transaction between her and Robert, and it\u2019s her responsibility to keep her end of the deal or end things.", "NTA\nYour friend could have turned you down if she wasn't up for it. But you say she was excited to give it a shot and ecstatic when Robert agreed to go ahead with her. \nHowever from that moment you should have no longer had any involvement, any issues are strictly between the two of them as it is a working relationship. Clients can be pushy and want constant feedback on how something is progressing but he's also paying for her time and work. If she has issue, she can take it up with Robert...and vice versa. \n\nGoing forward make it clear you're not gonna be piggy in the middle with this and just leave them to it.\nAnd going off this experience, leave Tammy to source her own opportunities from now on. Though I have doubts she will be able to handle peoples need for updates, changes and occasional conflict on what works.", "NTA \n\n>  how I was an asshole for accepting a commission for her\u2026\n\nYou did no such thing.  You hooked the two of them up.  He offered her the job, SHE accepted it.", "NTA your \u201cfriend\u201d sounds like a pushover.\n\nyou also sound like a great friend, supporting and encouraging your friends hobbies. maybe ring robert and tell him to look elsewhere for his mascot thingy.", "Even though I have this feeling there's more to the story than you're letting on, I'm going with NTA. She wanted you to help, said yes to giving it a shot and seemed happy to get the commission.\n\nHowever, there's the chance she actually feels she was pressured to doing it \"for you\" even though that wasn't your intention. It wouldn't be the first time a miscommunication like that happened.\n\nYou guys need to talk this out. It's stupid if she running around pissed over something you didn't do. You should tell her you were only trying to help and never intended for her to feel pressure. Tell her there will be no hard feelings if she stops working with Robert.", "NTA You provided her with a solid contact in the art world. This commission could lead to some networking and growth for her art business. She lives to complain and burn bridges. Let her enjoy that office job that she probably also complains about.", "NTA. She could easily have said no, you just told Robert to give her a call. \n\nIf she's not mature enough to refuse work on her own, this isn't your fault.", "NTA --- this is now a problem between artist and client and I would step back and not get involved any further.  They are 2 adults in a business transaction.  It will only get messier if you try to referee.", "NTA and drop the artist \"friend\"", "I've done professional art things for difficult customers and I can tell you that it can be *hell*. \n\nThe problem becomes nearly unmanagable really fast if the to customer thinks having eyes and opinions is basically just as good as understanding how to art. It becomes an absolute gauntlet of self-hatred if additionally, the customer does not understand styles and actually wants something outside of the artistic range of the artist.\n\nNTA but you should reach out to your friend, tell her you have heard and that you didn't know it would get this difficult. Her stress levels are probably off the hook, and all you have done so far is basically side with Robert in pressuring her.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"I called Robert to ask him about it\" .. THIS is where you start to be an AH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou learned that Tammy is an unprofessional AH. **NOW you NEED to apologize to robert.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis has hurt your reputation a lot: Whenever you recommend someone, THIER assholery is your responsibility.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When she talked to Robert she could have easily say no to the commission. You\u2019re just the middle man, didn\u2019t make her do anything or accept the job. She did that on her own.", "NTA. She was thrilled you lined that up to begin with so clearly this wasn't your fault. It's not your fault he was asking for updates and frankly not his fault either. He just wanted to see how it was going. In the future, I wouldn't try to help her with that stuff if she treats you like this and honestly I'd reconsider the freindship if she doesn't apologize", "Nta I believe you discovered why your friend is working in an office instead of actively using their degree. They lack professionalism, have a poor communication style, and they are taking this commission way too personally. If your friend didn't want to draw animals or didn't like the styles they should advocate and communicate with THEIR CLIENT, not whine about you in some drama wheel.", "NTA and no good deed goes unpunished as they say. You tried to help a friend and she\u2019s being ridiculous. It was up to Tammy to set the parameters with Robert not you. How bad does she want to work in the art world?", "In this case yes-because your friend is not really your friend", "This post should be removed. Stop posting when you\u2019re obviously NTA, if you need attention go elsewhere.", "NTA.  You weren't wrong to recommend her for the commission.  Everything that happened after was on her.  And needless to say, don't recommend her for another one.  She may be stressed but her implying that you are somehow at fault...real good way to make sure you don't do her any favors in the future.", "NTA\n\nYou did a good thing by trying to support your friend\u2019s art. This sounds like \u201cno good deed will go unpunished.\u201d\n\nYou gave Tammy an opportunity to experience the full range of art by commission, and she\u2019s struggling. Maybe she has was reminded that working with clients and on deadlines is why she chose not to commit to her art full-time. Perhaps she\u2019s figuring out what kind of art she is willing to do. Either way, those are her lessons to learn.\n\nStep away from mediating between Robert and Tammy. This is neither your responsibility nor a reflection on you. You brought two people together; maybe it will work out, and maybe it won\u2019t.\n\nFeel fortunate that your other friend was able to clue you in to Tammy\u2019s thoughts, but resist the urge to confront her until after the job is complete. Otherwise, you may become another \u201creason\u201d why Tammy can\u2019t do the work. (She may have said these things knowing they would get back to you.)\n\nSome people can\u2019t function without complaining about their work. It\u2019s as if having a burden or struggle makes them feel alive (or at least connected to others) in a daily grind. She may have been spouting off to say, \u201cLook at my hectic artist\u2019s life!\u201d\n\nOthers love to twist the narrative publicly to spare themselves inner pain. (Your cousin\u2019s getting married first even though you have been dating longer? \u201cI suppose I\u2019ll have to endure all the fuss by being a part of that, but MY wedding will be bigger or better or less tacky!\u201d)\n\nThe classiest thing to do would be to say nothing and let the chips fall where they may. If she offers you a gift or a thank you when it\u2019s over, accept it with gratitude. If she complains about the experience, say you are sorry it didn\u2019t work out. Make the decision to not try to help her find work again. If she complains about not doing her art, politely change the subject.\n\nYou are a good friend. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nYour friend doesn't want to get back into art. She wants to complain about how her dreams of being an artist were crushed", "NTA but now you know why she gave it up in the past. she cant handle the pressure of being an artist", "Honestly, I didn't know she doesn't like cartoony art. She's shown me her old pieces before and some of them were cartoony. If I knew, I wouldn't have recommended her", "I usually don't butt into other people's projects. I did this once because Tammy sounded very distressed and I wanted to make sure nothing was metaphorically burning to the ground", "If you have any questions, I'm willing to answer them to the best of my ability. I'm not heavily involved with their project. I introduced them and they did most of the correspondence on their own. I only ever really hear about it from Tammy and that one unrelated friend. Robert has been radio silent on the topic. So if the questions are about the project, I may not be much help between not being involved and not wanting to give too much away and accidentally dox my friends.", "That's the problem with recommending amateurs.", "But an apology to robert is in order, because OP had a lack of judgement when he recommended Tammy.", "I've worked with Robert a few times before myself and he's pretty good with accepting no as an answer. I will admit that other than introducing them and hearing about the projecf from Tammy, I am not involved in it at all. They could have had something happen between them that I do not know about. \n\nAll I did after getting Tammy's call is call Robert to ask him if he called Tammy twice during the last week and he said yes, he was looking for updates, see if she needed anything or has any questions, maybe get a look at an early concept drawing. He even said if his calling was interrupting her process, he'll just check in once a week on the same day, same time. She can determine the time.", "Has it been that difficult though? I can't tell from the posting tbh. It could be that Tammy can't cut doing work-for-hire and that's why this project has been hell and probably why she stopped doing commission work in the first place. I have NO issue with that. This is something I've learned about myself as well. The existence of deadlines just kills the joy for me. I just don't think we can tell either way from the information provided if or how Robert is being difficult. All we really know is that he wants more communication from Tammy.\n\nI agree NTA, but it doesn't sound like OP has taken sides as much as try to be the mediator and help bring this project to a close quickly so that everyone is happy. If I were OP, I'd definitely not be doing Tammy any favors in the future. She's talking about her behind her back and skewing the facts for sympathy.", "It just felt like the communication between the two of you has been less clear cut than you say, considering her reaction. Your remark about you liking Robert makes me think she's felt you were pressuring her and that perhaps you did so unconsciously.\n\nRegardless I really think this can be worked out rather easily if you guys just talk. Misinterpreting someone's intentions is a classic. If you make it clear it was never your intention to pressure her this should be over pretty quickly.", "I'm not blaming you, and a lot of this might be pressure interfacing badly with her level of experience / self esteem.\n\nI'm just saying go support your friend.", "No, I mean it would sound to her like OP is taking / would take the side of robert. I don't think OP is really even that involved.\n\nBut I understand how hard art commission can be, especially if you have little experience. She does not have to skew the facts to get my sympathy, or for me to cut her a little slack with how she deals with this experience.", "It seems like you've misunderstood. She mentioned me liking Robert but it's not in the romantic sense. I am engaged to a completely different man. \n\nShe was most likely implying my liking of him as a professional in the field. I don't believe I have pressured her. I called her the night Robert said ok and told her I have someone looking for an artist, would she like to try. She said sure, what the details are, and hung up. \n\nI will talk to her but like other redditors said, i may just have to be 100% hands off or rethink my friendship with Tammy. She's said some deeply hurtful things about me in those DMs. Not 100% sure I can swallow those insults and move past them."]}
