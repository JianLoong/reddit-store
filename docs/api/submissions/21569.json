You told him it was a bad idea. Dad overruled you and said do it anyway. You did what he asked. Dad has to deal with the consequences of his actions. \n\nThere is no way this is your fault - dad is just an idiot who doesn\u2019t have the maturity to take responsibility for his own decisions and is a coward who would rather put the blame for his choices on a teenager.", "It was...a *shit*zu?  \n\nI have waited all my life for this moment.", "NTA, but good you showed her reality. Zoos are inhuman and horrible. They contribute almost nothing and are outdated and useless.

How much more should you have protested? And how? PowerPoint presentation? Interruptive dance?

I have taken a kid on a business trip on their solemn promise not to leave the hotel room for the two hour periods between my returns. They slept, played games on the laptop, and did their summer reading. Then we went to the nice beach or pool, dinner, movie. \n\nI did have my colleague test them at the room door!

They have literally brought animals back from the brink of extinction. They are very humane, are designed with habitats that mimic the natural world, and do incredibly important research to conserve and support endangered species. \n\nBAD zoos like the one OP describes are inhumane and horrible and should be outlawed.

I know he would probably argue that you're going to benefit too if the client likes him and a big deal goes through, but it's his job, not yours.  The client doesn't sound like a gem either, being okay with it.", "NTA.  Your dad is a fucking AH.  I really hope you show him these comments.
