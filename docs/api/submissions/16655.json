You just don\u2019t want small children there.  And that\u2019s fine.  \n\nWhat I would do is talk to your sister about this one on one, and let her know this is the decision you guys want to take this day.  Assure her you love her kids, but you just want this day to go a little smoother for everybody, and that no kids under the age of 10 are coming to this thing.   \n\nNow this is the important part; invite her to be part of the bridal party, but please understand that she might have to decline.  It\u2019s one thing for her to find a sitter for a wedding.  It\u2019s another if she has to find a sitter for the wedding, the rehearsal dinner, the photos, and all that.    \n\nGood luck with all this though.", "NTA i don't get why the childfree wedding thing has become this huge controversy. \n\nYOUNG KIDS DON'T WANT TO GO TO WEDDINGS. Like seriously. I love kids, but having to sit still for hours in uncomfy clothes with no age appropriate entertainment is not an ideal time for a young toddler. Then the parents are either 1) stressed out trying to keep their kid happy and entertained or 2) letting their child run free and get in the way or break things. The kids are not offended, the parents are and I don't understand why. If you are being respectful and understanding that a parent might not be able to leave their child and therefore can't make it, I can't understand why anyone would get angry. \n\nI got married 2 years ago and wanted to do no kids, and caved due to the amount of people throwing a tantrum. My wedding that was only going to be 50 people ended up at around 85. It added significant costs for food, seating, ect. because venues and vendors count children who can walk as a full seat/plate even if they don't need it. So while I got lucky and nothing went wrong, I basically paid a bunch of extra money for a bunch of kids to be there not having a good time. Who does that actually benefit?", "NTA. It's your wedding.\n\nBut your sister is also NTA if she doesn't come.  I would not trust anyone but extremely close family with a 6 month old and it sounds like they will all be at the wedding.", "NTA.\n\n>They\u2019re only response to that is that it\u2019s important to them to not upset my sister and cause this family divide. \n\nYou can be upset though.

Some requests also come with the reality that many may not be able to attend, such as a destination wedding.\n\nKid-free weddings are pretty standard practice and under a certain age or maturity, I can see kids being a distraction. They're going to be bored and they're at an age that they can easily be upset at the littlest things.\n\nThis is a reasonable request and for close family, arrangements can be made to include kids at the reception, but not the alter.", "NAH. It's understandable that your sister might be a little hurt that her children aren't welcome, or to not want to leave her infant especially. It's also understandable for you not to want to chance your wedding being interrupted by children acting like children, and not fair to your other guests to make an exception for your sister you don't make for other guests (though if you did make a \"bridesmaids kids/bride's niblings\" exception, most would understand).  \n\nWould it be possible - or would you be willing - to offer the compromise of a room at the venue with someone she trusts to babysit during the ceremony?", "NTA - I have 4 year olds and completely understand when they\u2019re not welcome at events. They\u2019re like really loud drunks most of the time (but I love those little AHs so much!), and we spend the entire time trying to keep them quiet that we don\u2019t enjoy anything. Your sister would probably really like a date night of fun without the kids. I\u2019d have a nice conversation with her about how much you love your nieces and nephews, but you\u2019d like her to be able to enjoy your wedding (and the no little kids rule) and ask how you can help her be more comfortable with childcare. Expect her to be hurt for a little bit, but hopefully she\u2019ll come around.", "NTA.

You are flatly saying to your sister/family that your day can and will be perfect without them in it, rather than risking to have a baby make a fuss, be shushed and taken out. You \"do not want young children there and that's important to you\", more than having your family there to celebrate with you.

They are very young, she'll be in the bridal party, and she might just want to enjoy the wedding and celebrate.  If I was your sister I'd leave the kids with their paternal grandparents anyway. Just communicate with her.\n\nAlso, it is YOUR wedding, and your reasons are valid.\n\nNTA", "NTA - Totally understand your reasoning behind this decision.   It's a tough one, but I get it.   Your parents need to get behind you on this.   Your sister needs to understand that this is not a little kid event, but if she decides to opt out, respect that.   But I am hoping that her and hubby will find a sitter and come and enjoy your wedding, respecting your wishes.   Good luck!", "NTA it's your wedding, so you can do whatever you want.

I honestly can't believe people would get upset over a 6 month old baby not being there.", "NTA Your wedding your choice. If your parents and sister don't like it that's on them.", "Children that young do not want to sit through a long, boring wedding. Weddings are not child centered or kid friendly. It would be nice to have child care on the premises if possible.", "YTA - so brothers \u201ckids\u201d are ok, but not sisters\u2026. Your parents are right. My wife and her sister have not really talked in almost twelve years after a similar situation at her wedding. If that\u2019s what you want, go for it.", "OK. Here's the thing. You are close enough to your sister that you would like her to be in the bridal party and yet you are OK with a) the possibility of excluding her from the wedding for the sake of having kids POSSIBLY getting upset or fussy during the wedding and b) putting her in the agonising position of having to choose between you and her kids knowing that if she chooses her kids she will have to miss out on a day she would love to be a part of. Her youngest will be six months old - unless you are having a very short wedding there is little chance she will feel comfortable leaving them with anyone outside her immediate family, most of whom will be at your wedding. And c) to compound the exclusion you are allowing your brother's kids. They may be older but inviting them means making his life easier while you simultaneously make hers harder. That's not going to feel good.\nI am going with NAH because it is your wedding your rules, but don't expect people to not be upset. Your parents will be missing a child during family photos (I got excluded from my brother's by a photographer who forgot he had a sister so didn't come and get me for any of the ones with my brothers and that shit hurts every time the pictures come up on their anniversaries so it's not even a one off kind of upset), and knowing she will likely be upset will obviously have an impact on their enjoyment of the day as well, making it a very conflicting feeling for them, so I don't feel like they are out of order for letting you know they are upset about it either. Better to tell you outright than to quietly accept only for you to find out later how they really felt when you no longer had a chance to do anything about it.", "I'm going to be in the minority and say YTA.\n\nYou want your sister to be in your bridal party, but you don't want to put measures in place so that she can come. You have to remember that her youngest will only be 6 months at the wedding, and she will not want to be separated from her for however long the wedding would be.\n\nA reasonable solution would be to allow her to come to the wedding with the kids but have some sort of babysitter or creche during the ceremony itself.\n\nAt the end of the day, it is your wedding and your choice, but be prepared when your sister no longer wants to have a relationship with you for excluding her from your wedding", "I feel like every day we see a story of someone refusing kids at a wedding and then getting upset when parents get bothered lol. \n\nLook it\u2019s your wedding, do what you want. But can you really be shocked when someone points out that some people get to have their kids there and some don\u2019t? I feel like having an arbitrary age cut off is just ASKING for drama. Having a child free wedding is perfectly fine, but you can\u2019t be flabbergasted when parents are upset there\u2019s a double standard. Even if the double standard makes sense, some parents have to pay for sitters and some don\u2019t. Of course that\u2019s going to be irritating. \n\nNTA, but also, just let them be angry.", "What does your sister have to say about it?", "NAH. But maybe you can find a middle ground? like a babysitter to take care of them throughout the party in a space separate from the buffet or further away from the other guests?\nSo they are present, nobody gets upset but they end up not disturbing the bride and groom and other guests because they are being entertained in a different room? of course your sister will have to pay for the costs\nAlso invite to the party but are absent from the ceremony?\n\nBut if you feel that there is no way to reach a middle ground. The wedding is yours so the final word must be yours and the bride's", "NTA. You can certainly have a child free wedding.

They're still learning social cues, and OP and fiance are saying that's great but they doesn't want that for her wedding. And that's okay! \n\nSome people love weddings with kids. Some are amazing and go off without a hitch. But I've also seen LOADS of videos of a child jumping into the back of a Bride's dress as she walks down the aisle, a child pulling the bride backwards after standing on their veil, kids with muddy/cake filled hands touching the bride's dress, kids being rude or having meltdowns during the first dance, or complaining that they're very bored during the ceremony on the bride and groom's wedding video. \n\nAnd I get it, no one cares about the wedding as much as OP and her future husband. No one cares about the seriousness of her ceremony but she DOES. It's a big deal to them, their money, and their day.

I'm glad I don't have your family", "Right?? u/ClamhouseSassman acting like he\u2019s ever going to be in a position where a woman wants to marry him and he\u2019ll have to worry about this. Hilarious.", "But you are also asking her to be in the bridal party which puts her in a challenging position.  You will need to be clear that you will not resent her absence at the wedding, from the party, in the pictures \u2026", "Oh no, mine proposal hath been rejected. Whatever will I do with myself now that this strange man on the internet who I\u2019ve never met says he will not marry me? Oh woe, I am to die as an old maid, forever unlovable because I spoke an opinion on the internet. I will have to join a nunnery and repent my wicked ways.", "Thirty years ago my wedding got taken over. I was made to do things I don\u2019t want. Lucky my wedding didn\u2019t costs thousands of dollars, however I left my reception early. I don\u2019t look back at my wedding at happy memories s\n\nSo I can tell you when you make choices to keep the peace the only person going to be happy is the person you choose to kiss thier ass for to make them happy.", "If the sibling that threw away the relationship because their sibling wanted child free. That\u2019s on them.\n\nBut I can tell you one thing I got married 30 years ago and I was forced for the sake of keeping the piece of doing a lot of things in my wedding I regret now. I wished I would have just eloped or stood my ground.\n\nI don\u2019t have happy memories of my wedding. My family ruined them. So I can tell you from the stand point of keeping the peace the only ones that will be happy if you give in are the ones your kissing their ass to keep happy.\n\n\nLike I said too a lot of child fee wedding the parents have themselves to blame because parents let their toddlers run the show!\n\n\nWhat you may think is adorable the one paying thousands probably don\u2019t.", "I am too old to be a bridzilla. And quite honestly I use to think child free wedding where horrible. \nThen after seeing TikTok\u2019s of wedding ruined because parents don\u2019t parent thier kids I actually understand why brides are setting then boundaries.\n\nI also can understand at $100 or more catering per person no matter what the age I can understand more and more why this is happening.\n\nPlus not counting even a 6 month old counts to the occupation capacity. So who are you choosing . Your 21 year old best friend or your 6 month old cousins baby?", "Lmao!", "Well wrong again there too, Bridezilla", "Do you have anything valuable to add to the conversation? Anything at all?", "Throwing  away the relationship isn\u2019t the only possible consequence.  It\u2019s easy to say \u2018your choice\u2019 but choices need to be considered in context. \nI do wish I had been a little more self-oriented in my own choices, but not to the point of making it hard for people I myself wished to be there to be present. \nThis bride wants the sister in the bridal party but is willing to put childfree first - it\u2019s not as if the parents are forcing the bridal party choice \u2026 so it sounds like a compromise would be the least regretted option.", "I think all of your family dynamics are strange", "Nope. They're honestly taking this whole topic personally. Look how many replies on different comments they have.", "This is true on this case she needs to decide what she wants more. If it\u2019s child free then she needs to accept her sister may not be in the wedding . If she can\u2019t accept that then her only option is allowing the kids.\n\nBut really my point is that everyone saying your throwing a relationship away. If your relationship was that rocky that it permanently damaged it because you want child free. I don\u2019t think it was that strong to begin with.\n\nBut making someone feel bad for how they want thier wedding is wrong. If you ain\u2019t paying for it you don\u2019t get to voice and option.", "YTA. I invite you all to come celebrate this creation of a new family. But please don\u2019t bring any of my family who I fear might take even 1% of the attention away from me, even if it means my own sister won\u2019t go.", "YTA for making a hard limit on her kids and also asking her to be in the wedding party. You can\u2019t have it both ways.", "Each to their own, and whilst it is not clear how close you and your sister are, I wonder if there isnt a simple solution here. Could you hire a childminder or babysitter for a few hours and find a space for the children to be supervised during the ceremony? Could they be involved in the more social aspects like dinner/ cake/ dancing for the first few hours? Come to the dinner/ dancing after for a few hours?\n\nI feel like it is possible for you to find a way around this, if it matters to you that she is there. It probably would be difficult for her to attend if her children arent invited.  If she is excited for you and has talked about the wedding, it could potentially also feel really hurtful for her to hear you have made the decision to exclude her children. I think quite often, in my experience, child free weddings often seem to have exceptions for the children of close family members.  You are, of course,\nentitled to make choices as you want, although not without consequence. Only you know how much of a rift this may cause for your family. It sounds like your parents will find it really hard to have a good time if your sister cannot attend.\n\nEdit: Soft YTA because it doesnt seem like you've tried to think of any solutions or alternatives when you say you want your sister to be in the bridal party whilst acknowledging she has children including a 6 month old child.", "It\u2019s important to your parents not to upset your sister?\nIt\u2019s YOUR wedding.\nYou?

But maybe you\u2019re not as close with your siblings as I am. People make exception for their siblings\u2019 kids all the time. We did and no one cared.", "NTA.  A no kid wedding is super common. Sister can be reasonable or not. But kids at weddings are the worst.", "NTA. \nIt\u2019s your choice, and your parents have no say in it. \n\nYour sister may be ok with it, having a child free day, but be prepared for any fallout if she isn\u2019t.", "No. It's your wedding and in this instance I agree, weddings are usually adult affairs except for the ring bearer or flower girl and it should be understood that after the ceremony, they will have an area they will be allowed to be children in. I know it's tricky because it's family or you can offer to pay for the babysitter.", "INFO: can your sister reasonably attend? Is there someone able to care for the kids who isn't also at the wedding? Are the kids capable of being left that long with a babysitter who won't be at the wedding?", "I get so annoyed at people that think the world should revolve around people with children.  OPs sister has three children under the age of five.  There\u2019s no way they will be able to ride herd on all three of them all day by themselves.  That likely means at least one of the other guests helping out, probably the OPs mother, who then cannot fully enjoy her childless daughter\u2019s wedding, nor pay that daughter the attention she deserves in her wedding day.\n\nNow multiply this by however many other parents of young children would bring the fruit of their loins.  It\u2019s a wedding, not a kindergarten.\n\nAlthough I might not be the best person to ask as if I were ever to marry I\u2019d have a guest free wedding with just myself, my other half and any required witnesses.", "Maybe sister would like a kid free day to enjoy herself. She, or you, needs to find a babysitter.", "That\u2019s the thing. It\u2019s not just about that day. It\u2019s the drama they comes with decision. And it can be drama that can alter relationships, depending on family dynamics. It\u2019s their wedding, they can of course do what they want. But in the end the distraction of  all the family drama, might be way worse than a few  crying babies. I would love to know what the sister\u2019s reaction is to hearing her sister wanting her as a MOH but that her kids aren\u2019t welcomed", "Omg, young kids? PEOPLE don\u2019t want to go to weddings, and it\u2019s because of attitudes like OPs.", "I agree with this. Especially because brothers kids are coming/invited. Even if they are 13 or older, I am sure she feels like only her children are being targeted. Siblings children should be a bit different than a friend\u2019s child etc. maybe find a small way to include them, even if they are not included in the majority. Also, all of the family that might babysit would obviously be going to the wedding so that also might make it more difficult.", "Thank you!!!
