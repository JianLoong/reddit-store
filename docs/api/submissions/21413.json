Before I even go into the issue at hand, I will say he asked for the opening of our marriage and the normal thing happened. He had a string of partners, nothing really steady. I had the same partner for 2 years and they actually became good friends until we got divorced. After a long dry spell he had, he asked for the divorce after giving me the ultimatum of drop my partner or we separate. I chose to separate because my partner treated me better than my husband.

I moved in with my partner and we've been pretty well of since. We share custody of our daughter one week on one week off and we have a rotating pick up schedule from daycare. After I moved in with my partner, he proposed to me that for mental health reasons if I do not want to work I don't have to. I have passive income from military compensation so any money I get outside the house is just extra. So I took his suggestion. I haven't had a job since January of this year and all I do is take care of the house. I clean, mind the veggie garden, run errands, etc. He's been content with our arrangement and so have I.

He snuck in asking when I was planning on going back to work and I answered him honestly saying with partner getting a promotion which came with a raise, I probably wouldn't be unless I really had to.

According to our divorce decree we are both required to pay for 26 weeks of daycare throughout the year. So that means we are paying literally half and half.

Going there every other week could be confusing to her and make it difficult for her to adjust on days that she is there. Being home for a week and then having to go back and follow rules and interact with other children would be hard to balance for that age. I can't see the daycare agreeing to that and if they did they would likely end up asking to be more consistent if she has trouble adjusting.", "It would be very hard to find a daycare that does that. In my area you lose your spot in a daycare if you go from 5 days a week to 3.", "The only way I think they would allow it is if you had someone else on the opposite week needing daycare to take the spot. They most likely won't do the search for you and you'd also be needing to go back to paying full time if the other child is pulled out.", "NTA \n\nI was a SAHM and I learned the thing kids thrive on is consistency. Since you share custody and your daughter would need to be in full daycare when your ex is at work it makes sense to keep it consistent across your scheduled time.  She will be ensured of the same environment and schedule during the day. That will leave you free from chores to enjoy the rest of the day with your family.", "NTA. \n\nTBH, most daycares won't allow you to go part time, because so few ask for it, and that means a slot is taken up by someone paying half-price. Ratios are tight in day cares, so they don't have a ton of wiggle room.\n\nAlso, if the child is happy and is getting the socialization they crave, there's no reason to remove them from it. After all, you would be taking care of a house while trying to keep a child happy, while a daycare's ONE JOB is keeping that kid content and safe. \n\nThe aggression is likely coming from him losing out on the low rent. Hell, even when my husband and I were given first rights to purchase our place, it felt like a punch in the gut.

And ofc you'll be more relaxed and better able to take care of daughter before/after daycare, versus if you were caring for daughter all day while also doing your chores and other tasks/activities.  Daycare lets you focus on other things while your daughter is occupied, meaning you can focus on daughter when she's home.  She's getting the best of both worlds, daycare and quality time at home.\n\nStop doing financial favors for your ex.  Charge him market rent if you keep renting; if you sell to him, sell at market.

Sorry:\n\nI am in U.S. and in my area generally preschool is taught by accredited teachers (like u/AllRightNoWrong) and free preschool for four year olds is provided by the state if you sign up in time. There is a public school in town that offers preschool (both a four year old and three year old programs), and something called headstart which I don't know quite as much about. My understanding is headstart is for kindergarten age kids who aren't quite ready for kindergarten. There are also many private preschool options. My guess is our free four year old preschool is like your 4k option (I had never heard of 4k until today). \n\nThe preschool program, like kindergarten, is based on child's age by start of September 1st and most kids in class will be within that age range. Your child must be potty trained before going to preschool. Preschool is typically only half day (although I think that may be changing) and usually not everyday of the week. \n\nThen there is daycare which is sometimes called \"school\" and some of the nicer ones have accredited, 4 year schooled teachers, but it's not a requirement. Often daycares still try to incorporate learning and academics but curriculum is not as regulated. Often all staff that work at nicer daycares are refered to as teachers even if they don't have that four year accreditation. Daycare ages will vary based on facility, but could be anywhere from maybe newborn to 12 yrs, but often kids will be grouped at bigger facilities based on age/developmental milestones. Aka the 2 year old room, the preschool age room (3-4 yrs) etc. \n\nDaycare is all day or however long the parent needs and is 5-6 days a week or again, however long the parent needs.

I was nodding along picturing her daughter gardening alongside her and enjoying the time with her mom home, so I was also a bit stunned when I read that she\u2019s still sending her to daycare. Some of the comments here are weird to me too. Kids can absolutely still learn and socialize without ever going to daycare.

You better be a fucking gold star parent.", "The daycare is paid for whether the child goes or not. Daycares don't allow alternating weeks. So if she doesn't send the kid to daycare, she no longer has to pay her part. The dad gets stuck with paying a full time daycare for only half the time.

The child will be of school age in 2 years. Are you going to call her lazy then for sending her child to school for 8 hours? \n\nAlso even if she wanted to keep the child, the day care wouldn't allow 1 week on 1 week off stay.

You should never have reproduced.", "YTA.\n\nWhy even bother nabbing 50/50 custody if you're not going to spend more time with your kid?\n\nKids benefit from playdates/socialization, and some people are forced to use daycare fulltime. But choosing to send your kid to daycare 5 days/week is frankly just lazy parenting. I'd understand 1 or 2 days a week, but you're wasting hours of important dedicated artistic/grammar/reading/math skills, as well as bonding during a turbulent divorce, in which children particularly don't do well with in the first place.\n\nYou could be giving your child 1-on-1 learning instruction that will make all of their future schooling an easier to digest, but you have errands and stuff to handle I guess.", "YTA. Why did you even have children with this weird polyamorous shit. \n\nNONE of your attempts at excuses make sense.\n\nOH you can play house, garden and shit but no \"bandwith\" WTF does that mean you're not even working. \n\nShameful expecting others to raise her. Is it REALLY that much trouble to raise your own kid. After all you managed to juggle multiple men. \n\n But of course, you'll get all the typical anti-man pats on the back.", "ESH. You both sound self-centered and exhausting. The poor kid.", "Absolutely YTA. Not working and still dumping your choked at day care because you can\u2019t be bothered taking care of her yourself. Shame on you", "This, and I\u2019ll also add that KEEPING your daughter in daycare will help with her stability, because she isn\u2019t suddenly spending disproportionate amounts of time with you over him, in fact you both see your daughter the same amount.

It failed when he didn't find better and then failed when she did and he \"lost\" her to another,and better man than him.\n\nSo now he is doing everything he can to stay in her life more than necessary to make her miserable too.\n\nNTA OP, and good on you for finding someone who loves you and wants what's best for you. Be civil with co parenting but don't go out of your way to make his life better, put the house on the market and if he wants it he can buy it at market value. \n\nAs for the childcare issue, if he brings it up again say \"sure, let's go back to court to get the child support adjusted since I will have daughter almost full time\" I guarantee you he won't because it will most likely cost him more in child support than what he is paying for in daycare. Also as a mum myself, kids need daycare any way for social interactions with peers, to heading off separation anxiety when they are older and starting normal schooling just to name two reasons.", "This! There's a controlling and selfish aspect I'm feeling from him. I'm so happy for OP!", "Not to mention the 2 full weeks the child is with the dad per month", "Holy smokes!  A reality check.

I miss him like crazy  and spend as much time as I can with him when it\u2019s his week, so yea I will judge her.

A very young child like an infant, I might keep home but keep the schedule like at daycare so they don\u2019t have to adjust every week. But if they\u2019re at least 2, I\u2019d send them. I probably wouldn\u2019t use any extended day like before/after school hours if you don\u2019t need that. \n\nif they are old enough that during some of the day they have lessons or learning time, they should attend that bare minimum so they aren\u2019t frustrated if they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on when they do attend.", "Research on this topic has mixed results, so likely the quality of the program comes into play. However one thing that is for sure good for kids is routine and structure.

Your head is really going to spin when she puts her in kindergarten.", "I\u2019m sorry :( any kind of daycare situations have gotten insane since I was a kid in the super early 2000s. I think the program was put on by two or three ladies of a local church to help single parent/low income families and there was just a small fee to help pay for food and arts and crafts but things are so expensive now it just doesn\u2019t seem possible anymore.
