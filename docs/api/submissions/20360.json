While it's important to respect elders, it doesn't mean that they have the right to demean and belittle others. You stood up for yourself and defended your aunt, which is commendable.\n\nThe fact that Linda's own daughter is no-contact with her suggests that her behavior goes beyond just being \"old-fashioned.\" It's not fair for others to dismiss her actions by attributing them solely to her age. Respect should be a two-way street, and it's reasonable to expect that Linda treats others with respect as well.\n\nWhile it's regrettable that bringing up Linda's strained relationship with her daughter may have been hurtful, it's important to remember that you were provoked and reacted emotionally in the heat of the moment. It might be worth discussing the situation calmly with your parents and finding ways to address the ongoing issue with Linda as a family.\n\nSeeking neutral perspectives is a good way to gain insight into the situation, but ultimately, trust your own judgment and continue to stand up against unfair treatment.", "She's an adult. She doesn't get a free pass to be rude because she's old. She's old enough to know better and everybody telling you otherwise is ridiculous. Would they accept racism from her? Homophobia?
