Respect should be a two-way street, and it's reasonable to expect that Linda treats others with respect as well.\n\nWhile it's regrettable that bringing up Linda's strained relationship with her daughter may have been hurtful, it's important to remember that you were provoked and reacted emotionally in the heat of the moment.

It is not my job to help someone stay ignorant. And no matter what time anyone is from manners were taught, especially back then, why don't they have those. Why is everyone ok with them not having the manners from then but sharing the hate?\" The only way to have been from another time is to have lived through all the others. No one I know has the ability to be born in the 50s or 60s and then just not exist for years before they pop back in modern society with old world views.", ">my own great aunt-in-law\n\nThis is not a thing that applies here. Your aunt's husband's mother is not related to you. An in law is someone you become related to through your own marriage or if your siblings marry someone, their spouse becomes a BIL or SIL. \n\nYou can call her a shirt tail relative if you want but why is this woman even with you all so much? I bet the answer is alienated everyone else. You aren't picking on her. It's not that she is old. It's because she's an asshole and if she doesn't want reality pointed out to her, she needs to leave your aunt alone and leave you alone.

NTA.", "The \"from a different time\" argument is bullshit because she is currently alive in 2023 so she is actually from this time and is just an old sexist AH. Just tell that to anyone coming at you. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I come from an extremely matriarchal family and even the oldest generation would have put Linda in her place the first time she said something.", "Nta you were not picking on her, you were stating facts and I\u2019m personally tired of people excusing behavior based on age.", "Old is not a free pass for toxic. NTA.", "NTA great aunt needs to stop fucking around if she doesn\u2019t want to find out :(", "nta", "Respect is not attached to age. Respect is respect. Give it and get it in return.

I had never thought of it that way.\u201d She also said a girl who got married in our church who had a black bridesmaid was entitled to do what she wanted at her wedding. That she knew times had changed and that was good.", "Unless OP is married, they too have never met their great-aunt-in-law. Linda is OP's Uncle's aunt.

She knew lost my mum young and she wanted to make sure I had the knowledge my mum would have wanted me to know (I was planning on quoting to follow and move in with my BF who was military at the time) and she told me that while she isn't my mother and can't tell me not to be reckless but to make sure I could look after myself if we split.\n\n13yrs later and we are married with three kids (I changed my name to match my kids and no education tied to my maiden name) and I STILL have my own bank account, we have a joint one for instant transfer of money but all my finances come and go from my own personal account. Yes I am a SAHM/Homemaker but it was the path I have chosen for myself (my eldest is the same age I was when I lost my mum and I want to spend as much time with my kids as possible and luckily hubby's career allows me to do it).\n\nOP, NTA, Emily, and Jeff have made their own decisions in what's right for them, good on you for having their backs when they weren't around to defend themselves (not that they need too). It sounds like Aunt Linda needed to hear some home truth, but I doubt she will do the self reflection required to learn from it.", "I think some people use their age as an excuse to say/do what they want regardless of who they might hurt.", "That she knew times had changed and that was good.", "You should be embarrassed if you ever become a woman who won\u2019t change with the times.", " I have no doubt that her daughter stopped talking to her because of that.", "You're just enabling them to keep being assholes.", "It could be up to 70\u2019s or above. We don\u2019t know how old OP is or how old their aunt is. Or any of the ages of anyone here.", "Ohh you\u2019re right. I mistakenly thought the aunt married into the family.", "I must have missed that part. That changes it completely. Thanks. NTA.", "So tired of the generational hatefulness. You\u2019ve really only just called out your own generation here, and added to the stereotype of hatefulness.", "No one I know has the ability to be born in the 50s or 60s and then just not exist for years before they pop back in modern society with old world views.", "That she knew times had changed and that was good.", "It could be, but since OP notes that trying (or not, in this case) for kids is a relevant factor fair assumption to say they\u2019re 30 +\\- 5 years. The attitude of the great aunt would generally be correlated with having kids younger rather than older, so add 20/25 years.

That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about.", "Can I sign up for that class too please. \n\nSeriously, though self-defense (fight to flee) should be taught to all teenage girls before finishing high school, and entering the legal age to drink, they should also be taught how to protect themselves from drunk spiking, I know it wouldn't solve those problems entirely but I hope it would help reduce the number of cases by helping \"women in training\" learn to watch their surroundings better.", "I\u2019m not holding a stereotype. I\u2019m pointing out when she was (likely) born.
