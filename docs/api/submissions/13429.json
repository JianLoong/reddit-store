They sat down at the end of the bar and ordered a few rounds of drinks over the next little while and were pleasant. \n\nLater in the night we got pretty slammed so one of the girls had to come up to me at the other end of the bar to put in another drink order, and when she did she asked if there was any chance of getting those free drinks now. I said it was still a no, but told her there was a mispour that she could have if she wanted it. (The other bartender messed up and made a drink the customer didn\u2019t want, so it was up for grabs.) She said sure thanks and took it with her while I made the rest of the drinks she ordered.\n\nWhen I brought the drink order over to the group, the other 5 girls were all suddenly very icy with me and didn\u2019t really warm back up to me for the rest of the night. Since everything was fine up until that point and since the girl who got the mispour was still perfectly pleasant, obviously they were upset because I only gave her a \u201cfree drink\u201d when they had all been wanting one. I feel like one girl was just in the right place at the right time but the other 5 probably feel like I was playing favorites.\n\nI mostly forgot about it but then as I said, last night one of the girls came into the bar again and was giving me dirty looks which then got everyone talking about what happened, and now we\u2019re all kind of debating whether I fucked up or not so I figured I\u2019d ask here.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1680035704, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1251emg/aita_for_only_offering_one_girl_out_of_a_group_a/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Those girls are clearly just entitled and I\u2019m surprised your co-workers are even debating whether or not you messed up. Imo they are the AH. Don\u2019t go to a bar with the assumption that you deserve free drinks from the bartender lol.", "NTA, they were super childish. They for sure believed on some level they would get free drinks which is as delusional as it is entitled.", "NTA. I bartended in the US and Dublin. A mispour is a happy mistake. We never gave out free rounds to a group of girls asking for free drinks. They sound annoying and pathetic AF. Industry practice at all of the bars I worked at was to buy every 3rd or 4th round for big tippers.\n\nEdit: She complained in an attempt to get free drinks and get you in trouble.", "NTA\n\nYou didnt give them a free drink but a mispour.", "Ofc NTA\n\nShe probably played it off to her friends that she got a free drink, not that it was a mispour.\n\nIf they come back in and complain, that's all you have to say. \"I didn't give her a free drink, it was a mispour from a different bartender. Anyone could've taken it.\"", "NTA. They\u2019re acting like children. Good on you for not letting a drink go to waste.", "NTA. They were acting entitled and weird. I hated when people acted like that when I worked customer service. Like no, dude. I'm not about to steal from my job for you and risk losing it. \ud83d\ude44", "I had no idea people did this. Just walk up to the bar and ask for free drinks?? Pretty life really is different lol NTA", "I do think it was a bad move to give away any drink, especially if these girls had asked TWICE about gettin free drinks. That is all they cared about.", "NTA.  \n\n\nYou didn't single her out or play favorites, it was, as you say, right time/right place/right situation.  \n\n\nIt's interesting that the one girl didn't explain this to her friends.  Or, that they were not understanding the situation.  It sounds as if they were either purposely being offended over nothing, or that they somehow weren't bright enough to figure out the whole miss pour thing.", "NTA - these girls are not entitled to free drinks just because they asked, ffs. Their spoiled entitlement is not your problem. But maybe refrain from doing any \u201cgood deeds\u201d and giving out mispours in the future?", "NTA\nEveryone at the bar wants free drinks. She was the one who came to order drinks for everyone. Right time, right place. \n\nToo bad for everyone else who was in the bar. It\u2019s not about the group, it\u2019s about the entire bar.", "NTA. She could have shared the drink.", "NTA\n\nBartenders do this all the time if there is a miss pour and the table didn't want it, I would probably avoid giving to them group going forward though.", "NTA. My ex tended bar for years and said never give out freebies to those who ask - they're already feel entitled. \n\nNext time, give the mispour to a regular.", "Oy people can be pathetically weird.\nNTA.", "NTA. Those girls weren't entitled to a thing for free. And just because one of them got a mispour means maybe they should walk their butts up to get the next round next time. Snooze you loose.", "NTA and LOL. I find it ridiculous that they got that upset over not getting a free drink and it's even more ridiculous that one went back into the bar at a later day to complain about it.", "I would say NTA it was a messed up order that was going to sit there. I can see how it looks wrong from their perspective. It\u2019s not like you messed it up either.", "NTA. It\u2019s always awesome to get a free drink when you\u2019re out, but it should never be expected. Those ladies were being extremely entitled expecting to all get free drinks.", "NTA. They shouldn't have expected free drinks. They shouldn't be salty about it.\n\nYou probably shouldn't have given the chick the mispour but you didn't think it would be a big deal (and it shouldn't have been). The girl who got the free drink was just in the right place at the right time. Don't let their saltiness get to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
