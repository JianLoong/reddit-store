Of the 11, all were single births. And the largest gap is 2 years.  Upon having my mom at age 40 my Grandma demanded a hysterectomy. She was DONE.

They were just broke paying for trade school for the first 8, college for the 9th, and trade school for 10th.  My mom was the only one to not get a higher education, but she ran away from home, got arrested for drugs, dropped out of HS upon turning 18 and was pregnant with me at 19.  I was raised by my grandma from age 12 on. For a Catholic she was very liberal and ensured that I unlike my mom graduated with honors and went on to college. she understood that what was necessary in her youth was absolutely not necessary in mine.

The fact that you think this is all okay proves they've been shitty \"parents\" from the start.  Why have kids if you can't or don't want to take care of them.
