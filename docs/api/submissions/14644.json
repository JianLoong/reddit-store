I mean even if it\u2019s once a week or two for a couple hours is better than 15 hours a week!", "A 7 year old? That\u2019s still a baby herself! Poor kid.", "How can the youngest be responsible for her younger siblings?\ud83e\udd14", "Well that and beingvraped by their brother.", "Eh, my grandmother, the eldest, was in charge of all the younger ones while her mom was in charge of the family farm (dad was a revenuer/shopkeeper) from the age of 10. She \"escaped\" into a marriage and 4 kids at 18. She said once that she hadn't had a break from cooking 3 meals a day once in 60 years :/ Poverty is a monster, and i don't think a single one of my female predecessors of the early 20th did not work outside the house (farm supervisor, canning factory, men's suit factory, typist...), most for pennies. But at least my grandmother's mom had the excuse of not having access to birth control.", "Does it count that you stole my comment about them being a comment stealer? ;)", "Just in case they do see the post but don\u2019t understand the upvotes indicate agreement, I would loudly like to voice my agreement that OPS PARENTS ARE EXTREMELY SHITTY PARENTS", "Please don\u2019t joke like that", "Self-ctrl-alt-deletion is against rule cinco, the rule enforcers are pretty strict about it.", "Glad someone else had that thought too. I was getting major fundie vibes from this whole situation", "They go through her phone and control how much screen time she has at 17 definitely seems very controlling at the least.", "No, my family isn\u2019t mixed. When I leave for college my next oldest siblings will be 13, 11, and 9 and my parents hope together they can watch 6 kids (I doubt it, they\u2019ll most likely hire sitters)", "1000$ an hour for anything after 9pm.", "I think that was pretty average. Every once in a while, I\u2019d be babysitting for 5-6 hours for a couple to have a night out, but that was like, the max and they were super upfront about what they were doing, where they were going to be and how to get ahold of them, so I walked in with very clear expectations for how long I\u2019d be there.  \n\nAnd that was with two kids, max!", "They\u2019re probably planning to get a hotel room after dinner or something.", "Yes, last time we were all together, my daughter invited her to come on the tire swing but she had to push her little brother and the poor thing looked ready to cry.  I managed to push all the swings so she could have a break.", "Because I'm dumb and typo'd.", "Was just going to type this.", "Unlimited phone usage which will go under random search.", "Ask your friend if the sleepover can be permanent.

Again, best wishes", "Works for me!\ud83d\ude18", "The 12yo will be the new babysitter.", "You are making an assumption that she will be allowed to go to college ... I would not bet on that.", "Lmao. I am just in awe at this poor kid's life, so I appreciate you finding the silver lining for her.", "I don't agree with 'em either but this place can be ban-happy so just an FYI", "Did you forget the name of this sub??"]}
