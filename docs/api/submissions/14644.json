Huge NTA. They were the ones who chose to have 10 kids, not you.", "NTA.  You didn't lie; You just told them you'd get back to them and later told them you had plans. You never told them when you made the plans, They found that out by snooping... So good enough for them, I hope they are disappointed that's what they get for snooping.  You should be able to enjoy your youth and not be saddled with providing childcare. If you have nine siblings under the age of 12 then I have to wonder what on Earth your mother should expect. If she wants \"much needed time off\", then how about maybe not having nine kids in 10 or 11 years? That's not your problem. Sheesh.", "NTA. You did not decide to have 10!!! kids. Your parents should hire a babysitter if they want alone time and not expect you to do it. \n\nBesides, alone time will probably lead to another sibling.\n\nEdit: I just realized it said babysitters, not just one babysitter. They have to hire at least two people to watch over that many kids, but just expect you to do it by yourself, they seem pretty selfish.", "NTA. Seems like too much \"alone time\" is what got them into their current situation, lol.\n\nYou help ALL THE TIME. If what they're asking of you is cutting into your much needed free time then that's a huge issue. \n\nOut of curiosity, how much do they pay you for watching 9 siblings?", "I'm disappointed in your grown parents that they produced so many kids they think they can pawn off on the oldest. It is good that they pay you to babysit. And yet the freedom you have earned and deserve allows you to choose, with full liscense to say yes or no when they ask. That's basic. I hope they don't come down too hard on you? You sound like a great 17-year-old kid with a good head on their shoulders. And if they decide to battle or punish you about this? Feel free to resign completely from babysitting. Get a job at a pizza place. Not your kids. NTA", "I think they've had too much time alone to have that many kids.  NTA its not your job to take care of the kids.  They asked, and you didnt want to, but knew saying so would not make any difference to them.", "sounds like they're getting plenty of alone time if your mom's spent 3/4 of the last 12 years pregnant lmao", "NTA, but they sure are.  You should not be forced to this extreme to avoid spending your entire life babysitting an entire basketball team worth of kids because your parents decided to repopulate the earth all on their own.  You may be willing to help, but it's wrong to put this on you continually--you have a right to your own childhood and should not have to be the family nanny.  Now, let's talk about the fact that they are reading your phone without permission...\n\nI really hope you are making plans to be out on your own as soon as possible because this situation is not healthy.", "NTA Your parents aren't the only ones who need a break. You do too. You're a kid too. You didn't decide to have nine kids. They did. Now they need to own up to it and hire sitters and let you have your childhood back.", "NTA. Get yourself your own job. Sounds like it would be a lot less work than your existing part time \"job\" \n\nAt your age, I spent as little time at home as I could.", "NTA your parents expecting you to babysit for 9 hours for a date night is ridiculous! They decided to have that many kids and are responsible for them. They could have asked for a couple of hours for dinner or movie date which would be far more reasonable. Also a prick move to go through your phone as well \n\nA big conversation needs to happen about what you are happy and willing to do in regards of babysitting especially as you have school work etc to do. Your parents need to work out their own childcare needs and not just assume you can do it. You need breaks too", "NTA - Do your parents not believe in birth control, I'm amazed that they've had 9 kids in the last 12 years.\n\nHow much are they paying you?", "NTA. They are responsible for the many children they chose to have.", "NTA\n\nWhy did they get mad that you lied when if you told them the truth they wouldn't listen? What were you supposed to do? You're stuck just sacrificing your precious youth for them? It's your choice whether you want to babysit their kids or not.\n\nTell them you won't lie in the future, but you wanna be able to refuse them. You're still young and shouldn't be shackled with their responsibilities. That you feel burned out and would rather they hire someone most times, unless an emergency.", "Wait they needed much needed alone time? WHY?! So you can have another child to babysit? If they can\u2019t handle taking care of the ones they\u2019ve already made it doesn\u2019t seem like they should have had so many.

THEY chose to have that many children than THEY get to deal with the responsibility of taking care of them. You are not their built in babysitter. You are a child yourself & need time to be one. You tried to speak to them several times & they aren\u2019t listening. They also don\u2019t need 5-2AM off that\u2019s absurd. They are taking advantage of your kindness.", "NTA they're putting for, far too much on you", "Nta while their was deception on your end they have to understand you need time with your siblings as well. All your free time should not go to child care of kids you did not bring into the world.", "You are not the AH. It's great that you are willing to help and even better that they pay you (I know a few that expect the older sibling to babysit gratis). However, you are allowed time to yourself as well. If they aren't listening when you ask for this, there is little you can do aside from going behind their backs. Though I don't recommend it as an overall strategy. \n\nPerhaps you can negotiate a deal with a set number of hours you are available to babysit a month? I hope you find the balance you need.", "13-15 hours a week? For 9 kids? Ahahaha. What\u2019s the pay rate for that?   \n\n\nI would go back and say \u201cI need to be able to have my youth. I understand there\u2019s a need for help here, but I need time off too. I will baby sit ONCE a week, and a maximum of six hours. Unless it\u2019s an obvious, hospital level emergency, I will need a few days notice, and it needs to not clash with other plans I have. I plan to move out in a year so it\u2019s time for you to start fostering relationships with babysitters who can look after this over sized family anyway. I plan to start working a part time job and saving the money, and that means I won\u2019t be around after school reliably to watch everyone. I understand when I am home I\u2019m expected to be part of hte family and that includes general oversight of my siblings, but I will count it as my once a week babysitting if you leave me alone with them for more than 20mins and go out. I need to start acting like an adult and this includes having healthy boundaries in my life, learning how to safely prioritise things for myself and getting a job.\u201d   \n\n\nThen get a job, start banking your pay big time so it\u2019s there for you as a cash amount to start living ANYWHERE else in a year.", "NTA. Your a kid and being a caretaker to your own siblings should never be your responsibility.", "Quick question, did you birth any of those kids?\n\nNo?\n\nThen why is your parents pawning their kids off on you because they want to make baby #11? \n\nNTA. They can have alone time when the other kids can take care of themselves.", "NTA- You are doing a wonderful job as a daughter and a sibling, it's extremely unrealistic for them to expect you to babysit the amount that you are even after communicating that you felt it was to much. The fact they got angry at you for this is not okay. \n\nI'd recommend you sit them both down and tell them why this happened and that you felt extremely pressured even after telling them your feelings. Communicating healthy boundaries can be hard with your parents but it's needed.", "NTA - you are 17.  They need to arrange child care and take responsibility for having this many kids.\n\nI\u2019m 32 and you\u2019re definitely more responsible than me.", "NTA\n\nYou told them you\u2019d have to get back to them, made plans, then told them you had plans. You didn\u2019t lie.\n\nYour life at 17 shouldn\u2019t revolve around babysitting your nine siblings.", "NTA - your parents are taking advantage of you and then giving you guilt trips because you want to do something with your friends. That\u2019s not fair. You\u2019re young and this is your carefree age where you should be having fun with your friends. Go enjoy your time with your friends. \n\nI hope for your sake they\u2019re not planning to go to a hotel and make another kid for you to watch on their \u201cmuch needed alone time\u201d.  That usually code talk and what parents used to say when I was a kid for sex.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your job to be the parent and be constantly caring for your siblings. Your parents popped out a bunch of kids they can\u2019t afford a real baby sitter for. It was their choice not yours. You\u2019re a kid not a third parent! You deserve a life of your own not just to be a slave for two people who really needed to utilize some birth control.", "Drive it home you had to be sneaky to have some me time, you did not do it in to be a jerk. You have a right to have your own quality time. It sucks they do not see that.", "NTA, and the absolute last thing your parents need is more alone time.", "ESH.
