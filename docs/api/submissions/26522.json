{"id": 26522, "submission_id": "16e4sds", "title": "AITA for joking about my husband in front of our work colleagues after he refused to socialize?", "selftext": "About a month ago, I (F38) was promoted to a higher position at my job. I am now in a more senior position than my husband (M41) at work. My husband has always told me how happy he was that I got the promotion. But sometimes I get the feeling that he\u2019s embarrassed that I\u2019m technically his superior now.\r\n\nLast night, we had a work-related social event. It was supposed to be an opportunity to build team cohesion and that sort of thing. My husband didn\u2019t really want to go (he\u2019s pretty introverted), he also said he had a migraine and didn\u2019t want to make it worse.\r\n\nI told him that it would be weird if he didn\u2019t come, and people might think that he\u2019s jealous of me getting the promotion. After some more persuasion, I was able to convince him to come along. When we got there, he greeted a few people but ended up spending most of the time sitting in a corner on his own and only chatting with a few people at a time.\r\n\nAside from that, the event was pretty good, and most of our co-workers were present. At some point, I was in a large group when (Sarah F46), who had not yet seen my husband there, asked where he was and jokingly asked if he was as serious and mysterious at home as he was at work.\r\n\nI told them he was the complete opposite at home. I said that while at work he seems organized, at home he\u2019s a bit of a slob. I joked about how he always leaves his laundry all over the floor and I mentioned things like how he complains too much about random trivial things like the neighbors' kids sometimes playing on our lawn. \n\nI also mentioned how he has a fear of heights and how he was shaking the entire time when we crossed a rope bridge during our honeymoon. I did say a few other things like how I sometimes feel like I\u2019m his parent.\r\n\nEveryone was interested and surprised to hear all of this, and we did share many laughs together. At some point, my husband walked into the conversation and quickly pieced together what we were talking about. The rest of the conversation was awkward after that.\r\n\nOn the drive home, my husband was not speaking. When I asked him if everything was alright, he said that I surprised him. I was annoyed by him being vague, so I told him that I knew that he wasn\u2019t feeling 100%, but that he was acting childish for not socializing and acting offended.\r\n\nHe said that it was childish and rude that I was sharing his personal details with our colleagues. I then told him that he was blowing things out of proportion, but he didn\u2019t respond, and the rest of the ride was silent.\r\n\nWhen we got home, we argued again about the night's events. My husband said my behavior was appalling and that he questioned if I had any respect for him. I was angry by his outburst so I told him that he was only being sensitive because I was technically his superior now and that what was really bothering him. The argument ended there, as my husband didn't want to \"waste any more time\" and went to bed.\n\nThis morning, I texted my younger sister what happened, and she accused me of being insensitive.\r\n\nAITA?\r", "created_utc": 1694263293, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16e4sds/aita_for_joking_about_my_husband_in_front_of_our/", "score": 645, "replies": ["#This is now a Proctologists Only Orifice\r\n\r\nWhen a post is in [POO\u2122 mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168bzq8/title_aita_monthly_open_forum_september_2023) only users with enough subreddit comment karma are able to comment.

It\u2019s bad enough that you mocked him and shared personal information about him to your work colleagues, but even worse that you mocked and shared personal information about him to *his * work colleagues.  And you mocked and ridiculed one of your subordinates.   Your behavior was completely unprofessional and disrespectful toward your marriage.", "I am shocked that one whole night's time last night plus your sister's reply this morning failed to make you realise that YTA big time.\n\nYour colleagues are curious about your husband? Sure, tell them about his hobbies, his work, where he comes from, etc. That would be enough.\n\nFear of heights, being a slob at home etc. is way beyond what your colleagues need to know.\n\nImagine your husband telling his colleagues, \"Oh my wife is a binge snack eater at home and she is afraid of spiders bla bla bla\" on your first time meeting his colleagues.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. You talked shit about your husband all night, to his coworkers for fucks sake.\n\nDo you even like the man? Grow tf up, and apologize, and hope he forgives you", "Seriously?  You're senior enough to have been promoted, but you don't understand the basics of professional behavior?  Of course YTA.\n\nTo be frank, the vibe I get is that maybe you shouldn't have been promoted.  You don't sound mature enough to understand or supervise people.  I ,hope I'm wrong but I foresee a lot of drama in your team.  If it turns out that you're not up to the responsibility, then you could get a bad reputation and find it hard to move on to another position.\n\nIt was completely fine for your husband to focus on talking to just a few people.  He attended the event--and it's fine and normal that he didn't want to spend his free time at a work event.  Do you really not get that people have different styles as far as interacting with others?  I feel sorry for the people you're in charge of now.\n\nAs for the personal comments, it's hard to know what to say.  Are you actually confused about what's appropriate personal information to share about your spouse or are you looking to make excuses after you chose to run your husband down to make yourself look better?\n\nAlso, it's weird that you keep talking about being his \"superior.\"  You mention it over and over--both to us and him.  The problem is not him.  It's that you're immature and have no idea how to behave or treat people.", "YTA for putting what others will think say over how your husband felt and bullied him into going to an event he didn't want to go.\n\nYTA for what you have talked about your husband in a workplace!  you literally only talked shit about him. doesn't matter if its true that was a place of work and what happens at home doesn't have room in a workplace! if you are not happy with your husband at home get a divorce don't humiliate him at work! \n\nYTA even because after he told you how it made him feel you still made it about you and accused him of jealousy.\n\nwant more?", "YTA, he\u2019s introverted and wasn\u2019t feeling well and you bullied him into going anyway \u201cso people wouldn\u2019t think he jealous of you\u201d.

You big time TA.", "YTA. From your description, I don't see your husband being jealous of you. Instead, it appears that you might harbor a hidden sense of superiority due to your higher position. You might not be willing to admit it, but it seems like you're doing your best to subtly belittle him in various situations and in front of others to highlight your own status.", "Wow! You\u2019re not a very good partner nor manager. This was a huge betrayal & very unprofessional. \n\nI say this as a 54 yo woman, business owner & married for 32 years.

That's horrible. You owe him an apology.", "YTA, he didn\u2019t wanna go and you made/coerced him to go. You then told all of his colleagues about fears and how he\u2019s a crap husband. And by the sounds of it, keep on saying to him that he must be jealous that you\u2019re his superior. I wouldn\u2019t say anything to my partners colleagues that is disrespectful about them, not only does it make your partner look bad but it makes your relationship look crap because you\u2019re talking without respect.", "YTA! You basically outed yourself this entire post from a) admitting your husband is an introvert and then pointedly sharing embarrassing stories about him to b) actively gaslighting and getting angry with him when it sounds like he was being completely reasonable in his complaints. I recommend therapy. Not couples therapy btw. Jesus OP, seems like you have a lot you need to fix at both work and home with this one.", "YTA. A real one. You have zero respect for your husband. You can tell yourself it's all about you having a higher position at work than him, but you haven't given us any reason to believe that - while you have described to us very clearly how you think it's fine to make fun of him in front of other people and get angry at him when he is offended and hurt. It's clearly a YOU problem.", ">My husband didn\u2019t really want to go (he\u2019s pretty introverted), he also said he had a migraine and didn\u2019t want to make it worse.\n\nValid reasons for not wanting to attend.\n\n>I told them he was the complete opposite at home.

First you forced him to Go when He was Feeling i'll( disrespecting him) and then you share his fears and habits to His coworkers. And then you Invalide His Feelings again", "YTA - You don't share intimate details of your life with co-workers, especially if your husband isn't an active and willing participant in the conversation. That was out of line. These people aren't family or close friends.\n\nYour husband was gracious enough to go when he didn't want to, and why? So that no one would make assumptions about your workplace superiority spilling into your marriage. Yet, the moment he's out of earshot, you're making jokes at his expense, telling people his biggest fears, and basically asserting your rank above him at home too by telling his co-workers that you feel like his parent. It's already weird enough to have couples working in the same company. You just made it weirder, and made yourselves a topic of water cooler conversation.\n\nWhen he confronted you about it, you threw it in his face that he was bitter about your being his superior. Yet at the start of this post, you made him out to be your big cheerleader. What gives? Is this really about your issues with your new position rather than his?\n\nRegardless, I would be livid. You should be apologizing and having a discussion about what's appropriate to share with co-workers. Co-workers don't need to know your business.\n\nEDIT a typo", "YTA.  Absolutely no question.\n\nYou have a theory that your husband is secretly unhappy that you're his superior so you drag him to an event that he doesn't want to go to and then publicly humiliate him in front of his colleagues.\n\nDon't be surprised if he doesn't want to \"waste any more time\" with you permanently.", "YTA I don't understand why you are married to this man because it is clear that you don't respect him and you don't love him either because you don't humiliate the people you love.", "YTA. You knew he didn't want to be there and it wasn't something he was comfortable doing. You convinced him to come and then embarrassed him in front of his co workers. You are the problem, it's you.", "YTA. My partner did what you did to me what you did to your husband, our relationship would be done. That was cruel and unnecessary. Anyone else you did that to would have legit grounds to go straight to HR. What on earth were you thinking?", "YTA\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t talk about any other employee in that manner, and your partner should get the same respect. He\u2019s introverted and already having a hard time fitting in socially, his has only made that harder for him.", "Wow\u2026.YTA\u2026you dragged to him to this work event and then embarrassed him in front of all your mutual colleagues.  You call him childish for not socializing and acting offended and basically dismissed his feelings.  \n\nYou\u2019ve let the power of this promotion go to your head.  So much so that you shared personal info about your marriage, betraying his trust.  Don\u2019t you think those colleagues are going to talk about what a shitty marriage you have?  Don\u2019t you think they\u2019ll talk behind your back  about what a shitty wife you are to be so disrespectful of your husband.  I can only imagine how your husband will feel going back to the office knowing his colleagues know so much personal stuff and probably gossiping behind his back.  Talk about an uncomfortable or dare I say hostile environment created by his superior. \n\nYou might have been the center of attention and getting the laughs that night but the biggest joke will be on you.  You seem very insecure and need to take a deep look at your behavior.  Being his superior at work doesn\u2019t give you the right to accuse him of being jealous when he\u2019s expressing his feelings or share personal info with work colleagues.  Instead of focusing on your professional success, focus on being a better, understanding, caring partner.", "YTA..\n\nRidiculing him to your colleagues???  I would be pissed...  his reaction to this was restrained..\n\nDoubt you'll be able to drag him to another of these events anytime soon...", "So, let me get this straight\u2026.. Not only did you convince him to go to the work event when he didn\u2019t want to and had a migraine, but you also then proceeded to trash talk him to your (and his) coworkers and laughed about his flaws. He is right, your respect for him is non existent.\nHard YTA", "YTA You are acting like your husband is now somehow beneath you. You pressured him into going somewhere when he was unwell and didn't want to go. Then you got irate that he wasn't socialising to your standards - whilst unwell. Belittled and humiliated him to his peers. Then, when he was justifiably upset, you tried to gaslight him into taking the blame for your actions, because he is only upset because you are \"technically his superior \" now. Apologise for your behaviour and get over yourself.", "YTA. Maybe his next wife will show him love. You're more interested in being his boss than his wife. You're lucky he hasn't left over this because most people would. It's never a good look when you denigrate others to make yourself look good. Let me reiterate, YTA!!!", "He's got a fear of heights, but was brave enough to cross a rope bridge with you for your honeymoon?  Sounds like he really loved you.   Hope you've enjoyed blowing that up.  YTA.", "YTA you should never talk bad about your husband in a group setting especially if you work together. If the situation was reversed and he was bashing you, wouldn\u2019t you be upset that he wasn\u2019t respectful of your feelings? Your partner should be the person you are able to trust and confide in. The person who has your back. No wonder he doesn\u2019t want to go to such events. He probably realizes how you talk about him in public.", "YTA\n\nWhy would you celebrate a promotion by bullying and ganging up on an employee that's lower than you? Do you think that now you have the right to treat him like that or something? \n\nSuper unprofessional because you're at a work function, not to mention a huge betrayal of trust because he's supposed to be your other half, not your punching bag. \n\nIf he had a headache and didn't want to go you should have respected that and let him have that time to recuperate. You seem to assume that his headache is fake or not worth your consideration, but what if he really just felt like shit and wanted to avoid light and noises? \n\nIt was literally adding insult to injury that you made fun of him after forcing him to go when he didn't feel well. \n\nDo you even like your husband?", "Yeah, fuck that shit. I hate if my wife sometimes mention my home habits to others. YTA. Wait wait wait. You dare to say stuff like \"I am now his superior\"?? To your husband??? I hope he leaves you.", "YTA\nYour promotion immediately went to your head.\nThe saddest part of this is that not only did you presented your husband in an humiliating way to BOTH your colleagues.

You pressured your husband into going, then spent a decent portion of the night telling everyone you feel like his parent and trash talking him.\n\nGet off that supervisor high horse of yours, fast, before someone with an ounce of sense realizes you\u2019ve got no business being up there with that kinda behavior.", "Wow. YTA a thousand times over. \n\nYou feel like your husband might be insecure about you being his superior in the workplace, so your solution is to make fun of him while he\u2019s right there in earshot of you, to a bunch of your employees/coworkers? You rail on his personality traits and at-home living habits, mock him, call him a child and a coward, and then when he\u2019s upset with you, your response is \u201cyou are just mad because my job is better than yours\u201d???? WOW you are without a doubt one of the most obliviously obnoxious people on Reddit. Granted, it\u2019s not very \u201c2023\u201d for a husband to be jealous of his wife\u2019s job title/position, but that doesn\u2019t give you the right to talk shit about him to everyone at your workplace IN FRONT OF HIM. That\u2019s such a massive betrayal of trust and you\u2019re spitting on your marriage vows by doing that. You emasculated, mocked and embarrassed the man you claim to love in front of everyone at work that he\u2019ll have to interact with for the rest of his career. And you wonder why he\u2019s deeply upset with you? I don\u2019t care if you were the most beautiful woman in the world, I wouldn\u2019t want ANYTHING to do with you if I was him. \n\nMy wife and I are a TEAM. We have each others backs, and are always there to support each other, because the way we see it, it\u2019s us against the world. I would never ever do what you\u2019ve described doing here. And I know she wouldn\u2019t either. Sure we joke or complain about each others (very minor) flaws\u2026. To our BEST FRIENDS. Not our coworkers. And we don\u2019t even do that very much since we both deeply love and respect each other. You obviously have zero respect for your husband or his feelings. Not that I expect you to do this, but you should really take some time to think over what you\u2019ve done here. How your words and actions have hurt the person you claim to love. \n\nYour husband sounds really sweet, btw. Maybe he\u2019ll eventually realize how awful you are and find someone who will love him enough not to mock him in front of people. Someone who will give him the basic respect and dignity that a marriage should have. I honestly would be seriously considering leaving you if I was him, and you know what? He\u2019d be right to do so.", "Dont need to read more, he tells you isnt feeling good and you have to pressure him into going with you.", "What a giant AH!!  First you insist he go to an event even though he's told you he doesn't want to and isn't feeling well, then you trash talk him to all of your colleagues because it's getting you attention.  And you don't understand why he's upset?  Gawd you sound hideous!", "YTA big time. \nYour man is an introvert and still you insist, he come with you and socialize which must be hard for him but he did it for you. \n\nAnd then you think it\u2019s okay to make fun of him in front of his co-workers? Like it\u2019s not hard enough for him dealing with social situations as it is you need to make him feel really bad and awkward at his work place in the future? That\u2019s a real AH-move. \n\nDo you have any empathy? \n\nPlus you come across like you are feeling pretty superiour over him due to your promotion and seem to enjoy putting him down. \n\nI hope he\u2018s okay.", "YTA x100. You all but forced him to go to a party he didn't want to go (while he wasn't feeling good), then made sure every one of your colleagues, people he has to work with mind you, know about all the personal things that make him look less than. Nothing charming or appealing, oh no, literally everything and anything that might make him look bad or unappealing. \n\nWhen you naturally sensed that you did something wrong (you did), you doubled down by making it about you and how he's just jealous of your promotion and not the fact that you shared personal details about him that he did not want shared. How far up your own ass are you, exactly?\n\nIf even your little sister could tell how outrageous you were, perhaps you should take a long hard look in the mirror and try to comprehend what you did. \n\nYour husband thinks you don't respect him because you don't, and everyone at that party pretty much knows that now too. What a self absorbed AH.", "YTA. Utterly absurd behaviour and attitudes.", "YTA.  He wasn't feeling well yet you coerced him into going with you. You then ragged on him to his co-workers and colleagues. ( The only reason it got awkward after he showed up was because everybody else knew what you did was wrong. You don't rag on your partner to his co-workers or his friends because that's private information) You then dismissed his feelings saying that hes overreacting and acting childish. \n\nYou're being horrible to this man. You've made a lot of assumptions. You're putting words in his mouth. And when he's trying to tell you how he feels about the situation you're like oh it's not that serious oh you're so childish. \n\nI guarantee you if roles were reversed here you wouldn't like that one bit. \n\nIf your husband got a promotion, strong arming you when you are not feeling well and have a migraine to a social event, then talk badly about you to your co-workers, telling them on how sometimes he feels like your parent, before finally saying that you're overreacting, you're acting childish, you're being too sensitive etc on the way home. \n\nit looks to me like you've been jealous that he was higher than you in the company for a while, but now that you're his superior you want to rub it in his face and put him down a peg. \n\nHaving a \"feeling\" that he's embarrassed with you is complete horse ninny.  Has he said anything to you like that, have you talked about this situation or you making assumptions?  A lot of the time as women we pick up on hints, that aren't actually hints, but something we perceive to be a hint due to how we communicate.  There have been plenty of times where I believe my partner had feelings at something when in actuality he didn't have anything of the sort\n\nYour younger sister is correct.  \n\nYou've painted him in such a bad light to his co-workers. You've dismissed his feelings on the topic. You treated him like a nuisance. And were incredibly sexist at the end there saying that the only reason he has to be upset is because you got a promotion and he didn't. \n\nHe has a lot more to be upset about than that.\n\n If my partner treated me in this way, I would rethink our relationship because that is not okay.\n\nYou said this happened a month ago why are you only asking about this now?  Was there something that significant happened since then that you still feel bad about it?", "YTA 100%. Why are you with your husband again? I think you\u2019re the problem. Your husband doesn\u2019t sound embarrassed of your position, but you surely seem to think you\u2019re better than him now because of it. You didn\u2019t include a single positive about him with coworkers and instead shared intimate moments and details of his life without his consent or presence.", "YTA. You failed both your husband and your team member. \n\nAs a wife, you don\u2019t show any love. Bothering him to go to a work party with a migraine coming up, talking shit about him to his colleagues, and even making fun of him? Why? \n\nAs a manager, you\u2019ve failed not only the employee concerned, but also the entire team, by letting them on to believe that bullying is somehow funny. And you\u2019ve also failed yourself, as this action will undermine any trust the team may have had in your management capabilities. \n\nIt\u2019s time to get off that high horse and give yourself a good look in the mirror.

Your conversation breached professional boundaries.\n\nYou invalidated your husband's feelings.\n\nYou called him \"sensitive\" when he tried to communicate how he felt which is like the number one dogwhistle for being an AH.\n\nEven if he WAS jealous of your position, how airing him out as an incompetent person was gonna fix that?

I am now in a more senior position than my husband (M41) at work. My husband has always told me how happy he was that I got the promotion. But sometimes I get the feeling that he\u2019s embarrassed that I\u2019m technically his superior now.\r\n\nLast night, we had a work-related social event. It was supposed to be an opportunity to build team cohesion and that sort of thing. My husband didn\u2019t really want to go (he\u2019s pretty introverted), he also said he had a migraine and didn\u2019t want to make it worse.\r\n\nI told him that it would be weird if he didn\u2019t come, and people might think that he\u2019s jealous of me getting the promotion. After some more persuasion, I was able to convince him to come along. When we got there, he greeted a few people but ended up spending most of the time sitting in a corner on his own and only chatting with a few people at a time.\r\n\nAside from that, the event was pretty good, and most of our co-workers were present. At some point, I was in a large group when (Sarah F46), who had not yet seen my husband there, asked where he was and jokingly asked if he was as serious and mysterious at home as he was at work.\r\n\nI told them he was the complete opposite at home. I said that while at work he seems organized, at home he\u2019s a bit of a slob. I joked about how he always leaves his laundry all over the floor and I mentioned things like how he complains too much about random trivial things like the neighbors' kids sometimes playing on our lawn. \n\nI also mentioned how he has a fear of heights and how he was shaking the entire time when we crossed a rope bridge during our honeymoon. I did say a few other things like how I sometimes feel like I\u2019m his parent.\r\n\nEveryone was interested and surprised to hear all of this, and we did share many laughs together. At some point, my husband walked into the conversation and quickly pieced together what we were talking about. The rest of the conversation was awkward after that.\r\n\nOn the drive home, my husband was not speaking. When I asked him if everything was alright, he said that I surprised him. I was annoyed by him being vague, so I told him that I knew that he wasn\u2019t feeling 100%, but that he was acting childish for not socializing and acting offended.\r\n\nHe said that it was childish and rude that I was sharing his personal details with our colleagues. I then told him that he was blowing things out of proportion, but he didn\u2019t respond, and the rest of the ride was silent.\r\n\nWhen we got home, we argued again about the night's events. My husband said my behavior was appalling and that he questioned if I had any respect for him. I was angry by his outburst so I told him that he was only being sensitive because I was technically his superior now and that what was really bothering him. The argument ended there, as my husband didn't want to \"waste any more time\" and went to bed.\n\nThis morning, I texted my younger sister what happened, and she accused me of being insensitive.\r\n\nAITA?\r\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Honestly y\u2019all need to communicate with each other and be willing to resolve issues as well as accept your own part in this disagreement. Obviously your husband doesn\u2019t like you sharing your home life with coworkers so you shouldn\u2019t do that anymore. However if he isn\u2019t willing to be honest about how he feels about your promotion then he can\u2019t be upset with you for not knowing how he feels.", "And she disregarded his migraine and essentially forced him to go when he did not feel well enough for that, and then mocked him for sitting on the side and talking only to a couple of person at a time while being an introvert **with a migraine**.\n\nMassive YTA to OP.", "OP, YTA \u2026 your conduct was insensitive, and unprofessional, a bully, immature, and possibly even passive aggressive. \n\nHe didn\u2019t want to attend the function on account of his migraine - a completely legitimate reason.

But, he attended after being pressured by you.\n\nDuring the event, he managed as best as he could under the circumstances. Apparently, his efforts were inadequate, so you started running him down behind his back to colleagues - unprofessional, immature, passive aggressive. Things got awkward when he joined the group because *EVERYONE* present was painfully aware of the ick factor of your conduct. Very disrespectful for a spouse; doubly so for a coworker. This is no \u201cjoke\u201d - don\u2019t even attempt to diminish your faux pas here. \n\nYou owe him a HUGE apology and while you\u2019re at it, you should apologize to your colleagues for your inappropriate diatribe.

First, you project your take that Hubs must be feeling hurt/disappointed/embarrassed (emasculated?) by your new post-promotion, \"superior\" role, & then you demean him by making negative comments about him to coworkers.

You're insufferable.\nFYI that your little performance at Hub's expense may also cost you dearly at work. As a colleague, I'd be appalled by your cruelty & would not trust you moving forward. As a manager, I'd call you in with HR the next work day to address your attempted humiliation of another employee, marital status irrelevant.

Massive YTA.", "It really makes me wonder if OP even likes her husband. I can't tell if it's a superiority complex or built up resentment about \"having to take care of him\" and \"having to make him do basic things\".

YTA, OP.", "She topped that little parfait off with the \"you're just butt hurt I'm in a supervisory position over you now\" cherry.\n\nOP, I think YOU'RE the one with the chip on your shoulder because of the promotion.

As an introvert and someone who is personally chronically ill, I\u2019m not going to shit if my social battery is low AND I feel unwell unless it\u2019s like a thing with a friend I rarely see because they live in another state (and then they lecture me a bit and say they would rather I take care of myself lmfaoooo). OP YTA JUST FOR THAT. The rest of this BS is digging an even deeper hole of being the AH that cannot be climbed back out of. And tbh? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this destroyed any trust her team has in her! If she mocked her husband like that, how would the team trust that they wouldn\u2019t be treated in the same cruel manner? \n\n\nI also just think it\u2019s a bad decision in general for spouses to work together. My mother met both of her ex husbands at work. The first who is not my father was so abusive to her that she eventually quit her job and moved back home because divorcing and not living with him was great, but she couldn\u2019t avoid him at work.

So yeah, it is possible to have a migraine, yet still be able to do the limited socializing he did.\n\nAnd yeah, OP is definitely TA for everything. From making him go with a migraine, expecting an introvert to socialize more than he's comfortable with, demeaning an employee under them to other employees, exposing private (possibly embarrassing) details of an employee she only has access to due to their marital status to other employees, clearly having something going on with being a \"superior\" to hubs and accusing him of having an issue with it when his behaviour doesn't indicate that he does (or, at least the behaviour described in the post), and then thinking hubs standing up for himself after all this is out of bounds. (Am I missing anything?) Yeah, OP, YTA big time.", "Especially at work!!! I can\u2019t believe it. Some people never grow up from high school, I swear.", "Usually in such situation you'd expect your SO to be the one to have your back if somebody started talking shit about you. In this case she betrayed her husband, took him to the ground and kicked him while at it.", "Well, can't you see, with her new promotion, it's clear she must be *so* much better than him! Of course he can't ever be good enough for OP!", "Because hubby wasn\u2019t throwing confetti, ringing a gong and singing his praises about her to the coworkers/s\n\nEdited: changed yelling to singing", "Seriously, who chats to more than a few people at a time at these things? And with a migraine too! Are you supposed to be wowing everybody at the party at once? OP sounds liek the kind of insufferable extrovert who somehow feels uncomfortable around introverts and feels the need to make an example of them.", "I was thinking the same. Also, you have a much better chanse at building bonds / get to lnow people when there's few people in a conversation than in a big crowed. I learned a lot of surprising things about my previous coworkers from other departements when there were 3 or 4 present in conversations.", "Seriously! I'm pretty introverted but I can handle being in big groups when I have to, and chatting with just a few people at a time is what makes it so that I even remotely enjoy myself. I'll bounce around, but in now way am I going to make myself the center of a larger group like OP did. She's nasty.\n\nYTA", "Manipulated him into going.  I feel sorry for the husband.", "Right?! She didn\u2019t get enough satisfaction at the party so here we are \ud83d\ude44", "Demorced.", "What the fuck is wrong with you?", "I get the sense that *she* *thinks* she's outgrown him. But it sems like he's doing *far* better than she is as far as maturity goes. What a shit partner, colleague, and \"superior\" she is.  I *kind* of hope he goes to HR with this and they take her promotion away.", "You could be right.  The thing about that kind of dynamic though is that there's a high chance it'll bite the OP at some point.  She will irritate people and make enemies or those yes-men will turn on her when they sense her job is up for grabs.", "Conceited, unaware, insufferable people often think highly of themselves without justification. She can\u2019t handle the truth. In her heart of hearts she knows she\u2019s the issue.", "You mean gaslamping? It's originally from that play where the guy keeps turning the gas lamps down to make his wife think she's going crazy, hence gaslamping.", "I think they don't know what subtle means, it's used as more of a prefix now a lot of time, just like \"literally\". Sigh.", "You love him so much that you belittled him and told your employees, his colleagues, that sometimes you feel like his parent.  That\u2019s love right there, telling embarrassing stories about your spouse at a work event.", "Then act like it.  Tell people the good things about him instead of all of your dislikes and things that make him look bad.  Whatever my private frustrations with my spouse, those are kept private or at most shared with a couple of my trusted friends.  To the rest of the world, I am his biggest cheerleader.", "THEN STOP TREATING HIM LIKE SHIT EVERY CHANCE YOU GET. YTA.", "I wish we could all tell that by the way you treat him but instead you feel so insecure about this promotion that you decided to take it out on him and belittle him to convince yourself you\u2019re worth it", "Do you though? You\u2019re married to him. He is supposed to be your person. You can bring the shit up in private any day of the week, but in public, most especially to his work colleagues, you are his person. Why are you giving his work people ammo to belittle him (he\u2019s a slob)? To keep him from getting work (he\u2019s unorganized)? To look down on him (his wife acts like his mom)? You may have been caught in the moment, caught up in being a main character, but that is never an excuse to beat down your spouse!", "I mean, maybe Sarah will treat him better.", "And leading the conga line", "I bet had he done everything she wanted him to do in the fashion she wanted him to do it she\u2019d still be pissed that he upstaged her.", "Even there it shows how ignorant she is. Like, \u201che doesn\u2019t like to go, because he\u2019s an introvert [so it doesn\u2019t count]\u201d like, the fact he doesn\u2019t think like her is a deficit to be eliminated.", "Well, no fun using him as a punching bag if she can\u2019t see his reaction, eh? Free yourself, hubby!", "It's a classic bully behavior, too. Goading someone into coming into a social event for the sole purpose of publicly humiliating them.\n\nOP, a 30-something year old grown woman, bullied her own husband. holy shit.", "Probably all of their coworkers do too. She came off as a full of herself bully. A really nasty personality came out and people will talk about it for years behind her back.", "upvote x 1000 for Demorced!", "Certainly not devoted", "My assumption is that many if not all of those coworkers present are talking about how catty and unprofessional OP is.", "\\`You're thinking of \"Gaslight.\"  The lights dim because the husband is in the attic searching for his wife's late aunt's jewels and turning on the gaslight there.  He tries to convince her she's going mad by claiming to be \"pout\" when it happens.  He also does another things.\n\n\\`You're thinking of \"Gaslight.\"  The lights dim because the husband is in the attic searching for his wife's late aunt's jewels and turning on the gaslight there.

He also does other things.", "I think you\u2019re right.   \n\n\nI find it fascinating how many people don\u2019t know simple words.", "Not just at a work event. He works there too. He\u2019ll never feel comfortable at work again.", "I ship it.", "How could i forget the conga line? And the marching band", "I agree! Especially when, after spending lord knows how long dominating the conversation to bitch about her husband, she says \u201cthe conversation was awkward after that.\u201d \n\nShe\u2019s jealous that the coworker who approached her seems to have a good opinion of her husband so she had to tear him down. It\u2019s disgusting.", "Yesss!! She tried to ruin his image instead, OP hates her husband, and is clearly in a make believe contest with him. She wants him to be jealous so bad, and he doesn't seem to be."]}
