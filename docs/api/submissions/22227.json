My (42m) wife (40f) went away for a business trip last weekend. My son (16) asked me if his boyfriend (17) could stay the night and I said that if was fine by me even though my wife would have said no and has said that he isn\u2019t allowed to stay over in the past (which isn\u2019t something that I agree with but I know that it\u2019s an argument I wouldn\u2019t be able to win). I thought that I might as well let my kid enjoy himself and what my wife didn\u2019t know didn\u2019t hurt her.\n\nI don\u2019t know how but somehow she found out about it after she got back and is furious about it. She says that it\u2019s inappropriate for them to be left alone in private due to their age overnight and I\u2019ve told her that a) our son has probably gotten up to whatever she fears they\u2019ll get up to already so what\u2019s the harm and b) how is it inappropriate if they\u2019re both above the age of consent. After that she\u2019s saying that what I did was a \u201cbreach of trust\u201d and shows that I \u201cdon\u2019t respect her as a parent\u201d, which I\u2019ve told her is ludicrous.\n\nUsually I\u2019d think that my wife was being too prudish about the whole situation but she\u2019s since wrangled mutual friends into the matter and for whatever reason they agree with her so now I\u2019m not so sure.", "created_utc": 1689351336, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zko96/aita_for_letting_my_sons_boyfriend_stay_over/", "score": 728, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Add on the fact that things seem to be pretty 'my way or the highway' and not willing to compromise isn't a great look either. \n\nAt the end of the day your wife doesn't think teenagers in relationships should spend the night together, and you know teenagers in relationships are going to do what they do regardless of time of day or location.

But a veto isn\u2019t what she doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt her. A veto is a discussion with your wife on how you disagree. You can even tell her, \u201chey I am letting them spend the night because I don\u2019t see anything wrong with it. I know you disagree and we won\u2019t see eye to eye on this.\u201d Without a discussion, you dismissed her rule and lied by omission about it.

Does she not like that her son is gay or that she had a big deal with age differences? Even in high school, a one year age difference isn\u2019t that big of a deal.

Yeah same with the 2 guys (Or 2 girls). 16 isn\u2019t old enough (regardless of what ANYONE says) to decide if you want to or should have sex. Sex changes relationships, this is a fact. You should have listened to your wife.

I doubt you'd have the same flippant attitude if that were a daughter with her boyfriend.

I see no problem for a BF/GF staying over, and furthermore, I think the whole \u201cno BF/GF sleepover\u201d is based on prudish religious thinking that is quite outdated today.", "YTA. You knew your wife wouldn\u2019t be okay with it, your son knew she wouldn\u2019t be okay with it, but you went behind her back and undermined her parenting and her rules by letting him. You may not agree with the rule, but not letting a child\u2019s boyfriend or girlfriend spend the night is pretty standard. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s prudish as long as your son is still getting proper sex education rather than your wife going the \u201cabstinence only, no discussion of sex in this house\u201d way with it. If you think the rule is worth changing you should\u2019ve talked it over with your wife and made sure you both could share your points of view and seen if you could reach a compromise about it, not use the first chance you had to go over her head.", "YTA. and not because of the sex, I agree 100% with most of the N T A on that score, providing a safe and aware (educated) space for teens is important.\n\nYour wife said no, and you snuck behind her back, undermining her as a parent. Stopping teenagers from spending the night isn't just about stopping pregnancy. Obviously, not a concern here. It's about allowing teenagers space from an intense relationship to grow as individuals. Teens spending too much time with a SO can lead to co dependency, especially if one has a much stronger personality than the other.", "This is one of those parenting differences that gets presented like there is no wrong answer and it\u2019s a personal judgment issue. I\u2019m sorry, but the facts are on your side. When teens are supported by their parents in making safe decisions about their sexual health/life, they\u2019re less likely to engage in risky behavior. NTA. Cheers on being a responsible and realistic parent. \n\nI will say though if he\u2019s allowed to have sleepovers at home, I hope he is familiar with how to access sexual health resources. If he\u2019s sexually active, he should be getting tested regularly. As he gets older it will set him up for success to already know that stuff like getting tested or getting on PrEP is normal and responsible behavior. This sounds like the kind of thing you already have covered, though, frankly!", "[deleted]", "You shouldn't have undermined your wife like that, but honestly I think you're right about everything else. What is she worried about, anyway, a teen pregnancy? lmao.   \n\n\n A better move would have been to tell your son that no, his boyfriend can't stay because his mother doesn't want it to happen, but that as long as he's being safe and reasonable, there's no reason he can't have fun with his boyfriend outside of the no-overnight rules. Just make sure you've talked to him about consent and boundaries, how to advocate for himself, and not being afraid to say no to things he doesn't want.  Then maybe absent yourself from the house for a while during the daytime.", "NTA - it's not like there's any chance of one of them getting knocked up, it's there...", "NTA\n\nNo matter if it\u2019s bf/gf, gf/gf, or bf/bf..all rules should be the same PERIOD.

That means I want them to have all the information possible, I want them to have the tools (ie. birth control/condoms and health tests) to stay safe, and I'd rather they have sex in a safe place (such as their bed) than in an unsafe place (such as some bushes in a park or something). All your wife is doing is pushing your child to engage in unsafe activities. Regardless of how \"prudish\" she is, you need to sit her down and educate her on the danger SHE is putting your son is.

My (42m) wife (40f) went away for a business trip last weekend. My son (16) asked me if his boyfriend (17) could stay the night and I said that if was fine by me even though my wife would have said no and has said that he isn\u2019t allowed to stay over in the past (which isn\u2019t something that I agree with but I know that it\u2019s an argument I wouldn\u2019t be able to win). I thought that I might as well let my kid enjoy himself and what my wife didn\u2019t know didn\u2019t hurt her.\n\nI don\u2019t know how but somehow she found out about it after she got back and is furious about it. She says that it\u2019s inappropriate for them to be left alone in private due to their age overnight and I\u2019ve told her that a) our son has probably gotten up to whatever she fears they\u2019ll get up to already so what\u2019s the harm and b) how is it inappropriate if they\u2019re both above the age of consent. After that she\u2019s saying that what I did was a \u201cbreach of trust\u201d and shows that I \u201cdon\u2019t respect her as a parent\u201d, which I\u2019ve told her is ludicrous.\n\nUsually I\u2019d think that my wife was being too prudish about the whole situation but she\u2019s since wrangled mutual friends into the matter and for whatever reason they agree with her so now I\u2019m not so sure.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Most STDs can be cured with antibiotics and all of them at this point can be medically managed.
