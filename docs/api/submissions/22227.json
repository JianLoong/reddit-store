My (42m) wife (40f) went away for a business trip last weekend. My son (16) asked me if his boyfriend (17) could stay the night and I said that if was fine by me even though my wife would have said no and has said that he isn\u2019t allowed to stay over in the past (which isn\u2019t something that I agree with but I know that it\u2019s an argument I wouldn\u2019t be able to win). I thought that I might as well let my kid enjoy himself and what my wife didn\u2019t know didn\u2019t hurt her.\n\nI don\u2019t know how but somehow she found out about it after she got back and is furious about it. She says that it\u2019s inappropriate for them to be left alone in private due to their age overnight and I\u2019ve told her that a) our son has probably gotten up to whatever she fears they\u2019ll get up to already so what\u2019s the harm and b) how is it inappropriate if they\u2019re both above the age of consent. After that she\u2019s saying that what I did was a \u201cbreach of trust\u201d and shows that I \u201cdon\u2019t respect her as a parent\u201d, which I\u2019ve told her is ludicrous.\n\nUsually I\u2019d think that my wife was being too prudish about the whole situation but she\u2019s since wrangled mutual friends into the matter and for whatever reason they agree with her so now I\u2019m not so sure.", "created_utc": 1689351336, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zko96/aita_for_letting_my_sons_boyfriend_stay_over/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Add on the fact that things seem to be pretty 'my way or the highway' and not willing to compromise isn't a great look either. \n\nAt the end of the day your wife doesn't think teenagers in relationships should spend the night together, and you know teenagers in relationships are going to do what they do regardless of time of day or location.

You can even tell her, \u201chey I am letting them spend the night because I don\u2019t see anything wrong with it. I know you disagree and we won\u2019t see eye to eye on this.\u201d Without a discussion, you dismissed her rule and lied by omission about it.

Does she not like that her son is gay or that she had a big deal with age differences? Even in high school, a one year age difference isn\u2019t that big of a deal.

Yeah I agree with her. It isn\u2019t homophobic so please don\u2019t do that. Imagine a 16 yo girl with her 17 yo boyfriend. They obviously are going to have sex right? Yeah same with the 2 guys (Or 2 girls). 16 isn\u2019t old enough (regardless of what ANYONE says) to decide if you want to or should have sex. Sex changes relationships, this is a fact. You should have listened to your wife.

I doubt you'd have the same flippant attitude if that were a daughter with her boyfriend.

That\u2019s bad parenting and bad husbanding.", "NTA, your child asked you for permission and you gave it.

I see no problem for a BF/GF staying over, and furthermore, I think the whole \u201cno BF/GF sleepover\u201d is based on prudish religious thinking that is quite outdated today.", "YTA. You knew your wife wouldn\u2019t be okay with it, your son knew she wouldn\u2019t be okay with it, but you went behind her back and undermined her parenting and her rules by letting him. You may not agree with the rule, but not letting a child\u2019s boyfriend or girlfriend spend the night is pretty standard. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s prudish as long as your son is still getting proper sex education rather than your wife going the \u201cabstinence only, no discussion of sex in this house\u201d way with it. If you think the rule is worth changing you should\u2019ve talked it over with your wife and made sure you both could share your points of view and seen if you could reach a compromise about it, not use the first chance you had to go over her head.", "YTA. and not because of the sex, I agree 100% with most of the N T A on that score, providing a safe and aware (educated) space for teens is important.\n\nYour wife said no, and you snuck behind her back, undermining her as a parent. Stopping teenagers from spending the night isn't just about stopping pregnancy. Obviously, not a concern here. It's about allowing teenagers space from an intense relationship to grow as individuals. Teens spending too much time with a SO can lead to co dependency, especially if one has a much stronger personality than the other.", "This is one of those parenting differences that gets presented like there is no wrong answer and it\u2019s a personal judgment issue. I\u2019m sorry, but the facts are on your side.

Cheers on being a responsible and realistic parent. \n\nI will say though if he\u2019s allowed to have sleepovers at home, I hope he is familiar with how to access sexual health resources. If he\u2019s sexually active, he should be getting tested regularly. As he gets older it will set him up for success to already know that stuff like getting tested or getting on PrEP is normal and responsible behavior. This sounds like the kind of thing you already have covered, though, frankly!", "All the 'YTA' claims here seem kinda homophobic, as does your Wife. \n\nIn reality, EAH here because you shouldn't have gone behind your Wife's back and your Wife also shouldn't be so hard on your Son because he'll just close off from her or even you both. Your Son should feel safe in his own home yet he likely feels chastised and punished for having a boyfriend. Also, 17 is not a concerning age if that's your Wife's angle and it's not like he's going to get knocked up", "You shouldn't have undermined your wife like that, but honestly I think you're right about everything else. What is she worried about, anyway, a teen pregnancy? lmao.   \n\n\n A better move would have been to tell your son that no, his boyfriend can't stay because his mother doesn't want it to happen, but that as long as he's being safe and reasonable, there's no reason he can't have fun with his boyfriend outside of the no-overnight rules. Just make sure you've talked to him about consent and boundaries, how to advocate for himself, and not being afraid to say no to things he doesn't want.  Then maybe absent yourself from the house for a while during the daytime.", "NTA - it's not like there's any chance of one of them getting knocked up, it's there...", "NTA\n\nNo matter if it\u2019s bf/gf, gf/gf, or bf/bf..all rules should be the same PERIOD. It was kinda a dick move to go behind your old lady\u2019s back. It kinda sounds like your wife either doesn\u2019t trust the bf or doesn\u2019t trust them together.

That means I want them to have all the information possible, I want them to have the tools (ie. birth control/condoms and health tests) to stay safe, and I'd rather they have sex in a safe place (such as their bed) than in an unsafe place (such as some bushes in a park or something). All your wife is doing is pushing your child to engage in unsafe activities. Regardless of how \"prudish\" she is, you need to sit her down and educate her on the danger SHE is putting your son is.

My (42m) wife (40f) went away for a business trip last weekend. My son (16) asked me if his boyfriend (17) could stay the night and I said that if was fine by me even though my wife would have said no and has said that he isn\u2019t allowed to stay over in the past (which isn\u2019t something that I agree with but I know that it\u2019s an argument I wouldn\u2019t be able to win). I thought that I might as well let my kid enjoy himself and what my wife didn\u2019t know didn\u2019t hurt her.\n\nI don\u2019t know how but somehow she found out about it after she got back and is furious about it. She says that it\u2019s inappropriate for them to be left alone in private due to their age overnight and I\u2019ve told her that a) our son has probably gotten up to whatever she fears they\u2019ll get up to already so what\u2019s the harm and b) how is it inappropriate if they\u2019re both above the age of consent. After that she\u2019s saying that what I did was a \u201cbreach of trust\u201d and shows that I \u201cdon\u2019t respect her as a parent\u201d, which I\u2019ve told her is ludicrous.\n\nUsually I\u2019d think that my wife was being too prudish about the whole situation but she\u2019s since wrangled mutual friends into the matter and for whatever reason they agree with her so now I\u2019m not so sure.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She decided that it wouldn't happen and she didn't want to budge ...where his opinion here? Why it should be ignored?", "TYL (Today You Learned) that teens who are dating typically experiment. If you are sleeping with someone you're dating it's safe to assume that sexual activities are a possibility.\n\nDates end and then you gotta go home when you don't have your own place and you're also, in all reality, minors .You're not entitled to play house when you're 16. It's actually normal for 16 to end dates with both people going back to their own places.\n\nIs there a floor for what ages you think shouldn't be allowed *romantic date nights at one of their parents' home with sleepovers?*", "I mean yeah if I had a daughter I think I\u2019d be okay with it. Obviously a conversation would need to be had since the whole threat of pregnancy though.", "Absolutely. Better for teens to fuck in cars parked in abandoned construction sites.", "HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT", "Bless your heart.  You really tried didn\u2019t you?  \u201cA same sex couple can get into just as much trouble as a hetero one\u201d you said that.  I didn\u2019t.  And you do realize that the biggest issue for a vast majority of people is accidental teen pregnancy.  Sure STD risks, assault, all of that can still happen.  But last time I checked, the teen pregnancy thing is the biggest one pretty much all parents tend to be the most concerned about.  Especially with ya know, teens that perhaps are sexually experimenting for the first time\u2026implying that they  haven\u2019t had that much sexual experience beforehand.  You may need to work on the reading comprehension a little.", "You know what, you're right, just re-read and I thought OP's Son is 17 also so yeah, more reasonable imo. I think Wife really needs to sit down and talk to Son properly though because it can quickly get messy", "Thanks for explaining to me what I\u2019m saying. You are a bit ignorant", "She\u2019s harming his social life because he can\u2019t have his boyfriend sleep over whenever they want? Nobody else has parents that won\u2019t allow this? It\u2019s only your wife, and the entire school is isolating and treating your son like a pariah because of her decision? Come on, man.", "\nI said you're changing the context because a one on one sleepover between your son and his boyfriend is way different than a group sleepover. Your kid's gay so that means different but similar boundaries to us straights when in relationships.\n\nWhat does overnight mean? Did you let your son and his BF share a bed that night or did you tell the BF that he needs to sleep elsewhere like the couch or an air mattress? If the latter , do you think your wife would be less mad if BF slept away from your son?\n\nAnd do you think your wife might also be worried about the potential lack of condom use considering there isn't a worry of pregnancy means an increased risk of STD transmissions and that you could be enabling such actions by making it easy for the two to have sex vs putting a barrier in place?\n\nEdit: Barring group sleepovers might be weird but it's not uncommon now nor then to bar people from sleeping together who have an  increased potential of sex even if there are 3+ people", "That'd be pretty shitty of her, too\n\n\\-someone who had lots of friends who were girls, was straight, and had sleepovers at that age all the time.", "Just because he's gay doesn't mean he wants to fuck all boys, that's homophobic. The idea that he can't simply have male friends and be innocent about it. He has a boyfriend.", "Like yours?", "I'm not sure I understand the autonomy angle. If one partner wanted to let a bunch of people with autonomy move into their house and the other one doesn't, it isn't right to go behind their back and do it.\n\nAs for the trust and relationship with the son and his mom, that is a separate issue. The YTA is for OP going behind the previous agreement they made together. Believe me, I don't agree with her either.", "She has the upper hand on the argument imo. It's a pretty basic rule for teens not to have sleepovers with whoever they're dating. There was a set rule in place and op went around it. That's not cool.", "Sounds like you are indeed not a parent because if you were you would not be asking these questions. They are obvious questions that every couple has to grapple with and the non-AH answer is never \u201cwhat my husband/wife doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt them.\u201d", "When did I say it should? I explicitly said the two parents needed to have a discussion and come to some sort of agreement, as is the case in every healthy marriage on Earth. Ignoring the other parent and going behind their back is not the right move at all.", "Yes that\u2019s part of the point of age of consent. Yes the norm is for dates at 16 to end by going back to their own homes, but if parents from both teens say it\u2019s okay then it\u2019s nobodies place to tell them they\u2019re wrong lol", "Per OP, he is not allowed to have sleepovers with any male friends since he came out at 13. So it's not a rule about romantic dates, it's a rule about how he spends time with other guys generally.", "And I\u2019ve had plenty of sleepover dates w my boyfriend and we\u2019ve never done anything sexual.", "I truly highly doubt you would. And the fact you said you \u201cTHINK\u201d you\u2019d be okay with it says everything we all need to know. You can\u2019t even say a full enthusiastic yes because you know damn fucking well you wouldn\u2019t allow it", "But did you have a conversation with your son about the \u201cthreat\u201d of STDs and STIs?\n\nI highly doubt you would be okay with it if you had a daughter asking if her boyfriend could spend the night. Regardless if your wife is \u201cprudish\u201d you still need to both come to an agreement of boundaries instead of going behind her back.", "Just because you know teenagers are always looking for ways around your rules doesn't mean you should just give in and have no rules.\n\nI wouldn't let a 16 year old get hammered drunk in my living room just because there's a possibility that they might disobey me and get drunk at a friends house when the parents are out of town a month from now.", "You're not the only invisible in this town! (Surprised? I know, you probably didn't see me. \ud83d\ude06)", "No, my reading comprehension isn't the issue. The fact that your trying to double down on your ignorance instead of admitting you had a brain fart is. But live in your own carefree, consequence free world and try not to take anyone down with you.", "ok so explain it to me. if she says no? then it\u2019s a ___?\nif he says yes then it\u2019s a ___? fill in the blank", "Really grasping at straws here. He said that since the age of 13 he hasn't been allowed to have or go to any sleepovers. Like learn to read", "Plenty of parents set that boundaries. Not justifying it but I'm saying she ain't a homophobe for keeping it that way", "Plenty of parents have blanket policies of *no people that you might ever be interested in dating can sleepover.* It's actually quite normal. And before he said was gay she banned all girls. She doesn't want to enable her son's sex like at 16 in her home with his boyfriend.\n\n Shouldn't she be commended for opening her home to the BF, allowing him to stay over, but also maintaining her parental boundaries? Maybe she wants her son's room to be his room and not the place where his BF stays. Maybe she thinks that enabling sleeping over for one night is a slippery slope (and a rational one) to three nights and cements the relationship as very official? Maybe she wants her son to feel like he can have options and that he can more easily end the relationship? \n\nHe can sneak around in his home like everyone else at that age typically does. This son doesn't need his parents to enable overnight stays with the increased chance of sex in order to learn how to be good at romantic relationships. He needs his parents to think long term.", "You completely missed what I said. She is treating them the SAME WAY as if he was straight with female friends. That's what most parents do, they set boundaries like that. You're just assuming homophobia even though he's being treated the same as a straight could would", "HOWEVER, for us older folks whose parents usually had those No overnight rules for anyone of the opposite sex, they certainly didn\u2019t make the distinction between just friends or dating. When I was a teenager, it was simply no boys overnight (or in my room with the door shut) PERIOD. EVEN my best friend who was male and gay and my dad knew he was gay. So\u2026. I just don\u2019t agree with that argument meaning she must be homophonic (although she certainly COULD Be). We just don\u2019t know for certain.", "My point is the kid could have just asked to stay at a friends house and not mentioned anything about the bf to dad. Which still would have made mom mad. Which means the son ain\u2019t an object like a dishwasher. It\u2019s one thing to not want to spend money on something, it\u2019s different when you\u2019re talking about a third person who doesn\u2019t have to listen to their parents if they choose not to.", "And in case of disagreement and the other person doesn't want to budge why his opinion should be the rule... and not the opinion of the other person....regarding their son..someone with his own minds and wants ? Why she should dictate in this matter?", "Who would want to know their 16 year old child is being plowed in the very next room. \ud83e\udd14", "Listen clown, it\u2019s about respect and he didn\u2019t respect what his wife said. You talk it out in a successful relationship. Good luck in yours because you sound like an AH. Your silly to think I gotta think the way you think. I\u2019m not part of your circus", "And? My kid has a friend who cant have sleepovers in high school. That\u2019s strict but she still has friends and they still hang out, she just can\u2019t sleep anywhere else. People can and do survive strict parents. It\u2019s been known to happen on occasion.", "But if he was straight he'd be allowed have male friends sleep over right? Ffs", "Eh I see your point, but I don't think it works in the context of the agreement OP made with his wife. If the son had snuck into the house without OP knowing, then OP would not have breached their agreement.", "He\u2019s under 18 living in their house so he\u2019s subject to their rules. When he moves out, he can do as he pleases. Until then, his own minds and wants are secondary to the homeowners. \n\nAs for disagreements, this happens very frequently. I am married for years. We disagree. If we can\u2019t agree, then we usually go for the thing that causes the least stress or change. For example, if I want a dog and my wife doesn\u2019t, and I can\u2019t get her to agree, should I just ignore her and bring a dog home? Of course not. \n\nThis is a similar situation. Her child is under 18 living in her house. She has an equal say to her husband in the rules regarding other children under 18 sleeping in her house. \n\nAgain, the merits of each argument are less important than lying and deceiving and going behind her back, which is a direct violation of trust. Even if husbands intentions were amazingly good. You don\u2019t lie or go behind your partner\u2019s back. That is objectively a violation of trust.", "Yes???? Because he wouldn't be attracted to them? Him being gay he'd be able to have female friends over no issue. How do you not understand this?", "According to the post, it is not an agreement. They are disagreeing. And the OP responded saying it\u2019s a moral issue in the part of the wife, not a legal. Ergo, as a gay man myself, it\u2019s a stupid reason. My dad displayed some homophobia to me at that age for moral reasons and it damaged our relationship needlessly.", "So he's attracted to all males, got it.", "Ok I see what you are saying. Relationship-wise, bad on OP. Moral-wise, OP chose to harm their trust with his wife to side with what he thought was right.", "Yes", "Why are you being so intentionally dense about this? If he was straight he wouldn\u2019t be allowed to have girls sleep over. That doesn\u2019t mean he would want to have sex with any and all girls. He\u2019s gay so he\u2019s not allowed to have boys sleep over. That also doesn\u2019t mean he wants to have sex with any and all boys.", "He's attracted to males in the same way a straight guy is attracted to females, hence the rules apply", "Bad for his relationship with his wife, probably good for his relationship with his son. My dad liked choosing his morality over our relationship, and it wasn\u2019t great for him."]}
