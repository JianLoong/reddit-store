Total of 6 siblings and we are all semi close to each-other. \nOf course because of the age difference I\u2019m not as close to him and my older siblings but they are all very close to our parents. Whenever my siblings dated someone they wouldn\u2019t make it a huge thing until it was someone they were serious with. \nWin told us he\u2019s dating a girl and didn\u2019t really tell us anything more. He\u2019s been with Dela (24f) for at least a year now. He asked to move back in with my parents because he was struggling money wise. So Dela would come around but only at night. He never really introduced her to us and even my parents would ask about her. He would keep his dating life pretty private so we all respected it and didn\u2019t push him further for details. I personally only interacted with her 1 time and that was to let her in the house because he fell asleep. So fast forward about 7-8 months , he tells us he\u2019s moving out again but that he has something to tell us. That\u2019s he\u2019s expecting a baby with Dela and she\u2019s gonna give birth in a month. We were all shocked and super confused. We asked about baby showers and all the other baby preparations and he told us they already held a baby shower. My mom was in shock for a bit because this is the first grandkid. We all congratulated him and well he just left. He didn\u2019t really talk to us unless we reached out to visit the both of them. So now the baby is here and well no one\u2019s really jumping to help him. He\u2019s upset that we aren\u2019t invested or are jumping to see the baby or his gf. He was ranting to me how everyone\u2019s heartless and I got upset with him. I told him that it\u2019s his fault none of us know his partner or even the baby. That he never included us and it\u2019s beyond fucked up that hes the one upset. He called me a brat and pretty much ghosted everyone. My moms really heart broken and I might\u2019ve fucked up by blowing up on him\u2026.

If he's too clueless to see you are right, then he's likely too clueless to change his behavior. As such, he'll just keep stringing you all along expecting you to reach out to him and acting like a spoiled brat when you don't bend over backwards for him. It's sad about your mom being upset about the first grandchild, but that isn't your fault at all. It's literally all the fault of your brother and his idiot gf.", "NTA - you may be 15 but he's the one acting 15", "NTA\n\nHe used your parents, refused to establish a relationship with them or let his family get to know his partner.\n\nNeglected to inform them until the last moment his partner was pregnant.\n\nMoved out without notice.\n\nComplained that his family now aren't helping him and pretty much a stranger.\n\nAnd now is avoiding those who he's complaining about.\n\nThis is his own doing.

He seems selfish and oddly private. I wonder if his gf is in charge. I mean, why not throw 2 baby showers if she wanted one just for her family?", "NTA, but I would definitely try to patch things up with Win if you can.

If he's gonna be secretive he can raise his own family.", "Nta", "Your brother is delulu", "NTA. Your brother set the tone of the relationship between his family and yours. He didn't want you to know or be involved with them. You and the rest of the family have followed his lead and respected his wishes. He doesn't get to have it both ways.", "Wtf this is weird, NTA", "NTA - he wanted to have his cake and eat it too. It's not your guys fault that you didn't know he wanted help considering he never made the effort of introducing his GF to the family, letting his parents know they were serious, or the most important fact of her being pregnant until she was basically due.", "He\u2019s more upset that no one\u2019s offered to step up to help. He thinks it\u2019s insane that no one\u2019s giving him money or just overall attention. Don\u2019t get me wrong we went to to see the momma and baby. As well as bring* her food for the first week.

HE is the one who caused your mother's heartbreak and HE is the one who has to fix it.  \n\nNTA.

He is 100% responsible.", "I\u2019m pretty sure something else is going on because this is like a huge life mile stone and out of all my siblings my parents have always made his achievements the most important.So it\u2019s not like he has bad blood with my parents/family.", "We were kind of chill about it but one of my brothers found out via social media that she had two baby showers. One for their friends and then one for her family. So some of my siblings including me are pretty hurt over it.", "Yeah my older sister is saying that 2. He\u2019s normally pretty chill and it\u2019s just so out of blue that he pulled something like this. I will patch things up and apologize because I\u2019m pretty sure is very stressed out now since he\u2019s a father now.", "Well next time you bring it up make sure you tell him that he\u2019s the one who set this tone. You had your girlfriend come over at night like some mistress, never brung her around to truly meet or spend time with your family, and then basically downplayed her pregnancy. He made it seem like it was no big deal so that\u2019s what it kinda is. The audacity to feel offended imagine your family must feel! Your mom is probably so heartbroken out on missing that chapter with her son. He needs to check himself.", "Lol give him money?!  \ud83d\ude02. What the heck for?!  Because he procreated?!  Pfffft!  Be glad he\u2019s not contact!", "It has to be something.  Good luck with this, I hope ya'll figure out what's wrong with your brother.", "Uh yeah. Your mom should have at least been invited. He\u2019s so quick to toss y\u2019all aside until he needs something.", "The baby is t his sister.", "NTA. You can keep your family at arms length, keeping them in the dark about such important things and then expect them to be at your Beck and call. Unless there\u2019s a reason for his attitude it just screams immaturity.

His behavior, while puzzling and seemingly out of character, is still on him. There may be more between your parents and your brother. You would not be wrong for trying to repair your relationship.

He just wants money", "You barely know his baby mama and he never had her properly spend time with your family, or let you know she was pregnant until the last minute. Why would he expect anything when you have no relationship with her?", "Tell him he either wants privacy or a close relationship with the family. Until now he asked for the first with the consequences that none of you are invested/close with his partner and baby. If he wants help then HE needs to change to option 2 , introduce you all to his partner to get to know her and THEN you will help.\n\nNTA", "I would argue both he and Delia are at fault.

Hard doubt on this claim", "Brung (autocheck changed it to bring)", "well, it\u2019s a non-standard word but everyone understands that it means \u2018brought\u2019.
