The winners of the comment awards will be awarded a Mod Award as well. Various runners up will win awards as well.\n\n## Award Categories\n\n### Post Awards\n\n* Best post\n* Biggest asshole\n* Most sympathetic asshole\n* **[Best post involving food](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1041d6p/aita_best_of_2022_best_post_involving_food)** - posted 1/5/23, closing 1/25/23\n* Most difficult decision to make\n* Most wholesome post\n\n### Comment Awards\n\n\n* Most helpful comment\n* Most empathetic YTA comment\n* Best ESH comment\n* Best NAH comment\n* Funniest comment\n* Most persuasive comment\n\n### Awards Process\n\nThis year we\u2019re shaking things up a bit, but hopefully the format will be familiar to everyone. This is our master post, where we\u2019ll link the thread for each of the 12 categories. A new thread will go up daily and be open for 2 weeks. Each thread will be for both nominations and voting.\n\nTo nominate a post or comment, simply make a top-level comment with the link to the comment. To vote on your favorite, simply upvote the top-level comment that contains the link. We\u2019ll keep contest mode on for the entire 2 weeks to keep things as fair as possible, so make sure that you pay attention and read through the threads so you\u2019re not making a duplicate nomination. Note that any post that was removed or any OP who was banned or suspended will not be eligible to win. Any nominations for such posts, or any nominations for non-2022 posts, will be removed.\n\nAt the end of 2 weeks the threads will be locked and contest mode will be turned off, at which point we\u2019ll crown our winners and hand out awards.\n\n# Good luck assholes, and remember that Rule 1 still applies!", "created_utc": 1672931464, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1041a4g/aita_best_of_2022_masster_post/", "score": 88, "replies": ["[Best post involving food](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1041d6p/aita_best_of_2022_best_post_involving_food)", "Hardest decision!
