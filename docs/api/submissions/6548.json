The winners of the comment awards will be awarded a Mod Award as well.

This is our master post, where we\u2019ll link the thread for each of the 12 categories. A new thread will go up daily and be open for 2 weeks. Each thread will be for both nominations and voting.\n\nTo nominate a post or comment, simply make a top-level comment with the link to the comment. To vote on your favorite, simply upvote the top-level comment that contains the link. We\u2019ll keep contest mode on for the entire 2 weeks to keep things as fair as possible, so make sure that you pay attention and read through the threads so you\u2019re not making a duplicate nomination. Note that any post that was removed or any OP who was banned or suspended will not be eligible to win. Any nominations for such posts, or any nominations for non-2022 posts, will be removed.\n\nAt the end of 2 weeks the threads will be locked and contest mode will be turned off, at which point we\u2019ll crown our winners and hand out awards.\n\n# Good luck assholes, and remember that Rule 1 still applies!", "created_utc": 1672931464, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1041a4g/aita_best_of_2022_masster_post/", "score": 169, "replies": ["[Best post involving food](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1041d6p/aita_best_of_2022_best_post_involving_food)", "Hardest decision!

They all look down on me and my family.\n\nMy sister and her husband have excommunicated me and my children from our whole family because of a harmless prank my daughter pulled on my father. My sister told me never to contact her again so I haven't.\n\nMy mom was spending Xmas with my family this year and suddenly fell ill. I don't want to get into detail about it but she passed Monday night.\n\nMy sister found out on Tuesday and has raised holy hell about it even though I respected her wishes not to contact her \"under any circumstances\" \u2014 her words.\n\nNow my sister is refusing to talk to me even though I need to speak to her about our mother's will since she is the executor. My husband and kids are standing by my side but my nieces and nephews have broken their vow of silence to call me and tell me I'm a \"shit person\" even though I tried my best to respect my sister's wishes even when I disagreed with them.
