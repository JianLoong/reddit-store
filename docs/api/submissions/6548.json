This is our master post, where we\u2019ll link the thread for each of the 12 categories. A new thread will go up daily and be open for 2 weeks. Each thread will be for both nominations and voting.\n\nTo nominate a post or comment, simply make a top-level comment with the link to the comment. To vote on your favorite, simply upvote the top-level comment that contains the link. We\u2019ll keep contest mode on for the entire 2 weeks to keep things as fair as possible, so make sure that you pay attention and read through the threads so you\u2019re not making a duplicate nomination.\n\nAt the end of 2 weeks the threads will be locked and contest mode will be turned off, at which point we\u2019ll crown our winners and hand out awards.\n\n# Good luck assholes, and remember that Rule 1 still applies!", "created_utc": 1672931464, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1041a4g/aita_best_of_2022_masster_post/", "score": 24, "replies": ["[Best post involving food](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1041d6p/aita_best_of_2022_best_post_involving_food)", "Hardest decision!
