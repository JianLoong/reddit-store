My mom is not a good grandmother and it is a sore subject for both my wife and mother.\n\nThe other day my mom called and said she was in the neighborhood and her husband wants his golf clubs back. I did not want to deal with her husband so I told her to come get them. We were having a family birthday party for my son, so I waited at the door so I wouldn't have to invite her in. \n\nI'm assuming my mom forgot my son's birthday. I don't think she actually knows either of the kids birthdays, but if someone reminds her she will give them money. So she stopped by to get the clubs and I told her we were entertaining and tried to hurry her out. \n\nMy wife called my mom's name from upstairs, so my mom went up and I knew it wasn't going to be pretty. My wife claimed she had a question for my mom (really unimportant question, think some gossip she heard and didn't actually need an answer to) Then she asked if my mom wanted any cake. My mom didn't seem to realize it was a birthday party and said yes.\n\nI saw my wife and MIL smirking at each other, and my wife asked my son to give my mom three guesses about why they were having cake. My mom guessed wrong each time and the closest she got was asking if it was MIL or FIL's birthday. My wife told my son he was allowed to spray my mom with the silly string, but he ran off.\n\nMy wife was like do you know why you deserved to be sprayed? At this point my mom seemed annoyed and I tried to diffuse, but my wife told her it was his birthday and MIL and FIL began laughing, and making jokes about how my mom probably doesn't forget her hair appointments but doesn't know her own grandsons birthday. MIL even made a joke about my mom having a good memory because she seemed to know the name of every guy she was fucking after the divorce (no kids in the room at this point)\n\nMy mom's husband turned to me and asked if I was going to let them speak to her like that. I said yes. I even admitted I knew they were being catty, but said she is the one who doesn't know family birthday. My mom told me I was a pussy and should stand up for her, so I kicked her out for name calling. Now my family is saying I'm an asshole and I should be more protective of my mom and care when she's being \"bullied\" I do love my mom, but I feel like she is the one who doesn't even know her grandkids birthdays.", "created_utc": 1670017115, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zaykxq/aita_for_not_defending_my_mom_after_my_wife/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

While it's sad that your mom isn't trying to take an active role in your kids lives, she isn't obligated to. Would it be nice if she remembered birthdays and dates? of course.

Not only did your wife behave this way, but also for her parents to be so openly disrespectful and cruel to your mom? Look, I don't know the whole story, I'm sure your mom isn't a saint either, but they were going out of their way to be hurtful/cruel to her, and you stood by. That doesn't make you a saint either. You guys took what could have just been a quick pick up of some golf clubs, and instead created an opportunity to slut-shame and embarrass your mother.\n4.

I did not want to deal with her husband so I told her to come get them. We were having a family birthday party for my son, so I waited at the door so I wouldn't have to invite her in. \n\nI'm assuming my mom forgot my son's birthday. I don't think she actually knows either of the kids birthdays, but if someone reminds her she will give them money. So she stopped by to get the clubs and I told her we were entertaining and tried to hurry her out. \n\nMy wife called my mom's name from upstairs, so my mom went up and I knew it wasn't going to be pretty. My wife claimed she had a question for my mom (really unimportant question, think some gossip she heard and didn't actually need an answer to) Then she asked if my mom wanted any cake. My mom didn't seem to realize it was a birthday party and said yes.\n\nI saw my wife and MIL smirking at each other, and my wife asked my son to give my mom three guesses about why they were having cake. My mom guessed wrong each time and the closest she got was asking if it was MIL or FIL's birthday. My wife told my son he was allowed to spray my mom with the silly string, but he ran off.\n\nMy wife was like do you know why you deserved to be sprayed? At this point my mom seemed annoyed and I tried to diffuse, but my wife told her it was his birthday and MIL and FIL began laughing, and making jokes about how my mom probably doesn't forget her hair appointments but doesn't know her own grandsons birthday. MIL even made a joke about my mom having a good memory because she seemed to know the name of every guy she was fucking after the divorce (no kids in the room at this point)\n\nMy mom's husband turned to me and asked if I was going to let them speak to her like that. I said yes. I even admitted I knew they were being catty, but said she is the one who doesn't know family birthday. My mom told me I was a pussy and should stand up for her, so I kicked her out for name calling. Now my family is saying I'm an asshole and I should be more protective of my mom and care when she's being \"bullied\" I do love my mom, but I feel like she is the one who doesn't even know her grandkids birthdays.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
