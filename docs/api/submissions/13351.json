It is otherwise a plain, loose, Henley style long sleeve. Yes, it\u2019s a tiny bit see through because it\u2019s white, I mean you really have to look for it. I also hate bras. And am lucky enough not to need them. So I go braless with that shirt today, I am totally comfortable with the level of see through it is. \n\nMy boyfriend (M29)sees me wearing it on the way to run errands and following convo follows:\nBF: that shirt is see through\nME: yeah it is a tiny bit, no big deal\nBF: you\u2019re going to wear that to run errands?\nME: yes\nBF: are you looking for a new bf or something? (Kind of jokingly but not really)\nME: ???\nBF: well girls who seek attention wear stuff like that out\nME: not sure if you\u2019re joking or not right now\nBF: \u2026\n*I leave to run errands without changing*\n\nBoyfriend and I have been together for 5 years. Live together, have pets together. I am not looking for a new boyfriend and am not seeking anyone else\u2019s attention and he\u2019s fully aware so his comments were irrational in my opinion. Since I got back, there\u2019s tension. So AITA for wearing a shirt my bf did not \u201capprove of\u201d?\n\nEDIT: in a totally Redditesque manner, what started out as people giving a good mixed bag of opinions is now a train that\u2019s fully left the tracks. I guess I better explain this side story. \n\nI made a post on AITA a couple of days ago. In summary, I talked to a guy at a bar on a night out with some friends. What in my mind was an innocent discussion about chess of all things, a mutual hobby of ours, he eventually ended up asking for my number. I immediately told him at that point I have a bf and will not be giving him any way of contacting me. Mentioning my bf prior to that point seemed very \u201ci have a boyfriend\u201d \u201cokay cool no one asked\u201d. So I posted on AITA essentially asking if I led the guy on in some way although I was simply being friendly. This was so not AITA that the mods ended up removing the post and directed me to another more appropriate sub. But I guess some people saw it before it got taken down and one of them commented on here saying something like \u201coh weren\u2019t you just lying to some guy you\u2019ve been hanging out all day with about having a bf just the other day\u201d. Worded in a way that completely changed the context and even the duration of the original interaction. So now I\u2019m the AH in one of the top comments because they changed their mind based on this post they never even read themselves, just saw a comment about. And I wasn\u2019t even the AH in the post in question lol the irony. \n\nI hope after this clarification we can get back to the essence of the question, but looks like we\u2019re too far gone friends. \n\nNot to mention I already got plenty of opinions, and contrary to popular belief, in spite of me sticking to my original stance, which is I wear what I like, seeing some other angles helped me see better from my partners perspective and will certainly help with communicating and even compromising. So thank you all for this fun ride.", "created_utc": 1679949066, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/123zdc5/aita_for_wearing_a_shirt_my_boyfriend_finds_too/", "score": 407, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
