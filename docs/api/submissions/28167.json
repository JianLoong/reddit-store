Immediately changes it. \"Gee, I don't know why it's not working. Have you tried turning your (phone, computer, TV) off and back on?\"", "Because knowing the sites you visit can help recon and other attacks that can be used to steal your identity. It can also help attackers set up Man in the middle attacks for vulnerable connections thereby risking credential theft and other types of malicious activity. You can also exploit weaknesses in devices on the network... However you would be right to say that using the network to host malicious services would be by far the easiest opportunity and perhaps the biggest risk?", "Ehhh I think network traffic isn't a huge concern as far as an attack vector goes. Also really only slightly a vector for wireless traffic, not like wifi password suddenly gives you a network tap. Exploiting devices has nothing to do with capturing network traffic. Vuln scanners are active scans hitting all the IPs in a network to discover the devices. That is a bigger attack vector than network traffic for sure. But still pretty low if shit is updated. You could say stupid internet connected devices might be exploitable but there is a good chance those could just be exposed on Shodan anyway.\n\nThe biggest risk is probably people re-using their wifi password throughout the network which would give someone access to something they shouldn't. The likelihood someone with the expertise to do all this stuff, and want to do this stuff, isn't going to target shitty target that they are directly connected to lol."]}
