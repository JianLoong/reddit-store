They are street parking in front of their home because they do not have their own parking space. Basically, someone could park in front of their home, and they couldn't do or say anything because they didn't have rights to the space.\n\nSure, this opinion is stupid, but not because it's \"their property.\"", "Except that street parking is not your own property.  I get why OP doesn't want to have to move further down the street but people who think the street in front of their property is the same as being part of the property are acting entitled as well.", "Where I live the street is city property", "The sister wanted her parents to pay to fix the driveway", "or because she is an Ah?", "Exactly what I was thinking, If she made all those snarky comments on the internet i can\u2019t imagine what she would say to her.", "The question remains: have people forgotten how to be nice? \n\nIs not about who is RIGHT or not, is just being nice, jeez!", "It isn\u2019t down the street though. It\u2019s a few feet.", "Yeah, I\u2019m not getting that logic of OP being nice and parking further down instead of right in front of their home, just so next door neighbor doesn\u2019t have to be inconvenienced.", "She was the one who cut contact, not them.", "We had a dip in our driveway. $30 worth of Quikrete later, we no longer had a dip. Problem solved.", "Yeah but a temporary fix of filling her pothole with gravel would be cheap and prevent her from damaging her car. It would be sufficient while she saves for a more permanent fix.", "She might saving up. But in the meantime, what\u2019s stopping her from parking in the vacant space she\u2019s asking OP to move to?", "She doesn\u2019t have to pay a mortgage, she can afford it", "So....she parks on the street.", "Worst case fill it with gravel so it isn\u2019t a hole. It would look good but it\u2019s better for your car.", "She has a free house, if she can't afford to maintain her property then she has some serious money management issues.", "That is her problem not OP's!", "No information was given why their relationship was estranged. Now of course OP wouldnt offer up information that makes herself look bad or she doesn't even realize she did an Asshole thing somewhere along the way. So whether the stepsis is fed up with OP or just anti-social, neither gives OP the right to feel entitled to be close with her.  \n\nThere are very little information given here but OP sounds petty with the snarky comment. She sounds entitled and holding a grudge because she was cut off contact with. She is unwilling to comply with a insignificant thing to make others live easier... Probably because of the grudge and is intentionally trying to \"get back\" at her.", "It'd be really nice of you to give me $100.", "Again, why do I need to inconvenience myself because my neighbor can\u2019t take care of their property? Maybe she can just park in OPs yard, that would be nice of them.", "Who cares? Fix your driveway if you can\u2019t use it.", "Mortgage and house maintenance aren't the samething. She might not have a mortgage but there are still other expenses to house ownership. That being said I don't understand why the step sister won't park where there's free space. It's not that big of a deal.", "Yup ! Exactly", "They don't need to but they sound pretty snarky.", "Because it would be, you know, nice.", ">Mortgage and house maintenance aren't the samething. She might not have a mortgage but there are still other expenses to house ownership.\n\nNo shit, but if she doesn't have a mortgage she should have significantly more money available for maintenance. If she can't put money aside every month, even half of what her mortgage would have been, for maintenance costs, that's on her."]}
