He isn\u2019t naming his child after you.  Make that clear, he just likes that name and isn\u2019t apart of you.  End of subject.  His right to pick any name and your right to clarify.  He\u2019s being a dick, btw.  But do it with a smile.  \u201cOh no, she\u2019s not named after me,  but she is darling!l\u201d. Let him explain it, if he keeps saying she\u2019s named after you.", "NTA but your brother is.\nThe point of naming children after family members is to honor those relatives.\nIf he insists on using your deadname which clearly does not make you feel honored, and is in fact distressing you then ask him what's the point of using that name.", "NTA\n\nIf he wants to name his daughter after you, he should use a feminine form of your name, not your deadname.", "Nta, if he wants to honor you, the closest feminine form of your chosen name would suffice. Using your deadname is disrespectful AF, so disrespectful that I can't image he doesn't know that. Is he otherwise respectful of your transition/ identity? If I were you I'd be furious. This would be a full on, no-contact deal breaker for me. \nHe can name his kid whatever he wants, and if it just happened to be a pleasant name he liked it would be less of an issue, but the intentional disrespect of using your dead name is hard to overlook. That being said, sometimes straight cis people just struggle to understand why things they do and say cause pain, because they have no reference point for it. He might not intentionally be trying to hurt you, but this is also beyond careless. Try suggesting the best  feminine forms of your chosen name. If he shoots that down, he's disrespecting your identity on purpose.", "NTA\n\nHe's not naming the daughter after you, but after a person that never really was. Beyond that, using your deadname is disrespectful and rude.", "NTA. He wouldn't be naming her after *you*, he'd be naming her after something that happened long ago and has no current relevance. It would be unfair to you for him to explain how she got her name to someone, and disrespecting you every time he did. Not to mention how it will feel for his daughter when she is old enough to understand.", "NTA, but I really don't know what you can do about it.  Maybe if he'd just say it's a \"family name\" and not specifically your deadname.", "Well you don\u2019t get a say over what people name their child. You can always just not be around them.", "My kiddos know who they are named after. One is after my husband\u2019s favorite aunt. Our second is named after my grandmother. (Although we did \u201clie\u201d to my MIL and tell her she was named after her rofl. She drew a conclusion\u2026we didn\u2019t tell her this. It was more of a \u201coh you named her Louise after me! When her name was Lou. That is so amazing and special. I can\u2019t thank you enough.\u201d We just smiled and rolled with it.) Here is the thing\u2026if the kiddo brings it up to you or someone else does\u2026just act confused and be all \u201cit\u2019s funny bc brother knows that\u2019s not my name. Kinda silly if you think about it.\u201d", "This is a tough one. On one hand he can name his kid whatever he wants and its none of your business. On the other he specifically said he'd be naming her after you when that's not your name.\n\nIf he just liked the name then I'd say Y T A. As he's allegedly doing it in your honour I'll go with NTA", "Nta. While it\u2019s normally nice when a parent wants to name a child after someone bc they love you\u2026this feels extremely passive aggressive and a screw you. Like he\u2019s trying to make people remember you were born female.", "NTA. I'd probably go no contact if it was me. My sister is trans. I still feel weird when I have to use her deadname to talk to people who have it sometimes (it used to be a lot weirder). I would never use it for a child and if I did have some weird urge to or my partner really liked it, I would ask my sister first and accept whatever answer she gave. \n\nI'm sorry about your brother.", "NTA but you should make it clear to your brother that if he does proceed with the name, he is not in fact naming his daughter after you, because that name was never really you. If he truly respects who you are, he won\u2019t continue to consider his daughter as \u201cnamed after you\u201d after you tell him this. He can say it\u2019s a family name (if you\u2019re okay with that), which isn\u2019t untrue. But it\u2019s not YOU or YOUR name.", "NTA. But your brother isn\u2019t naming his baby after you, that\u2019s not your name and it\u2019s not who you are.", "YTA. Its his child. The name can be whatever. You can say Jessica is your deadname all you want; but the name holds significance to your brother. \n\nLet it go. \n\nBothers you that much? Be the \u201cfamily member we never see\u201d.", "NAH", "you are NOT the asshole! he should not be using your deadname as a \u201ctribute\u201d to you. it\u2019s disrespectful and not who you are anymore. maybe he can feminize your current name for his daughter? meet you halfway? your deadname shouldn\u2019t be an option out of respect for you. he ought to respect your privacy and SAFETY too.", "NTA. IMHO, your brother is the spiteful AH who obviously has issues with your life.. Make sure he knows that you will be sure to explain to your niece what he did.", "NTA. However, there might be a silver lining here (even though your brother is clearly intending to be an AH)? Your deadname will now be linked to/refer to someone else. Since it\u2019s no longer your name and your nieces and nephews don\u2019t know you by that name, I think this will backfire on your brother. People will just be confused when he says he named his child after you.", "I\u2019m so sorry that your brother and mother are acting this disrespectful.  It is not your name therefore he is not \u201chonoring\u201d you and he is way out of line.  \n\nYou are NTA.", "NTA. It's totally reasonable for you not to want to be continually reminded of your deadname: end of discussion.", "Yes. Softly-YTA. You don\u2019t own the name. He gets to use whatever name he and the mother-to-be want. Plus, since it\u2019s not your actual name, he\u2019s not really naming the child after you anyway. The source of the name lasts a few months at best. In a few years, literally no one will connect the name with you. Now if your family members are not using your actual name, then NTA. \n\nThe line is drawn where you get to say that he name is hurtful to you, but you understand that he might have reasons to use it. Then be clear, he can use it if he wants, but as it\u2019s not your name, he\u2019s not actually naming the child after you.", "Just be grateful most people have to die for someone to get named after them he\u2019s just trying to show you in his own way that he loves you", "YTA- he obviously loves you and you may have transitioned but he still remembers the childhood and it sounds like he was a good brother, it probably reminds him of good times. Plus if the sex is opposite of what you identify as, then its gonna be the opposite version no matter what unless you just reject him naming a kid after you. You are making tons of assumptions that revolve around ppl thinking about you, they wont, it will just be a seldom thought about tribute. Just remember in life noone is usually thinking about you they are too busy thinking about their own stuff, but your brother actually is thinking about you and you reject it bc you are way too in your feelings and trying to make everything fit your view.", "what do you care? you aren't using it anymore. however, i would be careful if i were him about naming my child after a mentally unstable person. either way, if anyone asks, he could say he named her after his dead sister", "NAH there\u2019s nothing wrong with you asking your brother not to do this but also he is an adult who can choose any name that he wants. I do understand why you don\u2019t like it but also you can\u2019t control other people, just like you would t like people controlling your choices.", "You\u2019re definitely NTA, but also your brother may love you beyond explanation as to why he wants to name you after another woman in his life that he will truly love unconditionally again.\n\n[edit- grammar]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is basic respect that if you want to name your child after a living relative that you have that relatives blessing.

It's a live and let live situation, IMO.  I think you would understand from that perspective, as isn't that what you want for yourself?", "This is the best way. He likes the name, he can use the name, but he can\u2019t claim he\u2019s naming her after you because that\u2019s not your name", "Huh, I like that approach.", "exactly what I was going to say!", "You\u2019re right, OP doesn\u2019t own the name. \n\nBut it was theirs for 23 years and that\u2019s specifically why brother is calling his daughter this name. Bro has admitted as much, OP has registered his concerns about it and Bro is still determined to turn his new baby girl into a pawn for some sort of transphobic power play. \n\nWhich makes him a double asshole. \n\nThe only way this doesn\u2019t end well for OP is if he\u2019s leaving out crucial information like that he was originally named for their grandmother or something. \n\nIf the deadname came out of a baby name book, then bro can use a variation of his authentic name to honor him, not his deadname to insult him.", "I'm named after my grandfather and uncle. I tell people about this all the time. If was named after a trans relative and they used their deadname to name me, I would have to explain that each time I mentioned who I was named after, or I would have to choose to tell people I wasn't named after anyone to avoid having to go into the whole explanation and outing my trans relative over and over and over.\n\nAnd no, this does not show he loves OP. What it shows is a total lack of respect for OP, when naming a child after OP's deadname. If OP's chosen name is Charles, then niece can be named Charlotte. THAT would be a respectful naming that shows that OP's brother loves them.", "Wtf.", "Except the brother is claiming he's doing it to honor OP. He's not honoring OP if he uses OP's deadname.

This has very little bearing on OP outside of a couple months of new baby ooohhhing and ahhhing. OP isn\u2019t using the name, and OP has complete control of the level of exposure. OP could see the child & Bro as little or as much as is wanted. Yes, bro is not wearing a halo here, but very few people are going to make the connection, and even those that are will see that connection fade quickly. The name will very quickly become solely the child\u2019s even from OP\u2019s perspective. It\u2019s just not this dramatic and when bro is behaving this way, it\u2019s it better to tone it down rather than amping it up? \n\nI guess what I\u2019m trying to say is that it\u2019s not like Bro is going to get to explain to everyone why his child has this name every single time the name is said. The vast majority of people the child will know at even 3-5 years old will not know OP. Family will know and even they will \u201cforget\u201d since OP doesn\u2019t use the name. \n\nI don\u2019t think bro is doing the right thing here, but I just don\u2019t think this is high in the AH list. It\u2019s not a battle I\u2019d pick. How many of us know why the people in our daily interactions got their names? I\u2019m sure we\u2019re talking less than 1%.", "He didn\u2019t say honor. OP didn\u2019t say that in the post.", "Right, it's not to honor him, it's just incredibly dishonorable to do. My bad.\n\nHe's naming the child after OP. OP's name is not the name he is choosing. That's disrespectful, in particular because it's a deadname. If you can't understand that, and still think the brother isn't an asshole for doing this, I don't know what to tell you."]}
