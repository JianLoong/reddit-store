You need to do better for yourself because you appear to be truly miserable.", "Judging by your more recent posts, please for the love of all you hold dear and your own mental/physical/emotional/financial well-being, DUMP THIS MAN. NTA but Y W B T A if you continue letting him pull all this shit despite all the continuous red flags.", "Drinking and cptsd is a bad combination. It\u2019s also called self medicating. OP, please take a good look at your situation, and also look into the difference between enabling and support. \n\nNTA. Protect yourself and your finances. Remember: put your oxygen mask on before you help others.", ">The money he makes alone isn\u2019t enough to support his current spending habits\n\nNot sure if my eyesight is still okay after I rolled my eyes so hard after reading this. Beer and takeout are not necessities and dipping into savings for this is terrible. He needs to get a grip. There is absolutely no need for him to be spending your money that should be going in savings. Even if you have seperate accounts it's gonna be up to you to save any money because he's gonna blow them. Not sure if that's how you wanna live. NTA", "NTA - but op, your post history is quite concerning.  You have endlessly posted about situations where your partner is not taking your feelings into consideration, manipulating you and treating you in really bad ways.  This money issue seems to be just the tip of the iceberg. \n\nWhy are oyu with him?  And I don't mean why can't you break up with him because that's not the same thing.  What does he bring to your life?  Or are you with him because you've just got into a pattern and change feels scary?", "L", "NTA. He should be contributing to bills, not spending all of his money and some of yours! \n\nStop giving this mooch access to your money. \n\nAnd, you know what kind of selfish ah he is, don\u2019t legally tie yourself to him and give him even more access to your property/ assets.", "I drink way too much beer. I drink the cheapest beer I can find and I am spending maybe twenty bucks a week. This is because I don't like wasting my own money on beer.\n\nIf he is really spending more money than he makes on beer then he has a spending issue and does not respect the money that you are bringing in.\n\nNTA\n\nIt sounds reasonable to do what you propose. It also sounds like he just sucks with money  in general.", "Nta. Your fiance needs to sort out his alcoholism, his mental health, his job and his overspending. \n\nDon't marry him. Give him 90 days to get on his feet or move out.\n\nR/alanon", "Exactly of op lost her job there's no way he would help at all", "The post history is heartbreaking. And I love how he wants to be poly but is threatened by her other partner. Dude sounds awful, and probably really manipulative to keep OP hooked like this.\n\nOP - you're entitled to the money you earn. He is not entitled to indulge in beer and food delivery on your back.", "This is the way. There is a long trail of marinara flags leading to this point. He sounds very selfish and you sound like you need to focus on yourself and figuring out how to heal some of your own traumas so you can navigate life a little more easily. \n\nNTA", "Exactly why would you share money with a roomate?!", "I've been going through the entire post history for the last 30 min or so and OMG! I lack words to say to OP except I wish you the best OP and YWNBTA at all!!", "That's what we do - I have one account that is purely for bills. Husband pays in a set amount each month. I pay for all the other stuff like food, pets, toiletries etc. It works out roughly equal.\n\nWe each keep the rest of our money in our own accounts. If one is struggling for any reason we help each other, and if there's an unexpected bill like say the washing machine goes kaput, we sort it between us, but otherwise we keep personal spending separate.\n\nThis was largely because we both had expensive hobbies when we married - he's an angler, I kept horses - and for example I needed office clothes whereas be got free uniform, so it just seemed fairer to each be in charge of our own needs and wants.\n\nNow 30 years in and still works for us.", "This was my thought too. And don't marry him if he won't get his spending and budgeting under control. Make taking a financial budgeting course and sticking to it a condition of marriage.", "Caveat that if he does most of the homemaking it\u2019s a slightly different (but not hugely different) conversation.", "Medication yes, he\u2019s been on anti-depressants for a while. He was in therapy a while ago, but he can\u2019t currently afford it", "Even if he\u2019s working, he\u2019s not behaving responsibly. First of all, if he\u2019s spending more than 20-30 hours per week minimum wage on takeout and beer, that\u2019s crazy! Second he shouldn\u2019t need you to tell him to cut back since he\u2019s not earning much. It\u2019s a big red flag that he\u2019s unwilling to live within his own means. Definitely delay or reconsider the marriage before you become financially entangled with him!", "Whybare you paying any of your roomates bills?", "Even after marriage! Always have your, mine, and ours accounts.", "And alcoholism is expensive af as their tolerance increases. My mom went through a substantial inheritance in a matter of months. \n\nIt made me livid because her mother (a sahm who never learned to drive) was nonetheless ready to take four young kids and leave my grandpa if he hadn't sobered up, so I know that it would have hurt grammy to know what it was spent on.", "Alcohol is a depressant. My mom finished drinking herself to death this fall and this is how it started. Nothing we tried to support her ever worked because she was a narcissist who wasn't willing to do any inner work/accountability, so I'm not saying that your partner is doomed to be the same, but it's very worrying that he's spending more than he's bringing in and refusing to work with you to address it. The alcohol consumption is actively worsening his mental state.", "This. He needs to become the ex-fiance quickly."]}
