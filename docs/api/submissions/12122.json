Whatever works for you two. You\u2019re right, something has to change. His spending is out of control. If he\u2019s taking advantage of your income by not feeling the need to bring home bacon and further you two financially as a team\u2026issue.

And paying all the bills until he gets on his feet is the right thing to do a team.", "NTA, but please think long and hard about if this is the kind of marriage you\u2019re signing up for. He\u2019s put you in a position where it would be cheaper for you to pay all the bills because he refuses to even have a conversation about budgeting. This isn\u2019t the sort of issue that gets better long term.", "NTA but get unengaged. Someone who refuses to budget isn't someone you want to get married to.

It may work as a hard reset but he can easily play the victim and say you're treating him like a child.

Split the savings too.", "NTA. This sounds like a solid solution. \n\nBut also, do not move forward with marriage plans if this man is someone you have to keep on a financial leash. \n\nI strongly suspect that he'll throw a gigantic tantrum over this. That would be consistent with his current behavior of refusing to be responsible. \n\nBut only you know if this is a temporary behavior change, or his usual behavior. If this is unusual for him, that's one thing. \n\nBut how are you going to have kids with a man who is already acting like a child?", "NTA - Combining bank accounts doesn't mean you have to fully combine bank accounts. You both need a personal bank account, and also a shared account. Both put your money into the shared account, and then have an automatic transfer to your personal accounts that is your personal spending money every however often. Any time money comes out of that shared account is only for bills/groceries/needs, and you can set it up so withdrawals/transfers require both people to sign off.", "NTA. Good idea.

Just do it. You've talked to him about it, but since your behavior never changed, his hasn't either. Stop your direct deposit into the shared account and re-establish your own accounts. Always keep your finances separate. He will be furious that the money river has dried up, but that's okay. If he can't or more honestly won't change his spending habits, this is what you should expect from married life. Only then, you'll have to pay alimony when it breaks down.", "Nta", "NTA. You need to have a serious conversation with him before you get married. If his drinking is a concern, this isn\u2019t something to sweep under the rug and assume it\u2019ll just get better. There\u2019s obviously multiple issues here. One is his drinking. Two is your finances. And Three is you both need to iron a lot of things out before getting married. I would suggest couples counseling before you marry him. \n\nRegarding your finances, I would keep it separate until you get married. You need a (separate) savings account that he doesn\u2019t know about - I know this is t the advice everyone will agree with, but I say this because you\u2019re not married and because he\u2019s drinking a lot.

You never ever ever share a bank account to which the paycheck comes in. You put in equal for the bills and stuff and whatever you spend on yourself like beer or takeaways its better coming out of your personal account. Else both of you are going to end up broke and what if the relationship breaks up under the financial stress. Money is one of those things that splits people very fast. Its most definitely the time to take back control and as long as you feed him money, he's going to enjoy spending it.

I have no idea why would you want to marry, this marriage won't keep your spouse home. \n\nIt's hell to be alone in a relationship. \n\nThink about it.

He doesn't respect your wishes and i am afraid he doesn't love you. \n\nAlso i wouldn't share my account with my spouse. Yes, after marriage we shared paswords, but we don't spend money we don't have. \n\nCut his access to your money, at least... And think about the rest. Are you happy? Do you feel loved?

He's gotten used to snacking and drinking, and not working. You could have a potential mooching freeloader in the making.

If he doesn\u2019t have enough money to support his drinking habit and can\u2019t access your money to make up the difference, he can start taking out credit cards and racking up debt. There are a lot of financially damaging things that he can do without having money, and once you\u2019re married, bankruptcy would kill your credit along with his.  There only ways to make sure he doesn\u2019t drag you down with him are either to have him sign a prenup or to hold off on marrying him until he can pull it together.

The books that count the most are how money is handled, whether or not to have kids, and the basic roles of each spouse (re: \"gender roles\"). Being on the same page means being ready for these things; being in the same book means you agree on their importance and how they should be handled on a fundamental level. \n\nIf you aren't in the same book (agreeing how money is handled and what to do about budgeting and when times are tight), it will fundamentally lead to dissatisfaction and discord in the long run. \n\nI'd suggest you guys have a couple of sessions with a therapist to find out if you are in the same books.
