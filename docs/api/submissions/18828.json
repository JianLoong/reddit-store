Most of her roles (bar one where she's the main villain of a movie) were mainly as a pleasant,polite, wholesome woman/girl. Some of her roles had her as really in tune with nature and loving animals. In one of her movies, she's anti hunting and has a little speech to another character how she doesn't want her son raised in a world where violence is normalized (like with hunting). I really liked her in that movie and I also like sorta digging into her past and finding out new stuff about her like articles and interviews, she wasn't really famous as an actress but she did have some significant roles and I like learning more in my spare time.\n\nI found an old article from the late 1960s when she was 14 or 15 about how she was starting modeling and talking about her aspirations to be an actress. In the article the bit that has stuck with me was this part where it said she loves hunting foxes with her Dad. It was accompanied by 2 photos of her. One of her in a forest with a hunting rifle presumably tracking a fox and the other was a photo of her with a full smile with the rifle in her hands. This really caught off me left field and I was genuinely just shocked. She's never told me about this and I could have never expected it.\n\nI decided to phone her about it. I mentioned finding the article which she was very positive in response too. Then I mentioned the hunting photos and she was really dismissive about it, not apologetic at all. I asked her does she not feel guilty about it or embarrassed and she just shrugged it off saying it was a long time ago and she's obviously not a poacher. I replied how shocked I was over this especially with how most of her roles depict her and I was a little cross about it. She got defensive and made this remark trying to say I'm being sexist because I'm shocked she wasn't doing typical English girl stuff in the 1960s and I should grow up. I responded saying \"I doubt many kids in the 1960s were hunting foxes\". She signed and gave a quick goodbye and hung up.\n\nAm I in the wrong for being upset about this?", "created_utc": 1685739684, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13yp23g/aita_for_being_upset_at_my_mum_over_an_article/", "score": 170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because you looked at her acting roles and presumed that must be how she is irl. It\u2019s called acting for a reason. Why are you getting mad at her for having hobbies that differ from her roles?", "YTA. What are you even upset about?\n\nOh no! Your mom existed as a person with a full life and hobbies before you came along?\n\nShe changed her mind on something from when she was a freakin teenager. Get over it.", "YTA and I hate to be the one to break this to you, but your mom was an actress.  Actors read from a script.  The words they say and the actions they make on screen are not their personalities.  If your mom hunted in her past and never mentioned it, it's likely because she moved on from that part of her past and it simply is not important to her.  I actually feel bad for your poor mother who raised a child incapable of distinguishing between reality and make-believe.", "YTA. You\u2019re really gonna pick a fight w/ your mom about this, something that happened 50+ years ago when societal norms were completely different (AND while she was a young teen, at that)? Ugh\u2026get over yourself. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\udc4e", "YTA\n\nAnimal lover here, but OMG, your mom was a teen! Let it go. English girls -- fox hunting was a norm.

You are judging the CHILD (only 14)  your mother was at a completely different era of time both in her growth and in societies. Above all though She doesn't owe you an explanation or an apology for your sanctimonious and judgemental opinion of her past life not meeting your idea of some makebelieve image that you think she should have. Get over yourself.", "YTA.  She was a child (and thus easily influenced by her parents beliefs and activities) and it was a long time ago.  You also seem astounded that an actor could actually, you know, act in a role and portray people that aren't exactly like them.", "YTA for judging your mother for statements she made in her early teens (about something she was raised to view as normal) and childhood experiences she had.", "YTA, she was 15! You're upset that your mum didn't share values of the characters she played! You're being ridiculous.", "Hahaha, yes YTA. Are you kidding me. Being angry about something that happened over 60 years ago, when she was barely old enough to think for herself. Absolute joke.", "YTA. She was a child at the time. She was probably following her parents beliefs. She\u2019s an adult now and she\u2019s grown. When you know better, you do better.", "Yeah.. YTA. Why are you mad at your mother who did something that 60 years carried different connotations to the same act 60 years later? Do think that in 60 years it will be fair for your kids to judge you on something that you did today that is socially unacceptable in the future?", "Yta. She was 14-15, like let it go. I actually had to go back and double-check your age because you sound like you have some growing up to do still. Do some deeper thinking rather than having your initial feelings control you.", "YTA. Your mom did some shit as a teenager with her family over 60 years ago . . . that she grew out of in the years since. Come back here in 60 years and tell us how you're exactly the same person as you are now.", "YTA, why does it matter so much what she did at 14? And why do you think she should be ashamed/feel guilty, and are disappointed she isn't? \n\nAnd just for the record - you know that roles are just that... roles, and have absolutely nothing to do with the person's REAL feelings/persona, do you? The sweetest actress can play a vilain, and a mean girl can play a saint, and it means ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.", "YTA. Omg that was over 50 years ago, leave the woman alone, she was a teen bonding with your grandpa.", "YTA, she was a kid and that was 60 years ago. Grow up.", "YTA\n\ngrow up", "YTA ffs she had a life before she was mom", "YTA. \n\nHunting was and still is a dear hobby for many.", "YTA a different lifetime, long removed. Dredging up a past that didn't even include you is silly and out of place. \n\nIf you WANT to hold the past against her, at least make it relevant to YOU. This isn't. You weren't born, qnd this has nothing to do with you. If anything, you owe her an apology for making an issue of something unrelated to you at all.", "YTA. Lmao This has nothing to do with you you\u2019re starting a fight with your mom about some thing from 50+ years ago in what world do you actually think the right thing to do is call your mom and give her shit about some thing from when she was a kid?", "YTA big time.  Hunting isn't your thing which is your prerogative but it was an activity that your mom had with her father.  You are transferring yours and maybe today's beliefs to something in the past, in this case the 1960's.  Different timeframes, different thought process, and different activities that your judging.  Your mom has every right to look back at it fondly.  Stop being the all high and mighty with your perspective, it's going to be different than your moms.  It's okay to have your views but your pushing them on your mother from an activity 60 years ago.   What's important is not to cast shock/dispersion over history but to learn from it and make your own decisions.  Also, your mom is correct, grow the hell up and I bet you wouldn't like any of your offspring to cast the same type of judgment 60 years from now either.", "YTA. She\u2019s allowed to have memories with her dad even if they don\u2019t jive with what you think she should have been doing.", ">Some of her roles had her as really in tune with nature and loving animals\n\nYou have this back to front. She was playing a character in each role. People do not necessarily feel the same way as the characters they pretend to be while someone is pointing a camera at them. These movies were looking for a girl of a specific age and aesthetic who could jump through the hoops they demanded in exchange for financial compensation.  It just happened to be that your mother fulfilled the requirements of the role and was willing to say the things they told her to say and do what they told her to do. Could have been any one of a thousand other girls. Those roles do not automatically reflect who she is or what she believes in.\n\nNow fair enough you find your mother did something in her youth that you consider distasteful. I can appreciate that. When we're young we hold up our parents as some mythological figure who can do no wrong, and I imagine that's even more so the case when your parent is in movies, however at some point we have to take the reality check that our parents are fallible humans, as prone to mistakes as bad choices as anyone else. Can you honestly say hand on heart that you've never done anything that any hypothetical future progeny might be embarrassed about?\n\nAccept your mother is human, separate her real flesh-and-blood self from the characters she portrays and appreciate the fact that she doesn't still participate in these activities", "Sigh.  I\u2019ll get downvoted for this, but YTA.  I don\u2019t believe you can judge the 15 year old version of your mother 50 years later and be upset about it.", "Gentle, kind, old-aunt-giving-advice, YTA Your upset about what she said when she was 14 or 15? Really?  Aren't those interviews typically coached, to speak to whatever audience they have, or message they want to send? Come on, if she called you up to lecture you about something you said when you were 14 or 15, would you think that was reasonable?\nI understand your & her opposition to hunting, but I really don't think the old interview is worth this.  Did she even remember that particular conversation specifically? I really doubt it.\nI hope you both can make up later, so you can enjoy your time with each other. I guess I'm biased, because I miss having these no to hing-burger arguments with my mom. Take care, internet friend!", "YTA- wow you need to get a grip.  Surprise parents did things when they were younger that they no longer do now.", "YTA\n\n> Then I mentioned the hunting photos and she was really dismissive about it, not apologetic at all.\n\nI hunt foxes and I'm not apologetic about it. You can yell at me all you want and I still won't be apologetic. The only think you'll accomplish is making me dislike you further.", "YTA. What the hell is wrong with you? Instead of learning about your mother by talking to her about her experiences you are approaching her like a weird stranger who basically expects Miley Cyrus to be Hannah Montana. She\u2019s your mother. She grew up in a different time and had different interests, some of which would have been influenced by her parents\u2019s interests. Why are you treating learning about her as a confrontation instead of just having a chat with her. She doesn\u2019t owe you an explanation or justification for the things she has done, but you could learn about her if you want. You even say in a comment that you wanted to \u201cvent\u201d about it. Like, wtf? You can have questions and she can have answers, but you aren\u2019t a a fucking judge. Calm down and grow up.", "I have a suspicion despite your claim that you have very little idea what kids were doing in the 60s. Fox hunting was very popular at that time. YTA", "YTA", "YTA. Are you kidding me? You're losing your mind over a kis doing an interview and is probably trying to fit in/being proud of her dad like most kids.", "Nta when i was 7 i played rudolf in a school play and now i have a red glowing nose and guide santas slay/s", "YTA, you have no clue what life was like then, some 60 years ago...", "YTA what the fuck\u2026?

My grandmother built stone walls, hunted and was an amazing artist.  Stop judging and accept your mom did a lot of cool things when she was younger. My mom was one of the first female stock car racers.", ">This really caught off me left field and I was genuinely just shocked. She's never told me about this and I could have never expected it.\n\nYour mother is not the same person now that she was when she was fifteen. When she did acting in the 70s and 80s, she wasn't the person she was when she was fifteen.\n\nAll of us are cursed to grow old, and the best of us learn and grow while we age.\n\nYTA for picking a fight over this. There are probably many things that your parents did as children that don't look great when we examine them with 2023 morals. If you need to process your feelings about your mother,  do it with someone who is not your mother. A friend, a sibling- a therapist.", "YTA.  Do you not understand what an actress does?", "LOL imagine having a life where this really bothers you.", "YTA. Your mom has absolutely NOTHING to apologize for. Are you always so ridiculously judgmental??? If the worst thing your mom has ever done is go hunting with her dad, she's an absolute saint.

Grow up", "You know your mom. Is she a hunter? Was she one when you were growing up? It\u2019s really unfair of you to be angry at her about an interview she gave when she was 14 or 15.

Of.course YTA.", "I'm genuinely confused as to what the issue is here", "YTA - Oh no your mom had other hobbies when she was a literal child? Or oh no your mom was a actress who acted like a certain persona? \n\nDo you always have this much time to create problems for no reason? Why should your mother apologize to you for her hobbies that she used to do a child?", "YTA- Ice T has a song called \u201cCop K*ller\u201d which about( you guessed it) k!lling cops.

You literally expect you mom to think the same way she did at 15 years old as an adult? Or even be like any of the roles she was in?", "You're 27? And you can't grasp that acting is the portrayal of something rather that a replication of something? And you wanted you mom to be apologetic about hunting foxes with her dad, because one of her roles had an anti hunting speech?\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Acting is basically pretending to be someone other than who you are. You are judging a 70-year old for something she did as a teen. In 40 years, will you still be the same person you were at age 15?", "YTA, you do know acting is role and not real, right?", "Lord.", "She was like 14. YTA.", "YTA, softly. I understand a dislike for recreational hunting. But you're talking about something she did over 50 years ago, when she was a child and it was completely acceptable at the time. No, most kids didn't hunt but many people did, your grandfather clearly one of them, and your mum was doing an activity with her dad that he probably got her into. I guarantee you that ethical opposition to hunting in the 60s was very much a fringe viewpoint.\n\nYou should also not judge any actor by the roles they play. That's literally what acting is all about - the actor playing the role of someone they aren't. Do you think Alan Rickman was a cruel, selfish prick because he played those roles? Is Malcolm McDowell a psycho who takes pride in sexually abusing people? Actors are people, the roles they play say nothing about their own beliefs.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She was a teen and hardly an adult. Maybe that experience made her decide she didn't like hunting. Look back to when you were 14. You're not the same. You've made mistakes (and learned from them), changed your opinions, and become more worldly. Same as her. People don't stay the same as how they were in their teens.", "YTA. Surely you can think of something you liked at 14 or 15 years old that you no longer like. Also, she was acting, someone else wrote the script that resonated with you.", "Why would this be something for her to apologise about?", "YTA - it is always wrong to hold people from the past accountable for the values of today. Fifty years ago, as much as it bothers many of us now, fox hunting was fairly normal where your mother lived. Clearly, it was a family pursuit as she did it with her father. Also, she was a child. Fox hunting was a social activity as much as much as sport. Your mother owes you absolutely nothing for having a normal, family interest in a sporting activity during a completely different time and place.  \n\nI may be stabbing in the dark here, but it seems that by juxtaposing her acting role as a nature girl with the reality of her as a hunter that you are attempting to imply something about hypocrisy.  If so, give it up. Acting is just that\u2014 acting as if. It\u2019s a job. Your mother said it best, \u201cgrow up\u201d.", "YTA\n\nHave you even met your mother? Do you know anything about her outside of her roles?\n\nNewsflash: actors act. It isn\u2019t really them. \n\nNewsflash: people in news features have their views simplified for mass consumption\n\nThe woman you grew up with is your mother, not anything you can see online or on DVD.", "You\u2019re 27. Find something else in your current time line to be worried/upset about. She is a grown ass woman who had a more exciting life than you. She made her own decisions and lived with them.", "yta. so what she did in real life didn't match what her FICTIONAL character in movies portrayed and you were upset about that? get over yourself and APOLOGIZE!", "YTA and what do you mean \u201cnot typical English girl stuff\u201d - hunting foxes is a pretty wellknown English hobby, do you have an issue that she wasn\u2019t rich enough to be part of an organised Hunt or the fact that she was a girl?", "Surely you understand that when your mother was *acting* she was only voicing some professional writer's thoughts and opinions.\n\nThe fact that you're so scandalized by an article about her (as opposed to one of her characters) indicates that you've never really spent much time getting to know her at all. \n\nInstead of reading profiles of your mom, try asking her some questions. After all, you have a level of access no reporter ever had. Maybe take an interest in her as a person now that you're more peer than child.\n\nYTA", "Did you seriously think some characters she played was who she really is? Wow. You need a psychologist if you cant tell the difference between a movie and real life. YTA\n\n\nDo you think John Banner and Werner Klemperer were a Nazis cause those were the roles they were offered?\n\n(Anyone who doesnt know who those men are, i highly recommend looking them up. And watching Hogans Heros)", "YTA. You know what actresses do, right? And who gave you the right to judge her hobbies as a teen that she enjoyed with her Dad? So what if it's completely different to the roles she played? ROLES, OP. ROLES. She was paid to act them.", "YTA. \n\n\nHer acting roles are play pretend, it's not necessarily who she is/was as a person. You're also mad at her about something from when she was 14 and presumably she liked it because it was bonding with her father. You're holding your mother to a standard you made for her based on characters she pretended to be.", "YTA it\u2019s 2023 and you\u2019re mad about something that happened before you was even born get over it", "Omg. YTA. So obviously. I can't believe you can't see thst.\n\nYou realize movies aren't real right? There are no mermaids, no wizards, hogwarts isn't real either and the romance/entire interaction of jack and rose was made up for the movie.\n\nJust because your moms character was against hunting, doesn't mean she is too. It's called acting for good reason. Or do you think Daniel Craig is actually a British spy too?\n\nYou should learn the difference between reality and fiction and apologize to your mom. She did nothing wrong.", "YTA OP, Just because *you* have no clue about managing the countryside and fox hunting does not mean that you get to impose all your views on everyone else. Will...unless, of course, your ok with me forcing vegans to eat a steak...", "honey idk how to tell you that actors aren\u2019t their roles. YTA", "YTA, she was acting. How can you expect her to be like the character she portrayed and get mad that she wasn't. She was a teenager who went hunting with her dad, who cares? Your mother was also a teenager when she said this. She doesn't owe you an apology. If anything, you owe her one by judging her about something she said in the past.", "YTA, you want her to \u201capologize \u201c for something that was printed about her 50-60 years ago?!?!?  Are you kidding?  And you\u2019re upset that it doesn\u2019t jive with the opinion that you formed of her by watching her act in films?!?!?  You do know that when you \u201cact\u201d it\u2019s not real, right?", "YTA. So, you are upset over a photo taken for a magazine article over 50 years ago?  You are being ridiculous. How would you feel if your mom took something you said or did when you were 14 and berated you for it now?", "I really hope there isn\u2019t a person out there waiting to judge me on something I did when I was 14. YTA", "Why does she owe you an apology for something she did as a teen over 50 years ago? You are putting of huge main character vibes. YTA", "You're 27 and sound like pre-teen. Why are you judging her for stuff she did at 14 just because it \"contradicts\" acting roles she had? \nYTA.", "YTA News flash OP Lenard Nemoy was not an alien.", "Yta. You blame your mother for something she said and did as a child because her acting job acting as an adult was a non hunter? Do you see how weird that is? Acting isn't real. You are trying to keep your mom in a fantasy world. Also people change and there is nothing wrong with that. As an adult your mother probably thought you understood that but you proved her wrong.", "YTA\nYou surely must not have believed that your mother actually was the characters she played.. didn't you? Why would you be mad at her for saying something at age 15?", "YTA!!!! Your mother was young and that happened long ago! Don\u2019t get caught up on what you saw in a film!! Remember she was acting! Your mom is right and you need to grow up!! Also you should apologize", "YTA. I really hope I'm not judged by something I did when I was 15 years old. Goodness.", "YTA. Apology for what? Lol.", "YTA and I really think you need therapy. This is such a bizarre reaction to your mom acting and having hobbies as a teenager.", "You think your mother should, what, apologise to you on bended knee because of something she did as a teenager, long before she ever met you? A literal child? Grow up. YTA", "\u201cYes, how dare she not be contrite for not adhere to social norms from 50 years in the future!   \n And then to imagine that she is not completely under the supervision of her children.  The effrontery.\u201d\n\nYTA.", "This reminds me of that Fox News article where they said Jamie Lee Curtis was a hypocrite because she used guns in Halloween well being anti-gun in real life. Learn to separate fiction from reality cause it's concerning the amount of people that can't. YTA", "YTA. Feels like you just want something to be pissy about. Or to post about. This happened decades ago. She's not cleaning her rifle while you talk to her, is she? Let it go, Elsa.", "YTA.\n\nYou do realise there's a difference between a character and an actor? Do you think Javier Bardem is really a psychopathic hitman? Or Bryan Cranston condones drugs?  \n\nAlso, you didn't like *her* in that movie, you liked her *character* and her *acting,* both of which deserve to be appreciated if it was so convincing. \n\nThe 60s were also a different time with different cultures. What was acceptable then was also different to what was acceptable in the 1920s.  \n\nFollow your mum's advice, grow up.", "You\u2019re judging her on something she said almost 60 years ago as a 14 year old????   Seriously??  Give your head a shake, do it you have any clue what was acceptable and the norm back then that people these days would be horrified at.   Did you know women couldn\u2019t have their own bank accounts?   Didn\u2019t have credit cards in their own name, were identified as Mrs John Smith.   Things have changed\u2026 and they will continue to do so, just wait until you get judged for something you did or said when you were a kid by your kid who thinks they know it all and can look down their noses at you\u2026", "It's classic sexism that lead to all your mums roles being the same polite, sweet, animal loving girl. Women historically never get written as complex dynamic or believable characters. They get written as subservient, sweet and caring or otherwise ruthless, evil and irrational. YTA for buying whole heartedly into the sexist dogma of the 1960s and failing to get to know your own mother as a real person. You honestly sound like you have some difficulty distinguishing fantasy from reality.", "YTA. You understand what an actor is, right? You are holding your mother to a standard of a fake person.\n\nRegardless, It was a long time ago and people grow.", "Let me get this straight, you - a 27 year old - got in a fight with a 70+ year old - for doing something when she was 14 - that didn\u2019t match the image of the pretend people she played when she was in her 20s and 30s?\n\n\n\nIs this an audition for an all female revival of Monty Python? Or are you just an AH?", "YTA. She was 14, like 60 years ago when the mindset was totally different from now.\nWhat should she do? Lifelong self flagellation?", "YTA. Your mom and the roles she was PAID to play are two different things. Working women in the 60's were much rarer than today. She's lucky she was able to obtain wholesome roles, many weren't. Further, no one is solely their job. I don't know how old you are, but being mad at your mom for being different than you imagined is weird, especially at what her current age must be. Do you think Clint Eastwood is all of the things he has been in his movies, commencing in the 60's? Be proud of your mom.", "Yta", "YTA why are you digging this up? No one cares except now you\u2026.. are you an angry vegan?", "It's especially weird because this is OP's MOM, but OP talks about her like they mostly only know her from her acting roles. It's like how an immature member of a fandom would talk about an actor, having growing pains when they realize a person is different from the roles they've played. OP doesn't talk about their mother as though she's someone they know in real life. It's just weird.", "Plus it's like...she was a literal teenager, people change as they grow up, it's not hypocritical to change your stance on something, or gain more nuance to your stance on something, as you get older.\n\nedit:small addition", "I'm like super confused. I don't have any relatives or friends who act but even I know the roles depicted on a show or a movie is not real. How is this news to OP?", "Thank you!", "I feel like this would be like being angry at vegan for eating meat before they became vegan", "And even if she hadn't changed, like it or not (in the US, so only applicable in my region), the capital gained from hunting licenses to hunt water fowl funds conservation for marshes and wetlands.\n\nI don't hunt, but I work in WL conservation and am more than familiar with WL policy/law and conservation budgets per state. I wish people would just WANT to save our biodiversity and habitats, but the people shooting animals fund it all to keep their \"sport\" viable. Again, wish it weren't so, but at this point it's what we have. \n\nOP, YTA. You picked a fight over something that happened DECADES ago. A whole lifetime ago. And you expect an apology or guilt over it? Nahhhhh.", "And you seriously can\u2019t differentiate your own mother from the roles she\u2019s played? Do you even know her at all?", "Thank you for bringing up the fact that she was doing this with her father! It sounds like she did not continue with this hobby all through her life, but at the time she was young and probably just enjoyed bonding with her dad!\n\nMany people take up hobbies their parents like, specifically because it means spending time and interacting with the people they look up to the most as children. \n\nOp YTA for expecting her to have your same views as a child 60 years ago. Most people grow and change over time. It\u2019s also a little weird you see her as her acting roles and aren\u2019t allowing for her to have had her own life outside of those small roles.", "I honestly reread the post thinking that maybe the OP was a teen and just lacked the maturity to recognise the above. No, OP is 27.", "Hunting foxes is good for the environment where I live", "Exactly, as a young teen you don't get to decide what your parents take you to do with them and it's okay for her to have mixed feelings.  Fond memories of her dad giving her time and attention mixed with, perhaps some guilt or unease about the activity itself. \n\nIt almost sounds like there's an odd... fan/son relationship going on here. You're disenchanted by finding out a celebrity isn't without some duality and because they're your mom you can actually confront them.\n\nI think maybe it would behoove you to dig into that a little bit, maybe with a therapist because your mom should be able to just be a person with her own kid.", "Maybe it\u2019s not he\u2019s mom, OP might just be a friend, he uses mom here, just because he feels that would give him some form of entitlement.

Being a son or daughter OP should have see old family photos.", "So, this is where you read that statement again and you see that your problem is YOU. Your mom wasn't and isn't that anti hunting woman. She was only acting. You attached the personality traits you like of the fictitious character onto your mother.

Her own daughter couldn't even tell she isn't actually the person she played on film.", "Have you ever heard of acting?! Jeez, you really are a entitled AH!", "Why? Assuming she was sincere about being anti-hunting, maybe that lovely bonding activity with her dad when she was a child helped shape her views. \n\nMaybe you should try getting to know your mother as a person.

There are actors who play nazis and actually had fascism. There are actors who play virgins who have had numerous sexual partners. There are actors who play gay characters who are straight.

Your mom was doing the same.\n\nYou didn\u2019t approach this as something new you learned about your mom and wanted to understand, you approached it as if she had to justify herself to you.
