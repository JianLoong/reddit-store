Most of her roles (bar one where she's the main villain of a movie) were mainly as a pleasant,polite, wholesome woman/girl. Some of her roles had her as really in tune with nature and loving animals. In one of her movies, she's anti hunting and has a little speech to another character how she doesn't want her son raised in a world where violence is normalized (like with hunting). I really liked her in that movie and I also like sorta digging into her past and finding out new stuff about her like articles and interviews, she wasn't really famous as an actress but she did have some significant roles and I like learning more in my spare time.\n\nI found an old article from the late 1960s when she was 14 or 15 about how she was starting modeling and talking about her aspirations to be an actress. In the article the bit that has stuck with me was this part where it said she loves hunting foxes with her Dad. It was accompanied by 2 photos of her. One of her in a forest with a hunting rifle presumably tracking a fox and the other was a photo of her with a full smile with the rifle in her hands. This really caught off me left field and I was genuinely just shocked. She's never told me about this and I could have never expected it.\n\nI decided to phone her about it. I mentioned finding the article which she was very positive in response too. Then I mentioned the hunting photos and she was really dismissive about it, not apologetic at all. I asked her does she not feel guilty about it or embarrassed and she just shrugged it off saying it was a long time ago and she's obviously not a poacher. I replied how shocked I was over this especially with how most of her roles depict her and I was a little cross about it. She got defensive and made this remark trying to say I'm being sexist because I'm shocked she wasn't doing typical English girl stuff in the 1960s and I should grow up. I responded saying \"I doubt many kids in the 1960s were hunting foxes\". She signed and gave a quick goodbye and hung up.\n\nAm I in the wrong for being upset about this?\n\nDid not expect this level of a reaction or attention.

Because you looked at her acting roles and presumed that must be how she is irl. It\u2019s called acting for a reason. Why are you getting mad at her for having hobbies that differ from her roles?", "YTA. What are you even upset about?\n\nOh no! Your mom existed as a person with a full life and hobbies before you came along?\n\nShe changed her mind on something from when she was a freakin teenager. Get over it.", "YTA and I hate to be the one to break this to you, but your mom was an actress.  Actors read from a script.  The words they say and the actions they make on screen are not their personalities.  If your mom hunted in her past and never mentioned it, it's likely because she moved on from that part of her past and it simply is not important to her.  I actually feel bad for your poor mother who raised a child incapable of distinguishing between reality and make-believe.", "YTA. You\u2019re really gonna pick a fight w/ your mom about this, something that happened 50+ years ago when societal norms were completely different (AND while she was a young teen, at that)? Ugh\u2026get over yourself. \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\udc4e", "YTA\n\nAnimal lover here, but OMG, your mom was a teen! Let it go. English girls -- fox hunting was a norm. She did what her father did.\n\nGet over it.", "Yta. Here's a piece of news that wasn't in the article...your mother is a human being who lived a whole life before you were even born. You are judging the CHILD (only 14)  your mother was at a completely different era of time both in her growth and in societies. Above all though She doesn't owe you an explanation or an apology for your sanctimonious and judgemental opinion of her past life not meeting your idea of some makebelieve image that you think she should have. Get over yourself.", "YTA.  She was a child (and thus easily influenced by her parents beliefs and activities) and it was a long time ago.  You also seem astounded that an actor could actually, you know, act in a role and portray people that aren't exactly like them.", "YTA for judging your mother for statements she made in her early teens (about something she was raised to view as normal) and childhood experiences she had.", "YTA, she was 15! You're upset that your mum didn't share values of the characters she played! You're being ridiculous.", "Hahaha, yes YTA. Are you kidding me. Being angry about something that happened over 60 years ago, when she was barely old enough to think for herself. Absolute joke.", "YTA. She was a child at the time. She was probably following her parents beliefs. She\u2019s an adult now and she\u2019s grown. When you know better, you do better.", "Yeah.. YTA. Why are you mad at your mother who did something that 60 years carried different connotations to the same act 60 years later? Do think that in 60 years it will be fair for your kids to judge you on something that you did today that is socially unacceptable in the future?", "Yta. She was 14-15, like let it go. I actually had to go back and double-check your age because you sound like you have some growing up to do still. Do some deeper thinking rather than having your initial feelings control you.", "YTA. Your mom did some shit as a teenager with her family over 60 years ago . . . that she grew out of in the years since. Come back here in 60 years and tell us how you're exactly the same person as you are now.", "YTA, why does it matter so much what she did at 14? And why do you think she should be ashamed/feel guilty, and are disappointed she isn't? \n\nAnd just for the record - you know that roles are just that... roles, and have absolutely nothing to do with the person's REAL feelings/persona, do you? The sweetest actress can play a vilain, and a mean girl can play a saint, and it means ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.", "YTA. Omg that was over 50 years ago, leave the woman alone, she was a teen bonding with your grandpa.", "YTA, she was a kid and that was 60 years ago. Grow up.", "YTA\n\ngrow up", "YTA ffs she had a life before she was mom", "YTA. \n\nHunting was and still is a dear hobby for many.", "YTA a different lifetime, long removed. Dredging up a past that didn't even include you is silly and out of place. \n\nIf you WANT to hold the past against her, at least make it relevant to YOU. This isn't. You weren't born, qnd this has nothing to do with you. If anything, you owe her an apology for making an issue of something unrelated to you at all.", "YTA. Lmao This has nothing to do with you you\u2019re starting a fight with your mom about some thing from 50+ years ago in what world do you actually think the right thing to do is call your mom and give her shit about some thing from when she was a kid?", "YTA big time.  Hunting isn't your thing which is your prerogative but it was an activity that your mom had with her father.  You are transferring yours and maybe today's beliefs to something in the past, in this case the 1960's.  Different timeframes, different thought process, and different activities that your judging.  Your mom has every right to look back at it fondly.  Stop being the all high and mighty with your perspective, it's going to be different than your moms.  It's okay to have your views but your pushing them on your mother from an activity 60 years ago.   What's important is not to cast shock/dispersion over history but to learn from it and make your own decisions.  Also, your mom is correct, grow the hell up and I bet you wouldn't like any of your offspring to cast the same type of judgment 60 years from now either.", "YTA. She\u2019s allowed to have memories with her dad even if they don\u2019t jive with what you think she should have been doing.", ">Some of her roles had her as really in tune with nature and loving animals\n\nYou have this back to front. She was playing a character in each role. People do not necessarily feel the same way as the characters they pretend to be while someone is pointing a camera at them. These movies were looking for a girl of a specific age and aesthetic who could jump through the hoops they demanded in exchange for financial compensation.  It just happened to be that your mother fulfilled the requirements of the role and was willing to say the things they told her to say and do what they told her to do. Could have been any one of a thousand other girls. Those roles do not automatically reflect who she is or what she believes in.\n\nNow fair enough you find your mother did something in her youth that you consider distasteful. I can appreciate that. When we're young we hold up our parents as some mythological figure who can do no wrong, and I imagine that's even more so the case when your parent is in movies, however at some point we have to take the reality check that our parents are fallible humans, as prone to mistakes as bad choices as anyone else. Can you honestly say hand on heart that you've never done anything that any hypothetical future progeny might be embarrassed about?\n\nAccept your mother is human, separate her real flesh-and-blood self from the characters she portrays and appreciate the fact that she doesn't still participate in these activities", "Sigh.  I\u2019ll get downvoted for this, but YTA.  I don\u2019t believe you can judge the 15 year old version of your mother 50 years later and be upset about it.", "Gentle, kind, old-aunt-giving-advice, YTA Your upset about what she said when she was 14 or 15? Really?  Aren't those interviews typically coached, to speak to whatever audience they have, or message they want to send? Come on, if she called you up to lecture you about something you said when you were 14 or 15, would you think that was reasonable?\nI understand your & her opposition to hunting, but I really don't think the old interview is worth this.  Did she even remember that particular conversation specifically? I really doubt it.\nI hope you both can make up later, so you can enjoy your time with each other. I guess I'm biased, because I miss having these no to hing-burger arguments with my mom. Take care, internet friend!", "YTA- wow you need to get a grip.  Surprise parents did things when they were younger that they no longer do now.", "YTA\n\n> Then I mentioned the hunting photos and she was really dismissive about it, not apologetic at all.\n\nI hunt foxes and I'm not apologetic about it. You can yell at me all you want and I still won't be apologetic. The only think you'll accomplish is making me dislike you further.", "YTA. What the hell is wrong with you? Instead of learning about your mother by talking to her about her experiences you are approaching her like a weird stranger who basically expects Miley Cyrus to be Hannah Montana. She\u2019s your mother. She grew up in a different time and had different interests, some of which would have been influenced by her parents\u2019s interests. Why are you treating learning about her as a confrontation instead of just having a chat with her. She doesn\u2019t owe you an explanation or justification for the things she has done, but you could learn about her if you want. You even say in a comment that you wanted to \u201cvent\u201d about it. Like, wtf? You can have questions and she can have answers, but you aren\u2019t a a fucking judge. Calm down and grow up.", "I have a suspicion despite your claim that you have very little idea what kids were doing in the 60s. Fox hunting was very popular at that time. YTA", "YTA", "YTA. Are you kidding me? You're losing your mind over a kis doing an interview and is probably trying to fit in/being proud of her dad like most kids.", "Nta when i was 7 i played rudolf in a school play and now i have a red glowing nose and guide santas slay/s", "YTA, you have no clue what life was like then, some 60 years ago...", "YTA what the fuck\u2026? You\u2019re mad because she played a fictional role once and it didn\u2019t entirely represent who she actually is?\n\nYou cannot be this dense, mate.", "YTA. My grandmother built stone walls, hunted and was an amazing artist.  Stop judging and accept your mom did a lot of cool things when she was younger. My mom was one of the first female stock car racers.", ">This really caught off me left field and I was genuinely just shocked. She's never told me about this and I could have never expected it.\n\nYour mother is not the same person now that she was when she was fifteen. When she did acting in the 70s and 80s, she wasn't the person she was when she was fifteen.\n\nAll of us are cursed to grow old, and the best of us learn and grow while we age.\n\nYTA for picking a fight over this. There are probably many things that your parents did as children that don't look great when we examine them with 2023 morals. If you need to process your feelings about your mother,  do it with someone who is not your mother. A friend, a sibling- a therapist.", "YTA.  Do you not understand what an actress does?", "LOL imagine having a life where this really bothers you.", "YTA. Your mom has absolutely NOTHING to apologize for. Are you always so ridiculously judgmental??? If the worst thing your mom has ever done is go hunting with her dad, she's an absolute saint. You, on the other hand, sound like an extremely critical, judgmental person who's just looking for something to be angry about.", "I\u2019d love to see the stoopid s*** you did when you were 14-15.

Honestly.", "YTA.  By age 27, most people are aware that movies involve acting--not people being their off stage self.", "YTA. Would you be as upset as you are now if you met Leonardo DiCaprio and realized he wasn\u2019t a horribly racist southern magnate slave owner who likes to watch black people fight to death because he thinks they\u2019re lesser?", "YTA. Why you mad at something a kid did 50 years ago? Also, I think hunting is gross, but it\u2019s way common in all cultures.

I\u2019m 25 and my mom absolutely destroyed my mental health when I was a teenager but I forgave her because she did the best she could with the resources at the time and now we have a closer relationship because I don\u2019t fight with her over things that ultimately mean nothing because I know one day I won\u2019t get to speak with her anymore. Grow up", "You know your mom. Is she a hunter? Was she one when you were growing up? It\u2019s really unfair of you to be angry at her about an interview she gave when she was 14 or 15. If you were proud of her before you read it, you should still be proud of her. She hasn\u2019t changed. You just have one more piece of information. It\u2019s just an article.

Don\u2019t let this change anything.", "YTA \n\nIt was decades before you were even born \n\nGet over yourself", "You're mad because your mom doesn't necessarily agree with some fictional characters she portrayed in a movie? \n\nReally? Of.course YTA.", "I'm genuinely confused as to what the issue is here", "YTA - Oh no your mom had other hobbies when she was a literal child? Or oh no your mom was a actress who acted like a certain persona? \n\nDo you always have this much time to create problems for no reason? Why should your mother apologize to you for her hobbies that she used to do a child?", "YTA- Ice T has a song called \u201cCop K*ller\u201d which about( you guessed it) k!lling cops. Since 2000, so 23 years, he played Detective Odafin \u201cFin\u201d Tutuola, a cop on Law and Order: Special Victims Unit. You literally expect you mom to think the same way she did at 15 years old as an adult? Or even be like any of the roles she was in?", "You're 27? And you can't grasp that acting is the portrayal of something rather that a replication of something? And you wanted you mom to be apologetic about hunting foxes with her dad, because one of her roles had an anti hunting speech?\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Acting is basically pretending to be someone other than who you are. You are judging a 70-year old for something she did as a teen. In 40 years, will you still be the same person you were at age 15?", "YTA, you do know acting is role and not real, right?", "Lord.", "She was like 14. YTA.", "YTA, softly. I understand a dislike for recreational hunting. But you're talking about something she did over 50 years ago, when she was a child and it was completely acceptable at the time. No, most kids didn't hunt but many people did, your grandfather clearly one of them, and your mum was doing an activity with her dad that he probably got her into. I guarantee you that ethical opposition to hunting in the 60s was very much a fringe viewpoint.\n\nYou should also not judge any actor by the roles they play. That's literally what acting is all about - the actor playing the role of someone they aren't. Do you think Alan Rickman was a cruel, selfish prick because he played those roles? Is Malcolm McDowell a psycho who takes pride in sexually abusing people? Actors are people, the roles they play say nothing about their own beliefs.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I want to be clear I don't agree with fox hunting , but you have to consider what was okay during her childhood compared to yours.\n\n A lot of our moral compass is imprinted at a young age, so she probably still views it as a thing that is fine to do, even though laws and society have changed. \n\nThere's stuff that was normal to me as a kid that I would cringe at if I saw kids doing now, and I'm around the same age you are. \n\nYou can educate and explain why it's wrong, and maybe she can come to change her opinion, but she can't change the fact she liked her hobby as a teenager and at least she isn't hunting now (I hope). \n\nI just think you're holding her to an unfair standard.

She was a teen and hardly an adult. Maybe that experience made her decide she didn't like hunting. Look back to when you were 14. You're not the same. You've made mistakes (and learned from them), changed your opinions, and become more worldly. Same as her. People don't stay the same as how they were in their teens.", "YTA.

Fifty years ago, as much as it bothers many of us now, fox hunting was fairly normal where your mother lived. Clearly, it was a family pursuit as she did it with her father. Also, she was a child. Fox hunting was a social activity as much as much as sport. Your mother owes you absolutely nothing for having a normal, family interest in a sporting activity during a completely different time and place.  \n\nI may be stabbing in the dark here, but it seems that by juxtaposing her acting role as a nature girl with the reality of her as a hunter that you are attempting to imply something about hypocrisy.  If so, give it up. Acting is just that\u2014 acting as if. It\u2019s a job. Your mother said it best, \u201cgrow up\u201d.", "YTA\n\nHave you even met your mother?

There are no mermaids, no wizards, hogwarts isn't real either and the romance/entire interaction of jack and rose was made up for the movie.\n\nJust because your moms character was against hunting, doesn't mean she is too.

Yea - she was not the only fox hunter in her school. She might have even wore fur coats back then- people had not turned against it yet.\n\nNot just one social class - at least two. I have farmer relatives, and grew up being told that hunting was a necessary evil because they'd had to deal with the carnage after a fox got into their chicken run and wanted to prevent it happening again. It took me years as an adult to look beyond the immediate pragmatism and think \"yes, but there are other ways to deal with that\".\n\n(For those who aren't rural, when foxes are faced with a whole lot of chickens in an enclosed space, they don't just kill the one they need for a meal now. This is partly a self-protective measure because chickens can be vicious when threatened and will fight for their lives - to the point where it isn't unknown for a flock to stampede and kill an intruding fox - and also partly because foxes' natural behaviour is to stockpile in the event of a glut of food, to make up for the times when a hunt doesn't pan out. The problem is that when you've got an artificially enclosed space, that means that unless stopped, the fox will just keep on killing chickens until none are left, and even a small chicken run will have 20+ birds. It is a truly awful sight.)", "Just to add, that fox hunting was seen as necessary to protect the newborn lambs on the farm from being torn apart by foxes.  Foxes really aren't that cute.", "Agreed. Fox hunting with dogs wasn't banned in the UK until around the millennium (2002 in Scotland, 2004 for the rest of the UK). A significant number of rural folk still wish it were legal (though support is dropping as time proves that you can manage foxes in other ways). And although the official rule says that traditional fox hunting organisations can continue to operate with trail hunts (sacks of smelly things dragged round the countryside for the dogs to follow instead of targeting an animal), there are a whole bunch of them that have been found to have broken the rules and deliberately killed foxes. \n\nThat said, the tide does seem to be turning though, in that many of the big landowners seem to be a lot less in support than they used to be, and have started to ban rule-breaking Hunts from using their land.\n\nIt's utterly weird that OP would be shocked that a teenager might support something which was at the time taken for granted, and wouldn't really start to be controversial for another twenty years at least.
