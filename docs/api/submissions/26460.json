I work for a company that works in the US and the UK. Due to the nature of my specific role in the company, I must travel between the US and the UK for the company; this means I often spend half of the year in the US and half the year in the UK. I get six weeks of annual leave a year, so I took three weeks in the US to catch up with friends and three weeks in the UK to spend in the UK and catch up with my friends and family where we are initially from. \n\nBecause of my time in the US, I decided to buy a three-bedroom apartment in the heart of NYC, where the company is also found in the US; the British company is based in central London. My BIL is an only child, but he has mentioned he's got family, such as cousins, aunts and uncles in the US, and he would love to go and visit them one day. Before my sister had their child, my sister mentioned that she would love to go to NYC to see her husband's side of the family with him. Now that they've had their child, they feel that it's time to go and visit their family. It's worth mentioning, but my BIL family are entirely British and immigrated to the US. \n\nMy BIL earns a decent salary in the UK but primarily goes on the mortgage, their kid, and their household. My sister works part-time, but most of her income goes to her bills and their son. They have enough money to make it last for the month as a just-in-case they need to buy stuff. My BIL and sister are only open to family members about their finances whereas I'm more private and they don't know how much I earn and I like to keep it that way.\n\nA few days ago my sister video-called me to catch up and she was talking about how she and her husband feels now is the perfect time to go to America. She told me they've saved the money for the plane tickets there and back, they've got spending money but that can't afford accommodation yet. My sister knows I have an apartment in NYC because of my job and she asked if they could stay in my apartment. I know it's not an answer but I have that gut feeling that something about this trip isn't right so I made the choice to say no. \n\nMy sister understands that I said no and she accepts it but she's a little upset. I spoke to my best friend about this and she was honest in saying she thinks I'm being an asshole because I won't let them stay in my apartment which I'm not currently occupying. She told me to come here and get some judgement from an outside perspective to see if I'm an asshole.\n\nI do feel like I'm being an asshole because I have said no to my sister.

We don't owe anyone our home, our car, our bike etc. We can say no even if you're living there and they are visiting while you're in NYC. Everyone can do whatever they want with their own home and we don't even need to give a reason. \n\nAlso, as adults and parents, budgeting is a part of life. If they can only afford the airfare, they wouldn't be able to visit if you didn't live in NYC. So if they can't afford it and expect you to give them free accommodation, what right do they have to be upset at you when they're the ones asking for a huuuuuge favor? Why can't they ask the multitude of relatives that BIL has in NYC?", "NTA\n\nIts your home and as such you are completely ok in saying 'no' for no other reason than you \"dont want to\"\n\nYou have NO requirement nor responsibility to open your home to family or friends to stay at (particularly if you wont be there) NO MATTER WHAT.\n\nI have always gone with my gut. The intuition is what nature has given us to alert us to danger or something not right.\n\nUnless you absolutely just dont want to (which is fine) maybe question your sister a bit more about why they are travelling, what they are thinking of doing, how long are they staying etc. It might bring out something that you can then pinpoint as to why your gut is telling you 'dont do it'.", "INFO What is your concern?

And your sister has accepted it with grace so there\u2019s no need to be accusing anyone of entitlement.\n\nBut. Why don\u2019t you want to? You seem to care for and respect your sister and her little fam. You aren\u2019t giving any sort of examples of crap she pulls that makes you not want her in your flat.\n\nSo while you don\u2019t have to let them stay there, theres no rules that say we cant be happy to let our sister who we love, use our empty flat for a couple weeks and help out family, knowing they wont abuse your place and its not putting you out in any way. \n\nSo whats the gut about the trip not being right?", "INFO: Since most of what you wrote regarding your family is about money, is that the issue here? What is it about your money or their money that has you so hung up you spent most of your post talking about money, rather than people?", "I mean, you do you, it's NTA, but personally I can't imagine not doing my sister a solid in this way.

Or are you not really close?", "NAH. It's your property,  you have final say in who stays in it. But she's not an AH for trying to save money when traveling to see family.

Yes, you are under no obligation to allow anyone who doesn\u2019t pay rent to stay in your apartment.

So your choice is the very definition of asshole behavior.", "NTA - Most people regret not listening to a gut feeling. Besides, your house, your decision.

You don\u2019t want anyone in your space and that don\u2019t make you an AH either. No one is owed access to your property because you aren\u2019t using it at the time.\n\nI\u2019d worry that allowing your sister in would open the floodgates for requests from BIL\u2019s family.

Not that they are owed free accommodation but it could be a nice gesture.", "YTA\nThe tone of your post is strange to say the least. You've given no legitimate reason for saying no.

I think you are being incredibly mean. Of course you don't have to say yes, but why on earth would you not? I'm lucky to have an amazing sister and I wouldn't dream of ever saying no to anything she asked for as she has been so generous with me. \nI have no words. Can't understand how you can justify saying no. Really bad fucking karma. Really bad.", "INFO:  Do you have any reason to believe your sister\u2019s family would not treat your apartment with respect?\n\nIf the answer is no, I think you should let them stay as this is your sister ( I would not have the same answer for a cousin).

Now, we have a rule. Only our parents can stay alone. It makes it clear and avoided conflicts.", "NTA\n\nNYC isn't going anywhere, so they can save a bit more to afford accommodations.  \n\nAlso BIL has family they can stay with in the US, ask to use their homes or ask for money to help subsidize the cost of the visit.", "Yta  you sound really condescending on this post , no real reasons why she can\u2019t stay , more obsessed with income etc very bizzare really hope your sister and her little family make it there without your help , and In the future you need nothing off them", "NTA. While it understandably made your sister feel a little hurt, you are in no way the asshole for not letting them stay. Sometimes you need to listen to your gut and make sure you protect yourself from anything bad that may happen. If he has family there, they can ask to stay with them. Its a hard decision to make, but they could have easily arranged it to see if they could stay with you when you were there rather than when you aren\u2019t there, which would help give you more control over their use of the space", "I mean technically and legally you are N T A but I'd personally and definitely let my sister stay at my place in the same situation.

I wouldn't want someone, even if they are family staying at my place.. sleeping in my bed for two weeks without me there", "NAH. It's your place to say yes or no. It's not unreasonable for your sister to ask, though. Personally that's something I would do for family unless they've given me reason not to, but everyone has their own boundaries.", "NTA\n\nA gut feeling is plenty of reason to say no. Any time I've gone against my gut, I've regretted it hugely. It really does sound like they intend to ask his family to stay at the apartment with them.

She would simply call the authorities and have them removed.", "I agree with that on so many posts", "Right.

If they see what kind of apartment OP has and where it's located, they are going to start questioning how much money he is making. Then the issue of does BILs family live near the city? If so, I can fully imagine that they would love to take the train in and stay in an apartment. I have done that with friends. Which means more people coming to the apartment. Also, OP isn't currently staying in the apartment, so they won't be able to easily check up on it after their stay until their next trip out there.", "Yes I found the \"gut feeling\". Bit odd, like does OP have some strange suspicion about sister or BIL or just uncomfortable. I personally would be slightly stressed that I would need to clean, but wouldn't hesitate to say yes", "So you think unequivocally, without any nuance or grey area, everyone is an asshole unless they let family stay at their place? That's bonkers to me. People aren't all the same.

Because where OPs apartment is more convenient which will inevitably have even *more* people staying there.", "Why are you overreacting? In this specific incident, in which the OP asked for judgment on her choice, I say she is the asshole because she can give no valid reason to allow what her sister asked for.

Move on with your ridiculous exaggerations.", "No, she really doesn't. \"Gut feelings\" are inherently devoid of any general basis, they're just... there. Inexplicable at their very core so why does she need to explain that or any other feeling?", "This is a judgement sub. We read the OP and vote on it. Not all of us agree. I also understand the differences and nuances, but my *opinion* is that OP's not an AH for being uncomfortable in this situation. \n\nIt's just amusing to me that you're the one getting all riled up and then you say I'm overreacting, exaggerating and being ridiculous. LOL. Have a nice weekend.", "I\u2019d feel a little weird having my sister and her family stay in my place when I was not there. Plus NYC is not a place where you stay with people. Even apartments with multiple bedrooms are tiny. \n\nIt\u2019s not like this was an emergency and OP is leaving them high and dry. They can take more time to save up.", "Just because you don\u2019t need a reason to say no does not mean you are not TA. Family. Sisters. She gave absolutely no reason as to why she couldn\u2019t let her sisters family stay at her place that is empty for a week or whatever while they visit BIL family. In my books, that means YTA. If there was a reason to fuck over her sister and her family other than \u201cgut feeling\u201d id be on board but there is nothing. She is just being an asshole to her sister", "Why would you not want to do something nice for your sister and her family when in reality it won\u2019t have any affect on you? Other than doing a load of sheets when you get back", "Oh honey you have lived a sheltered life if you think that the only impact is a load of sheets. There\u2019s the invasion of privacy, the risk of damage to your place, all kinds of things. You think because everyone is family there is no risk. We had to spend quite a bit of money because a 4 year old clogged the toilet with a toy and it overflowed, causing the floorboards underneath to get wet under the tile and to damage the ceiling below. It was not cheap to replace the drywall and everything. I will never host people when I\u2019m not there again.", "Would your family not cover damages they caused? Because mine would. Sheltered life my ass I just trust my two sisters enough to stay in my apartment and not make me destitute or cost me 1mil in damages and one of them has two kids under 5 who miraculously have not thrown a toy in a toilet."]}
