I work for a company that works in the US and the UK. Due to the nature of my specific role in the company, I must travel between the US and the UK for the company; this means I often spend half of the year in the US and half the year in the UK. I get six weeks of annual leave a year, so I took three weeks in the US to catch up with friends and three weeks in the UK to spend in the UK and catch up with my friends and family where we are initially from. \n\nBecause of my time in the US, I decided to buy a three-bedroom apartment in the heart of NYC, where the company is also found in the US; the British company is based in central London. My BIL is an only child, but he has mentioned he's got family, such as cousins, aunts and uncles in the US, and he would love to go and visit them one day. Before my sister had their child, my sister mentioned that she would love to go to NYC to see her husband's side of the family with him. Now that they've had their child, they feel that it's time to go and visit their family. It's worth mentioning, but my BIL family are entirely British and immigrated to the US. \n\nMy BIL earns a decent salary in the UK but primarily goes on the mortgage, their kid, and their household. My sister works part-time, but most of her income goes to her bills and their son. They have enough money to make it last for the month as a just-in-case they need to buy stuff. My BIL and sister are only open to family members about their finances whereas I'm more private and they don't know how much I earn and I like to keep it that way.\n\nA few days ago my sister video-called me to catch up and she was talking about how she and her husband feels now is the perfect time to go to America. She told me they've saved the money for the plane tickets there and back, they've got spending money but that can't afford accommodation yet. My sister knows I have an apartment in NYC because of my job and she asked if they could stay in my apartment. I know it's not an answer but I have that gut feeling that something about this trip isn't right so I made the choice to say no. \n\nMy sister understands that I said no and she accepts it but she's a little upset. I spoke to my best friend about this and she was honest in saying she thinks I'm being an asshole because I won't let them stay in my apartment which I'm not currently occupying. She told me to come here and get some judgement from an outside perspective to see if I'm an asshole.\n\nI do feel like I'm being an asshole because I have said no to my sister.

We don't owe anyone our home, our car, our bike etc. We can say no even if you're living there and they are visiting while you're in NYC. Everyone can do whatever they want with their own home and we don't even need to give a reason. \n\nAlso, as adults and parents, budgeting is a part of life. If they can only afford the airfare, they wouldn't be able to visit if you didn't live in NYC. So if they can't afford it and expect you to give them free accommodation, what right do they have to be upset at you when they're the ones asking for a huuuuuge favor? Why can't they ask the multitude of relatives that BIL has in NYC?", "NTA\n\nIts your home and as such you are completely ok in saying 'no' for no other reason than you \"dont want to\"\n\nYou have NO requirement nor responsibility to open your home to family or friends to stay at (particularly if you wont be there) NO MATTER WHAT.\n\nI have always gone with my gut. The intuition is what nature has given us to alert us to danger or something not right.\n\nUnless you absolutely just dont want to (which is fine) maybe question your sister a bit more about why they are travelling, what they are thinking of doing, how long are they staying etc. It might bring out something that you can then pinpoint as to why your gut is telling you 'dont do it'.", "INFO What is your concern? It's your place so you definitely don't have to do it.

And your sister has accepted it with grace so there\u2019s no need to be accusing anyone of entitlement.\n\nBut. Why don\u2019t you want to? You seem to care for and respect your sister and her little fam. You aren\u2019t giving any sort of examples of crap she pulls that makes you not want her in your flat.\n\nSo while you don\u2019t have to let them stay there, theres no rules that say we cant be happy to let our sister who we love, use our empty flat for a couple weeks and help out family, knowing they wont abuse your place and its not putting you out in any way. \n\nSo whats the gut about the trip not being right?", "INFO: Since most of what you wrote regarding your family is about money, is that the issue here? What is it about your money or their money that has you so hung up you spent most of your post talking about money, rather than people?", "I mean, you do you, it's NTA, but personally I can't imagine not doing my sister a solid in this way.

Or are you not really close?", "NAH. It's your property,  you have final say in who stays in it. But she's not an AH for trying to save money when traveling to see family.

Yes, you are under no obligation to allow anyone who doesn\u2019t pay rent to stay in your apartment. However, you can\u2019t name any specific reason for saying no to an act of kindness for your sister that will not impose on, inconvenience, or cost you anything. So your choice is the very definition of asshole behavior.", "NTA - Most people regret not listening to a gut feeling. Besides, your house, your decision.

You don\u2019t want anyone in your space and that don\u2019t make you an AH either. No one is owed access to your property because you aren\u2019t using it at the time.\n\nI\u2019d worry that allowing your sister in would open the floodgates for requests from BIL\u2019s family.

Not that they are owed free accommodation but it could be a nice gesture.", "YTA\nThe tone of your post is strange to say the least. You've given no legitimate reason for saying no.

I think you are being incredibly mean. Of course you don't have to say yes, but why on earth would you not? I'm lucky to have an amazing sister and I wouldn't dream of ever saying no to anything she asked for as she has been so generous with me. \nI have no words. Can't understand how you can justify saying no. Really bad fucking karma. Really bad.", "INFO:  Do you have any reason to believe your sister\u2019s family would not treat your apartment with respect?\n\nIf the answer is no, I think you should let them stay as this is your sister ( I would not have the same answer for a cousin).

Before you change your mind, ask yourself several questions. Are you OK with everyone you know expecting that they can stay there for free? Will this increase your utility bill? Will your guests sign a contract agreeing to pay for cleaning and any damages? How will you know if anything is damaged? How do you know they will leave when they say they plan to?

Now, we have a rule. Only our parents can stay alone. It makes it clear and avoided conflicts.", "NTA\n\nNYC isn't going anywhere, so they can save a bit more to afford accommodations.  \n\nAlso BIL has family they can stay with in the US, ask to use their homes or ask for money to help subsidize the cost of the visit.", "Yta  you sound really condescending on this post , no real reasons why she can\u2019t stay , more obsessed with income etc very bizzare really hope your sister and her little family make it there without your help , and In the future you need nothing off them", "NTA. While it understandably made your sister feel a little hurt, you are in no way the asshole for not letting them stay. Sometimes you need to listen to your gut and make sure you protect yourself from anything bad that may happen. If he has family there, they can ask to stay with them. Its a hard decision to make, but they could have easily arranged it to see if they could stay with you when you were there rather than when you aren\u2019t there, which would help give you more control over their use of the space", "I mean technically and legally you are N T A but I'd personally and definitely let my sister stay at my place in the same situation.

The kids are monsters who have never heard the word \"no.\" They will get into everything, wrecki9g, stealing, and even flushing your jewelry down the loo.\n\nYes, we had a post on just that not long ago.\n\nIn short: there is no pro to this and a great deal of con.\n\nYou cannot leave others in charge of your place because YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN.\n\nDon't do it. Your sister can stay with her in-laws. Maybe there's a good reason why she thought they would say no to her, too.\n\nNTA.", "Hmmm, technically NTA, but, c\u2019mon, at least tell us why if you\u2019re on good terms with your sister.\n\nMaybe OP is doesn\u2019t want his sister to know just how wealthy she is because not many could afford a 3 bedroom apartment in NYC that\u2019s vacant 1/2 the year. \n\nOr maybe there is there something in or about the apartment that you\u2019d prefer remain private - even from your sister? Did OP convert one room into a dungeon? Does OP have expensive erotic/ nude art pieces? Of the same sex?\n\nOr maybe it\u2019s just that OP has lots of expensive things that a 1 year old can easily break?\n\nInquiring minds want to know!\n\nPersonally, I\u2019m hoping for a dungeon! \ud83e\udd1e", "What's the reasoning about not wanting them to stay? Are they messy people? Do you and your sister get along? What was your gut feeling?\n\nI'm not going to call you an AH but don't be upset is this strains the relationship you have with them", "I think it depends on your relationship with your sister and BIL. Have they done things in the past that give you cause not to trust them with your space? If you guys are close and there have not been prior issues, I personally would let them stay.  Obviously no one is entitled to your space regardless of differences in financial status, but if there\u2019s no good reason you could give them an opportunity they\u2019ve clearly been saving for and wanting to make happen that they might otherwise be unable to afford.", "So the make an earnest living and smart expenditures. Saved the money for an expensive trip and there is no reason to think they make a mess out of the apartment, because of previous behaviour? If this is the case, I feel OP is a little but unfair. Sure she is entitled to deny it, but still a unfair.", "YTA. Why can\u2019t you let them stay? Because something doesn\u2019t feel right? What kinda selfish ass excuse is that?", "Even the people saying N T A are qualifying that they don't agree with your choice. \n\nNo you don't HAVE to but you have no good reason to say no to YOUR SISTER. I'm with your BFF. YTA.", "Why would you not offer an empty apartment to your own sister and family? I'm really not understanding why not. Do you not get on, do you dislike her husband and child? This is very alien to me.", "Foreshadowing for the update\u2026 lmao", "Honestly, this is the biggest question for me,  \"we're going to visit family,  but not with them.\" Not to mention I'd imagine transportation with a baby in NYC would suck, and as op keeps her finances private, she'd probably have to fly there anyway to clean up any loose paperwork around the condo before her family decide to play detective.", "Perfect response. Bravo", "No need to suggest alternatives. That opens up a conversation about accommodation. Just say no if you want to say no.", "This opens a door for them to stay in your place with you.\n\nIf you don't want them to stay, regardless if you're around to keep an eye on everyone/everything, this is not the best response", "Yeah, this part sounds off to me too. Why don't they stay with his family if money is tight? It makes it look like they are expecting to stay a long time in his apartment without paying.\n\nI'd be okay with an immediate family member staying but I'd be a LOT less okay with it being in-laws plus kids. Who knows what shape it would be in when they finally left? Who knows what might end up getting broken and quietly thrown away?\n\nPlus, are they expecting that it will already be baby-proofed? What about the possible neighbor complaints over the baby crying while adjusting to the new environment?", "YTA.\n\nI can\u2019t imagine not letting my sister/ her husband stay at my apartment if I\u2019m away for a couple weeks and it would save them a chunk of change.\n\nYou have not written anything in your post that makes me think the sister is rude/dangerous/a complete dick. You never mentioned anything about how she treated you poorly or anything like that so I have to assume you have a good relationship with her. So seriously why can\u2019t they stay in your apartment for a week?\n\nYour place is yours. You are not obligated to let people stay there, but that does not mean you are not an asshole. It\u2019s also telling your friend in the UK (where your family is from and currently lives) also thinks your being a dick", "Yep. I don\u2019t get this. I would definitely (and have) let my family stay in my home while I\u2019m gone. I would not let them if there was some history of being terrible guests or inconsiderate or we had a bad relationship. But absent that, I love my family, and if I could help them without it impacting me like this, I would want to facilitate their visit.", "Yeah, I agree.\n\nIt's still her right to say no, but unless OP elaborates on this \"gut feeling\" about how something \"isn't right\" her reluctance to help out her family is a little bizarre. The apartment is just sitting empty, anyway.", "Well put!", "This right here! NYC has some of the strongest laws in favor of tenants and it would be actual hell getting them out.", "Lmao no not how that works.", "I once visited family friends w mom, 2 hr drive from home. She stopped for gas on the way home and thought I'd go into the convenience store after pumping gas but I felt like I shouldn't. \n\nWhen she came back to the car, she brought me the snack she expected me to come in to choose and asked why I didn't go in. When I told her I just felt like I shouldn't, she said always trust your gut.", "My issue with this post is that OP doesn't given context for these gut feelings. If their sister had a history of illegal activity, was showing signs of intending to squat in the apartment, I would understand. But up just says they have a bad feeling about it and presents no reason why.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/", "If they're going to visit family then why can't they stay with some of the family they're visiting?", "Yeah. I've crashed in so many friends' apartments in NYC when they were out of town, or even simply staying over with an SO. Hell, I once stayed at the apartment of my PARENT'S friend. I've done the same in return. \n\nI'd not go so far as to say OP is an ASSHOLE for saying no, but I do find it a bit bizarre, unless there's more context we're missing (sister+ fam are unreliable, reason to think they're going to attempt to take over the apartment long term, etc.).", "They\u2019re British tourists on a tourist visa.", "Not if they only have a tourist visa I expect.", "Because in NYC it\u2019s not very common to have enough space to host a goddamn family! And isn\u2019t OP family? Why wouldn\u2019t they want to stay there as a first option? They get their \u201cown\u201d space for a week and can meet all his family but still be able to be alone as a family as well\n\nI\u2019m very curious if anyone here realizes how much a 3 bed apartment in the middle of NYC costs? My sister and her husband pay 2500ish for a 1 Bed in manhattan so it\u2019s not like every family just has 2 extra rooms they can let someone stay in", "I wonder if the concern is that it won't just be sister, BIL and child at the apartment but many of BIL's family as well. More of a \"hey, we have an apt in downtown NYC - come hang out here\" kind of thing.", "You don't need two extra rooms for two adults and a child to sleep on vacation. If family doesn't have space for them then they'll have to save up some more for accommodations. It was fine for the sister to ask, but it's also fine for OP to say no.", "I\u2019m saying that OP has every right to say no but she is still TA because the only reason she gave is \u201cgut feeling\u201d which is complete shit considering nowhere has she said her sister or BIL or nephew has done anything wrong", "But OP doesn't need a reason to say no, and that still doesn't make her an asshole."]}
