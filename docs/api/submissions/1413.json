{"id": 1413, "submission_id": "ymf02v", "title": "AITA for 'humiliating' my friend at the bus stop?", "selftext": " I was bullied after being outed as bisexual. The bully joined my friend group last year and friends began avoiding me. We barely spoke and I began every conversation. Sometimes they'd walk away or say 'shut up'. I didn't say anything about it because I didn't want to argue. I noticed how the bully copied my mannerisms and things I did for friends like buying snacks. I was then excluded from group trips and games and if he was rude and I defended myself, I was called 'dramatic' and an 'overthinker'. If I retaliated, I was accused of 'overreacting' and 'instigating people against him'. My 15th birthday came so I organised a party. I wanted to reconnect with the group but they couldn't make it due to 'business'. I thought nothing until I was scrolling through Instagram and saw them having a get together. On other occasions I was met with the same excuses: 'sorry, I am busy' and 'sorry, I am looking after my grandma'. Every time I'd hear about it through the grapevine. This year, I hoped things would be different. I organised a party for my 16th and they cancelled at the last minute so I let them pick a date and venue too as they complained about the one I picked. At the last minute, they cancelled again. This time, they didn\u2019t even say anything. I finally asked why they had been distant and expressed how it was hurting me, they called me 'selfish' and 'inconsiderate'. I decided to be distanced from them hereon. During class, they tried speaking and when the teacher noticed, they yelled at me for speaking when I hadn't uttered a word. I said I didn't speak and it was Mya and Tereza (people in the group). I was met with yelling and a patronising comment about not understanding English well enough to be quiet. Mya and Tereza laughed and at this was when I decided to stop being their 'friend'. I messaged them that evening and said I was no longer going to tolerate the exclusion, verbal abuse and mistreatment. I called them snakes for getting me into trouble for their actions and blocked them. The next day, my pen broke. I asked three peers to lend me a pen, however Tereza and Mya whispered to all of them 'Don't give him a pen'. I got called names at break by peers so I approached Mya about this and she denied telling anyone. I got threatened during class. After school, I went to rehearse for my school show instead of going to Intervention (extra class). Mya waited outside and when one of my friends in Year 12 left, I saw Mya stop them. My Year 12 friend came back to tell me what she said. I went out and asked why she called for me. A teacher heard and Mya pretended I was blocking her exit when she was closer to the exit than me. Mya was escorted out of the building. Rehearsals ended and Mya was waiting for me. She tried argue so I yelled. I got home and had messages accusing me of 'humiliating Mya at the bus stop'. I saw screenshots of things Mya and Tereza had said about me. One said 'Michael was right about him. I wish Ciaran would disappear.'
