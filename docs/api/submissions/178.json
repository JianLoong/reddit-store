You don\u2019t compare what you did to what she does or wants to do. It shows how little you think of her ideas. If she wants to get a tutor have a conversation about what she needs to do before you get her a tutor and if she can\u2019t follow through with those things than she isn\u2019t ready for a tutor. List the tic toks or whatever she can do to show she is serious.", "I'm going to say NTA.  Normally I'd be all for your daughter taking extra steps to learn another language. But from what you've indicated here Emily currently lacks the maturity to get any real value from the lessons.  I would make her an offer:  have her download Duolingo (it's free) and see if she can make a commitment to that:  it keeps track of your streak (how many days in a row you meet your goals).  If she cannot commit to something like that, she's not ready for private lessons.", "NTA\n\n> I tried to explain to her that even with private lessons she must study at home but she doesn\u2019t believe me.\n\nThis says all there is to me.  She's not trying to study/learn on her own.  Having a private tutor/private lessons is not going to do much if she isn't willing to commit to spending time studying on her own.", "NTA.  At 14, she should understand that you only get good at things by practice.  Perhaps an easy way out would be to contact a few private teachers and have them provide you docs where they suggest how many hours of independent study and practice are recommended each week to get good results.", "I'm going with NTA because I'm taking everything you say here as completely factual, but it's close to an ESH. As someone who did not do well in school based language, a tutor might actually benefit her.  Having someone to talk to  one to one instead of group \"repeat after me\" and vocabulary. If it's within your budget, it might be something worth trying. Maybe as an actual trial to just do like 1-2 months and see if there are improvements. Your own experience learning other languages is just that, your own. Everyone learns differently.", "NTA. If she was willing to do all the extra work, I\u2019d be supportive of paying for lessons. The lack of desire for the extra work/learning activities doesn\u2019t give me a good outlook on the effort that will be put in towards working with a tutor. Takes a lot more than just speaking with someone for an hour or two per week to learn a language", "NTA. You're right. But good luck convincing a teenager...", "ESH- Okay OP, you're not an AH for refusing to pay for private lessons, but your conversation with her could've been a helluva lot more productive.\n\nIf she's really wanting to learn Spanish, then it's worth maybe setting up an ultimatum. If she's willing to study on her own (with your help finding resources) and *prove* that she's willing to commit, then at that point you could discuss the cost of splitting lessons with your ex. \n\nI'm a smart cookie, but I have trouble with foreign languages (honestly, maths and sciences are *so much easier*), and a one on one tutor would've been *really* helpful before I went on foreign exchange. \n\nI think that you should try to show your daughter that she *can* do a lot of this on her own, and then see if she keeps pressing about the tutor. Make her earn it! Also, make your ex split the cost with you if you do ultimately get her one.", "NTA. She isn't willing to study (or even believe that she would have to to learn a language). Maybe if she put some effort in on her own, you'd support extra lessons? But why a \"private tutor\" when there are group classes and conversation groups available all over the place?", "Math tutor here and I completely agree with your thinking! I\u2019m always telling my students/parents that they still need to out in extra effort at home without me on a daily basis to really make noticeable improvements\u2014which I walk them through explicitly. Tutoring is a privilege and students need to put in the effort to warrant that privilege.\n\nWith that said, kids don\u2019t listen to parents \ud83e\udd23. So reframe it as I want to make sure you\u2019re fully committed to what the tutor will ask of you (find one that does assign at home work), so you need to do X, Y, and Z first. Full-stop. \n\nNTA", "ESH. You are an AH for saying that she can't have lessons because they're a waste of money and then bragging about how you learned two languages etc. Stop comparing her to you, she's a kid for goodness sake. It's not a competition.\n\nBut she needs to know that she needs to do more to actually learn the language. However, a tutor could take responsibility for this. Tell her that the tutor will monitor her progress and report back about whether she needs to do additional studying at home. If she doesn't listen to the tutor's recommendations, she loses the tutor. \n\nAnd your ex is a bit of an AH for suggesting that this is your daughter's dream. If it was, she'd do everything in her power to learn, including studying at home.", "YTA \n\nYou state that you can afford it but the reason you don't want to provide them is because you don't think she will find them useful.\n\nThere is an easy fix for that - fund them for a few months and see if she is willing to do whatever homework the tutor wants so that she is making some progress. You and the tutor or teacher and your daughter can decide on what is reasonable in terms of her progress and how much work at home should be done.", "YTA\n\nYour child is wanting lessons in an academic subject, you can afford it, and you are saying \"no\"?\n\nWhat's wrong with you?\n\nNot everyone can learn independently or by studying on their own.  Your daughter knows what her best learning methods are.\n\nBut a child who wants to learn and study should be encouraged, not shut down.  \n\nIf she's taking classes at school, and feels she needs help, get her that help!  \n\nShaming her for not having the same learning style as you is pointless, cruel, and counterproductive to her intellectual development.", "The problem that I see (and I could be wrong) is she doesn\u2019t want to put in the extra work beyond the extra lessons. It\u2019s strictly the lessons she wants, and doesn\u2019t realize that the tutor may give her extra assignments as well. I\u2019m going with NTA.", "Having someone else she can converse with is more effective than learning alone at home.  YTA.", "YTA\n\nJust because you were able to do something extraordinary doesn't mean she will be able to.", "Do you have a budget for activities or for education or for her in general that has space that could be used on this? \n\nN T A for not getting your kid a tutor but maybe YTA for how you went about dismissing her", "YTA. Just because *you* had no problem learning another language on your own does not mean your daughter can do the same. You say she doesn't practice at home, but how could you, someone who only sees her 4 days a month, possibly know what she does at home? You have no idea what's going in n when she's at home and not visiting you.\n\nYou should be happy that she's interested in improving her Spanish with a private tutor. And yes, private lessons do make a difference.", "YTA. Just because you're apparently the world's smartest person doesn't mean your child is.", "Can you afford them?", "INFO: Is Spanish one of the languages you know?", "YTA not everyone learns the same way. The fact that you use the word \"tantrum\" is quite telling against YOU, not her. You could pay for the lessons with the stipulation that she meets some basic criteria (hours spent per week studying on her own, writing a simple paragraph in Spanish describing something she did that week, etc.) Instead you label her as having \"tantrums\" and claim that she should learn exactly like you do.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Save private tutoring for when/if she needs it to better a school grade.", "She may get excited to learn and practice with a good teacher. If not, stop the lessons. It\u2019s not a gym membership that you can never cancel.", "YTA Not everyone can pick it up from their own and offering to help her usually won't work as most kids don't like their parents lecturing more at them.  Wanting to learn from a tutor is half the battle really, and your child is there already.  Your daughter is open to the tutors learning style and tutors are benefitable as they can break it down in manageable lots.\n\nThe student knows the tutor isn't going to yell, get frustrated at them.  Your daughter is concerned at your reactions and as a result doesn't think you'd be a great teacher for her.  \n\nYou could put out place cards on objects once the tutoring starts.", "Stupid question, if you are fluent in two languages besides English, why didn't you teach at least one of them to your daughter?\n\nI am a native English speaker, but fluent in Spanish. I only speak Spanish to my kids, unless non-speakers are around. My kids understand oral Spanish, but respond to me in English because it is easier for them.

She isn't doing any work now, what would make dad think she would if they were private lessons? OP, look up the DuoLingo app.", "A tutor is definitely beneficial, IF the student is also willing to put in the work outside of classes.\n\nBut if you're just having a class a week and then refusing to practice outside of class, then it's definitely a waste of money. You can't learn a language without practicing consistently", "Completely agree. If this is something she really wants then 100% OP you should try to make it happen for her. But there's nothing wrong with asking her to make a show of good faith that she is actually committed.\n\nSet some milestones for her to accomplish before paying for the lessons. Studying for 20 min twice a week, getting to a certain level on a language app, watching media in Spanish twice a week, etc.", "I think the issue is that she's not willing to put in the at-home work. I'm a huge fan of language learning but just taking lessons without any actual practice won't lead to good retention.   \n\n\nIt's a bit like art - you can take classes on painting, but if you don't actually practice painting you won't get any better.", "Yes, I could pay for it.\n\nI tried to explain to her many times how learning languages works but she\u2019s just not listening.", "Yes.", "It is. I offered to help her but she refuses. She believes that lessons with private tutors should be enough and no matter how much is explain it to her, she doesn\u2019t think she has to study on her own, she just thinks she\u2019ll absorb it from private classes.", "But the daughter is already stating she won't spend any time studying on her own. It seems that OPs point is a tutor won't help if she doesn't practice herself too, which is absolutely true.\n\nNo reason to waste money on a tutor if she can't prove that she actually will practice.", "What\u2019s the YouTube channel called?", "I agree that duolingo is a bad way to learn a language.\n\nThe issue is that she doesn\u2019t think she needs to do anything if at home. She believes that she\u2019s just going to absorb the knowledge from talking with a private tutor. No matter how many times I explained to her that it\u2019s not how it works, she\u2019s not having it. She thinks I\u2019m old fashioned and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about.", "It\u2019s terrible for learning a language you don\u2019t know but it\u2019s actually pretty good as a supplementary tool. If you already have a background in the language and are just rusty or learning a new dialect or you mainly use speaking skills but are looking to practice reading / translation etc - it\u2019s great for that. For a kid that\u2019s learning Spanish in school I actually think it would do a lot more than you\u2019d first assume. \n\nHere it sounds like daughter is annoyed she doesn\u2019t feel she\u2019s moving fast enough and this could help her at least feel she\u2019s progressing quicker than she is. It\u2019ll gameify practice and if she ends up actually realizing she wants to reach fluency - she\u2019ll probably be looking for additional practice and enrichment on her own, even going with some of op\u2019s suggestions. \n\nOp could also potentially look into an immersion type program down the line if she shows commitment and still has trouble with finding ways to practice at home. But your suggestion is such a great way to get her to show responsibility and show she\u2019s going to be taking any further opportunities for learning seriously", "I had a hard time in a classroom for most subjects. The standard chalkboard method puts me sleep even if it\u2019s a subject I\u2019m interested in. I would have benefitted greatly with a tutor I think. But yeah, a tutor can\u2019t make you learn if you aren\u2019t interested.", "What these two said! And also, bring into the conversation your ex. He also needs to pay half.", "Not everyone learns that way.\n\nAnd, particularly for languages, actual conversation and interaction with someone who is fluent in the language is not something that can be substituted by homework assignments.  \n\nThe daughter has expressed interest in learning and requested help in a form she believes will best let her master the subject.\n\nThis needs to be encouraged.  How many teenagers ask for extra studies? \n\nAnd even if OP could teach themself a language, it doesn't mean his daughter has the same learning style and can duplicate the situation.", "Would you pay for her to do something that was just for fun, like archery or ballet or going regularly to the cinema?", "It might be worth it to get a private tutor that will tell her that unless she practices and puts the effort in, she won't be able to learn it.  I got As all 4 years in Spanish.  Do I speak it?  No.  You can't learn a language without practicing it.  If she committed to doing all the work necessary, then you could try it for a few months then evaluate it.  NTA", "NTA then, I wish my mother had taught me Italian as a kid, it would have made it so much easier when I was in school. I would just start talking to her in Spanish whether she likes it or not. She'll see the value in learning from you PDQ. I picked up a bit of Spanish from a Peruvian woman I used to work with that way, and she learned a fair bit of English me.", "Can you just give up custody?", "Conversational practice is important. You don\u2019t happen to speak Spanish, do you?", "Don't get me wrong, I think tutors are amazing. That personal focus does absolute wonders.\n\nIt's just in this case that I mean it'd be pointless - unless she's having a tutor a couple hours very day, she can't learn a language just from the tutor. You need to reinforce it and practice it consistently", "There is an enormous amount of memorization at the beginner stage of language learning.  Anyone who states at the outset that they will never practice or study outside of class is guaranteeing failure.  Most people can not afford lessons every day.  But a lesson once a week with no outside work is a waste of time.   Progress is impossible.  OP is absolutely correct.  If your kid wanted guitar lessons, but also said they would never touch the guitar between lessons, would you go out and buy a guitar?  I worked at a language school for a decade.  There are many kinds of learners and teaching styles.  But the no work outside of class approach is not legitimate.", "When learning languages, the early lessons, for me, were not lists of memorization, but rather practicing basic conversations.\n\nI suppose it depends on the teacher, and their teaching style.\n\nBut, either way, OP's daughter has said \"I want to study this, please help me learn\" and OP has said \"NO, unless you learn the way I did.\"\n\nThat's crap, and OP needs to support their daughter wanting to learn, no matter what tools (such as tutors) the daughter needs."]}
