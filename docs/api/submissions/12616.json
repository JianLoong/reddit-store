I work a lot and I've been lucky enough to save and to buy my appartement recently. One thing I was sure about when looking for my place was that I wanted a balcony in order to smoke outside so that my place doesnt smell like an ashtray.\n\nThis morning I was smoking and my neighbour comes at her window and starts pestering me and telling me im an awful person for smoking on my balcony because the smell comes in her appartement. I told her that I was very sorry and that I understand the cigarette smell is very bad but im not going to smoke inside my appartement or go in the street (6th floor no elevator). I said sorry several times and told her the only solution that I could think about was for her to close her window five minutes. She then proceeded to tell me that it was crazy that I was expecting her to do something to accomodate me and that I should go smoke in my appartment and that I was not caring for her. At this point she was very angry and saying nasty stuff. So I told her she was very aggressive in the morning and she should rather close her window and do a 5min meditation.\nIn the end she blew up at me and as I finishedy cigarette I went inside.\n\nIm torn because I understand cigarette smell bad and that's the very reason I bought an appartement with a balcony so I get that she's frustrated. But I also cant help to think it's silly. \n\nEdit : just a little clarifications, we dont live in the same building/appartement, her window is about 3-4 meters away from my balcony. \n\nSo AITA ?", "created_utc": 1679127994, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11uie83/aita_for_smoking_at_my_balcony/", "score": 219, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I bought three and put them in my office. And only smoked in there.  It worked really well and was worth the 1000 bucks. \n\nThat being said. I quit in November and feel sooo much better!  And my doctor is happy! And I\u2019m not stinky when I kiss people!", "My neighbour smokes in her courtyard which is directly beside my bedroom and lounge room windows. I keep those windows closed except when I know she\u2019s out or away. She\u2019s entitled to use her space however she legally wants. \nNTA", "NTA - Non-smoker opinion\u2026 As long as what you\u2019re doing is not prohibited, I see no issue. She can close her window while you smoke. I see this as no different than if the parking lot were to receive a new layer of stinky tar, or if loud construction were occurring. Get yourself a nice set of noise canceling headphones so you don\u2019t have to hear her noise pollution while you smoke in peace on your balcony.", "NTA. It's your balcony, you paid for it.", "I'm currently at my parents' because my mom had a stroke and I need to take care of her. Their downstairs neighbors smoke and it all come up here. My nose is completely blocked all day, every day, even though I go through a bottle of saline a week to wash it inside. I can't eat if they smoke at meal times because my tongue tastes like ashtrays and starts to tingle, I'm having chest pains, sleep apnea, and high blood pressure issues. I just had surgery to cut off my nasal turbinates in October and be able to breathe, after chronic exposure to flowers made them grow and block my nose, and I feel like I'm back to not breathing again. I wear N95 masks inside the home and sometimes the only think that helps is to sit with my face to a fan to try to keep the smoke away from me.", "YTA\nWhy do you smoke on your balcony?\n\nBecause you dont want the smell in your flat. \nSo why do you think your neighbor want your cigarette smell in there flat?", "YTA - it\u2019s probably making your own apartment smell too but as a non smoker she will be able to smell it far more clearly than you. Even very small amounts of smoke getting into her apartment will stick to soft furnishings and linger for long after you\u2019ve finished your cigarette.\n\nAnd that\u2019s aside from any health effects she may experience from it. I have a hypersensitivity to perfumes and smoke, and had neighbours who smoked out of a window for ages and it used to get into my apartment and set off coughing fits and headaches for me even if I had the window closed while they were actually smoking because the vents to the bathroom and kitchen were at that side of the building so their smoke could get into my home anyway.\n\nIt meant I was unable to manage my own health inside my home properly.\n\nSmoking is a luxury and a habit, not a necessity. It\u2019s also a fire risk to the whole block; but that\u2019s a secondary issue here. If it\u2019s worth it to you, go outside to smoke. If it isn\u2019t, start vaping for nicotine or give up your habit.", "NTA. My condo neighbours used to smoke indoors and it was gross. You are outside. What you do outside is your business, as long as there are no rules or bylaws against it.", "YTA. You don't want your apartment to smell like cigarettes, yet you're making their apartment smell like it. And probably every single day in summer. I don't smoke and I had this situation in my previous apartment. It feels like someone is intruding your home all the time.\n\nI don't see how it is any different from blasting music at 3a.m. Yes you paid for the apartment and you're allowed to play music from it. But if anything travels from your apartment to another (sound, smell, etc) that is unwanted, you need to talk to them and find a solution rather than saying \"I will keep doing it\".\n\nSo the window option, that feels the same as saying I will keep blasting my music and you can wear earplugs. Not really a solution for both parties. Only on your end. \n\nTalk to your neighbours, be more considerate. Find out if there is a time of day were it may be less of an issue. And perhaps sit by another window sometimes and accept a little bit of smell in your own apartment. Cross the street every once in a while for it when it's nice weather.", "NTA. As someone who lives above someone who smokes in their unit, and causes smoke to come into my unit and the one in between us, I\u2019m grateful for people like you who know it\u2019s not okay to smoke inside.", "YTA maybe because of my culture but I don't see why she must suffer with 2nd hand smoke because of you? If you wanna die early do it by yourself don't need to drag other people down with you too", "Nta. Opening the window when you have neighbors close by means that you\u2019re gonna have to smell whatever is going on outside, whether it\u2019s barbecue, cigarettes, or their garden. If she has an issue, maybe she should move somewhere more spacious or close her window. Apartment living is not always ideal, because sometimes your lifestyle is going to be integrated with your neighbors.  It\u2019s just a part of living in an apartment", "YTA\n\nYou don't want stinking cigarette smoke smelling up your apartment, but you don't mind being inconsiderate and making your neighbours apartments smelling of stinking cigarette smoke.", "Hard to say \n\nOn one hand it\u2019s your apartment and your balcony. You pay for it and you should use it how you wish. \n\nOn the other- you live in an apartment. It\u2019s a shared space. What you do is going to effect others in your space if it\u2019s smoking, cooking pungent food, and noise of any kind. It\u2019s courtesy to be mindful of how what you\u2019re doing is effecting others. \n\nYet the same is applied conversely. It\u2019s a shared space and if you don\u2019t want to be effected by smells, noises, etc. then you shouldn\u2019t be in a place where that can happen. \n\nSo I guess at the end of the day NAH. \n\nBut be prepared to have this neighbor to have it out for you.", "NTA. /she can \\*ask\\* but you can say No. Nothing to apologize for either. I'd put up a screen or something so I could use my balcony in private.", "NAH.  As a non-smoker, I think OP has every right to smoke on their own balcony.  It sucks for the woman in the next building, but she can close her window for a few minutes.  In her place, I'd try to work out a schedule of sorts, maybe hour blocks for your usual smoking times.  Perhaps you can invest in a small fan to blow the smoke in another direction.", "As someone with respiratory issues who had to live next to chain smokers, I can\u2019t stress how big of an asshole you are. YTA, a hundred times over.", "NTA. I get that she doesn't like it, but when you live someplace where neighbors are that close you have to expect that you will sometimes smell something you don't like.\n\nI live in a big city with buildings close together and can't stand the smell of people cooking meat. It literally makes me want to vomit. It's not like I'm going to go out there everytime someone want to have a BBQ and tell them they can't do something that they are legally allowed to do, I just close my window until they stop. If I wanted to live somewhere where I didn't have to worry about smelling something I find to be gross I'd move to a more rural area where buildings are farther apart.", "I won\u2019t pass judgement as I\u2019m a smoker but I will say you should sit just inside your balcony doors and blow the smoke outside\u2026 problem solved. She won\u2019t be able to complain about the same thing then \ud83d\ude02", "I'm leading towards YTA. Yes I understand it's your balcony, but I feel like smokers forget how numb they are to the smell of that shit. As bad as it smells to you OP ( clearly enough that you don't want it in YOUR apartment) it is much more pungent and disgusting when you don't smoke at all and are forced to be around it. If my apartment constantly smelled like cigarettes bc my neighbor decided THEIR apartment was too good to smoke in, I would be pissed too. To be fair idk how often you are smoking, but if it's often then pls find some way to help the issue. Have you considered switching to vapes maybe? Idk how different they are from cigarettes so idk if that's a good alternative but it might be worth a try.", "NTA and I am amazed at a these YTA votes. It's your balcony you should be able to smoke there without being guilt tripped. If the smell bothers your neighbour they just have to close the window for a few minutes, it'd take less than 10 minutes to smoke a cigarette outside and have the smell blow away.", "YTA.  In the situation described, you might as well be smoking right outside your neighbor's apartment and deliberately blowing all your smoke directly into her apartment.\n\nYou have two choices.  Go to the ground floor, walk outside and smoke far away from the building (AT LEAST 15 METERS)  Your other choice is to smoke inside of your apartment  with all the doors and windows closed, so that the smoke stays entirely in your apartment.\n\nThe AH move is to smoke on your balcony when your nearby neighbors have their windows open.   And no, suggesting that they close their windows is not a valid solution.  They should not have to do anything to enable your nasty habits.", "NTA as a smoker I smoke a lot outside out respect of my husband ( allergic) . We lived in an apartment but I had to go outside to smoke ( like 4 apartments in a house type thing) I had to deal with the same type of person . They complained to landlord and the landlord told them that I pay my rent every month and I have all right to do as I wish anywhere outside or in the hall or in my apartment and if she doesn\u2019t like it then to open a different window.", "How is the smell going in their apartment when you're smoking in the balcony in open air? I've lived in apartments my whole life, didn't hear nothing like this. People would only complain if you don't use ashtrays and the ash goes in their own balcony. It's your right to do whatever the fuck you want in your own damn apartment that you paid for you don't have to be sorry for nothing. NTA.", "YTA and so is everyone else saying \u201cIt\u2019s your balcony, you paid, etc\u2026\u201d Cool that means OPs neighbors can blast death metal on their balconies from 10pm to 6 am every night because even though the sound travels and disturbs the neighbors like op\u2019s smelly smoke does, it\u2019s their balcony and they paid after all.", "NTA and I don\u2019t smoke. She can ask, and you can decline. As long as there\u2019s no building rules stating you can\u2019t smoke on the balcony, then you\u2019re not doing anything wrong, and I\u2019m sure your building owners would prefer if you didn\u2019t smoke inside your apartment too. The lady can be mad all she wants,  but that\u2019s just part of multi-family living. It won\u2019t kill her to close her window when you smoke. I\u2019m getting the vibe that most of the people saying YTA are just being judgmental because they don\u2019t agree with smoking at all.", "NAH. Even as an ex smoker, it's your balcony and this stuff is part of living in close quarters with people. My only issue would be if she has a baby because of the second hand smoke risks.", "Neighbour can close her window for 5 mins if it bothers her and not be so precious about it \ud83d\ude44\n\nNTA", "NAH\n\nYou have a right to smoke on your balcony, but she's allowed to be upset that her apartment now smells like smoke. \n\nBack when I used to smoke, I confined it to one room and used one of those little smokeless ashtrays that was battery operated and had a fan. Blow the smoke towards it and rest your cigarette in it between drags. Cuts down on a surprising amount of the smoke and the smell. I'm sure the lady and probably your other neighbors would appreciate it.", "NTA. You own your apartment, and can do what you want on your balcony. I've face this before and just closed my window, opened it a bit later. No big.", "NTA\n\nIf the property does not prohibit smoking, then there's going to be the risk of odors such as cigarette smoke coming in should your neighbour choose to open their window. If she does not want to run this risk, she should consider living somewhere that prohibits smoking. Closing the window seems reasonable, albeit mildly inconvenient for the neighbour. \n\nExpecting to be able to smoke on your apartment balcony is not unreasonable. \n\nSmoking indoors would cause odors in the neighbouring units, much worse than smoke coming in an open window would cause to a unit across the way.\n\nGoing to ground level when you live on the 6th floor is unreasonable.", "NTA, it's your balcony. Also the neighbour sounds quite aggressive. To keep the peace you could buy a ventilator to blow the smoke in another direction", "It's your balcony. You can do what you want.  But if I was the neighbor, I'd cook fish every night with a fan in the window blowing right into your balcony every time you were out there or had your window open.", "NTA it's your apartment and your balcony. Just ignore her", "YTA - You are stinking up another person\u2019s place with foul smelling carcinogens so that your place doesn\u2019t smell foul.\n\nAs a general rule smokers should do whatever they can to keep the smell away from anyone that does not like it.\n\nQuitting is hard, but worth it. Women in their late 30s and older that smoke have the ugliest wrinkled mouths. Stop now before that happens to you. If you can't stop, smoke inside.", "NTA\n\nShe can close her window if it bothers her. Her argument is weak. I used to live within a few miles of a sugar beet factory which put out some awful smells for miles around. Good luck forcing them to relocate to the middle of nowhere because 'I shouldn't have to do anything to accommodate them'.", "Nta in my opinion. I personally wouldn't accommodate her since she couldn't have a conversation with you like a normal person and immediately got pissy instead. Also in all of my experiences with balconies I've never had a problem with anyones smoke getting stuck in my room?? (maybe just me ofc, could've had more air flow)", "YTA. that smell is horrific and gets through windows. I have been fighting with a neighbor over this. We live in a non-smoking building so he\u2019s violating lease but it does not stop. \n\nCigarette smoke triggers my migraines. You have no idea how awful it is", "NTA former smoker myself. Had an same experience with an neighbour. It is your balcony dont feel bad, but she will be an ass from now on.....", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH, op. Sadly this is the issue with apartment complexes. Smells and sounds travel. As long as what you\u2019re doing is legal, your neighbour can\u2019t say shit. If someone is sensitive to noise and smells.. well they should\u2019ve looked into it before moving to an apartment complex", "NTA I can\u2019t stand the smell of cigarette smoke but people have the right to do what they want on their property. It\u2019s gross for the neighbors and inconvenient to have to close their window for sure but they live in a world where you\u2019re not entitled for everyone to do what you want and where you want it. That\u2019s life get over it. That being said maybe you can put a fan on Your balcony to blow the smoke away quickly in another direction. Good luck and congratulations on your new home.", "NTA . Your balcony.", "I get both sides. Hopefully, it provides you motivation to smoke less.", "Nta\u2026.. YTA votes need to get a grip", "I mean technically NTA if your apartment allows smoking (some don\u2019t allow it even on the balcony so maybe check your lease) but also kinda YTA because it\u2019s a disgusting habit that you\u2019re still making your neighbor smell even if you are outside. If I were you I would just try to be polite and go down off the property. I know that\u2019s more inconvenient but you\u2019re the smoker so it kind of falls on you. Technically you don\u2019t have to do anything if the lease says you\u2019re allowed to smoke on your balcony but also super inconsiderate to push that dirty habit on your neighbors. It\u2019s the worst smell in the world and second hand smoke still causes cancer. This is one of those examples of just not being a good neighbor, of course no one wants to smell that", "Quite frankly I think any circumstance where you are forcing second hand tobacco or weed on another person is an arsehole move. But I have been raised in a country with pretty serious rules around smoking proximity.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re making someone else smell that, when you\u2019ve already said you don\u2019t want to in your own apartment", "YTA - yes, you are the asshole for exposing other humans to carcinogens and potentially actually contributing to others developing cancer. There\u2019s a reason many cities have laws about smoking with X feet of buildings", "YTA. Yes, it is your apartment but it's not *just* your apartment, if the smoke gets to where your neighbour can smell and complain about it. \n\nSmoking one or two times a day and expecting your neighbour to close the window then, that's reasonable. However smoking 5-8 times a day and expecting your neighbour to close the window during that time is excessive. Cut back, for your own health and your and your neighbours happiness.\n\nGoing to the street to smoke is not a good option, because there's far more people down there it affects/annoys than if you'd do it in your apartment. Is there a roof you have access to where you could smoke?\n\nAnother option would be to switch to vapes. Be careful with dosage and ingredients with those though. As a non smoker who is extremely repulsed by the smell of smoke and feels like I can't breathe when I smell it, vapes are so much better than cigarettes, at least for the people who have to smell them.", "the people in here saying yta are wilddddddd. if you smoked inside it would be WAY worse, for you, your landlord and your neighbors. i smoked myself and quit (hate the smell) you know what i do when some random person in public is smoking? roll my windows up. NTA at all op, keep smoking on your balcony and if lady has an issue she can close her window up", "NTA - based on this single interaction. It is your property, you paid for it, there is now law against it. You enjoy the way you want.\n\nHaving said that, it is also important to respect others, both ways.\n\nIf, like me, you smoke one in the morning and one at night, I think you are absolutely in the right and it is reasonable to ask the neighbour to suck it up.\n\nIf, like my guy downstairs, you smoke a pack a day throughout the day, than you getting in to AH territory.", "I\u2019m honestly baffled at this one.

When you live in an apartment building you\u2019re just going to have to cope with the the fact that other people also live in that building.

I work a lot and I've been lucky enough to save and to buy my appartement recently. One thing I was sure about when looking for my place was that I wanted a balcony in order to smoke outside so that my place doesnt smell like an ashtray.\n\nThis morning I was smoking and my neighbour comes at her window and starts pestering me and telling me im an awful person for smoking on my balcony because the smell comes in her appartement. I told her that I was very sorry and that I understand the cigarette smell is very bad but im not going to smoke inside my appartement or go in the street (6th floor no elevator). I said sorry several times and told her the only solution that I could think about was for her to close her window five minutes. She then proceeded to tell me that it was crazy that I was expecting her to do something to accomodate me and that I should go smoke in my appartment and that I was not caring for her. At this point she was very angry and saying nasty stuff. So I told her she was very aggressive in the morning and she should rather close her window and do a 5min meditation.\nIn the end she blew up at me and as I finishedy cigarette I went inside.\n\nIm torn because I understand cigarette smell bad and that's the very reason I bought an appartement with a balcony so I get that she's frustrated. But I also cant help to think it's silly. \n\nSo AITA ?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Do you think people who fart are selfish too? What if OP loved to eat tons of healthy broccoli, then went to her balcony every so often to pass the inevitable paint peeling gas that would result, and the neighbor was bothered by the smell? You\u2019re just being smug and sanctimonious because you have a bias against smokers and not thinking critically.

YTA, have respect for others and their health.", "So you want to keep having more issues when you admit you are wrong for blowing smoke on her apartment? \n\nLook, she shouldn't call you names, but keeping conflict just to be petty is ridiculous. You are an adult. Act like it.

Day or night.  Sometimes people like fresh air.", "How is opening the windows a safety hazard though? In my country most people's windows are open during the day to let breeze in? As long as you don't have some random open flames around I don't see the problem honestly. And I'm not sure what point you're trying to make with the smokers and drunkards part, ideally I would have a neighbour who doesn't smoke or drink. Yes, she cannot control the breeze, and that's why OP is AH for smoking since it'll enter her house against her will. Are you agreeing with me or what?", "Yeah, but if they can smell the smoke, that means that they're dealing with secondhand smoke. There's a good saying that one person's freedom ends when it impeding another person's freedom. Subjecting another person, on their own property, to the side effects of their habit is an AH move. And yeah, I get it that not everyone can afford a stand alone home with property. But we have to live according to our situation. There are things I enjoy that I didn't do when I lived in an apartment because I didn't want to be an AH. That just comes with the territory. There's also a reason a lot of places don't allow smoking in close places like that, even on balconies.

If a person wants to kill themselves sucking on the tailpipe of a car, they don't have the right to do so outside of my window.  If this was a person running their car and filling a neighbor's house with fumes, no one would argue. In all practicality, there really is no difference. Both are noxious fumes that are deadly to breath.  Period.", "Well said!", "If she is physically on the balcony and the building isn\u2019t smoke free from a formal policy she has no obligation to not smoke on the balcony that she pays rent for. And walls definitely aren\u2019t smoke proof so smoking inside is not a logical option. I have lived in city apartments for 2.5 years, I hate cigarette smoke. I also recognize as a reasonable human that my neighbors also pay rent for their space and if they want to enjoy a cigarette or cigar on their balcony, they have every right to do so. If I cared so deeply, I would choose to live in a smoke free community. The neighbor is being unreasonable and her behavior was inappropriate.

Why not buy a cheap small fan you can plug and keep the smoke away from the window? Like, it doesn't need to be something super expensive.", "The two aren't mutually exclusive.

In spaces like this there are general rules and guidelines to be not an asshole. There are noise ordinances and yes, measures to make sure everyone is living in a safe space and are not inhaling noxious fumes in their own home. If you want to smoke freely without anyone telling you off get your own land and home and keep your stench to yourself.\n\nThe fact that people like you and OP are not willing to stench up your own home by smoking inside but are perfectly fine doing so to other people says volumes. \n\nBBQs that create smoke every day aren\u2019t allowed inside flats either.
