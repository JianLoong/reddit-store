{"id": 11197, "submission_id": "11f341z", "title": "AITA for chucking a pet poop bag into middle of the street?", "selftext": "Throwaway account\u2026\n\nMy wife (33F) and I (33M) recently moved into a townhouse in a new neighborhood about half a year ago. Every week, we move our trash containers to the street for trash removal on the assigned day and then return the containers to our yard afterwards.\n\nHowever, in 3 of these instances, I noticed a bag of poop (probably from a dog) in the bottom of our freshly emptied trash container (we don\u2019t own a pet). The first 2 times, I disposed of the bag in our next week\u2019s trash pickup. But the third time, I had dumped the bag out onto the street while emptying the container of standing water (it had been raining with the lid open). When the bag came out, I used a shovel to chuck the bag into the middle of the road.\n\nMy reasoning is that whoever put the bag of poop into our empty private trash container without our permission didn\u2019t put it into a valid public trash container, so I assisted the bag to get to its final destination (the public street) as if my trash container didn\u2019t exist; I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s my responsibility to properly dispose of someone else\u2019s pet poop.\n\nMy wife told me that I am littering, but I countered by saying that the poop bag thrower is the litterer because they didn\u2019t dispose of their waste in a proper receptacle and instead trespassed by disposing it in our private, freshly emptied trash containers, which were on the public street for disposal day. I plan to try to find out who is the poop bag thrower in the near future and ask them to not throw their waste in our trash container, but will continue to chuck their improperly disposed poop bag into the street in the meantime.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit 1: based on the comments, I see that while the pet owner sucks for disposing their pet poop in my can, I am also the AH for throwing it into the street. I will figure out a solution that doesn\u2019t punish the entire neighborhood for the pet owner\u2019s entitled poop dumping.", "created_utc": 1677675434, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11f341z/aita_for_chucking_a_pet_poop_bag_into_middle_of/", "score": 1530, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

OP was the one throwing it into an empty bin and people practically crucified them. If someone doesn\u2019t have dogs, then they obviously didn\u2019t sign up for dog crap in an empty bin. Now if it was practically full and by the road to be taken out, then OP here would be the AH. It\u2019s common courtesy that if your dog poops, you dispose of it in an appropriate bin (Either yours, or one that\u2019s about to be taken out). Throwing it into an empty one is rude, as the smell permeates through the bag. I would suggest you let a bag of crap bake in summer heat for a day in a trash can, then carry that same opinion of caking OP an AH", "ESH.\n\nI can\u2019t stand people using other trashcans for their poop.  But throwing it in the street sucks too.\n\nPut a sign on your can.", "ESH.\n\nYes, it's really annoying that they do this. I get it, I get the same thing and it sucks. But dumping shit onto the street won't undo what they did and now you are also an asshole.", "ESH. \n\nThem for using your can without permission.  It's valid to not want poop bags in your trash for week. \n\nYou for the childish way you're handling the situation.", "I would be really annoyed if someone put their pet waste in my newly emptied trash can, too. Yes, many people purchase their own trash cans, and many of us want our trash cans to remain relatively clean if we store them inside a garage between weekly pickups.\n\nA better solution would be to retrieve your trash can from the curb right after pickup. If this is not possible due to scheduling (maybe you are already at work when trash is collected?) you can just leave your trash in the (tied) bin liners by the curb so you won\u2019t have an empty receptacle by the curb for pet owners to dispose waste in.\n\nI guess my judgement is ESH\u2026 the pet owner for putting the waste in your empty, unlined, privately owned can, and you for throwing the waste into the street.", "ESH, I could even see YTA because OP only made the problem worse. \n\nHowever, all of the YTA posts saying that of course people should allow others to place their poop bags in their private trash cans are incredibly disappointing. Yes, trash goes in a trash can, we all know that, but it's HIS trash can for HIS trash, not a place to store poop bags for a week.\n\nOP is a major AH for how he handled this situation. There is no reason to be chucking poop bags into a street to get run over by a car and spread out for a long distance. That's bad and childish.\n\nPlacing your poop into someone else's bin, however, is also major AH behavior. As someone with two German Shepherds (therefore, massive poops), I want to stress that the poop bags are most definitely pretty permeable and do not contain the smell.\n\nDog owners, hold your poop until you find an actual public trash can or get home. I've had to carry big ol bags of poop for miles on walks and, trust me, it isn't that hard.\n\nAlso this forum is funny because like a month ago it had a completely different reaction to placing poop in someone else\u2019s bin. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10eda79/aita_for_putting_a_bag_of_dog_poop_in_a_strangers/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf", "YTA.

Put a sign on your bin.", "Hmm,\n\nI'd say ESH,\n\nIt's not cool to for a stranger to use your bin for their dog poo bags, but it does beat throwing it on the floor.  \nTwo wrongs don't make a right, I understand you don't want other people to use your freshly emptied bin.

Very recently I opened my general waste bin and saw a bag of someone else\u2019s dog\u2019s poop. Bear in mind, there\u2019s literally a designated dog waste bin meters away from my house.

It\u2019s a non issue but the moment you put it in the middle of the street, you make it an issue. You are littering in YOUR OWN neighborhood.

Rather than throwing excrement in the street  can't you just set up a camera to find the culprit and start throwing it back at their house?", "YTA- trash cans aren't private once they hit the curb. That's why police are allowed to search them without a warrant. If your can is out, technically it's free use.", "YTA. \n\nThe person who threw the poop in your trash was annoying (which is why I don't throw poop bags in private trash cans even though there's only one public trash on my 5 mile route) but I can't imagine being so anal about my *literal trash can* that I a) look into it at all  and b) subsequently reach into it and pull out a baggy of poop to throw it into the road. \n\nAlso your logic about \"if my trash can wasn't here they would have tossed it in the street anyway\" is asinine. They would *not* have done so. They would have held onto it until they found a different trash can. Trust me. If they were gonna leave poop on the street, they would have just left poop on the street. \n\nPut a sign on it I guess. Seems like a weird hill to die on. Does it cost you additional money for one solitary baggy of poop?", "If your trash can came from your trash company, you\u2019re renting the trash can, you don\u2019t own it first of all. Becoming a first time home owner I had no idea that you rent the trash can and recycle bin from the trash company. \n\nSecond, I would much rather someone throw their dog poop in my trash can than on the ground in my neighborhood.

Put a sign on your garbage asking people not to throw dog poop into the bins - that's really all you do.

Of course it's not your \"responsibility\", but why in the world would you make the situation worse? That's not punishing the bag tosser, it's punishing people who use and/or clean up the road.", "YTA they put poop in your bin but you\u2019re the one who put it on the street. At least they tried.

While I will lug that bag around for miles if I have to, I know 1 in a million people will be an asshole if I drop the bag in a private trash can on the street.  It'd be cool if people weren't so protective of their outdoor trash can for such a small deposit.", "YTA - I don\u2019t understand your issue with people putting garbage in your garbage bin.", "YTA, you are in fact littering.

So if you live in an area where the local government owns the trash cans (they usually have their name on them) the person was placing their pet waste in a public trash container. \n\n Not to mention, if you are in the U.S. when you place your trash out on the street for pick up, it's no longer on your property (which is why police can search it). \n\nNow on to why YTA. You're not punishing the person using your trash, you're punishing ALL of your neighbors and random government employees. Imagine running over the bags you chucked into the street, and they burst? Your driveway, garage, and tires might be covered in dog feces. Not to mention, it could make the interior of the car smell. \n\nNot only that, you're making someone clean up after you just because you don't want people using \"your\" trash cans.

They properly disposed the dog poop. Dog poop not being picked up is one of my biggest pet peeves because it\u2019s an eco-hazard same as putting plastic on the street. \n\nYou went out your way to dig shit out the trash bin when you could\u2019ve just left it alone until next weeks garbage pick up. Unless you use the trash bin to take baths, live in or whatever then you should not care that a stranger picked up dog shit and placed it in the bin. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want people using the trash bin then put it inside your house or get a gate.", "NTA for getting annoyed at the selfish pr*ck using your bin to dispose of summat they could easily throw in their bin.\n\nHowever YTA for throwing it where some poor sod could walk/drive over it.\n\n\nSometimes I struggle to decide whether it is dogs I dislike or their entitled owners.\nThink the dislike merges into one, further fuelled by threads like this, full of said owners, who see nothing wrong with throwing sh*t into someone else's bin.", "There are already a ton of comments similar to this, but I want to point out that a curb-side trash container is not a suitable receptacle for \u201cdoggie bags\u201d. Those bags are meant to temporarily hold the waste until you get home (or to an actual public trash can) and then be put in with other trash in an actual trash bag. The smaller bags are permeable and smell within a few hours or less. \n\nI use the same types of bags to scoop my cat litter everyday, and I have a sealed can, with a black contractor trash bag, in my basement where Inout them until I take the bigger bag and put in my big green can. I don\u2019t even put the small bags in my main kitchen trash (which I empty every other day) because it stinks. \n\nMy big green trash cans (that I bought) for the garbage men is (usually) quite clean.

When the bag came out, I used a shovel to chuck the bag into the middle of the road.\n\nMy reasoning is that whoever put the bag of poop into our empty private trash container without our permission didn\u2019t put it into a valid public trash container, so I assisted the bag to get to its final destination (the public street) as if my trash container didn\u2019t exist; I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s my responsibility to properly dispose of someone else\u2019s pet poop.\n\nMy wife told me that I am littering, but I countered by saying that the poop bag thrower is the litterer because they didn\u2019t dispose of their waste in a proper receptacle and instead trespassed by disposing it in our private, freshly emptied trash containers, which were on the public street for disposal day. I plan to try to find out who is the poop bag thrower in the near future and ask them to not throw their waste in our trash container, but will continue to chuck their improperly disposed poop bag into the street in the meantime.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

In the first or second summer of COVID, I met with a few people to have pizza in my back yard. Couldn\u2019t get away from the hot trash stink, even outside in a large yard with the bin lids on.", "Genius idea, I don't know why I didn't think of that? /s\nHence, the small bin designated for dog poop in the backyard.\n\nMaybe that's because where I live, you can't store /leave the big trashcans outside, the same goes for some other neighborhoods too. Personally, I have stairs to my backyard, and I ain't dragging the big trash bin up and down the stairs.", "What?

I have stopped putting my bagged dog poop in any neighbor's trash cans because a few have asked me to stop and I figure it's better to just stop entirely since I don't want to die on this hill. But I think it's bizarre, a symptom of a society that values private property over  everything else, and I'm going to judge people who care so much about it.", "That\u2019s a new one", "FYI, my parents got a cheap plastic cooler to leave their two dogs' poop bags before they go to the trash.  Since it's meant to seal tighter than a garbage can you have to get close to be able to smell it even when it's hot out.", "Look I don't care man", "I have cats.  I can attest to the odor because I scoop the litter boxes daily and put the bags in the outside trash can in the garage.", "The amount doesn't matter.

I only mentioned that part because someone from the UK specifically said they OWN their own bins in their part of the country and they don't have huge ones provided by some service, but just take their own regular can out. Even taking that point completely out, there are definitely a hell of a lot of HOAs that absolutely DO require you take it out of sight, which most often requires you to take it inside.", "I get I guess I\u2019m in the minority but I literally cannot Imagine a world that I care about my outdoor trash can.", "Sorry to hear!

(I have cats not dogs, but I scoop two litterboxes daily).", "I've noticed lately with my trash if the bag is smaller than a 13  gallon kitchen trash bag there is a tendency for the collectors to just leave it in the can.  So if I use a walmart bag to collect cat poo from the little box, tie it up and toss it in, it may take 3 or 4 weeks before it's gone.  Truthfully I can understand OP not wanting it to stay in there for a month till it's decomposing and maggots have taken over the can from feasting on it.", "Too many dogs owners like this", "And you are the authority on the \"Right thing to do\"?

I don\u2019t know about everyone else but I live in a warm climate and my trash collection frequently runs behind. I don\u2019t want that smell lingering in my bin. I acknowledge that it\u2019s a lot less bad than throwing the poop in the bin that\u2019s already been emptied; sure, it\u2019s not even on the same level, but I still don\u2019t like it.", "Honestly just put a sign on your trash bin that says \"no putting dog poop in my bin\" or something like that.

The garbage man picks up the trash can (or grabs the bag off the ground if allowed in the area) and empties it by hand into the back of the truck. Most people buy their own bins and they come in all shapes and sizes.\n\n>What do you do with your own dog's crap? What about nappies or sanitary towels, are they in the kitchen all week too?\n\nThat depends on the individual, many people have a second bin they buy for outdoors and put both out, many people may simply put the dog poo in a bag in the bin on garbage day. Many people have a small waste basket they keep in the bathroom (or garage if lucky enough for that) for hygiene products that then get put into the larger bin and brought out on garbage day.", "You're arguing that one person throws one small piece of trash into someone else's bin is not wrong, then that argument should hold true if 500 people or 1000 people does it too.

It's just logical reasoning.", "Nothing about your own original comment or OP's post has suggested this is the case. I'm not sure what a hypothetical situation has to do with the actual post. If you or OP want to clarify that your bins have to be brought inside, then I would agree that a bag of poop thrown in it is annoying. I stand by my opinion that a bag of poop that's in an outside trash can is not a big deal.

There is no fee (other than regular taxes, or a replacement fee if your can breaks).\n\nYou can buy extra bags for $5 per bag if you run out of room, but the hell with that. If I have extra bags I'm keeping them in my garage and putting them in my neighbors bins on the nights before collection when they put their bins out.\n\nI also drop poop bags in cans on these same nights when I walk my dogs, although I would personally never put poop bags or trash in a bin after it is emptied. \n\nBut reading through this thread, some people are weird about their trash.", ">I\u2019d rather fish a bag out of the trash than have to pick up dog poop.\n\nSure, but you wouldnt have to do either if the dog owner wernt an AH throwing poop they should be bringing home to their bin in yours.", "I have no issues taking my neighbors trash if theirs is full.

You're not even allowed to throw dog poop in public trash at the park, you'll be fined.
