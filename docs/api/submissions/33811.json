How boring !!\n\nOf course, you need to be happy and if surgery is what you really want, then go for it.", "Oh, I have some experience with this.\n\nAbout six months ago my girlfriend decided to get lipo to deal with persistent love handles she wasn\u2019t able to eliminate via targeted diet or exercise. It was to the point that even doing CrossFit and working with a personal trainer/nutritionist she was able to achieve the body she wanted with this one exception.\n\nWhen she told me I didn\u2019t react very well, our financial position is considerably worse than yours, but it was all her money so that was her concern not mine. My major concerns were as follows:\n\n1. I did not want her to risk her physical health such as with the global anesthesia and other risks that any unconscious surgery (even minor cosmetic ones) invariably pose.\n\n2. I did not want her to get trapped in a cycle of hyper fixating on her self-perceived bodily flaws to the point that she would develop an addiction or dependency on plastic surgery.\n\n3. I always personally loved her body just as it was. I didn\u2019t want her to change because after so many years I\u2019ve truly learned every inch of her body and come to love every inch too.\n\nFor 1., I was alleviated by ample research and a discussion with the doctor who walked me through the risks of the procedure as well as introduced me to his wife who had already undergone multiple similar procedures. Safety concerns are still valid but I was made to understand the risks are statistically very low and that I would be able to be there through it all.\n\nFor 2., we talked about it between us and she admitted that it wouldn\u2019t be a fix-all solution to her body issues and that this in particular was something she had focused on for a long time. I understand having certain things you really hate about yourself can be detrimental in the long term. But there is something to be said about self acceptance as well and we both agreed a balance needs to be struck between the two. This was helped along by the fact she\u2019d already done a lot before the surgery to try to deal with the issue. It was made clear that this wasn\u2019t something she was doing on a whim, but that she had thought it through reasonably and thoroughly.\n\nAnd for #3, she made it clear she was doing it for herself and that she was totally confident in my level of attraction toward her. Even though it made me sad that she felt she needed to change so badly, ultimately I chose to value her comfort and self-confidence, knowing that she will always be at her sexiest to me when she is happy and comfortable in her own skin. \n\nEven with all of that said, the experience was still really mortifying for me. Obviously for her even more so, but I\u2019m focusing on my perspective because that\u2019s what I think you\u2019re looking for here. \n\nI\u2019ll never forget the sheer rush of relief I felt when she came out from the anesthetic and looked at me, calling my name with a smile on her face. There was a point in her recovery when her stitches came undone while she was napping and she wound up bleeding through a comforter, two bed sheets and halfway through a mattress pad as well as her gauze and all that. When I saw the blood, well, it was truly the most soul crushing, lung-emptying moment of my entire life. So safe to say I overreacted a little lol but her doctor met us right away at his office and redid her stitches. It wound up totally fine.\n\nI guess I\u2019m rambling now but my point really comes down to the fact that I think your husband is just concerned for your physical well-being and your own self-perception. And that if you two work together to come up with a plan unique to your situation, you should be able to meet in the middle and go about this with mutual love and comfort.

But this is a marriage. It\u2019s not only her choice anymore. Her husbands opinion should be taken into consideration.

And I'm not, I'm actually caring, listen to my wife, take her feelings into consideration, share housework, show love etc. All of this because she reciprocates. If she decided that she was going to do whatever she wanted and ignored my feelings, then she would be setting the standard at which the relationship operates. I compromise because she compromises, and she compromises because I do. It a trusting and loving relationship built over years, and for her to turn it on it's head would frankly be quite shocking. I suspect in your world, you are number one, and compromise means losing for you.", "I have experienced it, one of my thumbs looks like a boomerang and they're both covered in scars from surgeries at birth. I was bullied for their appearance ALOT in highschool. I got through it by realizing there's nothing wrong with how I look, there's something wrong with them for being cruel.", "Hi, dont wanna talk you out of breast reduction, I'm a mid-big cup size girl too and I get the thing you're saying about it being hard to find outfits. I've often cried in changing stalls cause just nothing would fit well and find it hard to find good bras that dont hurt. Just wanted to share an instagram account I discovered recently that has helped me understand that it's basically the fashion industry not properly accomodating big cup/small band ppl. It gives tips and reviews on mainly bras, maybe you can get sth out of it too: https://www.instagram.com/itsjenwarnes?igsh=dWFnbnE5dmE5bGFh again, dont wanna talk you out of it, I've been thinking about it a lot too and I think small cup fashion can just look so rad haha. Just some friendly advice that there are comfortable bras out there for every cup size, just usually not in the regular fashion stores", "This would be something I would support, as it would increase your quality of life and isn't cosmetic. Of course, this could be countered with who am I to say someone getting a purely cosmetic surgery isn't increasing their quality of life? Honestly, I don't know.

Lol", "Getting surgery because of an accident is completely different than doing it because of insecurity.", "[deleted]", "But should she stay with a man who is selfish and controlling?", "I\u2019m sure OP has considered all the risks, it would be silly not to. Thats also with _any_ procedure _anywhere_ - nothing is always 100% safe and guaranteed, complications can arise at any moment and there are _always_ risks going under the knife.", "What happens if the home country (US?) surgeons don\u2019t do a good job?", "I\u2019m going to reiterate - I\u2019m pretty sure OP knows this? For someone who has been insecure about their nose for over 15 years, I highly doubt she hasn\u2019t researched this extensively multiple times ..", "And how do you know that? Most people who get plastic surgery do it to change a part of their body that they've NEVER been happy with. And the majority of people are happier and more confident with their looks afterward. My partner researched for over a year before she made the call to get surgery because she wanted to be sure it's what she wanted, which is what most people in OP's position tend to do. It's a lot of money to throw at a maybe. Seems like OP has done her research and is sure she wants it and it will make her happy. So who are you to say it won't help her? Only she knows that and only she can make this decision for herself.", "So according to you, she can go have sex with someone else, since he doesn't control what she does right?\n\nA relationship operates within boundaries.\nSome boundaries are implicit, others explicit.\n\nI would argue that most people would have major issue with their partner changing their face without asking for permission.\n\nIf she wants to be single she can do whatever she wants. If she wants to keep being married she should involve her husband in the decision.", "With the same reasoning she could therefore, according to you, cheat on her husband, since its her body right?\n\nWrong. There are boundaries in a relationship within which the relationship operates, and nobody will be okay with the partner changing their face without being asked.\n\nInitial attraction (and thus love) is a chemical process in the brain, completely reliant on looks. Only looks can make someone fall in love and be attracted. You're attracted to the face. That's what attraction means.\n\nChanging the face means you're no longer the same person looks wise. So if she doesn't  want the marriage to be over instantly over this massive breach of trust, she will have to get her husbands consent.\n\nObviously if she intends to be single she can do whatever she wants. That however is not what we are talking about here.", "Yup, that's how it goes. Then regular health care is good enough to \"fix\" it.", "No worries! And I don\u2019t take offense at all. Mostly for me it\u2019s the rubbing of the bras, the back pain and general physical discomfort that\u2019s the issue. And unfortunately not wearing a bra causes back pain. So it\u2019s a catch 22. \n\nAs I\u2019ve gotten older I have definitely become more comfortable fashion wise with them. Since I\u2019m a DDD getting into F depending on the bra. And I also wouldn\u2019t recommend people just getting reductions and really researching before hand.", "That\u2019s why I suggest couples counseling. It\u2019s a neutral environment where you both can discuss and figure out the why. \nIve had friends who got nose jobs. Some for good reason. And others for bad reasons. The girls who did it for good reasons (even if it was purely cosmetic) are much happier with the results and feel affirmed.", "Sure. But the person I was responding to wasn\u2019t differentiating. \n\nWhat I was trying to get at is people\u2019s faces and features change over the years for a multitude of reasons. Some are slow progression, others are fast. Some are wanted, some aren\u2019t. \n\nAnd if marriage hinged on \u201cyou need to look the same\u201d then no one should be married to anyone because you can\u2019t guarantee anything will stay the same. \n\nAnd there are reasons cosmetic surgeries are done. And for a lot of people who have a long term want that is being done because of their reasons (ie not being influenced by partners or family or friends), then they can sometimes be necessary, gender affirming and helpful to making you feel at home in your own body. \n\nNow would it be nice if everyone could be at peace in their own bodies. Sure. But not everyone has that luxury. And people from all walks of life and gender expressions could want cosmetic procedures to help alleviate that feeling. Which is why it shouldn\u2019t be done lightly. And Op isn\u2019t taking this lightly. She\u2019s been looking into it for years and researching it and being open and creating dialogue about it.", "That's for him to decide, not you.", "They certainly can, and when complications do arise it\u2019s a lot easier to deal with them when you\u2019re in your home country, especially if that\u2019s a western democracy with strong consumer rights laws and a (mostly) trustworthy and reliable justice system.", "Depends on the rules and regulations in your home country.  What rights do you have when you complain?  From what I\u2019ve heard of the US I imagine it might involve suing.  Follow up medical care may well also be involved.\n\nThat\u2019s not really the point though.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t really matter specifically what you would do in that eventuality, because *pretty much anything* you might do is going to be a *lot* harder when it happens thousands of miles from where you live, in a place where you\u2019re not a citizen.", "If she knows everything than she doesn\u2019t need to post.

You can't compare committing adultery to having cosmetic surgery", ">A relationship operates within boundaries.\nSome boundaries are implicit, others explicit.\n\nBoundaries are for yourself, not for others. \n\n>So according to you, she can go have sex with someone else, since he doesn't control what she does right?\n\nNo, he actually can't control it but he can have a boundary for that which means if she cheats that he can say it's unforgivable for him and that he will end the relationship. \n\nThat means he can communicate what boundaries he has in a relationship and if she doesn't agree or goes against it after agreeing he can leave.", "So many things wrong with this comment I don\u2019t know where to start.", "She could, in fact, cheat on her husband if she wants to. She does not need his consent or permission to do so. Her husband, then, would operate based on HIS boundaries and leave the relationship. I hope that cleared up what boundaries means for you!!", "Bro, get counselling. This is not a healthy concept of what relationships should be. This will make you unhappy in the longterm.", "I know what you mean about the rubbing of the fabric. In my case it came from a too small cup size (for years I mistakenly thought I was a smaller size than I am) and/or a yeast infection caused by boob sweat that I had for a looong time without realising. It's very uncomfortable to wear a bra with that. Maybe one or both of those could apply to you? I'm 33 btw and only about 2 years ago discovered that I was wearing the wrong size, apparently very common occurance.\n\nThe back pain absolutely sucks, no arguing there.", "Sister F/G here and now a D-DD with very similar problems as you.\nMy reduction and lift was the best thing I've ever done for myself. Now I can fit in clothes better and also fixed some neck and back issues I had that turned out to be because of the weight. And it is amazing not to have to wear a bra! \n\nI'd do a lot of research and I advise to steer away from surgeons who want to put an implant so your breast looks fuller. I consulted with 3 locally and one in LA. \nA friend of mine got talked into putting an implant for her redux/lift and she ended up just having a myriad of health issues cause of that, not to mention now she has to get those implants replaced at some point.", "Not necessarily if it\u2019s 70% cheaper.", "Not sure I understand. She knows the info about the procedure, the post is about the morality of doing it when it would make her husband sad.", "She\u2019s not asking about our opinion on the safety or after care of the procedure. She likely has that already sorted out, or else she would definitely mention if she expects her partner to take care of her in a foreign country. \n\n Shes asking our opinion on whether she will be TA if she goes ahead with the procedure despite her husband being against it.", "What she hasn\u2019t made clear in the post is the exact reason WHY she needs it. It\u2019s a relationship and the husband is obviously in love with her the way she is. If she goes through with it the trust is gone. Psychologically coming from a male, this is just as damaging as cheating. You love her a certain way and she then concocts a plan to lie, go out of the country to Turkey to get a nose job?  There is so much wrong here on every level.", "But does that make it the right thing to do?", "That\u2019s so good to hear. And I would never want any implants. I would rather have a saggier boob that just needs some shape wear then add in anything non organic that needs to live in my body. (I\u2019m cool eating non organic food but plastic in my chest is a no go for me). Also the solution that means less surgeries is my preference. I\u2019ve already had two abdominal surgeries as a child to correct a few health issues. I don\u2019t need more than what\u2019s necessary. And as I\u2019ve gotten older and experienced the side effects of having larger breasts. The more I think it\u2019s necessary.", "The after care is a part of consulting with her husband.  Per her question.", "Totally with you on that one, I had a friend who had implants \ncause she was talked into them by a shitty surgeon, she felt sick all the time after the surgery, she always felt like she had a cold. It ended up being the implants causing a small recurring staph infection, the surgeon refused to agree it was the implants, and told her it had to be something else, she was so sure she ended up going somewhere else to get them removed. After getting them out she never had any health problems.", "Did you even read the post? Her question is very simple - WIBTA if I get the procedure without husband\u2019s \u201cconsent\u201d.\n\n**You** are assuming husband will be liable for after care - what if she\u2019s planning to stay with her mom afterwards? Or a friend? A sibling? Husband could have no hand in aftercare ..", "And I answered.  NTA, doesn\u2019t need her husbands consent.  However should discuss several things with him.  It\u2019s typical to offer advice if you have experience.  Ad someone who took care of someone with a nose job it\u2019s a chore.  Why so defensive about my answer?  You post stats tell me you are likely a troll bot."]}
