I\u2019m not talking about baby weight. I mean that I was 200 lbs at 5\u20191\u2019\u2019 when I was 16. For as long as I could remember, I felt uncomfortable in my own body. When I went to college, I decided it was time to change. It took years of grueling work/education, but I\u2019m finally at a healthy weight. I\u2019m terrified of going back.\n\n\nThe only problem is that my mom (55F) has tons of family photos around the house. Every time I go home, I\u2019m reminded of the most emotionally difficult time of my life. I begged my mom to at least take down the photos that only have me in them, but she refused.\n\n\nI decided to take matters into my own hands. Every time I came to visit, I gradually put stickers over my face in family pictures. She didn\u2019t notice, so I decided to take it up a notch.\n\n\nI scanned the original pictures with my phone. I paid one of my friends to photoshop them afterward. They were pretty obvious, but I was hoping nobody would notice at a glance. After the swap, I took the originals to my apartment. I got away with this two times, but I got caught in the act with the third.\n\n\nMy mom and I got into a huge argument about it. She said that I had no right to take those photos, or \u201cvandalize\u201d  the others, because it wasn\u2019t my house. I pointed out that I only took my photos and only put removable stickers on the others. She was still furious. I\u2019m banned from the house until I give the originals back.\n\n\nThe rest of my family has been pressuring me to give in, because Thanksgiving is coming up. I refuse to do so, because I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong here. \n\n\nAITA?\n\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t know if this additional information changes anything, but I\u2019ll add it just in case. I have a suspicion that my mom wouldn\u2019t remove those photos for a deeper reason. She is obese, and I think she might be resentful of my weight loss.", "created_utc": 1667430692, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ykl5mt/aita_for_removing_my_preweight_loss_pictures_from/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Those aren\u2019t your photos. Plus, it doesn\u2019t matter if you like it or not but people loved you and knew you when you were fat. Taking the pictures away doesn\u2019t change the past.

Ive had a few cycles of weight loss but I\u2019m now in my mid-30s and been stable with a  120lbs loss for around 5 years. I look completely different now than I did years ago, but that doesn\u2019t erase my past. I was at my highest weight when I got married, but I haven\u2019t forced everyone to burn my wedding pictures. When someone new sees those pics I just say \u201cYeah, I struggled with my weight but I\u2019m in a different place now\u201d. I don\u2019t love photos of me at my fattest because I know I was struggling mightily with BED and depression, but the people who knew and loved me still loved that version of me. Unless you can MIB style mind wipe the memory of your bigger self from the minds of everyone who has ever met you, the memory of You Version 1.0 is going to still exist. Taking your family photos only served to rob your family of precious memories. \n\nYou need to do some therapy or at least deep introspection about why those photos bother you so much. Your obsession is unhealthy. You don\u2019t have to love those photos but you should understand that the bigger body was a reality and that reality doesn\u2019t make you a worse person or undeserving of love and affection or whatever twisted shit you told yourself. The weight was like a scab or a bad haircut. It was a part of your physical presence for a time and therefore part of your history.

If you don\u2019t want to look at the original photos. Stay out of her home.", "Maybe you should learn to see them not as something to be ashamed of but as a reminder of how far you have come. Your mum love the girl in this photo no matter her weight, because you are her baby, and she is clearly proud of you and that is why she want to display those photos. Maybe you should learn to love this girl in the photo too and be proud of how far you have come. Her eating so much was a symptom of something deaper, and you will have to learn to forgive her...

I suggest working with a therapist to help seeing those photos be less traumatizing for you\u2026 maybe a session or two with mom, so she could understand that it hurts you and maybe be flexible about taking them down while you are over.

If she won\u2019t do that, I have to wonder why she isn\u2019t more respectful of the trauma you went through with your weight. Buy her a nice photo album and ask her to put the photos of you in them to keep them safe and to look at whenever she wants.

When I went to college, I decided it was time to change. It took years of grueling work/education, but I\u2019m finally at a healthy weight. I\u2019m terrified of going back.\n\n\nThe only problem is that my mom (55F) has tons of family photos around the house.

I begged my mom to at least take down the photos that only have me in them, but she refused.\n\n\nI decided to take matters into my own hands. Every time I came to visit, I gradually put stickers over my face in family pictures. She didn\u2019t notice, so I decided to take it up a notch.\n\n\nI scanned the original pictures with my phone. I paid one of my friends to photoshop them afterward. They were pretty obvious, but I was hoping nobody would notice at a glance. After the swap, I took the originals to my apartment. I got away with this two times, but I got caught in the act with the third.\n\n\nMy mom and I got into a huge argument about it. She said that I had no right to take those photos, or \u201cvandalize\u201d  the others, because it wasn\u2019t my house. I pointed out that I only took my photos and only put removable stickers on the others. She was still furious. I\u2019m banned from the house until I give the originals back.\n\n\nThe rest of my family has been pressuring me to give in, because Thanksgiving is coming up. I refuse to do so, because I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong here. \n\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It started for me at 16, and a decade later, I still find myself slipping into it if I\u2019m not careful. The way you talk about your past self and your current weight sound all the alarms for me when it comes to ED. Unfortunately, with eating disorders, when people develop them as a larger person, it\u2019s often celebrated and ignored. Your mom sees every stage of your life as it is, which is beautiful. It\u2019s taken me years to realize my health isn\u2019t tied to my weight, but its ability to allow me to enjoy the hobbies I love, including food. While you are healthy now, your mindset and fat phobia will bleed into all aspects of your life. I don\u2019t think your 16-year-old self deserves the hate for her body that you are giving her. She was still you, and she still deserves love. It would be helpful for you to do at least a couple of therapy sessions to help you create a healthy mindset regarding weight and food.

Those are not your pictures. They are her property and they have you in them. If I were your mother I would just call the cops and have you give them back that way.

Then book an appointment and work through these problems that make you think it is ok to steal.", "NTA but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re in the right. You had a deeply emotional and personally upsetting response to seeing those older photos of yourself. You politely asked your mother to remove them, she refused. Your feelings there are justified, but your actions are out of order. Where you should have drawn the line would be to stop going over to her house. Where she should have at least compromised with you would be to swap them out at least for holidays/when extended family is over (or when you come over; or have new family portraits taken and move older photos to another part of the house, etc. etc.). \nSeems like both you and your mom need some personal growth work here.", "NTA - As a photographer I have always believed that a person has the rights to photos that they are a subject in.

This is a power trip.", "first of all, YTA. \n& by family pictures do you mean ones that your mother made appointments for & paid money to have them done professionally? not that it really matters for the verdict but it does add to your wrongdoings. \ni find myself wanting to sympathize with you because i had a pretty severe eating disorder in high school & my first few years of college that caused me to lose 40-50 pounds in a few months. looking back at those pictures aren't necessarily fun, but i'm not that person anymore. i'm glad you put in the work to make yourself physically healthier but you need to seek therapy for your mental health if these are actions you feel you need to take.", "Just replace the two you took with pics of the new you. \nYour family should understand why that's important to you and cut you some slack. \nLeave all the family ones alone but ask if a new family one for this year can be taken and added to that wall. \nThat should be a compromise everyone could agree to.", "I don\u2019t feel comfortable giving you a judgement for what you\u2019re doing because I\u2019ve been there myself and I understand. When I lost 100lbs in college, I didn\u2019t want to see photos of myself ANYWHERE- at my parents,\u2019 grandparents,\u2019 photo albums, etc. It stirred up negative emotions for me and made me hate myself even more for having been fat. It took me years to me to accept that my family and friends didn\u2019t feel what I felt when I saw those photos. As corny as it sounds, I\u2019m pretty sure when your mom sees you in those photos, she doesn\u2019t see what you see and what you think everyone else sees.\n\nPLEASE, seek counseling.

It's not like you're asking for all photos of you to be removed, just the ones where it's only you. Can your mother not compromise and put them somewhere that's not completely out in the open? I don't agree with taking them without permission, but I do understand why you felt pushed to this point. I quite literally have taken away every trace of myself from ages 10-16 off the internet.
