I\u2019m not talking about baby weight. I mean that I was 200 lbs at 5\u20191\u2019\u2019 when I was 16. For as long as I could remember, I felt uncomfortable in my own body. When I went to college, I decided it was time to change. It took years of grueling work/education, but I\u2019m finally at a healthy weight. I\u2019m terrified of going back.\n\n\nThe only problem is that my mom (55F) has tons of family photos around the house. Every time I go home, I\u2019m reminded of the most emotionally difficult time of my life. I begged my mom to at least take down the photos that only have me in them, but she refused.\n\n\nI decided to take matters into my own hands. Every time I came to visit, I gradually put stickers over my face in family pictures. She didn\u2019t notice, so I decided to take it up a notch.\n\n\nI scanned the original pictures with my phone. I paid one of my friends to photoshop them afterward. They were pretty obvious, but I was hoping nobody would notice at a glance. After the swap, I took the originals to my apartment. I got away with this two times, but I got caught in the act with the third.\n\n\nMy mom and I got into a huge argument about it. She said that I had no right to take those photos, or \u201cvandalize\u201d  the others, because it wasn\u2019t my house. I pointed out that I only took my photos and only put removable stickers on the others. She was still furious. I\u2019m banned from the house until I give the originals back.\n\n\nThe rest of my family has been pressuring me to give in, because Thanksgiving is coming up. I refuse to do so, because I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong here. \n\n\nAITA?\n\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t know if this additional information changes anything, but I\u2019ll add it just in case. I have a suspicion that my mom wouldn\u2019t remove those photos for a deeper reason. She is obese, and I think she might be resentful of my weight loss.\n\n\nEdit: Here\u2019s some more information. I\u2019m not ashamed of my past self, and I don\u2019t hate my past self. I don\u2019t like those pictures because they remind me of the constant, physical pain I was in at that weight. When I see them, it feels like reliving it all over again.\n\n\nEdit: Here\u2019s why I think my mom is resentful of my weight loss. \n\n\nShe has made weird comments about my weight loss. Every since I lost the weight, she calls me vain a lot.\n\nOne time, we were sitting for dinner with my aunt. My aunt and I were discussing my weight loss, and my mom suddenly chimed in, \u201cOk, I think that enough time spent stroking your ego\u201d.\n\nAnother time, she insisted on giving me a coat that was 3 times too big. When I said no, she asked if I thought I was too good for it.", "created_utc": 1667430692, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ykl5mt/aita_for_removing_my_preweight_loss_pictures_from/", "score": 701, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Have you seen a therapist?", "YTA. \n\nThey aren't your photos. You've worked hard on your weight. Now you need to work on your mental health.

You don't deserve to live like that.", "YTA \n\nShe\u2019s right, it\u2019s her house and those are her belongings.", "YTA.  You\u2019re taking away the pictures she keeps as memories of her family.  You need to work on accepting that your past is your past, and you can\u2019t (and shouldn\u2019t!) erase it.

Good for you that you succeeded in remaking your body to suit yourself.    But, the pictures belong to Mom.   She overreacted.   You should return the pictures.

Just because you're uncomfortable with them, doesn't mean you get to steal things from other people's homes. I would suggest you get back into therapy if you aren't in it already to work through this. It's not healthy.", "YTA. Congratulations on an incredible accomplishment; now stop undermining it by acting silly. You don\u2019t own the rest of the world\u2019s memory. You can\u2019t go back in time and edit your own past image.

This is a you problem and you're the one who needs to work it out. You've done a great job at transforming your body. Now, it's time to work on your mental health. You can never erase who you were before your weight loss but you can embrace the idea that you pushed yourself and achieved something many people who struggle with weight aren't able to. \n\nGood luck!", "YTA. Those aren\u2019t your photos. Plus, it doesn\u2019t matter if you like it or not but people loved you and knew you when you were fat. Taking the pictures away doesn\u2019t change the past. I\u2019m sure your mother loved you at your higher weight and cherished those memories. \n\nI get it OP. Ive had a few cycles of weight loss but I\u2019m now in my mid-30s and been stable with a  120lbs loss for around 5 years. I look completely different now than I did years ago, but that doesn\u2019t erase my past. I was at my highest weight when I got married, but I haven\u2019t forced everyone to burn my wedding pictures. When someone new sees those pics I just say \u201cYeah, I struggled with my weight but I\u2019m in a different place now\u201d. I don\u2019t love photos of me at my fattest because I know I was struggling mightily with BED and depression, but the people who knew and loved me still loved that version of me. Unless you can MIB style mind wipe the memory of your bigger self from the minds of everyone who has ever met you, the memory of You Version 1.0 is going to still exist. Taking your family photos only served to rob your family of precious memories. \n\nYou need to do some therapy or at least deep introspection about why those photos bother you so much. Your obsession is unhealthy. You don\u2019t have to love those photos but you should understand that the bigger body was a reality and that reality doesn\u2019t make you a worse person or undeserving of love and affection or whatever twisted shit you told yourself. The weight was like a scab or a bad haircut. It was a part of your physical presence for a time and therefore part of your history. It doesn\u2019t have to define you, but you also can\u2019t choose how other people (fondly) remember you in that season.", "YTA. You are absolutely, obviously, entirely deadass wrong. Get therapy. Get help.", "YTA, you literally stole something from a home you don't live in. Those may be pictures of you, but they DO NOT BELONG TO YOU.\n\nI understand that was a hard time in your life, but that doesn't mean you get to steal your MOTHER'S happy memories of those years just because it makes you uncomfortable.\n\nAdults manage their own traumas, not force others to accommodate them.", "YTA.  This is another reason why I feel filters on social media are toxic.  This kind of addiction is gross.  You really need to find a therapist.  This isn\u2019t healthy at all.", "YTA.

Please find some help with this.", "Are you going to go through your family and friends phones and delete all the photos? Or is it about a self reminder", "YTA\n\nYou can not steal from people even if those people are your parents. Your mom is entitled to her memories of your childhood.\n\nGive her stuff back. If you don\u2019t want to look at the original photos. Stay out of her home.", "Maybe you should learn to see them not as something to be ashamed of but as a reminder of how far you have come. Your mum love the girl in this photo no matter her weight, because you are her baby, and she is clearly proud of you and that is why she want to display those photos. Maybe you should learn to love this girl in the photo too and be proud of how far you have come. Her eating so much was a symptom of something deaper, and you will have to learn to forgive her... Forgive yourself... \n\nSo are you the AH? To your mum yes, but even more to yourself. You cannot erase your past but you can use it to grow. And this is from someone who had battle an eating disorder.\n\nHug", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s not your house, those pictures don\u2019t belong to you.  Your mom wants those memories and wants those pictures up in her home so she can see them.\n\nYou don\u2019t like seeing pictures of how you looked before?

Yeah those pics are bad memories of yours, but they are happy memories for your mother. They were not yours to remove or damage. It's not your house not your property you didn't have a right to take away those memories from your mom.", "YTA. We all have pictures we hate that our parents keep up. This is your mums house and those are her memories. You had no right to steal from her. Yes you asked her to do you a kindness and remove them but she is obviously attached to them and you betrayed her by doing what you did.", "YTA. One day she may not remember you as you are, but as you were and you\u2019ve taken the true memories away. Your issues with yourself shouldn\u2019t punish your mother or anyone else that loves you for you.", "I feel for you, but YTA- I have photos of my children growing up all over my house and I\u2019d be devastated to lose them. They\u2019re her memories, and presumably she was a loving mother to you who loves the kid in those photos. I suggest working with a therapist to help seeing those photos be less traumatizing for you\u2026 maybe a session or two with mom, so she could understand that it hurts you and maybe be flexible about taking them down while you are over. But ultimately it\u2019s her home and the way you\u2019ve written this, you don\u2019t live there, so you shouldn\u2019t be changing things in it. (You would be within your rights to come over less often though / not at all though, if you truly find pictures that upsetting). But again- you\u2019re better off working on yourself here, and not going nuclear over pictures.

You gotta understand though that's not your house and not your stuff. You can't just go putting stickers on her stuff or stealing it that's not cool so for your act of vandalism and theft yta.", "YTA those are her pictures and memories of you as you were and as she loved you regardless.

Just because you don\u2019t/didn\u2019t love yourself, doesn\u2019t mean your mom doesn\u2019t. Those are pictures of her baby. Those are her memories of her child. It sucks that you can\u2019t be kinder to the younger you, but she doesn\u2019t need to put away her happy memories to placate you.", "YTA \nAnd I say this as a current fat girl. \nThose pics are in the past.  It\u2019s not your house. Those aren\u2019t your property.  You literally stole from your mother.  \n\nI hate the pictures of me in my teens.  You can see the SH scars and bruises in some.  \nDo I steal them from my family\u2019s homes?  No. I don\u2019t. Because THEY ARE NOT MINE", "I understand your frustration OP but its not healthy to fixate on old photos like this.\n\nYTA give your mom her pictures back and stop damaging jer property.", "YTA. Your mom is right. It's her house. So if she doesn't want to change something, then she doesn't have to. You need to start acting like an adult instead of the immature brat that you are. Which means respecting how others keep their home rather than stealing something just because it makes you uncomfortable.", "YTA and a thief.", "YTA\n\nIt's not your house and you had not right to vandalize or steal her things.

I get that this is painful for you but Your mother is allowed to want memories as they were in her home. Stealing her originals is extremely shitty of you.", "YTA if parents only kept pics of their kids that were perfect they would lose 90% of their memories. There is no shame in struggling with your weight and there is even less in working towards being healthy but there is great shame in trying to reframe the past in an attempt to act as though your \"flaws\" never existed.

It\u2019s her house, her property, and her memories of *her own child.* If the pictures are triggering to you, then that\u2019s something you have to deal with yourself.

But you are being petty for trying to change your mother's house.", "I'd say halfway between NAH and ESH.\n\nI feel like the biggest issue is the communication between you and your mom- she doesn't seem to get that seeing those photos is actively harming your state of mind. In time, and with therapy, you may be able to look at the photos and not feel terrible but that time is not today. You can't simply get over it, or will yourself to achieve body neutrality like a lot of people in the comments seem to be suggesting. That requires years of mental reconditioning.\n\nYou are also jumping through a lot of hoops to edit and remove those photos, seemingly without first trying to reach other ways of compromise (your mom taking down the photos when you visit, as opposed to taking them done forever).\n\nAs for Thanksgiving and extended family pressuring you... I would return the photos because taking them was passive aggressive and overall not helpful to your 'side', but maybe warn them that you won't attend Thanksgiving dinner if they're going to be displayed. At this point in your life, they are hurting you (and while you should work on that independently). As a person who dealt with their trauma via exposure therapy- your not there yet.", "I\u2019m going with NTA on this one.  Sure, legally it\u2019s her house, but morally, she knows that those pics hurt you, and she\u2019d rather hurt you than to take them down.  I think, though, that you should just stop going over there and tell her you\u2019ve got no interest in seeing her until she\u2019s got no interest in hurting you.", "INFO: Did you remove pictures of just yourself or did you remove/badly photoshop entire family photos? This absolutely makes a difference. I\u2019m ambivalent about the first, but the second is a clear TA move.", "Tough one. NAH maybe? It's either ESH or NAH, your choice. And I only say that because I get not wanting to see images of yourself that give you dysphoria. But you also don't get to force your choice on someone else. I look at this like if you were trans. You'd be fully within your rights to insist that you aren't going to go over there or interact with mom unless she respects who you are, but you can't force them to do it by over riding their autonomy in their own home. By all means cut off contact, ignore them, whatever you need to protect yourself. But that only extends so far as your life and your choices.", "NTA. This one is iffy cause you kinda are but also not. Honestly me and you are the same. I\u2019m very very overweight I weigh like 220 and I just turned 17 so I fully understand what your going through since I\u2019m very self conscious and trying to lose weight. BUT I also understand your mom cause those are memories for her. Then again I understand that you want to forget that time period in your life so NTA. I think your mom should have respect your wishes and at least put them away but don\u2019t be ashamed, it may be a reminder of a difficult time, I get that, but it\u2019s also just shows how far you\u2019ve come.", "I\u2019m 55 and my mother still has my stupid high school graduation pictures up. Complete with 80s hair and makeup. If I could get away with what you did, I would! I applaud your hutzpah. I think asking her to take down the ones with just you but leaving the ones with groups including you is a fair compromise. If she won\u2019t do that, I have to wonder why she isn\u2019t more respectful of the trauma you went through with your weight. Buy her a nice photo album and ask her to put the photos of you in them to keep them safe and to look at whenever she wants. I\u2019m gonna go with ESH you for your admittedly clever scheme that nonetheless was destruction of property belonging to your mom and her for not respecting your desire to not be reminded of your trauma with your weight every time you visit", "Was your mom dead-weighting you?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m not talking about baby weight. I mean that I was 200 lbs at 5\u20191\u2019\u2019 when I was 16. For as long as I could remember, I felt uncomfortable in my own body. When I went to college, I decided it was time to change. It took years of grueling work/education, but I\u2019m finally at a healthy weight. I\u2019m terrified of going back.\n\n\nThe only problem is that my mom (55F) has tons of family photos around the house. Every time I go home, I\u2019m reminded of the most emotionally difficult time of my life. I begged my mom to at least take down the photos that only have me in them, but she refused.\n\n\nI decided to take matters into my own hands. Every time I came to visit, I gradually put stickers over my face in family pictures. She didn\u2019t notice, so I decided to take it up a notch.\n\n\nI scanned the original pictures with my phone. I paid one of my friends to photoshop them afterward. They were pretty obvious, but I was hoping nobody would notice at a glance. After the swap, I took the originals to my apartment. I got away with this two times, but I got caught in the act with the third.\n\n\nMy mom and I got into a huge argument about it. She said that I had no right to take those photos, or \u201cvandalize\u201d  the others, because it wasn\u2019t my house. I pointed out that I only took my photos and only put removable stickers on the others. She was still furious. I\u2019m banned from the house until I give the originals back.\n\n\nThe rest of my family has been pressuring me to give in, because Thanksgiving is coming up. I refuse to do so, because I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong here. \n\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s her house and her family photos. You shouldn\u2019t punish her by removing family photos of memories because you look different now. If you don\u2019t want the photos in your house, fine.

My mom has some horribly ugly and awkward pre teen photos of me hanging at her house. They\u2019re a bit embarrassing but o know that\u2019s not who I am or what I look like now.

It started for me at 16, and a decade later, I still find myself slipping into it if I\u2019m not careful. The way you talk about your past self and your current weight sound all the alarms for me when it comes to ED. Unfortunately, with eating disorders, when people develop them as a larger person, it\u2019s often celebrated and ignored. Your mom sees every stage of your life as it is, which is beautiful. It\u2019s taken me years to realize my health isn\u2019t tied to my weight, but its ability to allow me to enjoy the hobbies I love, including food. While you are healthy now, your mindset and fat phobia will bleed into all aspects of your life. I don\u2019t think your 16-year-old self deserves the hate for her body that you are giving her. She was still you, and she still deserves love. It would be helpful for you to do at least a couple of therapy sessions to help you create a healthy mindset regarding weight and food. Please remember that your past self's worth was never defined by her weight even if that\u2019s what society told you.", "YTA. You stole your mother\u2019s valuable mementos.

Those are not your pictures. They are her property and they have you in them. If I were your mother I would just call the cops and have you give them back that way.

Then book an appointment and work through these problems that make you think it is ok to steal.", "NTA but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re in the right. You had a deeply emotional and personally upsetting response to seeing those older photos of yourself. You politely asked your mother to remove them, she refused. Your feelings there are justified, but your actions are out of order. Where you should have drawn the line would be to stop going over to her house. Where she should have at least compromised with you would be to swap them out at least for holidays/when extended family is over (or when you come over; or have new family portraits taken and move older photos to another part of the house, etc. etc.). \nSeems like both you and your mom need some personal growth work here.", "NTA - As a photographer I have always believed that a person has the rights to photos that they are a subject in.

When I lost 100lbs in college, I didn\u2019t want to see photos of myself ANYWHERE- at my parents,\u2019 grandparents,\u2019 photo albums, etc. It stirred up negative emotions for me and made me hate myself even more for having been fat. It took me years to me to accept that my family and friends didn\u2019t feel what I felt when I saw those photos. As corny as it sounds, I\u2019m pretty sure when your mom sees you in those photos, she doesn\u2019t see what you see and what you think everyone else sees.\n\nPLEASE, seek counseling. You\u2019ve lost weight but by having such an adverse reaction to old photos, I think you need to process your entire weight loss journey with a professional.

It's not like you're asking for all photos of you to be removed, just the ones where it's only you. Can your mother not compromise and put them somewhere that's not completely out in the open? I don't agree with taking them without permission, but I do understand why you felt pushed to this point. I quite literally have taken away every trace of myself from ages 10-16 off the internet.

At the end of the day remind her she can still keep the photos and in a nice album for her to look at, just not on display where it's triggering for you. Much like parents who respect their kids not wanting their images shared on social media. However, you are an adult and not a minor, you do have a responsibility to work on this with therapy so that these photos don\u2019t have this effect on you.\n\nIf you can try to reframe how you feel about them, be proud of how far you came rather than focusing on the pain.

As a mum, my heart breaks for you. I would absolutely not want any reminders of a painful time for my kids.

I\u2019ve been transitioning for several years now and as time passed by I asked them to remove the pictures, which they didn\u2019t do. \n\nOne of the excuses they gave me was that they didn\u2019t have any pictures of my actual self and they wanted a part of me in their household (I don\u2019t like having my picture taken and I rarely take selfies, even with friends). I assume your mother feels the same way, and it might be one of the reasons she doesn\u2019t take anything down. So what I did is that I asked my friends if they had pictures of me, and made efforts to take some myself as well and gave them to my parents.\n\nThey still didn\u2019t take the pictures down so I did (left some of the ones with other people), and put them in a photo album and gave it to them. \nI told them I don\u2019t especially want the pictures to be destroyed, but they have to come to terms with the fact that the person on the pictures isn\u2019t who I am and I don\u2019t feel comfortable having them around for everyone (including me) to see.\nI do understand that parents like to have photos of their kids, for the memories and all, but those pictures are a harsh reminder (and from what I get it\u2019s the same for you) that I\u2019d rather not have to see every time I visit them. \n\nMaybe that\u2019s what you should do too, put the pictures in a photo album and gift it to your mother. If you feel like it you can propose her to fill it with all of the other pictures so she can still have them and look at them whenever she wants.\n\nOur situations might be different, but I suppose our feelings towards those pictures are rather close so I can understand a little.\nAlso, this situation is a two way street so maybe try to work on getting to a better understanding with your mother, both your communication skills suck (sorry).\n\nGood luck and congrats on your weight loss journey btw \u2728\ud83e\udef6", "Wtf is w the comments?

Don't listen to the people who grew up in a different situation and are commenting from that point of view. You're not crazy. They're not being mean, they just can't even imagine what it does to your brain and identity. Leave the photos alone, you're achieving nothing and letting her win.

If she still refuses to take them down; if I were in your shoes, I would personally not go to her house anymore. Everyone saying you need therapy has a good point but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019d still be ok with seeing pictures of your old self. You are a new person and that should be celebrated but you do also have to acknowledge who you were but that doesn\u2019t mean you should have to be constantly reminded of that person when you wish to move on.

Your mother because she seems hell bent on displaying pictures that make you uncomfortable. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I am going to comment on however is that it literally took your mother catching you in the act for her to notice.
