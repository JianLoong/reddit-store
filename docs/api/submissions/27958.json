Since the start of pregnancy she had a name in mind and it means a lot to her in terms of the name meaning and its associations. We've not really discussed the baby names seriously during pregnancy due to focus on other life priorities during that time, and I haven't put forward any name suggestions until after the baby was born. \n\nSo we've narrowed it down to two names, Upe (uh-peh) meaning River in our language and Veja (veh-yah, pronounced similarly to Freyah). Upe is the name that my wife wants and I'm not strictly against it but I'm not really excited about it. Veja (meaning wind) is the one that I proposed and my wife likes it but not as much as her option and it doesn't have the association with water which is important to her. We live in the UK and we're also a bit concerned about crude associations/name calling if we used name Veja (vajayjay, etc) but not sure how substantiated this is - any opinions from native speakers appreciated!\n\nI'd feel bad if my wife couldn't use her name, especially since it means that much for her, but at the same time that name doesn't excite me at all, although with time I would probably get used to it. I really like my suggestion andy wife quite likes it too but not sure if she won't eventually regret not picking her option due to its meaning to her. \n\nI should add that we only want to use one name, no middle names or double-barrelling. \n\nWIBTA if we named our child using my suggestion, given the importance of my wife's option to her and the time she had that name in her head?", "created_utc": 1696104713, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16wgkd6/wibta_if_i_didnt_want_to_use_my_wifes_suggestion/", "score": 1626, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He started looking at names and pitching things he kinda liked. There was nothing we could agree on. We fought about it a number of times due to being sleep deprived and emotional.

Upe is the name that my wife wants and I'm not strictly against it but I'm not really excited about it. Veja (meaning wind) is the one that I proposed and my wife likes it but not as much as her option and it doesn't have the association with water which is important to her.

My parents absolutely loved the name Aist\u0117 and were dead set on it, but they were worried about me being teased/mispronounced my whole life. So they wrote it on a piece of paper, showed it to the neighbours and asked them to read it. They didn't even know where to start.\n\nI now have a common name in both languages that's spelled the Lithuanian way, and Aist\u0117 for a middle name.\n\nOf course kids still found a way to pick on my \"normal\" first name, that's bound to happen. But even if miraculously none of the nicknames stick, I was still teased for all the trouble my last name gave the teachers to read, and it's probably so much worse if they can't even pronounce your first. Plus, while my bullies never paid enough attention to know my full name, my friends thought my middle name was so cool and were always begging me to name various objects in Lithuanian \ud83d\ude01\n\nThese days the name Aist\u0117 is very special to me, I like it even more than my first name, but I'm so glad I didn't grow up with it.\n\nI'm very sympathetic to your situation, and I would give a completely different verdict if you were in Lithuania - but given that you're living abroad, ESH for not properly considering your daughter's life with this name. Having a \"weird\" name might make her resent her culture instead of forming a connection with it. If you're really against using Up\u0117 as a middle name, may I suggest the first names Rasa, Marina, or even Audra? Why not revisit some of the more pronounceable options you crossed off the list earlier?", "NAH! \n\nbut if i may suggest, perhaps you could give your baby a name that has either upe/veja in it and use those as nicknames so the whole name isn\u2019t as bully-able. something like aveja (avaya) and just calling her veja so it becomes automatically associated with aveja instead of anything inappropriate since it plants that seed of association beforehand", "Veja will be called vagina in middle school\u2026.", "I\u2019m sorry has the baby already been born?

If you're worried about bullying, you can probably have their teacher call them by an anglicized name.  In my school growing up, we had an Asian family who all chose to use Americanized names of their given name and a Jewish family who all used their traditional Jewish names.
