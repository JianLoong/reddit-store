He added that he has given her multiple chances in the past, but she did not submit anything, and because he has to submit the report card grades soon, he has no choice but to give her a failing grade for her midterm.\n\nWhen my daughter got home, I asked to follow me to my room, showed her the email, and asked her to explain it. She apologized, and gave excuses, such as the fact that she found business to be hard and boring, despite the fact that she wanted to take it and I advised against it many times. I asked her if she could drop business for the rest of the year, and she said its not possible.\n\nI told her that she needed to work on all her missing assignments and submit them as soon as possible for the slight chance that she could get a passing grade for her midterm and overall get higher grades for the end of the school year. She gave me a list of all the assignments that she did not work and I had her immediately work on them.\n\nA few hours later, I heard her talking. I open the door, and I found her talking on her phone with her friends, while playing a game on her computer. After she was finished, I asked her to come and bring her phone to me. She asked why, and I told her that she couldn't take any breaks. I told her she had to get her assignments done and she couldn't afford wasting any more of her time than she already did. She begged me to get some time off to do her things and promised that this wouldn't happen again. I was adamant about that and took her phone. I told her if I caught her wasting her time again before finishing her business assignments, I would ground her. She called me the worst, and left the room.\n\nNow she's crying in her room. I wonder if I was hard on her but she needs to know that her actions have consequences, and that if she wanted to have time playing with her friends, then she shouldn't have failed her class in the first place.", "created_utc": 1667312454, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yj9yw6/aita_for_yelling_at_my_daughter_that_she_wasnt/", "score": 2812, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The situation she put herself in has made it clear that she doesn\u2019t feel the compulsion to do the work and was sitting in her room, wasting the limited time she had to work on the backlog of assignments. As a result, her access to her friends/social media/games was revoked - hopefully that lights a fire under her ass to do the work that should\u2019ve been done in the first place \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA Not failing the class needs to be her priority not talking on the phone and playing video games. Your daughter created this problem for herself, she needs to fix it. When she goes to university or gets a job no one is going to hold her hand to get her work done in a timely manner so it's best she learn the lesson sooner than later.", "NTA because she wasted too many chances and is obviously pushing boundaries, HOWEVER give her breaks. \n\nNot even adults can handle work without breaks, don't give her back the phone or pc, but she deffo needs around 15-20 minutes every hour at her age to rest her eyes and brain. Just like in school.", "NTA, but honestly, do you really think she\u2019ll do her best (or somewhat best) work with no breaks?\n\nhave her sit with you while doing the assignments. let her have breaks inbetween. i have found that giving 5-10 minute breaks for 1-2 of assignments completed works well. it will prevent being overwhelmed and give her something to work towards.", "While I don't think you're coming from the wrong place, I also don't think this is not the best way to go about handling this situation.\n\nIt's unrealistic to expect your daughter to sit down and do 2ish months of work in one sitting. That's not to say that she doesn't need to get it done, but work with her to create a plan that feels achievable by breaking up the work in a way that allows for breaks.\n\nIs this problem specific to this one class? Or is this happening in all of her classes? Because if it's just this one class it sounds like your daughter needs some support in this one area. Talk with her, and help her to identify what the problem is and what can be done to solve it. If this is a repeated pattern of neglecting to do her work across the board, then you need to have a bigger conversation about the importance of her education, and that choosing not to participate in school is not an option. If she doesn't want to participate in school, then she doesn't get to participate in fun things like video calls with friends. The same way that if adults don't go to work, they don't have the resources for things like phones/going out with friends. School is her job, she needs to be doing it.\n\nYou are NTA.", "NTA and I would have had her at the kitchen table to keep her on task.", "Info: is this a pattern? Does she frequently have a hard time getting assignments handed in? \n\nShe said she class was boring, when she was the one who wanted to take it.

I suggest moving study time to the kitchen or other area. You can ensure she is doing her homework and can give her breaks as she finishes an assignment.", "Define \"break\". Is it a chance to stretch, get a snack, walk around and go to the bathroom? Or is it a license to play on her phone, make calls and do a little gaming? She needs a clear definition of what counts as a break and what counts as goofing off. She says she wants to take a break, but what she really wants is to be able to goof off at will.\n\nNTA.", "NAH but everyone who's said she needs breaks is right, and I think you probably need to talk to her a bit more about the work she hasn't completed and where she got stuck. \n\nI know she said it's hard and boring, but that's not very informative about what actually happened\u2014did she miss one assignment and then get overwhelmed by a cycle of falling behind/trying to catch up/giving up? Was she not fully understanding the material? Was there an aspect of the assignments she couldn't figure out how to do? If she just got overwhelmed, having her sit down and do it all at once (with breaks!) might be fine, but if there's a gap in her understanding or ability to do the work, \"just do it\" isn't actually going to help her.\n\nSomething I only figured out after years of trial and error (mostly error) was that when I \"just can't\" do something, there's generally a reason, and, to be honest, it's never laziness. Laziness is \"I don't feel like it,\" not \"I just can't.\" I might put off laundry until tomorrow or order takeout instead of cooking because I'm lazy, but it's not the reason I end up failing to complete essential tasks that frankly shouldn't be that hard. That does tend to be an inexplicable \"I don't know, I just can't\" feeling, and I've realized that when it happens, it's usually because there's an obstacle of some kind: an aspect of the task I don't understand, something I don't really have the tools for, or an inability to easily break the task down into the steps necessary to complete it. To get the thing done, I usually have to figure out what the obstacles are (frequently, it's the break-down-into-steps thing). \n\nFor other people, the obstacles might take other forms, but learning to identify the roadblocks that prevent you from doing what you need to do is an essential skill, and it's not necessarily intuitive\u2014a kid needs help with that stuff. If you can help her figure out what stopped her from doing the work throughout the semester, you may be able to help her not only catch up but prevent it from happening again.", "YTA unless you are running a prison camp. Everyone needs breaks. It's how your brain and body  recharges.", "NTA, time management is a VITAL skill that I always wished (personally) was emphasized more for me growing up. I really struggled my first semester kn college cause I could not properly segment my time. \n\nShe's procrastinating, which is a normal human thing, but you as a parent are in charge of teaching her how to manage her time, responsibilities and commitments. \n\nOnly thing I would add is to teach her how to take breaks properly. My neuroscience professor always told us to work for 45min to 60min and then take a 5 minute break. Walk around. Get a healthy snack. Drink some water. Distract yourself enough to make sure you're not burning out and return to your task. That does not include video games and phone calls, regardless if you're 15 or 45.", "INFO: Has your daughter ever been evaluated for ADHD?", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t have time for computer games and phone calls, she has a mountain of assignments to make up for.

Does she usually slack on studies?\n\nIs she depressed?", "NTA I am currently going through the same thing with my  f15. In the end it's not about the assignments, its about how blas\u00e9 they are about failing.", "NTA for parenting your child. She clearly needs to make a change if she is struggling this much.", "YTA, but I understand the mentality behind it.\n\nAs a parent I totally understand the hell of homework and the teeth pulling to get it done.  I have 2 children with adhd and 1 also has autism.  Trying to get them to finish homework should be considered cruel and unusual punishment.\n\nThat said it sounds like you are pushing her hard to put her grades higher but I have a very important question.\n\nWhat happens if she fails the class?\n\nMost schools will have her retake it, or (because this sounds more like an elective) catch up the points for graduating elsewhere.  Absolute worst she doesn\u2019t get into a particular college or major she wants or takes an extra year to graduate.  That would be the natural consequences no?\n\nYour goal is good, your attitude of attacking the problem is not.  You need to figure out what the problem is.  She said boring and difficult so it could just be she\u2019s not understanding the material or even the teacher is not a good one and some tutoring could aid her in grasping concept better.  The homework part is needed yes but you said yourself the chance is slim that doing it will get her a good grade so why terrorize her over it?  Plan for the worst instead of trying to force an option that will cause harm, particularly to self esteem.\n\nThe fact that she did not come to you saying she has a problem and instead ignored and hid it speaks VOLUMES.  I did this as a kid because I got this same treatment.  The way you present it I am willing to bet it\u2019s not just \u201cSit and do your homework\u201d it\u2019s insults and screaming which doesn\u2019t help her at all.  Punishing her when she\u2019s already low doesn\u2019t help her at all.  You just make her feel even worse and more like you can\u2019t love her because of her flaws and failures.\n\nBreaks help.  Science actually shows this if you look up studies about concentration and studying.\n\nAlso talking to friends and playing a game is not \u201cwasting time\u201d it\u2019s self care.  She was trying to self soothe so she could work on the homework.  Would she have gotten back to it or lost in the games and friends forever?  Who knows! You certainly didn\u2019t let her even get to that point.  That\u2019s where those natural consequences come in.  No kid likes summer school but no one has ever died from it, or getting a bad grade.  Surprisingly I have never been denied a job for having gone to summer school as a kid.\n\nMaybe instead of cracking the proverbial whip and being a tyrant you should try empathizing with her.  Assure her this is not the end of the world and you still love her.  It\u2019s just a failure, and if it\u2019s one thing everyone has to learn it\u2019s healthy ways of dealing with failures and building yourself back up.  \n\nWhat you are teaching her is to put herself  last anytime Life shows up to kick her and that she\u2019s not worthy of time with friends or self care because she has shit to do.  No rest until the work is done.  No vacation allowed until everything in life is done.  Parent died? Oh she can\u2019t go to the funeral, she\u2019s got work to do and that comes before \u201cwasting time\u201d grieving.\n\nIs that what you want to see from your daughter?", "NTA. Your actions seem reasonable and fairly calm; you didn't blow up at her or impose any extreme consequences. As a parent of 2 20-somethings, including 1 who had similar difficulties in high school, I think this sounds like a typical parenting  situation & you're doing well. (My only suggestion is that you leave her door open.)", "Not *entirely* the asshole, but you need to get your daughter tested for ADHD. I\u2019m reading what you\u2019ve said about her behavior and seeing my teen self in it. I wasn\u2019t diagnosed until my mid 20s (parents thought I was just lazy, or unmotivated and never tested me) and it made high school and college unbearable which sent me spiraling into depression. Get her tested now and save her (and yourself tbh) a lot of strife in the future.", "ESH.  Why are you only *now* getting engaged enough in your daughter\u2019s schoolwork to be aware she\u2019s struggling?  You might be able to fix the immediate grade problem by forcing her to buckle down and pump out the missing work, but it\u2019s not actually a healthy or effective way to study, and it\u2019s not going to fix the bigger problem of her being disengaged and not taking the class seriously unless you crack down on her.  For that, you\u2019re going to have to actually talk to her about *why* she finds this so hard and work with her and the teacher to come up with a plan for addressing that.", "NTA. If it\u2019s to the point where she might not pass the class, she either needs to drop it or make up for it HEAVY. If I were you though, I\u2019d have her supervised while doing these make up assignments in order to be sure she\u2019ll finish enough of them in time. At this point, I wouldn\u2019t expect them to be better than a \u201cC\u201d however.", "NTA, though I do think you are a bit wrong in your approach. Could you sit and work an entire day or two without taking small breaks? I doubt it. While she should not be fooling around on her phone, she still should be allowed breaks here and there. Every hour or two, she needs 15-30 minutes to just blow of steam. Let her have her phone for those small breaks, let her watch an episode of a tv show. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t allow her to get behind again. I\u2019m honestly shocked the teacher is even allowing her to turn late work in. Times sure have changed from when I was in school. My high school teachers didn\u2019t accept late work beyond a day or two, except for special circumstances.", "For the bots, NTA. You're definitely in between a rock and a hard place. If I were in the same situation, I would consider just letting her do things her way. It'll be the hardest thing you've ever done (speaking from experience) but if there's an option for summer school or grade remediation, it's probably worth it to let her fail and experience those consequences. I'd also hire a tutor or academic coach for her if one is available at a reasonable cost and see if she needs help in planning and organization. \n\nWhat really sucks is that high school is higher stakes than it used to be. There's a lot expected from kids to the point where parents (myself included) get really involved in organizing for them. A little help can go a long way, but helping too much can create anxiety and prohibit them from developing those skills themselves.", "My mom did this to me once I hated her and it for maybe a week until I was caught up. She might hold a grudge for a whole month, but it's better in the long run.

However you should look into this more. Half way through high school I started doing poorly in classes. It was one here and there, then all of them, and it was mostly because I didn't hand in assignments, on the flip side I tested really well. Personally it was undiagnosed ADHD. It could just be teenage behavior but it could be something else", "Not the best way to handle situation.Having her work non stop with no breaks is unrealistic and not very productive.You are being hard on her after nort caring about her grades this whole time.You are not communicating with her and punishing her when she struggles in school.Soft yta", "Yes and no.

For her actions she deserves to be grounded. Don't second guess yourself. You are her parent first not her friend.", "NTA", "YTA breaks are essential. It is recommended with every hour or so of work you take a 10 mins break. I think you were right to make her do the assignments but you should have gone about it differently. Breaks are super important. Reward good behavior. If she finished an assignment let her take a break. There was a better way of going about this then having an argument and punishing her after she had already spent several hours working. She is lucky the teacher is allowing her to make up the assignments. My father saw grinding out work to be the best answer. I however do not work that way due to ADHD etc. It caused issues between us when things like this happened. What worked for you may not work for her. Sitting and doing work until it\u2019s all finished with no breaks and no spare time might not be the best for her.

A reasonable response to that is to remove the non-essential distractions until her work is completed.", "NTA\n\nShe is 15.

I'd be following up with her other teachers to see if there are any more surprises lurking.\n\nYou're N T A for taking her phone when finding her chatting with friends and playing games. You don't know how long she was avoiding work. But it's not a good tactic to say no breaks at all.\n\nI have ADD, and it took me a long time to put together good study habits. One thing that really helped me was a schedule. For me, it's often task based rather than time based, but either can work. Sit down with your daughter and build a schedule, or even a Kanban board. These are the assignments that need to be completed that day, and include her work from her other courses in that schedule. Build breaks in either after each task is done or after so much time has passed. More frequent breaks are shorter, less frequent breaks are longer.\n\nFollow up with her during the evening and at the end of the night. What's done, what's not done? Did she manage her time well, or did you need to step in and remind her to work? Celebrate the successes together.

School was so hard for me and I hated every second of it. Every night for 13 years was a crying screaming match over homework.

Punishments are just an outlet for your own anger/frustration over the situation and encourage hiding behaviour, like what caused this issue in the first place. You followed it up with more threats, which is repeating the same unproductive behaviour.\n\nAs a parent you're supposed to be supportive to your child. Just putting her in a room with a huge list of tasks isn't supportive in the slightest. Taking away distractions can help, it only works when done in cooperation with the child. But before that comes a breaking down of the list into manageable chunks, working with the child to create a healthy balance between working and rest (doing some joint physical activity would generally be preferred over electronics use).\n\nI could fault the teenager for her part of the behaviour to make it ESH, but when there seems to be such a direct link between behaviour and parenting style I find it hard to do that.", "NTA\n\nPlay stupid games, win stupid prizes.

He added that he has given her multiple chances in the past, but she did not submit anything, and because he has to submit the report card grades soon, he has no choice but to give her a failing grade for her midterm.\n\nWhen my daughter got home, I asked to follow me to my room, showed her the email, and asked her to explain it. She apologized, and gave excuses, such as the fact that she found business to be hard and boring, despite the fact that she wanted to take it and I advised against it many times. I asked her if she could drop business for the rest of the year, and she said its not possible.\n\nI told her that she needed to work on all her missing assignments and submit them as soon as possible for the slight chance that she could get a passing grade for her midterm and overall get higher grades for the end of the school year. She gave me a list of all the assignments that she did not work and I had her immediately work on them.\n\nA few hours later, I heard her talking. I open the door, and I found her talking on her phone with her friends, while playing a game on her computer. After she was finished, I asked her to come and bring her phone to me. She asked why, and I told her that she couldn't take any breaks. I told her she had to get her assignments done and she couldn't afford wasting any more of her time than she already did. She begged me to get some time off to do her things and promised that this wouldn't happen again. I was adamant about that and took her phone. I told her if I caught her wasting her time again before finishing her business assignments, I would ground her. She called me the worst, and left the room.\n\nNow she's crying in her room. I wonder if I was hard on her but she needs to know that her actions have consequences, and that if she wanted to have time playing with her friends, then she shouldn't have failed her class in the first place.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

All I said was that if OP can get a better sense of what in particular she\u2019s struggling with - which shouldn\u2019t be that difficult, given that OP seems to already have had a pretty good idea this might happen - she can talk to the teacher about *existing* strategies for tackling that.

If my kid were to cause a fender bender while texting and driving, they would no longer have a cell phone and/or access to a vehicle until they could prove that they were responsible enough to have access to those things again - I\u2019m failing to see how giving your child a repercussion for their actions and following through on it is wrong\u2026 how else do people learn from their mistakes?

Not her fault that she can\u2019t drop it and she was trying to find a reasonable solution that would work for her kiddo/trying to look out for her best interest), and her need to really buckle down to make sure she doesn\u2019t get a failing grade.

She didn\u2019t even take the stuff away once her daughter got home - she sent her to her room to do the work she needed to do and her daughter decided to mess around. I\u2019m 100% positive that this woman felt incredibly frustrated and said \u201cno breaks\u201d while taking away the phone, computer and social media. If you read further, she told her daughter that if she found her wasting time again, the daughter would be grounded - to me that means that she hasn\u2019t cut off other forms of breaks like going for walks, spending study/work time at home with friends, extra curricular activities, etc., so there are still options for breaks there, just not with the phone/computer. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to assume that she means no breaks whatsoever as that isn\u2019t healthy and will burn anyone out and she seems to give a shit about her kid\u2019s mental well-being and her education. She is clearly questioning how she handled the situation with how emotional her daughter is being over this, so she doesn\u2019t seem neglectful/like she doesn\u2019t care about her daughter\u2019s emotional state. Sometimes parents make decisions that kids don\u2019t like and have a very adverse reaction to - that doesn\u2019t mean that the parent did the wrong thing, but they will still question themselves as they don\u2019t want their kids to hurt/be upset.", "True.

If he is having issues with remembering things for school, I would recommend getting a planner that he physically writes in when a new task/assignment comes in and sets an alarm on his phone at the end of the day/whenever best suits him to look at the planner to see if there is anything missing. I have several alarms I set for myself in the morning to keep me on time to get my son and I out the door on time as I putter around in the mornings and quickly lose track of time. It sounds like he is getting the support he needs at home, he just needs to come up with a plan that is reasonable enough for him to follow through on (nothing too complicated as that can discourage people if it\u2019s too much all at once) and put it into practice. I\u2019m saying this gently and with care - if something isn\u2019t working for him, and he tells you that it doesn\u2019t work, don\u2019t try to push that particular thing on him.

I heard a question sound, but didnt internalize the actual question. Yup. Uh uh. I did it.\" version to have them stop what theyre doing, look at you and focus. Then ask again and have them think before they answer. This overrides the impulsivity.\n\nThe first version is harder. Because the first step is the kid knowing you won't be mad. Even if its a big error. So, you approach it more as a shared task than as a failure. We each have responsibilities - the kids is to communicate and try, yours is to manage, teach, and help with coping skills.\n\nI dont have kids. So im trying to do all of that on my own. But I ALWAYS lied to my parents, especially if it was a big deal, because of the \"But you can do better\" guilt trip. To be clear, I dont think thats what you're doing - but its likely what he is afraid of even if its not your style. That method is pervasive in our society, and he probably has friends who's parents are like that, or teachers who do it to him.\n\nMaybe approaching it with him like a problem you solve together will help. Or giving him a non-verbal or time delayed way to answer if you can. And have his therapists talk to him about the impulse to lie, guilt/shame, etc.\n\nHe had a lot of years of being told \"you should be able to do these things\" - again, maybe not by you, but that might not matter.
