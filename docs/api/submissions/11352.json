There's nothing there too have a relationship with.\n\nI didn't say that to my parents. Just that I wasn't coming home. They say I am TH and will barely speak to me. They say I promised.

But your parents chose to have a child, and by so doing accepted whatever might come.  They chose.  You were raised to believe you have a responsibility that actually is theirs, not yours.  No surprise, once you left home and experienced life outside the family, you developed your own interests\u2014and realized your future did not (and should not) have to include being a full time caretaker for your brother.  I\u2019m sorry this has driven a wedge between you and your parents, but you need to live your life for you and your husband.  It is frankly wrong for your parents to try to guilt-trip you into caring for your brother.  There are other options, and your parents can choose to explore them or continue as they are.", "NTA. Your brother is not your responsibility, and no, your parents cannot hold you to a promise you made as a child. You can still be supportive in helping them find care for your brother though.

I grew up with a profoundly disabled sibling, who passed away as a teenager.  I was always anticipating caring for her when my parents couldn\u2019t any longer but that obviously didn\u2019t happen as she died young.

Good luck.  kt", "NTA. You promised when you were well under the age of consent for contract, so it has no bearing....ok jokes aside, of course you're not an AH. That's not a promise they extracted, that's coercion. It sucks that your parents are in this position, but at the same time, your brother is not your responsibility to take on.\n\nThe kind thing would be to offer financial aid if you can give it to hire a home health aid. Your parents are getting older, and that type of care is expensive.

It's a terrible sadness for your parents as well as for you, but your brother isn't your lifelong responsibility. Stay in France, and tell your parents you're staying in France. If they start in with the \"you promised\" nonsense remind them that they never gave you a choice to say no, but you're saying it now. And that does NOT make you any kind of A  H.", "Absolutely NTA. OP, as a kid, you cannot consent. That\u2019s why your signature is not legally required until you turn 18; children cannot comprehend or plan for the future or whatever with big decisions. This is a MASSIVE decision and responsibility, and I cannot stress enough that not only could you not possible be beholden to your \u201cagreement\u201d until you had gone out and experienced life and been an adult, but THEY DID NOT GIVE YOU A CHOICE. Your parents said you WILL take care of him. You couldn\u2019t give consent period, to anything, but you especially could not give INFORMED consent. It wasn\u2019t an agreement because there was nothing to agree or disagree to. You were told you had to do this one thing, no if and or buts. You do not need to and should not give up this wonderful life to take over the job of your parents. They didn\u2019t even give you a proper timeline to agree to, just \u201cwhenever we decide and feel like it, we\u2019re going to pass off our kid to be your problem now\u201d. They clearly know that you\u2019d feel morally obligated to take on his care, because they tried to guilt trip you to manipulate you into agreeing, so they should\u2019ve known you likely did not want to take that task on. That\u2019s why they never gave you a choice to begin with. They didn\u2019t give you room to say no. They essentially are trying to leave their kid on your doorstep and bail because they\u2019re tired of being his caretakers. There\u2019s facilities for when parents cannot for whatever reason take care of their disabled child. They had nearly thirty years to plan for what his care would be and they did not, not because you\u2019re betraying them suddenly and going back on your \u201cword\u201d that wasn\u2019t even YOUR word, it was theirs, but because they were careless and lazy and didn\u2019t bother preparing an alternative. That\u2019s THEIR fault, that\u2019s THEIR kid. He\u2019s not and never has been your responsibility. It\u2019s unfortunate, your brother\u2019s situation, but you didn\u2019t cause that situation, his parents did. They have other options, so don\u2019t let them keep on the narrative that you\u2019re their only choice. I know it hurts, but it\u2019s probably better that your parents barely speak to you. I\u2019m sorry they\u2019re doing that to you, but that is ALSO on them, not you. They want to pass the fault onto you to hide from the truth, that truth being that they didn\u2019t plan for this, and now they can\u2019t throw him and the responsibilities that come with his care onto someone else to wipe their hands of the situation. They\u2019re mad because they have to take care of their child and arrange and pay for care. You said no, end of discussion. There\u2019s this concept of obligation with these sorts of situations and I cannot stress enough that you owe no one anything at the expense of your entire life and well-being. Would you expect someone besides yourself to take up the torch and tell them they were awful for not abiding by a \u201cpromise\u201d they didn\u2019t even make because they were never ASKED to begin with, but were TOLD? Would you agree to yank your heart out while you\u2019re still using it and pass it over to someone just because they need it, too? No, that\u2019s silly. That\u2019s unhealthy. That\u2019s crazy, right? Now apply that to this. Trading your entire life, likely at the expense of your marriage (caretaking is a huge stressor for marriages), your health, your mental well-being, your financial well-being, etc., for your brother? You gave your childhood. They chose to have a child, and disabilities like his are always a possibility when having a child. You don\u2019t owe it to them to ruin everything you\u2019ve worked towards because they can\u2019t plan for the future and are being selfish. \n\nYou aren\u2019t evil or mean or selfish for not wanting to take care of him, or for resenting him a bit, or for not wanting to uproot your entire life to be his caretaker. You were neglected in favor of his needs, not that his needs shouldn\u2019t have been met or are his fault, because they aren\u2019t, but you are still being neglected by your parents in favor of his needs. Parents that truly love their children more than they care about their selfish wants wouldn\u2019t dream of forcing this onto them. They\u2019d want to see you happy and healthy and living a good life, even if they had to then find another care option. There\u2019s hundreds of options and facilities for them to look at. They\u2019re not dead yet, so they can look and find the one they\u2019d like him to be in, or if at home medical care is an option. Think of your husband, too, as well as yourself. If your parents are willing to stop speaking to you often or at all because they were told no, you won\u2019t ruin your entire being for a kid that isn\u2019t yours, that\u2019s their choice and shows you who they truly are. You might figure out that you don\u2019t want people like this in your life to begin with. I know I wouldn\u2019t, but that\u2019s another choice you may have to make. You deserve to have your needs met for once, OP. You deserve to finally be free and happy and loved in the way you have always deserved, fully and unconditionally. I\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t get that growing up. Don\u2019t let them steal that from you now that you have it, though, because you\u2019ve earned this. You\u2019ve fought for it and you\u2019ve more than earned this life, and they have no right to deprive you of that, nor should they ever want to. Your brother is another innocent party in all this, but so are you. Don\u2019t let them make you think any different.", "Okay but they are RETIRING not DYING??? Do they think they get to retire from being this guy\u2019s parent? NTA, OP, obviously", "NTA. Could have been handled better on your parents end I guess. They could have asked if you could take care of him France once they passed, he could be moved to France rather than you uprooting your life.

It was something I was so glad / grateful to do. My brother and I traded off overnights and did our best to keep him home and comfortable. We both have full time jobs, and lives / homes of our own.

This likely isn't an easy situation with an easy solution for your parents if they had only been willing. They likely are very upset at you beacuse they feel trapped and have no idea what to do.\n\nIf you care about your parents or your relationship with them (and given, I'm not sure if you do) maybe agree to help them figure out their options for your brothers care. Maybe even visit and help meet with social workers or something? But don't be surprised if there isn't just an easy option your parents can afford to have him in good quality care. I get that's where he needs to go, I agree, but that dosen't always mean it's available to your family. Sadly, our system does not always provide people with what they need.", "So people with disabilities are a burden. Cool. Thanks.

That's the very definition of \"burden\".", "How much experience do you have for caring for a person with severe disabilities? I'm genuinely asking, because if you are a full-time carer for someone who is non-verbal, non-mobile, and unable to interact in any meaningful way with you, and you don't feel even a little burdened by that? Then you are actually a saint. If you have not spent years doing this with no break, no hope for improvement, and little to no support, and you're being this judgemental? Maybe you need to take a step back and think about why you feel so strongly about other people's lived experiences.", "I agree. None of this if the brother\u2019s fault, that\u2019s the the only point I was trying to make. That OP blaming her brother, feeling jealousy and resentment towards him (I\u2019m not saying she can\u2019t feel however she wants, but acting on that jealousy is something different) is not fair to him. Her parents have handled this badly, but they\u2019re hardly the first parents to get a situation like this wrong. There are plenty of examples of parents with a disabled child doing the opposite, especially in the past: ignoring and pushing the disabled child away, putting their disabled child in an institution and pouring all their love, attention, and support into their able-bodied children. In fact, that used to be the norm, and encouraged by authorities.

The issue is that her parents just assumed it was going to happen, and had zero inclination to consider what to do in the likely event of her not using her life to cover their obligation.", "Parents can't just \"retire\" taking care of children who need care...he's not your kid and you have your life in France. \n\nDO NOT GO HOME, I repeat don't.
