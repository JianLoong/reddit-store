The doctor had been concerned because the baby was not in the right position for birth. So I was told that they were going to do an \"external cephalic version\" (ECV), which is when the doctor uses her hands on the belly to cause pressure for the baby to move into the right position. While doing this, I was being monitored by their computer,  and the baby's heart was also being monitored.  It was very uncomfortable but I know the doctor was being safe. \n\nUltimately, it did not work, so they scheduled a c-section for the following week, but told me that if the baby had moved to the right position by then, they would induce me for a vaginal birth.\n\nThe day of the ECV, I told my extended family including my MIL. She is from Mexico and likes to do traditional home remedies and treatments for her ailments.  One of the traditions she has is visiting a \"sobadora\". Which is like a masseuse that claims to fix many problems using their herbal oils and chiropractic techniques. Well she suggested that I go to this woman to turn the baby, and that way I could avoid the c-section.\n\nI told her many times that day that I wouldn't trust someone to work on my belly without monitoring my baby's heart. I thought she understood that I was against this idea, but the following morning she knocked at my door and she had the sobadera lady with her.\n\nI tried to be nice to them and tried to explain how I wasn't comfortable letting her touch me, but they kept insisting.  It got to the point that i was so angry that I yelled at both of them to leave because the sobadera was not a doctor and she is not qualified to do any treatment on me. They left, but my MIL called me an ungrateful snob.\n\nThe following week my baby had still not moved, so I did end up getting a c-section. But my baby is healthy and I am grateful to the doctors who helped deliver her to me safely. \n\nBut now it's been a couple weeks since my argument with my MIL, and even though she loves on the baby, she is very short with me and she told me I should apologize for how rude I was to her. I don't want to apologize because I feel she was the one who was out of line. My husband was always supportive of my decision and was backing me up, but somehow,  my MIL still doesn't get that she was inappropriate in what she was asking me to do. My sister in laws both said that I should have given it a chance since it could have helped me avoid the c-section, and that I acted like a-hole to the sobadora my saying she wasn't a doctor.\n\nSo AITAH for the way I refused the traditional treatment?", "created_utc": 1701020838, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184g9g0/aita_the_way_i_acted_when_refusing_my_mils_idea/", "score": 2203, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Lavender for migraines, aloe for burns, oregano oil and echinacea for colds and flus. Some of my stuff even the natural remedy leaning folks have raised an eye brow at. \n\nBut I\u2019m also very much, antibiotics for infections. Vaccines for communicable diseases. And absolutely trained professionals for anything to do with babies and childbirth procedures. \n\nCould the sobadora helped? Maybe. Maybe not. Ultimately, it was your body and your baby and your feelings, reservations, and reasons (monitoring baby\u2019s heartbeat) were more than valid. Alternative birth supporters will argue that midwives, sobadoras and the like have been used for hundreds of years. But a lot of woman also died in childbirth, and a lot of babies died stillborn, before modern medicine. There\u2019s absolutely no reason to take that chance when your regular doctors had the situation covered.", "NTA.\n\nListen, I'm Mexican and grew up with a mom that also believes in sobadoras and home remedies (teas and egg cleansings), so I get where your MIL is coming from, and she 100% had the best of intentions, and was honestly sure that it would help.\n\n\nThat being said, there's a time and place for home remedies and a time and place for western medicine.\n\n\nOne time I hurt my leg going down a slide at McDonald's. I was visibly limping, so my mom took me straight to a sobadora to get fixed up. The lady took one look at my ankle and said \"Oh this is broken, she needs a doctor\". \n\n\n(side note: why we didn't sue I'll never understand cause I was a damn cute kid, and I got hurt cause one of the bolts on the slide was not fastened properly. We could have been McMillionaires). \n\n\nAnyway, she didn't even touch me because she was aware that this was beyond her own abilities. That's what a good sobadora does. They can help with a creak in your neck, a stress ball on your back, and a few other basic things that are genuinely ailing you, but they can't mend broken bones.\n\n\nIt's possible she could have turned the baby, there are ways to do it that are similar to what your doctor did. But the point was that you weren't comfortable doing so, and it's unfair to try to force you. \n\n\nYour MIL might be a bit upset that you rejected something from her culture, as well as something she considers advice from one mother to another. More than anything her feelings are a bit hurt and probably embarrassed that you said that in front of the sobadora, who more than likely she knows pretty well.\n\n\nIf you want to try to mend the relationship, I would say something like \"MIL, I'm sorry that our relationship has become strained over this. I was stressed out due to what the doctor said about the baby's position and having to do an unwanted c section. I understand you were trying to help with the sobadora, and I truly do appreciate the sentiment. But the doctor had already done a similar procedure to the sobadora, and it didn't work. I've been with my doctor through my whole pregnancy, so I believed them when they said that it wouldn't work. I'm sure the sobadora is incredible at what she does, otherwise you wouldn't trust her with your daughter in law and grandchild, but I don't know her, and didn't feel comfortable with her making an attempt. Please know that I love you, I trust you, and I want us to move forward from this.\"\n\n\nIf she's anything like my mom, this might be enough to get her to understand your point, while also letting the passive aggression go. I don't know if she'll apologize or even realize she was in the wrong, my mom certainly wouldn't, but something like the above might at least let her understand that you don't hate/mistrust/look down on her.", "NTA.\n\nMIL *wildly* overstepped. This was not her call to make, and if she was embarrassed in front of the sobadora, it\u2019s her own fault. And your SILs are flat out wasting their time - you can\u2019t go back and make different choices now, so whining about what they think you *should* have done is both pointless and obnoxious. \n\nAnd the sobadora is *not* a doctor, that is factually true. And kind of the point, no? Traditional healers appeal to people who either can\u2019t access, or do not trust, actual doctors. The fact that they\u2019re not doctors is the selling point. Arguing this point with you is nonsensical. They\u2019re just piling on to make you feel like *you* were the one out of line. \n\n\nI hope your husband continues to back you, and that you and baby get some time to peacefully heal and bond.

WERE you rude? Did you yell, raise your voice, tell her to take her quack out of your house?
