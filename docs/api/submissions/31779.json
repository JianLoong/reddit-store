The doctor had been concerned because the baby was not in the right position for birth. So I was told that they were going to do an \"external cephalic version\" (ECV), which is when the doctor uses her hands on the belly to cause pressure for the baby to move into the right position. While doing this, I was being monitored by their computer,  and the baby's heart was also being monitored.  It was very uncomfortable but I know the doctor was being safe. \n\nUltimately, it did not work, so they scheduled a c-section for the following week, but told me that if the baby had moved to the right position by then, they would induce me for a vaginal birth.\n\nThe day of the ECV, I told my extended family including my MIL. She is from Mexico and likes to do traditional home remedies and treatments for her ailments.  One of the traditions she has is visiting a \"sobadora\". Which is like a masseuse that claims to fix many problems using their herbal oils and chiropractic techniques. Well she suggested that I go to this woman to turn the baby, and that way I could avoid the c-section.\n\nI told her many times that day that I wouldn't trust someone to work on my belly without monitoring my baby's heart. I thought she understood that I was against this idea, but the following morning she knocked at my door and she had the sobadera lady with her.\n\nI tried to be nice to them and tried to explain how I wasn't comfortable letting her touch me, but they kept insisting.  It got to the point that i was so angry that I yelled at both of them to leave because the sobadera was not a doctor and she is not qualified to do any treatment on me. They left, but my MIL called me an ungrateful snob.\n\nThe following week my baby had still not moved, so I did end up getting a c-section. But my baby is healthy and I am grateful to the doctors who helped deliver her to me safely. \n\nBut now it's been a couple weeks since my argument with my MIL, and even though she loves on the baby, she is very short with me and she told me I should apologize for how rude I was to her. I don't want to apologize because I feel she was the one who was out of line. My husband was always supportive of my decision and was backing me up, but somehow,  my MIL still doesn't get that she was inappropriate in what she was asking me to do. My sister in laws both said that I should have given it a chance since it could have helped me avoid the c-section, and that I acted like a-hole to the sobadora my saying she wasn't a doctor.\n\nSo AITAH for the way I refused the traditional treatment?", "created_utc": 1701020838, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184g9g0/aita_the_way_i_acted_when_refusing_my_mils_idea/", "score": 111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My doctor also attempted a version which was unsuccessful.  C-section was the only way to go.  The c-section revealed that my daughters umbilical was short, very short, like roughly 6 inches long according to the doctor.  Had the version been successful it would have torn the umbilical cord and likely killed my daughter.  And that doctor's office was attached to the hospital and the OR was just down a  hallway from the office.", "NTA\n\nIt was your mother-in-law who crossed the line, not you.

However, when there is such a significant possibility of harm to your unborn child that the doctor was monitoring the baby's heartbeat when he performed this procedure, there is no chance I would have allowed this unknown person to practice on me and my child in your situation. \n\nI assume your MIL meant well. However she is absolutely wrong. She refused to respect your boundaries, demanded that you allow her to risk harming you and your baby regardless of what you chose, and is throwing a rudeness tantrum because you defied her when you had every right and an obligation to do so. Her judgement is so far gone right now that I would not allow unsupervised contact with your child.\n\nI hope someone can explain this to her so that she understands.", "NTA no means no. You refused consent to have somebody touch your body, and she doubled down on this other person being able to touch your body. Ask whether they also expect all children in the family to think consent doesn't matter.", "Babies can die when you attempt to turn them. They had to turn my youngest and I could tell the doctor was a little nervous. I had several electrodes on my stomach that monitored the heartbeat, a nurse was doing a sonogram while the doctor turned the baby and I also got a massive dose of Terbutaline to make my uterus relax. It's not something amateurs should be doing.", "MIL wants to do something, you say no thank you. She asks again, you say no thank you. She shows up at your house and demands that you do it, you say no thank you. She refuses to leave and now demands an apology.

Sobadoras are **NOT** doctors and they are supposed to be very in sync with \"vibes\" so this lady trying to touch you against your will is not even a good Sobadora.  \n\n\nTell your Husband to stop this now and please be VERY careful because your MIL might try to take your daughter to the Sobadora which is extremely dangerous.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
