The program coordinator showed up with their passports he kept for emergencies like this (super culty!) and claimed he paid the police off. After a few more incidents, suspicions were raised that this was a con with the coordinator and the police where the cops shuffle the missionaries to the station and a few hundred in local currency would be paid out of view of the missionaries... but they suspected the coordinator split the bribe as a means of taking the money the missionaries brought or should receive.
