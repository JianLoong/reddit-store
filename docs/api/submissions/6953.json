He lost. NTA.", "\n\nNTA for so many reasons\u2026\n\n>The problem was that their volunteer coodinator was holding on to their important documents so they wouldn't get misplaced, and one of those things were his passport. \n\nAs soon as I read this snippet, I immediately thought this was a human trafficking situation. (I used to do anti-trafficking work.) A huge red flag for trafficking is taking away someone\u2019s legal documentation, like passports, when they enter a foreign country so they can\u2019t escape. There\u2019s no legitimate reason (that I can think of) that someone would need to hold onto someone\u2019s passport \u201cso it wouldn\u2019t get misplaced.\u201d\n\n>The coordinator said he would only give it back after his 2 years were finished.\n\nI\u2019m sure he did. I would be surprised if when those 2 years are up, there\u2019s going to be another excuse or reason for why he should keep it.\n\n\n>He asked if I could get it back for him since the coordinator is my uncle. \n\nNot going to lie, didn\u2019t see this plot twist coming. I\u2019m really sorry to hear that not only is your family caught up in this, but is actively trafficking people.\n\n>I spoke to my uncle and he said he knew I was the one who corrupted him and basically told me to kick rocks. I told him I would call the police on him if he didn't give him back the passport and he said I didn't have the balls. \n\nThe audacity of this man\u2026 \n\n>So I called the police and they redirected me to the Australian embassy. \n\nGood for you. You would have been TA if you sat back and let your uncle continue to do this. \n\n>My uncle was fined quite a hefty amount and told him he had 3 days to return the passport or they would start the process to charge him with human trafficking.\n\nLooks like I\u2019m not the only one thinking of the human trafficking connection. Your uncle is quite lucky that the worst he got was a fine.\n\n\n>Word got around his church and now he's been released from his paid coordinator position. \n\nI have to be honest, I\u2019m pleasantly surprised by this. I was expecting the church to be fully in on what he was doing. (They could still be and just let him go to avoid police involvements.) There are more faith-based groups/organizations that engage in human trafficking behaviors than folks like to think. \n\n\n>My family are saying I went to far and that I only did this because he insisted me and that they knew he would have given the volunteer his documents back.  \n\nYour family is full of bullshit here. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re lying, but I am saying they have no basis for this statement. You don\u2019t know that he would have given the documents back to the volunteer. The volunteer has clearly tried that already and your uncle denied him at least once before. Chances are, the volunteer exhausted all of his options before calling you. This shows me that this is a pattern of conduct with your uncle\u2014a pattern that would have continued until someone stepped up. If you hadn\u2019t, he would have continued to exploit that volunteer and other volunteers. (Also, I highly doubt this was an isolated incident. He\u2019s probably done this to other volunteers in the past. People don\u2019t start resorting to this kind of coercion and over night.)\n\n>That he has too many physical problems to get another job and I shouldn't have said anything. \n\nAs someone who is disabled, I have a lot of sympathy for how physical problems can impact your ability to get a job. That being said, weaponizing his disabilities as justification for why he shouldn\u2019t be held accountable for his actions is disgusting. You did the right thing.\n\n\n>I'm starting to think maybe I did the wrong thing and should've tried other avenues before going straight to the police.\n\nWhat other avenues could you have tried? You literally called up your uncle and tried to handle this privately and he acted like an AH. He was exploiting someone and prevented them from returning home.
