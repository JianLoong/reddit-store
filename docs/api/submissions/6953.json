And you saved those people who he was victimizing.", "NTA \n\nAll day, every way.\n\nYou were right to call him out for an illegal act.  The passports are property of the issuing  nation so it was wrong for us ncle to hold them.\n\nCase closed.", "NTA. By holding onto the volunteer\u2019s passport your uncle was human trafficking/engaging in modern day slavery. Thank you for helping the volunteer out and effectively setting him free.", "NTA! That church/cult is basically setting up an indentured servitude situation for \u201cmissionaries\u201d.

Okay stupid games win stupid prizes.", "nope, your uncle fkd around and found out the hard way.  \nNTA - he was basically holding the passport hostage and as an extension a human hostage.   \nno one should have their human rights taken away (in this case the freedom to return home)", "NTA He literally kidnapped someone and then dared you to call the police.", "NTA. You simply can\u2019t force somebody to work/volunteer against their will. Your uncle fucked around, and found out. You have nothing to feel bad about, I would say quite the opposite.", "NTA. Wow, your uncle really blew it. The only reason he was in trouble was due to his actions.", "NTA. Anyone supporting human trafficking are beyond AHs. They are criminals and should all be reported", "NTA. You tried asking for the documents and he illegally refused. The next avenue was contacting the authorities.", "NTA. Thank you. Thank you so much for doing this. What your uncle was doing was illegal and immoral and the fact that this isn't uncommon just makes me sick.", "NTA AT ALL and congratulations for getting out of whatever religious movement this is. Whether it is Scientology, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, Mormons, or anything else, this is trafficking, and a well-documented abusive cult tactic used to keep members in line. You should be so proud of yourself. \nSide note - I\u2019m an avid scholar of New Religious Movements and cults and if you are ever interested I can provide you with a ton of resources to read, watch, engage with, and/or seek help from. You are not alone.", "NTA. Don't do illegal things and you won't have to face the consequences for dubious activities.", "NTA - you asked him nicely, you warned him what would happen, it\u2019s all his own choices!", "NTA\n\nI think you absolutely did the right thing; you're a good human - opposite of an asshole in fact. Your family is saying they knew your uncle would give the volunteer his documents back, but why did you uncle have them in the first place...? Glad he got punished!", "sorry, was this a church or a cult?  not sure from your description.\n\nyou are not at fault here.  people cannot hold passports hostage in the name of Dog.

Your uncle wouldn't have gotten in trouble if he didn't do anything illegal. He has to take responsibility for his actions, not you.", "Yep, I used to work on transnational crime issues and withholding travel documents is a classic technique deployed by human traffickers and exploiters of migrant labour. Your uncle deserved what he got; glad the Church actually did the right thing and fired him instead of just tut-tutting piously. Absolutely NTA.", "NTA - could you try talking to your family in a language they would understand. You could tell them you had a calling and God told you to do it", "You did a great thing. I think your uncle should be prosecuted anyway but good job turning it in", "NTA. He was literally holding that passport at ransom for \"volunteer\" work. \n\nIt's pretty cut and dry, legally and morally.

He's old enough to know right from wrong, as well as the law.", "NTA, soooo many churches (cults) believe they're above the laws, and it was straight up abusive for him to withold that persons passport, not to mention, theft.

My college friend was sent on his mission to a foreign country that wss known for police corruption. They received $5 equivalent per day to feed themselves and provide for their personal needs (aka hardly enough to feed yourself) while the coordinator held onto the rest of their money to \"grease the wheels\" if/when they were arrested. It took several weeks but they did end up harassed and taken to the station because they didn't have proper ID. The program coordinator showed up with their passports he kept for emergencies like this (super culty!) and claimed he paid the police off. After a few more incidents, suspicions were raised that this was a con with the coordinator and the police where the cops shuffle the missionaries to the station and a few hundred in local currency would be paid out of view of the missionaries... but they suspected the coordinator split the bribe as a means of taking the money the missionaries brought or should receive. My friend's missionary partner went home disgusted while my friend remained."]}
