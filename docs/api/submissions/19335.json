If this was your own daughter, would you have been reluctant to look after her? This is going to be a problem for the rest of your lives, because she will always feel excluded.

And at 6, you don't exactly have the life experience to work through it calmly. \n\nWe also don't know the circumstances around the breakup between the little girl's parents, or how long it has been.

Are you expected to care for her solo right now or are you saying you just don't want to have her at your house while you're pregnant? I think it's reasonable for him to provide primary care for her, but it's not ok to ask that he ditch her while you're pregnant. It's important to realize this child is going to be in your life forever as you are giving birth to her sibling. She's lashing out because of the baby.

I get upset don\u2019t get me wrong but I don\u2019t take it out on her, I leave the room to calm down.  I\u2019ve spent the last 11 months of us living together trying to make her feel secure in the situation and I feel like nothing I\u2019m doing is helping.

I understand his wants to do the best he can for his daughter because when she is at her mom\u2019s she doesn\u2019t get all the attention she wants and she is kind of absent despite it being her time, but I think he is too focused on making it positive when he has her he overcompensates and excuses things.", "Her parents haven\u2019t been together in 3 years and we\u2019re never married.

Ever since I met her she didn\u2019t seem to like the word no, I have a feeling they didn\u2019t say it much. They moved into my place 11 months ago and she lashes out every time it\u2019s said. And the lashing out is usually on my things (most are from my dad who died 5 years ago). She knows I love her, she tells me she loves me all the time.

Her and I can get along fine, we play together and I take her out places and she says she loves me. The problem is it doesn\u2019t last.

If op was a man and his step daughter cried foul and said he hurt her he would be in jail but since it\u2019s a women and she knew he had a daughter when she met him she just has to shut up and take being the main care giver to a child who lashes out at her.

I am not judging you. I will be the first person to say HELL NO I would not be a stepmom. I simply know myself and it's not in me.", "That's completely fair.  Add in a picnic at lunch or after work for just the two of them or a stop for ice cream and make it a thing for them to share while you get a couple of months with baby during the day.  Sounds fair.", "Stepmoms are always evil on this honey! It\u2019s ok to bond with your baby without having to deal with a child who acts out. Your doing your best and that\u2019s all anyone can ask. Good luck and congrats.", "NTA. Why should you have to watch her all day when there is free childcare at her dads work? You are going to be tired and if you end up needing a c-section or something you won\u2019t physically be capable of taking care of both kiddos. It would be prudent to anticipate SD to go to daycare at least for a while so all bases are covered after you have the baby. \n\nBetween exhaustion from baby needing to eat every two hours and getting up at night and the exhaustion from childbirth, I almost passed out several times during the first few weeks after my first daughter was born. I was trying to do all the things and would forget to eat because I was so wrapped up in trying to care for one newborn. SD deserves to be in a situation where there will be dedicated, alert childminders, and you deserve time to adjust to your healing body and new baby. Being overwhelmed isnt going to make your relationship with SD any better. And she\u2019s old enough to be in daycare and little summer camp programs without concern. She would probably even think it\u2019s special because she gets to go to work with dad. When I was a kiddo I thought going to work with my mom was the epitome of cool lol", "Not the asshole, but this seems like a major problem that is not going away.

It is understanable that you want to enjoy this precious time with your newborn.  You need to take a look at the reality of what married life would look like. And this is not the fault of th 6yr old, she is a product of her upbringing.  This tells you something about your fiance too. How much effort has he invested in parenting his daughter? He can't shift blame on this one. Keep your eyes open and be realistic when making your decisions so that kids dont get hurt", "If she\u2019s mean to your dog, how will she act to the new baby!

It\u2019s when it comes to her that we butt heads because he wants everything to be positive and he wants to have a good time with her and sometimes ignores the problems to do so and tolerates it too much. She has always been his entire world, it was the two of them against the world. When it\u2019s just us we are great it is with her we have some of the problems but it\u2019s only when she is acting out.

I was off work by the time she was out of school so he never tried since.", "That was how I felt. It is great for both them. \n\nIt was my biggest worry and he said that wouldn\u2019t be the case he knows she lies sometimes and he knows who I am as a person and what I\u2019m capable of, but there is fear there and I just also don\u2019t want the stress for the baby, they feel that off of us. \n\nI told him I wasn\u2019t as sure anymore because of all these issues. I want to be in a secure place before that commitment", "Marriage is something I have told him in the last few months I wasn\u2019t as sure about anymore. He claims he still is but I feel like with the way it is now it won\u2019t work. I don\u2019t want to give up on him and I do love his daughter we used to have a better relationship than this, the issues started after they moved in and seemed to appear more if I told her no or he was giving me too much attention. I thought we could work through it and we have tried, they have designated them time, specific activities for just them but I know she gets more time with me than him now because of his working and I think it makes it harder for her. I know her time with her mom isn\u2019t perfect either and I think she feels safe lashing out about it here, but I struggle with the fact it is mostly directed at me and it\u2019s my stuff she breaks when she lashes out.  Our pregnancy wasn\u2019t planned and I\u2019ve had a hard time with it, lots of problems throughout the entire thing andI wanted a few weeks without having her all day right after the baby is born so I can adjust to the change too because it\u2019s hard to help others when I can\u2019t help me and get my footing", "I also said in the post it\u2019s for a few weeks while I heal after birth and figure out being a new bio mom.  I\u2019m well aware of my role. I love that kid I know her favourite colours, I listen to every story about her dreams after sleeping, I listen to the stories about school and the kids being mean to her. I am with her more than anyone else when she is at her father\u2019s. I love her and I know she loves me, she does tell me it. But I also know being a kid doesn\u2019t make it okay to destroy someone\u2019s property or hurt an animal. Our relationship isn\u2019t all bad but I know she has some issues, I 1000% believe she needs more support than she is getting. She went from never having to share her father for years to sharing him and she struggles with it because she is 6. But that doesn\u2019t mean the way she handles it is okay. Doesn\u2019t mean I should be the only one dealing with it, and I am. Her dad works a lot. They have a special bond, he is her best friend and it has been since they moved in that the issues started. We are now together 24/7 except her time at her moms (which she has problems there) and when she is at school. She comes home and it\u2019s just me and her. I can love her and hate the way she expresses it. And I can want my fianc\u00e9 to step up and take care of his child for 2-3 weeks while I heal from bringing his other one into the world and figure out my footing because it\u2019s new. It\u2019s called a partnership. I love that kid but when as a step parent your voice matters the least and the actual parents don\u2019t get alone well enough to agree to work together for the child the situation sucks. My step daughter needs support and I can\u2019t be the only one providing it. I can\u2019t give her that support she needs when I\u2019m lost trying to figure out everything else.  I never said she was a bad kid. I never said I didn\u2019t love her.

I want everyone to be taken care of and make sure they are getting what they need.\n\nI was hoping camp and time at daddy\u2019s work would make the transition easier. He doesn\u2019t understand my fear and doing something wrong and he doesn\u2019t see how I can mess it up or get over stressed. I feel like she would enjoy the extra time with dad and she loves his coworkers and their kids. She loves to talk and it would be a big distraction. And the camp is dance camp and she is so excited. I don\u2019t want to overwhelm her with the baby and she will be bored with me. It\u2019s not fair on any of us", "Yeah, the reason he says it was easy is because he did not do any real parenting. If he did the step daughter would not have these behaviour problems. His ex i saying he is amazing is because if she says how shit he really was then you will have more reason to not take the daughter and she will need to have her daughter with her all summer, and that is exactly what she wants to avoid. \n\nAnd all three of you need to face the reality of SD hurting the baby. She will be extremely jealous of the baby, she is to young to fully handle her emotions, she lies and acts out violently (by destroying your stuff) and she does not understand consequences of her actions. It is so easy for her to loose her temper and hurt the baby when she does not get what she wants and the baby is the reason why.", "I found newborn phase the hardest. I\u2019m sorry, he sounds like an unsupportive idiot. Are you sure you should be with him?", "Please do it for the safety of the child. She might not outright hurt the child but what will she mess with?  Will she mess with formula?  put something into the baby soap or wipes that will irritate the babies skin?

Get out of the house now until she is under control for your safety and that of your daughter.", "\"She has her the majority of the time even though the dad could have her at his works child care place and see her throughout his work shift\u2026\"\n\nSo.... you think it is a great idea to slap a kid in daycare just because the biological dad has that option?  You are kind of side stepping the question.  Is that acceptable? Sure.  Is the OP an AH for forcing that option.... also, yes.", "It sounds counter intuitive but a child that you care for, who tells you she loves you and also lashes out trusts you.  She feels secure enough to melt down in your presence and take her frustrations out on you.  It's also a test to see if you'll still be there for her. \n\nSounds like there would be a lot of benefits to her going to work with Dad.  Also sounds like there are going to be a lot of growing pains for all of you in the next year.  \n\nI think you have to decide if you want to have a family with your boyfriend and his daughter or go your own way because if you stay with your boyfriend, you have to commit to this kid.\n\nNTA.", "Wait, they moved in when y\u2019all had only been together 4 months?\n\nDid you taking primary caretaker role of SD happen around that same time? \n\nBecause the speed combined with how reluctant your fianc\u00e9 is to take her to his work\u2019s daycare is, it sounds like your fianc\u00e9 wants a nanny.", "Thank you I really appreciate it. I think she seriously needs help and I can\u2019t provide it all. I think she had some of the issues before me from what I heard, it\u2019s just much bigger now. My fiance struggles with the idea of therapy (I already go) and he knows his ex won\u2019t support it. She can be a great kid, she really can but this stuff happens often and it\u2019s unpredictable. The other day she hit and bit her father for telling her no and sticking to it. We don\u2019t know what will happen and that first little bit I don\u2019t want to be outnumbered. I want to get into the swing of things before I have both of them so I can deal with everything properly and feel secure.", "Thank you! \nIt\u2019s okay I\u2019m just glad you were honest and I realize my original post might have been not worded the best. Only 3000 doesn\u2019t feel like enough and it\u2019s hard to summarize. I just want to do right by both of the kids and I don\u2019t know how to do it but I was hoping each of us taking one would be like team work but also each child with the one who can meet their needs. And honestly maybe extra time with dad is what she needs to help with her lashing out", "I 100% get what you are saying, but it\u2019s not just daycare. It\u2019s where she gets to see daddy continuously throughout the day and I know she misses him. It guarantees them more time together which has been an issue for her and I believe is a big part of the reason she is acting out.  I have her 24/7 when she is here, I asked her dad for a few weeks of him picking up his own slack that I normally do so I can heal and figure things out for the baby. It\u2019s a few hours a day 5 days a week for 2 or 3 weeks which one of those weeks I paid and out her in camp, where she gets an option to play with her friends or if at the play place at his work see him, have snacks and meals with him and stuff too while also other kids being there. Sounds like a lot more fun than being at home with me and the baby honestly", "From OPs comments the SD lashes out at her not the dad. She\u2019s getting something out of antagonizing Op that she doesn\u2019t get from her parents. Whether it be attention or a cry for help we don\u2019t know. We only have OPs side to go off from. \nAs for not dealing with SD, OP said she pushed her and lied about being hurt by her. Of course she doesn\u2019t want to be around that behaviour at the end of her pregnancy and during the first weeks of motherhood. That\u2019s just common sense to avoid stress and potential harm to an infant who can\u2019t protect themselves. And the girl isn\u2019t the problem, she has a problem. The parents are refusing to send the girl to therapy or get her help. What exactly do you want OP to do with an increasingly aggressive child who won\u2019t listen to her and bio parents who won\u2019t step in. She either has to leave or the daughter needs to leave until OP can handle a baby and a troubled child. Her child should be her only priority at the moment because SDs behaviour should be the father\u2019s priority.", "I just wish I knew how to help her.

Realistically, their needs tend to be pretty basic when they\u2019re little; they mostly just want food, diaper changes, and to be held. I highly recommend getting a baby carrier, like the baby slings or a baby bjorn, because it gives you the opportunity to comfort your child by keeping them close while also freeing up your hands. The baby carrier was a life saver for me when my first was itty bitty. Like, you will be tired because babies have to eat every 2 hours, but outside of that it\u2019s typically pretty straightforward. Oh, also, those vibrating bouncy chairs they make for little babies are absolutely worth the money. Everyone I\u2019ve known who has used them has said they calmed their little ones down when nothing else would work.\n\nAnd when it comes to childbirth, there\u2019s only so much you can prepare for, but trying to keep your stress levels as low as possible during pregnancy and labor put you in a better position to have a smooth labor and delivery. There\u2019s a highly recommended breathing technique that essentially hacks your body into de stressing where you breath in through your nose for a count of 4 and exhale through your mouth for a count of 6. It really does help a lot. Also, if this is your thing, a lot of hospitals and birth centers work with doulas now and they can be a terrific help for reducing stress. \n\nBut you seem like someone who very genuinely cares and wants what\u2019s best for your baby and your SD, so you probably won\u2019t screw up. You\u2019ll do the best you can and chances are in your favor that the best you can do will absolutely be enough. Pregnancy is a nightmare of hormones and worry, but you\u2019ll get through this and everything will be okay. I would definitely also recommend pointing out to your SO that you should plan on SD being in daycare for at least a couple weeks to allow for your body to heal post-partum. It\u2019s a super reasonable request. Maybe it doesn\u2019t have to be the whole summer. Maybe you\u2019ll recover super fast and will be up for anything almost immediately and will be down to watch SD sooner than expected. But I\u2019m always one to ere on the side of caution and to have reasonable expectations about things like this, so having a plan in place for daycare would be prudent. \n\nGood luck with the rest of your pregnancy and with your family!!!
