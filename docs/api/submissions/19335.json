If this was your own daughter, would you have been reluctant to look after her? This is going to be a problem for the rest of your lives, because she will always feel excluded.

And at 6, you don't exactly have the life experience to work through it calmly. \n\nWe also don't know the circumstances around the breakup between the little girl's parents, or how long it has been.

If possible get her into therapy. Her dad should also be spending extra time with her right now as it's a major transition to bring another child into the arrangement. Are you expected to care for her solo right now or are you saying you just don't want to have her at your house while you're pregnant? I think it's reasonable for him to provide primary care for her, but it's not ok to ask that he ditch her while you're pregnant. It's important to realize this child is going to be in your life forever as you are giving birth to her sibling. She's lashing out because of the baby.

I get upset don\u2019t get me wrong but I don\u2019t take it out on her, I leave the room to calm down.  I\u2019ve spent the last 11 months of us living together trying to make her feel secure in the situation and I feel like nothing I\u2019m doing is helping.

I understand his wants to do the best he can for his daughter because when she is at her mom\u2019s she doesn\u2019t get all the attention she wants and she is kind of absent despite it being her time, but I think he is too focused on making it positive when he has her he overcompensates and excuses things.", "Her parents haven\u2019t been together in 3 years and we\u2019re never married.

We tried to make it easier, he has designated time before bed to spend with her and only her, etc (my idea and I pushed for it) it\u2019s not long because he gets off later than we would like but it\u2019s something. Ever since I met her she didn\u2019t seem to like the word no, I have a feeling they didn\u2019t say it much. They moved into my place 11 months ago and she lashes out every time it\u2019s said. And the lashing out is usually on my things (most are from my dad who died 5 years ago). She knows I love her, she tells me she loves me all the time.

Her and I can get along fine, we play together and I take her out places and she says she loves me. The problem is it doesn\u2019t last.

Why is that the norm to attack a pregnant woman about to give birth in 6 weeks just because she wants alone time with her new baby to bond without the worry her step daughter is gonna lie again and accuse her of hurting her.?! If op was a man and his step daughter cried foul and said he hurt her he would be in jail but since it\u2019s a women and she knew he had a daughter when she met him she just has to shut up and take being the main care giver to a child who lashes out at her.

It\u2019s not me not wanting a relationship with her, it\u2019s me wanting a break from being the one who constantly gets the worst of it while I give birth and figure out being a first time bio mom.", "Yeah. It sucks that now the new baby could potentially end up as a child of divorce... but, man. I don't know what to tell you. You are either cut out to be stepmom to a difficult kiddo or you aren't. I am not judging you. I will be the first person to say HELL NO I would not be a stepmom. I simply know myself and it's not in me.", "That's completely fair.  Add in a picnic at lunch or after work for just the two of them or a stop for ice cream and make it a thing for them to share while you get a couple of months with baby during the day.  Sounds fair.", "Stepmoms are always evil on this honey! It\u2019s ok to bond with your baby without having to deal with a child who acts out. Your doing your best and that\u2019s all anyone can ask. Good luck and congrats."]}
