He took some food off her plate to try a bite and she responded by shaking her finger and saying \"You need to ask!\" He said \"I'm sorry, you're right, I should ask,\" and then a few minutes later, reached over to my place setting and took some of my food without asking.   \n\n\nI didn't think it was a great example for our daughter considering it happened moments earlier so I said \"You didn't ask. You just did the same thing to \\[daughter\\].\" He said, \"I assumed you were done eating.\" and I said \"You assumed. But just ask me.\" so he handed it back to me, said \"Can I have some of your garlic bread?\" and I shared. Very calm, normal exchange.  \n\n\nBecause this was a non-issue and I was not upset at the situation, we tried to use it in marriage counseling as an example of how to communicate in certain situations, mainly, when I say something hurt me and my spouse wants to explain how he experienced the event instead of apologizing.   \n\n\nIt became an issue when he only wanted to give HIS side of the food story in counseling. Later that day, I asked him calmly again, if he would like to share his side to see if it changes my perspective. I said \"I can't argue with your experience since we both agree on what happened\" - and to my surprise he indicated we did not agree. He told me he took the garlic bread from my place because he \"got it for both of us.\"   \n\n\nI knew this was nonsense as I order from this restaurant frequently and know how much garlic bread comes with the dish. I got insanely angry, because we argue **constantly** about how things happen, so I stormed off. Later, he came to me and said \"I'm sorry, I thought the garlic bread was mine and I was wrong.\"   \n\n\nSo by this point, I'd been told that he got garlic bread for us both, and then that he thought the bread was his. I felt crazy as I usually do when these conversations happen with him, so I thought to check the nanny cam to see what really happened.   \n\n\nHe handed me my food saying \"and there's garlic bread on top for you\" and then later, when I called him out for taking it from my place, he didn't say \"This bread is mine?\" or \"I got this to share,\" he said \"Okay. Can I have some of your garlic bread?\"   \n\n\nI took these clips from our nanny cam and sent them to him, asking why he would lie about something so small and turn it into a massive thing. He immediately got mad and said \"I can't believe you would do something as ridiculous as checking the camera. You're so out of line.\" and stormed off.   \n\n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole/out of line for using our nanny cam to call my spouse out for lying?", "created_utc": 1684523377, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13m4s10/aita_for_checking_our_nanny_cam_footage_to_prove/", "score": 5350, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not an ex but with my abuser I went through years of making excuses for the vile things she did to me. I nearly died on multiple occasions, one of which I hate a date for! I was so desperate for love I was able to push past all of it to make it work\n\nThen one day I, 7/8 months pregnant with my daughter, had a minor emergency; my cat's face was puffing up and we didn't know the cause. I had an \"emergency joint account\" with her, it was previously my childhood account she convinced me to keep so if I ever needed money in an emergency she could get it to me ASAP. Something important to note here though is whenever I did a job for her or she wanted to gift me money she would always use this account to give it to me; rather than the cash I always requested. I always requested cash because she would monitor my purchases like a hawk. It didn't matter that I \"knew\" I just got paid 200 dollars for a cake I did, and decided to treat myself to a candy bar. I'd get a text within a few minutes asking why I used the card. (Because I want to use my hard earned money??) This led to me rarely using the card as I couldn't track the money myself and hated always having her monitor me or needing to involve her in even the tiniest of purchases. In any case, I texted her asking if she could let me know exactly how much was in the account. I knew it had to be around 150-200. Even if I was dead wrong she had texted me a few weeks before telling me she had gifted me 50 dollars so I KNEW that much was there as I hadn't used the card in that time.\n\nNo answer. I call. No answer. I text and call again multiple times. No answer. I call my sister worried that I'm blowing my abusers phone up at work. Nope my abuser is apparently playing a game on her phone..... So why isn't she picking up my calls? Surely when I'm calling multiple times it looks like an emergency right? \n\nFast forward my cat is fine but as I'm taking him home I see the bank my card is from and decide to check the card at the ATM. ..... $10.41.\n\nWHAT. \n\nThat was the moment I started to shut down. Something was wrong. Something was so fucking wrong with this situation. I called my then boyfriend, now husband and explained what happened. We agreed to go into the bank on Monday to see for sure if the situation is what I was thinking. No word from my abuser. Not a peep. \n\nUntil Monday, then I got a text in the afternoon claiming there was some glitch and she had to call and get it fixed. \n\nShe said there was $163 and change. A number I would've expected. A number I would've swallowed and gone on my merry way a few days prior. Meh. Sounds about right. Only now it didn't. We go to the bank. What is this glitch? What's going on? Show me the transaction records. \n\nTransfer after transfer from my account to hers and back. Sometimes she took 20 and paid back 10. Other times she took 15 but put back 20. No rhyme or reason to it. No way to really see if she always put back what she took. I didn't have a hope in hell of figuring out what was earned, gifted, stolen etc. Legally none of it was \"stolen\" as it's a joint account she was well within her rights to do what she did. But I knew two things in that moment. 1) Never once did she ask permission to take this money. 2) She lied. On the day I checked the ATM? The day I was calling all morning leaving text after text? Turns out about an hour or so before I checked the ATM she had transferred 10 dollars into my account. Meaning I was actually down to .41c. *less than a dollar* a fucking *candy bar* would've overdrafted me (makes me wonder how many times I already overdrafted on a candy bar before; would explain why she was so hell bent on monitoring my account despite me \"knowing\" I'd just been paid 200+ a few days prior). \n\nBut yeah. My heart went ice cold on her. I was pregnant with my first child and she took money from me. More specifically she *lied* about it. If she had just asked for the money I would've bent over backwards to give it to her. Had she just admitted she took it, for any number of reasons or no reason at all even, I would've accepted it and buried my head back in the sand. But that lie? Fuck. I couldn't do it. I couldn't look past it. All that grace id given her finally burst the bubble on a lie.\n\nAnd boy howdy did I get hell for it. On and on my sister and family went telling me it was just a misunderstanding. Was I really cutting my abuser off and not letting her be grandma over what, *'a few dollars?!'*\n\nF it. Nope. She could've given me every penny, nickel, and dime back polished and in prime condition; maybe for all I know she had. Like I said the transaction records were impossible to track given how much trust I had given her. I wouldn't know. But what I did know is she lied. She lied and either thought I was dumb enough to buy it or a good enough door mat to not fight it. For years now I've been the awful daughter who cut contact over a \"misunderstanding\", \"a few dollars\", or my favorite \"no reason at all, I think her boyfriend is abusing her\" (projection much?) Is what it is. But it's funny looking back just how much I was willing to suffer in the name of love until that one tiny detail just broke the camels back for me.

I don't exactly follow \"love language\" stuff, but it takes some level of trust and vulnerability for you to share a passion of yours with someone. \n\nMaybe a single tomato plant isn't a whole entire passionate topic, but I can imagine feeling a little more lonely if I asked someone I loved to look at a cool plant and I was ignored.", "I know! I was thinking for once a time when the term can be applied aptly. I knew I wouldn\u2019t have to scroll far to find it either", "My ex spent over $500 for his lawyer to write me a letter and follow up in court over four plates and a cake plate. \n\nThe plates were plastic kids plates from the dollar section at target and the cake plate was $9.99 from Ross. He was willing to spend $500 to be right. \n\nI told the lawyer the plates were flaking and unsafe to use so I threw them away (true) and the cake plate broke (not true but I can be petty too) and said I would happily repay the $9.99. \n\nThese items had zero emotional or special attachment to him and he didn't realize they were \"missing\" for over six months. I have no idea what his deal was.", "I read the Iranian yoghurt post every so often and it gets me every time...you're in for a treat reading it for the first time", "My best friend's mom is like this. She's ruined so many lives.", "My ex tried to give away all of the cool stuff I had received as gifts to his mom when we separated. She wanted my custom curtains (for her new lake house), my 6 quart kitchen aid mixer and the wine fridge, all of which were gifts. He was so petty he said the wall-hung jewelry box he had bought for me the year prior was \u201carchitectural.\u201d Please, loser, just keep that BS to trap in a new wife. \n\nNTA. It sounds like he has no respect for you or your daughter. That the bigger issue.", "Side story\u2026 I worked at a progressive tech company in California that was very accepting of all people and lifestyles. So much so that even before gay marriage was legal, they allowed employees to enroll their same sex domestic partners in our really awesome health insurance plan which our gay and lesbian coworkers loved!\n\nUntil gay marriage became legal\u2026 then the policy changed to only allow spouses on the health insurance. And while some of our gay and lesbian coworkers got married when they were able, many more did not, and had no intention to. That was a bit of a bummer situation.", "> Was your father a lost time traveller? Haven't women been like near enough half the US Labour force since like the 60s or some shit? \n\nI know it feels like that, but as a child of the 80s it really wasn\u2019t. Things still aren\u2019t quite equal for men and women in the workplace, but it was much worse then. Women who wanted to work were seen as taking away jobs that could have gone to a man, to support a family. They were seen as greedy, and generally discounted. Sexual harassment in the workplace was very, very common. \n\nIt\u2019s a lot better now, but we still have some ways to go.", "No, he\u2019s right.", "Luckily my mother is no longer gorgeous. It's has slowed her role and forced her to change her game.

No one argued about it. It went with me when I moved out. Kept it through several moves.\n\nAnd during the start of the worst part of my life, I lost my house, and friends helped me pack up, and things got stored in various places while I was homeless.\n\nAnd I never found my silverware. So that fork was gone.\n\nOh. And the jar opener. Metal. Two different size segments, and between that and fact that it was hinged, I could open anything. Even with my little hands. Such a simple and practical design.\n\nI never saw that again either. I've never found it, or one like it, again. All the ones I've found are plastic, and a different design.
