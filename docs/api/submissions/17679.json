He took some food off her plate to try a bite and she responded by shaking her finger and saying \"You need to ask!\" He said \"I'm sorry, you're right, I should ask,\" and then a few minutes later, reached over to my place setting and took some of my food without asking.   \n\n\nI didn't think it was a great example for our daughter considering it happened moments earlier so I said \"You didn't ask. You just did the same thing to \\[daughter\\].\" He said, \"I assumed you were done eating.\" and I said \"You assumed. But just ask me.\" so he handed it back to me, said \"Can I have some of your garlic bread?\" and I shared. Very calm, normal exchange.  \n\n\nBecause this was a non-issue and I was not upset at the situation, we tried to use it in marriage counseling as an example of how to communicate in certain situations, mainly, when I say something hurt me and my spouse wants to explain how he experienced the event instead of apologizing.   \n\n\nIt became an issue when he only wanted to give HIS side of the food story in counseling. Later that day, I asked him calmly again, if he would like to share his side to see if it changes my perspective. I said \"I can't argue with your experience since we both agree on what happened\" - and to my surprise he indicated we did not agree. He told me he took the garlic bread from my place because he \"got it for both of us.\"   \n\n\nI knew this was nonsense as I order from this restaurant frequently and know how much garlic bread comes with the dish. I got insanely angry, because we argue **constantly** about how things happen, so I stormed off. Later, he came to me and said \"I'm sorry, I thought the garlic bread was mine and I was wrong.\"   \n\n\nSo by this point, I'd been told that he got garlic bread for us both, and then that he thought the bread was his. I felt crazy as I usually do when these conversations happen with him, so I thought to check the nanny cam to see what really happened.   \n\n\nHe handed me my food saying \"and there's garlic bread on top for you\" and then later, when I called him out for taking it from my place, he didn't say \"This bread is mine?\" or \"I got this to share,\" he said \"Okay. Can I have some of your garlic bread?\"   \n\n\nI took these clips from our nanny cam and sent them to him, asking why he would lie about something so small and turn it into a massive thing. He immediately got mad and said \"I can't believe you would do something as ridiculous as checking the camera. You're so out of line.\" and stormed off.   \n\n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole/out of line for using our nanny cam to call my spouse out for lying?", "created_utc": 1684523377, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13m4s10/aita_for_checking_our_nanny_cam_footage_to_prove/", "score": 818, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Unless he went into \u201cpoor me\u201d mode when he would bemoan the fact that \u201che could bet do anything right.\u201d With lots of sighing and hand wringing.", "For sure it's overused, but yeah this guy is clearly trying to rewrite what happened to make OP doubt herself.", "Yeah, I knew that last thing about remembering but didn't extrapolate to that level.\n\nIt's weird because my personal experiences with my person who edit their memories (I like that terminology) is like I have an idea. We implement the idea. Later, he tells the story of how this came about and it was his idea. I'm sure it was mine but I can't prove it. But I can also tell he's not lying. He believes it's true.", "And then when they are confronted with evidence showing they were wrong, they blow up or call the other person petty.", "I guess the next step is getting him to start providing proof when he seems overconfident.\n\n>He's mad because he was proven wrong\n\nI don't understand how this man is mad instead of apologetic when he is wrong.", "you go on to a thread with a pretty clear example of abuse, and say your partner acts the same way, and then get mad when someone else asks why you put up with it. interesting.", "I don't see a single concerning behavior or a single explanation as to why it's concerning.", "I have an ex who insisted on getting half a jar of pink peppercorns because they had been part of his Xmas hamper. Whatever dude!", "NTA. You aren't out of line.", ">In 2007 my father made a comment at the dinner table about how gay marriage would destroy America because \u201cthe tax code isn\u2019t set up for dual-income households\u201d\n\nWas your father a lost time traveller? Haven't women been like near enough half the US Labour force since like the 60s or some shit? WW1 and 2 had ramifications on women in the working world for basically every country that was a participant in them - on account of the fact that said countries had no men in the factories or fields because they shipped them halfway across the world to fight a war...\n\nAnd not only that but like...gay people in general are a small minority, gay people who are going to get married are even slimmer still (the most recent stats indicate that late millennial/gen Z are on trend to put marriage outside of religious values on life support...gen alphas probably gonna kill it in the \"Western world\"), the tax break deficit would probably be balanced out by some ultra niche tax that like...7 US corporations have to pay every half decade for some incredibly arbitrary reason based on some 2 century law wrote by a sheriff under the influence of moonshine and opiates...", "Oh, I love the flash as a character. I find speedsters in general too be very interesting characters because of how OP they are. Therefore writers have to come up with interesting plot development or character flaws that 'weaken' their abilities. I could write a dissertation about Flashpoint alone.\n\nThat's what made it all the more ridiculous. I'm a huge DC nerd and the flash is one of my favorites. That's why I HATED the damn show. It didn't confuse me. It was lazily written and poorly acted. I saw it as trash television.\n\nThat's like saying the reason I don't like Twilight is because I don't understand the concept 'turning'. No Becky. It's because it is produced to satisfy the lowest common denominator and the way they depict vampires is stupid. Now go drink your Starbucks. I'll be playing Vampires: The Masquerade.\n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk.", "That sounds way cooler. I am nicking that and popularising it", "I suppose it isn't impossible for someone to gaslight themselves unknowingly. Memory is hardly immutable and there are plenty of ways a brain can have issues whether physical damage or emotional damage or just bad wiring to begin with.", "Would it be their \"fault\" then, if they even aren't aware of what they are doing? I know it happens with people who are pathological liars, they lie without even knowing they lie, they just simply do.\n\nAnd if that's the case, shouldn't we (humanity) be a bit more concerned about finding out how to treat it? Because I do doubt gaslighting is something you always intentionally do.", "Now THAT'S where narcissistic disorder, or whatever the technical term is, comes in to play. Or it could just be a matter of pride. He's probably mad because either A) he had an agenda or B) it undermines his ego somehow.\n\nPersonally, my BF and I will argue because we're both just stubborn people and neither of us wants to back down.

I have a serious chronic illness and yet the second I feel okay for a minute I\u2019m hit with a barrage of thoughts about how I was never really sick to begin with, I\u2019m a lazy bum who doesn\u2019t want to work, the doctor was right you\u2019re crazy, etc.\n\nETA: also important to note that I have ocd which is lovingly referred to as \u201cthe doubt disease.\u201d If something exists even in the abstract, someone with ocd can doubt it!", "More concerned, no. Equally concerned, yes. You can\u2019t know that you\u2019re a manipulator until you\u2019ve been manipulative, and it\u2019s all of our responsibilities to perpetually try to be better to the people around us, so it matters very deeply that she is being gaslit by someone who knows on some level that he is manipulating her.\n\nI find the concept of fault and punishment to be completely reductive in like 98% of interpersonal situations, and an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Learning, reinforcing, or unlearning behaviors begins when a person is born and doesn\u2019t stop until they die.\n\nETA: it\u2019s also never emotionally intelligent to base judgement of outcome on intention", "Knowing you are twisting things so that you win is enough. Whether or not you think carefully about the harm it can do, you should know that 'changing it so I win' is wrong.

I don\u2019t think it was something he consciously recognized. It was like he was gaslighting himself\u2014 he was drinking the bullshit koolaid before trying to get me to as well. Like the PR side of his brain actively altered his memory of what happened. EXTREMELY frustrating to deal with. I have ADHD related memory issues and that meant my version of events never had the slightest bit of credibility to him. Fuck I am so glad not to deal with that anymore after like, 12 years of that shit.", "If I can jump in here, as I've done a lot of studying on the psychology of lies: there's no affliction that would render a person incapable of knowing they're lying. Even in cases of compulsive or pathological lying, the individual comprehends they're telling a lie. And from my understanding of this subject, they *also* know *why* they're lying - to avoid punishment, repercussions; to attain admiration - although they might not understand why they're like that.\n\nTldr: lying is intentional, the person lying knows they're lying, and they expect something from it (avoid punishment or gain a reward). If there's a history or pattern of lying, it might be symptomatic of a disorder and they would need an experienced analyst or therapist to treat it.", "I mean, I save my nerd boners for Batman and Spiderman, but I am sometimes willing to, I dunno, finger a speedsters butthole.", "*HUGS*", "I feel this in my soul as someone else with chronic illness who also grew up in an abusive environment. I always feel like I can\u2019t ever _quite_ trust my brain. Wonderful, ain\u2019t it?", "Just to clarify, I ment more concerned in general than we are now about treatment - Which I believe is currently zero percent.\n\nLet's say a manipulator manipulates, but without knowing it for whatever reason. \nWould the unbeknownst manipulator be the complete bad guy or would the individual also have somewhat of a victim role?", "\"Should know\", yes if you're a functioning individual - but what if the individual in fact has some form of disorder or PTSD that makes them unable to even fathom thinking like that?", "I personally just don\u2019t see these situations as bad guys and victims, because I myself am an advocate for a society where the concepts of crime and punishment are re-tooled. \n\nI view actions and consequences in a very simple way: we perform actions that have negative consequences every day, ranging from harmful only to the self, to being potentially harmful to generations after you. \n\nIt\u2019s a massive spectrum of cause and effect that is, in my uneducated opinion, the basis of everything. \n\nI don\u2019t feel bad for him that he\u2019s finding out that he\u2019s a manipulator, this is just something that is happening in his life. It as a single detail says nothing about him as a person. He can now choose to either improve upon this realization, or choose to ignore it and continue to be harmful to himself and everyone around him.\n\nI don\u2019t pity her for being manipulated. This is just something that is happening to her, and says nothing about her as a person. It is a temporary horror, and she is not at fault. The human mind is malleable, fallible, and there is not a conscious soul alive who can\u2019t be fucked with. Not one! \n\nSo then in my view, the best outcome is for both people to learn from this big time. For her that will likely look very different than it looks for him. For her it\u2019s about keeping herself and her children mentally, emotionally, and physically safe whatever she has to do. For him, he is the one who needs to actually actively figure out why he\u2019s doing this and to acquire the tools to stop it. \n\nI can have empathy for him, but there is a clear priority on well-being when it comes to these situations, and it\u2019s not in favor of the person manipulating."]}
