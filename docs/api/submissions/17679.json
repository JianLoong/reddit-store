He took some food off her plate to try a bite and she responded by shaking her finger and saying \"You need to ask!\" He said \"I'm sorry, you're right, I should ask,\" and then a few minutes later, reached over to my place setting and took some of my food without asking.   \n\n\nI didn't think it was a great example for our daughter considering it happened moments earlier so I said \"You didn't ask. You just did the same thing to \\[daughter\\].\" He said, \"I assumed you were done eating.\" and I said \"You assumed. But just ask me.\" so he handed it back to me, said \"Can I have some of your garlic bread?\" and I shared. Very calm, normal exchange.  \n\n\nBecause this was a non-issue and I was not upset at the situation, we tried to use it in marriage counseling as an example of how to communicate in certain situations, mainly, when I say something hurt me and my spouse wants to explain how he experienced the event instead of apologizing.   \n\n\nIt became an issue when he only wanted to give HIS side of the food story in counseling. Later that day, I asked him calmly again, if he would like to share his side to see if it changes my perspective. I said \"I can't argue with your experience since we both agree on what happened\" - and to my surprise he indicated we did not agree. He told me he took the garlic bread from my place because he \"got it for both of us.\"   \n\n\nI knew this was nonsense as I order from this restaurant frequently and know how much garlic bread comes with the dish. I got insanely angry, because we argue **constantly** about how things happen, so I stormed off. Later, he came to me and said \"I'm sorry, I thought the garlic bread was mine and I was wrong.\"   \n\n\nSo by this point, I'd been told that he got garlic bread for us both, and then that he thought the bread was his. I felt crazy as I usually do when these conversations happen with him, so I thought to check the nanny cam to see what really happened.   \n\n\nHe handed me my food saying \"and there's garlic bread on top for you\" and then later, when I called him out for taking it from my place, he didn't say \"This bread is mine?\" or \"I got this to share,\" he said \"Okay. Can I have some of your garlic bread?\"   \n\n\nI took these clips from our nanny cam and sent them to him, asking why he would lie about something so small and turn it into a massive thing. He immediately got mad and said \"I can't believe you would do something as ridiculous as checking the camera. You're so out of line.\" and stormed off.   \n\n\nSo reddit, am I the asshole/out of line for using our nanny cam to call my spouse out for lying?", "created_utc": 1684523377, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13m4s10/aita_for_checking_our_nanny_cam_footage_to_prove/", "score": 2224, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm a fan of B movies and dumpster fires that I can MST3K.  It was bad in all the right ways for me to enjoy it", "How do you feel about \"Young Justice?\" I love that there's four generations of the Flash and the story arcs that they gave them", "I couldn't remember, but you're [right](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/06/happily-ever-after/372573/).  The Gottman Institute has a lot of good information, too.  \n\nPaying attention to bids and rooting out any sources of contempt or resentment has done wonders to enhance our relationship.", "You can absolutely do therapy by yourself. That's the primary way therapy works. Even if one person in a couple learns healthy communication skills and boundaries, a relationship worth keeping will improve.\n\nAnd it sounds like therapy worked exactly correctly. The problem wasn't that he didn't do therapy, it was that he persistently blamed your for his failures even in therapy.", "So glad I left. I was young, he was young, I just chalked it up to being immature. It took me way too long to leave because I was also very messed up at the time, but never again. Finished off the relationship with him telling me even though I was leaving him, he'd work on himself and stop lying, proceeded to lie to everyone and say he dumped me and made up a bunch of other crap. It was so insane, he was lie about anything and everything, it was unbelievable to have someone just lie so brazenly all the time about things that didn't matter.", "That sounds like a sad victory.   \nBless you.", ">It also presupposes that lesbians just\u2026 don\u2019t pay taxes?\n\n\"All lesbians arrested, tax evasion down by 42069% overnight\"\n\n>Because they couldn\u2019t possibly make an income without a man?\n\nFactual. All lesbians have a life cycle of 18 and 3 months...till 18 they're like the rest of us, then they eat coochie and starve to death over 3 months time because lesbian brains cannot process the word \"job\" or \"work\". Any \"lesbian\" claiming to be older than 18 and 3 months old is a paid actor funded by big Gay", "I don't understand this comment.\n\nWouldn't the supposed issues of gay marriage apply equally to gay people of both genders?\n\nDoes gay just mean gay men nowadays?", "I don't remember who that poster was but it was so weird that your situation was so similar.   \n\n\nI *do* remember that that thread evolved into a \"get your dad checked out by a neurosurgeon\" so, in light of that, I hope your dad's okay.", "Im kinda jealous.", "I've actually never watched it. I'll have to check it out.", "Yeah, but you can't do couples counseling by yourself, and you can't really do it if only one person is committed to working.\n\n...though, I suppose, it depends on what you mean by doing it. It was useful to have the validation, and to see that he couldn't manage to present even a veneer of doing the work even when there was someone else keeping track. It was super frustrating that he would rant and rave about how much he wanted to work things out, and yet wouldn't do crap.", "I'm sorry to put up such a useless, overused comment in response, but that was so goddamn hilarious. Thank you for this comment \ud83d\ude02", "This was the best thing I read in so long.", "Lol I kind of want to read that post but no that was not me. My dad is, I believe, ok, although shortly after the divorce he decided to get a new life and moved across state, cut off everyone he knew save for a few texts a year with one of my siblings, and switched careers (cannot stress enough that he is currently an accountant).\n\nBut I hear his current wife really adores him and their cats are cool so idk?", "The goal of couples therapy isn't to stay together forever. It's for the individuals involved to be in a healthy relationship. It's very much a \"shit or get off the pot\" kind of deal. If only one person is committed enough to having a healthy relationship that they put in the effort, then the success of couples therapy is for them to move on."]}
