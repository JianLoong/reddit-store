You did her a favor and she returned your kindness with stupidity wrapped in religious guff.  Hopefully everyone else around you has the good sense to tell her to stop being an idiot.", "NTA\n\nI don't know how to say this politely, but is she okay? Mentally, I mean.  \n'Cause that sounds like a really extreme reaction.  \nMy point is, is her religiosity a positive thing in her life or is it masking or feeding mental health issues?", "I wish I had thought of demons last time someone wanted to borrow my car. Where can you buy car demons?", "LMAO what a major flex on your part. Its funny, but I also get why she's mad. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe needs to chill a bit. NTA", "NTA I think the more people who submit to the demon lords the better. My car got infested and I'm much happier now that I don't have my own thoughts cluttering up my head. Give in to the demon car :)", "religious people will ruin anything because of their fairytale \ud83d\ude44 NTA", "How do you get this font?", "I dunno, a double negative makes a positive. Not real creatures and a not real organization (anime based). \n\nSeriously, NTA.", "Her whole belief system is based on make-believe stories, so, I assume they're equally real to her?", "As opposed to real demons, or?", "She is not even pious, I bet. She is using religion to fulfill a need to pick fights.", "I'm fairly sure even devout Catholics do not literally expect Jesus to take the wheel if your demon riddled borrowed car goes Maximum Overdrive on you.", "Aren't all religions made up cults?", "You'd think so, but they're so \\*\\*\\*\\*ing into their sky daddy death cult.", "Lmao I was so tempted to say something like that in response, luckily I held back", "You guessed right!", "From the description it sounds like Jashinism from Naruto.", "Tbh I didn\u2019t even think about that, as I said the symbol itself is very tame, unless you\u2019re familiar with the anime canon and hate the character who used it or idk, are a geometry hater, the chances of being offended by it are very low.", "You guessed right, we actually had a conversation about HP and she said she wouldn\u2019t want her future kids to watch it as it \u201cpromotes witchcraft\u201d.", "Gotchu homie.\n\nType anything, scroll down, and boom!\n\nhttps://lingojam.com/DiscordFonts", "No, that's a bad argument. That's like saying that journalists are the same as novelists. \n\nHer belief system is based on people a very long time ago speculating about how the world works and coming up with a theory that they - at the time, in good faith - thought they had found sufficient proof for. It's not the same thing as a fiction writer coming up with a cool idea that isn't intended to be believed. People don't believe in make-believe. The point of make-believe is that you have to suspend your disbelief because it's such a satisfying idea, but it's not something you actually get confused with reality.", "Unnecessarily aggressive", "Should tell her that you are sending thoughts and prayers.", "Considering the hold religion has on politics and how it can literally dictate which laws are put in place (no matter how stupid or bigoted), then yes it certainly makes fools of us all.", "Yup, NTA. It\u2019s a fictional religion from an anime, so you didn\u2019t necessarily lie. Your sister is an adult, and should know better than to act like an entitled child. Let her walk or take the bus, because she\u2019s such an ingrate towards you. \n\nPS, you have good taste. Hidan\u2019s my favorite from Akatsuki.", "I'm going with ESH too. OP could have told her about the keychain, which he probably knew was not acceptable. And his sister is an AH too for lashing out so hard. Even though it is a made up story you gotta remember. She's VERY religious, made up stories can be very real for her.", "I don't like to judge people generally, but I always believed that if your faith is so weak that HP will throw you into \"witchcraft\" how much faith can you really have?", "\ud835\udcea\ud835\udd2b\u040et\u02b0\ud835\udd40\uff2e\uff47", "I prefer Laplace's Demon. That guy knows all the best places.", "I guess she overreacted bc it\u2019s an evil cult, idk what set her off.\n\nI\u2019ve also got a Hidan sticker on the rear windshield saying \u201cdrive like you\u2019re immortal\u201d and surprisingly she had no problem with it, but the keychain is no no.", "Lmao", "Meh even the demons don't want *this* meat sack. Ouija board just stays on \"No\"", "And keep Chekhov's gun nearby too", "I like to joke that any demon that would make the mistake of possessing me is trapped with me not the other way around", "They'd be like: fuck this host, this shit hurts!\n\nI have severe chronic pain, autism, ADHD so they'd be SOL lol\n\nThings they'd have to put up with:\n\n-two different songs stuck in my head at once, battling for dominance or the same 30 seconds of a song stuck in my head (our head?) for weeks at a time\n\n-severe ouchies\n\n-an almost complete lack of balance\n\n-sensory issues where fleece hurts and being sticky feels like being tortured or hearing \"wrong\" sounds feels like a dentist drilling your teeth without anesthestic\n\n-intrusive impulsive thoughts where the demon would wonder why they have the urge to just jump on this rock or to see what happens if they do ... this\n\n-random inability to motivate themselves \n\nAnd many more!", "Too ADHD to destroy the world, that apocalypse is just going to continue to be procrastinated."]}
