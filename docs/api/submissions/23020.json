You can't expect her to perform duties traditionally performed by women just because she's a woman.  That's not a fair way to look at how workload should be divided.  Depending on your age, one day you guys might have kids.  If that happens, then the balance of effort will probably lean towards her because raising a kid is an endless 24/7 job, not just an 80h workweek. \n\nregardless you guys should put everything on the table and have a conversation about who does what just to reset expectations.

There simply isn't 80-90 hours of intensive labor to be done in a 2 person household, and it ain't even close. This guy is a tradesman which means he is doing a very physically demanding job that doesn't have any downtime. If you've never done that kind of work it is really impossible to understand what a beating your body takes and the level of physical exhaustion is involved. To be putting forth the same effort she would need to be cleaning multiple homes each week. That's what housecleaners do before coming home and cleaning their own homes.", "Oh, yes, geez, sorry I forgot he's Don Draper, and this is an episode of Mad Men.", "Yep. She deserves to relax after having to deal with his ass. I hope she files for divorce, takes half his crap and marries a man who appreciates her.

Totally enlightening that there are vastly different lending practices just across the border. \n\nDoes your wife feel stuck because she doesn\u2019t know what she wants to do? Was she miserable at her last job? Maybe you can make a post about what she\u2019s like, what she wants for herself, what she\u2019s good at, her education and experience, and the area you live in.

She does do those tasks but one thing she refuses to do is make my lunch... I told her today that it\u2019s her job to pack me my lunch now\n\nShe runs the house just fine, this is simply a question about who makes OP's lunches. We do not *tell* our spouses that it's their job to make us lunch.

I\u2019m a STAHM myself and it is far from doing nothing all day.. I get pissed off at both parties here. They are both immature, one just contributes more than the other. It\u2019s hard to believe that they\u2019re actual adults . They both have flaws and honestly sound like they have differing values. \n\nEven if she were studying that would be a contribution.. I wonder what her excuse is? Even doing the bare minimum of cooking is a contribution.", "I agree with the first half of your comment but where does the T come from? The middle of the word STay?

She is an able bodied young person. The only reason that any of you think that this is a perfectly reasonable choice is that she is a woman in a heteronormative relationship. Outside of this specific scenario and your sexist blinders suddenly come off. \n\nThere's no way that you would respond the same way if the story went something like...\n\n\"My husband quit his job and has stated that he has no interest in going back to work.

So much to process. You\u2019re a sexist. OP works, so does his spouse, and remember being a home maker is a 24/7 job. OP does nothing after he clocks off. His spouse?

It isn't a job at all. \n\nYou need to work on your logic skills. If there is a never ending 24/7 amount of domestic work to be done then working people do all of that too after their work day is done.
