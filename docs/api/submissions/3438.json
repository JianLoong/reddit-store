Because we're perpetually broke, I made it a staycation. My husband works remotely for an insurance company, like I do, so we both work from home, though I'm required to actually go to our company office 2 days a week.\nMy father died Thanksgiving day. We weren't very close, and had a complicated relationship. We'd made amends a few years ago, and kept in touch via phone and letters, as he lived in another state. I feel sad, especially since his death was sudden and I never got to tell him goodbye. I won't be going to his funeral, and my family on his side is ok with that.\nMy hubby offered to take bereavement time off, but I told him it's not necessary, since my father's death isn't really affecting me much, and he'd only met my father for one week about 15 years ago. However, this morning, the first day of my vacation, hubby tells me he's taken the whole week off to \" be there for me\". AITA for getting angry with him? I feel he's using my dad's death to HIS advantage, and is ruining my very needed quiet time. We've been married more then 30 years and have 2 grown kids. I have yet to have even 1 day completely alone.\nEDIT - This is not the 1st time he's done this. I've had several older family members die in the last couple of years. I didn't take time off of work since I wasn't particularly close to them, but he took the maximum bereavement time, then spent it watch TV, playing video games, and sleeping.

He said he understood and was okay with it, because I desperately needed time away from work. I get 5 weeks a year for PTO, and most of those days I spend for my doctor's appointments or doing things for others.\nHe's done this to me before. An aunt of mine died earlier this year. I didn't take any time off, but he took 3 days bereavement, and lounged around the house. Same thing with an uncle a couple years back.\nI told him the day after Thanksgiving that he didn't need to take any time off for me, because I didn't need any emotional support. He's been telling me this whole year I should go stay alone in a hotel for a few days, because he recognizes I also need a break from him, knowing full well we can't afford it. So you can see why, to me, this appears to be solely for HIM to get free paid off from HIS job and use me as an excuse.", "I think it's fine to exploit his work's policy for time off,  and even use your dead relatives if that's what it takes. But he shouldn't be lying to you about why. He should be honest with you that he's just gaming the system. Tell him if that's what he's gonna do, stay the hell away from you while you take your own time off.", "NTA- He's clearly enjoying the bereavement time.  If he really cares so much, then tell him everything you want from him to make your staycation salvageable. No electronics and just books? Quiet time hours in which you don't talk to each other? Give him a honey do list and make him take care of all of your errands?  Make him drive you to places that you enjoy?  Since he's hanging around, you mind as well use him.", "INFO: did you directly express to him you wanted the time alone? Your annoyance isn't totally unwarranted but he may be trying to be supportive and nice to you", "NAH, Nobody's the asshole  \nI think your husband is just worried about you and trying to be there for you but I also understand why him taking the week off is frustrating for you. I think you should just communicate this to him and say you really appreciate him taking the time off but it's just not what you want or need right now and that right now he can support you by giving you the space that you need", "NTA. Tell him to stop using your losses to his benefit. That's freaking weird!", "I was originally leaning towards N-A-H thinking that he was trying to be supportive but you\u2019re entitled to alone time when you want it\u2026 but with your comment that he has previously used your losses to get time off for himself when _you_ were not able or wanting to take time off changes that.\n\nYou are firmly NTA, and your husband is selfish in a very sneaky sort of way - he looks good to others, and on the surface there\u2019s nothing \u201cwrong\u201d with his actions, but in fact he\u2019s not giving you what you want or listening to what you need. He\u2019s using your misfortunes for his own benefit and stomping on your boundaries to do so - like, \u201chow dare you have free time while he has to work, all your time and attention belongs to him\u201d.", "NAH\n\nBut you need to use your grown up words to tell your husband that you need a bit of alone time.", "I feel like I will in the minority here, but I don't think he did it for his advantage. I think he is trying to show genuine support.\n\nHis thought process might be telling him to \"be there for you\" because maybe he would feel bad if he wasn't there to offer support and comfort. Maybe he would not have felt like a great partner or husband if he wasn't there for you, should you needed it.\n\nMaybe you wouldn't have needed it (or wanted it); but he might have thought it would better for him to be there and for you not need it than for him to not be there and you did need it or want it.", "You're NTA but you really need to communicate to your husband your desire to be alone over all. It's a pretty common thing for people to need others around after a death, so your husband probably worries that you're just trying not to burden him and is making himself available anyway. It MAY be that you need more alone time than the average person over all, and he hasn't realized this yet, so you're just going to have to tell him yourself", "Even if he's milking bereavement leave/pay, I'm going to say NAH. \n\nTell him to leave you alone, you just want time by yourself. \n\nIf he's minding his own business in another part of the house, well, that was the original plan anyway, yea? Him working at home, you just doing your own thing while he did his. The only difference is video games instead of working. \n\nAssuming he's on paid bereavement and not using PTO or unpaid time that will affect you in the future, I see no problem, honestly.", "Nta....he is using your family situation for his benefit and it isn't right....id at least spend 2 nights in a motel or something to get away from that bs.", "NAH as described. He's not wrong for trying to be supportive because many people do bottle up their feelings. \n\nBut you wanting alone time is also perfectly fine. I would just reiterate you'd rather be alone and then just go off doing something alone, even if it has to be something cheap like a walk or locking yourself into a room.", "NTA. You wanted alone time and he\u2019s not respecting that, he even said he\u2019s taken time off to \u201cbe there for you \u201c after you made it clear you didn\u2019t want that.", "NAH\n\nTell him how you feel. I know a lot of people in your husband's position would have been worried about you and it makes sense he thought he was doing the right thing. Just tell him that you would like some alone time.", "NAH.  The thing is death can make people do things that usually wouldn't.  If he wasn't there for you, he would be an AH, he is there for you he's an AH, it's a no-win situation.  He is sounds like he genuinely worried about you, and he is trying to make sure you are ok.  Please don't be angry with him!  He is also not trying to use it for his own gain.\n\nYou have been together for 30 years, and he is trying to be nice.  You are going to have to deal with your father's death, and hopefully it will be in a healthy way.", "I'm confused about the dynamic here. How does him taking time off work ruin your quiet time? He works from home anyway so it's not like he wasn't around the house.\n\nSounds like he was being thoughtful and interpreted your \"no I'm fine\" as not really being fine. But like you've been married so long, you should have these kinds of communications down.", "NAH.  If he worked and you put that on here hoards of people would be telling you to \"leave  the monster\".  Go into a room and close the door (if he knocks let him know you need time totally alone in a room then stop answering,) take long walks, book a spa day, hit up libraries and coffee shops.  If he continues to knock, etc. it is time for a sit down talk on this, although it is baffling to me that that hasn't happened in 30 years.", "NAH\n\nIf someone comes from a relatively healthy family with relatively good relationships with both parent's they probably will not understand the reason you don't feel especially grieved. Husband is likely just very concerned about your wellbeing based on his lived experienced and possibly thinks you only told him you'd be fine because you didn't want to trouble him.\n\nCommunicate to him that while you appreciate him taking the time off, you really do just need some time alone to process things, but that you are and will be okay. It's important he understands where your head is at and where you're coming from.", "Nah. But weird thing to get upset about. Just because you are both off doesn\u2019t mean you have to spend every second together", "YTA. Why? Because you did not use your words to communicate to your husband that you wanted/needed some alone time to process your grief. Your husband sacrificed his (limited) PTO to be available for you. How do you respond? Not by communicating your needs, but by lashing out. Your husband is not a mind reader, no matter how many years you've been together.", "NAH It is in your right to want alone time. However I feel the sentiment that you wanted alone time was not communicated. He took time off so that he could help you work through a loss. He was trying to be supportive.", "He should have asked before taking time off, but do you really need a week of quiet time to yourself? Do you have a ton of PTO days that you still take time off with him? Do you think he's not being genuine that he thought you might need support?\n\nIt seems like there should be a reasonable way to say you need time alone, and you expect your wishes to be respected, even if it's for the first few days and not the whole week. It's reasonable for anyone to want some alone time, but I don't think either of you are assholes, just maybe miscommunication. NAH.", "INFO: \n\nWhats stopping you from still having time alone? I assume you have multiple rooms in your house. Can you shut the door for an hour and take a bubble bath, and generally just avoid him in the house?\n\nYou said he WFH, so he would have been there regardless.

On one hand, I can't blame him, but on the other hand, he's a complete asshole for framing it as if it's so he can 'be there for you' and infringing on your planned alone time.", "So your hubby is smart enough to take advantage of the free days off offered for bereavement and that\u2019s what you\u2019re upset at???

No TV, no video games, just me finally reading a book, doing a puzzle, or something else with no noise. He can't get by one minute without having the television on, playing video games, or reading stuff out loud to me that he finds on Facebook.\nMy job is very mentally taxing, and I wanted a few days to just have no noise or interruptions of any kind.

She can't give information in drips and drabs to make herself look better.\n\nUltimately, even assuming *arguendo* that OP's husband is sitting around gaming, how does that hurt OP? It doesn't. She doesn't get to just be angry without at least attempting to communicate her needs. Nothing in her original post suggests she attempted to do that.
