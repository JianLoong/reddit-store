I\u2019d be losing my damn mind by now.", "Although admirable, cutting the power is not a good thing.  What if he had some sort of medical device plugged in the same outlet?  I suggest you respond with \"I don't know what happened\" rather than confess.  YTA.", "Esh.  He shouldn't have an alarm that is so disturbing to a neighbor.

Magnificent!", "NTA and i would continue to do it everytime it happens until he stops", "I feel like you know YTA", "I would say jt was a bit of a jerk move but an understandable one. A half hour alarm at 330 is a lot but at the same time he's entitled to use his apartment as he wants. Personally I'd set an extremely loud alarm to go off for a half hour everyday In the late evening/early night (like 7 or 8pm?) assuming he goes to bed early to wake up early. I bet it would only take a few days for him to decide that maybe there is a compromise yall can reach lol\n\nI have sympathy for you but I'm going ESH. The same reasons you have for hating his alarm are the same reasons he needs it - he is also a full human being with needs like you, I promise he's not having that alarm go off just to be quirky or whatever. \n\nSide note are your apartments separately metered for electricity? The fact that the fuse boxes overlap like that indicates that possibly you aren't, and if you aren't your landlord shouldn't be able to hold you responsible for electric, he has to pay it himself and build it in your rent. Completely off topic but landlords will swindle you on that I paid for my neighbors two box acs for months before I looked up my tenants rights", "This sucks all around, but you had no idea what this dude had plugged in. You were extremely reckless. E S H. Edit: NTA, since OP only turned off his alarm and were aware that it was the only appliance that got unplugged. I understand having a switched schedule and being a heavy sleeper, but there has to be another method. In other posts when it was something like dogs barking or babies crying Reddit has gone NTA route, and those are much harder to control than your own alarm.", "YTA, you cut power to his apartment. Nothing else is needed to be said. Like genuinely you could\u2019ve put in your earplugs and had the same effect.\n\nEdit: let the dude know about the alarm, and how it\u2019s affecting you, don\u2019t just cut power to a someone\u2019s place.", "YTA, but I get it. You should start filing noise complaints though. You shouldn't have to deal with his alarm. Or you should set a similar alarm to go off right before you go to bed. You may be able to call a truce to shut off your alarms.", "ESH\n\nAlternatively, instead of flat out cutting the power you could have just knocked on his door and told him to wake up and turn his stupid alarm off. \n\nThis kind of issue should be taken up with a landlord and you and your neighbors should have filed noise complaints by now. Cutting the power is a little extreme.", "NTA, and keep doing it. If he ask you about it, insist you're a light sleeper and need to shut off his power to sleep.", "INFO\n\nI don't believe this actually happened since it's 2023 and most people would have an alarm on their phone or batter-operated alarm clock. I haven't seen anyone using a plugged-in alarm for over a decade.", "ESH, but you more than him. Your work and being on time and well rested is SOOOO important, but if he\u2019s late or oversleeps, oh well, too bad. You don\u2019t know what type of medical conditions he may have that he sleeps heavily, you don\u2019t know why he has to get up at that hour. YOU forgetting your white noise isn\u2019t his fault. He should definitely find a better alarm or turn it off quicker but you turning off his power is messed up.", "None of this makes sense. Weird wiring aside. If you turned it off then immediately back on and he has never seen the breaker in your place.....why would he even suspect you for anything??", "Slightly YTA. Have you tried sleeping somewhere else other than the bedroom? You can\u2019t just cut someone\u2019s power off like that imo. I don\u2019t know what your neighbor does for work but he might actually need that alarm", "YTA for shutting off the circuit but he\u2019s TA for letting the alarm go off for 30 minutes at 3:30.  I\u2019d report him to apartment management for disturbing the peace at 3:30 am repeatedly.  They could move him to the other side of the building where there may be less people for him to disturb.", "If you live in a place where you can hear through the walls you\u2019ve got a lot more options before you mess with someone else - sound proofing, insulation, noise cancelling ear pods etc. while I admit it would be frustrating, you went too far. YTA.", "If he didn't need to get up for work, it would be a different situation, but since he does, I'm going with YTA. There's lots of DIY ways to add noise insulation to a specific wall; there's even an 18 pack of soundproofing panels on Amazon for under $40.", "YTA. You cut off power to part of his apartment. Talk to the owner/landlord to see what can be done to soundproof your walls, or don\u2019t forget to wear earplugs.", "YTA. You can't just shut off someone else's power on your own accord. What kind of apartment complex puts a breaker box in a place that people can do this anyway?!?!", "Just day, you had to use the bathroom and stumbled and might have touched the switch on accident, lol.", "NTA. If it's loud enough that you can wake up and flip the breaker, it's loud enough for him to get up.", "Suggest that he gets a vibrating alarm to put on his bed. Then start recording the noise and report him legally through management, noise ordinance, etc.", "NTA. Tell him you found it off. Did he do anything differently? Any new things yo trip it? Or tell him your new system is tripping it. Oh well, sorry.", "NTA\n\nThat much noise at 3 fucking 30 in the AM every day for 30 minutes & all you did was flip the breaker? KUDOS", "Turn the breaker off and leave it off", "NTA. I get sick just from thinking about that alarm. While I don't usually condone lying. I wouldn't say I cut of his power, that can be your little secret.  \nA good tip for your neighbor though. Suggest a vibrating alarm clock. A good one can go for as little as $20, and it doesn't upset the neighbors.  \nMy ex had one of those ridiculously strong alarms to get up, because she was a heavy sleeper, and I felt physically ill from the sound. She got a vibrating alarm under her pillow, and I didn't want to become an evil scientist bent on destroying the world each morning.", "NTA. You tried other avenues for solving the problem and that didnt work.", "> If he doesn\u2019t do something about it, you could complain to the landlord\n\nThat was the thing to do *before* OP shut off his power.", "I agree with this, but still think op is TA for doing it herself. There\u2019s a bunch of routes that could\u2019ve been taken besides shutting off someone\u2019s power", "hmm yeah...damn that's weird..hope it doesn't happen over and over!  \n\n\nBut no, maybe I should have included this but we are friendly and I do like the guy. I don't hold any resentment towards him, and he said he feels bad, but that he just needs it to wake up so early bc his job starts early", "OP stated in another comment that they had talked about it with the neighbour and there were no medical devices or any other sensitive equipment.", "Medical devices are supposed to have a backup power reserve in the event of an outage so the user doesn\u2019t die. Power outages would be much more deadly if they didn\u2019t.", "Since he routinely makes loud noises at 3:30 AM seems like he might be sabotaging other people's ability to show up on time.

I kinda thought it was no big deal because its just one outlet, but I guess I don't know that for sure.   \n\n\nAnd I get what you're saying.

Liiiike OP you were already awake, you can't unring a bell. Maybe I'm just way less confrontational a neighbor than most redditors", "If a loud alarm going off in his bedroom doesn't wake him up, I don't have hope for a person at the front door. This sounds like an on going issue too, so multiple visits early in the morning. \n\nI wouldn't get up at 3:30 am to leave my apartment to go knock on my neighbors door 5 days a week.", ">If he ask you about it, insist you're a light sleeper and need to shut off his power to sleep.\n\nDo not tell this neighbor what you're doing.

What power cut?", "I have a plugged in alarm clock.", "He told me that he got this alarm clock specifically because when he would use his phone the alarm would shut itself off before he got up.", "I don't buy this either,  it's similar to another post a few months ago.", "If his alarm rang because he has to get up early, he switched it off and everyone moved on with their lives, yeah, I\u2019m with you. Some people have to get up at 3.30, it is what it is.\n\nHe lets it ring for 30 minutes at that time when he knows it\u2019s disturbing people? Yeah, he\u2019s a dick, and he can\u2019t seriously expect people to put up with that.

IMO it should be HE (HIM?) who is adapting to his lifestyle, not you.", "Tell him to get a vibrating alarm. If the complex won't do anything, file a noise complaint with the police. Start recording it.", "That's why I would go the petty route of setting my own regular alarm at a time inconvenient to him, so he can really fully understand the problem, because it's likely just him dismissing you as exaggerating or not thinking it's a big deal. But even my suggestion is a little petty and immature, who knows what could have been screwed up for him by you disabling the alarm altogether? If you found out he got fired for a no call no show would you feel good about what you did?\n\nUltimately two wrongs don't make a right. He's being inconsiderate and a huge pain in the ass but the way to solve that isn't to escalate the bad behavior.", "He is not entitled to violate noise ordinances and disturb other tenants.

It's a pretty accepted part of living in a building that you are going to hear noise and smell smells from other units. If it were music or the TV I might be inclined to agree but no quiet hours agreement I've signed in any lease has included alarms, most don't even include TV or music because it's not realistic, instead focusing on mitigating factors like requiring a certain amount of rug coverage for upstairs units.", "Then definitely NTA!", "No I get that, BUT I mean really let the dude know and essentially say \u201chey if this keeps going on sorry I\u2019ll have to get the apartment manager involved it\u2019s effecting me that badly.\u201d\n\nShutting off someone\u2019s power?

Mostly the strong ones, like popcorn or fish. And its not regulated just to food, like I know the guy down the hall is a massive stoner because the hallway always smells of pot enough that you can trace it back to his apartment. I'm honestly a little baffled by the thought that smeeling neighbors foods in a building is considered not normal (do these people have airtight steel walls???) lol I can even thibk of other trolls on here in which the topic has come up, like for example the \"can I tell my foreign neighbor not to cook his stinky food in his apt\" stories that I've seen more than once.", "So in this scenario the neighbor has an early alarm for some reason.

You will get the same amount of sleep as a normal person at that point imho you just seem lazy and greedy that alone could\u2019ve cost him his job just because you forgot to put in your earbuds he\u2019s clearly got some kind of security job where if anything\u2019s stolen and turning up Kate will be taking out of his pay and losing his job just so you can get an extra bit of sleep just seems greedy he may also have autism and needs that alarm and freaks out when it doesn\u2019t go out like that just live your neighbour please he\u2019s clearly not very wealthy if he\u2019s living in a thin walled apartment so something like losing his job or not having pay could really mess up his life yta", "NTA, it's 3:30am", "Tell him to get one of those bed shaker alarms.", "NTA. \u201cWeird.

His alarm clearly isn't working for him anyway. My husband has to get up at 3:30 as well. I am a light sleeper and he's a heavy one, but he somehow manages to get up and turn it off after a minute or 2.

PF flashing on your microwave.", "NTA, I am a very deep sleeper but will shut off my alarm in my sleep/without being fully conscious, so I have alarms set for every 30 minutes that are SUPER loud and annoying and can still sleep through them. However, I moved in with my in-laws, and after about a month, my MIL complained to my husband about how obnoxious my alarms are. So you know what I did? I got a Pavlok wrist alarm, aptly named the 'Pavlok Shock Clock', and it literally shocks you like a bark collar to wake you up. I STILL occasionally sleep through it somehow, but it's more effective and doesn't annoy the fuck out of others.", "Hey, your neighbor seems like the target market for this thing.  It's an alarm clock that shocks him awake if he doesn't respond to the vibrate alarm.

Every damn morning for a whole year. I genuinely do not understand how. It was an IPhone alarm, and there was no way he left his phone behind because it would always turn off around 5am, and iPhone alarms don\u2019t just stop on their own. I had to change my alarm sound because his alarm was the same as mine and I started sleeping through my own alarm. I\u2019m a heavy sleeper as it is, so after that, it didn\u2019t really bother me. However, my boyfriend is a crazy light sleeper and would complain about it most mornings. And quite a few times, I woke up to him staring at the ceiling in the middle of the night because he couldn\u2019t sleep. We were so glad to move out of that apartment for that reason and a few other more major issues as well. We also never complained because we shared walls in that area with two neighbors and we weren\u2019t sure which one it was, but I would\u2019ve shut that alarm off personally if I could have.", "This is a joke, right?", "Good night, do they not teach anyone about punctuation anymore? I have worked second shift jobs. They don't give you magical extra time to sleep because you work later into the night. OP still has a sleep schedule and a time she needs to be awake by. It is completely unreasonable, in any apartment/condo setting, to blast any sort of loud, constant noise during the time most people are sleeping. This guy's neighbors have jobs too, and he might be costing them theirs by interrupting their sleep.", "As the alarm goes off for 30 minutes, it's not working. Tell him to get a shake-awake and stop being a jerk. NTA.", "If he actually felt bad, he'd get a vibrating alarm or a pavlok (those things are a godsend).
