Working in healthcare and dealing with very irrational family members as they grieve, we see and experience verbal abuse ALL the time.", "What a hypocrite", "NTA, he needs to grow up and hold himself accountable... often times when people knowing neglect an elderly relative until it is too late, they can't handle the guilt of not being around more, so they look for someone else to blame.", "NTA. He's not going to get any less dead had you found him a day after he passed vs them finding him three months afterwards. Plus since he died in his sleep, he probably died in his bed, so the decomposition would have mostly affected the mattress.... probably.... his family isn't being very logical but I guess sometimes emotions aren't logical.", "NTA \n\nYou responded to being verbally assaulted. Just because he felt guilty, that did not give him the right to make it anyone else's problem.", "NTA. I get he\u2019s grieving but they were responsible for the old man. You weren\u2019t.

Your points were valid. It's not your fault at all. Yelling at neighbors isn't going to accomplish anything.", "NTA\n\nHe must have not have cared or even listened about what you said, if he went immediately to the neighbors. Y\u2019all are easy targets for his guilt and just wanted to yell abuse at people so he could do something. \n\nDon\u2019t worry.

This is what my brothers and I have set up with my mom, as she's gotten older. There are three of us and we have it worked out that we each call on a specific day of the week, so if she doesn't answer we know to either go over or have a well check done. She's also arranged with her neighbor across the street that they watch out for each other. If one of them hasn't opened their drapes by a certain time they will call to check on each other.", "It's incredibly easy to describe how someone \"should\" have acted in an after-the-fact-weren't-actually-there conversation.

Fuck that.", "So, for three months, there were no phone calls, texts, or emails either answered or initiated by your neighbor. Conclusion: They weren't concerned enough to try to contact him or ignored that they weren't able to get a response. For three months. None of them called the local cops for a welfare check. No one who lived reasonably close (which, in this case, I consider less than a day's drive, not simply within the same city) bothered to come and check on an *elderly* man. And they think his neighbors should have been more attentive than his family. NTA. Feeling guilty about your inaction does not give you the right to blame others for theirs.", "NTA - You were completely right when you turned it back on them, they are redirecting their anger at you and the other neighbours because no one wants to accept that one phone all would have prevented this drama months ago.", "ESH. Obviously he's in the wrong but your parents have a point. Just say you didn't know the deceased and shut the door.", "NTA\n\nBut it\u2019s true. Why did it take *3 months* for him to realise he was dead? That is firmly on his family. People need to look out for their elders. A week is understandable.

He's  T A", "NTA.   \nWhy the hell didn't he checked in on his dad?  \nIf he wanted you to keep an eye on his dad, did he ask for it?  \nGrief or not, he shouldn't have done that and him and his family can take their self righteousness and shove it up where the sun don't shine.  \nThey should've kept an eye on their loved ones, and if they wanted someone else to do that, they've should've asked politely.", "3 months? 3 FUCKING MONTHS?! That's how long this man was dead in his home? If you point your finger at someone, you have 3 more pointing back at you. Sounds like someone feels guilty and is trying to justify neglect by accusing others. NTA!!", "NTA.  And no excuses for this oh-so-bereaved relative who didn't look in on the old man for 3 months and then called you names.  What an asshole.  It's always like that--the ones who moved to Brazil and haven't called home in 5 years are always the most enraged that \"no one did enough to save them.\"", "came back to more downvotes than i ever would have expected. cold-hearted, unsympathetic people surround theirselves with cold-hearted unsympathetic people. his grandfather is dead. he was alone, and his body rotted for months. sorry OP got his feelings hurt, sorry empathy is so hard. you'll be treated how you treat others, and then some. i treat others well and i still don't get treated well in return. everyone downvoting this better be ready for people around them to turn on them when they have an emotional outburst like this guy. you get no sympathy, you get no empathy. you get what you give.", "The guy was obviously projecting his guilt onto his family member\u2019s neighbors and I don\u2019t think that is okay. I honestly don\u2019t think op crossed a line that hadn\u2019t already been crossed when they said that it was the family\u2019s responsibility to check on the guy, because if strangers have the responsibility of making sure their neighbors aren\u2019t dead, then the guy\u2019s actual family should bear that burden even more.\n\nI get sometimes time creeps up on us, but no one in this guy\u2019s family even bothered to visit or even call him in at least three months, maybe more when he was still alive?", "Exactly. 90 or so days of his own son not even bothering to get in contact or visit but it's random neigbors' jobs to check up on the elderly residents nobody knows. Dude's trying to scapegoat hard.", "Humans can get irrational during grief but even if that were to be ok most humans also doesn't respond well when someone screams at their face\n\nHe didn't check on his pops for 3 months not even a text or a call and he has the audacity to tell at you, it would have been acceptable if he has apologized to you after realizing what he was doing but he doubled down on the next neighbor and probably next one over too\n\nNTA death is hard but that doesn't give you a permit to be an asshole", "At best, he'd get punched, and in some places, he'd get s h o t. (Mileage may vary depending on part of the country.)", "This. NTA op", "My grandfather had a stroke and my parents were at his apartment 30 minutes later (his coffee was still warm). Apparently he and his girlfriend chatted on the phone while drinking coffee every morning, and she called my parents when he didn't pick up.", "NTA your parents can go hike for not rocking the boat mentaly", "Grieving people don\u2019t get a free pass to be AHs , like seriously it wasn\u2019t your responsibility to look after someone they never bother to check on. You made a good point to that person", "Everything you said is true. Like everyone said, the relative is just grasping at straws to find someone to blame.", "Nta. I think you handled it perfectly. Better than i would have. Grief isnt a free pass to be rude, cruel or to pass your lack of responsibility onto someone else", "NTA. Wow! Talk about projection!", "You were way nicer about it than I would have been. I would have asked him point blank why the hell HE didn't check up on his own relative and how he could go THREE MONTHS of no communication yet do nothing?\n\nThis likely would have been an asshole move but you come for me swinging expect to get hit back.", "NTA you dont know them, they dont know your life or problems and have no right to expect you to join in and help with theirs let alone yell at you for not doing so. sure its nice to help people where you can but we all have our own shit to deal with its not fair to expect strangers to help solve your problems", "NTA. Are you kidding? He verbally assaulted you and they want you to roll over? \n\nF that noise. \n\nYou come in swinging you better have your doctor on speed dial.", "Precisely.", "Heard on the news last week of a guy they discovered who had been dead since 2017. He had already completely skeletonized by now. The reason nobody noticed is because he was already living very reclusively, and his rent was automatically paid each month through government subsidies. They only found him when local government finally decided to research some unpaid taxes he still owed.", "You're not an asshole but you're kind of a jerk. It's obvious this person was feeling guilty so projected this by lashing out on the neighbors. It doesn't hurt you to kill someone with kindness. It takes zero effort to have empathy for someone grieving and understanding they are lashing out from it. You didn't need to take a jab at them. It also wouldn't have killed you to apologize and explain you were new and didn't know him at all.\n\nBefore anybody hops on me about it not being their responsibility to bear their anger, if we aren't somewhat kind and understanding during moments like this, the world will continue to be shiity and full of selfish people.", "Yup, this was sustained neglect/disinterest.", "They didn't even call him, let alone visit in 3 months..", "I exchange Wordle scores with my dad every day. It\u2019s a nice way to keep in touch without him feeling like I\u2019m keeping tabs on him.", "also"]}
