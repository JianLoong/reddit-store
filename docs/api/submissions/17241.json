And what you said was correct. He's feeling guilty for visiting the old guy so rarely, and he's trying to put the blame on everyone else.", "So its your responsibility for the old guy you don't know ...and his son who hasn't seen him or heard from him in three months is mad at you...yeah..you're not the asshole...you just got in his cross hairs...sorry bud", "NTA- Clearly his family should have been the ones to check in on him more often. Sometimes people blame others to stop themselves from feeling the guilt over these types of situations", "NTA, his grief and pain is not an excuse to call you names and shout abusively at you. You did fine in the heat of the moment, even if a shorter response would have been better.", "NTA - A stranger came to YOUR door and hurled expletives and accusations as if you were the caretaker of the old man. He is undeniably in the wrong and you put him in his place rightfully so. He has no right to do those things just because he is grieving. You\u2019re not guilty of anything and once again like you mentioned, you didn\u2019t even know the man. He was not your responsibility", "NTA, this stranger took his frustrations and grief out on you, not knowing if you even knew your neighbor or anything. I don't think what you said was harsh or uncalled for, he wanted to argue and you shut him down.", "NTA\u2014you were right.  They failed to take any action for 3 months.  They let him stew in a puddle of ooze, it\u2019s on them not you or his neighbors", "NTA. Literally would have told the guy to F off before I call the cops.", "NTA. You were totally right. Besides he was just projecting his guilt on you.", "Nta. Guy was looking for a fight. Too bad you didn't oblige.", "NTA. I would have done the same. We had an old man die in the house across the street. Everyone had been checking on him, and then he got an aide so we stopped. Unfortunately no one knew that his assistance ended and so we didn't go checking on him.", "NTA. The man had no right to blame you/ demand that you were supposed to do something for someone you don't even know.  Especially since you are new.", "NTA why DID it take 3 months for them to find his lifeless husk? Don\u2019t take it personally they probably know they\u2019re shit and reacted accordingly", "NTA and he's just trying to blame other people for his not noticing, either.", "ESH. You were both being inconsiderate, neither of you should have snapped.\n\nHe should have thought it through and tried to put himself in you and the other neighbours' shoes instead of just running around snapping at everyone.\n\nYou should have thought about the fact that he was grieving and tried to be more understanding when replying to his accusations.\n\nI can totally understand both of your reactions though.\n\n He was grieving and probably not thinking straight due to this. He's taking his grief out on the neighbours, which is wrong but an understandable coping strategy in his situation.\n\nYou were tired and stressed from a long day, and you opened your door, already feeling like rubbish, to a man yelling accusations at you. I can understand it would be very hard to stay calm in that situation, no matter the circumstances.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I do get why you yelled though, and if I'm being completely honest I can't say I would have done any different."]}
