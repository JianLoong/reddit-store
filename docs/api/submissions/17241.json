Me and others were c-nts for not looking out for each other.\n\nI\u2019d already had a bad day at work, so my mood wasn\u2019t great. I was so stunned by the audacity of a stranger shouting abuse at me; I lost my temper. I didn\u2019t shout back, but I was very snappy. I told the guy that I\u2019m sorry the old man had passed, but I\u2019m new, and I never even met him - how was I supposed to know when he usually turned his lights on or left the house?

And what you said was correct. He's feeling guilty for visiting the old guy so rarely, and he's trying to put the blame on everyone else.", "So its your responsibility for the old guy you don't know ...and his son who hasn't seen him or heard from him in three months is mad at you...yeah..you're not the asshole...you just got in his cross hairs...sorry bud", "NTA- Clearly his family should have been the ones to check in on him more often. Sometimes people blame others to stop themselves from feeling the guilt over these types of situations", "NTA, his grief and pain is not an excuse to call you names and shout abusively at you. You did fine in the heat of the moment, even if a shorter response would have been better.", "NTA - A stranger came to YOUR door and hurled expletives and accusations as if you were the caretaker of the old man. He is undeniably in the wrong and you put him in his place rightfully so. He has no right to do those things just because he is grieving. You\u2019re not guilty of anything and once again like you mentioned, you didn\u2019t even know the man. He was not your responsibility", "NTA, this stranger took his frustrations and grief out on you, not knowing if you even knew your neighbor or anything. I don't think what you said was harsh or uncalled for, he wanted to argue and you shut him down.", "NTA\u2014you were right.  They failed to take any action for 3 months.  They let him stew in a puddle of ooze, it\u2019s on them not you or his neighbors", "NTA. Literally would have told the guy to F off before I call the cops.", "NTA. You were totally right. Besides he was just projecting his guilt on you.", "Nta. Guy was looking for a fight. Too bad you didn't oblige.", "NTA. I would have done the same. We had an old man die in the house across the street. Everyone had been checking on him, and then he got an aide so we stopped. Unfortunately no one knew that his assistance ended and so we didn't go checking on him.", "NTA. The man had no right to blame you/ demand that you were supposed to do something for someone you don't even know.  Especially since you are new.", "NTA why DID it take 3 months for them to find his lifeless husk? Don\u2019t take it personally they probably know they\u2019re shit and reacted accordingly", "NTA and he's just trying to blame other people for his not noticing, either.", "ESH. You were both being inconsiderate, neither of you should have snapped.\n\nHe should have thought it through and tried to put himself in you and the other neighbours' shoes instead of just running around snapping at everyone.\n\nYou should have thought about the fact that he was grieving and tried to be more understanding when replying to his accusations.\n\nI can totally understand both of your reactions though.\n\n He was grieving and probably not thinking straight due to this. He's taking his grief out on the neighbours, which is wrong but an understandable coping strategy in his situation.\n\nYou were tired and stressed from a long day, and you opened your door, already feeling like rubbish, to a man yelling accusations at you. I can understand it would be very hard to stay calm in that situation, no matter the circumstances.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m betting that they are lashing out at the neighbors because they desperately need to have someone else to blame other than themselves.", "That\u2019s a really good point! \n\nGuilt isn\u2019t a nice feeling to experience, especially when tied with grief. Don\u2019t go screaming at us neighbours though!\n\nThank you.", "Thank you.\n\nMy parents were coming from the \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d angle, but the sheer cheek of someone coming to my door to shout me had me raging.

I\u2019m not proud that I lost my temper - and it took strength not to actually shout back at the man - but god knows what was going through his head.\n\nFor all I know, he could just be an arse, or he could be feeling really embarrassed for shouting at a load of people.", "I guess that to be as understanding as possible for the guy, I know that after a death people will often lash out and start to blame everyone: it's human nature to want to make sense of death, to find someone to blame, to make death  less irrational, less arbitary. But I suspect it's mainly guilt. Clearly they were not close, and I guess he now regrets it.", "Yes absolutely, for all you know he's actually a nice guy and just got caught up in his grief. I do get why you yelled though, and if I'm being completely honest I can't say I would have done any different.", "NTA. So he has no obligation to figure out what the hell is going on with his own father but total strangers are supposed to be monitoring him?  Sounds like he wants to blame strangers for his own neglect.", "You were correct and not an AH for saying what you did, I would have said similar.", "NTA \n\nThat was the perfect response and you are 100% right!", "NTA.  Strangers who bang on my door and screech abuse at me get the cops called on them.  I'm surprised that the cops didn't end up there, considering that they were banging on multiple doors and screaming at everyone.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your responsibility and you didn\u2019t deserve to be yelled at. \n\nHowever, you knew they were grieving and you say in the post you understand where the lashing out came from. I think a better thing to do would have just been to close the door lol. They\u2019re likely going to be embarrassed when they come out of the grief fog. \n\nNot an asshole by any means, but sometimes it\u2019s best to just ignore it and close the door. Don\u2019t worry though, this was a tough position to be put in. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get over it sooner rather than later.", "NTA- he\u2019s just embarrassed by his own guilt and wrongly lashing out", "NTA but that guy sounds like a piece of work, I doubt 'grieving' has got anything to do with it.", "NTA. His family clearly has minimal contact if it took that long to catch on something was wrong.\n\nIt isn't your responsibility or that of any other neighbor to pay attention to his schedule. \n\nPeople travel, go into the hospital and long term care, all without neighbors having any idea.\n\nIt's really up to family to maintain sufficient contact to know whether there's something wrong.\n\nThey seem like people who would blame neighbors for not doing things fir their family.", "NTA. He's grieving, sure, but he also knows you're right. Why DIDN'T anyone in the family check on him? Why didn't the guy yelling at you? He feels guilty & is trying to make it ANYONE else's problem. Fuck that.", "NTA. Mess with the bull, you get the horns. Him verbally abusing you in your own home is unacceptable.", "NTA  \n\n\n\"I said it was the responsibility of his family to check in with him, and if they\u2019re going to accuse other people of being self-involved, what about them? Why did it take his family three months to find their relative?\"  \n\n\nYou're not wrong.", "You made some valid points.  This guy knocked on your door to yell at you about not keeping an eye on a neighbor you never met and you recently moved in.  \n\nI casually know a neighbor from my walks in the neighborhood. We would sit and chat.  She was in her 70s and had cancer. She died. I suspected she did based on her back door not being opened and other little signs. When I saw people there, I knocked. She had died a month ago.  I had suspected for about 3 weeks. \n\nThe family checked in with her and each other. She died in the night. In her sleep. One of the feral cats who would come in during storms was lying with her body. Her brother came to her house when she hadn\u2019t texted with anyone that day. \n\nI am all for looking out for certain neighbors. But that rapport is built over time. \n\nI have friends that if I go a day without replying to texts, they think I am dead. And I think the same thing. \n\nMy 85 year old hard of hearing MIL loves texting. Now there are cameras and other things to keep in contact with elderly relatives and anyone. \n\nThis guy was feeling guilty. Three months passed and he didn\u2019t have contact with his relative.  \n\nI can\u2019t believe he moved on to another house to yell at them.", "NTA- you were absolutely right in what you said to him. He came to your doorstep hurling abuse at you, and he was out of line.", "I\u2019m not sure if the man was his father - he could have been! He just said he was family.\n\nMaybe he was really going through it that day\u2026but it\u2019s hard to have sympathy when some rando is shouting at you on your doorstep!", "That\u2019s what I think, which is really sad (unless he\u2019s unstable or just an arsehole anyway).", "I\u2019m in the UK. Where I live, we only call the police when there\u2019s an emergency. I imagine a lot of people won\u2019t worry too much about a shouty man unless he made actual threats or started damaging property - or if he came back to shout more.", "Thanks.\n\nWe just don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve seen some of my own relatives behave badly or strangely due to grief, so you never know. He pissed me off so badly, I had very little sympathy for him in the heat of the moment. \ud83d\ude2c He could just be a prick."]}
