He's taking his grief out on the neighbours, which is wrong but an understandable coping strategy in his situation.\n\nYou were tired and stressed from a long day, and you opened your door, already feeling like rubbish, to a man yelling accusations at you.

But I suspect it's mainly guilt. Clearly they were not close, and I guess he now regrets it.", "Yes absolutely, for all you know he's actually a nice guy and just got caught up in his grief. I do get why you yelled though, and if I'm being completely honest I can't say I would have done any different.", "NTA. So he has no obligation to figure out what the hell is going on with his own father but total strangers are supposed to be monitoring him?

Strangers who bang on my door and screech abuse at me get the cops called on them.  I'm surprised that the cops didn't end up there, considering that they were banging on multiple doors and screaming at everyone.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your responsibility and you didn\u2019t deserve to be yelled at. \n\nHowever, you knew they were grieving and you say in the post you understand where the lashing out came from. I think a better thing to do would have just been to close the door lol. They\u2019re likely going to be embarrassed when they come out of the grief fog. \n\nNot an asshole by any means, but sometimes it\u2019s best to just ignore it and close the door. Don\u2019t worry though, this was a tough position to be put in. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll get over it sooner rather than later.", "NTA- he\u2019s just embarrassed by his own guilt and wrongly lashing out", "NTA but that guy sounds like a piece of work, I doubt 'grieving' has got anything to do with it.", "NTA. His family clearly has minimal contact if it took that long to catch on something was wrong.\n\nIt isn't your responsibility or that of any other neighbor to pay attention to his schedule. \n\nPeople travel, go into the hospital and long term care, all without neighbors having any idea.\n\nIt's really up to family to maintain sufficient contact to know whether there's something wrong.\n\nThey seem like people who would blame neighbors for not doing things fir their family.", "NTA. He's grieving, sure, but he also knows you're right. Why DIDN'T anyone in the family check on him? Why didn't the guy yelling at you? He feels guilty & is trying to make it ANYONE else's problem.

Him verbally abusing you in your own home is unacceptable.", "NTA  \n\n\n\"I said it was the responsibility of his family to check in with him, and if they\u2019re going to accuse other people of being self-involved, what about them?

This guy knocked on your door to yell at you about not keeping an eye on a neighbor you never met and you recently moved in.  \n\nI casually know a neighbor from my walks in the neighborhood. We would sit and chat.  She was in her 70s and had cancer. She died. I suspected she did based on her back door not being opened and other little signs. When I saw people there, I knocked. She had died a month ago.  I had suspected for about 3 weeks. \n\nThe family checked in with her and each other. She died in the night. In her sleep. One of the feral cats who would come in during storms was lying with her body. Her brother came to her house when she hadn\u2019t texted with anyone that day. \n\nI am all for looking out for certain neighbors. But that rapport is built over time. \n\nI have friends that if I go a day without replying to texts, they think I am dead. And I think the same thing. \n\nMy 85 year old hard of hearing MIL loves texting. Now there are cameras and other things to keep in contact with elderly relatives and anyone. \n\nThis guy was feeling guilty. Three months passed and he didn\u2019t have contact with his relative.  \n\nI can\u2019t believe he moved on to another house to yell at them.", "NTA- you were absolutely right in what you said to him. He came to your doorstep hurling abuse at you, and he was out of line.", "I\u2019m not sure if the man was his father - he could have been!

Where I live, we only call the police when there\u2019s an emergency.

I\u2019ve seen some of my own relatives behave badly or strangely due to grief, so you never know. He pissed me off so badly, I had very little sympathy for him in the heat of the moment. \ud83d\ude2c He could just be a prick.", "NTA. It would be one thing if you knew your neighbor well and saw him.often. His own family did not check on him for three months.. That man banging on your door and screaming at you is scary.", "NTA he\u2019s gonna end up getting his ass beat when he bangs on the wrong person\u2019s door", "NTA at first. Your self analysis was spot on.  When you said \"this is where I might have crossed the line\" is when you did cross the line.  Everything prior to that was direct and factual and would have been fine if it had ended there.    \nWhen you crossed the line (your words) then yes, YTA.  Some compassion and a simple \"I'm sorry\" would have gone a long way to someone who recently found their father's decomposing body and obviously was in shock and spiraling in grief.", "Based on your use of the \u201cOU\u201d in neighbor, I\u2019m guessing you don\u2019t live in the US.  In my neck of Midwest America, people who randomly show up unknown and uninvited shrieking about stuff tend to get shot. Your tongue lashing was mild.

What, 3 months of no calls being returned and they never bothered to check on him? Not your fault and I would have been more than snippy.", "NTA. That guy was projecting and he deserved to be told that relatives have a greater responsibility than complete strangers.", "NTA. They know they messed up and should have been talking to him and checking on him more frequently. Grief makes people say and do strange things, but taking it out on you is wrong. Your point hit close to home and upset them because you\u2019re correct and that hurts.", "NTA \n\nCrap son that didn\u2019t know his Dad was dead for 3 months!", "NTA- they feel guilty and are trying to place blame on the situation. Working in healthcare and dealing with very irrational family members as they grieve, we see and experience verbal abuse ALL the time.", "What a hypocrite", "NTA, he needs to grow up and hold himself accountable... often times when people knowing neglect an elderly relative until it is too late, they can't handle the guilt of not being around more, so they look for someone else to blame.", "NTA. He's not going to get any less dead had you found him a day after he passed vs them finding him three months afterwards. Plus since he died in his sleep, he probably died in his bed, so the decomposition would have mostly affected the mattress.... probably.... his family isn't being very logical but I guess sometimes emotions aren't logical.", "NTA \n\nYou responded to being verbally assaulted. Just because he felt guilty, that did not give him the right to make it anyone else's problem.", "NTA. I get he\u2019s grieving but they were responsible for the old man. You weren\u2019t. Brush that off and keep it moving.", "NTA. A good rule in life is that if you don\u2019t want to get spoken to harshly, don\u2019t scream aggressive stuff at strangers.", "NTA.", "NTA. Mutha Trucker please. Knock on my door with that BS. I\u2019m not liable for anyone else\u2019s peoples, least of all someone I never met and have no dealings with. Nobody has the right to treat you like Sh*t regardless of the circumstances. Good for you for standing your ground.", "NTA. It's an asshole move to knock on someone's door and start making accusations. Like you said, they could have checked up on their own. It wasn't even your responsibility.", "NTA\n\nYou aren\u2019t responsible for keeping track of a neighbor you never see, and who you\u2019ve never met.\n\nAnd frankly, snapping at someone who literally ambushes you at your own doorstep and starts shouting accusations at you is a perfectly normal response.", "NTA. Your points were valid. It's not your fault at all. Yelling at neighbors isn't going to accomplish anything.", "NTA\n\nHe must have not have cared or even listened about what you said, if he went immediately to the neighbors. Y\u2019all are easy targets for his guilt and just wanted to yell abuse at people so he could do something. \n\nDon\u2019t worry. We are friendly with our neighbors but I literally would never know if something happened like that nearby, I\u2019m not a creep who stares at peoples houses and know what\u2019s going on.\n\nDude if a loved one (much less an old person) doesn\u2019t answer the phone in 24 hours, they should have called the police for a welfare check. If nobody bothered to check this guy in 3 MONTHS or give a call to the police to check, they clearly did not care.", "NTA.

You told it like it is. You did just fine.  NTA", "NTA. The man is likely so angry BECAUSE you're RIGHT.", "NTA. You spoke hard truths.", "NTA\n\nI don't know why people need to be told this, but grief is not an excuse for being an asshole. Sure, it can be a reason, but that doesn't make it ok. \n\nYou're absolutely correct in that it was a mountain of guilt who pounded on your door and you told them what they needed to hear.", "He didn\u2019t even have to visit, he could have called! No call back ask the police to do a wellness check if they aren\u2019t local", "Exactly  where where any of them for 3 months.  Or obviously in the months previously.", "Yep, I\u2019m British.\nI certainly wouldn\u2019t want to shoot this man, even though he aggravated me. \ud83d\ude2c", "You were totally right.  It took family 3 months to check.  I would be ashamed if that were my family.", "Nah- you did the right thing. Being the bigger person when it comes to rude people is often times code for \u201cbe the doormat\u201d", "I hate that phrase so much. You are *already* the bigger person, by virtue of not screaming at random strangers. You were *still* the bigger person after he screamed at you and you defended yourself.", "Why is it always on the victim of abuse to \"be the bigger person\"?", "What gets me is that once OP pointed all this out, he then went to yell at another neighbor. Being upset at losing a parent is one thing, failing to realize that you're an AH and need to deal with the pain away from others (therapy, punching bag at the gym, a long run) is another.", "Exactly. A man in mine & my mother's apartment complex died recently (he was in his 60s and had just left a long stay in the hospital, my mom had been taking care of his pets), and it wasn't 2 hours after he passed that he was found. His sister called, and when he didn't answer she called the apartment's office to check on him. This guy was definitely feeling grief and guilt over how long it took"]}
