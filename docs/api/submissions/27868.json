{"id": 27868, "submission_id": "16vazev", "title": "WIBTA if I didn't get a mole removed for my friend's wedding?", "selftext": "(throwaway)\n\nHi everyone, I'm writing to you all because I've been going back and forth on this issue, and I feel conflicted.\n\nMy (24F) friend \"Zoe\" (25F) is getting married and I am set to be a bridesmaid in her wedding, which is early next year. I am excited for the wedding and am doing everything I can to help her out with planning and setting up.\n\nRecently, Zoe asked me out for coffee, away from the other bridesmaids, as she said that she wanted to talk to me about something privately. I agreed and asked her if something was wrong. She said it was nothing huge and she just wanted to talk to me.\n\nI met up with Zoe the other day, like she asked. It was there that she told me that she wanted me to get the mole on my face removed before the wedding. I have a mole on my right cheek, kind of near my nose. It's not huge, but it's definitely noticeable. Zoe explained that she wanted everyone to look good in the wedding photos as well as on the wedding day (understandable), and that the mole on my face would be a distraction, and that I wouldn't look good in the photos. She said that she would pay for the surgery out of pocket, as she could afford it, and all I would have to do is go in and get it removed. I told her that I needed time to think about it. She said she understood, but let me know that it would be mandatory for me to have the procedure in order to be a bridesmaid. I said that I would get back to her.\n\nI'm really conflicted on this because I have had times where I've been insecure about my mole, and Zoe wasn't lying when she said that it distracts from my face. So, if she was asking me to remove it, it may be better in the long run, AND she's paying for it. However, I don't really know if I want such a procedure done to my face, which is why I'm thinking about not going through with it. But Zoe is my friend, and more importantly, she's the bride and I want her to have the best day, which is why I think I may be the asshole if I didn't go through with it. Would I be wrong if I didn't get the mole on my face removed?\n\nEdit: Hi everyone. Wow thanks for all the responses. I just want to clear up a few things. Firstly, I'm not completely insecure about my mole, at least not so much anymore. I used to cover it up with foundation and heavy concealer, and all that. Now I feel more comfortable wearing less makeup and not covering it. Doesn't mean that I 100% love it, but I'm slowly starting to embrace it. In all honesty, I haven't really mentioned about my insecurity to Zoe, except maybe once or twice. What this comes down to is I don't know if I would actually want a procedure like that done, but I was conflicted because maybe going through with it would make me look better in a way. \n\nAnd to everyone commenting about photoshop, it's not just about the pictures. Zoe said that she wanted me to get it removed for the ceremony as well because she doesn't want me to look bad to the guests on her wedding day.\n\nFor reference, the mole is brown, and maybe about 1/2 a penny in size (diameter)", "created_utc": 1695992301, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16vazev/wibta_if_i_didnt_get_a_mole_removed_for_my/", "score": 4350, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Whilst it's kind to pay for something she knows you have had insecurities about attaching that condition is wildly inappropriate.\n\nI would honestly consider asking another bridesmaid what they thought about it. She is free to make whoever she wants a bridesmaid but to have any dictation over a physical change to your body is disgusting behaviour.", "wtf. that's your face. Don't get it removed for her. NTA.\n\nIf your mole is a distraction, she must be super insecure in herself and it's not on your to fix.", "All I can think of is what if the bride asked some bridesmaids to get boob reductions, and other enhancements so they all have her chest size?\n\nNTA, but if you want the surgery, no issue getting he to pay for it.", "NTA - that's very shitty of her to make it a condition. \n\nHowever, if you do want it removed anyway,  you could just take her money and do it.  \n\nBUT: youre in no way obligated to!", "NTA.

One of them I can't see at all (which is surprising as it's the darker one!) and the other you have to really zoom in and know it's there to even notice anything. I had foundation on, but it wasn't heavy, and I didn't have them covered with concealer.\n\nThis friend is mean, and your friendship should mean more to her than making you have things cut off your face for photos where they won't even be noticed. \n\nI would politely respond that you have thought about it and you don't want to change your looks permanently, and will look forward to attending as a guest. \n\nEmbrace the face moles!", "NTA  but if you want it removed let her pay then back out of the wedding.  She sounds like a jerk.  I have a moles I've had removed and some I'm keeping for life.  That is your decision.", "NTA. She is not your friend. This isn't \"hey do you mind taking your eyebrow ring out for day?\"  This is \"get surgery or don't be in my wedding\"", "I would of ended the friendship on the spot personally. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Tell her that she can keep that money and use it for a brain scan. Something\u2019s really wrong in there.", "NTA- what the hell is this \u201cfriend \u201c thinking?! \nDon\u2019t do anything to yourself you don\u2019t want to. For anyone. Period. I have a small mole on my face, and my ex husband wanted me to get it removed. Screw that! And your friend is terrible for even asking. Imagine having the balls to think you\u2019re that important. Disgusting.", "NTA. Your \u201cfriend\u201d  is a huge one. A really huge self centered one with hemorrhoids and stuck toilet paper! \nIf you want to give her a total f-u, you should accept the surgery, then drop out. Remember to get a valid reason so she can\u2019t come after you for the money. \nThen ghost her.", "Side note to the situation: I've had moles removed on my back (possible cancer concerns, not cosmetic. No skin cancer, though! I actually kinda miss em, lol). Those suckers take a while to heal because they are taking out a chunk of skin if it's any deeper than surface level. Stitches aren't always a good option for the healing process, either. My skin there looked like two cigarette burns for the longest time and still don't look like \"normal\" skin. If the wedding is early nest year, there isn't nessesarily the quick fix she thinks it is.", "NTA\nAnd you will be NTA if you accept her offer as well,  but only if you do it because you personally want that mole removed.\nThe most important thing about is actually to not allow this to change how you feel about yourself, mole or no mole.", "NTA, but please get some self-confidence and self-respect. Don't let people use you as a doormat.", "NTA. What if there are complications? Would you still be in the wedding? Would she pay for revision? She asked you to be a bridesmaid, but then later decided you needed to change your face to suit her event. There is nothing wrong with your face. The mole is a part of your face. If someone doesn't bother to look at your other than at a mole, they are not worth your time. \n\nI've had a mole removed (not from my face, although there are a few that might be soon). I would much rather have the mole back than the weird bit that's there now.", "NTA\n\nShe is not your friend.", "INFO: Do you plan on living with the mole forever?", "NTA.  This is a completely unreasonable demand of hers! You're not a prop in her wedding. \n\nThat being said, if YOU want it removed, let her pay for it. Then find an excuse to back out at the last minute. It'd be mean and petty and completely justified.  Oh, and make sure you don't pay her back, because it was out of your hands why you had to back out.", "What... let me get this right... she wants you to have cosmetic surgery to look good for her wedding day, yes?\n\nThis can't be real! The fucking audacity!\n\nNo way, do not do it. You are NTA here, Zoe is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Having said that, if you want to do it anyway, do it on her dime. But I'd turn up to the wedding with a big fkin plaster on my face afterwards  and thank her for paying for this to get fixed :)", "You would NOT be the asshole for declining to get minor surgery so you can look better for her wedding. BUT if it's something you already wanted, definitely take her up on the offer. However she's definitely TA for requesting this, extremely weird and kind of mean. NTA.", "NTA asking someone to get a cosmetic surgery to be in your wedding party is absolutely bonkers out of line.", "NTA. What is there to be inflicted about?! If it matters that much, it\u2019s a quick digital fix from the photographer. (And it shouldn\u2019t matter that much.) But permanently altering your body for her wedding? Oh hell no.", "NTA. She\"d like you to participate but only if you don't look like yourself. I also have a mole on my face but I always called it a beauty mark. Maybe it's not the best part of my face, but it's part of who I am. If Marilyn Monroe could pull it off, so can anyone else.", "NTA\n\nThe wedding photographer will more than likely be touching up the pictures anyway, and I highly doubt they'd charge extra to take a mole off of someone's face if she asked them to.  Most photographers include minor touchups with their service.  Even if they did charge extra, that would likely be less expensive than paying out of pocket for surgery.  Zoe is the AH for asking you to have it removed.  And, in my opinion, not much of a friend if something like that is a condition of being one of her bridesmaids.", "NTA and you should not associate with her anymore because you'd be an asshole to yourself if you did. She is a bully and mean and she loves the idea of \"perfect\" pictures more than she loves you. You deserve better! If I were you I would be dropping out of the wedding, not even considering it. She's horrible, I'm so sorry.", "Nta. You don't have to do anything for anyone. However, you seemed temped. If you think it's going to be good for yourself in the long run, maybe do it for yourself AND FOR FREE \ud83d\ude02. Of course it's your decision and it's ok both ways \ud83e\udd70\u2764\ufe0f whatever you decide FOR YOURSELF is good. Take care and stay healthy \ud83e\udd70", "That\u2019s someone I\u2019d decline being a bridesmaid for. How awful.\n\nAlso, has she heard of photoshop? It doesn\u2019t make her any less awful, and I still wouldn\u2019t want to be her bridesmaid, but she could\u2019ve asked her photographer to photoshop it out without having to ask you such a stupid and insensitive question. \n\nYou sure you need her as a friend?\n\nNTA\n\nI mean if you actually want it removed anyways then let her pay for it, and then tell her to fuck right off.", "NTA Damn, this is wild. My completely honest opinion, take her up on getting it removed, if you\u2019ve always been self conscious go ahead and take her up on it. Then decide if you still want to be in the wedding. Either way, it\u2019s up to you. Weddings are fun for me so I would still be a part of it and then after the wedding let that friendship drift apart. SMH I really can\u2019t believe she won\u2019t let you be in the wedding if you don\u2019t get it removed.", "This is the WRONG reason to do something that _may_ be right for you... your \"friend\" is most certainly TA.\n\nNTA... but holy smokes...\n\nHonestly... wtf?!", "NAH. I would get it removed though. I had all the ones on my face removed back in university and was so happy once they had healed. Smooth skin!", "Here's what you do: you accept her offer and let her think you still want to be a bridesmaid. Have the mole removed on her dime, then drop out of the wedding.", "NTA. Get the mole removed on her dime and then drop out of the wedding because she\u2019s a jerk.", "This is the most bananas requests I've ever seen on this sub. \n  \nObviously, NTA. I highly recommend acquiring new friends.", "Decline being a bridesmaid and get the mole removed on your own time. Or not.", "NTA -- hear this: she is NOT your friend.  Friends do NOT make demands like that.  \n\nNow, if YOU want the mole removed, by all means, let her pay for it.  I've had a couple of monster moles removed and it is so freeing but please, don't call her a friend.", "NTA. Zoe is not your friend.  If she was, she'd love you for you and wouldn't be more concerned about photos. This is no different than her telling someone \"you have to lose 50lbs to be in my wedding\". Simply awful. \n\nThat said, I'd be tempted to let her pay for it, then not be her bridesmaid.   I mean, if you wanted it done anyway and couldn't afford it.....", "NTA\n\nIf you actually don\u2019t like the mole, I would consider getting her to pay for its removal and then dropping out of the wedding because she sucks.", "I don\u2019t understand where the asshole part is supposed to be? NTA if you don\u2019t get it removed\n\nRemove that person from your life instead. Then take the prettiest selfie and photoshop or just draw a bridal dress under your mole and a crown on top of it and name it stole the show or something. Post it everywhere she can see it and don\u2019t miss out on informing your other friends about her stupid, insulting request.\n\nNever be ashamed of whatever makes you stand out from the crowd. Everything that\u2019s different is absolutely fabulous. There\u2019s nothing more boring than beauty standards. Never forget that.", "This is goddamn insane. If it would cause harm to you in the future such as cancer or something, get it removed, have her pay for it, then drop out of the wedding. I would drop the friendship even if you don\u2019t do the surgery. This is so fucked up. What the hell is wrong with her. NTA", "NTA, she\u2019s the asshole. The audacity! Fr. She can get the pics edited if it means that much to her. But id tread lightly referring to her as a \u201cfriend\u201d from now on. she\u2019s not a real one", "Wow, what entitlement! I can't imagine asking anyone to have surgery for my  wedding!  I would bow out and go NC. If you have always wanted to have it removed then fine go ahead and do it  but make sure you pick a highly qualified plastic surgeon.", "NTA x1000. She doesn't think you are beautiful just as you are. I question whether she is a friend at all. \n\nIf you want the mole removed, talk to a dermatologist about the procedure, needs, risks, etc. I assume you were born with it and it is non cancerous. I was born with a mole I rather like (not on my face) so it is totally optional to even consider this. But if you were thinking of having it removed anyway and this \"friend\" will pay for it, eh, maybe. \n\nI wouldn't personally though. And I would be questioning this friendship based on this person's poor values.", "NTA. \n\n If it were me and I did want it done- I'd totally let her pay for it and then drop out of the wedding regardless. But I can be petty.", "The hell? NTA.", "Moles are also known as beauty marks. Could she possibly be jealous?", "Nta.\n\nMole removals are pretty deep and can scar. I had a potentially malignant one removed. It didn't heal well and keloided. It's on my abdomen.\n\nTurned out to be benign but still, surgery is never guaranteed to improve looks. Also she's rude as hell.", "NTA her asking you to have surgery to be pretty enough to stand next to her on her wedding day is bananas. \n\nBut if it was something you wanted to do anyways then she can pay for it. And you can reconsider the friendship after the wedding\n\nBut also please please get consultations and reviews and go with someone reputable", "NTA If it\u2019s something YOU want to do then go ahead.  However if you\u2019re not comfortable with having it removed and are confident then leave it alone.  It\u2019s entirely up to you if you choose to have a surgical procedure and you shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to do it by anyone!  You might want to rethink the depth of friendship between you and the bride though.  Having a mole on your face shouldn\u2019t be a reason to bar a true friend from standing by your side on your wedding day.  She sounds awful to me that she came to you with this that it\u2019s nonnegotiable and would be required for you to participate in her wedding!  Now if she had said something like \u201csweets you know I love you and your a knock out no matter what however have you considered having that removed I\u2019m just worried about your health or have you had a doctor look at it?\u201d  Now that\u2019s being a friend because she would be both supportive and worried about you at the same time.  My dad had skin cancer it presented a a mole on his forehead that he had removed because it grew and prevented him from wearing a hat!  Not the best reason to have surgery however if not for that he wouldn\u2019t have known it was cancer at all!", "NTA.  If you say yes, I hope you don\u2019t do it because of the wedding, photos, or to make the bride happy.  Do it only because you considered doing it before you ever had this conversation. \n\nIf YOU want the mole out of the photos, the wedding photographer can easily photoshop it out. Another option is to use \u201cburn makeup\u201d to cover it up. There are a surprising number of people out there in the wild who use burn make up to cover areas of skin. Perhaps talk to both a plastic surgeon and a commercial make up artist about options before making a decision.", "NTA  Don't be in the wedding and I suspect that down the road somewhere she won't even be a friend anymore.  Her ask is a total asshole move.  I have a mole on my cheek and one by my eyebrow.  I've considered having them removed and a dermatologist recommended NOT removing them because of the scarring it could cause.  I've been married twice, and never in any of my wedding photos did I think \"god, those moles look so awful and really ruined all the pictures!\".", "NTA. \n\nHas Zoe never heard of photoshop?\n\nWhat you decide to do -- or not do -- with your mole is your business. If you're comfortable with her offer, go for it. If not, she'll have to accept your decision. \n\nWhat is it with brides demanding their bridesmaids make such drastic changes? Change your hair color. Cut your hair. Get your brows microbladed. Lose 30 pounds. My answer to any of that nonsense would be \"No, thanks. I'm happy to just be a guest.\"", "Info: In what world does someone think it is okay for someone to request someone else to get plastic surgery to be physically good-looking enough to be in photos nobody will care about in five years. \n\nOP, ask your friend what happens if there are complications from the surgery? Will she provide ongoing financial support until it's been resolved? If the surgery is done and she still doesn't like how you look, will she kick you out of the wedding then?", "NTA.  Asking for someone to modify their body, in particular with a surgical procedure, for wedding photos is insane.  And she basically just insulting you too.  She is not a true friend.\n\nIf you want to get your mole removed, do it on your terms.  You deserve better than this so-call friend.  And you are very kind in the way you speak about her, more than I would be tbh.", "Your friend is an asshole for asking this of you. But If it is something you would like removed, then I say do it on her dime, but insist on a plastic surgeon. \n\nThey will do the best job of removing it with minimal scarring. \n(Kelo-cote is a great gel to put on afterward)\n\nI had a large mole on my cheek removed in my 20s.  It is a relatively simple and quick procedure. They did a local anaesthetic, you are awake but don\u2019t feel any pain. \n\nI have skin that scars easily but you would no idea I had a mole removed between the good plastic surgeon and the kelo cote gel.", "NTA & don\u2019t do it just because she wants a certain aesthetic for photos. What an jackhole.\nIf you want it done bc you want to, is something else.", "OMG. NTA. The mole is part of you, and you are beautiful.\n\nZoe does not deserve your friendship. She\u2019s treating you as a prop for her wedding. Decline the surgery - and the bridesmaid invitation. Spend your braid money on a nice weekend getaway or spa treatment.", "NTA. That\u2019s not your friend, that\u2019s a psychopath.", "NTA! This is an INSANE ask of somebody. Like, where does she get the nerve?? But, if you have wanted to do it, and she\u2019s lying for it, go ahead.", "you would not be an asshole either way but I'd take the free upgrade if I was you", "Is this real? Is she really that much of a shallow AH? \n\nHere\u2019s what I would do: let her pay for the mole removal if you decide you want it. Then skip the wedding and the friendship. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Zoe is a evil b for even suggesting it. Seriously who says that to someone they call a friend. I\u2019d say you know what, my mole and I will not be attending your wedding.", "Nta \nBut honestly if you hate the mole then look at it as a free removal", "Aye aye aye\u2026what am I reading? Your \u201cfriend\u201d is TA for asking you to undergo an operation to change your appearance to her liking. \n\nNow, if the mole is something you are insecure about and YOU want to have it removed - do so at another time so you won\u2019t be beholden to your \u201cfriend.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m so sorry this happened to you, OP. I\u2019d drop out of the wedding and ditch this friend.", "NTA - LET put aside the fact that anyone who asked you that to remove a body part is mandatory to be be apart of a wedding- AFTER already getting your hopes up - IS NOT YOUR FRIEND and the fact you are already insure about it it just so disgusting  - like I wouldn't say torch the friendship but like drop it and hangout with others- not her anymore \n\nNow on to the man part - Moles are kinda of finicky- removing it if there is a worry that it might become cancer is a big thing- \n\nMany people have had to have these spots removed for that very reason so it a common practice and not something you should be scared of - the longer you wait the longer it will have to heal - If this is a procedure YOU want then take your not friend money and get it done as long as there's no strings attached- it the least she can do for being a shit person \n\nNow if this isn't about health and you just don't know how to feel about it - like you secretly thing it gives your face character- and you only don't like it because of other peeps - then don't-\n\nThis is YOUR FACE - you are going to have to live with it so ONLY do what you want - anybody who tries to say otherwise is stright up trash and not worth your time and life", "NTA, thats fucking nuts.", "NTA. Can\u2019t believe she boldly told you that she requires you to physically alter yourself for a one-day-only event in order to be part of it. I\u2019d let her pay for it if I wanted and then ghost her. \n\nBut tbh, you should be like \u201cI would rather not be in the wedding of someone who doesn\u2019t accept and love me for me.\u201d \n\nWhat an entitled, selfish woman", "NTA.  You do not need to mutilate your body to please anyone.  She sounds like a control freak.  If this is a deal breaker for her, then let her make the decision now so she has time to find that 'perfect' face.\n\n\\> and that the mole on my face would be a distraction, and that I wouldn't look good in the photos\n\nThat's quite the exaggeration", "NTA, that's disrespectful asf to ask of you. but if you want the mole gone? damn, free mole removal, i say let her pay for it if you want it done anyway. otherwise, tell her no fucking way because asking someone to undergo aurgery just to look a certain way in your pictures is HORRIBLE", "NTA. IF YOU want it off then I say go for it. Have her pay for it then DROP OUT OF THE WEDDING! She isn\u2019t your friend!", "NTA - But, damn, take her up on it! It's a 2 minute outpatient procedure. Why would you not?", "NTA. She essentially told you that you don't look good. WTF. Asking somebody to have a surgical procedure in order to be a bridesmaid is absolutely bonkers. The audacity!", "Can we stop enabling brides to act like fucking psychos because 'they just want the perfect day'.\nWhat an asshole. Are you sure she is your friend?\nNTA but I'd seriously be questioning why you are friends with this person.", "NTA aside from all the other comments (who throughoutly explain why that is a horrible thing to ask of a friend) let me tell you this: This is an operation. It leaves a scar. You will be in a bit of pain. This is not only an issue of her saying \"oh I want you to cut your hair because I hate your haircut\" (which would already make her an AH), but it involves permanent alterations!! \nI got two moles removed nearly a year ago and have no idea into which category yours fall but one of mine had to be cut out and it took months to feel normal and there is still a big scar! I don't regret it because I wanted this, but do not do this just for someone else.", "This is an unjustifiable request, especially in the days of photoshop.  You want it removed for the photos, great, it'll take a decent photographer about 15 seconds per photo to remove that.  \n\nIt's also incredibly superficial.  If you've thought about having it removed and want to do it on her dime, but what got me was when she said it was a requirement for being a bridesmaid.  Weddings have gotten insane over the last few decades.

Then remove her from your list of people you give your time and energy to. \n\nI suggest you make a post publicly about it because even though she took you aside privately, I guarantee she will talk crap about you behind your back if/when you decline as bridesmaid and has also said negative things about your appearance to other people. Anyone who has the audacity to demand that you get cosmetic surgery for her own stupid selfish superficial reasons when it is your body, will not be being kind when you aren\u2019t around either. Offering money to pay for the surgery doesn\u2019t make anything about this a kind gesture.", "It took me about 5 minutes to read this and then to compose myself for an answer. You are nta. Your friend is a ginormous one though. She's asking for you to remove a part of your body for a wedding. Re read that last sentence again op. If you want surgery to remove it (I've had such a procedure done) then you should do it with your own time and money. That's not a friend you have and I guarantee she'll find some reason to ask for the money back at some later date. Remove only if you want not because you're trying to please someone else. Ditch the friend.", "NTA\u2026. But if you\u2019re thinking of getting it done may as well let someone else foot the bill for you . Unless you also are rich and have no issues paying for it.

Just Will add I found most wedding photographers will touch up and edit photos but not full on photoshop. So I wouldn\u2019t expect them To remove it, but you shouldn\u2019t ask that of them Anyway.

I always take extra strength Tylenol before I go, then they inject some lidocaine and epinephrine to numb any pain and stop it from bleeding. Then they remove the mole. I highly suggest (as others have stated) that you have it removed by a plastic surgeon OF YOUR CHOOSING. Don\u2019t let your friend pick. Pick a doctor you will be comfortable with and feel is competent.\n\nI had a dark mole like skin tag on my shoulder as long as I could remember and it was decently sized.

OP, you are beautiful and perfect and uniquely you. Your friend is acting like a total AH (and other things that would probably get me banned if I said them).", "Also, Zoe's request is flat-out unrealistic. Removing moles doesn't always make the area where the mole was invisible.

They couldn\u2019t do stitches because there simply wasn\u2019t any skin to stitch together. I\u2019ve kept it out of the sun and followed all healing instructions, but there\u2019s still a 1/2\u201d circle of a different color where the mole was. \n\nMy husband has had 10+ moles removed, some by plastic surgeons, and there\u2019s scars at every spot.

I was massively insecure about it until my twenties. There was an occasion, when I was getting it checked medically, that I was offered removal surgery. \n\nMy first thought was \"maybe my (awful) boyfriend will treat me better if I have it cut off\". That was the exact thought that knocked some sense into me. I realised that nobody deserves to feel as if they should CUT A CHUNK OF THEIR FACE OFF in order to deserve kindness from somebody else. I kept the birthmark and lost the boyfriend, and my self esteem went up from there.\n\nThis person is not a friend. I'm disgusted for you.\n\nIf you want the surgery for you, OP, then there is nothing wrong with that decision. However, it needs to be something you genuinely want for you and you're not motivated by the nasty comments she made. Take your time over this and speak to a plastic surgeon if you're considering it, but don't feel as if you have to do it to be treated properly by someone else.", "> I came here to say this.

Bride is frickin nuts and not someone I would even talk to again after that. Who volunteers someone else for surgery for a damn picture?

Even if i were already thinking about having my mole removed, just the sheer rudeness and audacity of the bride demanding this of me would be enough to make me refuse. Then i guess she'd kick me out of the wedding and make a big drama out of it. And then after the drama is all over ... i'd go and have my mole removed, because i wanted to do it, not because some superficial twit demanded it.", "especially since most photographers could minimize the appearance of the mole during touchups", "Make sure you get a check from her (or something, I'm old so I say check...) because she's an awful person and I can see her refusing to pay after you visit a plastic surgeon.

If it's on the face, find a plastic surgeon who will be just as focused on, and skilled at, maintaining the artistry and symmetry of OP's face as they are with removal of the mole.\n\nYup. I had a dermatologist remove a mole from my face because it would get tight and painful sometimes. It wound up leaving a dark spot in its place. \n\nIt's faded now, but at the time it was dark enough that a lady dying my hair thought she'd dripped onto my face somehow. \n\nFortunately, I never cared. Kinda liked it, actually. But if you're getting something removed from your face just for appearances? Go to plastics.", "Different strokes for different folks.\n\nLast year a growth showed up on my face (non-cancerous).  I would be ecstatic if a friend took me out and offered to have it removed.\n\nNo shit I know it looks bad.  There are things that look objectively bad.  People should be stoked as fuck that someone is willing to pay for them to improve their looks.\n\nPeople just need to get past their ego's, reddit users are so fucking thin skinned.", "Lots of factors play into that like size, location, removal method so it is difficult to say with that information.  For something small, most likely. If it requires a large incision,  maybe. Depends on how much time is in between. For my small removals, it was back to normal in a couple of weeks.  I had to have a very large precancerous area removed and that took months to get back to normal. It was just red and angry looking for a while, but fairly easy to cover with makeup.

My best friend has been trying for years to get a (slight) breast reduction. Her back goes out sometimes due to the weight. But insurance is being a dick about covering it (lose xx lbs first. Oh\u2026 well now lose xx more. Oh\u2026 well now it\u2019s not gonna affect your back right??) so if I had the money, I would offer to cover it for her. ONLY because she already wants (needs) it.

That surgery isn\u2019t cheap! She\u2019d be better off just laying the photographer to use photoshop if she\u2019s that fucking put off by it.\n\nObviously it\u2019s up to yourself (I had a mole removed from my cheek around 7 years ago, it wasn\u2019t huge, just big enough to cause me a lot of stress. But it wasn\u2019t major surgery, it was incredibly simple and there\u2019s the tiniest of unnoticeable scars left. Like a small freckle.).

The likes of which will be talked about for years to come. I\u2019d get it removed (not like you haven\u2019t thought about it or love it enough to highlight it on purpose) gso your so-called \u2018friend\u2019 can feel that your facial feature won\u2019t ruin her wedding photos. Let her pay for it as she\u2019s offered, as I said,it\u2019s not cheap.  Turn up on the day with a change of clothes, mention that you\u2019re surprised she didn\u2019t have her nose done since she was wanting everyone to look great in the pics, tell her to shove that up her ass with her bridesmaids dress and walk out having changed into something that gives you a boost (dress, hoodie, you do you) leave the bridesmaids dress in the bathroom or dump it on a seat as you leave and when she lifts it up she can see the huge big hairy mole face you\u2019ve drawn on it with a sharpie! Let her try to look fabulous in her wedding photos with puffy eyes and snotty nose. \n\nBut that\u2019s just me lol\n\nSeriously though, telling you that you\u2019d look wonderful of only \u2018X\u2019 was different is not a friend thing to do. It\u2019s never complimentary.  She\u2019ll ask you to be her bridesmaid but make it conditional on you having elective surgery to remove something that is a part of your skin, that can if so required, be covered with makeup or edited out of photos!  Ditch her, she\u2019s not a friend. Definitely not a smart one. Who even says things like that to people??\n\nAnyway, NTA", "She is definitely not your friend.", "If it were me and I had wanted to have the mole removed I would 100% have the friend pay for it, play along until about a week before and then back out of the wedding and never speak to her again.\n\nOP - Your friend is awful, and I'm sorry she thought this was an OK thing to ask of someone. I think you are better off without someone this ugly in your life, and whatever you choose to do, I hope you make sure she knows it's unacceptable. NTA.", "Theres god damn makeup, too! \n\nBut even still, its someones face and who she is. I would be disgusted if a \u201cfriend\u201d asked me to do this.", "> Just Will add I found most wedding photographers will touch up and edit photos but not full on photoshop.\n\n\nIt's the same thing. The buttons they're pressing to touch up the photos are right next to the one that would remove blemishes or small imperfections. You could probably remove it using a photo app on a phone nowadays it's become so common.", "I can also relate to this. I absolutely used to hate my nose and thought it was too big and knobby.\nI hated it to the point that as a teenager I decided I would get a nose job as soon as I'm old enough and can afford it.\nI never did get the nose job and I'm really glad I didn't. Because now I like my nose. It fits my face. It's my nose and no beauty standard gets to tell me it's ugly.\n\nAnd I bet the mole op has isn't even ugly or detracts from her face. It is probably just a case of AH like the 'friend' telling her that.\nAnd any wedding that requires you to undergo plastic surgery to be allowed to attend isn't worth going to", "Then get it removed, be in the wedding, then ditch Zoe.
