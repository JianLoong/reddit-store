I am excited for the wedding and am doing everything I can to help her out with planning and setting up.\n\nRecently, Zoe asked me out for coffee, away from the other bridesmaids, as she said that she wanted to talk to me about something privately. I agreed and asked her if something was wrong. She said it was nothing huge and she just wanted to talk to me.\n\nI met up with Zoe the other day, like she asked. It was there that she told me that she wanted me to get the mole on my face removed before the wedding. I have a mole on my right cheek, kind of near my nose. It's not huge, but it's definitely noticeable. Zoe explained that she wanted everyone to look good in the wedding photos as well as on the wedding day (understandable), and that the mole on my face would be a distraction, and that I wouldn't look good in the photos. She said that she would pay for the surgery out of pocket, as she could afford it, and all I would have to do is go in and get it removed. I told her that I needed time to think about it. She said she understood, but let me know that it would be mandatory for me to have the procedure in order to be a bridesmaid. I said that I would get back to her.\n\nI'm really conflicted on this because I have had times where I've been insecure about my mole, and Zoe wasn't lying when she said that it distracts from my face. So, if she was asking me to remove it, it may be better in the long run, AND she's paying for it. However, I don't really know if I want such a procedure done to my face, which is why I'm thinking about not going through with it. But Zoe is my friend, and more importantly, she's the bride and I want her to have the best day, which is why I think I may be the asshole if I didn't go through with it. Would I be wrong if I didn't get the mole on my face removed?", "created_utc": 1695992301, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16vazev/wibta_if_i_didnt_get_a_mole_removed_for_my/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Whilst it's kind to pay for something she knows you have had insecurities about attaching that condition is wildly inappropriate.\n\nI would honestly consider asking another bridesmaid what they thought about it.

Don\u2019t do it because someone you have trusted and really cared about it says you need to for your looks to be okay, in the form of an ultimatum.

OP- if you truly WANT this mole removed ( I had one removed from my face for personal reasons, so I completely understand your conflicting feelings) AND she is going to pay for it at the best surgeon you can find.. I would say go for it, then at the last minute - don't show up for her shitshow wedding. I can't imagine having the audacity to tell a friend, or anyone for that matter, that they aren't coming to an event because their natural face will ruin photos. Id be tempted to ruin their face with my fist if I heard that conversation. \n\nSo, if you want it done for you, and you feel comfortable with the doctor and everything, sure- let this sociopath pay for it, and let her believe you'll be there, then flake on everything you can last minute because she sounds like the mother of all assholes.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
