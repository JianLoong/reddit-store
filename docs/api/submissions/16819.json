Their desire to use yours - for whatever reason - is irrelevant the moment that use impinges on your ability to complete your work. \n\nAnd this issue is higher than your paygrade, or AITA's.

I mean, if you're feeling generous, you can share when you feel like it.

They are being incredibly entitled thinking that they can just use your assistive technology whenever. You were being kind letting them (and it sounds like you didn\u2019t want to but felt awkward saying no) and now they\u2019re just taking advantage of you. I\u2019m really sorry this is a sticky situation but I would tell them that you need it for work and it\u2019s not intended to be used in the way they are using it.

Its harmless convenience for them, just show them that you understand that its easier but they have other resources, and they are not blind.", "NTA, you need to go to your manager and loop them in on what is happening.

Employees are typically the largest expense for a government agency. Let them choose whether to buy an extra set-up or have people take longer to do these tasks. If you're right and it's too expensive, they will say no. That way, if people complain you can refer to management and say they OK'd the extra time.", "NTA, for now your coworkers are TA's because they're distracting you from your work. However, I wonder how much more expensive your software is.

You should keep record of how often people are trying to guilt you into letting them use YOUR tools, and how much of your time is being sacrificed/wasted by them doing so. Their lateness & laziness is not your responsibility to make up for. This is a huge issue that should be reported to your higher up, even if you describe that person as rather hands-off. Your co-workers are using you & disadvantaging you, and that behavior must be stopped. Don't worry so much about their feelings, because clearly they do not care about yours. YOU were granted the assistive technology, not them, and you're not the one responsible for the fact that the funding is not there for them to get their own versions of the tool. Swapping the assistive technology out for something else, it would never be acceptable for your colleagues to, for example, commandeer someone's electric wheelchair because it makes a task easier for them. The tools you have are yours, and no one else's. Simple as that. And standing up for yourself is never rude.", "Report this to HR NTA", "NTA. Sounds like you worked with a large group of lazy people.
