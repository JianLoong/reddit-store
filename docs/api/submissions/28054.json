The first 20 years had been excellent, but in the last few years, we grew apart. I wanted to embrace life to the fullest, taking more risks now that our children had left the house. Lucy, however, didn't share my newfound zest for life, and three years ago, I made the difficult decision to ask for a divorce.   \n\n\nOur children, L (25M) and G (23M), took the news surprisingly well, but it was particularly hard for Emily (21F).Lucy had been a stay-at-home wife, dedicating her time to volunteering, while I was the primary breadwinner with my own consultancy. I ensured Lucy was well taken care of in the divorce \u2013 she got the family home and a substantial payout.  \n\n\nIn these past few years, I've immersed myself in travel, exercise, and the sheer joy of living. I maintained a cordial relationship with Lucy, always there to lend a hand when she needed it, knowing she was struggling with the changes. For the last 2 years, I've been dating my secretary, Bianca (33F). Our connection was genuine, born from a shared passion for art and a mutual love for travel. Six months ago, we decided to live together. I introduced her to my children as my girlfriend, and while my sons accepted her warmly, Emily openly expressed her disapproval, being disrespectful and rude towards Bianca. She voiced her disappointment, accusing me of \"leaving her mother for a young gold digger.\"  \n\n\nOur discussions have primarily involved me saying, \"I understand that this has been incredibly hard for you. I want you to know that my love for you hasn't diminished in any way. But I have a right to my own happiness, and I need you to not be hostile towards Bianca.\"I've made significant efforts to bridge the gap with Emily, but she was previously okay. Since Bianca moved in, she has been openly hostile. She left Bianca's birthday celebration and called her a gold digger in front of everyone after I purchased Bianca a Range Rover for her 33rd birthday.  \n\n\nThis behavior is unacceptable. I pay for Emily's college, rent, and provide a stipend so she can focus on studying and not working. I believe I now need to consider cutting off her stipend, but I don't want to further ruin our relationship.  \n\n\nTL;DR: I divorced my exwife, finds happiness with new partner. Daughter's hostility strains relationship, considering financial cutoff.", "created_utc": 1696230669, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xpxm5/aita_if_i_stop_paying_for_my_daughters_living/", "score": 200, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Number two, it literally sounds like the plot to a trashy romance novel.\n\nAnd you filed for divorce 3 years ago, then started publicly dating Bianca 2 years ago. How dumb do you think we are?

The first 20 years had been excellent, but in the last few years, we grew apart. I wanted to embrace life to the fullest, taking more risks now that our children had left the house. Lucy, however, didn't share my newfound zest for life, and three years ago, I made the difficult decision to ask for a divorce. Our children, L (25M) and G (23M), took the news surprisingly well, but it was particularly hard for Emily (21F).  \nLucy had been a stay-at-home wife, dedicating her time to volunteering, while I was the primary breadwinner with my own consultancy. I ensured Lucy was well taken care of in the divorce \u2013 she got the family home and a substantial payout.  \nIn these past few years, I've immersed myself in travel, exercise, and the sheer joy of living. I maintained a cordial relationship with Lucy, always there to lend a hand when she needed it, knowing she was struggling with the changes. For the last 2 years, I've been dating my secretary, Bianca (33F). Our connection was genuine, born from a shared passion for art and a mutual love for travel. Six months ago, we decided to live together. I introduced her to my children as my girlfriend, and while my sons accepted her warmly, Emily openly expressed her disapproval, being disrespectful and rude towards Bianca. She voiced her disappointment, accusing me of \"leaving her mother for a young gold digger.\"  \nOur discussions have primarily involved me saying, \"I understand that this has been incredibly hard for you. I want you to know that my love for you hasn't diminished in any way. But I have a right to my own happiness, and I need you to not be hostile towards Bianca.\"  \nI've made significant efforts to bridge the gap with Emily, but she was previously okay. Since Bianca moved in, she has been openly hostile. She left Bianca's birthday celebration and called her a gold digger in front of everyone after I purchased Bianca a Range Rover for her 33rd birthday. This behavior is unacceptable. I pay for Emily's college, rent, and provide a stipend so she can focus on studying and not working. I believe I now need to consider cutting off her stipend, but I don't want to further ruin our relationship.  \nTL;DR: I divorced my exwife, finds happiness with new partner. Daughter's hostility strains relationship, considering financial cutoff.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019have much more respect for new SO who show patience, love and kindness to show their respect and get gradually accepted, and it always takes time.", "They aren\u2019t but he can write it off on his taxes if he registered it to his company because of the weight.", "He just happened to divorce Mom the second he wouldn't be on the hook for child support. Crazy timing, that.", "I wish I could give you an award. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\ude02", "I don't know these people but I find it pretty disrespectful to call Bianca a gold digger at her own birthday party. If she is angry it should be directed to her dad.", "Shit maybe. Depends on the situation. I\u2019d wager OP is paying for an expensive school. Also that if he was in your country and his daughter held onto her current mindset, then he\u2019d end up in the cheapest old folks home she could find. If that\u2019s a possibility where you\u2019re from I wouldn\u2019t call that a fair trade \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Often gold diggers blame kids on being financially draining their father, but for me, as a parent, it\u2019s a moral duty to support your children through college, specially if you can easily financially do it. After divorce and trauma, statically, more kids drop off from college, what is the point to increase financial insecurity?", "All schools are fairly affordable here (even have people from neighbouring countries come here to study because it's cheaper than their own). And our care homes are getting more expensive (200 euros more expensive in just a year's time, you pay 1800 euros for a shared room in an old folks home here, while average pensions are 1000-1500 a month) so it's honestly more of a burden on the children (considering it's their wages that pay for the current pensions, and thus their parent's pensions).\n\nThere are still ways you can screw your children up here. For example parents here receive a stipend from the government for each child. It's a small amount every month to help cover child care costs. Now if your child happens to work in the weekends and make over a certain amount of money in a quarter, you are obligated to return the stipend for that quarter to the government.   \nIn my case, my parents got the stipend, didn't give it to me (I had to cover my own tuition, and I was too young to know my rights back in the day and too stressed out to navigate the fucked up bureaucracy we have here) and when I earned too much (20 euros over the limit) I had to pay back the stipend since I was already an adult, without seeing that money ever as my parents still received it and not me.\n\nNow I could have gone the judicial way and get that money back from them, but it would cost money and take a lot of time and soured my relationship with them even more than it already had so I didn't and cut my losses.\n\nBut if you know your rights and have the right connections, or the money, you can definitely force your parents to take care of you until you're 25 here.", "What you describe with the stipend situation applies in the US as well with children in foster care. A lot of people who are terrible parents are paid to \u201cparent\u201d and keep the stipends to pay their own bills and feed their kids rice and cup of noodles, while they eat whatever they want. There\u2019s no legal recourse for that here though. Also I looked into quite a few European schools as a high schooler(secondary for you I guess), and it\u2019s definitely not affordable for a lot of people. The exception being Germany with their transfer grants for people who learn the native language. I\u2019m a mailman, and I can say with absolute certainty that if I stay in my job there\u2019s absolutely no way I could pay for my child to attend college in Europe or anywhere else. They will have to take loans or earn grants academically, like the vast majority of \u201clower class\u201d citizens.", "Yeah but the thing here is that we're still cheaper than our neighbour (The Netherlands) and for natives receiving a grant is quite common (since a lot of people's incomes fall at least partially under the threshold to receive it).", "Well that does sound nice. California is not so kind. A mailman\u2019s salary won\u2019t pay for anything higher than community college here but it will disqualify your child from receiving help from the state."]}
