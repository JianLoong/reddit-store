I didnt give my ungratful neice a 300$ present?\n\nSo recently, I (32F) bought a few presents for my neices birthday, which was a few days ago. My neice is 11, and shes been wanting this almost 300$ thing. It was expensive, but I had been saving up for it because I thought she had deserved it. She's been doing good in school and good at home.\n\nAnyways, I got to her party, and I had left the toyhome. It was going to be a surprise i could give her after her party, since I checked with everybody else getting her a gift and nobody was getting what I got. I thought this was a great plan. I bring my little gift bag of a few things she liked (to be specific, a few candy bars and a 20$ gift card) and give it to her when it was time to open the gifts. She opened it, and looked at me in an annoyed way. \"This is all you got me? Just candys bars and a goft card?\" I was shocked by what she said. I was debating on whether I should give her her other present, but she had been extremely rude, so I decided to hold on.\n\nI pulled her mom aside, and told her I was gonna wait until christmas, or maybe her next birthday to give her the gift because my neice had been rude. She asked me \"Why cant you just give it to her now? You already bought it.\" I told her it was because her daughter was rude, and i didnt feel like giving it to her today. My sister got mad, and told me to leave the party then. I shrugged, and left.\n\nOnce I got home, i put the unopened box in my basement. I checked my phone, and my sister had called me an asshole for not giving my neice the car. I responded that her neice was rude, and I didnt feel like giving a rude eleven year old an expensive toy right now. My sister and my mom say i should just give her the toy, and im staying firm.

I would consider returning the gift and getting your money back.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your niece needs to learn how to accept gifts with grace even if it\u2019s not what she expected or wanted. I feel like kids are generally taught very young to immediately say thank you after opening a gift and not to criticize gifts they don\u2019t like. It\u2019s part of basic manners she should be just as ingrained as saying thank you when you ask someone to hand you something.\n\nThis behavior at 11 is entirely inappropriate and you are absolutely right to not give her the present. Even a 5 yr old should have had to apologize for being rude before receiving the gift. \n\nIf I were you I would take it a step further and tell your niece that you had purchased  the car and chose not to give it to her because of her poor manners. Tell her you returned it to the store. Give it to her when she behaves better.", "NTA   \n\n\nIf your sister wants to raise and entitled asshole, and your mother is cosigning off on that, they can deal with it.  You are under no obligation to buy into their nonsense.", "NTA\n\nUntil a gift is given, it's not theirs. I'd return it", "Nta she needs to learn, bad behaviour doesn\u2019t get rewarded. \n\nYears ago during a holiday my grandmother gave one of my younger cousins a gift she didn\u2019t like. The little brat literally threw it at the floor and said she didn\u2019t want it. Everyone was so taken aback by her reaction. My grandmother is the sweetest thing and didn\u2019t get mad, but felt embarrassed cause she felt it was her fault for buying the wrong gift. All my aunties had bought gifts for all the grandkids aswell, but my cousin\u2019s mum asked her sisters not to give anything to her daughter. So my younger cousin had to watch while all of us did get more gifts to unwrap. She was crying and trying to plead to get her gifts, which made some of my aunties feel bad and they wanted to give her their gifts anyway, but her mum didn\u2019t allow it. Now that cousin is 13 and you could literally gift her a wet sock and she will still be gracious and grateful. She learned.", "Don't give it at Christmas either.  Her mom seems like the person to tell your niece to expect it. When she doesn't get it again she'll prolly be equally as rude. \"Apparently you haven't learned humility and appreciating the kindness of others nor not to be entitled. I actually got u xxx for your last birthday but you were incredibly rude so I didn't give it you, apparently your mother didn't discuss it with you and teach you values, I'll be returning it now....then return it. \n\nIf niece isn't rude the tell them you forgot one in the car and then give it to her.", "Nope-NTA. An 11 year old is old enough to show some basic graciousness. I would return it, and be sure she knows that you\u2019ve returned the gift due to her reaction to the token gift, it was clear to you that she wouldn\u2019t have handled the gift well. \n\nGlad someone (you) is at least teaching her how to be a kind, caring type of person.", "NTA. Rudeness has consequences.", "I would have told her that she blew it and got my money back for the gift. Actions have consequences and at that age, she should be aware of it. NTA.", "NTA. Your money, if you want you can return the gift. You are in no way obligated to give the gift to your niece.", "Nope. Not the AH. My kids (8yo) sometimes say shit like that. And I don\u2019t hesitate to point out that they are acting like an entitled little brat. I tell them that they aren\u2019t entitled to a goddamn thing. And they get what they earned through behavior and actions. As well as what my parents would have done if I was in there situation. (Ah, growing up poor in the 80\u2019s when beating your children, was the norm and thought of as good parenting.)\u2026 definitely not the AH. Sorry to hear your family is raising an entitled little brat. Good for you on standing your ground and keeping your boundaries.", "NTA. I can see where your niece got her rudeness. And your mom needs to mind her manners as well. Not rewarding bad behavior is not an asshole thing to do. \n\nIf that were my child, I would be horrified by her entitlement.", "NTA. Don't give it to her at Christmas, just return it. She's behaving like a greedy, spoiled brat and you are not required to take her shit.", "NTA. Niece is a brat and we can see why. Her mom and grandma are brats. When you get a gift you take it and say \"thank you.\" Her mother is raising her poorly. And they should not be pestering you to gift her anything. It's your choice.", "NTAH- you would be however IF you gave it to her. In fact MY AH move would be doing a livestream on her and Moms favorite social media showing ME returning the gift to the store for a refund - AND telling the clerk WHY I returned it. \nThat 300 would be better spent on something that helps underprivileged kids in shelters- toys, clothes, diapers- and that\u2019s EXACTLY how it would get spent- then driven to the nearest location accepting donations - I would ALSO live stream that part too- my making that donation in HER NAME . \nMaybe then her and Mom will learn a few lessons in humility, gratitude and appreciation!", "NTA\n\nYour niece was rude and entitled \n\nYour sister and mother are enabling her and probably have hinted that \u201cauntie might have gotten you something\u2026\u201d when the girl has been asking about her presents or hinting at what she wants in the time prior\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nthis does not excuse any of them\n\nI would sit niece down without her enablers around and explain why this happened and if she corrects it she may get it later", "NTA. In fact I would return it and give something else for Christmas. No one is entitled to a gift but everyone should not be so rude to family. She needs to gain some appreciation for things.", "NTA. If they won't parent their spoiled child/grandchild, then I guess it's on you. Now you could tell her you got her something expensive but her attitude lost it but that is counter productive, because she'll just lie expecting better presents. Getting something smaller acting entitled and having you leave and tell her you were disappointed in her behaviour could help a little.\n\nThe main thing though is if you get told \"that's it\" then coming back with an expensive gift you're straight up teaching her hey complain about everything and you'll get something better because you're super special and we must appease you, the absolute worst thing you could ever teach a kid.", "NTA.\n\n\nShe needs to learn to be greatful for what she has.", "How can you not see that you are all creating a monster here?", "Nope, I would have returned the gift .", "Nta", "NTA. That was really unacceptable behavior.", "Return it and get your money back. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb", "Or, you could return the gift and put the money aside for another day.", "NTA, donate it to someone more appreciative & have a photo op while doing so. Post the heck out of that!!", "NTA. It sucks that you\u2019re more inclined to teach her manners than her mother is. Return the gift and use the money to treat yourself for putting up with such assholery.", "NTA \n\nWith a mother like that no wonder your niece acts that way", "NTA. Just return the gift. You were playing a game with your niece that blew up in both your faces. Your sister, niece and mother seem to have entitlement issues.\n\nDon't go overboard with a gift next time.", "I agree absolutely that the kid was rude and I would die if one of my children behaved like that when given a gift, however why did you not just bring the gift to the party?  What game were you playing?  What you did makes no sense to me at all.", "NTA.   \n\n\nA gift is a gift. It\u2019s not a responsibility or demand.   \nYou gave her a gift and she was rude about it.   \nYou had a nicer gift at home but you have zero responsibility to give it to her, and she has zero right to demand it. A gift\u2026 is a gift.", "You know that entitlement runs from grandma to 2 generations down. NTA. Return it and treat yourself to something nice. I bet your sister didn't get you an expensive gift on your birthday", "You are not wrong. You work for the money that bought the gift. Stop the overpriced gift giving for your sister and her family, candy bars, and $20 gift cards for all. Wait and watch, I would bet money by Thanksgiving as Christmas lights go up. You will have a gushing loving sister and niece. All children reach an age of maturity when my family begins to pull back on expensive toys, later at graduations, weddings, etc. We then give large amounts to reward them for growth and maturity.  This is your family. You set the path . Her waiting won't hurt. Time will allow your family members to calm and possibly understand. But, if someone took the time to call me and message me that I'm an asshole, I think I'd do something for myself at the holidays, but simply let family know your regrets to miss occasions, no bitterness. Christmas tree air fresheners for all.", "Clearly against the grain, but ESH.", "Nta. Nice was greedy and rude. You accept what you're given gracefully.
