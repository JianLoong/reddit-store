I didnt give my ungratful neice a 300$ present?\n\nSo recently, I (32F) bought a few presents for my neices birthday, which was a few days ago.

She's been doing good in school and good at home.\n\nAnyways, I got to her party, and I had left the toyhome. It was going to be a surprise i could give her after her party, since I checked with everybody else getting her a gift and nobody was getting what I got. I thought this was a great plan. I bring my little gift bag of a few things she liked (to be specific, a few candy bars and a 20$ gift card) and give it to her when it was time to open the gifts. She opened it, and looked at me in an annoyed way. \"This is all you got me? Just candys bars and a goft card?\" I was shocked by what she said. I was debating on whether I should give her her other present, but she had been extremely rude, so I decided to hold on.\n\nI pulled her mom aside, and told her I was gonna wait until christmas, or maybe her next birthday to give her the gift because my neice had been rude. She asked me \"Why cant you just give it to her now? You already bought it.\" I told her it was because her daughter was rude, and i didnt feel like giving it to her today. My sister got mad, and told me to leave the party then. I shrugged, and left.\n\nOnce I got home, i put the unopened box in my basement. I checked my phone, and my sister had called me an asshole for not giving my neice the car. I responded that her neice was rude, and I didnt feel like giving a rude eleven year old an expensive toy right now. My sister and my mom say i should just give her the toy, and im staying firm.

It\u2019s part of basic manners she should be just as ingrained as saying thank you when you ask someone to hand you something.\n\nThis behavior at 11 is entirely inappropriate and you are absolutely right to not give her the present. Even a 5 yr old should have had to apologize for being rude before receiving the gift. \n\nIf I were you I would take it a step further and tell your niece that you had purchased  the car and chose not to give it to her because of her poor manners.

The little brat literally threw it at the floor and said she didn\u2019t want it. Everyone was so taken aback by her reaction. My grandmother is the sweetest thing and didn\u2019t get mad, but felt embarrassed cause she felt it was her fault for buying the wrong gift. All my aunties had bought gifts for all the grandkids aswell, but my cousin\u2019s mum asked her sisters not to give anything to her daughter. So my younger cousin had to watch while all of us did get more gifts to unwrap. She was crying and trying to plead to get her gifts, which made some of my aunties feel bad and they wanted to give her their gifts anyway, but her mum didn\u2019t allow it. Now that cousin is 13 and you could literally gift her a wet sock and she will still be gracious and grateful. She learned.", "Don't give it at Christmas either.

If they won't parent their spoiled child/grandchild, then I guess it's on you. Now you could tell her you got her something expensive but her attitude lost it but that is counter productive, because she'll just lie expecting better presents. Getting something smaller acting entitled and having you leave and tell her you were disappointed in her behaviour could help a little.\n\nThe main thing though is if you get told \"that's it\" then coming back with an expensive gift you're straight up teaching her hey complain about everything and you'll get something better because you're super special and we must appease you, the absolute worst thing you could ever teach a kid.", "NTA.\n\n\nShe needs to learn to be greatful for what she has.", "How can you not see that you are all creating a monster here?", "Nope, I would have returned the gift .", "Nta", "NTA.

When I was a teacher, I had the kids practice the fuck out of saying thank you and being gracious, especially during holidays with gifts.

This little shit have so much attitude because \u201cthat\u2019s all I get? This tiny piece?\u201d So he didn\u2019t get any. Not when he begged. Not when he threw a tantrum.

You had been saving up for this expensive gift (apparently a  kid's car, although it is very unclear from your story), you had made elaborate plans to surprise your niece, you put together a ruse gift, and then you FORGOT the real gift??? Really? YTA for making up such an unbelievable story.", "NTA. Don\u2019t give it to her. She needs to learn some manners. Unfortunately she doesn\u2019t realize what she did, so I think you tell her \u201cI bought you (gift) for your bday and was going to give it to you after the party, but because of how rude you were to me I am returning it.\u201d You don\u2019t actually have to return it, she just has to think you did so she understands the repercussions of what she did. This is a teaching moment for you and learning moment for her.", "NTA. She was obnoxious and didn't deserve an expensive gift when she couldn't even pretend to be grateful for the small gift.  \nTell you mom and sister you heard their opinions, but you have made your decision and you're not going to discuss it any more.  Say the same thing every single time the topic comes up.", "NTA.  Return the gift and make a donation to a children\u2019s charity in your niece\u2019s name.  The charity will send her a note letting her know.

Hopefully this turns into a learning lesson. Please give us an update.", "NTA. Return it. Your niece is spoiled and sneered ay your gift. Candy bars and  a $20 gift card should be her gifts forever. You could mix it up with a nice gift balm sometimes", "NTA. And the entitlement from your sister and niece is outrageous.", "Oh heck no. Take the toy back.", "NTA, and I would return it and going forward just give gift cards. \n\nI also would have had a really hard time not telling my sister that I guess we can see where niece learned her lessons in rude and entitled behavior. \n\nBut I probably would have just said I was extremely hurt at the way niece treated me, as if I were only worth her time and attention if I buy her expensive things, and her mother trying to bully me and calling me names isn't likely to make me feel very generous going forward.", "Nta", "Sure seems like nobody has manners these days. I should probably take a break from reddit. You however did tge right thing.  Nta", "NTA return it", "NTA but what is it lately with gifting children/young teens toys worth hundreds?

I would boycott all of them until they come forward and apologize.", "NTA.  11-year-old children do not deserve a $300 toy - regardless of how \"good\" they've been.  A computer - maybe - but not a toy.

I looked around and nobody had even noticed, so there I sat, wondering what I'd done wrong to not get a 'good' present. It wasn't until about an hour after all the gifts had been opened that I was asked, \"So what did you get?\" I said 'socks'.  \"And what else?\"  'Nothing'.  \"OMG!!\" My brother ran down the hall and disappeared for a minute, then came back with a big sled that had been to large to wrap and they'd forgotten about it.  I didn't raise a fuss over the socks, but I was very happy to see that sled.", "NTA\n\nDon't reward bad behavior with expensive gifts.\n\nShowing your niece that her entitled rudeness has immediate bad consequences is the very best gift you can give her. \n\nGood for you.", "Oh hell no!

So I guess you've come the right place?", "NTA although I think just not giving the gift is not going to teach her the valuable life lesson she needs to learn (she and her mom actually!) and have a suggestion. \n\nI think she needs to know that you did have mother gift but decided not to give it based on her behavior. I\u2019d say it in a very teachable way vs. a snarky way. Perhaps if she apologizes and expresses sincere regret you can then give it to her. If you tell her mom in advance the plan (that you will still give the gift with a sincere apology), maybe she will go along with it.", "YTA why are you trying to mess with a child and then punish her for it\n\nYou're weird", "NTA ofc your niece was rude and hella untitled", "NTA.

The parents were having fun after the main event and had put things like a banana or an avocado in the unwrapped boxes to give him to open. His genuine gratitude for each thing was precious. If a toddler can express sincere gratitude for a banana on Christmas, your niece can show gratitude for candy and gift cards. NTA", "NTA. Why reward rude behavior?", "I think that's what happened.\n\nThey tipped niece off about the bigger gift and set her expectation.\n\nI'm not saying she wasn't rude; but I think she was frustrated that she had been promised something bigger (albeit not by OP).\n\nNTA", "When I was turning 9, I was waiting for friends to show up for my party. I went for a walk with my dad and I can still remember me saying 'i wonder what they are going to give me'.

Like...what kind of a shitty lesson is that? Who makes a child sit and watch everybody else get gifts instead of just talking to them? Kids are rude and tactless and throw tantrums because they don't know any better, which is why they need to be taught, not punished.
