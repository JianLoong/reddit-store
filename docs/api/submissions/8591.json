We met at our old job but she got fired from there soon after we started dating (failing a drug test). Since then she's been jumping in between different jobs, apparently none were \"good enough\" for her so she keeps quitting each one after just a few months. But for the last 7-8 months she hasn't worked at all. She even stopped applying to jobs completely. \n\nNow for the car, about a year into our relationship I bought her a new car that I'm paying monthly for. Technically the car is legally mine, the only reason I bought it was because at the time she had a 1hr commute and her old car was crap. Even though the car and financing is in my name she used to pay for it from her salary. But now that she's been unemployed for several months I'm the one that has to pay for it. I also have to pay the whole rent and financing on my own car. I'm barely making ends meet. She only uses the car once or twice a week to go shopping or meet up with her friends. So a couple days ago I snapped and told her that if she doesn't get a job I'll take that car away and give it to my mom. And since I've said that my girlfriend has stopped talking to me and when she does she's extremely rude and aggressive. Also I just want to point out that I've even offered to find her a job, one of my friends is a manager at a small bakery and he said that he could hire my girlfriend. But she still refuses to work at all. On one side I feel like AH but on the other I can't afford all those bills.

You legally control it, but you admit that she was paying for it for quite a while. You both own that car, so even if you're legally able to do this it's still wrong.\n\nIf you don't respect her and the relationship isn't working, end the relationship and figure out how to handle the car. Make it her responsibility legally. Do not treat your adult partner like a child.", "NTA but make good on the threat. Give the car to your mother and move out of your shared place. It\u2019s not your job or your place to tell an adult to act like an adult. You\u2019ve given her plenty of time to get her life in order. Time to move on and learn a lesson from this relationship, which sounds like a dumpster fire.", "Time for a new GF.", "NTA - you bought the car so that she could get to work safely. If she isn't working then she doesn't need the car. And if she isn't pulling her weight at all, do you really need the gf?", "NTA. But it sounds like GF has some depression issues. I would give car to mom or sell it, but suggest therapy too. This situation won't solve itself and you've been more than reasonable. If you break up over it I think in the end you'll know it was for the best.", "Take the car back. She's using you financially and won't change until she is forced to do so. NTA", "NTA\n\nCar is in your name and she has been jobless and not paying for it for months. Take this as a clue as to what your life will be like if you continue in this relationship. Don't get her pregnant or this is your life for the foreseeable future.", "NTA", "NTA", "Info: what exactly does she bring to the relationship? Because I'd it's just sex, there are cheaper ways to go about it and some will actually act like they like you.", "NTA I dont see a future for this relationship, I mean, she's technically a burden", "NTA- Sell that car or give it to your mom and find a new girlfriend. She is doing nothing but using you and she won't change.", "NTA, time to end this.", "NTA-  why work when someone is paying everything for me?  You are being used and you need to open your eyes and realize it", "She goes out shopping? With what money?\n\nYou need to reconsider this whole relationship if you don't want a stay at home girlfriend.", "Welcome to the next (however long this relationship lasts) of your life.  She's shown you who she is.  She won't get a new job, she'll just abuse you until you're tired of her shit and you throw her out.  At which point she'll just find some other person to latch onto.\n\nSorry man, but you should just leave her.", "Kindve a lot of discrepancies in the story. 1- how long did she pay for the car with her salary? Because just taking the car would mean you got free payments out of her for the financing in your name. 2- how is she shopping if she doesnt have a job? Or going out with friends? Are you giving her money? \n\nSeems like everyones the asshole here. Need better communication over clear areas that are important to eachother loves. Stop thinking money through actions and discuss it.\n\nAlso.#3- is there 2 cars in this situation? Just sell 1 if you're having money issues.", "NTA.  Don't threaten, do.  The problem will solve itself.", "NTA She is a mooch and if your paying for the car... just put the loan and car in her name and then stop paying and it.. she either gets a job or it gets reprocessed.", "NTA. Make sure you have all of the car keys. Kick her out. This is not a relationship worth saving.", "NTA.  Your girlfriend is pissed because you made a clear boundary.  Boo hoo.  That's what adults do.  Give the car to your mom and let her make the payments if your girlfriend won't get a job and make the payments, and then find a girlfriend who will respect you and contribute to the relationship equally.  xx, Leslie", "Even if you generously assume she didn't have an intention to mooch off you, I hope you realize that the longer she is not working without any consequences to not working, the harder it will be for her to find a job...or keep one.\n\nHer gap in employment will just keep getting bigger.  And it's hard to look for work, especially if you're unemployed. It's unpleasant -- it's unusual to not get rejected in the process. With her growing gap in employment and streak of bouncing around, she will be asked unpleasant questions at interviews. \n\nAlso, you really can't afford that car on your income alone. You can't even afford to give it away.  And you certainly can't afford your girlfriend as she is right now.\n\nNTA", "This. A relationship is a partnership. Right now it seems like only one person is willing to pull the load.", "Lol, comment straight out of r/seducingwomen", "Um, yes; yes I did see that flag!", "Yes yes yes yes yes yes!!!!", "Thank God I live in Canada, where drug tests of the caliber in the US are unconstitutional.", "No, it's an obvious sign of employer overstepping what should be a hard line unless you're working with something like heavy machinery.", "Both are heavily regulated industries.", "With a lot of employers, it should be a hard line, and nothing said she wasn't working with machinery.", "Unrelated to the post (you're obviously NTA OP), but why are you financing two new cars when you are \"struggling to make ends meet\"? \n\nI understand that part of your poor financial status is due to having a deadbeat girlfriend, but come on dude. Has no-one in your life ever told you that taking on debt for a new vehicle is one of the worst financial decisions you can make? \n\nIMO (after you break up with your girlfriend ofc) you should sell both vehicles and buy yourself a car you can afford OUTRIGHT (do NOT take on more debt).", "NTA. \n\nAlso she\u2019s your girlfriend not your wife. Get rid of her.", "NTA, it seems evident that she is using you.", "Just sell it. Oh, and get the fuck out.", "Sounds like you need to ditch the girlfriend. She's dead weight if she's unwilling to contribute to the household when she's able to.", "ESH. Why are you still together? Just break up with her already, you clearly don\u2019t like being in this relationship", "NTA. Be careful she doesn't \"accidentally\" get pregnant, dude", "I\u2019d say YTA - bear with me - if you need to force your girlfriend to get a job and use financial coercion to make her into who you want her to be\u2026. That\u2019s coercive. You\u2019re an asshole for being controlling rather than just making a decision about whether you want to be with the person you\u2019re with. If you broke up with her and took the car with you I\u2019d say not the ass, but being financially manipulative / controlling is asshole stuff.", "NTA leave her. She's a leech that needs to be burnt off. Quit letting her use you. She's fine not doing anything because you're taking care of everything. End it.", "This guy dated this girl (met through her work). He has good job. He soon moves into her place & she quits work (childcare issues). So his \"can pay his bills\" job is now paying all her & her kids expenses. He keeps trying to get her to work. Nope. Few yrs & he's broke, credit trashed, he leaves. She immediately takes up with his best friend (dude knows she's a leach). Best friend married leach & she quits work & takes up a Mary Jane habit big time. He's already complaining...wonder how long til divorce? Guy reminded him again what a leach she is before they married.", "NTA sounds like you got a case of Gold Diggeritis.  I would give her the ultimatum of get a job or get out.  I would also give the car to your mom and have her assume payments on it.  Tell your GF that if she wants a car she will have to buy and pay for one herself.", "NTA\nGet out now", "YTA.  You made it sound like you can't afford her car but then said you'd give it to your mom... And how will she find work without transportation?  You got it for her, it's hers.", "NTA, please consider breaking up with her and taking the car with you.", "relationship sounds horrible. tough as it may seem short term, get out of there.", "NTA get out now and take the car. The relationship is over she is using you and was just eading you into paying for her life. I dont normally say this about people but thats clearly what shes doing", "Why do you want a child instead of a girlfriend? She sounds like me when I was about 16.", "First red flag...\"failed a drug test and got fired\"\nWhy are you still paying for her? What incentive does she have to get a job when you pay for her lifestyle? You aren't a sugar daddy ... you're a fool and NTA. .Take that car away", "YTA", "NTA - but the best thing OP can do for her is take away the car she is borrowing from him (it isn't her car) and probably if she doesn't appreciate that, then break up with her and let her have some time to grow up and mature.  This might be a huge blessing for OP, a nice clear red flag he can plainly see that gives him a chance to bail before things get too far.", "NTA", "NTA. You have a daughter, not a partner. You need someone in your life that understands that nothing is free. If she is to be a partner, she too must provide for the home in some fashion that you both agree to. \n\nShe has decided to be a parasite to you. I suggest sending your girlfriend on her way and letting your mom use the car. Life would be easier for you if you sold it though.", "NTA This relationship is not good for you. You need to reconsider it.\n\nAnd, if you've been depending on your gf for birth control, time to start using condoms YOU buy and keep safe, because a sudden pregnancy might happen. \n\n(And, if thinking about that makes you nervous, you should kick her out immediately, because it means you know deep down that a long term relationship with her and children will be toxic.)", "NTA why are you still there?", "If you think giving ultimatums and threats is ok, that it\u2019s going to magically make her bend over backwards and find a job all of a sudden, just leave.", "INFO is she still taking drugs, which might explain the apathy? Either way does not sound like this will get better.... NTA", ">you cannot make her into her potential.\n\nThis ought to be a bumper sticker.", "This is really good advice.

The car is in YOUR name. YOU bought it and are making payments on it, YOU get to do what you want with it.\n\nAlso, NGL, the GF sounds like a deadbeat. Maybe time to consider moving on.
