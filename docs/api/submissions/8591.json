We met at our old job but she got fired from there soon after we started dating (failing a drug test). Since then she's been jumping in between different jobs, apparently none were \"good enough\" for her so she keeps quitting each one after just a few months. But for the last 7-8 months she hasn't worked at all. She even stopped applying to jobs completely. \n\nNow for the car, about a year into our relationship I bought her a new car that I'm paying monthly for. Technically the car is legally mine, the only reason I bought it was because at the time she had a 1hr commute and her old car was crap. Even though the car and financing is in my name she used to pay for it from her salary. But now that she's been unemployed for several months I'm the one that has to pay for it. I also have to pay the whole rent and financing on my own car. I'm barely making ends meet. She only uses the car once or twice a week to go shopping or meet up with her friends. So a couple days ago I snapped and told her that if she doesn't get a job I'll take that car away and give it to my mom. And since I've said that my girlfriend has stopped talking to me and when she does she's extremely rude and aggressive. Also I just want to point out that I've even offered to find her a job, one of my friends is a manager at a small bakery and he said that he could hire my girlfriend. But she still refuses to work at all. On one side I feel like AH but on the other I can't afford all those bills.

If you want your life to change, you have to do something different, like moving out & letting your girlfriend fend for herself.

The fact that she got angry and became rude, aggressive and is giving you (who is taking care of her like she\u2019s your child) the silent treatment like a temperamental teenager spells break up to me.

Your gf is refusing to take any responsibility in the family finance and you are trying to raise your gf.\n\nYou can't raise your gf. If she doesn't want to work, you can't force her. If it is important to you that your gf works, you need to choose a different gf.\n\nSo I would say, treat her like the adult she is -- tell her that she needs to pony up the costs of her living because your pay isn't enough.
