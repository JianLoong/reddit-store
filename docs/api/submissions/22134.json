She can be somewhat impulsive and doesn't do a good job of weighing long-term consequences versus immediate gratification.  She and I (22M) butted heads a lot growing up and kind of have a love-hate relationship with each other.  Basically, we love each other but neither of us will shy away from making fun of the other when we mess up.  \n\nLast fall, my sister got engaged to her BF (25M) of 3 years.  To celebrate their engagement, they got matching tattoos of each other's names.  On their necks.  Like right in the middle of their necks below their chins.  Don't know how her BF made it through that with an Adam's apple, so kudos to him.  That alone got her some grief from both me and our parents.  But whatever you want to do, it's your body and your life.\n\nThis past weekend, my sister came to our parent's house and was visibly upset.  Apparently, she and her fiance had a big fight and he ended up breaking up with her.  She was asking my parents if she could move back in with them because her fiance kicked her out of his apartment.  They obviously agreed and we all gave her support and told her we would be there for her.  \n\nI currently live at home too as I'm home from college for the summer.  So, for the first time in a few years, both my sister and I are spending a lot of time at home together.  Which usually brings conflict between us.  She and I share a bathroom now and I had forgotten how much time she spends in there.  The only other bathroom is in my parent's master bedroom, but all of my stuff is in the bathroom we share.  \n\nThe other day, I was planning to get together with some friends and needed to get ready.  My sister was in the bathroom and would not come out.  I started by knocking politely and asking her when she would be done and she said a few minutes.  That dragged into a half hour and I asked again.  Same answer.  When it was nearly an hour, I pounded on the door and told her to GTFO so I could finish getting ready. \n\nWhen she opened the door, it was immediately apparent why she was taking so long.  She was trying to cover up her neck tattoo with makeup and failing miserably.  I immediately started laughing, I couldn't help it.  This of course made her mad, but I couldn't stop.  I cracked a few jokes about her needing to update her wardrobe to exclusively turtlenecks and scarfs, or to find another guy with the same name because unless she gets that thing lasered off, she's going to be looking at it in the mirror every day.  \n\nShe got pissed at me and called me an asshole, so I stopped.  She's still mad at me for \"kicking her while she's down\" and for not being more supportive.  But like, anyone could have seen this coming and I feel it's my job as the younger brother to rib her a little bit about it.  I know she feels heartbroken and sad already, but I'm just trying to bring a little normalcy and levity to the situation so that she can remember that life goes on.", "created_utc": 1689265816, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ypgis/aita_for_making_fun_of_my_sister_after_her_fiance/", "score": 3993, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your job is to grow up and actively try to develop some more mature and caring sensibilities.", "YTA. You couldn't help the laugh, but it's not actually your job to make your sister miserable. She already knows clearly what a bad decision the tattoo was.\n\nThe wound of the breakup is still fresh. You need to give it time to heal before you rib her about it. Note: that's more time than you'll expect. Take a cue from your parents, not your own inclinations.", "Everybody knows you only tattoo names of your kids and your mom never a spouse or GF as they come and go but your momma and your kids are forever. \n\nAnd right on her neck like how was she expecting to get jobs. She needs to get a loan and get laser removal. \n\nI hate ireuptable tattoo artists, the real deal ones would have refused this job for they know what is coming with these name tattoos of GFs and BFs", "YTA. It is not your job to be an asshole to her so that she can get on with life. That makes no sense.

You sound like someone who would \u2018rib\u2019 a family member over being overweight to \u2018bring levity\u2019 to a situation. Just like people are aware of their size your sister is aware of her mistake. Yes it was dumb but presumably she was in love and is still mourning this relationship. She doesn\u2019t need anyone making her feel worse to make themselves feel better. And that\u2019s all you were doing because she wasn\u2019t laughing only you.

You just have the guts to say what everyone else is thinking.", "This is possibly the most stupid thing I ever heard of. A tattoo of a partner alone is dumb, but on the neck? This is beyond stupid and one have to really question her ability to make decisions on her own. She is definitely not ready to take care of herself.\n\nNTA, it is time that she face consequences for her stupidity. The outside world will be a lot more TA to her than just a few jokes. This is very serious. \n\nNevertheless, instead of making fun of her, you should help her finding a solution asap. She needs to get that neck cleaned. This will cost a lot of money, but there is no alternative.", "YTA, I think it's too close to the break up for this, break ups are hella sensitive, the tattoo makes it worse, and yeah I agree that it's dumb, however, again it's too close to the break up to be joking like this.", "YTA  She's right - you are kicking her when she is already down. There is a time and place for gentle mockery but this isn't it. This isn't a minor thing she's going to get over quickly. Her relationship of three years has fallen apart and she is grieving a major loss. And she's got a permanent reminder - no one will be more aware of that than she is. \n\nIf you could really see her relationship ending after three years, then there was something wrong with it and she's coping with that too.

You spent the whole post talking shit, and then try to say \u201cI\u2019m trying to bring normalcy and levity to the situation.\u201d Nope, YTA and you know it.", "NTA. Certain things are so dumb that people just need to live with the consequences of their actions regardless of how it makes them feel. If you get a stupid tattoo on your throat then guess what? People are going to tell you you got a stupid tattoo. You joked about her needing turtle necks and that she has to find a s/o with the same name. That\u2019s extremely tame so I don\u2019t get why everyone\u2019s being so sensitive, especially when y\u2019all have that type of relationship. The jokes are applicable to anyone that has someone\u2019s name tattooed on them and also a bad tattoo on their neck. There are also literally stereotypes everyone knows about getting S/O name tattoos now a days and how neck tattoos will mess with your future so it\u2019s not like regardless of the situations outcome she made bad decisions.", "It's the truth though.  Why on earth would she get a tattoo there?  NTA.", "YTA this is something you could joke about later. But it\u2019s still fresh and painful. You\u2019re not wrong that getting matching names is a stupid idea, but this is basically kicking her when she\u2019s down. I don\u2019t think you had asshole intentions, but a long term breakup like that really hurts and she probably already feels really stupid for getting this tattoo.", "YTA, how callus you are, the emotional intelligence is in the single digits. I wonder if you are not experienced? Because it sounds like you have no experience having your heart broken. I have brothers and none of them found humor in my heart break. Yes the tattoos were in poor taste and foolish. But she didn\u2019t need you adding salt to it. Edit to add not all tattoos are in poor taste. But in this situation it seems to have backfired.", "YTA At 22 you should be able to see where this crossed the line. It is not your brotherly job to just rib her, sometimes it is your job to be compassionate and supportive.", "\"I'm an asshole to my sister but I don't understand why she doesn't like it.\" There, fixed it.", "Yes, she made an impulsive decision getting his name tattooed on her neck, but incessantly mocking her isn\u2019t helping her cope with the break up.

Your sister\u2019s an idiot", "YTA. \n\nOf course it was a bad choice, but you *were* kicking her when she was down. \n\nSide note: women have adam's apples too my dude. It's cartilage that every human has.", "Haha NTA. I feel like anytime someone gets their partners name tattooed on them it\u2019s the loud death knell that the end of the relationship is nigh.
