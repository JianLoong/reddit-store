You are in no way an AH for that. The opposite. \n\nBut cmon, don't play dumb here - your fiancee had no reasonable reason to just presume you were going to be the donor. That's a pretty huge thing that you'd expect your partner to tell you WAY upfront, like as soon as they're even thinking seriously about it, let alone have committed to do it. You spent ages in this relationship and intentionally omitted this *extremely important* information.\n\nIt will affect your health both short and long term. It will affect your lifestyle and finances. She may have to care for you or provide fir you in recovery. It may even affect your life expectancy. Your fiancee deserved to know before you got engaged and planned a whole life together while not telling her about this enormous, life-impacting decision.", "YTA\n\nNot for donating the kidney. It\u2019s admirable! YTA for starting to seriously date someone, move in together, get engaged AND never mentioning that you\u2019re about to go through a major surgery. You went through a significant physical transformation while achieving several relationship milestones. How was this never mentioned?!\n\nHer phrasing was unfortunate. You don\u2019t need her approval but she\u2019s damn right that she should have known. This may alter your lifestyle long term. There might be complications. She might become your caregiver. God forbid you develop the same autoimmune disease. \n\nYou expected her to just know you\u2019re the donor. Well, I think she expected clear communication as a minimum and now is wondering what else you expected her to know as well. Got a kid somewhere? Ex-con?", "Info: Have you been tested for the autoimmune disease your sister has? It's legit that your fianc\u00e9 is concerned with your decision to be a live donor if you could end up sick and they're now responsible for your care.", "But why is she upset? Just for not telling her or for doing it?That part is not clear to me. \n\nShe can still decide not to marry you if she doesn't want to deal with the health/financial consequences of your decision. That's her right. But it is also your right to do whatever you want with your body. I would never donate my organs to anyone nor would  I accept a donated organ, but it would never cross my mind to stop other people from doing it. \n\nNTA OP, but we need a little more info or update.", "What if she told you that before you got together that she\u2019d signed a contract to be a surrogate mother for someone? \n\nYour decision could affect your health adversely and therefore, your lives together.   \nim not saying your an asshole for donating your kidney but it certainly deserved a conversation that wasn\u2019t presented as a done deal.", "YTA for purposely hiding a huge medical issue for your fianc\u00e9. No she doesn\u2019t get a say in whether you donate but she certainly should have known about it well before you got to the point of proposing.

I would have thought it would come up much earlier in the relationship. Where's the communication? It sounds like you thought she somehow would have known.\n\nShe's not in the clear, either. Her reaction to you, bouncing and calling you an AH, and then thinking she has the rights to call the shots in something this life or death for your sister--not okay. If I found out that my husband was going to donate a kidney to his brother, I would support him, not treat him badly and try to take control of the situation. I have to wonder what her baggage is that she thinks she owns the rights to your body. AND that she thinks her opinion is more important than your sister's life. \n\nYou both need to have a serious talk.

Donating a kidney is a risky operation, you will require serious rehabilitation (and help during that time). It's potentially life limiting.\n\nYou partner deserved to know all that. *Talk about what's important in your life.*\n\nMany relationships fail due to lack of communication.

Are they on the same page for financial goals, are they aware of each other's medical family history.  If they actually had sat down to talk about all of this before deciding to get engaged, then the gf wouldn't have been so blindsided and determined if she wanted to take the risk of OP going through a rather risky surgery, deal with potential long-term health risks having only one kidney, and the possible risk of the financial risks involved if something happened.

I go to dialyses with her when no one else will sit there with her.\n\nShe gets an anonymous donor. Mind you, imagine watching a 22 year old sitting on dialyses whilst everyone has at least 20-40 years on you. She got an anonymous donor. I didn't even know if I should test or give mine because of JUDGING. Her brother matches. He wants to give. baby momma says no (LOL). She still got the anon donor.\n\nEnd of 2015..... she continues on life the way she knows. I'm trying still to convince her to live with me because I live closest to the hospital in our area that deals with kidney disease. nope nope nope. She finally comes to live with me, end of spring - early summer 2016. I'm working 6 days a week, driving her to dialyses, going back to work, driving to pick her up, so on so forth. We had nothing but each other.\n\nShe's slowly dying in front of me. Her kidney has rejected.. She refuses to tell anyone because she believes she has failed. Her nose is bleeding. She finally calls for help. They take her. I  cant go near the blood on the floor for weeks. I fly to see her in the hospital. You can tell everyone is sad because she is so young in the unit.\n\nShe comes back home in August. I dream of her dying.\n\nI watched her die, December 3rd. Right next to me. She dies as I drive her to see a man she really liked and I was gonna watch Golden Girls and wait for my friend's call.\n\nYour fiance can get fucked. I hope you follow your heart.\n\nYour sister is in my heart and mind. Sending all the love. You got this and already know what you have to do.", "YTA my dude you seriously should have told your fianc\u00e9e long before the surgery and such that you were donating!", "Yeah, health deficiencies/ decisions should be communicated.\nDo you have some sort of genetic disease that could be passed down to children? \nDo you plan to surgically alter your appearance?\n\nIt's really not about the decision, it's about to be informed and included into the life of your future spouse", "Think this is a control thing. Not a \"I care for your well being\" thing, from the sounds of it. And I'm pretty sure they do that while testing to see if they'reca match or not.", "totally agree with this.", "She doesn't HAVE TO get married, you know? She doesn't like what he's doing with his body? Then walk away.", "How does he \"purposely hide\" the procedure? How did he loose that much weight and gf didn't even ask about it? And also, I get informing your partner, but needing her approval? Hell no. This is not like a plastic surgery that will completely change his appearence", "I wouldn't say he needs approval per say but kidney donation comes with intense lifestyle changes and recovery. This isn't a quick day or two recovery this is \"I can't pee by myself you have to call off work\" bedrest and should one thing go wrong it could be extended by months.", "Because love is blind (and deaf) \ud83e\udd23 Just because you get along with and love someone doesn\u2019t mean you share values. You have to talk about the boring stuff when you\u2019re starting to consider marriage/long term, they\u2019re the things relationships end over. \n\nBut of course, talking about boring stuff like finances, medical history, religion, kids (and how all of those things relate to future kids and other life trajectories) is deeply unsexy. OP and fianc\u00e9e have only been together for about a year. Seems in this case, just a year isn\u2019t quite long enough for them to have had those boring practical conversations, which should really happen before engagement. \n\nMajor medical stuff should be discussed, even/especially something like an organ donation to a family member. Donating a kidney is a seriously big deal, it can lead to varying long term outcomes for the donor (actually it tends to be harder on the donor than the recipient) including at bare minimum, you won\u2019t have one to give to your hypothetical future child if they ever needed one or just that you\u2019d be inherently more medically fragile/unable to do certain things.\n\nAnd the recovery can mean months without being able to work, depending on what you do. A partner should be forewarned that you\u2019ll be needing care/likely unable to provide income, even if you weren\u2019t permanently altering your own medical status.\n\nI do think it\u2019s a YTA maybe slightly ESH situation, as OP should have made his plans known instead of just assuming she\u2019d pick up the hints/what everyone else already knew before they started dating, AND the fianc\u00e9e very much used the wrong words. She definitely can\u2019t stop him, and it\u2019s his ultimate decision, but she does have the right to be able to make an informed decision on whether she wants to commit to marriage including his planning to undergo a procedure that will limit him physically for life. Maybe she wanted to go skydiving for her 50th - and wants a husband who will be medically allowed to jump with her?", "Voluntarily donating an organ isn't something you'd ask or expect from most people.\n\nHe should have told her beforehand. Health deficiencies / decisions should be explained to someone you want to spend your life with", "I am curious about what's going on, though, as he said \"his sister loved the things that ruined her kidney.\" On one hand, he says its an autoimmune issue, but on the other hand....that. \n\nShe's still wrong to say he needs permission, but yeah, if something weird was going on with the sister I can see why she'd be upset for him not telling her and for not telling her earlier.", "Women, by and large, usually outlive their partners anyways. Op is male and new fianc\u00e9 is female btw.\n\nI do think he should have mentioned it, I do NOT think she has any say in it though. Her attitude is worrisome to me, it\u2019s not because he didn\u2019t tell her, she is mad that she doesn\u2019t have a say in it. Which I truly do not understand.", "That's the real difference. Your partner would have told you.\n\nWhat if you partner agreed to do then went out and lost 50 pounds of weight and changed his diet and drinking habits to improve health. Then a year after agreeing to donate his kidney told you he was doing it.\n\nThat would be a massive problem to me due to communication failure.", "THIS!", "Just a hunch, but maybe that he just didn't mention - for their entire relationship - that he was planning to undergo a potentially life-limiting procedure which might also entail months off work to recover (if things go well) during which he would require care and support, and that this will potentially affect his future health, lifestyle and lifespan?\n\nJust... you know... maybe worth mentioning to someone before you ask them to spend the rest of your lives together?\n\nTo be clear, if it was a deal breaker upfront, he would probably have dodged a bullet. But that doesn't excuse his just not telling her.", "> I don\u2019t understand why she cares so much\n\nBecause she\u2019s his fianc\u00e9e and donating a kidney is a big deal? It\u2019s not like donating blood. I totally agree that OP is in the right for wanting to donate his kidney to the sister, but being engaged to someone entitles them to knowledge about decisions regarding your health. (Please note that I\u2019m not talking about things like weight loss here, just major surgeries) OP is N T A for donating his kidney but an AH for not telling her when they got ENGAGED and playing dumb when she came to know.", "As someone whose father and aunty have had transplants (both had kidneys donated to by their sisters) this is a big decision and your family/partner needs to know (If not agree ) if you start your relationship off on this foundation it's hard yo trust someone. however I'm surposed that OPs sister never mentioned it to the fiance ?", "On one hand, he says it is an autoimmune issue. On the other hand, he says his sister \"love the things that ruined her kidney.\" If she was drinking heavily or doing drugs or even eating foods she isn't supposed to.... despite having Lupus, I can see why the fiancee might be pissed...especially as he kept it a secret. \n\nShe's still wrong to say he needs permission, though.", "But that\u2019s the entire point. He didn\u2019t give her that information.", "I get that, I really do, but he doesn't say anything about expecting her to care for him post-op. In fact I presume if he decided to go through with it prior to their relationship he was considering alternative care like family.", "That is insane. Organ donation is not the fianc\u00e9e\u2019s right of refusal and it\u2019s for his sister. It\u2019s not some random stranger. When asked he explained. This want some nefarious master plan. This was decided before the relationship. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s getting a vasectomy.", "He said it's an autoimmune issue, but also said \"his sister loved the things that damaged her kidney.\" If she has lupus (which is most likely) but was living a destructive lifestyle before preparing for the transplant, I can see why that might anger the fiancee. \n\nShe still is wrong for saying he needed permission.", "It still wouldn\u2019t bother me in the slightest. It\u2019s his body, not mine. He could come into our bedroom right now & tell me he promised one of his organs to his sister years ago. I would support him in this. Again, it\u2019s his body. I don\u2019t own him. He is his own person & capable of making decisions for himself. \n\nAlso I absolutely support him in healthy life choices. My partner discovered he has lactose & gluten intolerance. I joined him in going gluten-free & lactose-free of my own volition to help support him & so he doesn\u2019t have to worry about getting accidentally sick. I truly don\u2019t understand why a partner wouldn\u2019t support healthy lifestyle changes.", "He might have not told her in clear terms, but it looks like they did discuss the fact that the sister needs a transplant and (presumably, but I might be wrong) that he's the only one compatible. \n\nIf so, well it's 2+2 tbh. \n\nOr did she expect him to throw his own flesh and blood under the bus? As you said, deal-breaker.", "But we still don't know why she's mad. The not telling or the donation itself? If she doesn't like not been told, or that OP is hiding other stuff, or that's the way he behaves, then she should totally walk away. It's a red flag. Donating doesn't make him an AH, not telling the Fiance does. So it should be up to her whether she stays with a person that doesn't share this kind of information or not.", "It's not about his decision to donate a kidney. \nIt's about withholding information. What else does he not tell her? Genetic decencies that could be passed down to children? Out of wed lol children? Maybe he already has a vasectomy?\n\nDonating a kidney is a severe medical procedure and on par with a vasectomy. A vasectomy is actually a far less invasive procedure than a kidney donation", "It appears that she expected to be told about the decision. Not unfair.\n\nAnd no, \"she needs a transplant\" in NO way implies he would be the donor. Siblings and close relatives are not necessarily matches for donation by the way, there's a testing process and then further assessment to determine that person who is agenetic match is a suitable/safe donor. \n\nDonating an organ isn't like pulling a tooth or getting your appendix out. You can't just spring it on your life partner and say you've known for years and just kinda assumed they did.", "> well it\u2019s 2+2 tbh\n\nIt isn\u2019t. Fianc\u00e9e had no reason to assume that OP would be donating his kidney without ever talking about it. You can\u2019t just donate your kidney to someone without knowing if you\u2019re a match. OP hasn\u2019t said whether he mentioned being compatible, so it\u2019s safe to say he didn\u2019t.\n\n> not something I should\u2019ve disclosed to my partner\n\nOP clearly stated in the post that he didn\u2019t think it was necessary to mention it to his fianc\u00e9e because he made the decision before he started dating her. What was his plan? Not telling her till the day of the surgery?", "You\u2019re running away with suppositions and wild meanderings. I will not be taking this journey with you. Bon voyage.", "Read again. He said he's the only match. This was most likely common knowledge to the whole family.", "I do think she knew he was the only match tho. The whole family got tested and he was the only suitable one. How could she not notice? Unless they never talked about this with the whole family/ she never talks with his family, that is.", "Then why didn\u2019t anyone bother to tell her. They discussed his sisters condition and he left out that he was donating? Asshole move.", "You're an asshole but only to yourself dude.

But here's the problem no commentor is getting. How the hell could you have told her? You've only been dating for about a year, maybe less? I would've waited to tell her until about the six month mark of you dating. Yes you should've disclosed it to her as she does have the right to know about anything you may be passing on to her children medically and genetically.

Sweetheart, I know you're mad I didn't tell you, but you have no right to approve of something I'm doing for my sister when you weren't around when I made the decision. So yes, a dumb thing was that you didn't tell her. But needing her approval for a decision that's already been made? Fuck, no. Third, why the fuck are you getting married so soon? You don't know her well, you don't even know what her behaviors are like, and you're just starting to learn about them now. She doesn't know you all that well, she barely even had time to fucking heal from a divorce. Wow dude, next partner, wait five years or more at least. Oh and, don't forget to mention this procedure to your next partner, that's an asshole thing to not do it.", "ESH \n\nYou should have told her. You should have told her from the off.

You should have told her. But it's your kidney, it's your sister, it's your choice. You don't need to get approval to do it.

You are a potential donor & have pledged away an irreplaceable key to saving their life if that happened. \n\nYou may feel a certain way about your sister and that\u2019s okay. But I know how I would feel about my partner pledging part of their body away without telling me \u2026 esp if it is a hereditary condition. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, my partner is type 1 diabetic. There are already risks that come with having certain conditions in families. He is an unlikely donor if anything were to happen to our children, and that\u2019s just an unfortunate hand to be dealt - but I knew that & accepted that going into it. However, I would be absolutely devastated and feel completely blindsided if I was in your fianc\u00e9\u2019s position. \n\nIf there is risk to future children, and the only thing to save your sister is a kidney, well - you just won\u2019t have an extra if your kid needs it. \n\nYou say she \u201cloved the things that ruined her kidney\u201d If it\u2019s inflicted by lifestyle choices, like drugs, alcohol or communicable disease I think you have a lot better footing, but there is argument for those types of things running in families as well.

I wanna say that up front. You\u2019re DEFINITELY not the AH for that. \n\nBut she needed to be told, my dude. You\u2019re gonna be in recovery after surgery, and there may be lifelong health snarls because you\u2019re living with a single kidney.

This is a HUGE piece of information you withheld from her, and for some reason you think that was not a big deal?\n\nBesides, a donor in the patient\u2019s immediate family is just one option, not the default.

I do think her reaction is the worse one here, but neither of you are blameless.\n\nTo be clear, you're not an AH for deciding to donate, nor for not getting her advice on it.

Does she think you shouldn't donate your kidney? Would she rather have a one-kidney husband or a grieving husband with a dead sister? Both are life-changing! (I've lost my sister a few years ago, and if donating a kidney could have saved her, I would have donated mine)", "NTA but it would have been better to tell her. You don't need her approval either way. Sounds like you may have inadvertently dodged a bullet though. She's already divorced at least once and her 1st reaction was to run away after telling you that you should have gotten her permission. GET OUT NOW.", "YTA for not telling her, but you're a great guy for helping your sister.", "YTA. \n\nNo you don't need her permission or approval, but you sure as hell need to tell her.

How are you guys getting married and you don't seem to know these kinds of things about each other? Like, she decided to ask you why you'd lost a significant amount of weight after you got engaged?? And somehow you didn't bother to ever tell her you were donating a kidney?? \n\nYTA I suppose, because you either deliberately kept something really significant from your fiance, or you've just proposed to someone who you don't seem ready to integrate into your life.", "NTA because the decision was made before you were dating and engaged. What is she gonna do tell your sister (Soon to be her sister) no because she wasn't consulted back when she wasn't even involved? Get real. At best she can be upset that she wasn't **told** sooner, but she had no say in the matter at the time and it's a set decision.", "NTA.

That\u2019s the whole point", "I'm taking her insistence on approval with a big pinch of salt, given OPS demonstrated failure to communicate well with his Fianc\u00e9", "I guess for me its a scale of assholes, and OP feels like more of an Asshole here for his longterm deception in comparison to fianc\u00e9 not great outburst.\n\n  \nThat coupled with the disingenuous phrasing of OPS question, like no one, im sure not even the fiance would take issue with him donating a kidney, he should be phrasing it as  \nIATA for hiding critical medical information from my fianc\u00e9 or words to that effect", "Please, please do some actual research on this. Yes, humans don\u2019t need two kidneys, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the loss of a kidney doesn\u2019t have/can have a serious impact on our health and life long consequences. And it has life long impacts because you\u2019re required to adjust your diet permanently. Drinking normal amounts of alcohol as an example is something that may cause life threatening issues\n\nThe possible consequences and health related issues make the donation that much more admirable. But they\u2019re also the reason why you have to sit down your partner and explain it to them instead of keeping it a secret. They can\u2019t forbid you from doing so, but they\u2019re well within their right to draw boundaries, disagree with it and even end the relationship.", "Thing is he does\u2026 even in uk they won\u2019t give hysterectomy to woman without serious medical need (I know because I asked for one after my daughter was born and was told what if my husband wants another child\u2026.)", "> we started dating after I volunteered to donate my kidney to my sister\n\n> Through some stupidity on my part, since in my mind it was something that I've decided before we started dating, therefore not something that I should disclosed to my partner, and especially because for me it was given that I would be the donor.\n\nMakes it crystal clear that testing was done BEFORE he started dating her. He had already decided to donate when he started dating her.", "They probably told her/she found out. But apparently she expected him not to donate despite being the only one who's able to do so.\n\nTHAT'S the real asshole move.", "True. But it doesn't mean that they never discussed it afterwards among the family. \n\nBut maybe they are a super weird family that never discusses life changing surgeries for some reason, dunno.", "If the fianc\u00e9e was shocked to hear about it and was mad at him for not telling her, it leaves no doubt in my mind that there was no conversation about this around her.\n\n> they are a super weird family that never discusses life changing surgeries\n\nCould be that, or could be that OP did discuss it with his family/sister but never included fianc\u00e9e in the conversation. I\u2019m betting on the latter."]}
