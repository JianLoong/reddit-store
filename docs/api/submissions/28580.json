The more you insist she wears something else, the more friction you're going to cause in your relationship with her. Keep insisting only if that's worth it to you. There will be other hills to die on.\n\nAlso, nobody has any obligations to contribute financially to your wedding or any events leading up to it. You and your fianc\u00e9 are adults and should be having the wedding you can afford. If your families want to/are able to contribute, fine, but they don't have to.", "NTA - however, she is never going to change the dress.  This is her trying to muck up your wedding.

Edit to add, when someone requests you stay on theme, you stay on theme period. More and more people are requesting Adult Only weddings, especially when it's more last minute. This isn't her wedding, and she needs to deal or not come. It's an INVITATION. And they can be revoked as easily as they were sent out. Your partner also offered to pay for the dress and the one she already bought. This is about control. You're NTA, but also be ready for this to be the family you marry into. :( Hopefully you and your fiance can cut ties or figure out how to not let that kind of toxicity continue after the wedding.", "NTA for expecting guests to know what \"black tie formal\" means and then choose an outfit in line with that. I do think it's odd in general to ask guests to show in advance what they plan to wear. If your concern is the wedding photos then I can see that.\n\nPeople who show up dressed inappropriately might be rude or clueless (and thus just embarrass themselves),  surely you would still let them attend, or...?", "NTA, but I think you are putting too much energy in to this woman. \n\nFirst I saw the link you sent of her dress, and it isn't terrible. It could be dressed up for an evening event, and I don't know what age has to do with a dress being appropriate or not. \n\nBut regardless, save your money and let her wear the dress. If she is dressed inappropriately, it only looks bad on her, not you. Make sure you take lots of pictures that don't include her (along with some that do) so that you can have the memories you want. \n\nThe reality is no one is going to notice what she is wearing (since I have seen the link, if it was like a hot pink club dress, this may not apply of course), but they will hear about everyone fighting. She is going to fade in to the background of your wedding, so pick your battles. I say this only because if they have all been awful this whole time, don't give them one more thing. Spend your time planning with friends and family you do like, take some time to ensure she is seated from away from you and has a limited role and limited input, refuse to engage in any petty drama, and get ready for your wedding without drama. \n\nLet me say again- no one will care what she is wearing. You can let her and her drama fill up all your time between now and the wedding, or you can say \"nice dress, see you at the wedding\" and spend your time having fun. On your wedding day, you can spend your time being upset and staring at her and her dress, or you can look around and see the love filling the room and what is really important. \n\nThe best revenge for people who want attention is to deprive them of that attention. To be happy on your day, to walk away from any drama, and to be unbothered by MIL is the best way to cut her down to size.", "Stop worrying about what other people are wearing.  This isn't a theatrical production.  No one will blame you for what someone else is wearing.  If it is inappropriate, she will make a fool of herself and it is no reflection on you.  She knows you don't like it, the more attention you give her, the worse she will make YOU feel. So, ignore her, stop feeding the troll and get on with your marriage.", "INFO: I simply MUST see what this dress looks like that you're claiming isn't \"age appropriate\"", "NTA\n\nthe easy answer is to uninvite her. She will make the day all about her and complain constantly.\n\nMake it clear that she either comes and adheres to your dress code or not to bother coming.", "NTA - She was hiding her dress from you until the point (in her mind) of no return.  You wisely called her on it and stuck to your dress code.  As far as everyone else saying they all love her dress is a distraction to try to force you to accept her dress.  Have none of it.  You have clearly and with due amount of time stated the dress code for your wedding and that's it.  MIL can either suck it up and abide by your rules or not go, her choice.  You're done.", "Let her wear it & embarrass herself.", "elope", "You can either let this eat at you or you can take the high road and accept that your in-laws are going to be a PITA no matter what.\n\nThat out of the way, you never said your ages so I'll clue you in on some truths about weddings...\n\n1.  As a couple, you only get to dictate what your wedding party will wear.  If MIL isn't a part of the wedding party, then let it go.\n\n2.  The family never needs to pay a cent for anything in your wedding.  You and your husband are getting married so the two of you should never expect financial help... accept it graciously if it's given... but never expect it.\n\n3.  Concentrate on what is going right instead of what's going wrong.  You are getting married to your love... keep that as your focus.\n\n4.  After the wedding, block his side of the family from your social media.  Don't turn their drama into your drama.  Believe me, low contact is sane contact.  But also, don't begrudge your husband about seeing them when he wants.  For all their faults, they brought him into the world.\n\nBlessings and peace going out to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
