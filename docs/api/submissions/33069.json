He's just not that into you - fair grounds for divorce\n\n2. He thinks he's making you uncomfortable or something and therefore turning you down - communication should be the first step.\n\nYou need to have an open, honest, frank, conversation with him about his expectations of being married, vs your own. \n\nIf they don't align here then you're sexually incompatible and thats ok to get a divorce about.", "Nta, obviously. It\u2019s an arranged marriage, these aren\u2019t exactly known for their happiness factor, and they certainly don\u2019t happen because two people were so in love when they got married.  If you weren\u2019t already in love when you got married I\u2019m not surprised you\u2019re still not that into each other.  \n\nI guess just bring it up politely with him and know your rights.  I don\u2019t know what country you\u2019re in, but if divorce is viable or marriage counseling it\u2019d be worth looking into.  I can\u2019t really imagine counseling would help given that you can\u2019t go back to \u2018good times\u2019 that basically never existed, but idk.  Worth a shot, and when it fails, maybe you\u2019re husband will also agree that the marriage isn\u2019t working and therapy might help him see what you see.  \n\nGood luck op, but make sure you have an escape plan if things go south.", "Physical intimacy is an important factor in a happy marriage. I come from a background where arranged marriages work and can be successful, but if after 5 years of living together you have not fallen in love with each other and have not been able to achieve physical intimacy, then that is fair grounds for a divorce. However, if you feel attracted to him and want to save the marriage, I suggest talking to him first and figuring out what the root cause is for his lack of interest. It could be so many things and you won't know unless you try and find out. And see how you want to proceed after that.", "NTA. Intimacy is an important part of a relationship.

What did you ask and what did he say?", "It's arranged. So he could be asexual, he could be gay, he could even just not find you sexually attractive.

This is normal where you live? Just to get perspective.\n\nIt sounds to me you did many things already, including having an open conversation about it and telling him it will lead to divorce if things go on (right?)?\n\nThere is another option besides you two not clicking, him being asexual or whatever: is it medical? Has he seen a doctor? Or does he take medications (like antidepressants)? Habe you seen to that?\n\nEdit: if there is no solution anywhere in sight after the last few tries to change something, I guess you need either an open marriage (which needs consent from bith of you and clear rules) or a divorce.", "Don't sacrifice your happiness to avoid disappointing your family.

I definitely know people who are happy in their arranged marriages but they are not statistically as likely to be as happy. If your comment is based solely on divorce rates in arranged marriages vs love marriages then that doesn\u2019t correlate to happiness. People in arranged marriages tend to come from more conservative families than love marriages and are therefore more likely to stay in abusive or unhappy marriages due to the stigma of divorce.", "Did you tell him you will divorce him if he does not cooperate? \n\nWhy does he miss the appointments? Is he ashamed? Do you know? I mean having troubles in bed is a huge deal associated with a lot of shame for most men. \nThe alternative might be (emphasize on might, since this is just speculation) that he is unhappy in the arranged marriage and wants an actual divirce. But he does not want to initiate it himself because of the stigma?", "Yes. Very true. In which case, he may benefit from counselling and her support. But he needs to communicate with her regardless of what the issue is."]}
