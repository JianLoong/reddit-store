I'm going to be completely transparent to paint the best picture. I'm 29(f) and I am a recovering alcoholic. I have been sober for 5 months now (I believe, days are running together and I never wrote down the actual date). After I stopped drinking, my BC failed (doctors state it's due to my body being so used to alcohol that the chemicals in the BC no longer worked for my system). I'm currently 8 weeks pregnant. Obviously it wasn't planned but I do see this as a god send. I fully believe that this has changed my life for the better and even that this baby, my baby, has saved me. My husband and I are very excited. Scared shitless but excited. \n\nAll of my in laws know about my recovery. I've been with my husband for years and I couldn't even go to a family function without bringing booze. I had big issues. So they are all fully aware. They NEVER held it against me and have all been supportive but little comments have been thrown out there since finding out my pregnancy status and it's really like.. bothering me, I guess. Or not even bothering me but I just don't have the patience or tolerance for it. Like whenever I become irritated seemingly out of the blue (which I'm assuming is from my new found hormonal shift), the comments of \"oh it's because you're a dry drunk\" start in (for those wondering: dry drunk is a term they use when someone in recovery still gets the angry feelings they did from the alcohol, despite being sober- essentially). I've asked them to stop talking about it and making comments and usually they do. \n\nBut I had my MIL, both SILs and my own sister over yesterday for a little brunch/girl's day. I'm fatigued from hell and my morning sickness, while not severe, is picking up. The only thing I've been able to keep down is coffee and tuna fish, which I'm not supposed to eat a lot of, and cheese. It's been rough. Well, I make myself a coffee because for whatever reason it eases my stomach and my SIL immediately is at me. Starts saying \"You're not supposed to drink that!\" And \"You're just trading out one addiction for another\"- after she saw me grab a second cup of coffee. I just kind of rolled my eyes and told her to get out. I was calm. I was just over it. She looked confused and started nervous laughing so I said \"No, I'm serious. Get out.\" She did leave and it was pretty awkward after that. I'm just tired of her comments because it's usually her making them. Regardless, I've heard through the grapevine as of this morning that my MIL is telling everyone I was being \"petty as hell\" and that my SIL was just looking out for the baby. AITA?\n\nETA: just want to clarify that yes, I do have outside support. I still go to AA meetings despite not having any cravings for it anymore and I also see a recovery specialist through the hospital.

The fact that your are a recovering addict doesn't give her the right to police whatever you do with your body.\n\nIt's even more frustrating when it's an incorrect advice. You can drink coffee while pregnant without issue. Most doctors will start worrying if you take more than 4 cups per day", "Completely NTA.

Congratulations on the sobriety and the pregnancy. Addiction is extremely difficult and you should be very proud of yourself.

This is why a lot of times addicts relapse.", "NTA - they\u2019ve continuously been disrespectful to you even in your own home.

You said that you asked the family to stop making comments about your pregnancy, yet your SIL ignored this request and gave you unsolicited advice and made a rude assumption in *your home*. We all hear about what pregnant women should and shouldn't consume, but at the end of the day, it's a private matter between the pregnant person and their doctor. If someone does feel the need to say something out of concern for a baby, there's ways to politely offer advice without being rude and presumptuous. (Edit to add: you can drink coffee - just not too much. SIL is wrong).\n\nI get that feeling when you're pushed too far. You didn't insult your SIL; you just asked her to leave. It's your home, so it's your rules. SIL crossed a boundary, and there was a consequence for it.", "NTA.\n\nThe moment you become pregnant people stop seeing you as a human being. You become the candy wrapper, only fit for conveying forth the delight within. After birth, you and your needs will cease to exist unless you assert yourself. It's dehumanizing and exhausting.

Is that true? Did your doctor say you could have that?\u201d Which is far less offensive and it\u2019s approached as questions rather than accusations. \n\nBut aside from that, the big picture here is that your in-laws suck. They\u2019re essentially acting like they\u2019re trying to punish you for getting sober and not letting you forget you were an alcoholic. Like you\u2019re going to be serving a life sentence they\u2019re not going to let you put behind you or forget.  \n\nAnd also, they\u2019re wrong again. You\u2019re not exhibiting \u201cdry drunk\u201d symptoms. You\u2019re exhibiting pregnancy symptoms. You\u2019re suffering from mood imbalances from hormone fluctuations. Your MIL should understand that very well. And anyone who knows anything about pregnancy hormones should understand irritability Is a given. \n\nYou need to set boundaries and tell them that you\u2019re not going to tolerate them constantly blaming everything you do on your former drinking and recovery.

I held my job down, never missed work and all my bills were paid on time and usually in advance. I generally drank 12-18 beers every other day, depending on whether or not my husband drank with me (he's not a big drinker but when he would drink with me I ended up drinking more than normal). It was bad enough that I never experienced hangovers. Not since I was a teen, when I started drinking really heavy. I watched my sister die when I was 13 and I had been drinking ever since.

I felt the need to drink one night but my body was fully telling me that I did NOT want it. I did a lot of soul searching that night. I didn't go and get alcohol like I wanted and I was pissed about it. Got migraines. And I guess at that point I just realized it wasn't even fun anymore. I didn't enjoy drinking.

You\u2019re only 5 months sober AND going through the hormonal changes of pregnancy so give yourself a break. You\u2019re doing fine. I went through the in-laws from hell during my sobriety infancy as well. The key is to set and maintain strong boundaries with them. Mine were excessively cruel because they were deflecting to take focus off a Golden Child son who was addicted to heroin, gambling and sex. They consciously or unconsciously ( I don\u2019t care which ) were trying to make a big deal out of my addiction to keep him off the other family members radar. Make sure you get and keep a good sponsor. You\u2019re only 5 months in. Anyone with any knowledge about recovery knows that you\u2019re on the right track but need to focus on positive people. Keep the naysayers at a distance until you\u2019re more prepared to deal with them. In time you will be. A couple of key phrases besides \u201cOne day at a time \u201c are \u201c Take life on life\u2019s terms \u201c and \u201c Easy does it\u201d . God Bless you and your child and I\u2019m sending healing karma and positive thoughts from Upstate New York.", "Since you\u2019re in AA if she wanted to help you she could attend an ALANON meeting to learn that her comments are completely out of line and could even be counterproductive to you sobriety. Policing your pregnancy make her doubly the AH. Congratulations on how well you have been doing OP. So proud of you!", "NTA congratulations on your sobriety and pregnancy! SIL can take a hike right to some manners classes. You\u2019ve expressed repeatedly that you\u2019re uncomfortable and they won\u2019t stop. Maybe this way they\u2019ll learn when you put your foot down.", "NTA as someone who struggles with addiction I can not think of anything more infuriating than being called a \u201cdry drunk\u201d when you\u2019re fucking sober. Congrats on the recovery! You\u2019re going to be an awesome mum!", "First of all: congrats on your sobriety. \nAlso congrats on being pregnant. \n\nI think those of your family making those remarks are the real assholes. \nWhy do they have to poke at the same issue over and over. I'm not surprised you've had it with this shit.\n\nI'd write a letter explaining that although you're capable of making fun of yourself you're more than tired of backhanded \"jokes\" about your issue. \nAnd that everyone butting in with unwanted and unneeded \"help\" is not welcome in your house as at least in your own home you want to be yourself free from being judged by others. \n\nI don't even think it was petty. You were looking out for yourself. And honestly they had it coming. \nPetty would have been showing them what it feels like when someone brings up old mistakes ALL THE DAMN TIME. \n\nNTA", "Nta", "NTA, and I would consider not entertaining when you have morning sickness. It\u2019s just added stress.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu need support, not some AH SIL harasing you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCoffee is MUCH better than alcohol, and a small price for your sucessful recovery.", "NTA but it doesn't sound like you have a sponsor. I'd suggest getting one, because they can help you pregame this kind of thing. (53F with 26 years sober here.) With less than a year sober I would suggest avoiding events where you can't leave on your own whenever you need to, which would mean not hosting anything (since as you've seen, you can't remove yourself from the situation, you have to tell them to go.) Good luck and congrats on the baby!", "NTA. She was not only shaming your addiction she was also policing your body and pregnancy. Two cups of coffee is generally considered to be fine in pregnancy and there\u2019s debate about even needing to limit it that much. Good on you for standing up for yourself. She is not a doctor or your mental health professional and she does not get an opinion.", "NTA, probably doesnt realize that you are pregnant and morning sickness and foods you can take differ from each person srry but I think that you husbands side of the family is bonkers\n\nbut just to establish peace for now find a way to get the msg across that ur going through a hard time mentally and you dont need nasty comments thrown at you she seems pretty dense so goodluck", "My tummy did an involuntary squeeze when I read \"Coffee and Tuna\" the first two things I had to ban from the house when I was pregnant.

Make sure they understand rude useless comments will not be tolerated.  If they cant really support you then they can help you by keeping their mouths shut and never around you. (politest way I can word it, or you can just tell them shut up or f off)", "NTA", "YTA. You're NOT supposed to be drinking more than one cup of coffee when you're pregnant, so your SIL was not out of line telling you so. I'm sure it's the hormones making you irritable, but you should apologize. That said, your family and friends should stop making the type of comments that put you back in the \"addict\" position.", "ESH. You\u2019re irritated and hormonal . And your SIL isn\u2019t your doctor so tell her to keep her opinions to herself", "NTA! Recovering alcoholics and addicts can be annoyed by the rude behavior of others just like anyone else can. Your child will need you to be assertive and to set that example for him/her! You\u2019re just getting a jumpstart on being a great mom! Way to go!", "NTA! Congrats on the sobriety and baby!

Is that true? Did your doctor say you could have that?\u201d Which is far less offensive and it\u2019s approached as questions rather than accusations.\n\nThat shit is still very offensive, maybe even worse because it's condescending as hell.  \"Did you doctor say you can have that?\"  Seriously you would ask someone that?  She was drinking coffee FFS, not shooting heroin.  It's way out of line to grill anyone about their *private* medical situation and their doctor's advice.", "Then they should just be grateful that she isn't drinking anymore, rather than looking for nits to pick.", "SIL should keep her concerns about OP *drinking coffee* to her damn self.", "they're not looking out for her though, they're deliberately looking for ways to put her down", "How is SIL an expert on whether OP should or should not drink coffee or that she is trading one addiction for another?

She is capable of seeking medical advice, she doesn\u2019t have to share that medical advice, and then making her own decisions about that advice. \nPregnant people do not all of a sudden become incompetent people who should be questioned about whether or not a doctor has already signed off on all their decisions.", "Be careful. 5 months is too soon to declare victory and after baby is born alcohol is still there in the world.

I also just hit five months sober. Good job! I'm sorry that your in-laws aren't being supportive.", "My friend could only eat coke floats. She ate/drank a ton of caffeine.
