I'm going to be completely transparent to paint the best picture. I'm 29(f) and I am a recovering alcoholic. I have been sober for 5 months now (I believe, days are running together and I never wrote down the actual date). After I stopped drinking, my BC failed (doctors state it's due to my body being so used to alcohol that the chemicals in the BC no longer worked for my system). I'm currently 8 weeks pregnant. Obviously it wasn't planned but I do see this as a god send. I fully believe that this has changed my life for the better and even that this baby, my baby, has saved me. My husband and I are very excited. Scared shitless but excited. \n\nAll of my in laws know about my recovery. I've been with my husband for years and I couldn't even go to a family function without bringing booze. I had big issues. So they are all fully aware. They NEVER held it against me and have all been supportive but little comments have been thrown out there since finding out my pregnancy status and it's really like.. bothering me, I guess. Or not even bothering me but I just don't have the patience or tolerance for it. Like whenever I become irritated seemingly out of the blue (which I'm assuming is from my new found hormonal shift), the comments of \"oh it's because you're a dry drunk\" start in (for those wondering: dry drunk is a term they use when someone in recovery still gets the angry feelings they did from the alcohol, despite being sober- essentially). I've asked them to stop talking about it and making comments and usually they do. \n\nBut I had my MIL, both SILs and my own sister over yesterday for a little brunch/girl's day. I'm fatigued from hell and my morning sickness, while not severe, is picking up. The only thing I've been able to keep down is coffee and tuna fish, which I'm not supposed to eat a lot of, and cheese. It's been rough. Well, I make myself a coffee because for whatever reason it eases my stomach and my SIL immediately is at me. Starts saying \"You're not supposed to drink that!\" And \"You're just trading out one addiction for another\"- after she saw me grab a second cup of coffee. I just kind of rolled my eyes and told her to get out. I was calm. I was just over it. She looked confused and started nervous laughing so I said \"No, I'm serious. Get out.\" She did leave and it was pretty awkward after that. I'm just tired of her comments because it's usually her making them. Regardless, I've heard through the grapevine as of this morning that my MIL is telling everyone I was being \"petty as hell\" and that my SIL was just looking out for the baby. AITA?\n\nETA: just want to clarify that yes, I do have outside support. I still go to AA meetings despite not having any cravings for it anymore and I also see a recovery specialist through the hospital. I started seeing her before I even found out I was pregnant.", "created_utc": 1674831735, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10mmxz5/aita_for_kicking_my_sil_out_of_my_house_when_we/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A doctor would probably be happy you did what you could to keep something down. \n\nAdditionally, it sounds like shaming is something common with the in-laws. Rather than being supportive of your decision not to drink, they choose to make comments that are counterproductive to your sobriety.", "NTA. The fact that your are a recovering addict doesn't give her the right to police whatever you do with your body.\n\nIt's even more frustrating when it's an incorrect advice. You can drink coffee while pregnant without issue. Most doctors will start worrying if you take more than 4 cups per day", "Completely NTA. Constantly throwing your ongoing recovery in your face is just downright disrespectful. You don't have to take that kind of negativity from them. If anything, they should be SUPPORTING you through your pregnancy knowing your history and your struggles. Why even be like that? Ugh, horrible people.", "NTA. Congratulations on the sobriety and the pregnancy. Addiction is extremely difficult and you should be very proud of yourself. The difficult thing with being an addict is that it takes people time to adjust. I don't know how you were before becoming sober. Regardless, they have to start treating you like a sober person. This is why a lot of times addicts relapse.", "NTA - they\u2019ve continuously been disrespectful to you even in your own home. Your baby barely has a heartbeat and they\u2019re already questioning your ability to be a parent openly. And they are not that supportive if they\u2019re making these type of negative derogatory comments towards your path in sobriety. See these people way less and I hope your recovery goes well! I\u2019d suggest finding a therapist whose well versed in addiction and recovery as well as unsupportive family.

To me it sounds they are just trying to sabotage your recovery and they don\u2019t respect you enough not to say those things to you. I think you should have a clear conversation with all three of them and tell that your recovery is not a joke and please respect that. Be firm. Also tell them that if they cannot do that then you see no point in talking to them or having anything to with them.", "NTA. You said that you asked the family to stop making comments about your pregnancy, yet your SIL ignored this request and gave you unsolicited advice and made a rude assumption in *your home*. We all hear about what pregnant women should and shouldn't consume, but at the end of the day, it's a private matter between the pregnant person and their doctor. If someone does feel the need to say something out of concern for a baby, there's ways to politely offer advice without being rude and presumptuous. (Edit to add: you can drink coffee - just not too much. SIL is wrong).\n\nI get that feeling when you're pushed too far. You didn't insult your SIL; you just asked her to leave. It's your home, so it's your rules. SIL crossed a boundary, and there was a consequence for it.", "NTA.\n\nThe moment you become pregnant people stop seeing you as a human being. You become the candy wrapper, only fit for conveying forth the delight within. After birth, you and your needs will cease to exist unless you assert yourself. It's dehumanizing and exhausting. Establish boundaries early, and enforce them often. If people are upset because they can't dictate your behavior, the can leave.\n\nConsider joining the Reddit baby-bumps group for your due date. In addition to r/babybumps there are break out groups on a monthly basis. They can be very helpful.", "NTA, your in laws can fuck right off.", "INFO Do you have outside support? I am asking this because maybe you need to talk to other people who can fully help your situation? I am NOT saying any ONE method of sobriety is better than the next, but have you talked to your OB/GYN about issues? It can take 2 years for our bodies to get to where they should be after the drug is put down. Sometimes longer. Congratulations for your sobriety. Edit. While I sure think of you as NTA, I would talk to your doctor about this.", "NTA. As my father, a psychologist, always says, \u201cthere\u2019s always a way to say something with finesse\u201d. \n\nIn other words, your SIL could have addressed her concerns about your coffee and pregnancy without being rude or insensitive and inappropriate.  \n\nInstead of \u201cyou\u2019re not supposed to drink that! You\u2019re trading one addiction out for another\u201d \n\nShe could have said, \u201chey, I\u2019m not trying to upset you, but I\u2019m curious\u2026I\u2019ve heard that caffeine is not good for pregnancy? Is that true? Did your doctor say you could have that?\u201d Which is far less offensive and it\u2019s approached as questions rather than accusations. \n\nBut aside from that, the big picture here is that your in-laws suck. They\u2019re essentially acting like they\u2019re trying to punish you for getting sober and not letting you forget you were an alcoholic. Like you\u2019re going to be serving a life sentence they\u2019re not going to let you put behind you or forget.  \n\nAnd also, they\u2019re wrong again. You\u2019re not exhibiting \u201cdry drunk\u201d symptoms. You\u2019re exhibiting pregnancy symptoms. You\u2019re suffering from mood imbalances from hormone fluctuations. Your MIL should understand that very well. And anyone who knows anything about pregnancy hormones should understand irritability Is a given. \n\nYou need to set boundaries and tell them that you\u2019re not going to tolerate them constantly blaming everything you do on your former drinking and recovery. If you feel it\u2019s necessary, say the outcome will be LC or NC until they can treat you respectfully.", "NTA\n\nI think your family is overreacting.

No judgement, but the transition to a sober you is a change for everyone around you. \n\nFive months can seem ages as you muster the strength day after day (which congratulations for btw), but depending on how long you were going through the addiction it could be a flash in the pan for everyone else. \n\nIt could be that SIL truly does have the best of intentions and knows enough to get herself in trouble (knows that pregnant woman can only have a little bit of caffeine per day but doesn\u2019t know the exact amount). \n\nNow her comment about hoping addictions was out of line so she was for sure out of line on that.", "ESH.  i think that your SIL needs to find a way to speak to you about her concerns without being outright aggressive or passive-aggressive.  and you have to understand that you were a serious alcoholic and they are very rightfully concerned for the baby.  most families and people do not know how to communicate their thoughts and feelings in a healthy way, and it usually comes out annoying and offensive.  but when it comes to a pregnant woman, many people cannot hold their tongue, even strangers. \n\nthe way i see it, when you were a sloppy drunk, you said they were supportive of you, and you were lucky for that.  so you should give a little grace toward them now and just explain, even if it takes a few times, that you'd like them to voice their concern in a different manner.  hopefully it works out.  you and your hubby will need all the support you can get once the baby comes, and you will need extra support.  good luck!", ">Obviously it wasn't planned but I do see this as a god send.

I held my job down, never missed work and all my bills were paid on time and usually in advance. I generally drank 12-18 beers every other day, depending on whether or not my husband drank with me (he's not a big drinker but when he would drink with me I ended up drinking more than normal). It was bad enough that I never experienced hangovers. Not since I was a teen, when I started drinking really heavy. I watched my sister die when I was 13 and I had been drinking ever since. Still graduated with high honors and did well but I was drinking heavily for a very, very long time. Usually by myself, if I'm being honest. I don't even remember the last time I even went to a function or anything. It was usually just me on my back porch.\n\nI quit by my own doing. My husband, who is utterly perfect, never once made me feel like crap over my addiction but the turning point for me was like.. I felt the need to drink one night but my body was fully telling me that I did NOT want it. I did a lot of soul searching that night. I didn't go and get alcohol like I wanted and I was pissed about it. Got migraines. And I guess at that point I just realized it wasn't even fun anymore. I didn't enjoy drinking. So I quit, that night. Gave it up completely. I checked myself in to AA a few days later and got appointments with a recovery specialist and I haven't had a drop since.

OP set a boundary not allowing her SIL to continue to verbally and emotionally abuse her. She behaved just fine. Saying \u201cget out\u201d is not inappropriate. Having a screaming match and a full blown argument would have been. OP was right to respond the way she did.
