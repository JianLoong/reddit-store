My mom sister and 2 year old were with me. There was an older woman browsing the jewelry when we got there. She immediately starts talking and cooing with the baby and my baby is typically friendly so is laughing and smiling back at her. \n\nNow to note my husband and I are both mixed he is half white but looks brown as do I. Our kids however came out very light skinned. Anyway she said something along the lines of your being such a nice girl for aunty so I must of looked confused and she said she\u2019s very comfortable with you. So in chuckled and said yes she\u2019s mommy\u2019s good girl. I could tell immediately her demeanor changed. I just waved the babies hand and said bye and went to sit down. \n\nWhile I\u2019m sitting the lady brings over the selection of earrings for us to choose. The older woman sees this and asks her sales person is she piercing that babies ear loudly. The lady looks confused cause in this country most if not all girls get their ears pierced as babies. She says yes. The lady then huffs and says I wonder if the father knows about this, this why you should keep to your kind when you have kids and I\u2019m ruining the baby and if the baby is really mine. \n\nMy mom is fuming I\u2019m upset and the sales lady who is dealing with her is trying to get her to choose her piece and leave. I look at her and say that she\u2019s being racist and rude and to keep her opinions to herself. She then says what kind of mother am I and left telling the sales associate she wouldn\u2019t be back. \n\nHer associate was upset apologized to us but looked like she was crying and went to the back room. Our associate explained that she\u2019s probably upset she lost out on the commission. Now I feel like the AH and I should have held my tongue.\n\nEdit: I am not looking for a debate about ear piercing. Everyone is entitled to their opinion as parents. I don\u2019t live in the US and for all those who do and have a problem again the culture and customs are completely different. So please respect mine.\n\nEdit 2: So done with all the Americans in the comments who want to tell me about my culture and customs and how wrong it is. I\u2019m done justifying my decision I\u2019m her parent. Contrary to all y\u2019all preaching bout it\u2019s permanence if she doesn\u2019t want it she can take it out. If she\u2019s upset about it I as her parent will voice my thought process she can understand or not. It\u2019s amazing to me the woman was being racist but most of y\u2019all don\u2019t get the privilege and undertones of entitlement a American/westerner has to tell me about my culture. \n\nAs for the sales rep I will return to the store and purchase a few items so I can makeup for any commission she lost.

Was me saying something about it worth that idk. Especially if her possibly losing the sale may have gotten her in trouble. \n \nMy daughter nope. Again Americans who live in America governed by the norms and standards of American society are entitled to their opinion on how to raise their American kids. I\u2019m sure hella y\u2019all would be upset I baptised my kids to cause she can\u2019t consent. And that\u2019s my choice as a parent. It\u2019s a different society with a completely different cultural norm. It\u2019s hilarious to me though so many of y\u2019all want the moral high ground without realising the undertone or presuming to tell someone of a different culture that you a privileged American is right and I am wrong. \n\nHer ears are pierced.

What I am thoroughly annoyed about is the absolute disregard for other peoples cultures and belief system. \n My kids are baptized guess what I\u2019m Catholic and my husband is Muslim. Could they consent to that no. My husband and I made the decision to raise them exposed to both and when the time comes they can decide. I\u2019m their parent it\u2019s my job to make decisions on what I feel is best for them and do my best to not harm them.  I pierced it as a baby why cause it will heal she doesn\u2019t have to go through the pain as a teenager she doesn\u2019t have to feel left out in a society around the majority of her peers who have it done and it is a rite of passage in my family and culture. If she wants to take her earring out and have the hole closed she can do that\u2019s cause it\u2019s guess what not permanent. \n\nIt seems persons on this app are incapable of accepting dissenting opinion.

The entitlement of Americans to think they have some moral authority and high ground to tell other people what they should do because that\u2019s what they think. \n\nGuess what I don\u2019t agree with people who force their kids to be vegan or don\u2019t let their kids ever have a snack or fast food. I\u2019ve heard a ton of parents decide to do that. I don\u2019t tell them they are shit parent I simply disagree express my opinion respectfully and move on. \n\nThe entitlement y\u2019all feel is steeped in privilege. It\u2019s why so much of our culture and customs were lost because your opinions and decisions were the most important.

But you are telling me to disregard my customs and cultures as a person of color that you have no idea about. \n\nMy daughter can\u2019t consent to a lot of things. What if she grows up and decides she doesn\u2019t agree with vaccinations but she\u2019s been vaccinated. What if she grows up and decides to convert like her dad did to Islam and is annoyed that we baptized her. I had her catheterized as a baby which carry\u2019s even greater chance of infection than getting pierced but it was a necessary decision cause she was 3 months with fever and a rash . Those are all decisions I make as a parent. \n\nNo it wasn\u2019t a Claire\u2019s. It was a reputable establishment that specializes in baby piercings.

The whites in my country do not marry or have kids out of their color and class. Which is why husbands fathers family ostracized him. So when she realized those were my kids her assumption was my husband was white and he\u2019d had kids out of his race. So she got pissed and decided to go with it. Like I said the mall I went to is in a fairly high end area and most of the stores are patronized and owned by upper middle or upper class people.\n\nShe could have also been an expat because that area the only people who can afford to live and shop there are wealthy Americans who migrate or wealth locals who are most likely white", "Genuinely not. This mall was in a high end area most of the stores are owned by 2-3 families and they are all notorious for underpaying their workers. Colonialism is still alive and well in some parts of the world.

It's abusive to deny healthcare.", "Ok so NTA first of all, that lady was way out of line. As for the ears pierced. My aunt took me to get them pierced when I was 2 years old. My mom was furious and took them off immediatly and the holes closed themselves over time. I decided to get them pierced again at 17. That's when I understood why some people do that to babies. As a baby, you won't remember the pain and you can still choose later on if you want to wear earing or not. \n\nI personally think that you shouldn't pierced the ear of a child under 2 years old. But ti each their own.\n\nIn my country plenty of professionals refuse to touch the ears of a baby under 15 month.\n\nAs for everyone who tell you (in not so polite term) that your opinion is wrong.

I also disagree with circumcising babies for the same reason and its a common practice in the US.", "Nah, permanent body modification without someone\u2019s permission is always wrong.", "Ah yes, because violating bodily autonomy for aesthetic purposes makes it okay.", "This is my assumption so don't come at me (or come at me IDC)\n\nYou know when you're poor, you decide to push some racist/sexist remarks towards you (or other customers in this case) aside because you're about to make about \u20ac100-200 in commission and after the sale goes through (or not in this case) you look back and feel a little bit of disgust that you've allowed yourself to be a bad person for money.

Everyone\u2019s up in arms about piercing a baby\u2019s ears bc \u2018bodily autonomy\u2019 but the way American society regards children in other ways- lack of abortion rights, safety in schools- is strange to me.

It's a decision for someone a bit older than 2 years old. Plus, it wasn't done by a piercer (with a hollow needle, not a piercing gun). No piercer would agree to pierce a little kid's ears. You should have waited till' she's old enough to speak for herself. The culture is NOT an excuse for doing smth like that to a person who doesn't even understand what's going on around them.

I would argue that in this situation (piercing) it\u2019s not about what\u2019s best, it\u2019s about following what you want to do based on your experiences and those around you.

It\u2019s not a cultural difference.\n\nThe point is you\u2019re still taking away a choice for a permanent body modification. More importantly you are subjecting a very young child to pain when they can\u2019t understand the reason for it, and for cosmetic purposes too. It\u2019s also not a big deal to wait until they can decide.\n\nVeganism and fast food isn\u2019t quite the same because veganism is a moral belief. It\u2019s more akin to religion and expecting a vegan to buy and cook meat has a lot of baggage (although I do agree that it\u2019s often too risky for young kids to be vegan), and fast food snacks is about health. Whereas piercing ears is cosmetic and inflicts pain.", "100% of Spartan citizen boys were torn away from their families at the age of 7 and kept away until they were adults.  During that time, they were starved, physically and sexually abused, and encouraged to steal and abuse each other.  Some unknown percentage of these boys died during this process.  Some unknown percentage of these boys (the older ones) were encouraged to go out into the countryside and murder slaves as part of this process.  The survivors returned to their families emotionally and mentally scarred from their experiences.\n\nAnd yet the Spartans considered this the perfect method for raising boys.  Spartan citizen men boasted of how great the agoge (which is the name of this process) was, and perpetuated it for AT LEAST 300 YEARS.\n\nWould you consider this to be a morally acceptable way to raise boys?  Would you consider someone who condemned this process as engaging in entitlement and privilege?  Are we (you and I), who come from vastly different cultures from the Spartan one, not allowed to make a moral judgment on them for how they treated these boys?\n\nCulture can only excuse so much.  Bodily autonomy is a BASIC human right and children under a certain age CANNOT consent as a BIOLOGICAL FACT.  Women who don\u2019t get their ears pierced as babies can still get their ears pierced as adults.  They lose NOTHING by waiting.\n\nNTA on the question you ask, but I fully agree that YTA for piercing your babies ears and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a matter of entitlement or privilege to point out that forcing permanent scarring on an individual who CANNOT consent is abuse.", "Lol. The fact that it is done does not make it right. I'm not even western, idk where'd you get that info from. If it wasn't done with a piercing gun, then sorry, given the context it seemed obvious to me. However it's still just not ok to modify a 2 year old's body, and No culture makes it right. Consent is needed for things like that. Do you really think that piercing a few weeks old infant's ears is fine??\n\nPS. Where exactly did I \"shit on\" you?", "Hi following me to disagree  because I commented on your ridiculous take earlier. You bored or something?\n\nIt's a bit sad and pathetic don't you think?", "Not permanent", "Permanent, huh?", "Right. So what about haircuts?? The baby can\u2019t consent, and that\u2019s a modification. \n\nCutting the child\u2019s fingernails?! Can\u2019t consent to that either, and that\u2019s a modification. \n\nYour logic is shit, infants can\u2019t knowingly consent to anything!", "my culture does this too. it is ear piercings, doesn't hurt, and vanish if you don't wear your earrings for a while. a small earring. it is mostly religious. i agree something being a part of a culture does not excuse everything but this is definitely not one of those scenarios, ear piercings are common here and almost every girl has one, its weird \\*not\\* to. a lot of your US piercing culture you got from countries like mine, and they are viewed differently there, not as a norm. try to understand this. of course parents make a lot of decisions on behalf of their children until they can make their own. it would be wrong to force the child to still have a piercing if they dont want one when they can start expressing their opinions. a parent chooses what type of school a child goes to, what clothes to wear, their religion, and often the practices that come along with it. this is not a well thought out opinion you have", "Then you\u2019re against all temporary body modifications, right? \n\nNo personal grooming, haircuts, or nail trims\u2026 we certainly wouldn\u2019t want you to change an infant\u2019s appearance without their consent.", "I'm in the USA and had my daughters ears pierced when she was a little over a year old. She didn't even cry. I had no idea this was something people disapprove of. This was back in the 90s, and every mom I knew had their babies' ears pierced.\nAlso, as a former commission salesperson, you did the right thing. Racists deserve to be called out, period. NTA", "This made me chuckle I was beginning to wonder. \n\nIt really rubbed me the wrong way. Because I had a friend from funnily enough the Midwest who would constantly make fun of the Caribbean and Caribbean ppl. When I mentioned how we pierced babies ears he said it made babies look like hookers. It always felt rooted in this air of superiority and entitlement. Kinda like we are heathers and savages and the American way is the only way", "This might be the worst post I\u2019ve ever fucking read. \n\nFor real, just compared Spartan practices (which it appears you took from a major motion picture and not from historical fact) of sexual and physical abuse, with a bit of torture, to piercing an infant\u2019s ears. \n\nI get you\u2019re not claiming they\u2019re equal and are showing how one can judge another culture, but to put those things in the same sentence is just absolutely ridiculous and offensive. \n\nBtw, you realize, without language and understanding of conceptual idea, babies at that age cannot consent to anything, right?", "Abuse wow y\u2019all are so rich. Compare an ear piercing to spartan sacrifice. Some of y\u2019all seriously need to leave the privilege and comfort of the US and experience different places. Because y\u2019all are so damn sure your way is the only way. \n\nNotice I\u2019m not telling you you have to pierce your kids ears. But you are telling me eff your customs culture i the great and all knowing white man knows better. WOW", "So you believe piercing a child's ears is equivalent to the abuse the Spartans perpetuated? Way to overreact. Around 70% of people in the US circumcise their boys. That's far more abusive than ear piercing which, if left alone for enough time, does heal over so isn't a permanent choice.\n\nYour entire rambling post adds nothing to the conversation except an attempt to shame other cultures. You must be proud.", "Because they corrected you for saying something completely incorrect? You seem secure and confident in who you are as a person.", "Ok and do you know how many cultures and countries think differently than you. There was a tiktok video I saw recently about a south Asian country (I can\u2019t remember which) and the girl was speaking about a custom for piercing the girls ears with a needle and black string and the fact she was honoring her customs. \n\nSo you don\u2019t think it\u2019s right but there are millions of people that disagree with you. The issue is you want to unequivocally state mine is in fact superior and therefore I am right. More than one way of life can coexist that\u2019s my issue. I could care less if you agree with me or not. It\u2019s the inability for differing views to coexist", "Those things are health related and don't cause physical harm. Cutting nails specifically is done to avoid harm. \n\nI don't think she is abusive or anything for getting her kids ears pierced, but I do believe that it is wrong to do. It's common where I live as well, as is circumcision. Both are wrong, doesn't mean I think people doing it are bad people or parents. \n\nPlus, even if you do want your ears pierced later in life, it sucks to have the ones done as a baby grow in lopsided.", "I don\u2019t have the issues many people have with piercing an infant\u2019s ears. It\u2019s not a decision I would make, but I think it\u2019s relatively minor issue in the face of many other things I disagree with, re the care of infants.\n\nThat said, I hate when people talk about piercings like they\u2019re temporary things. I haven\u2019t worn earrings since I was a child, which was decades ago. Despite that, I still have noticeable (uneven) pocks in my lobes, and they were so badly damaged that I have lumps in them always & that get inflamed and painful when I\u2019m sick.\n\nAgain, pierce your kids ears, genuinely could not care less, but comparing it to cutting hair or nails is off too.", "I agree. I had no idea that piercing a baby was so polarizing until I came to Reddit.", "Ignore them. They're being ridiculous. NTA and I hope your little one rocks those pierced ears!", "Abuse is abuse.  And FTR, I am NOT a white man.", "They can think differently all they like, doesn't mean other people won't think they are assholes for it. You specifically came to this sub and website where half of the users are from the US alone. You are obviously going to be getting western opinions. If that isn't what you want then I'd suggest posting elsewhere. NTA for calling the woman racist though. Have you ever heard of Chinese foot binding? Would you say that forcibly doing that to children is ok just because it was their culture? If yes, you're cruel and sadistic. If no, you're a hypocrite.", "Or you could send someone unknown to them so it doesn\u2019t cause any possible backlash.", "Where do you live? Where did this opinion stem from? When I said white man sorry I didn\u2019t mean literally white man I meant the society of the white man. \n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t negate my point which is that who are you to tell anyone there culture and societal norms are wrong based on your own societies opinions. That\u2019s is a sense of privilege and entitlement to think my way is the only way I am the superior one. I as the American/westerner (hence terminology of white man) knows best.\n\nAnd that is insulting to actual abuse victims. My dad kicked my moms ass because he was alcoholic. He attacked me and my siblings when we tried to intervene. My daughter who I love and adore and would literally lay my life down for km abusing her simply because you disagree with me but you are right because your society is superior and better right", "You\u2019ve already tacitly admitted that it\u2019s okay to judge another cultural practice by your own cultural values.  You had no problem condemning the Spartans, who (if they were still around) would be making the EXACT SAME ARGUMENT YOU ARE MAKING AGAINST YOU.\n\nSo, you\u2019re a hypocrite for applying YOUR moral values against another culture and still complaining when someone applies their moral values against YOUR culture.\n\nWith that said, it NO LONGER MATTERS what race I am, what gender I am, or what culture I am from.  You have ADMITTED that there are moral absolutes and the inability of children to consent to permanent scarring (absent a medical need, which ear piercing IS NOT) is one of them.  Of course I\u2019m not going to be able to convince you of that any more than you could convince a Spartan that what they were doing is wrong.  So I\u2019m going to disengage from you after this.\n\nEnjoy your hypocrisy.", "Where are you from exactly? Because for someone who bemoans America so much, you sure do write like an American, vernacular and everything. This post is a little sus.", "It\u2019s NOT permanent. Now you\u2019re just making shit up to fit your own twisted narrative. Nice.", "Lol born and raised in the Caribbean. Not sure what makes me sound like an American. But then again our local dialect isn\u2019t readily typed to be understood by the masses. Should I insert a bomboclat for good measure", "Huh, no kidding? I really thought I had you pegged as some Midwest American. Well shit, in that case f the haters and get your baby some earrings. \n\nP.S. You can throw in a bomboclat if you want to.", "OP, you're NTA!\n\nBorn and raised in a country with a colonial background as well and culture practices similar enough where I also had my ears pierced as a baby - no memory whatsoever.\n\nFunnily enough when I was between 4 and 5, my earrings would bother me while sleeping on my side, so one day I decided to take them off. Took a while, and I ruined the gold earrings in the process. For a while, I didn't wear any and the holes healed over. My mum took me to our paediatrician and she re-pierced my ears. Funnily enough, I remember that process - the gun (yes, **the gun**, OMGWHAAA?!) was what scared me the most. My ma then requested me to not pull out the earrings on my own again - asked me what kind I found comfortable and only ever made me wear those. In fact in my teens when I wanted to wear heavier, longer pieces she would always discourage me saying it was the right time yet.\n\nIgnore the nonsensical comments equating your choice to abuse and SPARTAN practices from the BC times (what even?!!?!) I know where you come from. For someone who has been reading posts about future brides whinging and crying about colour coordinating their guests' outfits and making sure no one wears **her** colour, to making up ridiculous rules for guests, to parents demanding rent from their children... yeah we're supposed to just read on and keep our opinions to ourselves because HEY THIS IS THE WAY, when my upbringing and culture (and for millions of people out there) tells me that these notions are ridiculous, mental and bordering on abuse too.\n\nMy best to you and your daughter, OP. I'm so sorry you had to go through the experience that led to you posting here in the first place, and also for the nonsense people who can't grasp different cultures have thrown your way today. More power to you and to being different.\n\nOh and I hope people realise the far reaching effects of colonialism and American media such that it's a part of a LOT of people's day to day lives and their vernacular and mannerisms will reflect it. Doesn't mean that we suddenly abdicate our local customs and cultures. It's not an either/or situation, most of the times it's intermingled.", "I am actually clapping you right now. This every single word here this. Thank you so much you actually said everything I wanted to eat better thank I could"]}
