My mom sister and 2 year old were with me. There was an older woman browsing the jewelry when we got there. She immediately starts talking and cooing with the baby and my baby is typically friendly so is laughing and smiling back at her. \n\nNow to note my husband and I are both mixed he is half white but looks brown as do I. Our kids however came out very light skinned. Anyway she said something along the lines of your being such a nice girl for aunty so I must of looked confused and she said she\u2019s very comfortable with you. So in chuckled and said yes she\u2019s mommy\u2019s good girl. I could tell immediately her demeanor changed. I just waved the babies hand and said bye and went to sit down. \n\nWhile I\u2019m sitting the lady brings over the selection of earrings for us to choose. The older woman sees this and asks her sales person is she piercing that babies ear loudly. The lady looks confused cause in this country most if not all girls get their ears pierced as babies. She says yes. The lady then huffs and says I wonder if the father knows about this, this why you should keep to your kind when you have kids and I\u2019m ruining the baby and if the baby is really mine. \n\nMy mom is fuming I\u2019m upset and the sales lady who is dealing with her is trying to get her to choose her piece and leave. I look at her and say that she\u2019s being racist and rude and to keep her opinions to herself. She then says what kind of mother am I and left telling the sales associate she wouldn\u2019t be back. \n\nHer associate was upset apologized to us but looked like she was crying and went to the back room. Our associate explained that she\u2019s probably upset she lost out on the commission. Now I feel like the AH and I should have held my tongue.\n\nEdit: I am not looking for a debate about ear piercing. Everyone is entitled to their opinion as parents. I don\u2019t live in the US and for all those who do and have a problem again the culture and customs are completely different.

The fact that there are legal options to both drastically, (circumcision for example) or not-as-drastically (piercings) change a person\u2019s body without their say so for unnecessary reasons, it\u2019s absolutely insane to me.

Free Speech protects you from being persecuted by the government for speaking out against the government.  That\u2019s it.  Additionally, if you\u2019d read the post fully, you\u2019d know that OP is not American and does not live in the US.\n\nOP is definitely NTA, but I\u2019m so sick of Americans not even understanding their own constitution.  \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "In confronting the woman I\u2019m 50/50 do I think the older woman should be saying that no.

I felt bad because I don\u2019t know the circumstances of the sales rep for her to be upset like that if it was a big sale if she was depending on the money for something in particular. Was me saying something about it worth that idk. Especially if her possibly losing the sale may have gotten her in trouble. \n \nMy daughter nope. Again Americans who live in America governed by the norms and standards of American society are entitled to their opinion on how to raise their American kids. I\u2019m sure hella y\u2019all would be upset I baptised my kids to cause she can\u2019t consent. And that\u2019s my choice as a parent. It\u2019s a different society with a completely different cultural norm. It\u2019s hilarious to me though so many of y\u2019all want the moral high ground without realising the undertone or presuming to tell someone of a different culture that you a privileged American is right and I am wrong. \n\nHer ears are pierced. She was laughing and smiling within 5 minutes of it being done. It\u2019s being properly taken care of. If you disagree with me on that it\u2019s great we are all entitled to differing opinions", "Hey you are entitled to your opinion. What I am thoroughly annoyed about is the absolute disregard for other peoples cultures and belief system. \n My kids are baptized guess what I\u2019m Catholic and my husband is Muslim. Could they consent to that no. My husband and I made the decision to raise them exposed to both and when the time comes they can decide. I\u2019m their parent it\u2019s my job to make decisions on what I feel is best for them and do my best to not harm them.  I pierced it as a baby why cause it will heal she doesn\u2019t have to go through the pain as a teenager she doesn\u2019t have to feel left out in a society around the majority of her peers who have it done and it is a rite of passage in my family and culture. If she wants to take her earring out and have the hole closed she can do that\u2019s cause it\u2019s guess what not permanent. \n\nIt seems persons on this app are incapable of accepting dissenting opinion. I must have missed the memo where everyone had to have the same opinion on things.", "Do you know anyone who has? \n\nI live in a country where 95% of girls has their ears pierced. Went to school with them you know what we didn\u2019t talk about how pissed we were with our moms for doing. Know what the ones who didn\u2019t get it done complain about the fact their moms didn\u2019t do it and they now have to get it done as an adult and feel anxiety and pain. \n\nKindly if you don\u2019t know anything about another cultures customs comment on it. The entitlement of Americans to think they have some moral authority and high ground to tell other people what they should do because that\u2019s what they think. \n\nGuess what I don\u2019t agree with people who force their kids to be vegan or don\u2019t let their kids ever have a snack or fast food. I\u2019ve heard a ton of parents decide to do that. I don\u2019t tell them they are shit parent I simply disagree express my opinion respectfully and move on. \n\nThe entitlement y\u2019all feel is steeped in privilege. It\u2019s why so much of our culture and customs were lost because your opinions and decisions were the most important. It\u2019s why so many of y\u2019all feel the need to comment despite the judgement on this post having nothing to do with whether my daughter had her ears pierced.", "Ok so you are probably an American whose entitled to their opinion sure and you do you with your own kids. But you are telling me to disregard my customs and cultures as a person of color that you have no idea about. \n\nMy daughter can\u2019t consent to a lot of things. What if she grows up and decides she doesn\u2019t agree with vaccinations but she\u2019s been vaccinated. What if she grows up and decides to convert like her dad did to Islam and is annoyed that we baptized her. I had her catheterized as a baby which carry\u2019s even greater chance of infection than getting pierced but it was a necessary decision cause she was 3 months with fever and a rash . Those are all decisions I make as a parent. \n\nNo it wasn\u2019t a Claire\u2019s. It was a reputable establishment that specializes in baby piercings. They also carry custom gold and diamond jewellry (hence the woman there). I have never in my entire life living in this country met a single girl and 95% of girls get pierced and say damn my mom shouldn\u2019t have done that because I couldn\u2019t consent. I have however met those who say I wish I had it done as a baby so I didn\u2019t have the pain and anxiety as an adult. \n\nAmericans / Westerners need to stop with this moral high ground of thinking just because you have an opinion of something that makes it right and you get to demonized anyone with a conflicting view as your own.", "You do understand that there are customs and cultures outside of the US. Your opinion is just that your opinion. I respect your right to have one but there isn\u2019t only one right way.", "But they look so cute", "My opinion I live in a country that is still inherently steeped in colonialism. The whites in my country do not marry or have kids out of their color and class. Which is why husbands fathers family ostracized him. So when she realized those were my kids her assumption was my husband was white and he\u2019d had kids out of his race. So she got pissed and decided to go with it. Like I said the mall I went to is in a fairly high end area and most of the stores are patronized and owned by upper middle or upper class people.\n\nShe could have also been an expat because that area the only people who can afford to live and shop there are wealthy Americans who migrate or wealth locals who are most likely white", "Genuinely not. This mall was in a high end area most of the stores are owned by 2-3 families and they are all notorious for underpaying their workers. Colonialism is still alive and well in some parts of the world. In hind sight I honestly felt as though I should have kept my mouth shut and not deprive this poor girl of her commission especially when the cost of living is so high. And as point of reference most of these mall workers make maybe $2-3USD an hr.", "Maybe she felt bad she didn\u2019t speak up and that\u2019s why she cried and apologized.

It's abusive to deny healthcare.", "Ok so NTA first of all, that lady was way out of line. As for the ears pierced. My aunt took me to get them pierced when I was 2 years old. My mom was furious and took them off immediatly and the holes closed themselves over time. I decided to get them pierced again at 17. That's when I understood why some people do that to babies. As a baby, you won't remember the pain and you can still choose later on if you want to wear earing or not. \n\nI personally think that you shouldn't pierced the ear of a child under 2 years old. But ti each their own.\n\nIn my country plenty of professionals refuse to touch the ears of a baby under 15 month.\n\nAs for everyone who tell you (in not so polite term) that your opinion is wrong. You are the mother. You know what is right or wrong for your daughter until such a time when she will be capable of making her own choices or express herself to you for you to give her advice.\n\nOther people opinion doesn't matter.", "Culture doesn't make it right. \n\nI'm part of a culture that does that and acknowledge that permanent body modifications on a baby for aesthetics is unethical.", "I know there are but it doesn\u2019t make them ethical. Plenty of people in the US pierce their baby\u2019s ears and I will always disagree with that since it\u2019s not something a baby can consent to. I also disagree with circumcising babies for the same reason and its a common practice in the US.", "Nah, permanent body modification without someone\u2019s permission is always wrong.", "Ah yes, because violating bodily autonomy for aesthetic purposes makes it okay.", "This is my assumption so don't come at me (or come at me IDC)\n\nYou know when you're poor, you decide to push some racist/sexist remarks towards you (or other customers in this case) aside because you're about to make about \u20ac100-200 in commission and after the sale goes through (or not in this case) you look back and feel a little bit of disgust that you've allowed yourself to be a bad person for money. Retail work sucks sometimes.\n\nAgain, not saying this happened, but it could be one of the reasons.", "I\u2019m not mad she didn\u2019t say anything. The persons who own those stores would have probably reprimanded her or fired her for offending a customer. And it\u2019s why I wondered if I should have just bit my tongue cause my sales rep would have gotten about $600-$700 on commission and we bought baby/children\u2019s items which are cheaper as they weigh less. \n\nI was contemplating going back and just buying some things for myself and giving her the sale but I have had the same sales rep for a while.", "I\u2019m sure your rep would understand a one time purchase like that"]}
