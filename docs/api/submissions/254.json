Also! He ordered you a drink as well. Should she yell about that too? I mean, a part of me could understand if suddenly you ordered four very complicated drinks/sandwiches that made the line slow up for the next ten or so minutes, but still, your boyfriend was in line first, he can order whatever he wants, and that is that.\n\nYeah definitely not in the wrong here; the lady behind you needs to have her head adjusted.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m from the UK, I get they felt upset but it\u2019s not uncommon for someone to stand in a queue and order for their partner too. \n\nThey just wanted to make you feel bad - sorry, they don\u2019t represent most people here (at least I hope so). Sometimes people with kids are a little irrational about what other people should be doing for them", "NTA- The queue is for paying customers. Your bf was in the line specifically to purchase your order. Would they also be upset if your bf knew to order the brownie when he entered? The parent was just upset that their child didn\u2019t get a brownie and they will have to deal with the effects of that.", "NTA, geez. Bad luck for the family, but there's nothing wrong with asking your SO to buy you something while they're queuing.", "That's an interesting concept, and there may be cultural differences too but where I'm from, often just the one person waits and orders for two (or sometimes even more) and no one bats an eye. It's just the logical thing to do. Why would you unnecessarily crowd the shop/queue when one person can handle that so the other person can go take care of whatever they need to do or just make themselves comfortable outside/at a table. NTA", "It was the last brownie, many scenarios could have \"stolen\" it away from the kid: anyone extra ordering a brownie earlier that day, your BF ordering one, you texting for it to your BF,....\n\nShit happens, NTA.", "NTA this is exactly how me and my husband would have behaved and we're both UKdians.", "NTA. Hope the brownie did make you feel better!", "NTA. This isn\u2019t jumping the queue though. Nick was the only one to place an order and pay. Parents and their kids are honestly the worst.", "NTA this isn't jumping the que", "NTA. You did not jump the queue. You were with Nick, who was already in the queue. Your friends with children are assholes for thinking you were an asshole in that situation. Not everything in the world revolves around children. Sometimes the woman with cramps gets the last brownie -- because her boyfriend was already in the queue.", "NTA you didn't jump the queue, you just spoke to your boyfriend and added to the order. I also live in the UK and this is normal to do.", "NTA\n\nAssuming bf already had an order (drink) he was going to get for you there is no queue \"jumping\" here.\n\nThat's the way the queue works! One person who is ordering for several can stand in the queue and until they're actually placing their order the others they are ordering for can add or modify what they've requested. What difference does it make if you walk up to your bf and modify what you want him to get or if you text him from the table you've grabbed!", "NTA, it's perfectly acceptable and reasonable for Nick to order for you as well as himself, by the woman's reasoning her daughter is also queue jumping if her mother is ordering for herself and her daughter. The hypocrisy runs deep with this one lol. Don't worry about it and anyone saying you are in the wrong is an idiot too. I am in uk and the woman was definitely wrong  :)", "NTA - if it was me, and I was feeling crappy, I 100% would have sat at the coffee shop and texted my husband to get \"xyz.\" The mother wouldn't have complained then. She is just upset because now she has to discipline her child instead of getting her a treat. That kid is too old for throwing a tantrum in public. (Yes I have kids, one of them is literally 7 turning 8 very soon.)", "NTA, asking someone already in the queue to order you something is not in any way jumping the queue.", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't jump the queue, your behavior was perfectly normal.\n\nYour friends with kids aren't basing their attitudes on what's right, they're all imagining themselves in that line with a child who is upset or having a tantrum because the brownie is gone, and they see that situation as frustrating.   But that's not your problem and they have no right to make it yours.", "NTA, why are your parent-friends so entitled? Imagine you sent him a message beforehand to get you the brownie, same concept, different execution. They can't expect people not to order something just because their precious one would want one too", "NTA you didn\u2019t jump the queue, you were together, and ordered together. She\u2019s just bitter.", "I'd say NTA, but then again, in the UK they have some serious stuff going on about queues, so ... No. You didn't jump queue. NTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You followed the rules of queuing as they apply in the UK and you didn\u2019t do anything wrong here. You could have been generous and given the child the brownie if they had asked nicely but you were by no means obligated to.

The mother\u2019s stress was misplaced.", "NTA you didn\u2019t jump the que your partner was in line you added to the order that\u2019s not jumping.

The shop was also an AH for saying you guys got the last one and made it seem like they should speak with you if they wanted the brownie still.", "I was going to lean into the whole \"We British love our queuing\" angle but NTA. This shit happens all the time. That kid needs to learn the disappointments of life at some point. You didn't queue jump and I'm sure there are plenty of other cakes for that kid to eat.", "NTA. Good brownie instinct isn\u2019t a bad thing, if the kid wanted it bad enough they wouldn\u2019t have tried harder. Hope it was a 10/10 brownie.", "NTA You could have easily told him ahead of time to get you a brownie. Or texted him to get you one. Neither of those are line jumping. You didn't line jump at all", "NTA. Monster Mommy can deal with it.", "NTA", "You should have told her, \"Nice language.  Do you kiss your child with that mouth?\"\n\nNTA, but the mother sure was.", "NTA. She was just bitter and looking for an excuse.", "NTA.  Nick was getting you a drink and you asked him to add the brownie to the order.  You didn't 'jump the queue', you just expanded the order.\n\nI love (/s) how those with children call you an AH because *their precious spawn aren't being lauded as gods gifts to humankind and everyone isn't bending over backwards to make them happy*.", "it\u2019s not like you knew they were going to order it? NTA", "NTA but I hope you enjoyed that brownie thoroughly in front of the mom! He ordered drinks and snacks for the two of you after waiting his turn in line.", "Lol, yes, this. Haha! I hope OP reads this one. Try asking your friends if the whole family should get in line to buy their food. Your parent friends are being entitled with their judgment. Also, would that parent have a problem with you \"jumping the line\" if your boyfriend received a text message or call instead of you personally requesting your order to him?", "NTA. It's just the same as texting your bf for the additional order.", "Yeah, this isn't a \"her not understanding British queuing rules\" thing, this is an entitled mother thing. She did nothing wrong and the mom needs to learn the world doesn't revolve around what her kids want.", "I'm from the UK, no cultural differences, the moms behaviour is insane. No one expects every individual to queue.", "Because crowding the line/queue with 8 people when only 1 is getting something is a very American thing to do.  As someone who has lived here for almost 10 years and done a lot of retail in both Canada and the USA, it just happens here.", "My mom never promised us anything in terms of treats. If we were at Walmart and behaving, sometimes she would let us pick out a candy at checkout. Not always, but sometimes. (We would stare longingly at it the whole time until she either said yes or we started unloading the cart for the cashier to scan, but if we asked the answer was usually no). \n\nBut yeah, going to a Cafe or store and them being out of something is out of your control. Is the kid right to be disappointed? Sure. Who isn't disappointed when the thing they wanted is out? But like you said, they're old enough to not throw a tantrum about it.", "But this isn't happening in the US or Canada and in the UK that's not normal", "I understand that.  I was remarking on the comment that I responded to. Why would people do that? Culturally some people do but no it\u2019s normal in Canada or the UK.  I\u2019m sure many people who are used to organized queues would go bananas as a US airport."]}
