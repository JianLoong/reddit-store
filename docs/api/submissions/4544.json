OP needs to communicate with him about their kid.", "Presumably she would have been smart enough to pick up the phone is someone is approaching 20+ calls to her.", "OP would likely pick up a call from a random number when her child isn't with her because most people with small children are aware they are the primary contacts in an emergency and may not know every number they can come from", "Who calls 20 times before figuring out maybe use a different phone?", "It didn\u2019t sound like anything happening was so emergent that she couldn\u2019t call, it sounds like she just didn\u2019t want to. ESH. She\u2019s acting like a child and you\u2019re dense if you don\u2019t pick up when some kind of relative calls you 20 times.", "The judge would probably say that asking her brother to call was perfectly responsible, since that way she could stay with her kid who was injured and probably scared.", "Imagine if the child had an accident and didn\u2019t make it and dad misses saying goodbye because mum was too immature to pick up the phone and call him herself?", "Actually, usually it\u2019s my mum with a \u201cburning\u201d question she might forget and here\u2019s me freaking out because I think someone is dead.

You still call if your kid is in hospital.", "THIS", "Plus in one comment op told us her brother is friends with ex so he has his number saved. Idky but he didn't pick up. That was his choice and he chose poorly.", "But that's not what happened? \n\nThis was OP being petty about calling or texting on their own phone because she didn't want to communicate herself because its tense and awkward. \n\nI can bet that the ex wouldn't be upset if your hypothetical had occurred, but those weren't the circumstances of why OP didn't call herself.", "She needs to keep him informed. She doesn't need to personally tell him. There's a difference. \n\nHe needs to freaking know when people are calling. For starters, he cannot assume that OP won't get injured in an accident and then what? His daughter just wouldn't have a parent there until they can figure out the right person to call him?\n\nEx is not bright and needs a new system. OP's focus needs to be her daughter in the hospital", "I was appalled at what I was seeing posted so I had to say something.", "If I saw ANYONE trying to call me 10+ times back to back, I'd be calling back right away. Shit, I probably would after the 3rd one. You have no way of knowing what the circumstance is, it could be a car accident, medical emergency, who knows? But no one within a reasonable arm's length of sanity calls that many times in a row unless it's seriously urgent, and you need to pick up now.", "No. Call him yourself.", "Yeah, not really. Using the kid's uncle as an intermediary between the parents, who actually have agency over the kid's medical outcomes, because \"things are rough between us\" when you know your ex is just going to show up to the hospital *anyway* is myopic at best and outright juvenile at worst. \n\nWas this designed to be the most effective solution to the problem, or was it designed to give you plausible deniability when it failed?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA.", "She isn't.", "Have you never heard of professional jobs where your phone has to be in a specific setting that only emergency contacts can ring through?", "Apparently OP\u2019s brother, but we\u2019re not voting on him.", "Who says he didn't leave a message? If the ex was on DND, he probably wasn't checking for messages, either.", "Or...get this...on the way to the hospital, she could have contacted him.  Just as any parent would want to be informed about an emergency like that, she should have done her due diligence and informed him.  PARTICULARLY since she knows he only accepts specific callers while at work!  Hell, she could have handed her phone to her brother initially and told him to call off that!\n\nI think a judge would not be amused that she put her discomfort above her responsibility to inform the other parent.", "Then it\u2019s on you if you don\u2019t get information in an emergency situation.", "Not if she felt like he was a threat to her safety wtf", "I\u2019ve had over a dozen spam calls from the same number before in rapid succession. Many ignore calls without an id on them cause of the spam problem, especially if they don\u2019t leave messages.", "Eh.

Possibly missing very important phone calls related to your kid is the price you pay for that uninterrupted \"focus time\" at work.", "So what... if the hospital had to call instead would  you still be screeching that it's her fault he wouldn't answer the phone? \n\nIf he's going to have a kid he should be more prepared to answer more than just one phone number in case of an emergency", "You can turn that off now too. You can set it up with only certain people able to get through. If everyone could get through with two calls and the majority of people know that there would be no point to even have do not disturb. That's why they changed it because people were calling multiple times for non sense just so they could get through do not disturb.", "> Phone\u2019s put them through after the 2nd ring back to back.\n\nWhat confidence to say something that you have absolutely no way of knowing.", "Why would the ex have OP's brother on their phone? If anything ex might have thought it was a spam caller and blocked it.", "How is he in the wrong for not answering the call of his ex wife's brother? He answered immediately once his co-parents number called him, thats just normal behavior to not answer the phone number you don't recognize especially with all the robot spam calls that we all get nowadays.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP is the only person in the wrong here, how dare she think that her discomfort (no abuse mentioned) with her Ex is a good enough reason to not tell the father of her child that their kid is in the fucking hospital?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhatever crazy pills you are on sound like fun, I'd love a handful if you have some extra.", "I have my phone setup to only allow that for specific people. If you're not on my list, you can call me a thousand times and it's not coming through. She could have called them when they were on the way to the hospital or at the hospital.", "This. My FIL won't talk to me (long ridiculous story involving MIL). When my husband was in the hospital (all better now!) I called FIL and left a message and sent a text with the hospital info and phone #. I don't much like FIL either for his bigoted views and crazy conspiracy theories, but hell it's his son and I wouldn't feel right if I didn't let him know.", "So, if both your parents got injured and a stranger was panic calling you, you wouldn't figure it out then. Multiple calls from the same number in a short time frame is typically an emergency, you know...", "Op had brother call. So she did have him notified by proxy. So, no. She did infact attemp to have the EX contacted.", "The daughter does not seem very young imo. But ofc I might be wrong.\n\nCall ex's mom, or someone else more likely to get through DnD? Use wifes phone? There are other options", "How can someone answer a phone when the **call doesn\u2019t reach them**?", "Sounds like OP & ex were together for a while so it makes sense that he would have his own relationships with her relatives & have their numbers to communicate with them instead of always going through OP.", "Sounds like OP & ex were together for a while so it makes sense that he would have his own relationships with her relatives & have their numbers to communicate with them instead of always going through OP.", "Okay, so maybe the shirt you put aside is the not-answering-the-phone-ringing-off-the-hook? She had someone make the call. She did her duty.", "Then OP needs to be informed who he will answer to. She's not a mind reader. If there's am emergency, there's a high chance a call will come from somewhere else. OP needs to keep him informed, but they are not together and she has zero obligation to do so personally. She just needs to make sure someone is. Ex has zero right to demand personal contact.", "Why obviously? They're friends and BIL may watch the daughter sometimes.", "Not really. OP probably called more when they were together because it made sense to. If this is the first time running into the situation where someone else called, then there's no way to know without being directly told. Recent separation, this is very plausible", "Exactly. It's his responsibility as a father to fix this.", "\"Sorry I think there might be an emergency, gotta take this\"\n\nYup, completely normal.", "My local hospital doesn\u2019t allow it, but I agree that a text would have been a good move. That said, if she was with her kid and thought that her brother had already made contact (which is a reasonable assumption, imo), I don\u2019t know why she would have texted.", "My sister was with her partner for 6 years and I never had his phone number and he never had mine. We communicated over Facebook messenger only.", "I think you're making a bigger assumption than you realize. \n\nYou likely have positive in-law relationships, because there are many, many people who do not have their in-laws contact info readily accessible/in their phones. And bad in-law relationships are incredibly common. \n\nFuck, I have a just-ok relationship with my in-laws and either a) only have them on Facebook or b) do not have them saved in my phone. And its been 7 years. \n\nEveryone is different, but I wouldn't assume that OP should've just had the BIL's number saved.", "Her duty isn\u2019t getting someone else to do her duty for her. Her duty as a parent is to notify the other parent of serious news like that. OP needs to grow up and realize that her ex will always be in her life, because of their kid. She needs to get used to it.", "obviously because his calls didn't go through to the ex.\n\nLogically because if he is babysitting he's probably instructed to call OP. Friends are not often on the priority list for DnD when you have family close by.", "Everyone keeps saying that the ex should have gotten it by the \"10th call\". But nobody seems to acknowledge that there should *not* have been a 10th call. If you are able to call, delegate to someone else and they cannot get in touch, you take over. Especially in such cases.", "That\u2019s you. I have both my BIL\u2019s numbers; we text all the time. But that\u2019s me. It\u2019s going to come down to people\u2019s preferences. To me it\u2019s not weird to have their numbers & to you it is.", "Sure, but she can delegate it. Plenty of divorced parents delegate all communications to lawyers.", "He *is* family, though. Ex's daughter is his niece.", "Family to the daughter and an occasional care taker. This is not a random friend", "As you said, I was just giving an example of how not everyone has each others numbers because they communicate through different means like Facebook or What\u2019s App. Everyone does it differently. \n\nI don\u2019t find it weird for people to have their in laws numbers, for me it was I didn\u2019t like this guy much and I\u2019m not mad they broke up lol.", "For the vast majority of instances I agree yes. For emergency\u2019s no. Call them yourself. Some things are more important and pressing, like your child\u2019s health.", "Brother is OP's family first. If things are bad from the separation, it makes total sense for the ex to not have a continued familial relationship.\n\nMany, many divorced families have no contact between in-laws (even if just temporarily during the separation). \n\nIf BIL is agreeing that OP should've called, he knew that his call probably wasn't the most appropriate avenue of getting the Ex's attention. \n\nAnd after it all, its still OP's job to communicate for her and their child; not her brother's responsibility. The Ex shares the child with *OP*."]}
