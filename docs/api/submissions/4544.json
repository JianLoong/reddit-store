Since you don't mention why you broke up, unless he's an abuser or something he should always be notified of these things. At the very least, he could try to use it as leverage in court to prove you're an unfit parent if you fail to notify him of an emergency with your child.\n\nYTA because your child is more important than any weirdness you feel, and the other parent should always be contacted if there's an emergency.", "_\"I told him to stop speaking to me but he kept bringing it up and my brother sided with him when he got back.\"_\n\nI'm with the ex and brother on this one.

My husband had specific instructions on who to call to get ahold of me. \nSo... good luck on anyone else trying to reach me when I'm at work.", "He was also at work, so its not like hes supposed to answer the phone to begin with. Or if he was in a meeting hes only glancing at it if it light up. OP's name would have sparked more urgency then an unknown number.", "A text would have worked perfectly even if she didn\u2019t want to call. When I need immediate attention from my husband and he can\u2019t answer calls and not reading his texts, I send him the text with all the info and then call quickly and hang up. I don\u2019t end up talking to him and he gets call and text notifications.", "Maybe his phone was on Do Not Disturb and he only has a few select that he can receive texts and calls from when he\u2019s busy", "No. The father's first reaction should have been \"How's the daughter doing?\". Not, \"YOU SHOULD HAVE CALLED ME INSTEAD OF YOUR BRO!!!\".  \n\nThe priority of your visit to the hospital is the injured daughter, not to berate the other parent. Also, don't make a scene in front or within earshot of a stressed, injured child.", "Why not leave a message then? I know if I'd kept getting called over and over again I'm more likely to think it's spam than an emergency, all it would take is one voice message or text to clear that up.", "Complete fn rubbish! There is absolutely no reason OP needs to make the call personally in this situation. She wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t make the call and very reasonably delegated the task to someone else. \n\nThat the baby daddy here is screening/blocking calls is not OPs problem or responsibility to overcome. People keep bringing up hypothetical situations here because they very effectively illustrate why this guy blocking/screening calls on a number where people may contact him in emergencies is fn asinine! He cannot reasonably expect ALL emergency calls to come from pre-approved sources and all the people here defending his side in this situation are acting just as foolish as him.", ">I have my phone on DND when sleeping or working on important projects\n\nYou're perfectly within your rights for YOU to put YOUR SETTING on your phone, but at the very same time YOU are fully responsible for any calls not getting through and the consequences that result. Nobody else is responsible for YOUR settings for filtering out calls. \n\nAnd yes, that includes when work or any other party requires you to have it - you are still yourself making that conscious choice to allow and implement the filter on your own phone. Anyone like /u/ASleepandAForgetting trying to argue there are good reasons for the filter or block is just missing the point that the responsibility still lies with you.", "Then leave a voicemail, send a text. If calling a person 10 times doesn't work, calling him 10 more isn't likely to work.", "That\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t get to complain when emergency calls don\u2019t get through to you though.", "If you have loved ones and you would want to be there for them in an emergency, though, this is fucked up. \n\nWhen I got in a car crash, the call to my parents didn't come from my number. It came from some cop's work phone at the scene. When my sibling got injured on a field trip, they didn't even have a cell phone at that age. It was a call from some other parent who was chaperoning. If you set up your phone so most calls don't go through, sorry, you should expect that you are going to miss important calls at some point. And we don't even know that this guy _did_ set up a pass-by.", "So if someone's job has a rule that they cannot have their phone on, you suggest....? Breaking that rule? Finding another job?\n\nI know reddit is out of touch with reality, but this is ridiculous.", "I don't know what's got you so upset but I never said ex wasn't responsible for his settings. I'm saying both OP and ex did not have a plan in place for how to contact each other during emergencies. From OPs post, it seems like she knew ex will pick up her calls but not someone else's and NEITHER of them thought 'shit, what happens if someone else needs to contact one of us?'. There are work arounds to not being able to reach someone on their cell phone. \n\nThinking \"OMG YTA because you don't choose to get fired because the ONLY way people can reach you is via cell phone\" is narrow minded.", "Or just wait until he checks his phone.", "\u2026she did give him her phone.", "You do if the person who is on the emergency list, and has the ability to call or text you, doesn\u2019t call or text you about the emergency.", "Also what if both the mom and daughter had been hurt and it was the brother calling to inform him? Seems a bit ridiculous to me but I don't have kids.", "Or what if mom and child were in an accident. No way mom could call when she is incapacitated. Yeah 20 calls is outrageous. Ex is the ah.", "I dont recognize the number calling me. I don't answer. I also don't remeber if that random number was calling me previously. Additionally, I have had a shit ton of spam calls recently.  I may listen to a voice-mail if left when I had time... maybe. In 2 weeks.", "He fucked up having a kid with this woman who managed to make her injured child all about her. Obviously, there\u2019s more to every story, but the brother would push to reach out to the ex if he was a monster.", "No, it's acknowledging (and apparently even just realizing) that the full responsibility of that action still falls entirely on you. \n\nFor you to believe the only possible way forward is to break the rule or find another job is pretty ridiculous itself. Nevertheless, the point is if you accept that job (and it's very possible I could have fallen into that situation) and turn off your phone, YOU would be ridiculous *to blame others* for not being able to reach you. \n\nYou trying to give good, legitimate reasons to have your phone off or blocking calls is a completely separate issue from being an AH for telling another person off for their own actions (like OP's ex did to her). Having a great reason for why you did something that resulted in negative consequences most definitely does NOT absolve you of those consequences.", "That assumes that they know/care about how your emergency list is set up. Ultimately the ability to receive important calls is your own responsibility.", ">YOU would be ridiculous   \n>  \n>to blame others  \n>  \n> for not being able to reach you\n\nOP got told off because she made a CHOICE (you seem big about choices and actions) to not use her own phone (the logical route) and to have her brother call instead.\n\nShe deserved to be told off for that decision, and I suspect there are particular reasons she took that action even though she had no good reason to.", "As said in this post, OP knew he only answered certain numbers while working. So, this is a situation where OP knew the deal but just refused to use her phone.", "And telling the father of the child isn't important? Because to be clear that is why OP didn't call. Because she didn't want to speak to him. \n\nBesides, saying they have to care about your emergency list is such a big deflection of responsibility imo. Never once in an emergency situation have I gone \"Yeah, I can't reach them. Oh well,\" and never once has someone **who has a closer relationship to the person I'm trying to contact** gone \"Well I'm not gonna try and call bc I don't want to talk to him.\" Like nobody is asking you to have a 45 min conversation -- you're being asked to update him about an emergency.", "It says he only answers specific calls while working. That doesn\u2019t mean she knows he has an emergency list filtering out calls. OP likely assumed he\u2019d make an exception for someone calling 20 times.", "That\u2019s not what happened though. They kept trying until they reached him. They didn\u2019t go \u201coh well\u201d and leave it. They tried continuously until they got him. \n\nAnd again, it sounds to me like OP has a good reason to not want to talk to him, and that\u2019s just based off this short post. You have no idea if he has been abusive to her in the past, or if she has trauma around him that would make caring for her daughter difficult after talking to him. \n\nAgain - being able to receive emergency calls as a parent is 100% your own responsibility. It is no one else\u2019s job to keep your filtered emergency list in mind. Expecting otherwise is the height of entitlement. \n\nWhat if OP and daughter had been in an accident together? I guess her ex would never know since he wouldn\u2019t be able to get the call."]}
