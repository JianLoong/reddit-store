What I don't agree with is asking the brother to call in the first place. They are both parents so they should be able to act as adults. This includes calling a guy to inform him that his child is injured even if it might be awkward. She knew about Ex not picking up the phone during work. While she couldn't have known that being called 20 + times wouldn't lead to him picking up, she did know that Ex would be informed more quickly if she had called him.

Did he leave a message? Hey, exbil, need you to call back asap. Or text the same. Hate to say it, but you will be dealing with the ex for a long time. It\u2019s mom\u2019s responsibility to coparent now.", "Yes.  Both.  And grandchildren.  And we have had accidents.  You have more than one plan.  For example, when there is an emergency my kids, have me as one of their ICE and have both my cell and work number.  My daughter had an accident in high school and they called both.  Calling the school office allowed someone to immediately be sent to my room to get me and take my class, where calling my cell phone would not.  \n\nThat works for us.  Everyone needs to figure out what will work in their situation.  This didn\u2019t work.  Obviously.  No one said he could only be reached by a single number.  They only tried two.  And, in point of fact, she was perfectly able to call him.  She didn\u2019t.  This wasn\u2019t a question of WIBTA if I got in an accident and couldn\u2019t call my ex.  This was a question of AITA because I couldn\u2019t be bothered to call my ex because I am putting my feelings about the divorce over my responsibilities as a parent.\n\nAt least now they know that they need to set up a system.  It sucks that most people wait until an emergency to figure that out.  I really think that having cell phones their whole lives has given people a false sense of always being able to contact someone with them.  It\u2019s just not so.", "Hospitals near me make you step outside to make calls. Op made the choice to stay with her injured child. Unless the Ex is a better doctor than the hospital has on staff, op made the choice that was best for the child.", "Then he has no one to blame but himself.

Being at work doesn't matter.", "A simple text message from the OP would also work. I don\u2019t call my childs father everything is done through text messages.

If their employer has a solid, bulletproof way of getting messages to employees, then that's okay.

Leaving a message?  Texting?", "so many jobs don't allow people to use their phones. they could have called his work, since they knew he was there and that was why he wasn't answering.", ">You shouldn't be taking jobs that have these kinds of restrictions.\n\nthis is a very out of touch thing to say. he could likely have been reached if they called his workplace, no? they just didn't.", "> this is a very out of touch thing to say.\n\nOkay. I just know any job that is professional with this rule will have something in place to get messages to folks. And any job that's not professional will be a retail or service work job - and those are literally a dime a dozen right now.\n\nYeah, the OP is an AH, but the other parent didn't help the situation, and if it were a cop or the hospital calling...", "a cop or a hospital probably would have clued in and called his workplace after he didn't answer the first time."]}
