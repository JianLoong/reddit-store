She once made fun of the fact that I get most of my groceries from the local big box super center and not somewhere with more \"high quality product\").\n\n  \nBut I love John and it mattered a lot to him, so I agreed.\n\n  \nOnto the issue: on the final night of my bachelorette party, we decided to have one \"big\" meal that was really pricey and fancy that we all saved up for. Sarah said she had to take an emergency work meeting and for us to go ahead first (the restaurant was walkable from our hotel).\n\n  \nGuys, when Sarah showed up, I was FLOORED. She came in a white sparkly sequin number with a tulle skirt and a tiara. When we were planning the trip, my MOH made it abundantly clear that everyone was supposed to wear pink so we could get a really cute photo together at the restaurant.  \nI'm not even kidding, her outfit was so bridal looking the waitress actually asked if we were having a joint bachelorette party. I was so upset, that when it came time to take photos I absolutely refused to have Sarah in them.\n\n  \nShe said it wasn't her fault because she \"didn't get the memo\", but I told her it was common sense to not wear a bridal looking dress to a bachelorette party if you're not the bride!Plus, she was in the group chat and even made comments about another girl's outfit when we were talking about what we wanted to wear, so I know she knew!\n\n  \nAll of my friends were on my side and they made sure she didn't end up in the photos. When we got home, she pitched a fit to my brother saying that we bullied her at my party and deliberately left her out. She was also pissed because a lot of family and friends noticed she wasn't in the photos and I wasn't afraid to tell them exactly why.\n\n  \nMy brother's really upset though because she's been crying and whining about it nonstop since. Apparently they're both so mad that they're going to skip father's day brunch, so the whole thing is blowing up even more.\n\n  \nI'm starting to feel bad because my mom told me that my brother and Sarah were fighting a lot now, so I'm not sure if I'm being the AH here. My brother called me a bridezilla, but I really feel like Sarah was trying to ruin my night.", "created_utc": 1686895502, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14aoqg1/aita_for_not_including_my_sil_in_photos_during_my/", "score": 21541, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's a social norm to not wear white, so its kind of an asshole move to exclude someone completely but like, I get it. Now a fucking tiara, my god.", ">A TIARA and a TULLE SKIRT\n\nI looked up what a tulle skirt looks like. No way in the 9 circles of hell did she not realize she was upstaging you. Add to the fact that she supposedly had a work meeting, meaning she should not have had the time to put that on unless well planned in advance. She also was commenting on the outfits of the other women in the group chat, and she did not notice the tendency towards pink? Also, who wears a tiara if not for very special occasions  (in which the person wearing it is the subject of the celebration)?\n\nI have read in the comments that you should not invite her to the wedding. Seeing the reaction of your brother, this would definitely hurt your relationship. Is your brother aware of what she wore? Did you take a picture of her outfit? Because if he knows and values her more than what she did, you are going to have issues with your brother in the future no matter what. So keep that in mind.\n\nThis is what I would do. First, zero apologies. Make sure your brother understands the nature of her outfit and why it was improper. Second, extend a conditional invite, making sure they both understand that if she tries such a stunt on your wedding day she will not be allowed to enter. Make it clear this does not mean you are controlling what she wears, this means she has to respect the norms of pretty much the entire world, where you are not supposed to look like the damn bride. It is that simple. She can look good without looking like backup bride.\n\nRegardless of your choice, your (more than likely future) SIL will be out for you regardless. In the wedding, she will try to upstage you. She apparently does think herself better than you already, and your brother condones it to some degree. So be mindful of that, do not let your emotions get the better of you, and do not be afraid of the verbal riposte (comeback) to anything. A no nonsense attitude leads to respect. A \"let it slide for the sake of peace\" never leads to peace and respect. Set clear boundaries and above all, keep calm. People will notice who throws the hissy fits and will make their own judgment.\n\nNTA op.\n\nEdit: I just remembered. Your brother may try to propose during your wedding. Actually, given his reaction to how she reacted, I think that was his plan so far. Ask him privately if he was thinking of it. Judging by her character, she is capable of trying to make your wedding day all about her future happiness, even throwing remarks how her wedding will be even better, and if you make any comments, she will say it is jealousy. **Do not let him propose during your wedding day. If necessary, have a couple of men be on the lookout for any intervention.**", "Idk, I think if OP loves her brother very much, OP should call her up to everything she can, and warn her brother.\n\nIf this resulted in fights, it means OP's brother has some common sense. Maybe it's time she helped him realize what kind of woman he is thinking of marrying. If that means an *expected* problem happening during the wedding, so be it. \n\nFar be it from you to dictate who your brother should marry OP,  but you could give her the opportunity to dig her own grave and be gone from your family once and for all. Or... Nothing could happen and there would still be less family drama than you uninviting them. Your brother could be very offended by all this.", "NTA! I would\u2019ve been PISSED!! She clearly sent everyone ahead so she could pull this off because if you\u2019d seen it before you all started walking to the restaurant, you would\u2019ve made her change into ANYTHING ELSE. \n\nThe fact that she and your brother are now fighting tells me that maybe you helped him dodge a bullet. He won\u2019t see that now but someday he might thank you for this so he could see her true colors. \n\nAlso, no bridesmaid for her and maybe she doesn\u2019t get to come to the wedding at all.
