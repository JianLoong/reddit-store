She 100% knew if she got ready the same time as them, they wouldn't let her come. This was premeditated.", "Agreed, I can't see her not starting problems.

They're such sweethearts and I hope that the pregnancy goes safely. :(", "I doubt it's anything to do with common sense, the people who pull this crap know full well that they're not supposed to do it, but they do it anyway because to them attention is attention, good or bad, and when they get bad attention they get the added bonus (to them) of getting to play the victim even though they know that they're 100% in the wrong.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "It\u2019s neither: it\u2019s plan seltzer and chocolate syrup (U-Bet brand, if you can find it outside of NYC).", "It\u2019s the Catalina Wine-Mixer!!!", "[removed]", "[removed]"]}
