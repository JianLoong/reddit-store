I wasn't happy (she's quite snobbish, almost in a comically villainous way. She once made fun of the fact that I get most of my groceries from the local big box super center and not somewhere with more \"high quality product\").\n\n  \nBut I love John and it mattered a lot to him, so I agreed.\n\n  \nOnto the issue: on the final night of my bachelorette party, we decided to have one \"big\" meal that was really pricey and fancy that we all saved up for. Sarah said she had to take an emergency work meeting and for us to go ahead first (the restaurant was walkable from our hotel).\n\n  \nGuys, when Sarah showed up, I was FLOORED. She came in a white sparkly sequin number with a tulle skirt and a tiara. When we were planning the trip, my MOH made it abundantly clear that everyone was supposed to wear pink so we could get a really cute photo together at the restaurant.  \nI'm not even kidding, her outfit was so bridal looking the waitress actually asked if we were having a joint bachelorette party. I was so upset, that when it came time to take photos I absolutely refused to have Sarah in them.\n\n  \nShe said it wasn't her fault because she \"didn't get the memo\", but I told her it was common sense to not wear a bridal looking dress to a bachelorette party if you're not the bride!Plus, she was in the group chat and even made comments about another girl's outfit when we were talking about what we wanted to wear, so I know she knew!\n\n  \nAll of my friends were on my side and they made sure she didn't end up in the photos. When we got home, she pitched a fit to my brother saying that we bullied her at my party and deliberately left her out. She was also pissed because a lot of family and friends noticed she wasn't in the photos and I wasn't afraid to tell them exactly why.\n\n  \nMy brother's really upset though because she's been crying and whining about it nonstop since. Apparently they're both so mad that they're going to skip father's day brunch, so the whole thing is blowing up even more.\n\n  \nI'm starting to feel bad because my mom told me that my brother and Sarah were fighting a lot now, so I'm not sure if I'm being the AH here. My brother called me a bridezilla, but I really feel like Sarah was trying to ruin my night.", "created_utc": 1686895502, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14aoqg1/aita_for_not_including_my_sil_in_photos_during_my/", "score": 811, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So what led up to that decision, and what was she expecting going in? I'd love to be inside that head for just a little while, that kind of crazy is baffeling. \n\nBest of luck with your day!

You are NTA", "I have a bit of a petty streak, well maybe not a bit maybe a lot.\n\nI would have absolutely included her in any photos I would have control over, and then I would photoshop her white dress into an unflattering colour.

Gaslighting is a chaotic evil action, and I embrace my alignment with open arms. >:)", "NTA if it was another colour like blue or purple or whatever I am sure it wouldn't have been a big deal.

I had a specific bridesmaid dress I wanted everyone to wear. I even picked out the cheap ones ($50 price range) she could afford it. Everyone wored what was required BUT her. Tried to say she couldn't afford it. I told her in the beginning to let me know and I can buy it like I did for my now husband's sister, I knew they couldn't afford it so I made sure she had one. I didn't care for the color. I knew target didn't have white ones, but the colors they had was perfect for my theme so it didn't matter what she chose!\n\nShe always had to be the center of attention. She was picking at my engagement ring the whole time leading up to the wedding. Talking about why did he go cheap when he could've gotten a ring like what she wants, which was close to 2k. I'm not a materialistic girl, I picked out my ring. I had my husband buy a ring that was less than $1 because I knew I would lose it (news flash, I did. I went through 5 rings in 10 years HAHA) but I knew what I liked, what I knew would happen. No matter how much I tried to prevent things from happening with the rings, it still did. I can't even find my band anymore and I did spend $50 on that. My dress itself, with alterations was $200. She kept picking at everything because I made sure my wedding wouldn't be expensive. I was able to get everything done under $400. \n\nI'm kinda glad she's out of the picture family wise, but as a friend, she was a ride or die gal, I miss that part of her", "NTA.

Please, you need to speak to your brother without her there.

It's not his girlfriend's place to take that away from him. \n\nThe first missed event is the hardest.
