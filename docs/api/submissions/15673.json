It\u2019s totally fine to not want your daughter to listen to rap but the way you spoke to your niece is inappropriate.

If they both already knew the dance and all the words, it's likely they both already knew about the song.

You are an adult who confronted a 14 year old girl as if she was also an adult and accused her of trying to brainwash your daughter.  You also threatened her with your family no longer attending family events.  Do you think any of that was appropriate to direct at a 14 year.

I\u2019m seriously doubtful that your niece fully grasps what \u201cwhite powder\u201d the song is referring to. Often, we\u2019re exposed to content before we are mature enough to fully grasp it. In the future you could always take the opportunity to start a conversation about their perception of the song. \u201cWhat do you think this song is about?\u201d, etc. You might find that both girls have no real idea what the lyrics mean and just like the song. \n\nThere are so many popular songs, old and new, with questionable content. Look at the Rolling Stone\u2019s \u201cBrown Sugar\u201d, for example. Generationally popular and catchy. You and I hear that and immediately understand it\u2019s a song about fetishizing a black woman. Your daughter/niece hear that and may well believe it\u2019s just a song about brown sugar, the food. \n\nTake these opportunities as teaching moments rather than times to yell at children about topics they may very well not understand at all. It encourages real conversation when, inevitably, your child is exposed to actual drugs, etc.", "You seem to have gone zero to 60 in 0.7 seconds.\n\nYou're the 54 year old adult, and your neice is a 14 year old.

I understand your concern, I also would not want my 13yo singing lyrics about cocaine. I promise your 14 yo niece didn\u2019t corrupt your 13yo daughter. Drugs are an adult conversation, so maturity around it will also send the message it\u2019s not something to joke about.

Are you telling me you knew the meaning of every song you sang along to at 13 and then went out and did all they things?

First, did you even know what it was about and second, if you did, did you run out and \u201cget physical\u201d? You should have more confidence in yourself as a parent that you\u2019re talking to your kids about drugs and other subjects. I grew up in a highly conservative religion, I promise, not talking about these things and pretending like kids don\u2019t get exposed just makes it so much more appealing.", "YTA. I understand your reasons, but it's unlikely you will be able to shelter your daughter from this kind of music entirely. Rather, you should have a frank discussion with your daughter about the subject matter of the song and that it's not necessary to use drugs to have fun.

She is essentially playing the shortened internet version of playing one song on Dance Dance Revolution until it's mastered. \n\nTo second what someone else said, you can sing a song and dance to it without living the life. Also I'll be honest your niece probably only has half an idea, if any, what the song is about. I worked with 10-13 year olds once upon a time for 6 years and sometimes the stuff kids say, repeat or do without knowing what they are actually saying or doing is...frequent to say the least and they are usually mortified when someone CALMLY points out to them how inappropriate the thing they are doing or saying is. You could've calmly explained that you did not approve of the song and that they needed to find something more appropriate to dance to.\n\nAll in all, your niece just wanted to do a cool dance with your daughter to have fun and you acted like a pyschopath.

IF you competently raised your daughter to understand the dangers/harm of drugs, no amount of hours spent listening to \"Dr. Feelgood\" is going to change that. In fact, there's a decent chance that neither of the girls even knew that the lyrics were about drugs in the first place, until you flipped your lid.
