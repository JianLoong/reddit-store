Revealing and modest are subjective here, the problem is that the bride asked her not to do something and she did it anyway.

She could've easily picked three or four styles to give bridesmaids some direction. We talking Hollywood Xtian modest, IBLP/FDLS Prarie dress, Bible Belt 1950's misogyny or Modern Muslim. That alone makes OP the AH. \n\nYTA", "God forbid the bride be easygoing and assume the people in her wedding party wouldn\u2019t do things to purposefully upset her at her wedding.", "If she knew the bride well enough to be a bridesmaid, she knew the bride well enough to know about the religious family and upbringing. Any even remotely rational person would have run the dress by the bride.", "Did you miss the part where she asked to and friend said it wasn't ready because it was being custom made.", "I mean. If they\u2019ve been friends for a while I think she knows what \u201cdressing modestly\u201d looks like to op,,,because that\u2019s how she dresses\u2026", "I highly doubt that in current times. There's this great mechanism that's they've used in legal standards for a long time that works for this. It's called a \"reasonable person\" standard it applies to almost any situations like this. You can assume a person to be a reasonable person and make your judgment based on that.", "Whether or not it's her personal standard usually, it's the standard she dictated for her wedding. You don't ignore the bride because you don't like why she made a decision.", "OP asked her maid of honor to address the situation, because she didn't approve of it", "I agree this is so vague. There are tight styles and very tight dresses that show everything off. Revealing could mean anything. Tight enough to see a whole silhouette, boobs, low cut, high slit in the bottom, short, backless, see through, no mid section, all of the above. It\u2019s really hard to get a judgement with two vague descriptions. I wanna see the dress", "Good point-if she was getting a custom dress she could have a specific style or a certain body type that\u2019s hard to shop for. I think there\u2019s a fine between expressing yourself and picking a dress you\u2019re comfortable in because you can\u2019t force a bridesmaid to wear something they\u2019re uncomfortable in-and dressing appropriately to stand in front of their whole family and being in their photos for the rest of their lives. This post is too vague to make a clear judgement. Especially if the bridesmaid just has big boobs or something.", "OP set the guidelines for OP's wedding. It's not the place of her bridesmaid to decide that OP's instructions can be ignored because she disagrees with who OP listens to. OP says it was tight and revealing. It's clear at the very least that her understanding of that is less conservative than MIL. There's no reason to arbitrarily decide she's lying just because we disagree in general with prudish people.", "Very true. There also seems to have been a lack of oversight by OP. Giving free reign with a vague requirement, as \u201cmodest\u201d can vary from person to person, something like this was bound to happen. A more clear description of what OP could have avoided this situation. Should the friend have asked for approval? Most certainly. It just seems like multiple people dropped the ball here.", "Ofcourse OP doesn't have to be glued to their phones to reply to judgemental assholes like me! (honestly no sarcasm intended), it's just that usually in this subreddit you'll see people jumping to be able to defend themselves and quite a few people have asked about the dress.\n\nAnd, yes definitely, there is a time and a place for saucy outfits. There are dressed I'd wear to an evening out with my bf, that I wouldn't wear to the office. But there are also other women in my office walking around in very short skirts and high heels, which I don't think is professional.\n\nEveryone's opinion on 'revealing' is different.\n\nI love your example of \"free skin\" and agree with it, there is a time and a place, but I'm also wondering if maybe the friend didn't actually consider her dress revealing? (Like the women in my office think their dresses are fine) edited to add: and that's why she didn't ask? Because she didn't realize her dress would be considered revealing.", "Yeah, OP needs to link a similar dress for us to really know", "me too\u2026 i hope OP does post this dress so we can rlly see if it\u2019s actuallt bad enough to have her thrown out over", "The post literally says the reason a picture wasn't shown was that the dress was still being made.", "There\u2019s no way there wasn\u2019t a sketch to send her. And any rational person would have gotten the bride\u2019s buy-in, whether she asked for it or not, before having a dress custom made. Anyone who would make a custom dress would want a sketch agreed on, likely with the customer\u2019s signature, so there was no misunderstanding what the end result would be. \n\nThis was either deliberate or Ava is the most self-centered, clueless person on the face of the earth. She knew the dress was supposed to be modest and she knew why. She wanted to make a statement. Someone else\u2019s wedding is not the time or place for that.", "Those same ppl didn\u2019t have a problem with Melania\u2019s bare arms. Their outrage was not about a dress\u2026", "EXACTLY! And yes, I'll never forget the hideous responses to Mrs. Obama wearing a sleeveless dress. (Or one of Obama's biggest scandals, the tan suit.)\n\nAnd, thank you, that's exactly what I'm saying. Some sort of approval beforehand could have prevented all of this. And if you're giving vague phrases like \"modest\" when you have family that is apparently extremely hard-to-please, you're just asking to create a problem.\n\nSo many people are calling Ava some spotlight-stealing hussy, but unless OP says she wore a leather miniskirt and leather crop top two sizes too small, I don't see how anyone is comfortable judging the bridesmaid so viciously off of the very limited information being given to us.", "It doesn\u2019t, really. \u201cEveryone else was sharing pics and she was suspiciously silent\u201d would have conveyed that. \u201cI asked her about the dress design a few times but she was vague and never sent pics\u201d would have conveyed that. \u201cShe never showed me a picture as it was still getting made\u201d just means the dress wasn\u2019t ready in time for OP to see a picture and OP apparently did not ask for a description.", "That\u2019s not the implication I got, really.", ">purposefully upset her at her wedding.\n\nNo one would have a problem labeling the bridesmaid the asshole if that was what actually happened. But we have no clue if those were her intentions.", "She didn't say that she asked to.", "I feel like that could be intentional on the bridesmaids part though. Because wouldn\u2019t she have given the seamstress inspiration photos? And she would\u2019ve likely had at least one fitting which likely would\u2019ve given the seamstress enough time to make adjustments", "It seems like OP has not always followed the modesty rules, but is especially respectful of them around family to avoid arguments. If this friend hasn\u2019t really seen OP interact with her family, they might not know how strict it is with OP\u2019s family. \n\nAlso, there is still a LOT of variety in what people consider modest. For some it\u2019s no shoulders, for some it\u2019s clothing to the knees and elbows, for some it\u2019s wrists and ankle, for some it also covers how tight clothing is in certain areas, for some it\u2019s no pants, etc. Just a blanket \u201cmodest\u201d dress could honestly mean a lot of things.", "> You can assume a person to be a reasonable person and make your judgment based on that.\n\nReasonable people don't use feminist as if it's an insult, so I won't be giving OP that benefit of the doubt just yet.", "Actually, it may be a subtle difference, but OP said the MOH offered to handle it and then kicked her out.\n\nI honestly don't know if OP intended to have her kicked out or not.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking? Also seen modest dresses that are form fitting, modest dresses with spaghetti straps, etc\u2026 and maybe shoulders are taboo? \n\nBottom line is the bride should have asked to see sketches of the dress when told it was being custom made at the very least.", ">This post is too vague to make a clear judgement.\n\nTHANK YOU!\n\nPeople are getting so annoyed with my post but there's a reason I didn't give an actual judgment. I don't think OP handled the situation wisely, that's for sure. But I would have no problem labeling the bridesmaid an asshole if she was deliberately trying to create a scene. But I have no evidence that she had bad intentions and I would need to know her intentions to give a fair judgment here.\n\nPlus, form-fitting is sort of the standard for most bridesmaids dresses that I've seen. And, like you said, form-fitting is also unavoidable for certain body types. I don't care if you have an hourglass shape, an apple shape, a pear shape, or a beach ball shape, chances are most dresses are going to be tight on some part of your body.\n\nWe need more information.", ">OP set the guidelines for OP's wedding\n\n\"Modest\" is far too vague to be a proper guideline.\n\nI never accused anyone of lying.", "That\u2019s fair, but I\u2019d say the responsibility split there is like 80/15/5 between Ava, MOH, and OP. \n\nThe bride has enough stuff to worry about. If she said modest and multiple people immediately knew her dress was a problem upon arrival then Ava did not do her due diligence when deciding on her dress. I mean I\u2019m assuming to warrant that severe of a reaction she must\u2019ve way off base lol. Our definitions of \u201cmodest\u201d don\u2019t vary THAT much", "I\u2019m 50% sure Ava did not consider her dress revealing, but again, if you are asked something, you make sure your choice is ok by sending the picture :D another example: \u201cplease don\u2019t wear white at my wedding\u201d and the maid is dressed in ivory or super pale grey or super pale light blue. They may not be canonic white but come on, really? I don\u2019t find any excuse for Ava\u2019s behavior just because we all have a smartphone or a computer\n\n\nTLDR: you are asked something -> send a picture to see if it\u2019s ok. You are not asked anything -> go dressed as Xena if you feel comfortable", "You have at least a try on on custom made dress, especially if this dress \u201cis a way to express myself\u201d. So the excuse is kind of weak", "Which was a bald ass lie. No seamstress is going to make a custom dress with agreeing on a sketch first. They would more than likely have Ava sign the agreed upon sketch. Would should have been sent to the bride before Ava proceeded. Then there would have been fittings galore. At any of which, Ava could have snapped a photo and sent it to the bride. \n\nEven if she ordered a \u201ccustom\u201c dress online from eShakti or something like that and it wasn\u2019t truly custom, there would have been a photo that she could have shown the bride. This was a very deliberate move, which is obvious because Ava didn\u2019t try to claim the dress was modest or apologize for missing the mark. She said she was \u201cexpressing herself.\u201d She knew exactly what she was doing.", "Let's be clear, they didn't have a problem with Melania's NUDES and the fact that the then-FLOTUS was formerly a pr0n star. It's about the racism.", ">Melania\u2019s bare arms\n\nLet's be fair. Those same people were completely fine Melania's nudes in that trashy magazine. And, let's be honest, we're not talking artistically done nudes either. They also had no moral issues with the serial-cheater Trump.\n\nThe same way it wasn't about the tan suit. After all, conservatives never took up issue with Reagan's tan suit.", "Wait, sleeveless dresses are immodest? I wonder how many people have thought I'm sleazy because I'm wearing a perfectly nice dress that doesn't have sleeves.", "Why even put the line about the picture at all then? If she didn't ask every bridesmaid to send a picture why only one was supposed to send it?", "Specifically saying she didn't send a picture gives you the reasonable assumption that everyone else DID send a picture of theirs.  It's not hard to apply a reasonable standard to things like this and see the small things between the lines. Use your brain to do some basic deductive reasoning. That really is not too much to ask.", "OP didn't use it as an insult,  I see I found the unreasonable person", "That's fair", "Exactly my thought! No way the seamstress didn\u2019t have a reference photo so hiding it makes it seem sketchy.", "And it\u2019s hard to say too because everyone\u2019s idea of \u201ctoo revealing\u201d is so different based on their background. I know a lot of girls who just have big boobs and it can be easy to look revealing while they literally just bought a dress. I wasn\u2019t gifted in that sense lol but I have a larger butt and if I wear a tight style dress or a high slit in the back it can become revealing really fast while someone else might be perfectly modest in it. And if she\u2019s judging based on body type I think that\u2019s very different, and I think that might be the case because body types can be hard to shop for which could be why they went custom", "Ok. Maybe that's literally all she said. Regardless it IS about OP and what OP is ok with for her wedding. It is OP's wedding. Once OP set the terms, the MIL is irrelevant as far as the bridesmaid's dresses are concerned. The bride decides. If the bridesmaid doesn't agree, she bows out.", "She definitely considered it revealing. Her response wouldn't be \"this is my way of expressing myself\" if she didn't, she would've said \"what about this dress is considered immodest to your family\" or something maybe more angry along those lines.", ">Wait, sleeveless dresses are immodest?\n\nSomeone in the comments mentioned the Michelle Obama scandal as a good example most of us still remember. She was torn apart by conservative media for wearing a lovely, perfectly appropriate, sleeveless dress.\n\nAnd that's sort of the point about how meaningless a term like \"modest\" is. Modest to some means the nipples are covered, while to others it means there better not be a hint of ankles or, God forbid, bare arms!", "\"Modesty\" is rarely about the actual garment worn, but is usually just an excuse to put someone down. If something is \"sleazy\" or not is usually just determined by whether someone is looking for an excuse to attack you. And if your outfit isn't sleazy, it is probably stuffy!\n\nOutside of that, for many conservative Christians, showing your shoulders is always immodest. Where I grew up, the way people talked about spaghetti strap tops, you might as well be wearing only lingerie.", "OP never said Ava \u201cwas supposed to send\u201d anything; she just said she didn\u2019t. Like, \u201cI had no idea what the dress was going to look like beforehand,\u201d so people don\u2019t think she approved or chose the dress herself (which is common for bridesmaid dresses) and then got mad about it.", "To explain how it came to be that she didnt see it. She may or may not have seen others, not enough info to say.", "It only means that she didn't see it prior, and why. She may or may not have asked but she stressed how hands-off she was otherwise."]}
