You are adhering to what your extended family considers modest which could be anything from no cleavage and nothing above the knee to fully covered no skin showing.

When requiring a certain standard, you should have picked the dresses or certain styles that could be chosen from. \nYour MOH went a bit too far kicking her out.

Then OP seems like a bit of an asshole for not playing a bigger role in dress choices. Let's be honest, everyone's idea of modest is going to be slightly different.\n\nAlso, the feminist comment really rubs me the wrong way and reminds me of people who use terms like \"traditional\" and \"old fashioned\" as codes for raging misogyny and blatant racism/homophobia.

It is no different than wearing white to a wedding or bringing a kid to a childless wedding.  When the bride says don't  do it and she did it anyway then the bride had every right to say, nope, nope and done.
