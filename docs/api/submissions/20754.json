I asked my friend from university Ava 26f to be a bridesmaid. I grew up living with my parents and extended family quite religiously and dressed modestly as my family were very strict and traditional. While I don't agree with most of their ideas, I do follow them to avoid arguments. My parents don't share the same ideas and are less religious and have always supported me, but do ask me to respect our extended family's policies on dressing and culture.\n\nAva is a very passionate feminist and I know she wouldn't agree with some of my family's policies, which is why before the wedding I told her to please not say anything at the wedding and if it upsets her she can always stay closer to our group of friends. She agreed and said she was coming to support me.\n\nI picked peach as a dress colour for all my bridesmaids and told them to pick the style they felt comfortable in, as I didn't specify a particular dress or shade of peach and gave them all 4 months notice. I only asked for the dress to be modest as my wedding would include some of my extended family. Ava said she was getting her dress custom made and never showed me a picture as it was still getting made.  At the wedding, she comes in wearing a very tight, revealing peach dress. My MOH said she would handle it and kicked her out. Ava has said that the dress was her way of expressing herself. She is not talking to me anymore, but I genuinely don't think I am in the wrong.\n\neta- I called Ava's dress revealing as she had a tight sleeveless minidress on. I also wear tight clothing myself similar to she wore, but I don't think that is wedding appropriate, especially as I requested at my wedding for the sake of my extended family that we wear modest clothing.

On the other hand, if someone brings a conversationally polite guest who uses the wrong fork to eat their salad one person might still think that guest was \u201cwell-mannered\u201d and another person might say that guest was lacking manners/ uncouth. This is even more convoluted because the reason she is saying it is important is for family, not herself. So if someone says a guest needs to be well-mannered and their friends have seen them eat with elbows on the table, their friends will probably think that it\u2019s okay if the guest uses the entree fork with the salad as long as they don\u2019t chew with their mouth open.\n\nSaying \u201cmodest\u201d or \u201ctasteful\u201d without explicitly defining those terms is a problem. The only way the bridesmaid was in the wrong is if she wore something no one could possibly classify as modest. \n\nIf OP says her bridesmaid wore a sheer strapless bandaid minidress with no bra and 6inch lucite heels then it\u2019s absolutely and almost universally understood that the outfit was not modest. If, on the other hand, she wore a tea length form fitting number with cap sleeves and a slightly scooped neck but has a larger chest then the bride is an asshole for using a subjective term when what she wanted was beyond what most people would think of as \u201cmodest.\u201d\n\nShe herself says these are families standards, not her own, so if the bridesmaid wore something similar to outfits the bride has worn in the past or hasn\u2019t been around the family members who OP is trying to appease then the bridesmaid could have very reasonably worn something she thought was modest that the bride did not. In which case, the bride is absolutely the asshole. \n\nIt\u2019s on the bride to clarify what modest means and, if she has a specific restrictive definition, check outfits. It\u2019s not on her friend to go beyond the most universally accepted definition of the term.\n\nFor some people a dress would be modest if it didn\u2019t have cut outs or a plunging neckline and hit just above the knees.

Since all OP is saying is that it\u2019s \u201ctight\u201d and \u201crevealing\u201d there is simply not enough info to judge. But given what a terrible job she did describing the dress, I\u2019d lean toward her being the asshole.

Any price point, any style, any shade of peach-- just modest is pretty easy-going of her.\n\nAva going with a custom-made very tight and revealing dress was deliberately flaunting / power tripping.

And not all of it is solely due to how Ava reacted or what the dress looks like, either. There is simply too much information left out to make a proper judgment. This is why both N T A and Y T A judgments are getting a decent number of upvotes; people are filling in the gaps and coming up with a judgment based on the filled gaps.\n\nBelow is a non-exhaustive list of points I've thought about in order to properly give a judgment.\n\n* OP says \"Ava said she was getting her dress custom made and never showed [OP] a picture as it was still getting made.\" Custom-made or not, a dress is still a dress, so did OP ask any of the bridesmaids for pictures of their dresses at all?\n\n * A lot of people are making the assumption that because Ava never showed OP any pictures of her dress, that Ava intentionally hid pictures of the dress from OP. But we don't actually know that. It could be malice, yeah. But it could also just be that a custom-made dress isn't going to have pictures throughout the entire process. Or it could just be that OP never asked in the first place, and so Ava would have no reason to volunteer that information out. For instance, I'm not going to tell my coworker what I ate for breakfast if the coworker doesn't specifically ask me. People who assume malice on Ava's part will have given an N T A judgment.\n\n* A wedding is a day that the bride and groom want to make as perfect as possible, with as little room for error as possible. Given this, why wouldn't it have been in OP's best interest to proactively ask for pictures of the dress before the bridesmaids finalized their decisions? OP is definitely at least partially at fault for not properly mitigating this problem.\n\n* What body type does Ava have compared to the other bridesmaids? It could very well be that the dresses themselves look the same when viewed side-by-side and not being worn. But as women should know, dresses look vastly different on people, so what would look acceptable when not on a body may be different when actually worn. That's... kind of the point of why fitting rooms and try-before-you-buy exist.\n\n* Of course, what you've already touched on -- OP says that Ava's dress was \"tight [and] revealing.\"\n\n * Where was the dress revealing (legs, slits, cut-outs, cleavage), and how revealing was it?\n\n * In what way was the dress tight?\n\n* OP says that Ava said \"the dress was her way of expressing herself.\" But there are some questions regarding this statement:\n\n * Is this *actually* what Ava said? Or did OP phrase what Ava said in a way to try and put her in a bad light?\n\n * Is this the *entirety* of what Ava said? Or did OP exclude other parts of what Ava said to try and put her in a bad light?\n\n* We only have one side of the story here. What is Ava's side of this same story?\n\nAnd lastly...\n\n* Usually in AITA posts, the OP will reply to comments that get left in their posts, saying things like \"Yeah I agree,\" or \"Dang I guess I was more of a jerk than I thought.\" But there is none of that here. Importantly, all INFO judgments have been left unanswered, when usually at least some of them would have been answered by now. Which leads to the question: Why isn't OP responding?\n\n * Is it due to OP genuinely not being able to respond in any way (in which case she could've done an edit to say \"Oh I'll be back in the morning\" or something)?\n\n * Is it due to the overwhelming number of responses (in which case she can just do an edit on the original post or reply selectively to a few comments)?\n\n * Is it malice on OP's part, as an \"Here's a situation for you guys to mull on, talk amongst yourselves, I'm out\" sort of deal?\n\n * Is it OP struggling to formulate responses to questions to keep the story consistent, because perhaps her post was embellished to illicit one judgment over the other, but the post garnered more scrutiny than she anticipated, so she doesn't know how to respond to keep a consistent story?\n\n * Or most damning of all, did none of this even happen and this is just a creative writing exercise told as though it were a real story, and we all got caught hook, line, and sinker?\n\n* _(Given OP's account history, I have my suspicions as to what the motive of this AITA post is, but I'm not going to explicitly state that here.)_", "I agree. We also kinda need more of a cultural background to apply the modesty context to. \n\nAre we talking the Cathedral in the UK the Royals got married in, are we talking somewhere about a Christian church in San Francisco?

All you need to know is that both the bride and the MOH agreed it wasn't modest, and Ava herself didn't evince any confusion on the subject, instead leaping directly to the arguments made by defiant bridesmaids who know they're ignoring the rules.\n\nSo from that we know that *the bride, the Maid of Honor,* ***and Ava*** all agreed that the dress was not acceptable.", "Also what bride doesn\u2019t clear it beforehand, ESPECIALLY knowing their friend could have been a \u201cwildcard\u201d persay and especially especially knowing their family is so uptight\u2026.

You know what you do when it\u2019s your friends wedding you error on the side of caution cause they are your friend and it\u2019s their fucking wedding.\n\nYou have be an utter Neanderthal to be given all this context about being modest and then not play it super safe.\n\nIt\u2019s like you telling someone you aren\u2019t very hungry so let\u2019s only order a bit of pizza pizza and then they order an extra large. Sure a little bit is reportage to a lot of people but you have to be a caveman to hear a little bit and order an xl even if your normal order is 2 XL pizzas.\n\nAlso I\u2019d feel terrible if I showed up at my friends wedding and fucked yo there one request of me. I wouldn\u2019t not talk to them anymore and make it all about me.\n\nThis girl throws off every narcissist red flag you can imagine. And if she wasn\u2019t a general asshat than the BOH wouldn\u2019t have kicked her ass to the curb I am sure.", "It doesn\u2019t say it was extremely low cut. We don\u2019t know what \u2018revealing\u2019 means, hence needing to see the dress to make a judgement.", "Let me head you off there:  This isn't just the bride's individual reaction.  The MoH appears to have individually decided that this was unacceptable.  Two points of reference suggests that this friend should have a reason to know what was unacceptable and what was very much not.", "But how did everyone one else in the wedding party get it right and not her?", "I think there\u2019s a general churchy modest that most Americans can picture though. Tight and low cut are not part of that esthetic", "So you are telling me that it isn\u2019t an asshole move not to share your dress with the bride even if they didn\u2019t specifically ask?\n\nI just feel like any sane human being would want to run their outfit by the bride asked or not cause well who wants to be \u201cthat guy\u201d.", "But if Ava thought she was listing to the bride's wishes, she wouldn't have said \"it's my way of expressing myself.\" That implies that she knew exactly what she was doing.", "Note that the excuse of the bridesmaid was not \u201csorry I thought this was modest enough\u201d but \u201cthis is the way I express myself\u201d.\n\nShe knew what she was doing, she wanted to make an statement, she wanted to make it about HER.", "This is my thought. It\u2019s difficult to be modest when curvy since anything tight around curves is automatically booted out of the modesty category. It also takes more to cover a large bust, so it can look revealing in many items.", "The fact that she had to be coached on etiquette beforehand leads me to agree", "She didn't ask for it to be tasteful.\n\nWhat she said:\n\n> I only asked for the dress to be modest", "OP didn't say the dresses should be \"tasteful\" she said they needed to be modest.\n\nIn addition, your comment is the first mention of T&A is in your comment.\n\nAre you in the habit of just making stuff up to get indignant about?\n\nWhy don't you just stick to what is actually in the post?", "I would argue the bride communicated appropriately and the bridesmaid should have made an effort to show her the dress to try to respect her request. Sounds like she either intentionally went rogue or at least did not make an effort to make sure she complied. Either way NTA", "How can she share a photo when she appeared with a dress handmade and was thrown out right after coming to the wedding because it was too revealing ? It's absurd to even think that op would have a photo of it.", "Honestly the bigger issue to me was her inviting \u201ctraditional and strict\u201d family that she supposedly doesn\u2019t agree with. We know what that actually means, if you\u2019ve ever grown up around such people and their religion. Like me. It\u2019s bigots. I know how hard it can be to not bow to them in the name of \u201ckeeping the peace/avoiding drama\u201c but I stopped tolerating their presence because I would not stand there and listen to the vile things they said. I\u2019m much better off now, much happier.\n\nIf there is one nazi at a table with ten other people, there are 11 nazis. How can we change and make things better for marginalized people if we pander to their oppressors?\n\nThis is bigger than the dress issue to me, is what I\u2019m saying. Otherwise this is an e s h to me bc the bride should have just picked a style if she wanted to avoid this. She knew her friend and I think this was a test. Friend should either have not gone or just sucked it up. Bride knew her extended family and what they consider modest. I don\u2019t think friend did. But I\u2019m curious about her other bridesmaids dresses too\u2026", "Bridesmaid used OP's wedding to make a statement. That is an asshole move. Bridesmaid is fully aware of what is considered decent in OP's family and purposely crossed that line. The fact you never heard of something happening, does in fact not mean it does not happen, either.", "When I got married, my sisters were my bridesmaids. I only told them the colour scheme and that I'd like them to wear burgundy. They both sent me pictures of their dresses, shoes and accessories. I was the bride, it was my wedding and they wanted to ok it with me. Ava knew what she was doing. She made it about herself.", "You politely send a picture when there is a very clear request and you are a bridesmaid. In the same way, you send a screenshot of the booking page when you are booking a hotel/airbnb for a holiday with your friends. You send pictures to coordinate your moves with others. You would not send a picture if the bride said \u201chi people, this is the link of the dress I chose for you, everyone pick their size\u201d because everything would be already decided. But when you have free room to \u201cexpress yourself\u201d (read: enjoy and personalize your dress or fk up badly) if you cherish your friendship with the bride you send her what you chose just to have a feedback", "Tasteful was not the standard, so your comments are based on a misreading of the request.\n\n> I only asked for the dress to be modest\n\nModest and tasteful are not the same concepts. \n\nA modestly cut dress in obnoxiously loud colors would not be tasteful.", "The post has been up for 9 hours now and the top five responses are INFO", "For 3 hours?", "Is that more a cultural thing? I've known wedding parties with similar rules to OP's and bridal approval wasn't required or if the bride wanted to approve dresses they said so flat out. \n\nDo people do this if the bride doesn't express they want to approve dresses?", "She said it was custom made for the BM. How is she supposed to show it? She didn't take a  picture.", "*The fact that Ava didn't share the dress design until showing up in it on the wedding day makes me think it wasn't actually appropriate and she knew it would be vetoed if she showed it before*\n\nI\u2019m sorry, did OP reveal to you anywhere that she required her brides maids to show her their dresses to be approved before a wedding?  I see her complaining this one didn\u2019t show her, but nothing about requiring a review of any of them to show their dresses for approval.   This is why if how their dresses are is important you either tell them all they have to show you the dresses they plan to wear for approval or put them all in the exact same dress style and color.", "Yes, but some people consider an entirely fully clothed body wearing leggings to be \u201crevealing\u201d so I\u2019d be taking that with a cellar of salt", "Or she thought she was and still expressing her own individual style (which was ostensibly why the bride let them pick their dresses). Or she was being slut shamed at her friend's wedding for an outfit she thought was modest and said whatever came to mind in the moment because it's an insane situation you can't prepare for mentally. \n\nIf I showed up to a wedding in this situation thinking my outfit was plenty modest and was told I had to leave I'd get pissed and call out the misogynistic bs too, doubly so if these people are more \"traditional\" than what most of society would call modest.", "There is literally no basis for that claim. We know nothing about the MOH.", "I think OP was just jealous of her friend. I bet her husband has a history with her and she suspects it's ongoing. The friend is probably a long lost sister who's come seeking retribution for being the one cast aside by their father and left to scrape by with their mother in Albuquerque while OP lived in luxury with her father, blissfully unaware of her suffering family. OP probably has a peg leg and only 3 teeth while the friend was the runner up for Miss Universe. I bet she stole her friend's dog after this in a fit of rage.\n\n/s", "yeah like \u201cmodest\u201d is way too broad especially if the person is unfamiliar with that family\u2019s form of modesty. Tbh especially with white christian or christian adjacent American religions imo cuz modest could be like just keep your shoulders covered or wearing anything but t-shirt length sleeves and a floor length jean skirt is immodest.", "Well multiple people didn\u2019t drop the ball.\n\nLiterally only one person dropped the ball and their response when asked why they dropped the ball it wasn\u2019t \u201csorry I misunderstood or I thought this was modest\u201d no it was \u201cI am expressing myself.\u201d \n\nLike bruh put two and two together here. All the other bridesmaids were fine and the one who wasn\u2019t talked about expressing herself not that she misunderstood."]}
