{"id": 27571, "submission_id": "16rgkhw", "title": "AITA for not having much of a reaction to my daughter coming out and introducing us to her partner?", "selftext": "My daughter is 23 and she requested dinner with us because she had some important to tell us--being my wife and I. \n\nShe introduced us and came out. My wife was emotional gave her a big hug, and told her how proud she was. I on the other hand did not react to her coming out. I honestly did not care about that part. I was honest her partner was cool, and she was very interesting. \n\nMy wife told me I was rude for ignoring our daughter's announcement. I told my wife, that I did not care who she was attracted to all I cared about was if she was happy. I tried to explain I did not care about that stuff, people like who they like I don't need labels for that. Love is love. \n\nShe said my view is slightly homophobic because it shows I am not acknowledging a different view. I do not see it that way, am I the asshole should I apologize to my daughter and her partner?\n\nEdit: For added context, I did not treat her situation as any different from her brothers. I took the time to get to know the person they were with. \n\nMy wife feels I should have treated it differently because they are different situations, ignoring that fact does not help.\n\nUpdate: Thanks for the input, everyone is right I should have just asked my daughter. I will see if she is free tomorrow for some coffee and have a chat with her. I am sure my wife's words just got to me, but only one way to find out right? \n\nThanks again.\n\nUpdate: Since it always bothered me when people would ghost on threads without giving updates. \n\nDid not have much time with my daughter she had a prior engagement but we had some coffee. We spoke about the evening, as I suspected she did not have an issue with it, and she also felt it was self-explanatory when she introduced her girlfriend--she corrected me since I said partner they view each other as girlfriend and girlfriend. \n\nThe coming out was more so her girlfriend's idea and my daughter said she was going to reach out because while she had no issues with my reactions her girlfriend thought it was weird how I kind of brushed off the response and treated this situation as if they were a straight couple. \n\nMy daughter did try to explain that is just the person I am. Explained how she preferred my nonreaction verse making it a big deal. She told the story of how she came to me first when she had her first period because she knew my wife would make a huge fuss over simple biology. \n\nI told her I made an AITA post and we laughed over some of the comments. We are going to arrange another date and this time we will have a more special event for the sake of her girlfriend. Since she did feel slightly offended by being treated as if they were a straight couple. \n\nMy daughter had no issues overall, but I will correct course. She was slightly disappointed I did not make a dad joke about her coming out. I did express that my love for her would never change, and I told her I hoped she did not wait so long because she thought I would think differently. She just told me I never told you because it was not important to her. She knew I would not care either way. \n\nI doubt I will add more updates after this I might check in every so often. I do appreciate all the varied viewpoints, and please understand it was not my intention to marginalize the hardships LGBTQA+ face in this world, I know it may be a selfish and self-centered view but I simply treat others how I wish and want to be treated. \n\nI do hope everyone has a wonderful week.", "created_utc": 1695610481, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16rgkhw/aita_for_not_having_much_of_a_reaction_to_my/", "score": 12458, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m a lesbian. When I came out to my parents they basically reacted with \u201cthat\u2019s nice, dear.\u201d My sexuality didn\u2019t change my relationship with them. IMO that\u2019s how it should be.", "INFO: How does your daughter feel?", "NTA  I will never understand what is \"homophobic\" about people treating gay children exactly the same as they treat straight children.  Isn't that the ideal that we are striving for?", "NTA. Your reaction is the right one, because homosexuality shouldn\u2019t be a big deal, it\u2019s one way of life and it\u2019s just as fine as being straight or whatever.\n\nJust talk to your daughter and make sure she doesn\u2019t wrongfully get the impression that you don\u2019t care. Explain to her that it\u2019s just that\u2019s it quite undramatic to you and that you accept her 100% and thought her partner seemed cool. She\u2019ll be happy.", "I personally think your wife\u2019s reaction was lovely and validating and I think your nonreaction was also lovely and validating. But no one here can make a judgment for you on this. Only your daughter can. INFO.", "NTA. \n\nYou responded normally. This is what we\u2019re trying to move towards. \n\nWhen I came out to my mom, she didn\u2019t have much of a reaction. Just spoke to me about how I was feeling like it was the easiest thing to talk about. I was a teenager and it made me feel good; I had been incredibly nervous about her reaction, and was very happy with how mild it was. \n\nIf your daughter herself asked for a little more validation from you, I\u2019d say of course give it to her. But I don\u2019t think big displays of emotion should be expected. Sexuality is natural, it isn\u2019t a choice. It shouldn\u2019t be more or less celebrated than someone saying they\u2019re straight.", "NAH. I do think it might come across weird if one parent gives the child a hug and the other just sits there saying nothing really to acknowledge what was said. People don\u2019t have to do a big todo, but I do think maybe matching the energy and giving her a hug too would have been better? Depends on if you regularly give hugs though, I suppose. I\u2019m doing NAH because we don\u2019t know the daughter\u2019s opinion. \n\nI had a bad coming out to my father, but I do like to imagine best case scenario would have been him saying \u201cI\u2019m glad you felt comfortable enough telling me that\u201d and maybe a hug to acknowledge how difficult it was and show that he still loves me? That would have been nice.", "NTA? You explained it yourself, I mean you could have been slightly more enthusiastic because coming out takes a lot courage. But I mean as long as you were being respectful and kind about it everything should be fine.\n\nMake sure she knows you accept her.", "NAH.  Our reactions are what they are.  She wanted you to fake surprise? Or upset? Or enthusiasm?  Did she demonstrate a lot of emotion that you ignored?  Was she crying? Or blank?  If she was emotional and you were not comforting then YTA but at face value NAH.", "I don\u2019t understand Reddit\u2026 if people aren\u2019t phased by someone coming out, many people on AITA are upset.\n\nShouldn\u2019t you be happy people have normalised gay relationships to the point it\u2019s basically a non-event? That seems like progress\u2026 not something to be upset about.", "As a lesbian, NAH- your wife wasn\u2019t wrong for showing effusive support and you weren\u2019t wrong for being supportive in your own way.\n\nHowever I don\u2019t see anything wrong at all with showing that enthusiasm, especially if your daughter took until the age of 23 to come out. Before I came out at 20 I felt like I was running so far behind my peers, living a lie, etc. etc. it\u2019s hard. If your kid is middle or early high school age when they come out, I agree, \u201cnormalizing\u201d is probably the way to go. But at 23 that is an appropriate age to show a little extra support.\n\nThe fact is that if you are 21+ right now, you did not grow up in a world that was very supportive or accepting of gay people. That merits a little extra enthusiasm, love and joy. Internalized shame is a lifelong battle.", "NTA I agree with you. Everyone is unique, identifying and coming out as something is silly. She's happy. You're happy for her. Everything's great.", "\u201cLove is love\u201d is homophobic? NTA", "NTA You normalized the situation rather than making it a huge deal or an issue. Not everyone wants grand celebrations or to be put on a giant pedestal. Treating people differently because of their sexuality isn\u2019t always the correct answer. I don\u2019t see where you\u2019d be wrong, but also it\u2019s dependent on your daughters feelings. I\u2019d ask your daughter if she had any issues with how you handled her coming out.", "NTA\n\nYou treated them the same.  Isn't that what they want is to be treated the same.  Don't overthink anything or let your wife guilt you into changing your view on things.  You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. I came out as bi to my family when I was 15. None of them made a big deal out of it. It was just normal. It made me feel safe and like it didn't matter who I loved. I don't think there always has to be this huge OMG HOORAY I'M SO PROUD moment after everyone comes out.", "NTA, you're the future. I hope that in the future coming out wouldn't even be necessary, because being gay is totally normal.", "NTA , but have you talked to your daughter? It can be very difficult to come out and while it's wonderful that you accept your daughter and love her for who she is she might have needed some reassurance of that and this was an opportunity for you to give her that reassurance. \nI'd recommend telling her how you feel and how much you love her and want her to be happy.", "NTA.  I mean, what did she want?  A party?  Seems like all most well adjusted people want in that situation is love and acceptance.", "You aren't wrong to feel how you feel.\n\n\nHowever, know your daughter probably agnosed for years over telling you & your wife. Planned it all out. Analyzed how you would react & what she would do. So it's probably a lot for you too basically just ignore it, as telling you was a hugh deal to her.", "No mention of how daughter reacted to OP\u2019s non reaction\u2026\u2026just Wife is bothered?", "NTA  \nBut did you say what you said to your wife, to your daughter? Could she tell that the silence was the silence of acceptance, not the silence of rejection?", "NTA necessarily, but definitely not homophobic. I do understand that in some situations it\u2019s not completely appropriate to have this response.\n\nSome people want exactly what you did. They don\u2019t want to be treated differently in any way. They don\u2019t want a big deal made out of it. They don\u2019t want theatrics or to feel differently from straight people at all.\n\nSome people, especially younger people, really need that affirmation like your wife gave. A lot of it depends on environment, politics in your area, and how they were raised. A lot of queer kids are terrified that they\u2019ll be ostracized, kicked out, abused, estranged, or treated poorly/differently in the long run because they come out to their parents. Even if they believe you won\u2019t be like that, it\u2019s a fear many queer people have in the back of their minds. Regardless of the fact that it should not be required for someone to even come out itfp, and that being gay should socially be treated the same as being straight, that\u2019s not the reality of the world right now, so some people would like and emotionally require more assurance from people they love/trust.\n\nIn the end I wouldn\u2019t call you an asshole for what you did, and you know your kid better than most people do, however it doesn\u2019t hurt to go talk to her about your feelings if you think it wasn\u2019t made very clear in the moment. Make sure she knows that you love and support her regardless of who she wants to date if you haven\u2019t explicitly told her, and ask if there\u2019s anything she needs from you to feel supported, or if she feels supported with how you\u2019re treating her now.", "Nta but your wife really needs to treat your daughter like she's normal. Overcompensating can be just as bad a rejection because it highlights the difference. \n\nSource: lived experience\n\nEdit: by rejection, I mean being told they don't support you, not being disowned and such. Again, I'm going off lived experience.\n\nEdit: I'm going to step back out of respect for respect to others. I was talking about a very specific scenario that should not be universalized. Please disregard this comment.", "I wish coming out wasn't a big deal for better and worse. I'm envious of your daughter, OP. You're NTA in my books. You made an effort to engage with her romantic partner. My parents refused to acknowledge my husband. **That** is homophobic. You are not. You're awesome!", "Info:\n\nDid you tell your daughter you don't care about her being gay and love her either way?\n\n\nOr did you just not acknowledge her announcement at all.\n\n\nBig difference in how either comes across.\nTell her you love her.", "NTA i think you treating her and her partner like you would anyone other family who brought their SO home is how it should be.  Normal because  it is.", "Hard to say. Ask your daughter how she feels. And then say exactly what you just did. That you just want her to be happy.", "If I was your daughter I would have appreciated your reaction. NTA", "NTA. Not everything warrants an ecstatic reaction. Just because you didn\u2019t show your emotion doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re homophobic. What the heck. It seems like your wife\u2019s just a bit overreacting. Besides the important thing to know here is what your daughter really feels as she\u2019s the one who came out, not your wife. Maybe go have a talk with your daughter about it instead. So at least you know what she really feels.", "We were having dinner when my sister came out as lesbian. I told her, \u201cok, can you pass the mashed potatoes?\u201d Still haven\u2019t lived that one down lol", "It\u2019s not homophobic obviously. But personally I feel like i\u2019d want a little reaction / acknowledgement. \nIt\u2019s a large part of herself, so it should matter to you (in a good way)", "Man I dunno why everyone expects a parade when they come out, nta. If you went above and beyond she'd probably say you're mocking her lol sometimes ya can't win.", "NTA. To say you're being homophobic is patently ridiculous. No one could ask for anything more than your attitude: all you care about is their happiness and love is love. Bravo, sir.", "NTA it doesn\u2019t matter how your wife feels or her projection onto the situation. How does your daughter feel? Maybe check in with her. Just call and say,\u201d hey, mom thinks my reaction to you coming out may have upset you.

Did you expect that to change?\"\n\"Uhh no.....let's have Mexican\"", "NAH. Your reaction was absolutely cool. In an ideal world, it should be about the person not the gender. That being said, I\u2019m pretty sure coming out to her parents was a big thing for your daughter. It would have been nice to acknowledge that a bit more.", "NTA for not having a big reaction as you obviously just want your daughter happy. However, she likely just wants some kind of recognition that involves affection. I know not everyone is tactile but as an affectionate person myself, I know I would be hurt if I didn\u2019t get a hug from a loved one, especially during an emotional moment.", "Honestly, I don\u2019t know.\nHow does you daughter feel?\nIf you feel reconsidering because of what she asked, maybe instead of asking us (not judging, just advising) maybe you should ask her if she felt wronged and act from there.\nLike if she feels you were acting like an AH, then you apologize and explain your thought process and let her know you\u2019re proud and also happy that she is happy. But if she did not feel disrespected, well, I think you\u2019re good \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA.\n\nBut I\u2019d suggest checking in with your daughter to make sure she\u2019s good with your reaction. Coming out can be a very big deal and while there was nothing wrong with how you handled it, sometimes the person coming out wants that big moment celebrated a little bit more. She may want acknowledgement that it does matter to you that she took that step to be honest about who she is. So maybe just a quick check in with her about it wouldn\u2019t hurt to make sure you\u2019re both good with it all.", "NTA, check in with your daughter with open-ended questions (e.g. \"how are you feeling about finally coming out to us?\"), then perhaps give *her* the support that she asks for\u2014not what your wife asks for you to give her. If your daughter was expecting something different, try to focus on her emotions & what that means for her relationship with you instead of the facts.\n\nI know part of me was disappointed for my parents seeming to not make it a big deal, but I worked to understand my reaction over time & trusted their support of me.", "whether you are or aren\u2019t really depends on how your daughter presented everything. \n\nSee coming out to you may seem unnecessary because none of it affects how you feel about you daughter, or anyone one else.\n\nAnd it would be great if universally being LGBTQIA was treated as just another descriptor of a person with as little fanfare as being hetro does, but that\u2019s not the reality. Being LGBTQIA can be difficult in the best circumstances when I comes to facing discrimination & hate. Even parents who have all spouted liberal beliefs and support of the LGBTQIA community suddenly become intolerant when it\u2019s their own child. \n\nDid you daughter seem nervous before making her announcement? Did you look to you & your wife for an acknowledgement of acceptance? Did she seem happy and relived by your wife\u2019s reaction & embrace? \n\nYour daughter coming out doesn\u2019t have to be important to you, but it may be very important to her & you should acknowledge that. This might be a big thing to her. She may have stressed. Not scared but stressed she won\u2019t see your enthusiastic approval. You\u2019re her dad. Your reaction to important things to her she shares with you matters to her.\n\nBut you weren\u2019t homophobic.

I\u2019m gay and some people in my family have acted completely normal around myself and my partner but then gone behind my back and expressed very different opinions.

I've never truly understood this pride in sexuality, nationality, race, and religion. Any of that. Because I am an individual, I understand how important common ground is. But I think it was George Carlin that had a take on this. Of something to the effect of \"why are we so preoccupied and proud of things we had no control over in the first place?\" Like, why do I take pride in something I didn't help manifest? I am proud of the work I do, I am proud of my accomplishments, I am proud of myself for losing weight, and I am proud of myself for working on my mental health by seeing a therapist. I HAVE ADHD, I'm not proud of that, I attempt not to be ashamed of it because I at some point bought into the whole, it's bad to be that way, but it's literally not under my control. So I KNOW it's silly to feel that way, but I do. I've just never understood why we are proud of facts about ourselves that we had no part in making a reality. Not to ruin my whole well thought out comment by being a nerd, but I think this quote encapsulates my point.\n\"I see now that the circumstances of one's birth are irrelevant.

You still support your daughter and love her, no matter who she loves. She's lucky to have that, considering it could have been so much worse.\n\nIf anything, your wife owes you an apology ASAP.", "NTA . rule of thumb is to match the tone of the person coming out i reckon . like if they seem nervous about it , reassure them and all that . if they don't want it to be a big deal, then dont make it one . ultimately its about how your daughter reacted to it , if shes fine then everythings fine .", "NTA- over a decade ago I found out my younger brother was gay. \nA week after finding out, I went to talk to him about it as he had not come out to the family yet. \nAfter a few drinks and a couple of karaoke songs, I said matter of factly,\u201dso\u2026 you are gay.\u201d \nHe was a bit shocked but responded,\u201dyes\u201d \nI followed it up with,\u201d okay\u2026 you are the same brother I had five minutes ago as five years ago \u2026 so long as you are happy, that is all that is important.\u201d\nHe eventually came out to the rest of the family on his own terms\u2026\nBut knowing that nothing changed between us was the important part.", "NAH I act indifferently to almost everything people do so I get it.

For not making a fuss, for normalising coming out and for just accepting it. \n\nYou did the right thing. This was not at all homophobic as your wife put it.

I don't see anything wrong with your reaction. It doesn't sound like you're pretending you didn't hear it or that your daughter didn't come out, just that it doesn't change your feelings for her. I would think that's the best possible outcome. I'm a cis gender hetero woman, though, so I may be speaking out of turn on that. You love your daughter and you want to get to know her partner. If you don't like her partner, it won't be because she's gay. If I was in your daughter's shoes, that's the kind of reaction I would hope for. Talk to your daughter and see how she feels about it. If she isn't upset by your reaction, then your wife needs to mind her own biscuits and let things go.", "NTA, the only reason people make a big deal out of coming out is because it does take some courage to do so.

Saying \"I don't care about your sexuality\" is minimizing to the person. You're saying \"Oh, you're gay? I don't give a fuck.\" when what you should be saying is \"Oh, you're gay?

I'm glad OP seems accepting but it's hard to say anything without knowing how the daughter felt about the reaction, which is the only important thing here.", "NTA but\u2026\n\nWhen my son came out I had exactly the same feelings as OP, as long as he was happy I didn\u2019t care who he saw, love is love etc.\n\nMy reaction though was different. I gave him a big hug, told him I loved him, thanked him for feeling comfortable enough to tell us, checked whether his peer group knew and how they took it (they did and were really supportive). I then asked loads of questions about his partner, how the met etc.\n\nI think OP could have handled his outward reaction better so it was clearer to his daughter that he supported her and that their relationship hadn\u2019t changed but a simple follow up conversation should be able to clear that all up.", "Most people who come out to their parents expect to be supported, but sometimes they get an extremely negative, heartbreaking reaction. Which would make anyone feel anxious about talking to their parents about it, because this could be the trigger that makes their parents hate them. People actually lose friends and family being gay.\n\nAfter your meeting, your daughter now knows that she is safe with her mother because her mother affirmed her identity. As for you, her father, based on your reaction she may not know your feelings, she could be wondering if you were silent because you don't agree with her \"choice\" and are secretly brooding. She might be wondering if she still has a father who loves her. Or maybe she thinks everything is fine, who knows.\n\nIf you feel there could be any doubt in your daughter's mind, I think you should give your daughter a call and just explain that your lack of reaction was because you felt like being gay is perfectly normal and having a gay daughter is also perfectly normal and because of that you ended up reacting in a completely normal way, the same as if she had announced she was straight. But in hindsight, you didn't acknowledge her bravery, and how much it means to you that she could trust you with this information, and that she can rely on you to take her side in any conflict.", "I think NAH, especially if you talk to her to make sure she understands you\u2019re fully supportive, but I want to clear up a few things:\n\n1. To everyone saying, essentially, \u201cwe did it, being queer is so normalized that no one bats an eye\u201d\u2014no, we haven\u2019t. While it\u2019s much better than when I was coming out in the early 2000s (or growing up in the 90s), homophobia is actually currently on the rise thanks to the right turning us into their current political bogeyman. Even with people who aren\u2019t outwardly homophobic, it\u2019s hard to know how someone is going to react. OP\u2019s daughter waited so long/was scared to come out for a reason. It\u2019s a challenging thing to do, I think acknowledging that and expressing appreciation of it is ideal even if you\u2019re not otherwise making a big deal over it, and it\u2019s dismissive to say queer folks don\u2019t still have oppression. I assure you, we do. \n\n2. I hope you didn\u2019t and don\u2019t use your phrasing of \u201cnot caring about that stuff\u201d with your daughter. THAT is dismissive and hurtful. A lot of straight folks think orientation is only about sex, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s who you love, and it\u2019s also part of your identity. Someone saying they don\u2019t care tells me they don\u2019t really understand or value that, nor the context of oppression mentioned above. It also, frankly, is something I have most commonly heard OVER and OVER and OVER from definitely homophobic people complaining any time an openly queer person is highlighted in the media, or shares a coming out story. They use it as a way to say \u201cstop having Pride, stop being out, stop making me aware of you.\u201d Your daughter may have experienced that kind of messaging, and if she\u2019s been identifying as queer for any period of time she almost certainly has.\n\nAll that said, I would have given a lot to have a coming out reaction from my parents like this instead of what I went through. So, maybe a few things to tweak, but no big deals.", "As a parent of a daughter that is in a same sex relationship, I have been recently surprised that so many people are homophobic in this day an age. What I've learned is that many people only have extended conversations on this subject with like minded people. What young couples are looking for in this situation is your affirmation that you support them and support same sex relationships. Now that you are the family member of a same sex couple you will find yourself in situations where you have to stand up for them because the world we live in is a very gossipy place. In a community people talk, and your wife and family need you to be able to articulate your support and acceptance. And trust me, the nay sayers will find you while you are just minding your own business... at work, at the store, just tending to your yard. People who are against same sex couples will try to debate with you and convince you that your tolerance and opinions are wrong. The best advice I can offer you now is to find ways to clearly and succinctly define your position and end the conversation. Try not to go down the road of debating with small minded folks who are just looking for a platform to bent vile and hateful thoughts.

It sounds like your wife made a big deal and you went low key, but given that your daughter asked you to a special dinner for something important, I would guess the more-looked-for reaction was the big deal one. That said there's nothing wrong with how you reacted, just that your daughter may have expected something different.

I know everyone is like \u201ctreat them the same as cishet kiddos\u201d but just because you support them and you think it\u2019s normal, doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t take a lot of courage to tell you.

And by saying, \"well, isn't that what the gays *want*?\", you're further invalidating her feelings.\n\nGive your daughter a little extra love. It's a scary thing to come out.

I never want anyone to make a huge deal and make a huge stint over who I am, that would make me as uncomfortable as someone being homophobic.\nIt\u2019s not an easy life depending on your family background, the place you grew up, how you present, etc, but when you find someone who\u2019s accepting, but not overwhelming, it\u2019s usually a joyous experience. Though, I guess for people like her, they likely want it to be acknowledged because they usually spend so much time agonizing about it that they want that time doing so validated, or else it feels like years of anguish over nothing. Which could make you feel worse, I suppose.", "I see your daughter takes after you.", "Homosexuality shouldn\u2019t be a big deal, but for many people it is.

TBH, I'm not sure why she was as nervous as she was. I've had friends of all types since high school (this was over a decade later), and am outspoken on socials and in person about human rights for everyone.\n\nOur parents are a bit conservative, but definitely not \"disown your kids\" conservative.

Some people in the closet want to come out and have it be a big show and tell. That is completely fine because you get so worked up in your head about people finding out and then how will they react?
