My wife was emotional gave her a big hug, and told her how proud she was. I on the other hand did not react to her coming out. I honestly did not care about that part. I was honest her partner was cool, and she was very interesting. \n\nMy wife told me I was rude for ignoring our daughter's announcement. I told my wife, that I did not care who she was attracted to all I cared about was if she was happy. I tried to explain I did not care about that stuff, people like who they like I don't need labels for that. Love is love. \n\nShe said my view is slightly homophobic because it shows I am not acknowledging a different view. I do not see it that way, am I the asshole should I apologize to my daughter and her partner?\n\nEdit: For added context, I did not treat her situation as any different from her brothers. I took the time to get to know the person they were with. \n\nMy wife feels I should have treated it differently because they are different situations, ignoring that fact does not help.\n\nUpdate: Thanks for the input, everyone is right I should have just asked my daughter. I will see if she is free tomorrow for some coffee and have a chat with her. I am sure my wife's words just got to me, but only one way to find out right? \n\nThanks again.", "created_utc": 1695610481, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16rgkhw/aita_for_not_having_much_of_a_reaction_to_my/", "score": 1258, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Isn't that the ideal that we are striving for?", "NTA. Your reaction is the right one, because homosexuality shouldn\u2019t be a big deal, it\u2019s one way of life and it\u2019s just as fine as being straight or whatever.\n\nJust talk to your daughter and make sure she doesn\u2019t wrongfully get the impression that you don\u2019t care. Explain to her that it\u2019s just that\u2019s it quite undramatic to you and that you accept her 100% and thought her partner seemed cool. She\u2019ll be happy.", "I personally think your wife\u2019s reaction was lovely and validating and I think your nonreaction was also lovely and validating. But no one here can make a judgment for you on this. Only your daughter can. INFO.", "NTA. \n\nYou responded normally. This is what we\u2019re trying to move towards. \n\nWhen I came out to my mom, she didn\u2019t have much of a reaction. Just spoke to me about how I was feeling like it was the easiest thing to talk about. I was a teenager and it made me feel good; I had been incredibly nervous about her reaction, and was very happy with how mild it was. \n\nIf your daughter herself asked for a little more validation from you, I\u2019d say of course give it to her. But I don\u2019t think big displays of emotion should be expected. Sexuality is natural, it isn\u2019t a choice. It shouldn\u2019t be more or less celebrated than someone saying they\u2019re straight.", "NAH. I do think it might come across weird if one parent gives the child a hug and the other just sits there saying nothing really to acknowledge what was said. People don\u2019t have to do a big todo, but I do think maybe matching the energy and giving her a hug too would have been better? Depends on if you regularly give hugs though, I suppose. I\u2019m doing NAH because we don\u2019t know the daughter\u2019s opinion. \n\nI had a bad coming out to my father, but I do like to imagine best case scenario would have been him saying \u201cI\u2019m glad you felt comfortable enough telling me that\u201d and maybe a hug to acknowledge how difficult it was and show that he still loves me? That would have been nice.", "NTA? You explained it yourself, I mean you could have been slightly more enthusiastic because coming out takes a lot courage. But I mean as long as you were being respectful and kind about it everything should be fine.\n\nMake sure she knows you accept her.", "NAH.  Our reactions are what they are.  She wanted you to fake surprise? Or upset? Or enthusiasm?  Did she demonstrate a lot of emotion that you ignored?  Was she crying? Or blank?

That seems like progress\u2026 not something to be upset about.", "As a lesbian, NAH- your wife wasn\u2019t wrong for showing effusive support and you weren\u2019t wrong for being supportive in your own way.\n\nHowever I don\u2019t see anything wrong at all with showing that enthusiasm, especially if your daughter took until the age of 23 to come out. Before I came out at 20 I felt like I was running so far behind my peers, living a lie, etc. etc. it\u2019s hard. If your kid is middle or early high school age when they come out, I agree, \u201cnormalizing\u201d is probably the way to go. But at 23 that is an appropriate age to show a little extra support.\n\nThe fact is that if you are 21+ right now, you did not grow up in a world that was very supportive or accepting of gay people. That merits a little extra enthusiasm, love and joy. Internalized shame is a lifelong battle.", "NTA I agree with you. Everyone is unique, identifying and coming out as something is silly. She's happy. You're happy for her. Everything's great.", "\u201cLove is love\u201d is homophobic? NTA", "NTA You normalized the situation rather than making it a huge deal or an issue. Not everyone wants grand celebrations or to be put on a giant pedestal. Treating people differently because of their sexuality isn\u2019t always the correct answer. I don\u2019t see where you\u2019d be wrong, but also it\u2019s dependent on your daughters feelings. I\u2019d ask your daughter if she had any issues with how you handled her coming out.", "NTA\n\nYou treated them the same.  Isn't that what they want is to be treated the same.  Don't overthink anything or let your wife guilt you into changing your view on things.  You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. I came out as bi to my family when I was 15. None of them made a big deal out of it. It was just normal. It made me feel safe and like it didn't matter who I loved. I don't think there always has to be this huge OMG HOORAY I'M SO PROUD moment after everyone comes out.", "NTA, you're the future. I hope that in the future coming out wouldn't even be necessary, because being gay is totally normal.", "NTA , but have you talked to your daughter? It can be very difficult to come out and while it's wonderful that you accept your daughter and love her for who she is she might have needed some reassurance of that and this was an opportunity for you to give her that reassurance. \nI'd recommend telling her how you feel and how much you love her and want her to be happy.", "NTA.  I mean, what did she want?  A party?  Seems like all most well adjusted people want in that situation is love and acceptance.", "You aren't wrong to feel how you feel.\n\n\nHowever, know your daughter probably agnosed for years over telling you & your wife. Planned it all out. Analyzed how you would react & what she would do. So it's probably a lot for you too basically just ignore it, as telling you was a hugh deal to her.", "No mention of how daughter reacted to OP\u2019s non reaction\u2026\u2026just Wife is bothered?", "NTA  \nBut did you say what you said to your wife, to your daughter? Could she tell that the silence was the silence of acceptance, not the silence of rejection?", "NTA necessarily, but definitely not homophobic. I do understand that in some situations it\u2019s not completely appropriate to have this response.\n\nSome people want exactly what you did. They don\u2019t want to be treated differently in any way. They don\u2019t want a big deal made out of it. They don\u2019t want theatrics or to feel differently from straight people at all.\n\nSome people, especially younger people, really need that affirmation like your wife gave. A lot of it depends on environment, politics in your area, and how they were raised. A lot of queer kids are terrified that they\u2019ll be ostracized, kicked out, abused, estranged, or treated poorly/differently in the long run because they come out to their parents. Even if they believe you won\u2019t be like that, it\u2019s a fear many queer people have in the back of their minds. Regardless of the fact that it should not be required for someone to even come out itfp, and that being gay should socially be treated the same as being straight, that\u2019s not the reality of the world right now, so some people would like and emotionally require more assurance from people they love/trust.\n\nIn the end I wouldn\u2019t call you an asshole for what you did, and you know your kid better than most people do, however it doesn\u2019t hurt to go talk to her about your feelings if you think it wasn\u2019t made very clear in the moment. Make sure she knows that you love and support her regardless of who she wants to date if you haven\u2019t explicitly told her, and ask if there\u2019s anything she needs from you to feel supported, or if she feels supported with how you\u2019re treating her now.", "Nta but your wife really needs to treat your daughter like she's normal.

Just because you didn\u2019t show your emotion doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re homophobic. What the heck. It seems like your wife\u2019s just a bit overreacting. Besides the important thing to know here is what your daughter really feels as she\u2019s the one who came out, not your wife. Maybe go have a talk with your daughter about it instead. So at least you know what she really feels.", "We were having dinner when my sister came out as lesbian.

It would have been nice to acknowledge that a bit more.", "NTA for not having a big reaction as you obviously just want your daughter happy.

She may want acknowledgement that it does matter to you that she took that step to be honest about who she is. So maybe just a quick check in with her about it wouldn\u2019t hurt to make sure you\u2019re both good with it all.", "NTA, check in with your daughter with open-ended questions (e.g. \"how are you feeling about finally coming out to us?\"), then perhaps give *her* the support that she asks for\u2014not what your wife asks for you to give her. If your daughter was expecting something different, try to focus on her emotions & what that means for her relationship with you instead of the facts.\n\nI know part of me was disappointed for my parents seeming to not make it a big deal, but I worked to understand my reaction over time & trusted their support of me.", "whether you are or aren\u2019t really depends on how your daughter presented everything. \n\nSee coming out to you may seem unnecessary because none of it affects how you feel about you daughter, or anyone one else.\n\nAnd it would be great if universally being LGBTQIA was treated as just another descriptor of a person with as little fanfare as being hetro does, but that\u2019s not the reality.

Even parents who have all spouted liberal beliefs and support of the LGBTQIA community suddenly become intolerant when it\u2019s their own child. \n\nDid you daughter seem nervous before making her announcement?

Did she seem happy and relived by your wife\u2019s reaction & embrace? \n\nYour daughter coming out doesn\u2019t have to be important to you, but it may be very important to her & you should acknowledge that. This might be a big thing to her. She may have stressed. Not scared but stressed she won\u2019t see your enthusiastic approval. You\u2019re her dad. Your reaction to important things to her she shares with you matters to her.\n\nBut you weren\u2019t homophobic.

I've never truly understood this pride in sexuality, nationality, race, and religion. Any of that. Because I am an individual, I understand how important common ground is. But I think it was George Carlin that had a take on this. Of something to the effect of \"why are we so preoccupied and proud of things we had no control over in the first place?\" Like, why do I take pride in something I didn't help manifest? I am proud of the work I do, I am proud of my accomplishments, I am proud of myself for losing weight, and I am proud of myself for working on my mental health by seeing a therapist. I HAVE ADHD, I'm not proud of that, I attempt not to be ashamed of it because I at some point bought into the whole, it's bad to be that way, but it's literally not under my control. So I KNOW it's silly to feel that way, but I do. I've just never understood why we are proud of facts about ourselves that we had no part in making a reality.

Coming out is not the same as exosting as a gay/straight person. It's sharing a part of yourself and hoping the people you share it with will accept you.

You know it when you come out. It is helpful to get a reaction that shows you are still loved and cared for. That it doesn't change anything.

I also know people who have said that coming out as gay is harder than coming out as trans. They\u2019re different sure, but everyone\u2019s perspective is different. Either way, coming out can be difficult for people for various reasons even if they think the people they are coming out to will be supportive. And either way, safety can be a concern. I gave this guy a soft YTA. I don\u2019t think his reaction was bad and as long as his daughter is fine with it, I think it\u2019s probably fine as OP knows his daughter best.

And you\u2019ll likely never know why!", "When coming out doesn't end in rejection, homelessness, or a real threat of violence, then we can treat it as no big deal. The kid was *scared* and looking for reassurance, not a party.", "This is absolutely  incoherent and not how trusting people with secrets works.", "The fact that you're putting it solely on gay people to normalise it says a lot. \nMaybe tell the rest of society to stop being homophobic before trying to blame us for how we're treated, yeah?", "Do you really believe that queer is not yet seen as normal because coming out is seen as a vulnerable moment? You think that's the reason?\nYou don't think that the excessive hate crimes, discrimination and death penalties in some parts of the world play a bigger role than some kid's coming out story?", "I'm a gay kid of a very accepting parent. I knew she would be cool with it from the very start and love me no matter what. I still only came out when I was a financially independent adult, because no matter how confident you are, if you're queer there's a tiny little voice inside of you who says \"What if they won't accept you as you expected?\"\n\nMy point is, do not invalidate how hard coming out is. Even to the most accepting family, even for the most confident people", "Maybe she just figured it out, or this is her first lesbian relationship. It took me into my 30s to figure out I was also attracted to women. You're assuming she figured it out years ago and chose to hide it in fear of a bad reaction. That COULD be true, but we have no way of knowing that based on the info here. \n\nWhile this isn't how my immediate family responded when I came out, several close friends did, and it was a huge comfort to me that it was just no big deal.

That's an action that shows acceptance, even if he didn't make a big deal about her coming out.", "Maybe, I will see tomorrow. \n\nOverall though I have always thought coming out as pointless and unneeded. I hope we get to a point where people just introduce their partners and call it a day. \n\nI thought that was the big news not her coming out.

Because, yeah, YTA then.\n\nWe live in extremely homophobic times and she was vulnerable with you, giving you the power to reject her.

Do you normally blank out when they confide in you\u2026 or do they just not confide in you?", "Well for one, she would have experience and know she was supported by someone. Why would I come out to my friends before my parents? My friends can't kick me out or tell me I'm not the kid they raised. \n\nAlso it seems like it was obvious to someone.", "I'd ask if they are upset, because mom felt the reaction wasn't the best and that wasn't the intention.

If the kid is fine, say great. I just wanted to check in and clarify. No harm, no foul. Have a great day, kid.\n\nNo way to know if the kid is hurt or not. Go ask, since it's in question.

It's hard to say where OP fell. My brother didn't get a party, but we talked. I told him I really expected him to come out earlier. He didn't. Thought I was wrong. Turns out I was right. Wasn't a big deal. We didn't have some huge emotional thing.\n\nDidn't act like he didn't say anything, though.\n\nHard to say where OP fell, but there's a mid-point between, 'I hear you and love you' and ignoring it. Or, 'I'm your sibling and more likely to call you a nerd than say I love you so that would be really forced and feel like too much, but we're cool and if you like dudes it doesn't change that I think you're a huge nerd. Nothing changes between us. Nerd.'\n\nYou don't need to roll out a rainbow carpet, or whatever.

Yes, they do confide in me, they often come to me first because I do not overreact, and I do take things in stride. \n\nIt is not a big deal, I know it is an issue in the world but that is because the world is stupid. \n\nIt is pointless cause I would never reject my kids no matter what they do. The whole world can be against them, I will always love them and if need be I will fight the world.", "Oh yeah very much true.

Some people need an affirmation directly. Others use actions. Some people really need you to spell out what you mean. I'd check with the daughter directly. She may have read his actions. She may have only heard his silence on the matter, if nothing was overtly said to her.\n\nSometimes, people need words.\n\nDepends on the daughter's communication style.", "You keep trying to use the fact that the daughter came out at 23 as evidence that she was afraid to come out for years and years...but you do realize that she could've not known she liked women until her adult years, right? Not everyone realizes these things about themselves at an early age."]}
