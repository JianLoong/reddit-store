I've been let down, neglected, lied to and discarded so many times that it took a massive amount of therapy to get to where I'm at now but events from my past still linger and can seep into my present life. One of the most prominent things that I am aware of is my struggle with being able to form meaningful and lasting attachments to other people. \n\nI can be friendly, hang out with others and actually like a person, but it will take a significant amount of time for me to genuinely care for and form a personal attachment to them. The way that I have always seen it is to not get too attached too soon because that person may end up leaving my life either through lack of interest in staying in touch or just dying. Because of this I ran through a lot of relationships saying things that I didn't mean just so I could get the positive feelings that they gave me. I can now admit that that was an atrocious thing to do and no longer act out in such a way.\n\nI am currently in a five year long relationship with my girlfriend \"Sarah\" (38f) who for some reason is able to love me in spite of knowing all my faults. However, before I met Sarah I fathered a child named \"Kara\" (19f) back in high school except I didn't know that I did until a few months ago when she reached out to me through social media. When she first reached out I had my doubts as I A) didn't see a physical resemblance between us and B) I had no idea who her mom was when she told me her name. It wasn't until Kara showed me some old pictures of her that something clicked and I agreed to submit for a DNA test. \n\nI was shocked when it came back that I was her father but accepted that it was what it was and promptly gave Kara as much as I could about my medical history and always responded to her calls, messages, and agreed for her requests to in person meetings as we actually only lived about a 3-4 car hour drive away. Kara never had a dad growing up and was so excited to meet and hang out with me. I actually started to feel bad because Kara was clearly more into having a relationship with me than I was in having one with her. It's not that I wasn't curious about her or interested in getting to know her, I am, I just don't have that instant love for her that she seems to have for me. \n\nI'm also not saying that I won't grow to love her, it's just not gonna be any time soon. Recently Kara straight up asked me why I haven't said I loved her yet and I didn't want to lie so I told her about my attachment issues and the reason for them, but I am interested in trying because she seems like an amazing person. I attempted to be as gentle as I could with this but I guess it wasn't enough because Kara has been responding to my messages less and less, AITA for not telling my daughter that I love her at the moment?", "created_utc": 1670293508, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zds8to/aita_for_not_telling_my_daughter_that_i_love_her/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019s understandably hurt and is processing.", "NAH.\n\nIt would have been cruelest to tell her you love her if you don't yet.\n\nIt might not be that alone which is putting her off though. She's probably spent her whole life wondering about who her father may be, and possibly built him up in her mind to be an epic figure. Reconciling that with a normal flesh and blood man with human failings takes some time and she's not bad for wanting some space to manage reality.\n\nI have a friend who was adopted as a baby. She loves her parents, but has always been curious about her birth mother. They connected a few years ago and met up. And as it turns out, they don't like each other. Birth mother has issues with my friend's sexuality, doesn't approve of her job (veterinary assistant - mother doesn't like animals and thinks she should have been a nurse instead), doesn't share any of her interests  etc. Friend finds birth mother high strung and judgemental. They post birthday and Christmas greetings now, and that's it.\n\nIt's a hard thing to cope with when your lifelong fantasy collides with reality. If Kara is the amazing person you think she is, she'll work her way through it. Keep the lines of communication open and just let things develop at a pace you both can live with.", "NTA. I think your daughter had an expectation on how meeting you would go and you didn't meet that. She's now dealing with emotions, that might be feeling like rejection. If you're interested in building the relationship, give her time, don't push too hard, and answer any questions she has as best as you can.", "NTA. Lying to your daughter who you barely know is worse than not jumping the gun on saying I love you. This situation sucks for both of you - she grew up without a dad and is now ecstatic that she gets to build a relationship with you. You fathered a child and found out 19 years later and are left to deal with the immense amount of emotion that brings up. \n\nShe\u2019s always known about you so she\u2019s had years to feel love for you, even if it was based on just her idea of who you might be. Once she reached out she had a person to project that love onto, and she\u2019s really lucky that you are open and willing to get to know her. Many dads in this situation wouldn\u2019t be, unfortunately. \n\nYou just found out about her, under circumstances that were out of your control. You don\u2019t have 19 years of love stored up for someone you didn\u2019t know existed. \n\nI think an honest conversation (preferably in person) about your past, and how you\u2019re feeling now is important. It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t want to love her, you just haven\u2019t had the opportunity to yet. Make sure she knows how excited you are that you have that opportunity now. I think over time this could be a beautiful relationship between the two of you. \n\nEdit to say maybe therapy would be a good idea for both of you, if it\u2019s feasible. This is a huge life altering change in both of your lives and talking it out with a unbiased third party trained in these kinds of things might be very helpful.", "NAH. She\u2019s a kid who needs validation and I also think it\u2019s responsible to be honest with her. I think reaching out to a sub or group for recently reunited bio parents might be a good idea. \nObviously you weren\u2019t made aware of her existence but she is your child even if she\u2019s legally an adult who is likely dealing with a ton of rejection sensitivity. Parents are usually expected to tell their kids they love them and this relationship isn\u2019t a romantic one, so it\u2019s not the same category as the other people you\u2019ve said it to. You\u2019re also clearly trying to be honest with those around you and work on yourself, which is laudable. \nThis is well beyond a snap ethical judgement, IMO.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t required to automatically love someone, even if they\u2019re your child. Just like a child isn\u2019t required to love you automatically. You let her know the truth, so now she has to work through her own feelings and go from there.", "NTA you were honest and not hurtful. Bonds come in time. DNA doesn\u2019t equal instant love in many cases.", "NTA I think you just couldn\u2019t live up to her hopes. No one could. It was a surprise. She knew you didn\u2019t know of her since you had to be convinced. I think your response was reasonable and kind.", "> AITA for not telling my daughter that I love her at the moment\n\nNAH. Your daughter appears to have been raised in a loving environment and can not fathom that a member of her immediate family does not love her as deeply and completely as she is accustomed to. That does not make her TA. It means she lacks life experience. \n\nYou were not so fortunate and your emotional scars impact your ability to connect with her. This does not make you TA either.", "NAH. I think that one of the reasons that the two of you are having different reactions is that she has always known you existed; everyone has a father somewhere and she has probably been picturing you for 19 years. You, on the other hand, had no idea she existed. So for her, it's not so much instant love as finally having a person to put to the love that she was feeling for the faceless \"dad\" in her mind. For you, this is totally brand new. I think it makes sense that you aren't going to instantly feel love.", "NTA - I can see how this would be a lot to process, and not everyone is wired the same. Not saying I love you, to her is of course not the same as saying you don't love her, but I can see why she would be hurt.\n\nI would imagine there is a very large difference between being present when your child is brought into this world, and learning you have a child after missing their childhood... but for me, as soon as I found out she was my child, I would feel instant love for that kid, no matter what I missed.\n\nBut that's me... You're not me. So personally, I don't think anyone has the right to judge you on this.", "YTA - unpopular opinion, but you made a decision 19 years ago that led to this, and now you have a daughter. It sounds like you\u2019ve had a tough life so it might not feel fair, but you have responsibility over your own actions and wherever they end up leading you in life. Would really have to know the details of how you communicated this to her because you try to make it sound like you\u2019re doing your best, but the subtext is that you\u2019re not fully interested.\n\nYou have another person who wants to get to know you and love you - don\u2019t turn it away.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nAnd Kara is acting her age.  Just asking why you haven't said you love her tells me that she's idealised the idea of finding you and nearly like she's is that little kid that's 3 or 4 and just wants to love their parent because they are their parent.\n\nAn older person may have developed different thoughts and had the understanding that this is essentially two strangers that have never met.  She always knew you existed.  You had no idea till you got that call.\n\nThere are different types of love as I'm sure you know.  You guys are still in the stage of getting to know each other and developing feelings that you'll fall into (not romantic).  In some ways it's nearly like a step parent situation where you come into the child's life when they are older but you just have a biological connection.  It takes time to build those other connections.\n\nI'd probably suggest some therapy for you if you haven't got any yet for your abandonment issues.  You could consider finding one that specialises in people in your situation of supporting people who connect with parents/kids after years.\n\nKara will be disappointed but you haven't broken her heart.  She's an adult.  If it was a little kid you may have just lied.  You have done a lot more than many parents in your position.  Some want nothing to do with a child they never knew existed.", "[removed]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
