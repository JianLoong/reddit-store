Her family lives across the country from us, so up until this point I had never actually visited them, but I had met them a handful of times and we've always gotten along fine.\n\nThey invited us to come visit and stay with them for a few days and we took them up on the offer. We flew in yesterday, and everything went well - her dad and I watched football while she caught up with her mom and sisters, and then we had a really nice dinner. But things went south at the end of the night when it was made clear that they didn't want me sharing a bed with my wife while in their home, and that they expected me to sleep on the couch.\n\nI honestly thought they were joking at first, but they insisted we sleep separately. I had a problem with the implication that I shouldn't be allowed to sleep next to my wife, and I also have a bad back and the couch did not look the least bit comfortable (they don't have a guest room).\n\nAfter arguing back and forth for a bit, I decided to leave and book a hotel. I told my wife she didn't have to come with me, she chose to stay and I said I'd come back the next day. I went off to a Marriott about 10m away and got a good night's sleep, trying to not let the whole situation bother me.\n\nThis morning, I called my wife asking when I should come by. She told me her parents want me to apologize for leaving the way I did. I told her that I'm willing to apologize to keep the peace, but they need to acknowledge that it wasn't appropriate to insist I can't share a bed with my own wife. She said she'd talk to them and call me back.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, I hear back from her, and she tells me that not only will they not apologize for it, they are now insisting I need to come back and stay on the couch for the rest of our visit, and if I don't agree to this, I'm not welcome back in the house. I'm pretty livid at this point - I told her that there's absolutely no chance that I will do that, and I am no longer willing to offer any sort of apology.\n\nMy wife's sisters are now bothering me saying this is just the way their parents are, that my wife is very upset, and that I need to just give in and stay on the couch for the rest of the trip before this turns into some sort of family feud. From my perspective, I don't care what they think and I'm willing to treat the rest of this trip as a solo vacation, go sightseeing and meet my wife back at the airport at the end of the week.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1675109082, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pcgym/aita_for_moving_to_a_hotel_because_my_wifes/", "score": 1271, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are a team and a partnership and this may be one instance but it is also an example of what to expect if nothing changes. I highly suggest that you have a serious discussion once it is the two of you away from her family about boundaries, respect, and partnership. If nothing satisfactory comes from that, I suggest counseling, so you have an impartial person who is an expert in this type of thing help explain and guide you guys on how to stay a team and set boundaries.

Either we both stay or nobody stays. This is a major red flag, if she sides with her parents on something this low stakes, imagine future things? Can\u2019t even imagine a child. Toxicity all around, sorry OP. Good on you for setting your boundaries but a talk with your wife is due when you get back. NTA.", "Really.", "WTH is with the fiance/caregiver denotation? Fiance is descriptive enough, no need to add caregiver as though its some kind of job title. I would be insulted to have that caregiver thing tacked onto my relationship title (and I'm a professional caregiver).", "The \"what\" and \"why\" wouldn't be the issue with me if the in-laws and wife had been upfront about it to OP (or if I were in that situation to me). \n\nSaying, \"Hey, we get you two are married, but, it's one thing to us when you two are in your own place and another when it's under our roof where we might hear something, so, if you want to get a hotel room while here we'd understand and even go halves on the cost if you want\", sure. I can see that thought process. But, they all blindsided OP with it, wife included, as she obviously would know that would be coming in her parent's house.\n\nThe problem here is the \"how\" it was handled and the responses to OP reaction. All that had to happen was parent's saying, \"Hey, we can understand you not wanting to sleep on the couch, how about we go halves on the hotel?\" But, get offended and try to make it OPs problem? Not to mention wife taking parent's side? What, are the parents rich and all the kids walking on eggshells for the inheritance money so they will do whatever parent's push????", "I'd love to see her reaction", "I don't know. It sounds funny and all but I don't see a way that marriage can survive if he keeps pushing the situation like this. Maybe some counseling would be a better idea.", "I'm imagining OP as a commercial for Corona Beer.  Just quietly chilling with a beer and a palm tree.", "He told her she could stay and she\u2019s been trying to play peacemaker since he left. Trying to fix an upset in the family is not the same as siding against her husband. OP hasn\u2019t said anything about her actually criticizing his choices either. She was being forced to choose between her family, her husband gave her a way out, she took it.", "She isn\u2019t, she stayed there and has been trying to arrange for a peaceful resolution of the argument. OP hasn\u2019t said anything about her criticizing his actions, only that he gave her a way out of being forced to choose between her husband and parents.", "These people are trying to pull a power play. I\u2019m pissed for OP too, although I think it sounds like he handled it very well. \n\n\nI would just reiterate to the sisters or whoever, *I have a bad back. I need to sleep in a bed.*", "Here\u2019s the auto mod copy since the post was removed: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10nn26p/aita_for_forcing_my_parents_to_sleep_in_separate/j69ndtf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3", "It's been removed.", "I think i sae it right here, the wife was wondering if she was the AH, but someone sujested going to petty... redit what-not. GOOD ONE, THO", "I'm curious as to whether there is anything else going on. OP doesn't give their gender or race. Is this just parents being controlling or weird about sex? Or is there something more to it such as homophobia or racism?", "I agree. Personally IMO I don\u2019t think the wife is mature enough to be married. If you still have your parents make major decisions for you and you can\u2019t set up proper boundaries for your relationship with your husband, you kinda have major growing up to do.", "Good thing you aren't in a relationship with me then, isn't it.\n\nI'll be sure to let her know that some random internet person is OFFENDED by what I call HER once she wakes up. I'm sure you'll hear her eyes rolling despite the distance.", "He's not the one pushing the situation.  The inlaws are the ones creating the situation and the wife is the one pushing it.  He's just behaving normally.", "> She was being forced to choose between her family\n\nIt should not be difficult to choose between bullies and a victim. The fact that they're giving OP shit about staying in a hotel shows that this is about control.", "By not going with him, she is effectively siding with her parents.  I\u2019m honestly baffled how you don\u2019t see this, unless you\u2019re the wife from the story.  \n\nThis isn\u2019t even a difficult call to make for her.  Her parents are disrespecting her marriage, her husband, and her.  By standing by and saying nothing, she is either tacitly agreeing with them or a coward.", "Lol, I suppose so. I'm not offended at all, its just odd and I commented on that.", "I know. I'm responding to a comment that suggests that he pushes on the situation.", "No, it's not \"odd\" to us. She's been my caregiver for the past 8 years, literally since the day I moved to be with her as I'm a disabled Gulf War veteran. She is LITERALLY in the VA caregivers program AS my caregiver. It is as much a part of our relationship as being bf/gf and soon husband/wife. \n\nThat random internet people feel the NEED to comment on someone else's relationship choices (that aren't specifically asking for advice/comments in reddit posts) is what is \"odd\".", "Oh, I see.   Honestly the whole situation sounds unfixable, esp. with the wife \"back in her childhood bed\" AND OKAY WITH IT!!!  omg I can't even imagine.", "Wow, I obviously hit a nerve. Sorry to trigger you.", "I'm trying to be hopeful, but you're right. I don't see how this can be solved without some professional intervention. Even with that seems kinda unfixable.", "lol I so agree with you. It's such a random and unnecessary detail to put in multiple times.", "+1 this thread is hysterical"]}
