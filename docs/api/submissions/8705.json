Her family lives across the country from us, so up until this point I had never actually visited them, but I had met them a handful of times and we've always gotten along fine.\n\nThey invited us to come visit and stay with them for a few days and we took them up on the offer. We flew in yesterday, and everything went well - her dad and I watched football while she caught up with her mom and sisters, and then we had a really nice dinner. But things went south at the end of the night when it was made clear that they didn't want me sharing a bed with my wife while in their home, and that they expected me to sleep on the couch.\n\nI honestly thought they were joking at first, but they insisted we sleep separately. I had a problem with the implication that I shouldn't be allowed to sleep next to my wife, and I also have a bad back and the couch did not look the least bit comfortable (they don't have a guest room).\n\nAfter arguing back and forth for a bit, I decided to leave and book a hotel. I told my wife she didn't have to come with me, she chose to stay and I said I'd come back the next day. I went off to a Marriott about 10m away and got a good night's sleep, trying to not let the whole situation bother me.\n\nThis morning, I called my wife asking when I should come by. She told me her parents want me to apologize for leaving the way I did. I told her that I'm willing to apologize to keep the peace, but they need to acknowledge that it wasn't appropriate to insist I can't share a bed with my own wife. She said she'd talk to them and call me back.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, I hear back from her, and she tells me that not only will they not apologize for it, they are now insisting I need to come back and stay on the couch for the rest of our visit, and if I don't agree to this, I'm not welcome back in the house. I'm pretty livid at this point - I told her that there's absolutely no chance that I will do that, and I am no longer willing to offer any sort of apology.\n\nMy wife's sisters are now bothering me saying this is just the way their parents are, that my wife is very upset, and that I need to just give in and stay on the couch for the rest of the trip before this turns into some sort of family feud. From my perspective, I don't care what they think and I'm willing to treat the rest of this trip as a solo vacation, go sightseeing and meet my wife back at the airport at the end of the week.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1675109082, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pcgym/aita_for_moving_to_a_hotel_because_my_wifes/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her sisters are both younger and single.", "Seriously. Their controlling will only get worse from here.\n\nBut more than that, why is your wife the messenger and not the one putting her foot down? Just kidding, I know why. Because she's used to her parents controlling her life. It's pretty telling that she chose to stay with them instead of heading out with you.\n\nYou two need to talk, and it's very, very likely your wife will need therapy to unravel the mess of her relationship with her parents--if she is willing to acknowledge the issue at all.\n\nGood luck.", "yup, as has often been said on aith; OP doesn't have an in-law problem, they have a spouse problem", "LMAO if there's an update from OP: \"Forgot to mention, wife's parents complained that it's not appropriate to sleep in the same bed as my wife when my wife and her 16 year old sister were already sharing the bed, but my wife would be sleeping between us, so the fact I sleep naked wouldn't have been an issue because there was a buffer.\"", "The entire family apparently doesn't care.", "This!!!! \n\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "Eh not really, he gave her an out so she wouldn\u2019t ostracize herself from her family. So long as she isn\u2019t siding against him, I\u2019d say he\u2019s being a very considerate partner for not making her burn her bridges with her family she rarely gets to see.", "I thought about it, but I've already taken the week off and the weather here is much nicer than where we live. I have no problem just spending the week by myself at the beach.", "Actually, I\u2019d say it\u2019s good on him for making her chose between her parents and her husband. He said that they do not get to visit, and it\u2019s a pretty tight spot for her to be in regardless.", " I am sure you and your wife could have discussed it privately and just booked a hotel.", "I think the term you were looking for is \" parents in law\".", "\"In-laws\", not \"step-parents\"", "I agree here, I would have preferred a hotel for us in the first place, but my wife wanted to be with her family the whole time. She still has her own bedroom in their home, so it didn't seem unreasonable to me.", "This...dump that broad and her looney parents.", "There\u2019s zero chance she hasn\u2019t known how her parents feel about this issue. OP said his wife\u2019s sisters specifically pointed out that\u2019s how they are, so she certainly knew it could be a problem. \n\nParents like these who pick absurd hills to die on will always make it known when they don\u2019t approve of something. Really poor response from the wife to not have his back here.", "Believe it or not, they're actually super liberal Bernie supporters. They do go to church on the regular, but I never expected this sort of behavior from them.", "Oh yeah. I'm with you. He takes the bed. MIL and wife in wife's bed. FIL on couch.", "They insisted that under their roof they didn't feel it was appropriate for their daughter to share a bed with me, despite us being married. I told them about my back, they said \"it will be fine, it's just for a few days.\"", "Exactly. This is a strange expectation, and definitely requires explanation to understand who is possibly at fault here. Considering this is a married couple, it's hard to believe there's no rationale at all.", "how they're married", "OP actually has far more of an obligation to demonstrate for his boundary-challenged wife how to establish a perfectly reasonable boundary.  I would also note that I don't understand why you would think avoiding visiting them at all might not be perfectly \"possible.\"", "This implies the family wouldn\u2019t villianize him for making his wife and their precious daughter for sleeping on the couch", "So you think OP should compromise by doing exactly as the in-laws wish?  That\u2019s not a compromise, and it doesn\u2019t address any of OPs questions or concerns. \n\nThe wife had to know  her parents would make this request, yet chose  not to tell him about it in advance. \n\nThere are lots of issues here, and OP is accountable for exactly none of them.", "Way easy to say of someone with no back issues. A bad bed can litterely cause so much pain for days. If a significant other ever asked that of you they clearly dont care all that much about you", "I know. I used to be bad in that department. It took some work, but I'm much better now. This is why I said OP has a wife problem just as much as an in-law problem. They're all bad.\n\nLook at it this way... the wife supposedly chose OP to create a family with by getting married. She didn't choose him \"except when at my parents house\". She chose him for everything. It's about time she stuck to that.", "Maybe ask the wife to support the marriage and move to the hotel with the husband...", "She **is** siding against him. She should've left her parents' house when he did.", "That would be so relaxing", "YOu still need to talk to her about whether she actually wants to be married to you or not.", "When you get back, make sure to remind your wife that she needs to sleep on the couch from now on, since it's what her parents would want.", "I am sorry what ????", "Thank you", "The biggest asshole in this situation is your wife for not having your back.\n\nYou are married. This is disrespectful towards your marriage aka her own marriage.

Which is fine. I get a hotel room and I don't have to put up with BS.\n\nAt least my fiance'/caregiver agrees with me, and stays in the hotel room, when it comes to privacy, sleeping arrangements, not worrying about whether we'll wake someone up or they wake us up, etc, etc. \n\nIn your case? If she wants to stay at the house, I'd be like, whatever... I'm not. Then deal with that later once we got back home. As for the parents wanting an apology, yeah, no, I'd be collecting my wife, telling them off, and leaving. But that's me and I have zero tolerance for BS.", "Yeah, get your wife away from her parents and talk this over with her. Let her know this level of control is not normal and you have concerns. Which you should.", "I'll never understand people like this. You're already married, you share a bed and the toothpaste is 100% out of the tube already. \n\nIs your wife the youngest?", "This is unlikely to be about religion or politics then. This is about them not respecting your wife as an adult and you as her partner.", "Wife should sleep on the couch. \n\nI'm upset for you. But I'm also irritated that your wife won't side with you. That's a bigger issue.", "Your in-law's aren't a concern. Your wife's situation is. That she's not flipping out at her parents is not normal. That she didn't go with you is not normal.\n\nIf they're this rude and controlling with a virtual stranger, I guarantee her upbringing was not always pleasant. This may be over reddit's paygrade and may be more an issue that should be addressed with a therapist.\n\nMake it clear you love her, and to let you know if her parents do anything crazy. Ignore their drama, focus on your wife and don't let anger at her parents distract you from what's important.", "\u201cWell dear MIL and FIL, no grandkids for you!\u201d\n\n\nLike another poster a few days ago, you can turn the table on them when they visit you! Mum can sleep on the couch. And dad can sleep on the floor.", "It sounds to me that they still see your wife as a child, so if she's unwilling to challenge them on this I can't see their behaviour changing.", "Right, like, what religion says husband and wife can't sleep together?", "No, he doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s a conversation to have, but running over what shred of boundaries she has left with his own boundaries isn\u2019t going to help in this moment. Other people can\u2019t build boundaries for you.", "If that\u2019s the case then I think he\u2019d be quite justified in refusing for medical reasons.", "I don\u2019t think OP should compromise, I think he should just do it. What\u2019s the point of not? There\u2019s no good outcome here and the person who is going to take the most shit is the wife because she\u2019s probably been raised by people who have trampled her boundaries until there\u2019s nothing left. That can be rebuilt, and I don\u2019t think he should do it on future occasions, but it\u2019s not a quick process.", "That\u2019s why I said he could take the bed and the wife can take the couch", "Oh I misread your comment as \"*not* a wife problem\".\n\noops!", ">\tWhat\u2019s the point of not? \n\nPhysical pain. Sleep on a couch simply isn\u2019t a reasonable thing to do with a bad back. Who\u2019s going to pay the ER  or Urgent Care cost?  What\u2019s his boss going to say when he stays home sick for a few days instead of returning to work after vacation?  \n\nIt would be much easier if wife could swap with him, but she won\u2019t even try!", "The point of not? Avoiding back pain, avoiding a reputation as a pushover, avoiding continued disrespect of your marriage, and avoiding setting a precedent.\n\nI got back problems. The amount of money required for my back surgery would be enough on its own to say a hotel would cost less overall, even if you add in any bad blood.", "That\u2019s why I suggested he take the bed and she take the couch. Unless he offered and she refused and I missed it."]}
