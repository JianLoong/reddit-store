If a distant cousin tells me that their event is formal, I am going to use my years of knowledge of how events go in my family and what kind of clothing my family is likely to own to guide what I chose to wear. So no, there is no way any of my middle class cousins have tuxedos, obviously when my cousin says formal she means suits and ties.

I\u2019ve even been a bridesmaid in a knee length dress. \n\nThat said, if an invite had a specific dress code listed, I would ask the couple - Listing a formality isn\u2019t common in my area.  \u201cBlack tie\u201d would be an automatic decline from me, but just listing \u201cformal\u201d would be more vague in my area and I would ask them for clarification before deciding on my attendance (I hate floor length dresses and would in fact decline an invite if that was the requirement).", "As has been discussed endlessly in this thread, there's the definition of each dress code term as provided by Miss Manners, and there's the cultural understanding of dress code terms that exists within specific communities. \n\nIn middle class terms, yes, a knee length dress of nice material/construction is appropriate for a wedding with a formal dress code. I've also seen it defined as \"church clothes\". In upper class circles, like those of OP's fiance's family, it's much closer to the Miss Manners definition. \n\nYou can argue about semantics until you're blue in the face, but the fact is you're always going to look tone deaf if you're totally unable to incorporate cultural nuance into your understanding of language.", "I was kinda expecting a very bridesmaid like dress, but that's a perfectly adequate dress for a wedding.\n\nThe possible concern is, given the price tag, it might be that it cost as much as the wedding dress and sister was upset they were \"flashing the cash\"? Or that it looked more formal when next to the fiance's tux? But that still doesn't make OP TA.", "Yeah, that looks ok for a formal wedding to me. Could even be used as a bridesmaid dress. If your bridesmaids were all Rockefellers lol.", "Totally agree! That dress is perfect for a formal dress code regardless of the cost. OP is NTA. Don\u2019t use a dress code for your wedding if you can\u2019t be bothered to check and see what it actually means.", "totally agree. this dress is appropriate for a formal wedding. the sister was 100% wrong.", "It\u2019s just a nice dress! In fact, it\u2019d probably be TOO plain without a bit of bling. NTA.\n\n(I thought that we were talking about some kind of Elizabeth I About To Go To The Royal Ball kind of dress!)", "I'm such a man for saying this I suppose, but... I don't see the richness in that dress.\n\nI get that all expensive clothing and designer stuff doesn't always look that way, but my point is more like - if it doesn't look like she's trying to show wealth, certainly that shouldn't be a problem. Would most other guests be able to tell the dress is expensive?\n\n*This of course is putting aside other, possibly valid reasons to think the dress is too much* as I am only commenting on the possibly perceived value being an issue.", "Maybe not on you. It would be gorgeous on someone tall with an elegant long neck and toned arms and shoulders.", "Lol valid! Something about AITA makes me act like a profiler on criminal minds I guess", "I\u2019m the same. I\u2019m engaged. Rarely say fianc\u00e9. He\u2019s my boyfriend.", "I agree", "ive never been to a wedding where anyone other than the groom is wearing a tux", "I mean, it does look odd when people are dressed fancier than the bride and groom. Especially the groom, since if the bride's wearing white she still stands out but grooms kind of get the short end of the stick.", "If OP was uncertain as she claimed, she could have very easily checked with her sister.", "Exactly. Sister (OP) should have called the bride and asked for clarifications and shown her the intended outfits of both OP and Fianc\u00e9. This could have been easily avoided and easily communicated. But neither OP nor Fianc\u00e9 chose to do that. And OP is passively  letting Fianc\u00e9 take the full blame even though they\u2019re both in the wrong in equal measures.", "Yep!

Have you always been like this or did it happen after you began dating someone rich? Do his family think well if you or do they kind of think the same of you as you think of your family? You do seem quite embarrassed of them and like you are better.

I\u2019ve been to 2 weddings, my sister\u2019s was pretty standard and I wore black jeans, a black button up, and a bow tie, as did my brother. My parents wedding however, was far less formal. It was a backyard wedding and by that I mean they literally got married in our backyard next to our pool, it was officiated by my cousin, I walked my mom down the aisle, which was our driveway and she wore a 40$ white sun dress from H&M and my dad wore bright orange floral pattern swim shorts and a teeshirt that was older than me. All the guests wore every day clothes. \n\nI also know absolutely nothing about designer clothes, and honestly if someone had worn that dress even to my parents wedding, yeah they\u2019d be upstaging people but,, not really by much. At my sister\u2019s wedding it probably could\u2019ve blended in entirely. So, unless OP was going around telling everyone about how much it cost than I don\u2019t think this is really on them.", "I\u2019ve seen jeans and flannel shirts at weddings before.

Afterall it is Formal attire......../s", "it looks like a bridesmaids dress tbh", "Pink is not white or off-white or various shade of whatever is too close to the bridal gown shade\u2026 this is clearly a \u201cmuch bigger thing\u201d than a dress.", "This is the real question.\n\nThe dress is nice but doesn't scream over the top fancy to me. unless you told me, I wouldn't have known that was a designer dress to be honest.\n\nThe necklace,  depending what it is may be over the top but still.. the dress is quite plain so an accessory wouldn't hurt much.\n\nIs she tone deaf to what her sister may mean as formal? Could absolutely be.  She should know her family well enough to know what kind of attire may be worn there. Or even just ask?\nIt does seem like there's a different issue at hand and it's more competitive in nature.", "yeah i was picturing something a much paler pink (which in dim lighting could come off white) and a bit more bridal. this is kind of ugly but seems normal formal attire", "Yeah, formal does have a specific meaning for events, but OP isn\u2019t an acquaintance who wouldn\u2019t know better than to take the dress code at face value. Like, did OP not have any gut feeling that maaaaaaybe formal wasn\u2019t meant in the technically correct way? Has she never been to family weddings before? Did she not hear any discussion around what other people were wearing? \n\nI think it\u2019s most likely that OP did have some sense that she was potentially overdressing and she should have reached out to her sister or someone else close to planning to clarify the dress code. It\u2019s possible that OP was truly clueless- we don\u2019t know the actual nature of her relationship with her sister and the family dynamics, but I feel like people should be questioning this a bit more rather than just auto \u201cOP technically correct: N.T.A!\u201d", "I have a hunch that OP realized that when her sister said \u201cformal\u201d as a dress code, that meant something more toned down than a floor length gown and tux, but was a little embarrassed to tell her fianc\u00e9. The fianc\u00e9 was correct in telling her that formal technically means those outfits would be appropriate, but he may have been unaware that it could mean something less in other families or parts of the country.", "I'm guessing it was the necklace which was probably diamonds and large.", "I understand it that OP and fiance were told it was formal black tie optional, not cocktail attire, though.", "They were told it was formal and black tie optional. Black tie = tuxedo.", "You are hilarious! Looks like a pink curtain. (Also I didn\u2019t try it on so obviously I\u2019m not referring to how it would look on me) An elegant long neck? A giraffe?", "It\u2019s a maxi dress. If you looked up tea dresses you\u2019ll get tea length dresses. \n\nThis is totally garden party wedding appropriate. \n\nIt sounds like she said formal and really meant Sunday Best.", "She was told formal she shouldn\u2019t have to check", "No OP shouldn\u2019t have it\u2019s down to the bride and groom to clarify not for guests to chase up", "Right. Formal can include black tie. But saying \u201cformal is black tie\u201d is incorrect.", "Where I am it's definitely not \"normal wedding attire.\" Since OP and her fiance were the only one dressed that way, it clearly isn't where they live either.", "I was expecting a gaudy form fitting dress. This is simple and elegant and does not appear attention seeking.

The dress op wore would be on the better dressed end but absolutely appropriate for a formal wear event.", "Ngl, weddings are the only time I *don\u2019t* wear jeans and flannel. For weddings, I suck up the gender dysphoria and wear a dress.", "I saw this exact dress posted in that sub the other day and all the commenters were saying that it was a great option for formal", "I went to a wedding last night in a dress I fucking hated because I wasn't sure if the bride would be pissed if I wore the dresses I wanted to, because they were pink. \n\nDress code semi-formal. Everything I looked up online showed some decently fancy stuff. So I borrowed this dress from my girl, to tight, short, black. Not me at all.\n\nI show up, like 5 different women were literally wearing white dresses, people had on sneakers and jeans and very casual shit. \n\nIt's so hard to figure out what goes and what doesn't.", "Upvoting you, and commenting to say I think that sub really errs on the side of Extremely Formal. Normal wedding guest attire is a nice suit for the guys, nice cocktail-length dress for the gals. Floor-length gowns and tuxes are reserved for the bridal party. The only time I\u2019ve ever worn a long dress was when the dress code specified \u201cblack tie optional.\u201d (And I live in a nice suburb of a major US city, where country club weddings are common.)", ">It's just a shapeless pink potato sack \n\nI resemble this comment.", "That would depend on whether your body is shaped like a potato.", "\"The wedding was semi-formal/cocktail attire\", and OP self described herself and fiancee as \"overdressed\".\n\nSounds like fiancee jumped to a conclusion on the black tie optional part.", "The dress looks unflattering on the model used on the official store...so I agree with you. 2600 dollars for a dress that looks like a sour candy curtain? Yikes...but whatever makes the wearer happy I suppose...", "YOU are hilarious. It is elegant. It is a dress that shows off the beauty of the wearer. What's the problem, not bedazzled enough for you", "Ignoring the price, it looks like lots of dresses I've seen in weddings. Hell, I've seen girls wearing fancy dresses for prom. Ofc it depends on where you live, and the dress code the couple has for the wedding. It just doesn't look that fancy and over the top for me.", "I expected it to be such a pale pink that it looked white", "This is all deeper than a dress. For OP wedding I would just be specific, tell them I want suit and tie, cocktail dresses.", "Same. Dresses like this pop up when you search for wedding guest dresses on Amazon.", "I know, I was like less formal than... jeans??", "I thought the dress code said \u201cformal\u201d only, and it was OP\u2019s bf who said that meant \u201cblack tie optional\u201d. \u201cFormal\u201d and \u201cbto\u201d are two slightly different dress codes.", "The first time I ever went to a wedding in the US, I was SHOCKED by how casual some guests were.

Lmao no accounting for taste with high end designers sometimes.", "I agree the fact the sister told OP she is not the bride. The color is usually the first thing to set off brides thinking someone is trying to steal their thunder.", "In that case, the dress code would\u2019ve been semi-formal, and a step above would\u2019ve been cocktail. The bride here said formal, so it\u2019s definitely meant to be a tux and evening gown affair.", "Yep. I also grew up in the rural South, and that's how formal is defined. It wasn't until I grew up that I learned there are actual rules related to various dress codes that are different from the meaning where I grew up.", "They're not different enough to make this dress 'too showy' or upstaging the bride, though.

He also was in different circles than her", "Those guests were probably simply inappropriately underdressed; you always get a few of those people. The ones that just never dress up, or refuse to.

I said not formal in the strictly defined case. \n\nFor men that\u2019s usually chinos or nice jeans and a button up shirt or a polo.
