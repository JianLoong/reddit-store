It wasn\u2019t stated on the invite that it was formal, the bride responded that way when you asked her. To me that is an indication that you should have used your knowledge of what is the norm in your family to guide your outfit. If a distant cousin tells me that their event is formal, I am going to use my years of knowledge of how events go in my family and what kind of clothing my family is likely to own to guide what I chose to wear. So no, there is no way any of my middle class cousins have tuxedos, obviously when my cousin says formal she means suits and ties.

Trying to villainize her sister. She was shaming her brother's girlfriend for wearing a mini dress. Complaining about how she didn't want her family to come to her own wedding dressed as they were at her sister's wedding (dressing formally), shaming them saying they didn't know what formal means (she keeps denying formal and black tie and thr same thing, which they are not).

I get the sense that OPs family is similar.

Best thing to do is contact the family and inform them of what she means by the true formal", "FYI formal is formal attire, black tie is a lot more formal, and what the sister meant was semi formal which is what people wore who were told semi formal", "Definitely.

OP is getting married very soon.  I wonder who picked their date first and why they're so close.  I wonder if there was a lot of competition going into this event and the dress isn't the real issue?", "My thoughts exactly. That's a perfectly acceptable dress for a guest at a wedding.\n\nIdk what op should've wear, jeans maybe?", "yeah, it looks like pretty standard wedding attire to me? if someone wore that to my wedding i wouldn\u2019t bat an eye.

Dress it up with a sleek up do and blingy jewelry for a fancy wedding, dress it down with a sun hat and sandals for a beach wedding, and so on. But considering the fianc\u00e9 wore a tux she probably went all out fancy", "May be expensive and big name designer but looks like draped bed sheets", "Sisters dress was maybe not floor length? Alone, the dress is okay fir the wedding. Paired with a rich man in a tux, the dress goes up a notch. If the groom, and other men there, were wearing regular suits, the man in the tux takes the dress up 4 notches. \n\nThe real question is what did the bride, grown, and wedding party wear? And did op know what the brides dress looked like (if it was less than ops dress). That would make a difference to me.\n\nI mean op should be relying on the party throwers advice on what to wear, not a guy who barely knows the party people.", "Yeah that dress is so simple I wouldn't even bat an eye at it.", "Exactly, the dress could easily be dressed up or down, so I'm really curious to know what the necklace and rest of her outfit looked like lol.", "This kind of dress can be dressed up and down easily. With minimal jewelry,  sandals and a simple hairstyle, it's a toned down summer outfit, with statement jewelry, high heels and a complicated updo, very formal. Given that the necklace was also part of this incredibly expensive birthday gift and the fiance wore a tux, I am guessing OP went the second route.\n\nHere is my take: OP is from a middle-class background and is marrying into a rich family that likes to throw money around (again, incredibly expensive birthday present). It's implausible she didn't know what kind of dress would be usual in her sister's wedding, or what the wedding dress would be like, or that her upper class fiance thought formal meant black tie. They dressed up to show off their money. On the other hand, sister is likely jealous and reacted the exact wrong way, overdressed people don't show anyone up, the look ridiculous.

Maybe the flashy factor was upped by the fianc\u00e9 wearing a tux, but still. OP is NTA for wearing that. I could see it being a little nicer than most guests at a semi formal wedding but not show up the bride level by any means. I\u2019m curious what other guests were wearing.", "Yeah I'm confused. That dress looks appropriate for a semi-formal type wedding, maybe even cocktail.", "Agreed, after looking at the dress it really is something I wouldn\u2019t be shocked to see someone wear to a formal event  like a wedding but that also depends on what the specific dress code for the wedding is and in this case because of the dress code - the dress is perfectly acceptable", "The fiancee wearing a tux when he's not the father of the bride or in the wedding party on the other hand...\n\nGenerally if a wedding is \"cocktail attire\" the only men in a tux would be in the wedding (and sometimes the groomsmen at these weddings also do not wear a jacket).", "As much as I like that dress, you could probably find something similar at Lulu\u2019s or something.", "Agree!

It\u2019s not my taste at all - and I usually love McQueen - but it seems perfectly acceptable formal\nwedding attire.", "I agree, but I wouldn\u2019t expect blingy jewelry to go with it, especially if OP knows her side of the family can\u2019t afford blingy things.  It could definitely come across as showing off.  I think if it was just the dress with minimal jewelry, it would have been fine", "Totally agree.
