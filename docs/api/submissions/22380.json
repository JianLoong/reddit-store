In the long run having the people you care about there to celebrate your marriage is more important than the dress code or perfect photos. Don\u2019t be embarrased.", "NTA. Formal means a long dress and it was an appropriate colour and not attention grabbing. Why is she so concerned about what everyone else looks like on her wedding day? Why are you? As to your dilemma, write black tie, white tie welcome on your invitations. People should be able to google that and dress accordingly.
