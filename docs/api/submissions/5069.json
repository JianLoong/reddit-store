I never had to struggle for anything because my mom or dad would always give it to me. I can say that I grew up spoiled but I grew out of that faze once I had my twins. Since I was so spoiled and never got in trouble for anything as a teenager I was always going to parties with my friends doing drugs and drinking alcohol. Then at 16 I found I was pregnant and gave birth at 17 to my two beautiful twins (girl and boy). Thankfully my parents were supportive and helped me through the process. \n\nMy parents had set up a trust fund for me when I was a kid and I wasn\u2019t able to access until I was 18 so when I turned 18 I moved out and got a condo. I only used my trust fund whenever it was for my kids, rent, or essentials around the house. I also took some out and put it in an emergency fund. I got a job at my dad\u2019s company so I was able to live comfortable but not keep up with the lifestyle I grew up with. \n\nWhen I was 31 I met my now husband and his daughter who was four years younger than my kids. Me and my husband dated for about four years then we got married two months before my twins birthday. On my twins 18TH birthday my parents gifted them each a trust fund of their own. It summed up to 200,000 thousand each. \n\nNow my twins are both 22 years old and both are thriving I like to give myself a pat on the back for how I raised them and not how my parents raised me. Now to issue on at hand my step daughter is now 18 years old and for the past couple of months she been saying how she couldn\u2019t wait to get her trust fund like my twins and I didn\u2019t know if she would or not because I never knew about the twins. \n\nNow when her birthday came around she did get money just not the trust fund from my parents instead the gave her a car. But to say she disappointed is a understatement. She said we didn\u2019t love her because she wasn\u2019t blood and that we\u2019ve always treated her different because she wasn\u2019t my daughter. Which wasn\u2019t true I\u2019ve loved her some the day I met her and I\u2019ve always treated her like she was one of mine. She then asked me why didn\u2019t I tell her she wasn\u2019t getting a trust fund since that was all she was talking about I told her I didn\u2019t know if she was getting one or not she then told me that I should\u2019ve made one for her myself. I tried to tell her that it wasn\u2019t possible but she didn\u2019t want to listen to me and just said she hated me. So am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I would just like to add beforehand my husband has told her multiple times to not be expecting the trust fund because she might not get it and I also told her that I didn\u2019t know if she would get one or not but she has chose to ignore us.", "created_utc": 1671394593, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zp79l1/aita_for_not_giving_my_step_daughter_a_trust_fund/", "score": 163, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But what's crazier is that nobody,  not you, not your husband, sat her down when she started to bring this up and say it probably will not happen. \n\nNTA.

Why not from her mother or her maternal grandparents?", "NTA\n\nNo one is entitled to anyone's money - biologically related or not. If someone is kind enough to gift you something, the answer should always be THANK YOU. Never \"I expected more\". This is basic human. She needs a harsh reality check. \n\nHonestly the fact that she's so entitled, making this level of a tantrum, and reacting with \"I hate you\" comments, makes me think that not getting a trustfund is in her benefit. With that maturity level, how is she going to handle coming into that amount of money?\nShe needs to learn to be grateful and appreciative. Something you had to learn by getting pregnant so young, and sounds like you instilled in your bio kids after going through that. \n\nI can try to sympathize with the insecurity of her feeling like the distinction might come from not being biologically related, but the way she handled it is concerning and disappointing. \nSounds like your parents love her, and are building a relationship with her, but have only known her for four years. This is a reality, there's nothing wrong with that, it's understanding that they havent been saving for decades for her. Instead of focusing on how she could be strengthening family bonds, she's being hurtful. \n\nIf she's worried about money for school or whatnot, I'm sure she could come up to you and your husband, even your parents and set up specific loans, requests etc. The keywords missing in her are kindness, maturity and gratefulness.", "NTA. The fact she felt it was her due is on her and to turn her nose up at a car is completely entitled behavior.", "NTA", "NTA, for one she's not expecting it from you, she's expecting it from your parents. And it's a completely unreasonable expectation for her to be in a family for such a short amount of time and expect a matured trust fund from people who aren't her family. It's good that your husband was trying to temper her expectations, but this is an issue you need to step back from. Your husband needs to put his daughter in therapy cuz it feels like something is wrong, even with her being a hormonal teenager, for her to so blatantly ignore the reality that people kept trying to tell her about and having a meltdown. She needs to work on some amount of processing and it's your husband's job to move forward on that with her", "> she then told me that I should\u2019ve made one for her myself.
