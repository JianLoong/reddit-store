I never had to struggle for anything because my mom or dad would always give it to me. I can say that I grew up spoiled but I grew out of that faze once I had my twins. Since I was so spoiled and never got in trouble for anything as a teenager I was always going to parties with my friends doing drugs and drinking alcohol. Then at 16 I found I was pregnant and gave birth at 17 to my two beautiful twins (girl and boy). Thankfully my parents were supportive and helped me through the process. \n\nMy parents had set up a trust fund for me when I was a kid and I wasn\u2019t able to access until I was 18 so when I turned 18 I moved out and got a condo. I only used my trust fund whenever it was for my kids, rent, or essentials around the house. I also took some out and put it in an emergency fund. I got a job at my dad\u2019s company so I was able to live comfortable but not keep up with the lifestyle I grew up with. \n\nWhen I was 31 I met my now husband and his daughter who was four years younger than my kids. Me and my husband dated for about four years then we got married two months before my twins birthday. On my twins 18TH birthday my parents gifted them each a trust fund of their own. It summed up to 200,000 thousand each. \n\nNow my twins are both 22 years old and both are thriving I like to give myself a pat on the back for how I raised them and not how my parents raised me. Now to issue on at hand my step daughter is now 18 years old and for the past couple of months she been saying how she couldn\u2019t wait to get her trust fund like my twins and I didn\u2019t know if she would or not because I never knew about the twins. \n\nNow when her birthday came around she did get money just not the trust fund from my parents instead the gave her a car.

I tried to tell her that it wasn\u2019t possible but she didn\u2019t want to listen to me and just said she hated me. So am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I would just like to add beforehand my husband has told her multiple times to not be expecting the trust fund because she might not get it and I also told her that I didn\u2019t know if she would get one or not but she has chose to ignore us.", "created_utc": 1671394593, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zp79l1/aita_for_not_giving_my_step_daughter_a_trust_fund/", "score": 597, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s like saying don\u2019t expect that gift you\u2019ve been asking for Christmas. \n\nNTA though, her father should have had a clearer conversation with her. There is no reason that she even thought she had a slim chance of getting one.", "I'm sure your parents footed the bill for tuition and sitters.", "Scratch your chin all you want. She knows she's different. Congratulations.", "You have your children. She is not your children. This makes that very clear. Congratulations", "My step grandparents always made me their own and never blinked. I was theirs from Day One and they never ever made me less-than. Not even once. I was treated 100% the same. From the time they met me when I was 5 until the day they died when I was in my 40s. Pure love and acceptance.", "Who are you talking to? I'm not the OP, I'm just pointing out illogical statements", "And $200,000.00 in a trust - or a NEW CAR?  Did your step grandparents provide that for you?", "Good for you leave me alone", "Lol you\u2019ll be surprised", "How easily people lie on the internet ? Nah", "Step daughter seems entitled, spoiled and ungrateful. NTA. To demand you make her a 200k trust fund is incredibly alarming and spoiled of her.", "NTA. And from my understanding trusts accumulate wealth  over  time. Your parents had 18 years for their investment to grow; only four with your SD. \n\nShe isn\u2019t entitled to your parents\u2019 money even if she feels left out. A new car is still awesome!", "So many posts on here can be summed up into \u201csome entitled brat is demanding a huge amount of money they don\u2019t deserve, but AITA?\u201d - no you\u2019re not. NTA at all. 10x more SD is the AH for complaining about a FREE CAR!", "NTA - SD sounds like an entitled brat", "NTA she got a car, and considering your family's wealth it's probably nice ass car, and her dad told her multiple times she might not get one. Would've been better if he or you had made it totally clear that she wouldn't but from the sounds of it it was your parents' decision, not yours. It sucks for your stepdaughter \\[reading $200k just now made my mouth water\\] but she needed to accept reality a while ago and not put her expectations sky high.", "NTA. She is being a spoiled brat. It\u2019s not her money. It\u2019s your parents to spend as they see fit. And for her to say you should set one up! That\u2019s BS you don\u2019t owe her anything. If anyone should set up a trust fund it should have been Her father and/or mother. Don\u2019t give her a cent. She has shown her true self. She only liked you for your money.", "Faze \u2026 almost stopped reading. \n\nESH\n\nYou didn\u2019t manage this well AT ALL. An intelligent person would have cleared this up weeks ago. Months ago. Like adults.", "NTA, you don\u2019t control your parents, and it\u2019s not your obligation. However, if you knew she was setting herself up for such a big disappointment, you could have reached out to your parents to see what they were planning. It\u2019s a big thing to leave as a birthday surprise, when a benchmark has been set. \n\nI think it\u2019s potential NAH. She just could be a entitled brat. It\u2019s easy to say the SD is spoiled, but growing up in a mixed family can be difficult.  Kids are going to be very sensitive to unfair treatment. In situations like this, kids are just aware of relative treatment to their siblings and peers. \n\nImagine being integrated into a wealthy family starting at 14. You already feel like an outsider because you are new, but you didn\u2019t grow up with the same access to wealth or security. And while OP may have treated her like her own, that doesn\u2019t mean the rest of the family did. SD potentially has 4 years of going to extended family events, and having difficulty fully relating to anybody for class reasons. \n\nChances are she also moved to a school district where the students were also wealthier than where she went before. \n\nIt\u2019s definitely not a mature reaction from the SD, but could be understandable. She may have spent the last 4 years feeling different from everybody else in her life, and padded it with a layer of denial. It\u2019s hard to be mature when you feel insecure and different from everybody around you.", "NTA. She is entitled. Also, this is not between you and her, it's your parents. She should be grateful for the generous gift they did give.", "ESH. Everyone in this story is an entitled AH.", "NTA. Tbh she\u2019s acting very entitled and ungrateful. A car is way better than nothing. It was unreasonable to expect more.", "Wow she still got a car \u2026 from YOUR parents who didn\u2019t owe her shit. Lol go tell your stepdaughter to go ask HER mother where her trust fund is.", "Nta. Those trust funds were from your parents. She's not entitled to it since she's not even related.", "NAH -- I'm going with this over N T A because I don't feel comfortable calling a teenager an asshole for feeling unfairly treated and speaking up about it. Obviously it would be better if she'd listened when you and her dad warned her in advance, but since it was \"we don't know\" and not \"you definitely won't\" I get why she would think you were just trying to keep a gift secret. \n\nYou should sit down with your stepdaughter or write her a letter saying \"Look, I do love you just as I love my own children. My parents do not feel the same way, and for that I am so sorry. I would make them see you as my daughter if I could, but I can't. I also don't have the means to give you a trust fund like your siblings got. I can promise to help you in any way feasible for me and your dad, and I'm sorry you got the short end, but unfortunately, this won't be the last time you come out on the bad side of something. I wish I could protect you from that, but sometimes that's life.\"", "Soft ESH. I think that your twins getting that much money and her only getting a car hurt her feelings for a very reasonable reason. They are getting a massive head start in life and she got\u2026 a car. That isn\u2019t even close to the same. Maybe you and her father should have set up a trust fund for her instead of whatever y\u2019all did because at least she\u2019d have something. Also idk about the great raising thing, it sounds like the silver spoon was passed from you to your twins but she was skipped over. If I had a step child, I would have advocated better for them.", "This kinda feels like a variation on the recent \"AITA for trying to make my husband give his daughter's college fund to my son, who he's only known 3 years but totally loves and should give anything for\" thread.\n\nNot enough so that I think it's fake or anything, or in the details.  Just in the general sense of \"you have to give me this thing I want or else you don't really love me.\"  Although it's more understandable (though not acceptable) from a teenager than a full-grown adult.", "Entitled brat, that's what she is.\n\nMight be a controversial opinion, but I think the extended family of the stepparent has zero obligation or expectation to provide for the stepkid. You can make an argument that if the stepparent has been on the kid's life for decades and it's the only motherly/fatherly, they should provide. But the rest of the family? That's been entitled.\nThe fact that she got a car from folk that only know her a couple of years and it's complaining shows she has zero attachments beyond the dollar's signs on her eyes. I hope OP don't enable this bs behavior.", "*contemplates* The average cost of a new car right now is about $48K, or about $12K per year the stepdaughter has been a family member officially.\n\n$12K x 18 years is $216K.  So SD basically got an equivalent amount, year for year.  Probably more in terms of how much the grandparents actually put down, since the $200K accounts had 18 years to accumulate interest.", "It was a gift from Op's parents, not something that can be taken away since she's 18.", "I\u2019ve always treated my daughters the same as far as I know I have two daughters and son and I don\u2019t treat my twins better because they have my dna", "Who TF can afford to magically come up with 200K in 4 years when a new kid marries into your family? You\u2019re making a lot of assumptions about their finances. You don\u2019t deserve a trust fund bc your parent married into wealth that doesn\u2019t belong to them.", "I don\u2019t know why you are getting downvoted here. I said something similar and got downvoted. OP is absolving herself of the decision and let the stepdaughter think there was a chance. I think this family is afraid of communication. \n\nNot arguing that the girl deserves or is entitled to the trust fund - just that she does deserve better expectation setting", "OP you use words like \u201cI didn\u2019t know\u201d and \u201cshe might not be getting\u201d. You could have easily turned those into more definitive statements by just talking with your parents, learning their intent, and communicating to the step daughter. Instead, you chose to let her wonder if she\u2019d get it and let your parents be the bad guys and communicate the news.  This is why YTA", "Your husband told her not to expect a trust fund but you told her \u201cI don\u2019t know \u201c. You should have said No , because why in the world would your parents set up a trust fund for some kid that became your official step child for only 4 yrs ? What if you guys divorce and you have new step children with a new guy ? You seem very entitled yourself, just in the answer of \u201c I don\u2019t know. \u201c. \n\nIf your parents did give with a trust fund on her bday , then it would have been a pleasant surprise. But your step daughter expecting her step mother\u2019s parents to give her a huge amount of money makes her an asshole.", "Everyone seems to disagree with me so all's well that ends well. Good luck", "Dont pay attention to that stupid comment, they\u2019re just jealous you had a nice life and they didnt", "What, you don't think a parent's new girlfriend's parents should immediately meet their kids and consider them grandkids?", "Kinda ironic how OP kids didn't end up like she was when growing up, but her stepdaughter did.", "It was also awfully nice of the grandparents to give their step grandchild a car as a present. They weren't obligated to do so.", "Dag. They told her she might not get a fund and all she did was brush them off", "OP's edit does clarify that she did warn her SD, which honestly was my biggest grievance since it wasn't clear in the post. But yeah, one call asking what's up could have set expectations rather than  having her crushed on her birthday. A car is a generous gift, but it's not a $200,000 trust fund. It might even be \"equal\", the twins had 18 years to build up, the SD had less than 7, so maybe a car is all her trust could afford. Like, at 10k a year, if they had been married for 5, that's potentially a 50k car versus 180k+interest.", "Well yeah", "Agreed. It\u2019s the lack of getting ahead of the issue that gets me. You are exactly right - learn the parents methodology of building up the trust and communicate it. Show how it adds up to a car for her and demonstrate how it is fair. When you wait for things to happen, they are harder to fix", "I am assuming they saved over time. Mostly because unless you are stupid rich, or the car is a beater, that kind of money doesn't just come out of nowhere. But again, something that could be solved with a phone call and a conversation with her parents.", "Well it could be over time, or a one-time contribution to offset some other tax stuff. Just depends on their approach with their private wealth team\n\nEdit: ha who downvoted THAT?"]}
