I am from India, and here people always live with their parents. Now, luckily, just before our wedding, my husband got a job in another city, which is very far away from his home and requires a 10 hour journey with a 4-hour flight.\n\nWe have a small house to live in as we are only 2 people. It's only a one bedroom home.\n\nHere's where the problem starts, his family doesn't understand the concept of privacy. As soon as we got married, his mom (my MIL) came along with us. She claimed that she wants to see if we will be able to manage everything by ourselves or not. She remained with us for around 20 days. In those days, we had zero privacy. She stayed in the living room and we in the bedroom, but even if we speak in whispers, it's possible to hear everything in the living room. So zero intimacy, zero personal talks, and hell, my husband won't even hug me in front of her to show her some respect. One thing to add here is that my love language is physical touch. I love cuddling, hugs, and kisses.\n\nNow, after a month, his 2 brothers have visited us. They are here currently, as I am writing this post. They both refuse to acknowledge that their brother is married. They are sleeping in the bedroom, and me and my husband are in the living room.\n\nI don't like to lose my privacy like that. Also, my BIL thinks I am a maid. I am currently not working and am preparing for an exam. I used to study for at least 6 hours a day before, but now I am spending my whole day in the kitchen and cleaning. Because my BIL needs home-cooked food 3 times a day. They refuse to order anything from outside and additionally ask me to make tea and coffee for them at least twice a day. They won't help me with even a single chore in the house. It is to the extent that they leave used utensils where they have eaten and won't even bring them to the kitchen. They are extremely unhygienic, roam around the house without slippers and then proceed to sleep in MY BED without washing their feet. I also had a small fight with my BIL yesterday that I will cover in another post. Still, I am playing happy with them, as they will leave soon.\u00a0\n\nMy problem is that I don't want any other family members to visit us. But my husband, the perfect family guy, said this is not going to happen. We won't be able to get a big house anytime soon, and he cannot stop his family from visiting. As this is disrespectful.\u00a0\n\nI am giving him the silent treatment since this discussion, and he called me AH for having this conversation.
