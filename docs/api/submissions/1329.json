This past weekend we were at a Halloween party with a bunch of my friends.  My fiance has known these people for as long as we've been together.  And while they were my friends first, they've welcomed him into the group just like everyone else.\n\nI dislike driving.  I always have.  I just don't feel comfortable driving in a lot of situations.  Traffic, city driving, highways, driving at night, etc.  All of it gives me anxiety and I hate it.  I can drive to and from my job fine and I'm ok running errands by myself. But other than that I pretty much always make my fiance drive.  Yes, he drove us to the party and he was only planning on nursing 1-2 drinks then switching to water for a couple hours to drive us home.  He's now at a point where he doesn't even ask me, he just assumes he's driving.\n\nAt the party, I was talking with a group of friends while my fiance was in the next room with some other people.  I made a joke to my friends that the main reason I agreed to marry my fiance is so that I will never have to drive anywhere ever again.  What I didn't know was that my fiance had just walked into the room and heard my joke.\n\nInstead of thinking it was funny, he said \"Oh, so I'm just a chauffeur to you?\"  I told him of course not, but it's just nice that I never have to drive much anymore because he always does it for me.  He said \"Well, guess that will have to change tonight.\"  And he slammed the drink he had in his hands and then went to the kitchen and took 2 shots right after another.  A bunch of the other guys at the party thought it was hilarious and started giving him high-fives.  But I was not pleased.\n\nThat meant that I would have to either drive us home or we would have to take an Uber, which would be very expensive.  I told him he was being immature and that I was just making a joke.  He said he doesn't find it funny that I made a joke about literally using him as a driving service.  I told him I didn't want to fight about it so I pretty much left him alone for the rest of the night.  I ended up driving us home because he kept drinking after taking shots.  I only had 1 drink the whole night.\n\nOn the way home I told him he was acting like a jerk and that it pissed me off that he reacted so poorly to a simple joke.  He said he didn't appreciate me making him the butt of a joke to my friends or to make a joke that minimizes his contributions to our relationship down to him driving me around.  I yelled at him that it was a joke and that now I have to drive us home in the dark when he knows how much I hate it.\n\nHe told me he would never make a joke like that and that I would be pissed if he told his friends \"I'm only marrying her so that I never have to cook or clean again.\"  I don't think those two jokes are anywhere near the same and I'm still pissed at him for how he reacted.", "created_utc": 1667591467, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym8jcb/aita_for_making_a_joke_about_my_fiance_always/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He does have to make a sacrifice, however small, to ensure that he is always safe to drive. And you kinda spit all over it.", "YTA apologize sincerely and have a talk about boundaries", "YTA. You owe him an apology", "You both need to learn how to take jokes. If you're going to make a joke like that then be ready to laugh at his joke saying how he never has to cook and clean again.

When someone tells you that you've hurt their feelings, doubling down and yelling \"it's a joke\" is about as immature as you can get. And i find is comparisons to cooking and cleaning pretty accurate. It doesn't seem like you care about him as an actual person, just what he can do for you.", "YTA. I have the exact same issue with driving, but I suck it up because it wouldn't be fair to any of my parents if I did this to them. How many parties that you've been to has he been able to kick back like this? Have you ever thought maybe he wants to get drunk for once, or would like to relax as a passenger for once? Most people dont like driving, they just have to. You clearly only ever have thought about yourself in this regard.\n\nAlso his joke is EXACTLY the same as the one you made.\n\nYou don't even care if he had fun or not, and even though it clearly hurt him, you refuse to apologize because he made you do something that you can and have done every day.\n\nThis is pretty entitled behaviour and your fiance deserves many, many apologies based on how long this has been going on.", "YTA. He didn't like your \"joke\". \n\n>I ended up driving us home because he kept drinking after taking shots. I only had 1 drink the whole night.\n\nThis comment was makes it seem as if you are using him. You're upset that you didn't get to drink. Instead of apologizing you doubled down on your \"joke\".\nAs someone who has a lot of anxiety about driving you should know driving is tiring and can be stressful. It's sucks that he is always expected to be the driver. You only had one drink but he always only gets to have one. How is that fair or funny?\n\nYou should apologize to him. If you won't drive, fine, you should pay for an uber half the time.", "Finally, a really easy one. YTA. Without a shadow of a doubt.", "His reaction WAS immature but he was very clearly offended by your comment. It can\u2019t be fun to always have to be the one limiting their fun because you\u2019re anxious and for you to make fun of it with your friends. And yes, those 2 jokes would be the same\u2014both inappropriate. YTA. You should apologize but instead you doubled down after you knew how he felt about.\n\nIntent doesn\u2019t equal impact, and impact of your \u201cjoke\u201d is what matters.", "YTA - not for making a joke, but for how you handled it when he was upset. You said something that hurt him and instead of apologizing you yelled at him.", "Yta....and you need to get over the anxiety....and yes it can be done because i used to be the same way when I started driving. Then i had to drive the highway to get to a wedding reception for a favorite cousin of mine(who was also the one who taught me to drive). So i sucked up the anxiety and did it....and once i did it my anxiety was gone and driving the highway was better for me than driving around my neighborhood....you need to apologize to your fianc\u00e9 and rethink how your words have consequences.", "ESH. And I don't see how a joke about him never having to cook or clean again would have been different and unacceptable if your joke is fine. I don't think either joke is fine, I think both are undermining.", "Yta he's not your personal driver and nobody cares that you hate driving loads of people do things they hate doing because thats being an adult. \n\nIt's not funny your attempt at joking was you being a dick and acting superior to show off for your friends", "YTA - it was a crap joke and it upset him so you should apologise.", "YTA, prime exactly of a person that can dish it out but not take it. His comparison to your \u201cjoke\u201d was spot on.", "YTA \n\nAnd you\u2019re a hypocrite with that last night too. \n\nMy s/o drives me everywhere bc I don\u2019t have my license due to a fear of driving. I would never even CONSIDER making him the butt of such a disgusting \u201cjoke\u201d or comment. Imagine having that little respect for your partner or their contributions to your relationship.", "YTA for doubling down in your joke when he clearly didn\u2019t find it funny. His reaction wasn\u2019t great but this is clearly an underlying issue. I\u2019d be pissed if I had to play DD at every party and it sounds like you\u2019re against Ubers because of cost. So does he ever get to enjoy himself? Not saying you need alcohol to do that, but come on, it\u2019s nice to let go sometimes.", "Here\u2019s some food for thought. Have you ever told him how much you appreciate him doing all the driving. Have you ever considered that he might like a night off from being the DD? That he may like to indulge in an extra drink or two? Has there ever been a close location where you could drive home or an Uber would feasible? In other words, have you ever really discussed this arrangement or has it just become a habit and he\u2019s now permanently and involuntarily the DD? Have you considered he may resent his involuntary designation? \n\nAnd frankly, those jokes are relevant. You\u2019re boiling down the relationship to a single chore.\n\nCould he have handled it better? Yes. (Pounding down shots and forcing you into an unplanned and uncomfortable driving situation is not cool.) Could you have handled his reaction better? Yes. (He was hurt and he has the right to feel that way and you disregarded his feelings). Relationships are work. Sometimes we say things that hurt the other person without intending to. Sometimes jokes fall flat. That\u2019s when you sit down, apologize and learn from your misstep. \n\nIt sounds like you two need to sit down and discuss this in more depth when you are both calm. \n\nA mild ESH and a reminder to communicate.", "YTA\n\nHe didn't find it funny. And shouldn't his opinion matter? I get you spoke without thinking, but words and actions all have consequences.  Is this the hill you wanna make a stand on? Or do you wanna understand his side, his feelings and maybe fix it?\n\nProbably be nice for him to be able to let loose at a party every now and again as well instead of being designated driver for all events as well.", "YTA he does something for you that he probably doesnt enjoy doing (or even if he did enjoy driving, having to do it will take enjoyment out of it) to make your life easier, instead of telling your friends youre greatful and that you appreciate him, you say youre marrying him just to have a built in chauffer- then you get mad at him for feeling taken for granted and not letting you have it your own way. If i had an entitled badge to give you id give you it.\n\nAnd before you start, yes i do understand driving and anxiety,  i suffer bad with it. But damn i appreciate that my other half picks up the slack and does the majority of the driving so i dont have to", "Jokes are supposed to be funny. So please explain the joke to me. Because it sounds like you were making a joke at his expense and you are treating him like a chauffeur. This has been something building for a long time, and I'm guessing he's been feeling this way for a long time. I'm not excusing his reaction, because it is a little extreme, however, I understand it better than I understand your need to make him the butt of the joke. \n\nAnd the comparison is absolutely fair and the same thing. Your joke implies he's a chauffeur, his hypothetical joke implies you're a maid. They are absolutely the same joke. And you definitely would not have appreciated it - just like he didn't appreciate being the joke you made. \n\nOverall, YTA. Apologize for being insensitive and talk to him about driving you around all the time. It's obviously something he's been feeling heavily about.", ">He told me he would never make a joke like that and that I would be pissed if he told his friends \"I'm only marrying her so that I never have to cook or clean again.\" I don't think those two jokes are anywhere near the same\n\nHow is it different ?", "Wow, not a good sign for things to come on either side of this relationship.", "YTA. His examples of jokes are actually rather similar. If you don't like it, perhaps rethink your stance on the joke at his expanse.   \nNot to mention that if someone is hurt by a joke you made, you apologise. \n\nWhy did you get angry over the fact that your 'joke' hurt him? He's allowed to have his feelings about this. \n\nWhen he expressed his feelings, you could've taken him aside and told him that this was not your intention and that you won't make such a comment again. Instead you doubled down and actually caused the argument. \n\nSo I guess in the end, the 'joke' itself wasn't the biggest issue. It's how you handeld his response afterwards.", "Honestly, I don't blame him for his reaction. The two jokes are comparable, you're using him for his driving, and if you did do all of the cooking and cleaning, then he'd be using you. Now that he knows how you actually think, good luck getting him to be the designated driver again. YTA.", "YTA\n\nGood for him for calling you out on it.\n\nSo many are telling you that you were in the wrong... But are you going to admit it or still find ways to justify what you said?", "YTA that\u2019s not a joke, that\u2019s you telling your friends the only good thing your fianc\u00e9 does is drive you around, nothing else. Just like your fianc\u00e9 said, it makes it seem like he\u2019s your chauffeur. I also guarantee you\u2019d be pissed if he said the only reason he married you was too cook and clean. Plus you doubled down on the joke which made it worse.", "YTA you're supposed to apologize when you offend someone. This \"joke\"(which it's not) made him feel like you chose him just so you wouldn't have to drive. A husband is way more than a chauffeur and his comparison was spot on. If he had said that he married you just so he didn't have to cook or clean... It is EXACTLY the same thing and you would have reacted just as poorly based on this interaction.", "YTA. His response was actually perfect", "I've been the one who does all the driving, and you know what? It's annoying as fuck. Especially when the other party *can* drive, but doesn't. And also doesn't make any efforts to drive more. \n\nI'm not discounting driving anxiety, I know it's real. But clearly it is an issue for your fianc\u00e9, and making this joke revealed that. \n\nYou two need to talk about expectations, and *you* should probably get some therapy to help with the anxiety. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. Go to therapy if its that bad for you to drive. To solely depend on him to drive you everywhere is just extremely codependent, and its probably frustrating for him. Hes forced, every time, to drive because he knows you're uncomfortable and he loves you. It may have been a joke, but clearly it struck a nerve that has been bothering him.", "Yta, you made a joke, he didn't think it was funny. Apologize,  come up with a few other reasons you are marrying him. I married my wife because the thought of ever not having her in my life is terrifying to me. She makes the day better, and there is no one else I want to wake up next to in the morning. \n\nTack on the fact that you enjoy and appreciate his driving for you.", "ESH. I can think of a few tedious tasks that my fiance is in charge of that I could make a similar joke about, and I don't think he'd react the same way as yours did. To me what you said is obviously a joke. That being said, I feel like there must be some under the surface conflict around your fiance always driving, or I don't think he would have taken it that badly. Or maybe you've made jokes at his expense before and he's extra sensitive to them? Idk it could be a lot of things. But I also think it was petty and childish of him to ruin the night for both of you by starting a fight right then and proceeding to get trashed so you had to drive home. So I think you both acted out and now you're both gonna have to get down to the bottom of the issues: 1. why he was so hurt by the joke you made and 2. Why his first reaction to being mad at you was to punish you. I know not everyone can afford premarital counseling, but if you can, this might be a good thing to bring up there, so you guys can have a neutral third party who can offer helpful advice for conflict resolution in the future", "YTA - If he made that joke you would be pissed. Because you would feel demoralized and used. It's how he feels about having to drive everywhere. You made light of something makes a deliberate effort to accommodate you. He gives up drinking while out or at least as much as he would want to at a party while if you wanted you could drink to excess everytime. You need to get over yourself, apologize for the joke, and apologize for you getting angry for him reacting upset over it.", "Esh. The joke was in poor taste esp since you made it behind his back. I don't drive due to anxiety either. I am grateful for everyone who will drive for me. His reaction was pretty over the top. There seems to be bigger issues in your relationship that this disagreement is fueling.", "ESH.  Your fianc\u00e9 clearly is *not* as cool with just driving you everywhere as you would like to believe he is, especially when it comes to effectively *always* having to play designated driver.  That said, he needs to actually *talk* to you about that instead of throwing tantrums at parties.  And you *both* need to put learning to communicate and handle conflict resolution better on your pre-wedding checklist, because this does not bode well.", "YTA. He heard you say that the main reason you wanted to marry him was so he can drive you around whenever you want. Not because you love. Not because you want to spend the rest of your life with him. Because, you don't want to drive. Your comment undercut his entire worth to being your chauffer, and then you were incapable of understanding how greatly you had offended him. You may have meant it as a joke but what you said deeply bothered him and you did not care about his feelings. Have you even apologized for your actions yet?", "YTA\n\n\nMy husband always drives day to day because I have trauma.. \n\n\nWhen he was hospitalised?! I DROVE every time I was allowed to visit.....\n\nI didn't pick him *because* he drives everywhere...... He LOVES it..... He doesn't drink....YES he is the ultimate designated driver..... But that is just a *bonus*.....\n\n\n\nWhen he was hospitalised? I drove the car every chance I had to see him! I drove in the dark..... I drove on motorways..... I did what was needed!\n\n\nI HATE driving but your still being an AH!", "YTA - This is just too good.\n\n\"I only had 1 drink the whole night...\"\n\nYou got a taste of how your fianc\u00e9 feels every time you two go out. Now try to imagine how it would feel if on top of the constant DD duty, you walked in on your fianc\u00e9 joking with his boys about how that's all you're good for. Yeah, maybe go apologize.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m obviously very biased myself, because I make that joke with my fianc\u00e9e all the time (usually when he\u2019s next to me) and he usually jokes that if he let me drive us anywhere that I\u2019d probably accidentally kill him (horrible driver over here).\n\nBut I will say that while you meant no offense, it\u2019s best to apologize. Jokes are fun until someone doesn\u2019t find it funny, and that\u2019s him. You made the joke in a good place, but you do need to accept that he didn\u2019t take it that way, same if he made a joke about never having to cook again because he would find it funny but you wouldn\u2019t and you would want him to apologize.\n\nJust have a chat when y\u2019all both have calmed down and he has sobered up and apologize for how it came off.\n\nEdit: Grammar", "YTA Jokes are only funny when people laugh.\n\nWhen you find yourself yelling: \"It was just a joke\" you are the problem.", "YTA. His comparison is accurate. You are saying his only worth is if he does the driving. You might not mean it that way, but that's the way it comes off.", "Well. With a little bit of luck, you've learned that jokes are only funny when both people are laughing.\n\nYTA.", "ESH. The joke is was not really appropriate and if roles were reversed I don\u2019t think you would like it. However he should have handed it privately with you instead of making a scene in front of everybody. You both acted immature.", "ESH. The both of you are being immature and silly. Y'all need to learn better form of communication instead of shitty jokes and tantrums at parties.", "YTA.  What, exactly, was funny about the joke? Can you explain it to me? Can you explain how it's any different if he said he was 'only marrying you because he will never have to cook or clean'.", "As someone who doesn't drive when the bf is around, who jokes that he's the chauffeur, I think YTA. \n\nThe difference is, my bf is in on the joke and when I said I'm with him for transportation reasons, he answered he's with me, because I make more money and we both laughed, knowing it to be a stupid in joke.\n\nA) even if you meant nothing of it and the fianc\u00e9 was being oversensitive, you hurt his feelings. \n\nB) apparently he isn't 100% on board for being the eternal Designated Driver.\n\nC) the chauffeur joke is exactly the same as the cooking and cleaning one, and you seem to be just as sensitive to the joke.\n\nSay you're sorry, and try to understand whether it was a bad day or actual resentment.", "YTA. He reacted fairly cause it didn\u2019t even read like a joke. Let alone how it came off in person.", ">I don't think those two jokes are anywhere near the same\n\nwhy? YTA", "Well. You getting mad at this only kind of proved his point? Instead of being like, \u201cya I\u2019m sorry about the joke, have fun tonight and drink, I\u2019ll drive us home\u201d. you got upset.\nI\u2019ll go YTA. Maybe slightly E s H but mostly YTA.", "YTA. He does something nice for you that you hate doing and you tell people that's the only reason you're with him. What the hell did you think was going to happen?", "YTA - stop treating him like crap.\n\nAnd get control of your anxiety.", "YTA and yeah those two \"jokes\" are exactly the same. You wouldn't appreciate it and apparently he doesn't appreciate your attempt at a \"joke\" said behind his back. What you SHOULD have done was apologize when you saw he was upset not continue on with oh well it's really nice regardless. And the \"main\" reason? That honestly isn't a funny joke at all and can see why he would be annoyed. Maybe he hates it that you always assume he'll drive as much as you hate having to drive anywhere.", "yta, while he probably never said it, I bet he was actually bothered by your lack of driving.", "Y\u2019all do realize this is a light joke right? I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t marry him just bc he drives her everywhere, and I\u2019m sure he knows that. His response was over-the-top and juvenile. It honestly seems like something else must\u2019ve been bothering him and he decided to take it out in this situation. Also for those of you saying she should\u2019ve immediately gotten down on her knees begging for forgiveness, she did tell him immediately after she made the joke that she obviously didn\u2019t mean it, instead of doubling down on it or anything. This joke was truly not bad enough to warrant a formal apology esp in front of friends in public. NTA", "YTA\n\nIf i were him I would not drive you around at all until I got a heartfelt apology.\n\nYou basically told HIS FRIENDS. \"He is my useful servant- nothing more\" and his example is valid.\n\nJokes are funny if he is the victim, but not at all funny if you are. What a hypocrite.", "YTA!  You made a \"joke\" at his expense, you know that, right? You don't have a phobia or an actual illness. You just don't want to drive.", "YTA and those jokes are *exactly* the same. I will admit that I think he's over reacted a bit here, but you totally deserved being forced to drive home. You should try acting grateful instead of poking fun.", "YTA you're fiance bends over backwards accommodating your anxiety and then... you joke about it. The worst part was that he confronted you and made it clear that your \"joke\" hurt him and you doubled down instead of apologizing. \n\nHis reaction was over the top but also I think he had to prove to himself that you valued him for more than driving (something you are still failing to show.)", "YTA. You need to apologize and do better", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>He told me he would never make a joke like that and that I would be pissed if he told his friends \"I'm only marrying her so that I never have to cook or clean again.\" I don't think those two jokes are anywhere near the same\n\nthey are though", "ESH\n\nTHAT was an obvious joke. He grossly over-reacted to an extreme and his behavior was ridiculous.\n\nThat said, he may also have some resentment over being forced to drive you around. You need to work on it since you\u2019re perfectly capable of running errands on your own. He shouldn\u2019t be your crutch. And he shouldn\u2019t always have to be the one at parties that has to switch to water.", "YTA! \n\nHis joke about having a built in maid/chef marrying you is the same as you joking that now you never have to drive. You\u2019re upset he literally put you in a situation where you HAD to drive, because of your joke. You understood you messed up, you even said it you didn\u2019t think he would hear you. You were making him the butt of the joke and now you had to deal with the consequences of your actions.", "YTA. The only reason his joke isn't the same as yours is that YOU are the bearing the brunt of his joke. This is how small you made him feel, and you're making it much, much worse by doubling down. This kind of behavior will wreck havoc in your marriage, and I hope you take a hard look at how you fight and seek some pre-marital counseling.", "edit: changing to ESH based on convo below \n\nOk I\u2019m going against the crowd here but I have to say N T A. I don\u2019t know how to drive and my partner does. We have *both* made the joke that I am with him because he can drive me places. I also make the joke that he\u2019s only with me for my cat. These are so obviously jokes because why would anyone decide to spend their life with a person just so they have someone to drive them around or because they like their pet. \nI think that his reaction is honestly way too much for what is so obviously a dumb joke that is not based in truth. However, I do think that his reaction tells you that something else is up in your relationship \u2014 either he actually resents you for having to always drive or he is insecure in your relationship. I would talk to him about this and figure out what it is.", "YTA. Looks like it's time for him to start enjoying himself at outings while you nurse a couple and drive you home. The audacity at being mad at him for being upset...", "YTA OP,  I've been with people who don't drive. ITS IRRITATING and difficult at times because we have to plan around that. You for some reason decided that it was 100% fine that your finace did practially all the driving. Did you ask him if he minded? I'm assuming not. No wonder he got super irritated at the party. And unless you have full blown anxiety that can't be treated, you need to start driving more and pick up that responsibility.", "YTA. It was terrible \"joke\".  And his comparison was totally fair. Looks like you need to get used to doing more driving. It's not fair that he never gets to cut loose and enjoy a few drinks because he knows he's the DD.", "They are exactly the same you are majorly TA, and your fianc\u00e9 should consider this is what your whole marriage will look like. He will continue to be accommodating and understanding and he will be the butt of your jokes and show you are the opposite of those two things.", "My girlfriend has the same problem with driving and hasn't ever made a joke like that.  When someone makes a joke about you to their friends behind your back it makes you feel like you aren't on the same team with them. The words \"I'm sorry. I was joking . And if you want me to take over driving more I will. \" should've been what he heard from you. Have you asked him before how he feels about having to always drive without even being asked? I thought about it for awhile because it was just a joke and he was sensitive but you are the one at fault for sure so \n\nYta", "ESH yeah, you told a joke that hurt his feelings. Why didn't you apologize? He reacted in a childish and potentially dangerous way (for his own health), which is the only reason he is an asshole in this situation. Then you yelled at him for having hurt feelings instead of allowing that you actually did hurt his feelings. Telling he shouldn't feel hurt is like hitting someone and wondering why they are upset since it didn't hurt you. And actually those jokes are comparable. BTW, if I were you, I'd apologize and then ask him why it bothered him so much. You'd like to understand so that you don't do it again.", "NTA. You made an insensitive joke, but it\u2019s not how you truly feel - is reaction was WAY too strong and shows that he feels some kind of vulnerability when it comes to your relationship. \n\nTell me, OP: does he normally over react to things or was this a one off?", "YTA. \u201cIt was just a joke\u201d has been the defense of assholes since the dawn of time. And more often than not they\u2019re not jokes, they\u2019re how you honestly feel or you wouldnt have said it. Claiming its just a joke after the fact is trying to escape culpability", "I have severe driving anxiety. My husband almost always drives everywhere. We joke about it a lot\u2026 would you have made the joke to his face?", "YTA as the person in the relationship who enjoys driving where it gives my husband anxiety, so I drive the majority of the time. If he said something like that I would also be pissed. It's not a joke to take advantage of someone doing something nice for you. You come off super entitled.", "You hurt his feelings. \n\nIt was only a joke to you. You have no right to expect him to react a certain way to a \u201cjoke\u201d. \n\nHow would you feel if he \u201cjoked\u201d about how you never drive and he has to do everything? \n\nThis is the perfect opportunity to communicate, apologize and just do better. \n\nYTA", "As someone who doesn't drive due to anxiety + previous accident.... YTA.\n\nMy bf is the one who drives us all the time. I know how taxing that can be on him. It sucks for these guys to be entirely responsible for driving. You don't know if he has been having issues being the default driver. Your joke, even if it's not that serious, just adds to his negative feelings about being the sole driver. It's unfair. Why make such a joke to others?\n\nIt's like someone who's with someone rich, making a joke about only being with them for their money. Even if it's not true, why even put that out there. Makes that person feel used and underappreciated.\n\nYou don't get to tell people how to react to a joke made at their expense in public, BEHIND HIS BACK. How does he know you didn't mean it when you were doing it without him around???\n\nAnd those two jokes ARE the same. Both make a person feel used and like that's all they're good for.", "YTA Whenever you make a joke at someone else's expense YTA.", "I think it was meant to be a lighthearted joke, but I actually think the joke he suggested about marrying you for cooking and cleaning is the same as the one you made. If you would be offended by that, then it's understandable he's offended by your joke.\n\nYou're being a hypocrite and I don't think you want to admit you screwed up. \n\nIt sounds like you don't value how much he's giving up to cater to your driving anxiety. I would HATE to play DD literally every time you both wanted to go out, and you clearly  are taking it for granted and aren't valuing it to the degree you should be.\n\nDid he handle it with maturity? No. \n\nBut honestly, you are the one that screwed up. \n\nAnd you should start budgeting to take ubers places if you can't handle driving at night, because your fiance should be able to cut loose sometimes. \n\nYTA", "I was with you til the end. I don't think you're an AH IF and only IF he already knows about your driving anxiety. I have really bad driving anxiety and my bf of over 10 years knows about my anxiety and the panic attacks that I can have at times, he's so supportive and NEVER asks me to drive. We've both made jokes about him being my taxi, together or just to friends. He's made jokes about how he'd starve to death if I weren't around. And whatever else that only 1 of us do. Like clipping the dogs nails for example, he's terrified of hurting them if he cuts too far, I've made jokes about how they'd look like Brian from family guy if it weren't for me being there. It's just jokes. But if you think his \"joke\" is offensive or sexist or in any way different from your joke then you're an AH. He could have reacted better but you could have too.", "I don't actually blame him for doing the shots since he never, ever gets a chance to let loose like that since he's always the designated driver. OP, on the other hand, never has to worry about how much they drink.", "Exactly. In what universe does yelling \"It was just a joke\" improve the situation.", "I agree with you on most points, but it sounds like you were an anxious driver and overcame it, thats different to full blown anxiety and 'facing it' doesnt magically make it go away", "Yeaaa I've been driving for 12 years and forcing myself to go places that riddle me with anxiety because I know I have to drive in those places sometimes... Still filled with anxiety everytime, sometimes having to pull over and wait out my panic attack that has my heart beating out of my chest and I choke on my own air. You don't just \"get over\" anxiety. You're confusing anxiety with just being nervous about a new thing.", ">Here\u2019s some food for thought. Have you ever told him how much you appreciate him doing all the driving\n\nYes!  All the damn time!", "It isn't.", "Such a good comparison of work you put in for your partner because you care about them. They both need to communicate better. He seems like he has been bottling up a bit of resentment over the situation, and this incident uncorked the barrel.\n\nI would have to give OP a YTA judgement for the bad joke and further by minimizing her fiance's feelings.", "Well one shows how OP is a hypocrite, and she doesn\u2019t like that.
