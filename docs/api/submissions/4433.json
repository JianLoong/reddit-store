Her dad and I both work full time jobs, where I work between 35-40 hours a week and he works anywhere between 40-45 hours. We both work mornings. \n\nMy friends Tom (23m) and Skylar (24f)had volunteered to watch Allison for us as Tom worked from home and Allison isn't known to cry very often. At first it was going great. Tom would have Allison in a separate and baby proofed room where she could play with her toys while he worked. Then Skylar would take over when she came home. \n\nWe offered pay many times but they kept refusing. And Skylar would ask us to bring Allison over if it had been a while since we asked her to help with babysitting. Finally we agreed to them having Allison 3 days a week but the made us promise to stop offering to pay them.\n\nIt was great for a while. It really worked out. But then Allison started coming home with rashes from stale diapers. She'd be extremely fussy and hungry by the time we got home. We would talk to Tom and Skylar about this and request they were more observant of her diapers at the very least. Her thrashing and screaminf because diaper ointment hurt broke my heart every time. Especially since I knew it was avoidable. They'd say yes, but after a while would go back.\n\nThey have recently started lying to get out of our arraignment. Claiming to be out of town for the week, then Snapchat us them being at home with their birds. Claim they were sick but our mutual friends would still be hanging out. And claiming that they wouldn't be at home all week for work, when Tom works strictly from home. His job doesn't even have a main office.\n\nWithout them knowing, we registered Allison with a professional daycare service. I drop her off in the morning and her dad picks her up. Word got to Skylar and Tom and now they're blowing up our phones calling us evil, shifty, and rude for not telling them they wouldn't have Allison anymore. And claiming I betrayed their trust by not talking to them about my concerns.\n\nAITA for finding a daycare for Allison?", "created_utc": 1670710916, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zi5hwt/aita_for_looking_into_professional_babysitter_for/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They refused payment (odd for so much time dedicated), and you know that they at least neglected your child\u2019s health and needs whilst in their care, which is enough reason to stop them from looking after her. I\u2019m concerned they they\u2019ve been so upset about professional day care. OP, I\u2019d be keeping an extra close eye and only supervised visits if any at all from here on in, something doesn\u2019t seem right to me.", "NTA, and you should have found a daycare for her the second you realized she wasn't being changed or fed.\n\nI am curious why they weren't charging or accepting money though.", "NTA. Why would you think that you are? They are not entitled to borrow your child like a library book.", "NTA. They're negligent of your child, you communicated this to them so many times. And if they're making excuses to get out of babysitting then I'm not sure why they want to babysit so bad. Sounds like you did yourself, them, and Allison all a favor.", "NTA. Your kid's well being always comes first. And while it would've been polite to let Tom and Skylar know you were switching arrangements, they were already gaslighting you. I'd say that pretty much frees you from any obligation.", "They were neglecting your child. NTA but if you let them have her again you definitely would be.", "NTA My mind went to a very dark place, because people don\u2019t do things that are labor intensive for free. Hopefully your kid hasn\u2019t been harmed or on the internet somewhere on the dark web", "NTA, they were neglecting your child. honestly there's something weird going on with them and I wouldnt want them around my kid", "NTA. their reaction is a major \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\n\nI\u2019m proud of you for standing your ground, they sound\u2026 weird. I\u2019d probably keep baby away, especially unsupervised. Again, a bizarre overreaction on their end.", "NTA, and I would make an appointment with the pediatrician before she starts daycare.

No question about it.\n\nIf this was so important to them, then they should have addressed the concerns.", "NTA! The arrangement was bad from the beginning in my opinion. A one year old need way more stimulation, company and care then sitting alone in a room with her toys wile the babysitter works. It would be bad for her development from the beginning even if they fed and changed her properly. And the fact that they became this upset about day care is just a gigantic red flag for me. Don\u2019t let her see them unattended anymore.", "NTA, something just seems off about this whole story. Insisted you not offer to pay even though they\u2019re looking after child for three days a week for what I assume was a while. Then start neglecting child and get angry they\u2019ll no longer have access to child.", "NTA.\n\nIt's abusive to the child allowing her to sit in dirty diapers to cause rashes and not feeding her properly. \n\nAlso, as similar comments, this screams and sets off warning flags. Call it the gut feeling, but a 23 year old male stranger spending all day at home with your female infant is entirely questionable.\n\nDoubly so when they are already neglecting and potentially abusing the kid. I would not trust them again, especially with their defensive and angry response", "They complained about you not talking about your concerns? After you clearly talked about your concerns?\n\nYou have the right to hire another babysitter for your child for whatever reason you see fit. And these people were not taking care of your child properly. NTA.", "NTA. You did tell them about your concerns and then they started backing out on their own. Seems like they've made it pretty clear they aren't interested in watching your kid.", "NTA its your responsibility to take care of your kid. I have a 2.5 year old and a 6 month old and if i saw rashes I would have noped out immediately. Fuck their feelings and take care of your kid", "NTA\n\nI am unsure how they could be upset.  They were lying to avoid having to babysit.  They were not very good babysitters.  Diaper rash is a BIG deal.\n\nThe only thing you could have done different is tell them when you started looking for a service.  It could have been a simple, well, she is getting older and I know it is a difficult with your all's schedule, so we are going to looking into daycare.  It is also time for socialization and that stuff.  \n\nHopefully you all can calm down and go back to being friends.", "NTA girl, the separate room was your first clue that Allison was going I be neglected. Never let those two watch her again.", "You're acting in the best interest of your kid. Who cares if their feelings were hurt? They weren't taking good care of your child. You're prioritizing your child over them, which is exactly what you should be doing. NTA.", "NTA \n\nYou found someone to properly care for and nurture your child while you're at work. That's parenting.", "NTA.\n\nYou talked to them about your concerns and they didn't fix the problem. If they still aren't taking care of your kid well, it's perfectly reasonable that you'd put her somewhere that you knew she would be well taken care of. And I don't see why they're mad about not getting her anymore when they were lying about being busy so they could avoid having to get her?", "NTA they were neglecting your child", "Ya'll are doing fine, but darn if i can figure out their angle... NTA.", "Something is very off about them, based on their reaction to not being able to babysit her anymore- why would they react so strongly about losing the opportunity to babysit a small child for free\u2026.? \n\nPlease do not let these people around your daughter again.

Whatever the case, I think the baby is much better off in a professional facility while her parents are working.", "As for the visits, we haven't seen them in three weeks, so they haven't been around Allison. And I don't see that changing. I just have this sick feeling in my gut and I don't know if it's guilt or instinct.

This whole situation is really creepy.\n\nIf the former babysitters *are* doing criminal videos, they might lie and say that OP and her husband were complicit to try and lessen their punishment when they get caught.  \n\nOP and her husband would be wise to start some sort of a paper trail about their babysitter concerns ASAP.  Perhaps they could get a consultation with an attorney with some criminal law experience.

Why on earth they would refuse money and be absolutely livid to find out they couldn\u2019t watch the baby every day raises some serious red flags. I would also consider not being friends with them tbh, something is seriously off. I honestly don\u2019t even think you owe them anything - cut your losses. \n\nNTA - good for you to enrol her in a real daycare.", "Listen to your gut. Our guts are rarely ever wrong.", "No offense, but I would almost recommend law enforcement be involved at this point if they press or continue further.\n\nThey were already neglectful and abusive. Their continued defensiveness is a huge red flag.", "Thank god. Even reading this I got a little sick to my stomach.

I mean skin tingling super weird! \n\nIt really is not normal behaviour", "NTA.  Im sorry but I would be terrified of what could of been going on over there.  Take that baby to a doctor asap to get her checked out!", "NTA. I hope your family can easily go NC because Tom & Skylar shouldn't be anywhere near your daughter or tbh you.\n\nI also don't think this is giving a 1 year old the attention they need: \"Tom would have Allison in a separate and baby proofed room where she could play with her toys while he worked.\" Sadly Tom & Skylar seem to have way bigger issues than that though.

You know something doesn\u2019t add up", "Try a different brand of diaper too. She may have developed an allergy to them. This happened to my son and the rash was horrible", "You are absolutely doing the right thing.  \n\nAnd regardless of what you learn from your pediatrician, do NOT let these people look after your daughter ever again, for any reason.", "And everyone very well could be! The internet can spiral quickly. But it\u2019s important that you cover all bases, just in case. Be strong mama - time to move forward with strength, doing the best you can for Allison.", "It\u2019s quite possible that she has a bad diaper rash or an allergy to the diaper or something being used to wipe her.\n\nThrush or yeast is also a common issue for babies who stay damp too long\n\nHowever, on the off chance these options aren\u2019t the case, it is important to let your paediatrician know that you had people caring for her whom you no longer trust. If it has been multiple weeks and you have been doing your best to heal the diaper rash then it may be necessary to test for other causes", "That is the best case scenario but there are a lot of worse ones..", "Abuse is about power.\n\nSo they either find or create victims to abuse.\n\nPredators hunt prey. That's why racists become cops and child molesters choose to work around kids.", "I hope that\u2019s all it is and nothing more sinister"]}
