Recently she has been experiencing extreme mental breakdowns & it's affecting me, my generalized anxiety disorder & my chronic health problems causing flare-ups\n\nShe scoffed at the idea of going to counseling & looked down on me for having to use it last year because I couldn't control my anxiety. I'm very proud of the progress that I have made but she is stunting it & making it worse. I do not want to go back to the way I was before when I struggled to get to class every day\n\nAt first, she had a breakdown about being worthless but recently it manifested into this friendship insecurity. I should preface this by saying we share a dorm & the majority of our class schedule because of our major so I don't get a lot of time by myself & recently I need it so much more so I shut my bedroom door more & this causes her to have even more insecurity. During one of her breakdowns she told me \"I can't lose you\" I became instantly uncomfortable. It was like she was placing our relationship on a much higher pedestal than I was comfortable with. Then it became easier to see her bad qualities. She always shit on my interests & she is prudish & doesn't like it if I call any actor or character attractive. She says things like \"even though I never watched twilight I just know it's bad because everyone says it's bad\" I'm not even the one to bring twilight up all the time & she will shit on it every time she gets a chance knowing that I really like those movies. I don't expect her to like them as well but I would appreciate she stop when I asked her to but she never does\n\nAnyway, after that, I have been trying to distance myself & do things on my own. I became Vice president of a club I was a member of & that caused even more problems. It caused more insecurity because now I will have to associate with other people who are not her. She told me she was jealous that I was able to talk to other people & that is causing insecurity because she can't & it's not my fault\n\nThen we had a long conversation where the gist of it she expects me to be normal to help her feel normal. I have to be the completely normal one even though I am uncomfortable with acting like nothing is wrong between us. She wants me to start every conversation with her &whether or not she responds to me. She expects me to keep starting them even when she doesn't respond. To me, this is very discouraging & makes me not want to start any conversations with her if she is going to act that way. Anything I do without her makes her uncomfortable & she will act rude about it if I just say that I am not walking back to the dorm with her. Everyone is saying that I'm the bad guy here & should understand & try harder considering our history. I can't help that I am uncomfortable in our current situation & emotionally  exhausted from being the one that is constantly expected to make her happy", "created_utc": 1667248615, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yio6vv/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_a_friend_anymore/", "score": 6, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You got the right idea. Run, don't walk, away from her.", "NTA. It sounds like she is in a very unhealthy state, but if she refuses to seek help there isn\u2019t much you can do. It\u2019s not a healthy friendship and you don\u2019t have to remain in it if it is having a negative effect on you. Unless you were also at school together before this, you don\u2019t actually have a lot of history with her and even if you did it is still ok to let friendships go if they are toxic.", "NTA- your friendship is toxic, like when she shits on what you like or you going to therapy and improving yourself sounds like jealousy that you are getting better shes trying to bring you back down. Also the fact shes making you into her therapist and worse making you start everything that has to do with her that is not a real friendship. Since you live with her I suggest to move into a different dorm if you can. But everything she said about you starting convos first just dont do it its your life. Dont bend to her you have to be firm cause this is causing unnecessary stress. You are probably someone who hates conflict but you can\u2019t just bend over backwards for someone whos not doing the same for you.", "NTA. Her behavior toward you has soured the friendship, that\u2019s not your fault. All these friends saying you\u2019re TA, they sound like a great support system for your roomie, they can take over the job of keeping her feeling secure.", "NTA, get help moving if you can this situation is unhealthy", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you have advised her to get therapy, and she refuses to do so, then you can't help her. Don't sacrifice your own mental health for someone who refuses to get help."]}
