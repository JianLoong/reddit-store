Even then, until me and my siblings were old enough to be up on our own he got to sleep in Saturday and she got Sunday.", ">I mean, not only does he get to sleep in while OP watches the kids and takes care of the household, as well as dictate they go to church despite OP having no interest in this, but he adds another task to OP\u2019s plate that he should be perfectly capable of doing himself?\n\n*Because he was up late playing video games.* I am not against video games at all, I think this is an area where partners can be hard on each other, but, if you are an adult and have something important going on in the morning - make a best effort that starts the night before by going to bed at a reasonable time for those important things.", "I totally understand you, and I've been there... but it really seems like this is the actual issue here. You're completely NTA for the original not waking him up, since he didn't say anything ever in the past. But I feel like asking your partner to wake you up for something on occasion if you oversleep isn't unreasonable in general. And your resistance to that idea isn't so much to the waking up itself, as the fact that you hate going to church and you don't get to ever take time to yourself and sleep in like he does. \n\nFrom his perspective, you're being obstinate about a fairly trivial ask, when actually it's that you resent being forced to spend several hours a week observing a faith that you don't believe in. You feel that if you ever spoke the truth about how much you hate going, it would cause a significant amount of argument. I'm not in your relationship, so I can't say whether such an argument would lead him to realize that he needs to respect your time and beliefs, or if it would just leave you feeling more unheard and disrespected. But currently what you're doing is ignoring your own feelings in the name of keeping the peace. Honestly, I think everyone does that on occasion. But how often do you do that in your relationship, and how much of a toll does it take on you?", "NTA. A make believe magical man in the sky will be fine with your husband not going, it's about time adults stopped believing in fairy tales.", "NTA you're right, it's not your responsibility. Your husband is an adult... I suggest you remind him of that fact.", "NTA. Your husband is a grown adult. He is responsible for managing himself and gis time accordingly. You are his wife, not his mother, so you do not need to be chasing him out of bed like he's a child about to be late for school. You were taking care of your actual children. If he's finding it so hard to get up on time, he should lay off the video games.", "NTA. I game late into the evening, yet I can still get up when my alarm goes off. He knew he was forfeiting sleep to prioritize staying up. You're not his mom.", "NTA\nHis problem, his religion, his sleep. How dare he expect you to respect his beliefs?  Hell your only option is divorce!", "NTA\n\nHim shouting at you isn't very christian now, is it?...", "NTA. He\u2019s a grown man if he wanted to go he would\u2019ve gotten up. Glad he apologized", "NTA. You\u2019re not his mommy. You\u2019re supposed to be partners in managing your family and it sounds like he\u2019s leaving that all to you. I wouldn\u2019t even do it if it happens again. If it\u2019s that important, he can figure it out. You were busy cleaning the house he should also be cleaning, and caring for the children he should also be caring for\u2026 he is after all, a parent too. I don\u2019t know why we give men a pass on this stuff. He\u2019s a grown adult. Or should be. Also check out the Fair Play book. It\u2019s changing things like this for me.", "If he can\u2019t even be responsible for waking himself up, what are his other responsibilities around the house? Seems like you\u2019re carrying the load allowing him to go to work and relax by playing video games. What are you getting out of this arrangement???", "Maybe he should accept that his choice to stay up late playing video games was the reason he couldn\u2019t get out of bed. When does he get up with the children and let you lie in? Maybe ask him for that and then you might consider waking him up if he needs it.", "It's not a favour though is it if he's still pestering OP to be responsible for his wake up times when she's already busy with everything else.", "Who'd have thunk it, eh!", "I was thinking more lean into the fire and brimstone. Level one, out swim and evade the whale. Level ten, get all the animals on the Ark without getting eaten. Level twenty, you\u2019re the one righteous person trying to escape sodom. \n\nI don\u2019t have the best handle on Christianity, but the love and peace stuff wouldn\u2019t be a very exciting game.", "I am not a morning person, at all. Before our youngest was born (gets me up at 6am every morning) I was forever pushing the snooze button and then rushing to get the other boys off to school. So I asked my husband, who leaves for work around 4am, to call me at 6.45am and chat to me for a bit to help me wake up. He did it every morning without complaint. \n\nThe difference is, he didn\u2019t mind doing that for me and I would not have blamed him if I didn\u2019t get up, missed his call or he couldn\u2019t call for any reason. I think she doesn\u2019t want to be his alarm clock because 1. He\u2019s making her go to church which she has denounced and has zero interest in and 2. He\u2019s staying up playing video games and leaving her to get up with and look after the children whilst he \u201ccatches up on sleep on his days off\u201d. Think there is a lot of build up resentment going on that she needs to communicate.", " If he needed sleep that bad she was taking care of him  he was sleep deprived and still stayed up late.", "That's passive-agressive. You need to tell him when you want to sleep in.", "A parent shouldn\u2019t need woken up by another parent, especially if he was pulling his weight around the house and with the children. So no, I didn\u2019t defeat my own point. \n\nWho do you think woke OP up?\n\nIf his goal was to make his wife happy then he would be a equal contributor to his house. Not a teenage boy who sleeps in while she does all the chores and looks after HIS children.", "Nta, my boyfriend does the same thing with his alarms sometimes. I always feel bad afterwards, but sometimes it's hard to tell when someone is \"sleepwalking\" for lack of a better word\nSounds like you two were able to come up with a solution after you both calmed down, though, so that's good!", "He is a grown man. He chose to turn his alarm off which indicates he does not want to get up to go to church.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Tell him to set multiple alarms, just like any other adult who needs to be somewhere in a timely manner. Phones make it really fucking easy so there is literally zero excuse. It\u2019s HIS sleep schedule, and he needs to be a big boy and manage it himself.", "NTA. And it appears your husband also says you are NTA but has just asked in the future that you do this as a favour for him. \n\nWhy are you posting here?", "YTA\n\nLet me explain. My husband and I both work 3rd shift and I also sleepwalk. I sleep yell and I sleep hit, my sleeps are pretty disturbed. I will shut off my alarms or chuck whatever is nearest me across the room to get it to shut off. This is all in my sleep. So asking your spouse to help you with something like waking you up when they are already up doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal to me. During the weekends I\u2019m normally the first one up and I\u2019ll wake my husband if there is something important that he wants to do. But he wakes me up during the week or if I had a particularly bad sleep.", "Nta. You are not an alarm clock or his mother", "I never understood the need to \"go to Church\" to be religious? Isn't God omnipotent? Can't he see/hear you where ever you are and whatever you are doing? Knows your thoughts, even?\n\nYou can be devout and do kindness to anyone, anytime and God will know, right?\n\nHe didn't ask you to make an appointment to get your \"Devotion Grade\" for that day. It's more to \"see and be seen being religious.\"", "I have it on personal authority that Jesus is also a big fan of Jedi survivor and will forgive him for missing church", "NTA. He's a grown adult and needs to get his own behind out of bed if he has something he wants to go to.", "NAH\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong; your husband woke up and panicked and took it out on you; he later apologised and asked you to wake him up in the future if he turns off his alarm again. \n\nSounds like a healthy marriage to me. \n\nI'm assuming you don't have a problem helping your husband get up in the future; that *would* make you the asshole.", "Time for him to put his big boy pants on and either go to bed earlier, or to set multiple alarms. NTA", "This is kinda wild to me.  It seems like such a non-issue.  \n\n\nWaking up late for something is always kind of chaotic, so people overreact.  The husband did.  But he apologized.  So that should be good.  \n\n\nI know reddit is wild, but I can't imagine being in a partnership where you ask your partner to make sure you get up or remind you of something at a given time.  Hey, I want to watch the game at 7, can you tell me when it is 630?  And your partner is like, \"No, you are a grown adult.\"", "Sounds like a typical Christian - making their problems someone else's responsibility. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, absolutely loathe when grown men act like teenagers and treat their partner like their mother. Why didn't you get me up for school... So unattractive.", "The suggestion of a therapist makes sense if he is unable to enforce a bedtime, but a sleep doctor? When he is most likely just choosing to not go to bed at a time that allows for adequate sleep and was therefore still deeply asleep when his alarm went off? He should at least TRY going to bed on time first.", "Yeah I literally play games as much as I can because I can hang out with my long distance friends and I genuinely just enjoy playing. You know what I never do? Stay up all night playing games the night before important stuff. I have strict cut off times. That way if I work/have an important task or event I'm not drained the next day. It's incredibly irresponsible to just stay up however late you want, and then refuse to get yourself up in the morning. I'm only 23, if I can do it, he can.", "I think that when a partner says no to a small request like this, there's often a reason why. An uneven work load, multiple arguments about late game nights, things like that and this last drop of more work becomes the breaking point. Is it nice to wake your partner when they oversleeps? Of course. But as a new chore when you're already doing more than your part? Nope.\n\n(And I say this as a woman that usually gets woken up by my husband on weekend mornings because I hate alarms on weekends but can sleep all day. I take care of him and he takes care of me.)"]}
