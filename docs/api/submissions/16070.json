From your post and your comments, he's falling well short in several areas.\n\nYou know - divorce is very hard, especially on kids, so should not be taken lightly - but it's not as damaging as their parents staying together in a toxic relationship where they learn all sorts of terrible habits that will infect their future relationships (platonic as well as romantic). I'm not only talking about your husband's unrealistic demands, I'm also talking about your passive and enabling behaviours (which I know are attempts to reduce the tension and arguments, but your kids will just see you accepting his awful treatment).

In your case your husband is making a choice to stay up late.  I would be tempted to tell him \"You need to get to the root of the issue, and that's staying up too late - do you want me to nag you to get off your video games at night?\" but he may be the type to call your bluff.  Simply tell him that you firmly believe adults are responsible for waking up on time for regular schedules (work/school/church).  You could gently remind him that staying up late often results in sleeping through the alarm.Then grey rock the problem.  Continue doing your own thing in the mornings and simply don't respond if he tries to argue with you afterwards.

Wash, rinse, repeat \"It's not my responsibiity to wake you up.\"  Be calm, and trust that this really isn't your responsibility.

He finally had to figure out how to get to bed on time if he wanted to get to school/work on time.  Bosses and church officials don't really accept the \"my wife wouldn't wake me up\" argument.

I've been irritable if woken up at that point. I was in like, high school, but anyway. If he's getting that little sleep it's going to become a health concern. I think he needs to be careful to not stay up too late if he can help this, because asking someone to wake you up when you're in that state is unfair.\n\nI think you should have a discussion with him and say that when he's so tired that he doesn't remember what he's doing and lashes out at people out of character that it's not fair to ask you to wake him up and risk him lashing out at you without realising it. He should definitely commit to taking steps to get more rest if he wants you to help him wake up on time.", "Gaming is more important than God to him. Not your problem.", "Well, didn't he apologize? He was wrong for getting upset. Is there an issue with waking him next time?", "No. Easy answer, but he apologized and admitted he was in the wrong. Right? You did the right thing. \n\nI'm saying that now he has asked you to do him a favor. As a partner, he would like you to do a simple act of waking him if he slept in. Forget the reddit hivemind.

We can't know the entire scope of what they do for each other within the relationship. It could be bad or good. You'd have to ask her about it directly to get to the bottom of it either way.", "Not at all what that meant but okay! I mean she was up and seen him shut off his alarm. But no where did he ask her to be his human alarm clock that\u2019s stretching it", "May I ask to elaborate on how I come off as aggressive?
