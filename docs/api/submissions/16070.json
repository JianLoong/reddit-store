My husband (35M) still is, and going to church as a family is important to him. So I still go a couple of times a month. \n\nMy husband has gotten into playing a video game in the evenings and will stay up very late to play, especially on the weekends. He was up fairly late last night. I don\u2019t know what time he went to bed, and honestly, he isn\u2019t sleeping enough during the week and will make up for it on his days off by sleeping in really late.\n\nChurch was this morning. I was woken up by our small children, and his alarm for church went off around the same time. He got out of bed, turned it off and went back to sleep. This isn\u2019t unusual, sometimes he will do that and sleep for another 30 minutes, or sometimes he will wake up not feeling well and go back to bed. This time, after he didn\u2019t get up for a while, I figured he wasn\u2019t feeling well and had decided to sleep in.\n\nI took care of the kids and house chores all morning. He ran out of our room around 11am and angrily asked me what had happened. When I told him he had turned off his alarm, he was upset and said he didn\u2019t remember doing that. He was upset with me for not waking him up and asking if he wanted to go to church. \n\nI was pretty upset and didn\u2019t react well. I told him that a) I didn\u2019t know that him going back to bed wasn\u2019t a purposeful choice and b) I don\u2019t want to even go to church, so why is it my responsibility to wake him up for it? \n\nWe got into an argument. He came back later and apologized for being upset and for what he said, but he asked me to wake him up if that happens again. \n\nI am wondering if I am in the wrong for not waking him up?", "created_utc": 1682874590, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133xcxu/aita_for_not_waking_up_my_husband_for_church/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let's be real, you knew it wasn't a purposeful choice- he's big into church, that he'd want to go, that it's important to him to go.  You're trying to rationalize excuses that sound better but this was a pretty passive-aggressive move.   You don't believe anymore. You don't want to be involved in church. You don't want to be asked or pressured to go to church.  You've already said as much in your other comments.  \n\n\nThat's where the disdain is coming from.
