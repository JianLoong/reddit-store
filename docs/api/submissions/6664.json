Both my parents are from Turkey and they\u2019re both muslim, and, on the other hand, I\u2019m an atheist. It doesn\u2019t really matter, but we live in Spain. Both my parents are 100% supportive of me not caring at all about any religion and not believing in any of them. Every now and then we all have civil conversations about religions, and their impact on the world, and wether the world would be a better place without religion or it wouldn\u2019t. The point is, this is what a healthy relationship with your parents would be like. You\u2019re basically saying that your mother is forcing you to believe in something, to respect something you couldn\u2019t even care less. That is toxic behavior. I can imagine the stress you went through because of your mother and I 100% understand why you would snap at her. It\u2019s also a good thing, this way she knows about your point of view, and that you\u2019re (probably) not going to change your mind about it (totally ok if you do tho haha) and that she needs to accept that.\nBottom line, NTA.\n\nBtw, English is not my first language so forgive me for any grammar or vocabulary errors I may have made :)", "NTA\n\nBut she literally told you this was her approach:\n\n>My mom has said multiple times that I should act like a true member of the \"Hoshino clan\" or she'll disown me.\n\nIt sucks that your mom is treating you this way.

Your mother is giving you the silent treatment because that is all she has. The only way she can defend herself. She is obviously trying to make you uncomfortable enough that you will back down, apologize, and let her keep ruling over you. You have a year or less before you are fully an adult and can wear whatever you want. I hope you will find a way to get out from under her roof.", "Personally, I'd say NTA. While it is sad that there's  no interest towards an heritage that's literally half your DNA, I do understand exactly why, considering how it's been pushed into you for what it sounds to be your whole life. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTeenagers are rebelious, the moer one tries to control their actions and tastes, the more they will rebel. You might develop an interest towards the broader aspects of the japanese culture later in life.

It doesn't need to be via your mom, and the way your mom is Japanese isn't the only way - there's obviously Japanese feminism, and lots of incredible parts of Japanese culture that might resonate with you. Losing your culture sucks, and finding ways to connect with it will add a depth and beauty to your life.", "Ummmm, if shes so interested in you being Japanese, why is your father German and why are you living in a western country? Does she not care about her Japanese heritage? What you said is true and your mom needs to learn to accept this. NTA", "NTA.

It's great that you're standing up for yourself instead of letting other dictate for you, please keep it up.\n\nAlso it sounds like your mom has some weird complex about not being part of one of the \u516c\u5bb6 clans, because she sounds like she's trying to imitate modern day Fujiwaras/Minamotos. If you think this is going to be enough of a minefield to navigate for a long enough time to warrant the extra effort, it might help to research the topic to predict her behavior, such as her current silent treatment. But given your age if you intend on walking out on her on your next birthday don't worry about it. It's just a classic tale of an abusive parent demanding their perverted, inflexible definition of perfection on their children and is a reflection of her, not you.", "NTA. She left the clan when she married your dad. So if you should behave like a member of a clan than it should be the one of your father.", "NTA. But just so you know there are plenty of liberal feminists in Japan that are your age. Times are changing in Japan. And in all fairness, when you are in your late 20s you are unlikely to have the aversion to Japanese culture you are having now. \n\nIts important to realize your mom grew up very differently than you. Japanese society is leaps and bounds different then Western and that's not a bad thing. It's likely that she was hoping she could share that culture with you or at least teach you to respect it. She probably wanted to bond with you over it. And honestly she is probably suffering over feelings of isolation living in Western culture (Just speculation on my part as she might be well acclimated). \n\nDid she go about things the wrong way? Yes. Do you deserve Japanese values and culture crammed down your throat? No. \n\nCould a little tolerance and patience be used on both sides. Most definitely.", "NAH,\n\nYour mom is trying her best to instill your culture in you. From the sounds of things it seems she's done a good job given that you can speak Japanese fluently. \n\nI don't agree with her saying you'll be a \"HO\" etc but you're still quite young and coming into your own. You may not care about your own culture now, but who knows you might find interest in it later in life. Or maybe not. \n\nYou were pretty harsh but your mom just can't be dishing insults and not expect any retort. When you're up to it, maybe apologize and try again. As a father, I'd be hurt if my son said the same thing about my culture. \n\nBest of luck.", "No, but our culture and heritage comes in part from the traditions passed down by our parents, not just where we happen to be geographically, and that does contribute to the definition our lives.", "NTA.\n\nThe good news is in a year or less, you can GTFO.", "ESH\n\nThere will come a day you wish you learned about your heritage.
