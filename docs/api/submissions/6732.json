First vehicle I've gotten myself in over a decade. My nephew began collage over the summer but had no car for transportation and I was only going to get between $500-$1000 for it for trade in or sale anyways so I decided to be a \"cool uncle\" and give it to him for free as his first vehicle.\n\n It was a 2008 Dodge and in pretty good shape drove well had some problems such as the oil pan leaking and a some other minor work. So I brought it up with my brother his father of course that I wanted to give my nephew my old car as a gift for free I wasn't asking any money from them but made it clear that they would have to pay for anything pertaining to the transfer to them and update the inspection or anything else that needed to be done I let them know of any problems I knew of with it. \n\nWhen asked why I was getting a new car I told them I had thought it was time and I had a job and budget to get one I had been thinking about it for a few years and finally decided I should just do it. They agreed and they took it to a mechanic they trusted he had to do about $540 worth of work on it for brakes, Inspection, Oil pan, and some other minor work. He said not to worry about the bill hed work it up later. \n\nMy nephew was excited when we gave it to him when he was visiting on the weekend. So now he doesn't have to bum rides or take a bus. \n\nWell a couple months go by and the mechanic finally gets around to making out the repair bill that Like I said came out to about $540. Well my brother now wants me to pay the bill and says I should have paid for all the work before I even gave it to my nephew. My response was I told you what condition I knew off about the car and that any repairs or transfer payments would be there responsibility. \n\nNow they are acting like I've cheated them somehow. When all I can think is that I gave them a car at no additional cost other then repairs and somehow I'm the asshole what do you guys think?
