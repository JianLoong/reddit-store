First vehicle I've gotten myself in over a decade. My nephew began collage over the summer but had no car for transportation and I was only going to get between $500-$1000 for it for trade in or sale anyways so I decided to be a \"cool uncle\" and give it to him for free as his first vehicle.\n\n It was a 2008 Dodge and in pretty good shape drove well had some problems such as the oil pan leaking and a some other minor work. So I brought it up with my brother his father of course that I wanted to give my nephew my old car as a gift for free I wasn't asking any money from them but made it clear that they would have to pay for anything pertaining to the transfer to them and update the inspection or anything else that needed to be done I let them know of any problems I knew of with it. \n\nWhen asked why I was getting a new car I told them I had thought it was time and I had a job and budget to get one I had been thinking about it for a few years and finally decided I should just do it. They agreed and they took it to a mechanic they trusted he had to do about $540 worth of work on it for brakes, Inspection, Oil pan, and some other minor work. He said not to worry about the bill hed work it up later. \n\nMy nephew was excited when we gave it to him when he was visiting on the weekend. So now he doesn't have to bum rides or take a bus. \n\nWell a couple months go by and the mechanic finally gets around to making out the repair bill that Like I said came out to about $540. Well my brother now wants me to pay the bill and says I should have paid for all the work before I even gave it to my nephew. My response was I told you what condition I knew off about the car and that any repairs or transfer payments would be there responsibility. \n\nNow they are acting like I've cheated them somehow. When all I can think is that I gave them a car at no additional cost other then repairs and somehow I'm the asshole what do you guys think? Should I have paid or chipped in for the repairs or what?\n\n\nEdit: My Nephew is pretty freaking awesome and is the only reason I'm not demanding the car back. He's super grateful about it and would pay for it but his father said he'd take care of it and not to worry. So he doesn't know any of this is happening and he wouldn't go against his father anyways.\n\nThe only one that's causing any kind of fuss is my brother (his Father). My mother is upset because she agrees with what everyone has said so far but my brother has an attitude problem about the strangest things and she wants to pay for it to avoid any family fighting or drama. I've told her don't do it but I'm assuming she will behind my back just to keep my brother happy.\n\nEdit 2: By the time the car was taken to the mechanic the car was completely in their name (Not sure if nephews or my Brothers) Title and all as far as the DMV was concerned the car was the property of my Nephew. Also I was accused of not telling them everything that was wrong with the car. I told him that I told them everything that I knew of at the time and if and when they took it to a mechanic there maybe more wrong with it since I'm not a mechanic myself.", "created_utc": 1673106941, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/105s95t/aita_for_not_paying_for_the_repairs_for_a_car_i/", "score": 1454, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Being a teenager, I can well believe he doesn't.  The deal was, I give you the car you pay any repairs.   If it were 5K I might understand, but $500, unless your brother is in bad financial status, really isn't a lot as car repairs go.

We just need a larger car. She kept complaining and asking my dad to either fix or do regular maintenance on the car years after owned it. She complained to our entire family about how unfair my dad was and how he sold her a lemon.\n\nAfter this we never tell family or friends when we sell our  cars.

Anyway, off it went, w/ the title, to its new home. About 4 weeks later, there it sits in our neighbor's driveway and the friend was waiting to ask us for money to repair something on our van.
