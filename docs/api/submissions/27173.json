Should've just let her make the food in the oven and suffer the wrath of a poorly-baked potato instead of lying to her about something she's clearly upset about.", "Well, you should have sent that \"customer\" away. She's probably a full blown conspiracy theorist and lost contact with the world.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTDIL there is a conspiracy that thinks microwaves causes alzheimer", "Oh, no, we're all damned.  I'm surprised that the whole world doesn't have Alzheimer's.\n\nOn a serious note.  I would have just left the potato and give it back to her raw in 10 minutes.  I'd be too lazy to help her out in that aspect.\n\nEdited to add.  NTA  You were trying to help.  She's just a pain the arse.", "NTA. \n\nDoes she listen to a radio?  That\u2019s a form of [non-ionizing radiation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-ionizing_radiation) just like microwave ovens. Does she have a cellphone?  If so she\u2019s living in a cloud of RG radiation - also non-ionizing type.  \n\nShe\u2019s in bigger danger from the aluminum she wraps around her potato.", "YTA. It doesn't matter if you agree with her or not, she didn't want it microwaved. You should have just said \"no, sorry, you're gonna have to take it home to bake it\". Also it's pretty obvious when a \"baked\" potato has been microwave vs. cooked in an oven. When they are microwaved they don't get that nice crisp skin like you get with the oven.", "What if she left the oven on and op was blamed for it?

However, I am well aware that many kitchens have one and when I eat out some of the food may have been in a microwave for whatever reason.   \nMy inlaws will use a microwave to cook the frozen corn and peas and I'll still eat it. Whether microwaves cause Alzheimer's, I don't know. \n\nI think the only reason YTA is because you \"tampered\" with someone's food, regardless of you trying to help. Though, I think this person would have cracked the shits had you just left it in the oven and she would have complained about the fact that her potato was not cooked.", "YTA.

Should\u2019ve not touched her potato at all. Instead you not only went against what she asked but also tried to hide it.", "YTA, just mind your business", "YTA. You decided to take it upon yourself to prepare her food in the exact way she clearly stated she didn't want it cooked. It doesn't matter her reasons. You violated her wishes for NO REASON. You don't tamper with other people's food.\n\nYTA.", "NTA but also next time just let her have her raw potato and turn the oven off", "NTA, Just tell her your sorry she didn't plan ahead but the oven is off and going to stay that way. She can use the microwave or go hungry it's up to her.\n\nMicrowaves do not cause Alzheimer's.", "YTA for the sake of naming someone in the situation. I would say you should have just minded your own business and let them be. We don't know how strong people react to some things, so it's best never to help someone without their permission in most cases. You could have just let them figure it out themselves, may have served as a lesson-learning moment.\n\n Your intentions are in the right place, but just let your coworker be. If they want to think microwaves are unhealthy, you forcing their potato into it won't convince them otherwise. Instead they will be angry, as you just found out.", "Mess with my food\u2026get stabbed with a fork.", "ESH\n\nShe's ignorant and overreacted. But don't mess with people's food against their knowledge, even with good intentions. The proper approach would be to let her have her poorly cooked potato - or, if her access is truly dependent on you, just tell her there isn't time to cook it and don't let her use the kitchen.", "There's that good deed not going unpunished again.  You should have let her take her raw potato home with her.\n\nEasy solution--she's not supposed to be back there anyway, so start enforcing that.", "ESH\n\nShe's clueless, but you shouldn't have put it in the 'wave. I know you were trying to help, but you can't help crazy. Just let her have a raw potato next time.", "YTA. Don\u2019t mess with peoples food, ever, under any circumstance. Either tell her it\u2019s too late and the kitchen is closed for the night, or tell her she can use the oven for 10 minutes only and that you are not staying late for her. Don\u2019t do the one exact thing she told you she was uncomfortable with, regardless of whether or not you agree with her reasons.", "YTA.\n\nShe found out bc a baked potato has a different texture than a microwaved potato. Microwaved potatos are gross. Baked potatoes are heaven. \n\nHer alzheimers theory is clearly bananas, but that's no reason to subject someone seeking a baked potato to the wrongness of a microwaved potato.", "YTA, but only because I'd be more worried about you handling my food.", "*She told me microwaving food causes Alzheimer's.....the next day when she came up to me and started yelling.....She basically cussed me out*\n\nBoy, that was quick.  One microwaved potato and it sounds like she is already in the beginning stages of Alzheimer's.", "YTA. A microwaved baked potato looks and cooks different than an oven baked potato. That\u2019s probably how she knew. Also it takes way longer to cook in an oven, so she was probably aware of that too. Next time, MYOB.", "ESH\n\ndo NOT let her use the kitchen again. If she's not supposed to be there for whatever reason, you allowing her to use the equipment WILL get you in trouble if she's injured or damages anything there.", "50/50 - As someone with food allergies, if someone says they do not want something in thier food or don't want it cooked a certain way then you simply do not do it. You should have just said no. Baked potatoes take 45 mins at at least 400 degrees. You had 10 minutes, You should have just said no.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
