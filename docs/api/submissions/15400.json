They have been dating for almost 3 years now and got engaged a couple of months ago. My brother is a widower and he has my 11 year old nephew and my 8 year old nephew with his late wife. The boys do not like Rebecca and are so unhappy that my brother is dating again and got engaged. Rebecca is aware that they are not super happy with her presence, but my brother has been lying to her about him helping them. He lied and told her the boys were in therapy after their mom died and he cut it short then because he couldn't afford it but is now investing into that so they can move forward healthily. But those boys have never been in any kind of therapy and are not currently going. \n\nRebecca is excited to be part of the family and to get to know the boys better and grow closer to them. She has stated the wedding is on hold for a while until the boys have had more time with their therapist. I can see it in her she is SO excited though and really wants a close relationship with them and she wants to have kids with my brother in the future.\n\nA few days ago my brother was telling the boys they should come shopping with him to get something for Rebecca's birthday. The boys said no and my brother tried to force it and the boys reaction was fuck Rebecca, she's nothing to us. He said she's going to be their mom soon and the mom of their future siblings. My oldest nephew made it very clear that he'll only ever have one sibling and he doesn't care if a baby is born tomorrow because he would not treat them like he treats his brother and would not love them. My younger nephew said he'd want to live with his uncle, who is his mom's brother, if they had a baby and would not want to meet the baby. My brother argued with them but they said there is no way they would want his family without their mom.\n\nMy older nephew told me right after that how sad he is that he can't just go live with his mom and how it's not fair that she's gone and how Rebecca is dumb for thinking she'd be their mom. I asked why he felt like that's what she was trying to do and he told me his dad said so many times. After that I realized I should warn Rebecca. I didn't say anything to my brother because he is stubborn like mom and has rejected my many suggestions the boys should get grief therapy (which I said right after their mom died).\n\nI called and asked to speak to her and when we caught up for coffee I told her not to marry my brother. She was shocked. I told her everything and I told her she deserved so much better than the lies and the false expectations that they could be a happy family eventually. I told her what my brother was telling the boys and that he never had them in any kind of therapy. She was so upset to hear he'd been putting the boys through all that.\n\nMy brother is pissed I told her not to marry him. He raged at me on the phone because of it.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682145782, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12uxgct/aita_for_telling_my_brothers_fiancee_she_shouldnt/", "score": 175, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No money for kids\u2019 therapy  but he has money to date and marry. Jeez.", "NTA, that poor girl dodged a major bullet thanks to you.\n\nShe deserves so much better and the kids deserve so much better than your brother.\n\nSincerely requesting OP to somehow put those kids in therapy because they really need it, the amount of mental trauma they're experiencing right now is not good for their mental health at all.\n\nDon't listen to your brother that guys a MAH", "NTA.

Your brother is a complete asshole. He was setting her and the boys up for a complete, miserable failure of a marriage. She deserved to know exactly what she was walking into.", "NTA\u2014 your brother is selling her a false reality and just being expedient to try keep her in his life. It\u2019s good of you to tell her the truth.", "NTA, the only asshole here is your brother. Good on you for getting Rebecca out of that potentially tight spot, now you'd want to try to help out the boys in whichever way you can. If you can't legally get therapy for them, maybe you can reach out to a school counsellor just in case, maybe that would help.", "NTA she was going to find out at some point. It\u2019s better she found out now. The brother wasn\u2019t handling it properly and you saved that girl a world of hurt down the line.", "NTA- Rebecca needed to see what kind of father your brother truly is before she ties herself to him forever with a kid. \n\nI feel bad for your nephews as I\u2019m pretty sure your brother will treat them even more repulsive now that Rebecca knows the truth .", "Please continue to talk with your nephews and make sure they know that they can talk to you at any time and about anything. \n\nIt seems like you already have a great relationship with them and I hope you will remain close to them as they get older. \n\nNTA", "NTA, maybe this will make your brother step up now and get his children some help coping with their mother's death, instead of shoving his girlfriend down their throats to replace their mother. He has no business in a relationship when he can't even parent and just lies instead. Somebody had to put an end to the madness. Three years is a long time for this to be going on. He needs help. Too bad he wasn't honest, because it sounds like his girlfriend would have helped get some help for the children all this time, smh.", "NTA\n\nYour brother was leading Rebecca on.  How long did he think they were going to stay married because it wasn't going to take long to realise he had been lying to her.\n\nIt also suggests that she hasn't spent much time with the boys to build any sort of relationship.  And that was planned.\n\nYou've done her a massive favour.  And also your brother and nephews.  Even if they don't see it this way.", "NTA.\n\nIs there anyway the kid's mother's family could get some kind of custody of them ? Because your borther sounds like a shitty parent.", "NTA - the right choice!!\n\nHonestly I am a little shocked by the amount of anger in your nephews - yes grief absolutely includes anger, absolutely! And it's not unusual for kids in their position to feel resentment and anger. But for them to so thoroughly hate her, more than they worry about their dad, is not entirely standard and they definitely need help. You generally see kids at some point realizing they don't want their remaining parent to be alone and miserable - the fact that they don't feel that at all to me says this isn't \"just\" grief, it's also mismanagement on your brother's part - not that being a widower is easy. He needs help, too, is what I'm saying.\n\nRebecca deserves more effort than this. Good on you.", "YTA.  Helping bring the truth to light for her is a nice thing to do, but telling her not to marry him is a step too far.  For one, it really is none of your business what two other people do with their lives, even if one of them is family.  Secondly, unless he's abusing his kids, what he does with them is also none of your business.\n\nYou can give advice, and suggestions, sure, because you love them, but trying to be a moral arbiter and director of their lives is crossing the line.  I think it's a good thing revealing all this to her, helping her have the information, but you should allow her to make her own decision with the information.", "NTA. \nYou brother is an AH. \nYour nephews are AHs.", "ESH except Rebecca. You are okay for telling her what you knew Tyne the truth. Telling her not to marry him is kinda too much.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Blending a family based on lies and false pretenses is impossible. FWIW, what your brother was doing comes off as entrapment. It was extremely selfish.

Those boys need to have someone to talk to about their grief and feelings about their dad and dating Rebecca or anyone for that matter. They\u2019ve been dating for three years, starting when those boys were pretty young and they still have refused to accept her in all that time.  Your brother won\u2019t have a healthy relationship until he works things out with his kids first. \n\nYou did a good thing, it would have done everyone harm for her to go into a marriage being lied to about something this important.", "How do you know they never had any therapy?", "NTA. I think you handled this really well. It's a shame because if your brother had approached this differently, given how Rebecca is (she sounds reasonable), there's a good chance she and the boys would have had a friendly relationship.", "The family is somewhat divided. My mom will always side with my brother and that's just a fact. They are too alike for that not to happen. But my other brother has tried just as hard to get through to him and failed and so doesn't think I did wrong. I think dad would have agreed with me too but he's not with us anymore, sadly.

None of this is even remotely something that would get the kids taken from him in any way. They do see their maternal family so that's one positive. Though I have asked myself before if my brother would try to end that. Then they could make a case for grandparents rights but not while they still see the boys.", "I think the anger makes sense when my brother has told them she'll be their new mom. That alone will bring the anger out and mix the grief in alongside that and you've got something that will end badly if pushed.", "It sounds like she and Rebecca have established a friendship and OP was looking out for her just like any decent friend would do. Brother or not, OP didn\u2019t want to put this poor woman through this misery and disappointment through her brothers lies and manipulations to later see another poor woman find herself stuck in a vulnerable situation and she didn\u2019t want to stand by and watch it happen.

Yah sorry, your bro is a short sited moron. It's ok, we all have one in the family.

While as an aunt there isn't much you can do, the school can do some things to help them.", "You may not be able to take them to therapy but you can be a 'trusted safe adult' in their life.  If your brother allows it (maybe after the dust settles) see if you can do auntie/nephew outings and just build that relationship so they know they can talk to you.\n\nAlso NTA.  Normally I'm in the camp of don't mess in other's relationships unless dangerous (ie: abuse situations).  This may or may not quite wander into the abuse realm but it's quite bad for those two boys.

As I mentioned, I think that telling her specifically what to do is crossing a line, but making her aware of the truth and looking out for her is a decent thing to do.", "While this is true, it isn't OP's marriage, and the marriage of two other people is none of his business.", "American schools don't have real counselors anymore... they are just glorified schedule clerks.", "I hear you on that! Poor things.\n\nObviously OPs brother has the right to move on with his life and to remarry but he's being an AH in how he handles his kids feelings, and he's making a really bad mess of it if they still feel so strongly 3 years+ after their mother passed.

Do you have any realistic and feasible suggestions?", "Pucky. \n\nOP's brother is setting up his fiancee for an abusive arrangement: the entire damn family (his village, after all) should be condemning his behaviour and warning her not to marry him. \n\nAfter she's fully informed, she can still decide it's worth it to her and marry him with her eyes wide open, if she wishes.", "Fiddlesticks and flapdoodle. If a friend of mine was stuck in an abusive marriage/relationship and was clearly heading for trouble I would do all I could to support them and help them find a way out.

I think I might have missed that.", "This is not enough for that to be able to happen. The boys aren't being parented great and their emotional needs aren't being taken care of. But that doesn't mean someone could take custody off my brother.", "How? You can\u2019t just grab and go with kids who are being poorly parented.", "Does changing it to \"bull-pucky\" give you the clue?", "A lie continued for years is abuse.", "Ever heard the term \u2018abuse of trust\u2019? This is the definition of that. Rebecca is being fed the narrative that everything is being handled, alls fine and dandy, the kids are all in therapy. She\u2019s being set up and she was bouncing into this like a friggin golden lab playing in the yard. OPs brother was looking out for himself by abusing her trust.", "To develop properly, a child needs 30% of their emotional needs taken care of. 30. Percent! Do you know how low the bar is for that? If he can't even take care of 30% of their emotional needs, he shouldn't be a parent. Your nephews might grow up fine but emotionally and mentally? No. I'm sorry, but they aren't going to be fine if he doesn't STEP UP AND BE A FATHER.\n\nMy emotional needs weren't met as a child and oh boy. Support systems made of STEEL were needed.", "Now now, no need to be uncivilized.", "You and the law have different definitions of abuse, then.", "I've never heard that term before to refer to a person being abused, that just sounds like literally anyone telling anyone a lie, so I hesitate to really call that 'abuse'.  And, if you would kindly read what I initially said, I pointed out that informing the bride-to-be of the truth was just fine, but it's the TELLING HER WHAT SHE SHOULD DO that crosses the line.\n\nI swear, people stop reading halfway through.", "Oh, it's so important but often the emotional stuff is brushed away and overlooked and nothing will be done about it.", "You're not wrong.  But, courts just aren't going to take kids away based just on the lack of grief counseling or therapy.  Sorry.", "No, we read it. I simply responded to you asking how she is being abused.", "It's so frustrating that mental and emotional stuff ain't noticed! Hell, some kids have no toys and a barebones bedroom while living in rot and their parents are definitely not yet they are somehow kept with said parents", "Add to that, she\u2019s been given a pack of lies before they\u2019re even married. She\u2019s being sold a lemon.

Not yet. Thanks to OP she now has the full story nice and clear, so she can make her choice with all of the facts.", "NTA someone needs to put the kids mental well-being first & your brother is making things worse not better. Rebecca needs to demand family counseling if she wants to marry your brother. Maybe it will help him see how important it is. He can\u2019t continue to disregard his children\u2019s needs because he wants to pretend there is no problem. What he is doing by lying is absolutely evil and marriage started on a bed of lies will never succeed.", "NTA Your brother is selfish. You did the right thing by telling the truth.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nRebecca needed to know the truth.

He is trying to force this new family scenario on them and ignoring their feelings.  I think part of it may be that he hasn't dealt with his own grief for the loss of his wife.  Being a single parent is tough, and trying to deal with a loss at the same time is rough too.  He needs help, doesn't want to admit that, is hoping to force through this new mom thing with this poor lady that doesn't see the whole picture.   I think she'd try to help the kids more than your brother.  But they won't open up to her based on their father's approach.  What a heartbreaking situation.", "Honestly I think you did the right thing.\n\nI feel like Rebecca wouldn't force herself on the kids but your brother has lied so much to her she thought everything was OK\n\nYou're a good person for not only protecting your nephews but also Rebecca (who seems quite nice) from all the crap your brother is bringing out\n\nNTA \n\nWhat a crap situation your brother has made for for you all :(", "Depends on the school. In high school, yes, their primary job is scheduling, but elementary school counselors will do some counseling. It's generally about making sure the child is doing well in school (so things like social skills, study skills, conflict resolution), but they can refer the kids to a therapist if they think there is a bigger problem. That's if the school can even afford a counselor in the elementary school."]}
