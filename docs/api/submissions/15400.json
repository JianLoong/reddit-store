They have been dating for almost 3 years now and got engaged a couple of months ago. My brother is a widower and he has my 11 year old nephew and my 8 year old nephew with his late wife. The boys do not like Rebecca and are so unhappy that my brother is dating again and got engaged. Rebecca is aware that they are not super happy with her presence, but my brother has been lying to her about him helping them. He lied and told her the boys were in therapy after their mom died and he cut it short then because he couldn't afford it but is now investing into that so they can move forward healthily. But those boys have never been in any kind of therapy and are not currently going. \n\nRebecca is excited to be part of the family and to get to know the boys better and grow closer to them. She has stated the wedding is on hold for a while until the boys have had more time with their therapist. I can see it in her she is SO excited though and really wants a close relationship with them and she wants to have kids with my brother in the future.\n\nA few days ago my brother was telling the boys they should come shopping with him to get something for Rebecca's birthday. The boys said no and my brother tried to force it and the boys reaction was fuck Rebecca, she's nothing to us. He said she's going to be their mom soon and the mom of their future siblings. My oldest nephew made it very clear that he'll only ever have one sibling and he doesn't care if a baby is born tomorrow because he would not treat them like he treats his brother and would not love them. My younger nephew said he'd want to live with his uncle, who is his mom's brother, if they had a baby and would not want to meet the baby. My brother argued with them but they said there is no way they would want his family without their mom.\n\nMy older nephew told me right after that how sad he is that he can't just go live with his mom and how it's not fair that she's gone and how Rebecca is dumb for thinking she'd be their mom. I asked why he felt like that's what she was trying to do and he told me his dad said so many times. After that I realized I should warn Rebecca. I didn't say anything to my brother because he is stubborn like mom and has rejected my many suggestions the boys should get grief therapy (which I said right after their mom died).\n\nI called and asked to speak to her and when we caught up for coffee I told her not to marry my brother. She was shocked. I told her everything and I told her she deserved so much better than the lies and the false expectations that they could be a happy family eventually. I told her what my brother was telling the boys and that he never had them in any kind of therapy. She was so upset to hear he'd been putting the boys through all that.\n\nMy brother is pissed I told her not to marry him. He raged at me on the phone because of it.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682145782, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12uxgct/aita_for_telling_my_brothers_fiancee_she_shouldnt/", "score": 747, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You generally see kids at some point realizing they don't want their remaining parent to be alone and miserable - the fact that they don't feel that at all to me says this isn't \"just\" grief, it's also mismanagement on your brother's part - not that being a widower is easy.

Secondly, unless he's abusing his kids, what he does with them is also none of your business.\n\nYou can give advice, and suggestions, sure, because you love them, but trying to be a moral arbiter and director of their lives is crossing the line.

I get he loves Rebecca and wants to be happy and move on with her and that's good for him. But it's not OK for him to try and push his kids into liking her to make his life easier.

On the way, you also helped Rebecca dodge a bullet.", "NTA.  You were kind to Rebecca.  Having her build a life on lies would not have been kind or loving.", "NTA. Your brother is awful doing this to both Rebecca and to his kids\u2014selfish to the fullest degree. If they got married his kids would continue to loathe her and it would tear them all apart; that marriage wouldn\u2019t have lasted. Your brother is the one who needs therapy if he thinks it\u2019s okay to lie and manipulate his traumatized kids and fiancee like that", "OOOOH this is a toughie.  I'm sort of in your brothers place.  My wife died shortly after our youngest daughter was born.  Now the girls are 3 and almost 6.  Neither of course remember their mom although they have photos.  My problem is my mom/sister are constantly telling me that men can't raise girls even though I'm doing pretty darn good according to others I trust.  If my girls were against me getting remarried it would be really difficult to go through with it.  My girls are more important than someone coming into our lives.  \n\nI understand the boys reaction, a second wife/husband can't take the place of their mom/dad and anyone saying, 'I want to be your mom' isn't going to do it.  I've asked my girls what they would do if I wanted to get married, of course my 3 year old doesn't care and my 5/6 year old says if she's nice and gets to wear a pretty dress at the wedding she's good with it.  Of course that's what I'd expect from a little one.  But I don't even date and haven't since my wife died, I'm way to busy...  but, you are NTAH for telling the fiance not to marry your brother.  I would think she'd rather know now than get ambushed after the wedding and end up divorced which would be way worse.  Again, NTAH.", "The ager is totally to be expected in this situation and completely normal. These kids have had their mother taken away from them and are grieving for her. Then they are basically being told by their dad, the person they trust the most, that they should effectively get over that grief and welcome a new mum and love her like they loved their mother. That may not be how you think it sounds but if you were a child who's lost your mother then it probably does.", "You did what you had to for the kids. Your brother was just ignoring their desires and lying to his fiance. \n\nIf the truth makes her leave, that's on him not you or her.", "Because you are implying judgment if she chooses a different path. I am suggesting that giving someone the facts and sharing your concerns for the outcome is generally a better path than telling someone which choice to make. OP can even establish boundaries of what they will participate in, but it is not good communication. If Rebecca asks OP for advice, that is when they can say - Run far away from this situation!!!", "neither does the dog. \ud83d\ude21", "No, she was correct to warn her against marrying him. Why would you want to marry someone who has been constantly lying to you? Why would you want to continue to force yourself into this family's life knowing that 2/3 of them just about despise you? Why would you want to be with someone who shows he does not care about what his kids need? \n\nShe should be HEAVILY rethinking any form of relationship with a man who shows he can be sneaky and manipulative to get what he wants.", "This. Best thing OP can do for now: build a relationship with those kids where they feel comfortable telling her *anything*. Make it clear they can say *anything* to Auntie OP, and she won't tell Dad. Don't underestimate how bad kids can need someone like that, in their situation.", "Yta and get your head out of others relationships", "[removed]", "NTA... your brother is a liar and a deceptive manipulator.  Rebecca deserves so much better. She needs to run and your brother needs therapy as much as the boys do. Wow", "Your brother has mis-handled everything from his children to his lies to his current partner. What a mess. NTA The GF needs to know the truth.", "NTA. You did the right thing by Rebecca and your nephews. Your brother is living in a toxic fantasyland and nothing healthy will come from it.\n\nAs an aside, sometimes therapy is a lot more affordable and accessible than people are led to believe. In some states it's simple to get primary or secondary Medicaid coverage for children based on household finances and health. The kids PCP or school counselor may be able to provide a referral, the health insurance member services line can give you a list of in network providers or in some cases get a care manager to make calls for you, some jobs have free and confidential employee assistance plans that would make calls as well. Sites like psychology today dot com are great resources as well. As a relative you may not be able to schedule appointments for your nephews, but you can definitely make calls and acquire information about availability and cost.", "Sometimes doing the right thing means hurting someone close to you. Rebecca was walking into a lie and a fairy tale and, at least, deserved to be warned about it. Your brother is both a terrible father, and boyfriend, for trying to force this change in everyone. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. You made the right call not just for Rebecca, but for your nephews, too. Your brother\u2019s lies would have ruined all of their lives.", "NTA\n\nHuman life is like currency. We only have so much to spend. Your brother is taking the lives of his fiancee and children like they're his own to use and spending them on lies, deception, and what is obvious to be years of horrible relationships. He's happy to waste their lives for his happiness and is doing whatever he can to get what he wants.\n\nNo one deserves to have their marriage begin with deception. No child deserves a step parent that's been deceived into thinking that they were wanted.\n\nDivorce and grief eat at a person. Fiancee could have years of issues if she married and had to divorce your brother. Or, was he thinking that marriage would chain her and that she'd deal with it?\n\nAnd, again, the children. Abuse and stress have been shown to harm physical, emotional, and mental development. These things can actively hurt a child. It's not uncommon knowledge. The marriage could negatively affect how they grow up.", "NTA. You already know that your brother is failing his kids by not getting them the therapy they need. Adding another layer of emotional manipulation onto them would be even more damaging. As hurtful as it was for Rebecca, you did her a favor by telling her the truth. Of course your brother is angry, but his deception was his choice. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re bearing the brunt of his anger but you did the right thing.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Guidance and adjustment counselors are different professions and all high schools in my area have both. \n\nMiddle and elementary schools have adjustment counselors and no guidance counselors. \n\nMay not be the same in your area, but adjustment counselors here have to have social work or mental health clinician licensure in my state through those boards plus school specific licensing through the DOE. Guidance counselors have DOE licensing but do not have to be credentialed as social workers or mental health clinicians. \n\nThey are not vaguely the same professions.", "Even if the school do refer the children for therapy, that still would be up to OP's brother to follow thru.  And so far, it looks like it won't happen if going by his lying to his Fiancee about kids already being in therapy.", "Yeah, this dad sucks and sending the kids to a school counselor probably won't help. They're not therapists, they're there to help with school-related problems. Unless the kids' contempt for the fiancee is affecting their grades or classroom behavior (which it probably isn't), there's not much a school counselor can do.\n\nI was just responding to the previous commenter who was saying school counselors are nothing but glorified schedulers... That's not always true for younger grades, and almost certainly depends on the quality of the school district.", "This whole story is wild. Why aren't the kids just happy their dad has someone? Was mom's passing recent?", "NTA. You did the right thing. Your brother is an insensitive compulsive liar that isn't a good parent. I hope those kids get help.", "NTA. I would want to know. In fact my ex fianc\u00e9 and I broke up last year. I learned about a year before that his daughter and a couple friends of his did not like me early on, they told him not to date me etc., and they didn't even know me! I had been nothing but nice to them, not sure why they formed that opinion I am usually pretty agreeable. Anyhow I digress, my point is if I had had this knowledge early on, (the relationship lasted seven years) I would've handled and approached things quite differently. He put me in situations and at events where I had no idea. I would always rather know the truth, even if it's hurtful.", "Why on earth is he avoiding therapy for the boys?", "Genuinely a great move on your part. If your brother really wants a relationship with her, she has ammunition for an ultimatum: therapy for the boys, with a receipt. \n\nAnd who knows? Maybe her holding his feet to the fire might actually be a moment to bond with the boys\u2013 seeing that Rebecca is taking them seriously enough to not force herself into their lives. It could end up being the best thing for all of them. Maybe.\n\nNTA.", "Unpopular opinion, it wasn\u2019t your business. Everyone on here saying that your brother should have chose his children\u2019s happiness over his own is crazy. children have nothing to do with people getting married. your brother was entitled to marry if he wanted to.  know just because the kids wasn\u2019t going to accept her emotionally doesn\u2019t mean you had to meddle in his relationship", "NTA, but she may still marry him.", "My daughter got lucky with the school she send her daughter (my granddaughter to).  Granddaughter is in the second grade but reads and spell at the 4-5 grade level and her math is at third grade level.  The problem is she can't comprehend what she read.  The school called in a therapist with my  daughter's permission and now granddaughter is getting specialized tutoring through the school."]}
