{"id": 26599, "submission_id": "16ezs4l", "title": "AITA for going to disneyworld without my boyfriend?", "selftext": "I (23F) was invited to go to Disney World by my friend\u2019s boyfriend, because yesterday he proposed to him and part of the engagement surprise is flying us down there to meet them on their trip! I\u2019ve never been to Disney World or even Florida before, so this is really exciting for me! One catch is I cannot bring my boyfriend because my park tickets and flight were paid for by my friend\u2019s boyfriend and my friend\u2019s mom took care of the hotel we\u2019re staying at. Basically, I paid for nothing and I\u2019m just here to celebrate my friend\u2019s engagement! Which is great because I do not have the money to spend on a trip to DisneyWorld right now. My boyfriend (30M), at first was mad that I was going to Disney without him because \u201che wanted to be the first one to take me\u201d. I said I was sorry, but I cannot miss my friend\u2019s engagement celebration, we\u2019ve been friends for a decade and everything was already paid for. I\u2019d only be gone from Wednesday to Saturday too. He sulked around about it, but eventually it seemed like he was okay with it. \n\nFast forward to yesterday, three days before I\u2019m supposed to leave, and one of my friend that I\u2019m supposed to be leaving to go to Disney with came over my house to see a Babymetal concert with me. Naturally, we start talking about all of the things we\u2019re going to do during our trip. Then, she randomly asks, \u201cHey, do you want to go to Rainforest Cafe with me while we\u2019re there?\u201d. My eyes literally lit up. I\u2019ve been talking about going to Rainforest Cafe with my boyfriend and friends off handily for about a year now. Not because it\u2019s a special place in my heart (I\u2019ve only been there like twice in my childhood), but because I thought it\u2019d be funny. So when she asked me to go, of course I said \u201coh absolutely!\u201d because I was thinking I could go with my friend and then also go with my boyfriend when we could afford to go and it\u2019d be two separate experiences and it\u2019d be fine. \n\nMy boyfriend got mad at me again. \n\n\u201cThis is the second thing you\u2019re doing without me that I wanted to take you to experience for the first time\u201d, he said. He said he planned on *one day* taking me to the Rainforest Cafe in Niagara Falls. \n\nI understand where he\u2019s coming from, but I can\u2019t understand why he\u2019s so upset at me for going. I find that the two experiences could be separate, but equal. Like yes, you can\u2019t experience these things as a first time experience with me right now, but we can go *together* and experience it *for the first time together*, which I think is more special. I don\u2019t know, does he expect me not to go? It just makes me feel guilty for going. \n\nSo AITA for going to DisneyWorld and Rainforest Cafe without my boyfriend?\n\nEDIT: thank you guys for the responses! but there are a few things i want to address. first, the few things i post on reddit sparingly does not reflect all of the good times we have\n\nsecond, i understand why anyone can be frustrated that they are not going to disneyworld with their spouse, i\u2019ve never been but it seems like it could be romantic! \n\nthird, i did not pick the place where my friend and his new fianc\u00e9 are celebrating their engagement.. disneyworld is what they chose i was just invited \n\nagain, thank you all for your input and i\u2019ll be talking to my boyfriend about his feelings as well as mine once we\u2019ve both calmed down", "created_utc": 1694350989, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ezs4l/aita_for_going_to_disneyworld_without_my_boyfriend/", "score": 156, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Anyone who, like your boyfriend, asks/tells their partner to deny themselves opportunities because they (the boyfriend) cannot share in the experiences is about as far away from love as I can think.", "NTA. Your current bf's \"one day\" stories are easy to say, but he's had a chance to take you to Disney or Rainforest Cafe and hasn't done either. He's 30 and whining like a toddler. What's his obsession with being \"your first\" anyway?", "NTA\n\nYou are an adult.  Go where you want.  He's not your spouse, he's not your intended. He is however much older, and given he wants to control you this much- that you can't even go to a restaurant so he can 'show you', that's concerning.

Go and celebrate like a good friend.", "If he's 30 years old and can't afford to take you to rainforest Cafe for dinner please don't waste your time with him. NTA.", "NTA.

Well, he hasn't, and quite frankly, it's all striking me as so much bullshit on his part. For whatever stupidly insecure reason, he doesn't want you to go alone.\n\nYou were invited and paid for. He was not. Simple as that. You don't have to be attached at the hip. Couples can and do go on trips separately.

I doubt he even planned to take you to Disney or Rainforest, or any other places- he just wanted to guilt you into not going. Had he even brought up taking you to any of these places before? Has he discussed taking you to other places? \n\nHe has no right guilting you over a Disney trip that was not about him and did not concern him. He was not invited or accommodated for. \n\nYou are SUPPOSED to have your own experiences and interests. You can enjoy things with and without a boyfriend.  He should be happy you have these opportunities, not make you feel guilty.\n\nYour relationship is not a healthy one. If you let him have his way, you\u2019ll turn down opportunities with friends (and eventually find yourself isolated and friendless) because he\u2019ll have you convinced he\u2019ll want to take you. Then it\u2019ll turn into you waiting forever for him to get around to it. He\u2019s full of human waste and empty promises. All to keep you under his control.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why a 30 year old guy is with a much younger woman- because women his age won\u2019t put up with his nonsense, and your limited life and relationship experience prevents you from knowing better. Dump him so you can have your life back, guilt-free. I\u2019m willing to bet  once you have time and distance from him, you\u2019ll look back and see all the red flags you missed.", "NTA, sounds kind of immature for a 30 year old but I realize it's based on just a post. I guess it doesn't matter either way because you need to have fun and enjoy yourself!", "Red flags everywhere. First, the age gap; second, how he\u2019s getting mad at you for celebrating your friend\u2019s engagement; and third, how he\u2019s emotionally blackmailing you because \u201che wanted to take you first\u201d.

Go on your trip and while you\u2019re having fun, take some time to consider if you might need a new boyfriend.", "NTA. Your bf displays more red flags than a California beach during a shark watch. He is basically saying he is not ok with you having any type of fun unless it is either with him or because of him. Run for the hills - and don't look back.", "I'm going slightly against the trend here. NTA, but... My wife travels a lot and will vacation without me. I'm cool with that because I don't like to travel as much and she has a great time with friends, family or even by herself. \n\nThe only downside is that when we plan vacations together, she has been a lot of places already that I haven't been to yet.  She is all about going to see them again, but I don't want to go to them because I want to experience new things with her together, not have her be my tourist guide.  It's just a little different feeling when your both hiking Banff for the first time together and taking in the amazing beauty together vs one of you going look at this, this is cool, you should see it too.

If your boyfriend wants to take you there he should.", " why do you keep changing the ages on your post?", "**NAH** \\- You have done absolutely nothing wrong.  Your BF is disappointed that he will not be with you when you first experience these things.  That is a normal reaction and does not make him an asshole either.

You express that you want to create memories with them. Instead of them wanting to create memories with you they go off their own with other people.
