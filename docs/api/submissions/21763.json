I'm not an expert on solving addiction, but this is maybe a discussion you should be having with his dad? Or maybe finding some sort of professional to consult on best practice.

It affects every part of your life, mind and body both. Take him to a doctor and get him on a nicotine patch or some other treatment that will allow him to wean off slowly. Find a doctor who will explain to him why it's so important to quit now. You're just punishing him for breaking \"house rules\" without realizing how it's affecting him.", "YTA and I do not understand the folks going the other way. Yes it\u2019s her home so it would normally be her rules. But she has a child she only sees 3 months a year and she knows the child has anxiety-related tics.  What isn\u2019t being discussed is whether or not that child with anxiety-related tics has other coping strategies should she take the cigarettes away. Does she even know the answer to that question. Also, if this kid has poor coping strategies, why would she set him up to fail by simply tossing his cigarettes?\n\nSecond reason, YTA is that you simply dismiss the degree to which your child has become addicted to a drug that has physical side effects for quitting. You offer no strategy for helping this kid truly withdraw successfully from his addiction to a drug. Did I say that often enough? It\u2019s a drug and it\u2019s a hard one to kick. I would not be the only recovering addict/alcoholic to say that smoking cigarettes is the hardest thing I ever kicked.  \n\nYou\u2019re mad at someone, your kid was who took the brunt of your mad. Do better.", "Have you got him any actual help to quit or just thrown them away and expected that to work? Have you spoke to his father about what will happen when he goes back?", "YTA\n\nYou seem to be more focused on forcing him to obey rules, than actually worrying about his welfare. Nicotine withdrawal is seriously painful and many people struggle for years to quit. There's no reason you couldn't provide patches, gum or other aids to help him taper off. You also know he's smoking because of anxiety, but don't seem inclined to provide him any better way of coping with it via therapy, medication, or other lifestyle interventions. Without those supports there's zero chance he stops smoking for longer than he is physically at your home. In fact, you're deeply ingraining his dependence by making him feel as awful as possible without the cigarettes.\n\nThe entire approach seems more punitive than parental. If you want him to cope in better ways, do the work to help him find better ways.", "So I work for the AHA- obviously ending tobacco and vaping is a top priority. One thing we really try to focus on with schools is instead of punishing for vaping to get a cessation program together to help kids quit. Punishing them with detention or suspension won\u2019t fix the root of the problem.\n\nObviously NTA for making him quit. But you definitely need to go about this a better way. Just throwing out his cigarettes and essentially throwing him to the wolves is not the way to do it and a good way to push him away.\n\nSaying you\u2019re concerned about him being a \u201cbad influence\u201d on your younger children may make him feel like he\u2019s less important than they are, ESPECIALLY if he\u2019s dealing with anxiety.\n\nSmoking is likely something that helps him cope with his anxiety. I had really bad PPD and have horrible anxiety in general. I was smoking up until I was able to get treatment for it. It was the only way I could calm myself down. Just cutting him off without any sort of support makes you an AH. Nicotine is nightly addictive and hard to quit. It\u2019s why Big Tobacco continues to find ways to hook kids.\n\nTalk with your doctor on ways to help him quit and cope so he doesn\u2019t go off the deep end.\n\nDoes he get consistent mental healthcare? Is he on medication to help his anxiety? If the answer is no, he NEEDS a good therapist. Medicine isn\u2019t for everyone, but he at least needs a counselor to help him with his anxiety.\n\nHis father may not know he is smoking. Or if he does he may be afraid of what withdrawal and quitting will do to him. But you need to have a conversation with him and not be accusatory.\n\nLastly- discover some empathy for your child. He has been thrown into withdrawals against his will and it is going to mess with him. Be supportive of his struggles.", "I was in very situation when I was young, all that came of that was I hid it more and sneaked around more. Get him a vape, yah I get it you don't want him to smoke or use nicotine. But you go to be real with yourself, is taking the hard stance really going to help in the long run?", "throwing away someone's pack doesn't make them a non-smoker, no matter how much you (or they) might wish that was the case \n\n I COMPLETELY understand how nasty smoking is, especially to someone who hasn't ever been a smoker. and I can see how someone who has never been addicted to nicotine might have difficulty understanding just how AWFUL withdrawal is, and how intense it feels. and ofc, as a parent, OBVIOUSLY you care so so much about your child's well-being and happiness:) tossing his pack SEEMS like the best possible move \n\nbut - you haven't healed his addiction. if your son has taken up smoking at 16, he's *struggling* - you just kinda showed him that you aren't willing to show him grace, kindness, and empathy in his time of need. you're just going to bulldoze and make his decisions for him \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\na similar thing happened to me when I was young, and it made me determined to keep smoking because I was an angry young adult lol. important parts of the brain regarding decision-making aren't formed yet, u know? and CONTINUE SMOKING I DID! because I felt unsupported and unheard. I think that time of sneaking and being mad helped solidify my nicotine addiction but idk. finally stopped with the cigs after many years of them, but I still vape to this day\n\nI can't say for sure, but I wonder if my mom would have approached me like a concerned friend rather than a steamroller, I would have felt a little more cared-for and understood, and maybe I wouldn't have become a long-term slave to big tobacco. \n\nsoft YTA. there's no golden rulebook to parenting. I know you meant well", "i i\u2019m probably gonna get downvoted for this but i wouldn\u2019t make him stop smoking necessarily, especially if you want him to be honest with you. my parents tried to make me stop smoking and i did it behind their back. my mom ended up buying my cigarettes because she knew i\u2019d do it regardless after she caught me.", "Nta- I've smoked since I was a kid.

Cold turkey is the worst way of doing it.", "My dad quit smoking cold turkey and then promptly gained 70 pounds as he went from cigarettes to candy bars...cold turkey works for  quitting smoking, but some people just pick up another habit that's just as unhealthy \ud83d\ude26", "I would have never been able to quit without nicotine lozenges. Of course, they left a white powdery film on your lips. So, I had a reason to quit those as well once I was past the habits physical components. I tapered and it was super easy to stop using the lozenges, and it was easy to switch to cigarettes to lozenges because I went from light cigarettes to full strength lozenges which made smoking and adding more nicotine the absolute last thing I wanted to do. Seriously, those lozenges felt like cocaine-lite. It was against the recommendations. Those said I should have used the lower strength lozenges, but I really feel that the way I did it was why I succeeded. It is really easy to quit smoking when the idea of it even makes you feel slightly sick. Though I didn't mind the buzz, I did not want it to increase any further.", "This. As a former 5-pack-a-day smoker who finally quit cold turkey (30 years ago, when I was in treatment for another addiction), my biggest concern is that this is just one of his nervous tics. He needs support finding healthier coping skills. Origami was one of my crutches for dealing with fidgeting after I quit", "Yep. Cold turkey for a 16yo is the ONLY way to go. Anything slower is just an excuse for using it. Also an ex-smoker here.", "Just wanted to expand on this: Nicotine is definitely proven to be *harder* to quit than heroin. When it comes to withdrawal side effects, quitting heroin is decidedly more unpleasant.", "50?! Lmao, the kid\u2019s only going to get even more addicted to nicotine that way.", " If daddy can\u2019t prevent him from partaking in illegal health causing devices\u2026maybe the court needs to get involved.", "my mom ended up buying my cigarettes because she knew i\u2019d do it regardless after she caught me.", "Just curious - how much shit did you get in for that? Cause I'm pretty sure I would have been tossed in the lake as well if I did that. Potentially without my life jacket (was a shit swimmer)", "My mum has smoked 1, maybe 2 cigarettes a day for decades, but any time she tries to quit she just can\u2019t. She often doesn\u2019t smoke for days at a time without thinking, but quitting intentionally never works out. It\u2019s her only vice but she just can\u2019t shake it. My dad quit cold turkey 30 years ago and hasn\u2019t smoked since, but he loves a competition with himself. I think it depends a lot on personality type", ">Even my 95 yo aunt quit this way after smoking 40 cigs a day for 80!! Years.\n\nIs there really a reason to quit at that point?", "This comment is part of u/ThatBFjax below's comment, just only partially and cut off. Did I find a bot in action?", "Dude, 5 packs a day? I was a pack a day smoker for years, and on days of heavy drinking where I was outside in nice weather all day I'd manage 2. 5 packs a day is genuinely incredible lol. Were you just like literally chain smoking all day every day?", "\u201cGradual quitting\u201d and smoking don\u2019t go together.", "Seriously. I've quit cigs after a 30 yr habit and use 10mg nicotine salts. It's not even legal to sell strengths higher than 20mg where I live. \n\nOn the upside, at 50mg the poor kid might get so violently nic sick that he never looks at another cigarette or vape again", "That's just ridiculous", "Teenagers will literally always find a way. Unless you lock them in their room 24/7 they will find a way lol", "My thoughts but shes a 106 right now so i guess idk. Lol.\n\n\nBut she did it together with her great grandchild who was 17 and super hooked.", "> 5 packs a day is genuinely incredible\n\n*Lemmy Kilmister has entered the chat*", "In patient? Here we just get them the patch", "Have you guys considered you are just the pathetic weak links of society? Gradual quitting worked for me but I'm built different ig", "Watch out for that as well... because some teenagers will decide that 5heyve had enough, and no parent wants what comes after that.", "Wow! What a woman.", "You can get in patient rehab for nicotine (UK) but it certainty wont be provided on the NHS like outpatient help would be", "Yeah, no inpatient for nicotine in US. Moreover, you can't get inpatient treatment for marijuana use alone unless you have gotten in legal trouble because of it."]}
