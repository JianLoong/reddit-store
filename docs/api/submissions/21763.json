I'm not an expert on solving addiction, but this is maybe a discussion you should be having with his dad? Or maybe finding some sort of professional to consult on best practice.

It affects every part of your life, mind and body both. Take him to a doctor and get him on a nicotine patch or some other treatment that will allow him to wean off slowly. Find a doctor who will explain to him why it's so important to quit now. You're just punishing him for breaking \"house rules\" without realizing how it's affecting him.", "YTA and I do not understand the folks going the other way. Yes it\u2019s her home so it would normally be her rules. But she has a child she only sees 3 months a year and she knows the child has anxiety-related tics.  What isn\u2019t being discussed is whether or not that child with anxiety-related tics has other coping strategies should she take the cigarettes away. Does she even know the answer to that question. Also, if this kid has poor coping strategies, why would she set him up to fail by simply tossing his cigarettes?\n\nSecond reason, YTA is that you simply dismiss the degree to which your child has become addicted to a drug that has physical side effects for quitting. You offer no strategy for helping this kid truly withdraw successfully from his addiction to a drug. Did I say that often enough? It\u2019s a drug and it\u2019s a hard one to kick. I would not be the only recovering addict/alcoholic to say that smoking cigarettes is the hardest thing I ever kicked.  \n\nYou\u2019re mad at someone, your kid was who took the brunt of your mad. Do better.", "Have you got him any actual help to quit or just thrown them away and expected that to work? Have you spoke to his father about what will happen when he goes back?", "YTA\n\nYou seem to be more focused on forcing him to obey rules, than actually worrying about his welfare. Nicotine withdrawal is seriously painful and many people struggle for years to quit. There's no reason you couldn't provide patches, gum or other aids to help him taper off. You also know he's smoking because of anxiety, but don't seem inclined to provide him any better way of coping with it via therapy, medication, or other lifestyle interventions. Without those supports there's zero chance he stops smoking for longer than he is physically at your home. In fact, you're deeply ingraining his dependence by making him feel as awful as possible without the cigarettes.\n\nThe entire approach seems more punitive than parental. If you want him to cope in better ways, do the work to help him find better ways.", "So I work for the AHA- obviously ending tobacco and vaping is a top priority. One thing we really try to focus on with schools is instead of punishing for vaping to get a cessation program together to help kids quit. Punishing them with detention or suspension won\u2019t fix the root of the problem.\n\nObviously NTA for making him quit. But you definitely need to go about this a better way. Just throwing out his cigarettes and essentially throwing him to the wolves is not the way to do it and a good way to push him away.\n\nSaying you\u2019re concerned about him being a \u201cbad influence\u201d on your younger children may make him feel like he\u2019s less important than they are, ESPECIALLY if he\u2019s dealing with anxiety.\n\nSmoking is likely something that helps him cope with his anxiety. I had really bad PPD and have horrible anxiety in general. I was smoking up until I was able to get treatment for it. It was the only way I could calm myself down. Just cutting him off without any sort of support makes you an AH. Nicotine is nightly addictive and hard to quit. It\u2019s why Big Tobacco continues to find ways to hook kids.\n\nTalk with your doctor on ways to help him quit and cope so he doesn\u2019t go off the deep end.\n\nDoes he get consistent mental healthcare? Is he on medication to help his anxiety? If the answer is no, he NEEDS a good therapist. Medicine isn\u2019t for everyone, but he at least needs a counselor to help him with his anxiety.\n\nHis father may not know he is smoking. Or if he does he may be afraid of what withdrawal and quitting will do to him. But you need to have a conversation with him and not be accusatory.\n\nLastly- discover some empathy for your child. He has been thrown into withdrawals against his will and it is going to mess with him. Be supportive of his struggles.", "I was in very situation when I was young, all that came of that was I hid it more and sneaked around more. Get him a vape, yah I get it you don't want him to smoke or use nicotine. But you go to be real with yourself, is taking the hard stance really going to help in the long run?", "throwing away someone's pack doesn't make them a non-smoker, no matter how much you (or they) might wish that was the case \n\n I COMPLETELY understand how nasty smoking is, especially to someone who hasn't ever been a smoker. and I can see how someone who has never been addicted to nicotine might have difficulty understanding just how AWFUL withdrawal is, and how intense it feels. and ofc, as a parent, OBVIOUSLY you care so so much about your child's well-being and happiness:) tossing his pack SEEMS like the best possible move \n\nbut - you haven't healed his addiction. if your son has taken up smoking at 16, he's *struggling* - you just kinda showed him that you aren't willing to show him grace, kindness, and empathy in his time of need. you're just going to bulldoze and make his decisions for him \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\na similar thing happened to me when I was young, and it made me determined to keep smoking because I was an angry young adult lol. important parts of the brain regarding decision-making aren't formed yet, u know? and CONTINUE SMOKING I DID! because I felt unsupported and unheard. I think that time of sneaking and being mad helped solidify my nicotine addiction but idk. finally stopped with the cigs after many years of them, but I still vape to this day\n\nI can't say for sure, but I wonder if my mom would have approached me like a concerned friend rather than a steamroller, I would have felt a little more cared-for and understood, and maybe I wouldn't have become a long-term slave to big tobacco. \n\nsoft YTA. there's no golden rulebook to parenting. I know you meant well", "i i\u2019m probably gonna get downvoted for this but i wouldn\u2019t make him stop smoking necessarily, especially if you want him to be honest with you. my parents tried to make me stop smoking and i did it behind their back. my mom ended up buying my cigarettes because she knew i\u2019d do it regardless after she caught me.", "Nta- I've smoked since I was a kid.

While still not ideal, vaping avoids the tar etc in cigarettes. They also make it easier to wean down: you can get nicotine-free vapes for when you just need the motor movements of vaping, or you can mix juices if you have a box-mod to gradually lower the nicotine content until you only use nic-free juice. I know a few people who have switched to vaping and then reduced the nicotine content gradually; when they\u2019ve had a cigarette again socially, they found it disgusting (compared to the pleasant flavor of a vape), and one even told me cigarettes had way too much nicotine for him after transitioning to vaping \u2014 especially when he had a little in his system already from the vape.

The real benefit of vaping in this situation, though, is when he\u2019s back to living with his dad, it would be easier to be able to use a nic-free vape (trying to trick his brain into thinking he was smoking, and still getting that motor movement) than to resist entirely. \n\nCold-turkey with only a couple months with you isn\u2019t going to be enough for him to quit, and you\u2019ve set it up to be as miserable and upsetting for him as possible.

I found that cold turkey was the only way after a million failed attempts (smoker for a good 18 years).

Then you remember they\u2019re actually in the drawer and pick them up and feel huge relief even before you\u2019ve lit it.

I've never done it but I know people who have and the withdrawals can be brutal, it's not as easy as \"stop and you'll be fine after a few days\", especially since he was so agitated and panicky over it.\n\nYTA, not for making him quit, smoking is gross and bad for you and is a nasty habit to have especially at his age, but for the way you did it. Couldn't have weaned him off it? Got him some gum, patches, candies? This is a surefire way to get him to smoke behind your back to deal with the cravings/withdrawals.

It's so...smug. I'll bet you're going to punish him for his fits too. It's not a habit. It's an addiction. It is physically awful.

Smoking also increases anxiety and it sounds like he\u2019s already got enough anxiety as it is.", "NTA but agree the son will find ways to smoke behind OP's back. I used to be heavily addicted when I was 16-17. There were reasons I had to formulate on my own to stop. I didn't use anything to help me stop, I stopped cold turkey and was successful, just like you explained. After that, there were a few times I picked it up again but only in a social drinking/party setting, but it never hooked me back to addiction. It's been about 5 years since I've smoked last.\n\nI initially stopped when my niece saw me smoking so much she imitated the smoking motion. I felt horrible about having her see me smoke so much, that at a young age she picked up on it. Before that happened, I hated how physically incapable I was and how bad it made me feel. Walking up even one flight of stairs made me winded and my complexion/skin looked really bad. \n\nThere are days where I think of doing it, but it's honestly not worth it with everything I experienced, a temporary high is not worth my health in the long run. Probably not what you want to hear OP, but that was just my story and how it worked out for me. Everyone is different. I'm not sure if your son will find a good enough reason on his own. \n\nAlso, I want to add that what helped me stick to going cold turkey was an anti-smoking AD I saw back then. It explained the lung cancer risk/percentage from the hour, day, week and month from stopping smoking. It kept me accountable; that the healing my lungs was doing would be tarnished if I went back.

Nicotine withdrawal alone is hard, clearly tobacco companies put a lot of effort into making their products as physically addictive as possible.

Playing with the cellophane strip off the pack, fidgeting with the lighter, tapping the cigarette to pack the tobacco, the crinkle of the cellophane, the smell of the tobacco when you open the pack, the patterns the smoke makes in the air\u2026 literally every sense is stimulated as part of the addiction. A common stumbling block in quitting is that people don\u2019t deal with the behavioral aspect of the addiction. \n\nIt\u2019s the same deal with the little habits that crop up around drinking for alcoholics, if you had a ritual with popping a beer open or mixing a drink when you got home every night.", "Withdrawal lasts 2-4 weeks, longer depending on how long and much you\u2019ve been smoking, and you\u2019re not thinking of the fact this is a *coping mechanism* for an obsessive compulsive disorder.

It can help you to be calm, but it isn\u2019t going to make you drowsy or anything and could easily be missed or written off as placebo. It also has the usual minor anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects to the same degree, comparable to something like tylenol or aspirin.\n\nPersonally I found the effect to be the perfect counter for nicotine withdrawal.", "I said withdrawal peaks in a week, not that it lasts for a week.\n\nI have never seen credible evidence that quitting smoking exacerbates any mental health condition in a clinically significant way. I pointed out Big Tobacco because they specifically funded a ton of messaging that argued that smoking helped people with certain serious mental health problems such as schizophrenia, that quitting could trigger psychosis, that people in recovery from other addictions shouldn't quit smoking at the same time because it would be \"too stressful\" and endanger their sobriety, on and on and on. They sent cases of cigarettes to mental hospitals and homeless shelters---again, explicitly arguing that it would be too much stress to ask the unhoused to also quit smoking. That was unfounded bullshit. They never had a shred of evidence to support these claims. In fact, smoking itself is a major stressor for multiple reasons, including that it has been shown to exacerbate or even cause multiple mental health problems. Your argument is almost certainly informed by their systematic, decades long, multi-million dollar campaign to sway discourse on the safety and effectiveness of quitting smoking on mental health, and it's a testament to how effective it was/is that you don't even seem to be aware of that.\n\nThere are two issues with quitting smoking related to mental health: people taking clozapine might need doses adjusted because nicotine, surprise surprise, acts in a way that fucks with the medicine. That is, they might be able to lower their clozapine dosage, generally a positive for a medication that can have pretty serious side effects and requires careful blood level testing. Second, nicotine can temporarily boost concentration and focus, arguably having some effect on reducing negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia and/or serious depression. These effects are not worth the trade off.\n\n\nSmoking cigarettes is unbelievably damaging in almost every conceivable way. If OP's son picked himself bald, it would be almost impossible for that to somehow cause even 1% of the problems caused by a lifelong smoking habit.
