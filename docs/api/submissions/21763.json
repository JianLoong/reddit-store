He was contrite and agreeable enough but when I mentioned taking his cigarettes away he started freaking out, saying he couldn't quit just like that.\n\nI told him I wasn't going to have him smoking around his little brothers or setting a bad example, and that he'd be okay after a few days. He argued that I couldn't throw away the cigs because they're \u201chis stuff,\u201d but I told him I could make an exception here since legally he isn't supposed to have them anyway.

I'm not an expert on solving addiction, but this is maybe a discussion you should be having with his dad? Or maybe finding some sort of professional to consult on best practice. Quitting smoking is a net good, but it needs to happen in a way that will be effective and stick for it to be worth doing in the first place.\n\nEvery smoker I know who's succeeded in quitting has done it cold turkey, btw. The smokers I know who fail and try over and over are generally the ones relying on nicotine patches, vaping, ect, and other crutches. But that's a small sample size of anecdotal evidence.\n\nI'm also not going to call a child going through a drug withdraw an asshole for acting out. Withdraw from nicotine does cause issues with mood regulation, that's normal.\n\nNAH but talk to his dad, see if there's any real advice you can find about this from real experienced people and not reddit randoms, and don't second-guess yourself or hold it against your child when a child going through nicotine addiction gets irritable.", "NAH except his father who is enabling this. I don\u2019t think the way you\u2019re going about it is helpful though. You can\u2019t just tell someone to not be addicted anymore and expect it to go away. Maybe seek therapy. Your son is clearly having a hard time coping with anxiety, and as his parent you need to address that directly. Taking his cigs away is only going to make him resent you and sneak around.", "NTA\n\nYour home, your rules. He\u2019s not even of legal age in most places.", "Smoking is an addiction.  Your son already has some psychological issues (hair pulling is associated with obsessive compulsive disorder).  Talk to his physician about a safe smoking cessation program.  The last thing you want is for him to take up chewing tobacco, which causes cancer even faster than smoking.  Get your son a meditation app for his phone.  Try hypnosis.  But ultimately, he won't quit untl he is ready.  (Saying this as a former smoker).", "He's 16, so no, NTA", "NTA. BUT it might be helpful to offer him therapy/rehab facilities to make quitting easier on him. He shouldn\u2019t be allowed to smoke at all but you can try and equip him with tools to deal with it in a healthy way. He shouldn\u2019t be allowed to smoke at all but a therapist might be the best long and short term solution.", "I\u2019d back off if you want him to continue visiting you. He\u2019s old enough to stay away if he wants to.", "NTA, smoking kills and your son is too young to have such a dangerous habit. Most people who quit smoking are irritable to say the least. Maybe sit down and express your concerns for his health, your love for him, and brainstorm together tools to help him feel better and quit. Now might be the moment to offer radical support to a teen that\u2019s going through something that isn\u2019t even easy for adults to do.", "NTA, he\u2019s already freaking out at the thought of being without nicotine, cold turkey is the only way. He\u2019s 16, that\u2019s an addictive substance and you have rules. \n\nAs an ex-smoker that switched to stupid vaping I can tell you nicotine is one of the hardest things to quit so you better stop that \u201chabit\u201d right now.", "NTA. One: he\u2019s way too young. Two: it\u2019s a disgusting habit that will kill you.", "NTA, though I imagine his mood will suck for awhile.", "If you want him to kick it for good go to a doctor and get a recommendation on how he can safely quit in a way that will succeed.  Possibly with a prescription for stuff that takes away the smoking cravings.\n\nYTA for not getting him the help to be successful at quitting.", "YTA - cold turkey is the least effective method of quitting. All you're doing here is hurting the relationship with your son. Buy the kids some gum or patches to use while he's staying with you and let him choose what to do when he returns.", "NTA", "NTA but he is going to probably be horrid for the next few days regardless, Peoples mood dips quickly when they stop smoking particularly  cold turkey. Depending on how long he is smoking he may also get quitters flu. As a peace offering I would get him some nicotine patches/gum to help him along. \n\nQuitting cold turkey is hard (speaking from experience) but its going to be even harder for him as it's not his choice and it's something he doesn't want to do. It takes will power. You are doing the right thing, help him along and support as you can. He probably wont thank you now but he might when he is older", "NTA but at least let him get nicotine patches or something sheesh", "Definitely NTA.  It\u2019s illegal.  It will kill him. It\u2019s dirty. It stinks. It ruins your skin, teeth, breath\u2026.  All around nope   \n\n(Ex-smoker.  Quit cold turkey)", "Nta. You aren\u2019t the first to toss cigs, etoh, drugs and such. Doesn\u2019t matter if he buys them or not. They are illegal for him to possess. Need to have a talk with daddy dearest as well. If daddy can\u2019t prevent him from partaking in illegal health causing devices\u2026maybe the court needs to get involved.", "NTA. \n\nAlthough I doubt he will quit, but at least he will smoke far less during summer than if you didn\u2019t ban smoking and confiscated his smokes.", "NTA", "NTA.

Yes, that long and started that young. Only quit in Nov of 2021. My biggest recommendation is having a serious conversation. If you set rules and / or stipulations, I guarantee he will break them. If he\u2019s using it as a crutch for anxiety already, he will need to replace it with something else. Quitting cold turkey is absolutely possible (how I did it) and he needs to want to do it himself otherwise it\u2019s not gonna go well.", "NTA but consider what is going to happen as soon as he goes home to his dad.

Get nicotine-salt juice at 50mg/mL.  Dole it out no more than 1ml-1.5ml a day (typical vape pods are around 1ml), dilute it 5-10% every 2 weeks with a propylene-glycol/vegetable glycerin mix equivalent to the original juice you bought. Honestly you don't even have to clue him in on the dilution, but you probably want to or he might end up ditching the vape and going back to smoking 3 weeks from now.\n\nIf he smokes menthols, this will definitely do it.  If not, probably wanna try something else.", "Sorry but YTA. I\u2019m a smoker yeah it\u2019s a bad habit but it\u2019s a hard addiction to quit.
