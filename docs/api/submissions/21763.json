I'm not an expert on solving addiction, but this is maybe a discussion you should be having with his dad? Or maybe finding some sort of professional to consult on best practice.

Nicotine withdrawal will only make his anxiety worse.", "I agree that OP's concerns are for long-term health but the actions taken are focused on short-term results.\n\nOP, look into support groups and other resources in your area.

It affects every part of your life, mind and body both. Take him to a doctor and get him on a nicotine patch or some other treatment that will allow him to wean off slowly. Find a doctor who will explain to him why it's so important to quit now. You're just punishing him for breaking \"house rules\" without realizing how it's affecting him.", "YTA and I do not understand the folks going the other way. Yes it\u2019s her home so it would normally be her rules. But she has a child she only sees 3 months a year and she knows the child has anxiety-related tics.  What isn\u2019t being discussed is whether or not that child with anxiety-related tics has other coping strategies should she take the cigarettes away. Does she even know the answer to that question. Also, if this kid has poor coping strategies, why would she set him up to fail by simply tossing his cigarettes?\n\nSecond reason, YTA is that you simply dismiss the degree to which your child has become addicted to a drug that has physical side effects for quitting. You offer no strategy for helping this kid truly withdraw successfully from his addiction to a drug. Did I say that often enough? It\u2019s a drug and it\u2019s a hard one to kick. I would not be the only recovering addict/alcoholic to say that smoking cigarettes is the hardest thing I ever kicked.  \n\nYou\u2019re mad at someone, your kid was who took the brunt of your mad. Do better.", "Have you got him any actual help to quit or just thrown them away and expected that to work? Have you spoke to his father about what will happen when he goes back?", "YTA\n\nYou seem to be more focused on forcing him to obey rules, than actually worrying about his welfare. Nicotine withdrawal is seriously painful and many people struggle for years to quit. There's no reason you couldn't provide patches, gum or other aids to help him taper off. You also know he's smoking because of anxiety, but don't seem inclined to provide him any better way of coping with it via therapy, medication, or other lifestyle interventions. Without those supports there's zero chance he stops smoking for longer than he is physically at your home. In fact, you're deeply ingraining his dependence by making him feel as awful as possible without the cigarettes.\n\nThe entire approach seems more punitive than parental. If you want him to cope in better ways, do the work to help him find better ways.", "So I work for the AHA- obviously ending tobacco and vaping is a top priority. One thing we really try to focus on with schools is instead of punishing for vaping to get a cessation program together to help kids quit. Punishing them with detention or suspension won\u2019t fix the root of the problem.\n\nObviously NTA for making him quit. But you definitely need to go about this a better way. Just throwing out his cigarettes and essentially throwing him to the wolves is not the way to do it and a good way to push him away.\n\nSaying you\u2019re concerned about him being a \u201cbad influence\u201d on your younger children may make him feel like he\u2019s less important than they are, ESPECIALLY if he\u2019s dealing with anxiety.\n\nSmoking is likely something that helps him cope with his anxiety. I had really bad PPD and have horrible anxiety in general. I was smoking up until I was able to get treatment for it. It was the only way I could calm myself down. Just cutting him off without any sort of support makes you an AH. Nicotine is nightly addictive and hard to quit. It\u2019s why Big Tobacco continues to find ways to hook kids.\n\nTalk with your doctor on ways to help him quit and cope so he doesn\u2019t go off the deep end.\n\nDoes he get consistent mental healthcare? Is he on medication to help his anxiety? If the answer is no, he NEEDS a good therapist. Medicine isn\u2019t for everyone, but he at least needs a counselor to help him with his anxiety.\n\nHis father may not know he is smoking. Or if he does he may be afraid of what withdrawal and quitting will do to him. But you need to have a conversation with him and not be accusatory.\n\nLastly- discover some empathy for your child. He has been thrown into withdrawals against his will and it is going to mess with him. Be supportive of his struggles.", "I was in very situation when I was young, all that came of that was I hid it more and sneaked around more. Get him a vape, yah I get it you don't want him to smoke or use nicotine. But you go to be real with yourself, is taking the hard stance really going to help in the long run?", "throwing away someone's pack doesn't make them a non-smoker, no matter how much you (or they) might wish that was the case \n\n I COMPLETELY understand how nasty smoking is, especially to someone who hasn't ever been a smoker. and I can see how someone who has never been addicted to nicotine might have difficulty understanding just how AWFUL withdrawal is, and how intense it feels. and ofc, as a parent, OBVIOUSLY you care so so much about your child's well-being and happiness:) tossing his pack SEEMS like the best possible move \n\nbut - you haven't healed his addiction. if your son has taken up smoking at 16, he's *struggling* - you just kinda showed him that you aren't willing to show him grace, kindness, and empathy in his time of need. you're just going to bulldoze and make his decisions for him \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\na similar thing happened to me when I was young, and it made me determined to keep smoking because I was an angry young adult lol. important parts of the brain regarding decision-making aren't formed yet, u know? and CONTINUE SMOKING I DID! because I felt unsupported and unheard. I think that time of sneaking and being mad helped solidify my nicotine addiction but idk. finally stopped with the cigs after many years of them, but I still vape to this day\n\nI can't say for sure, but I wonder if my mom would have approached me like a concerned friend rather than a steamroller, I would have felt a little more cared-for and understood, and maybe I wouldn't have become a long-term slave to big tobacco. \n\nsoft YTA. there's no golden rulebook to parenting. I know you meant well", "i i\u2019m probably gonna get downvoted for this but i wouldn\u2019t make him stop smoking necessarily, especially if you want him to be honest with you. my parents tried to make me stop smoking and i did it behind their back. my mom ended up buying my cigarettes because she knew i\u2019d do it regardless after she caught me.", "Nta- I've smoked since I was a kid.

Of course, they left a white powdery film on your lips. So, I had a reason to quit those as well once I was past the habits physical components.

Seriously, those lozenges felt like cocaine-lite. It was against the recommendations. Those said I should have used the lower strength lozenges, but I really feel that the way I did it was why I succeeded.

Not for him, to him. The anxiety, freak outs, insomnia, listlessness, agitation, extreme mood swings (they can be really fucking extreme), racing heart, etc... it can get brutal. \n\n\nAsk if he's interested in alternatives to work on quitting. Patches, lozenges, gum... there's a pill that stops nicotine receptors from working, though it can have some gnarly side effects if I remember correctly.\n\n\nIf those aren't on the table, it's not ideal, but I'd suggest as an alternative, make it really inconvenient to go smoke. Absolutely not on the property, shower when he gets back, clean clothes, yadda yadda. The more of an ordeal it is, the less he's gonna go smoke. Absolutely keep it away from the kids. Not the full win of quitting you're hoping to achieve, but a whole lot better. But if you force it like this? You're a villain to him.

Hold strong on your boundaries but get your kid some support in the way of a program, or therapy, or something. He is going to need to learn how to replace the smokes with a healthier set of coping skills for his anxiety, and someone has to teach that to him. (No, you are not a candidate for that. Needs to be outside the house). In the meantime, maybe he would feel better with some gum or a patch? The feelings of agitation when you quit smoking are awful, as evidenced by the trash cans. He\u2019s certainly struggling and he needs your support and understanding, especially of his \u201cattitude\u201d as he balances out. \n\nThe other problem is that he has to go back to his Dad\u2019s soon, after what is not really enough time to solidify his non-smoking ways.
