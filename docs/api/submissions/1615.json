If they're going to eat half then yes he should split it and just cook half longer.", "OP said 10 people are coming and only 3 prefer med-well to well done meat. It makes no sense to overcook the meat when over half prefer it med-rare.", "Why is their preference more important than his preference? Will their preference not ruin his meal... that he paid for? It sounds like only two to three out of 10 people coming have that med/well preference, So why should they decide for everyone when there are actual compromises available?

You only have to look at the comments here, too, to see plenty of that.  So maybe he deserves to be part of the asshole judgement -- ESH, for example.  He may have provoked her.

Maybe try to explain that with the way the roast cooks, it would be really difficult to cut it in half to cook and would reflect poorly in all cooks of the meat but cooking the roast to medium or whatever lesser cook was wanted and then pan frying the rest to preference would keep that flavor consistency and also get everyone their preferred cook. Hopefully that would be a good option to her. And I would personally apologize for the microwave suggestion even if you had meant the frying pan by the words \u201cnuke it\u201d.

You\u2019ll most likely have some left overs from this, but nothing crazy. \n\nEach bone of a prim rib roast weighs approximately 2.5 lbs. they need at least a 4 bone prime rib.  And that will cost like $250-$300. \n\nYou absolutely want to keep this whole while cooking.

OP is likely talking about a bone in prime rib roast. Anyone who knows how to cook would have realized that immediately. And yes it does make sense. There is no \"perfect cooking\" size, sure. I never said there was so not sure why the quotations. But 2 smaller roasts will cook significantly faster than 1 large one. More time in the oven means more browning. More browning is more flavor. It also means drastically different start times between the two, and then over  ooking a large piece of meat for what sounds like only 3 people thereby wasting it all later. A 3 rib roast is gonna take about 3ish hours  or including rest time. A 6 rib roast is roughly 7 hours. You also don't take a 3 rib roast and cut it in half.

Everyone deserves to eat and feel comfortable doing so. It's about spending time with loved ones and being happy. Thank you for reminding me what's truly important about cooking.\n\nFor me it's because I am passionate. It's because it takes practice, dedication and effort to learn how to properly cook- and by that I mean objectively following a recipe, or following the prescribed method of cooking for a certain ingredient. Like, there is a general consensus for the temperatures that a meat is safe to consume. I'm not saying you can never deviate - that's also one of the beauties of cookinng - to cook things to your preference and how you like it. Trying different techniques, etc. \n\nBut those ingredients cost a lot of money and time to acquire. If I buy a nice cut of sushi-grade fish, and someone comes over and asks me to fry it. That's fine - but I'm not using my sushi grade that cost me an additional $20-30 compared to a normal cut of fish. Or if we do, that kind of sucks for me because I used a lot of my special portion for your recipe that doesn't necessarily need it. I do think it's the onus of the chef to prepare adequately, and then the person can ask them to then take the extra step to cook it for them.

His first suggested compromise (the microwave) was not the best suggestion, and probably did give the impression that he was dismissive of what his wife wanted.  But I'm not impressed by her insisting the entire thing be done only to please her and her parents.\n\nBut for them to be an actual team trying to solve a problem TOGETHER, both he and his wife needed to discuss this like adults, and both try to find a way to honor everyone's preferences.  Which, as this comment section shows, would be easily done, and probably better done, by planning to pan-sear servings for the wife and parents.

When red meat is cooked,  it starts to lose the red color and the ending shade will depend on the internal temperature of the meat, with lower temps (more rare) being redder and higher temps (more well done) being less red and more brown. Many people are uneducated on this fact and assume that the red color and red drippings from their red meat are blood, because blood is red and it's what they're familiar with.
