If they're going to eat half then yes he should split it and just cook half longer.", "OP said 10 people are coming and only 3 prefer med-well to well done meat. It makes no sense to overcook the meat when over half prefer it med-rare.", "Why is their preference more important than his preference? Will their preference not ruin his meal... that he paid for? It sounds like only two to three out of 10 people coming have that med/well preference, So why should they decide for everyone when there are actual compromises available?

You only have to look at the comments here, too, to see plenty of that.  So maybe he deserves to be part of the asshole judgement -- ESH, for example.  He may have provoked her.

It's because it takes practice, dedication and effort to learn how to properly cook- and by that I mean objectively following a recipe, or following the prescribed method of cooking for a certain ingredient.

I'm not saying you can never deviate - that's also one of the beauties of cookinng - to cook things to your preference and how you like it.

That's fine - but I'm not using my sushi grade that cost me an additional $20-30 compared to a normal cut of fish. Or if we do, that kind of sucks for me because I used a lot of my special portion for your recipe that doesn't necessarily need it.

With a less tender piece of meat I can feel the muscle fibers splitt between my teeth. There is some resistance in chewing which I really like. In contrast I really hate the soft slimey texture you get from undercooked meat. It just feels bad and gives me a real aversion for the food. The fat content gives other sensory experiences as well. If the piece of meat is well down it will have a good crust from the fat that melted off. You don't get this from cheaper cuts. And the animals might have fed differently. This results in a different taste of the meat as there are more complex molecules. You can taste this even i the meat is well done. I had excelent cuts from cattle that is at a giant grass land all year without any extra food. I did eat it well done and it taste so much different from store bought meat.
