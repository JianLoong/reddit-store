Shouldn\u2019t she be able to enjoy dinner as well? By splitting the roast he can make everyone happy so why not do it?", "Nuking in a microwave is not the way to do it though", "He is proposing that they cook it in the microwave. He could easily cook part longer in the oven or sear it in a pan.", "It would go a long way to simply bust out a cast iron skillet to bring everyone\u2019s meat up to temp. A cast iron griddle would work perfectly as it accommodates several pieces at a time. \n\nThe short term practical side of this is that you can rest the meat properly and not have to stress over timing everything perfectly. Simply slice and sear when you\u2019re ready to sit. \n\nThe long term practical side is that you have accommodated everyone\u2019s preferences with *respect*. If they\u2019re anted microwave dinners they could stay home and eat a swansons. Why you didn\u2019t offer to do this in a pan or even make something *everyone* likes and instead offered to microwave something so you could have it your way is probably why your wife is mad. And I don\u2019t blame her.\n\nYou could all go out to eat too. Then everyone gets what they want and you don\u2019t damage your relationship with your in laws and wife OVER A PIECE OF MEAT.", "Microwaved meat is gross.  You\u2019re asking them to spoil their meat completely to save you the trouble of cooking it in the oven a little longer.  Just cut the meat down the middle before you put it in the oven, take your medium rare section out sooner and let it rest until the other half is done to their taste.", "Yeah I like mine done the way that you do. No sense in ruining the whole roast. Since you're doing most of the meal, can't your wife sear the pieces for her and her parents in a cast iron skillet? The way you talk it sounds like you are having other guests who will enjoy it more rare. No sense in ruining the whole thing for three people. Assuming your wife is living with you, she is the hostess. I don't understand why she couldn't be involved, since it's only her and her parents who like overcooked meat.", "So 30% of the people there.", "Microwaving it long enough to cook the beef instead of just heating it up definitely is not as good. Why not at least throw the three servings into a pan? Sliced beef cooks extremely fast in a pan.", "Yeah I've done that for different preferences and it works quite well; it's quick too!", "https://www.amazon.com/Lodge-Reversible-Griddle-Combo-Double-Sided/dp/B002CMLTXG/ref=asc_df_B002CMLTXG/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=167141575819&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11720013294563606026&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9029600&hvtargid=pla-138243274155&psc=1\n\nBonus of this is you can get it up to temp on your BBQ so it\u2019s not taking up oven space.\n\nIt also saves you from being forever know as that guy who couldn\u2019t get off his high horse over a piece of meat.\n\nHonestly, if you\u2019re this insufferable over one dinner I can\u2019t imagine what other things you dig your heels in over.", "Yes the bloody well is. Jesus Christ it\u2019s not a preference it\u2019s science.", "Not forcing anything? If they like ruined meat it won't matter how it got that way", "Still disgusting.", "Your opinion. It's disgusting.", "10 people, so a majority prefer it medium rare", "He literally, in the comment you're replying to, said it will be 2-3 people....", "OP can get a cheap one for the folks who want it well done.", "Exactly.   If you cut it when it's medium rare, you'll dry it out since the juices will run out.", "OP plz don't do this. Splitting it is actually harder. They won't cook the same as they would if you simply cooked it whole. Maillard reaction and browning  will be different, & cook times will be drastically different and you run the risk of overcooking or undercooking everything, or it being properly cooked by temp, but without a long enough cook time you won't get the same connective tissue breakdown converting into collagen and it could end up chewy and tough. Just cut the end pieces off when you're done and sear them quickly in a pan for them. So many people here clearly don't cook or know what it costs for a prime rib roast. It's several hundred dollars and hours of work you risk tossing out the window because a couple people want to eat shoe leather.\nNTA", "Ikr just because I prefer my meat slightly more cooked it doesn't mean I like the steak made in the microwave.", "This is exactly what a chef did at a highly rated restaurant where I was a server for people who wanted well done Prime Rib. His method was to keep a pan of Au Jus simmering next to where he cut the prime rib. If anyone wanted well done, their piece got simmered for a few minutes in the au jus. It was standard operating procedure and I never received a complaint.", "Making a roast medium or well done would be inconsiderate to anyone with taste", "Saying you don't like something is not a diss. It is a fact that turkey breast is cheap in comparison and is only cooked to one temp level for all", "Get over what? \"I don't care for turkey\" is about as innocuous a \"diss\" as it could be, lol", "Or they could follow OP's suggestion and cook their pieces more if they want. Everyone who's mature is happy. OP is NTA.", "No, the compromise here is turkey. Clearly, this family cannot have nice things.", "Do you think people who want their beef well done care that it\u2019s rubbery and disgusting? Haha", ":) Yeah, rare and medium rare meat kinda squeaks between my teeth. I can't eat sushi either, darnit. The only sushi or other uncooked meats I have been able to eat and enjoy have been a type of sushi that was ground up (Morimoto's restaurant) and I can eat carpaccio since it's very thin and there is no 'squeaky' or other obvious texture issues. \n\nAnd it's tough, I know, to get beef that is cooked enough but not overcooked for me. I use a method from Alton Brown for t-bones that works wonderfully!\n\nLet's not even talk about how long it took for me to cook pork correctly and be able to eat it, having grown up in the country at a time when trichinosis was still an issue. LOL", "The texture of anything that's not at least medium makes me want to vomit. I have texture issues with food in general, but with meat it's really bad. I prefer medium well but I can tolerate medium.", "Who else is going that maybe doesn't like it overcooked? If its 1-2 people yes it's assholish. If there's 10 others and they like it cooked normal, he's not an asshole for not catering to 2-3 grown adults with picky food preferences.", "But what about the others who prefer med rare? Personally, I wouldn\u2019t eat medium or well done roast, I wouldn\u2019t make a big deal about it but I just wouldn\u2019t eat any (thereby wasting it) medium beef is just gross to me and many others. Either cut the roast and cook each to the desired temperature (doesn\u2019t have to be in half) or have a plan for cooking the appropriate amount to the desired doneness that does not include the microwave. My mom likes hers medium the rest of us rare to medium rare so we put hers under the broiler for a minute or so and she likes it. If she didn\u2019t, we definitely would figure out a way for everyone to get good food they enjoyed!", "You can\u2019t uncook meat. You CAN cook it past medium rare to get it to what you want. You\u2019re disturbingly dramatic about this lmao.", "On a roast, there's usually two...", "He\u2019ll need at least 6 end pieces (wide and her parents) and that is not possible. \nOp is TA\n\nOp: YTA", "Couldn't he even just pop theirs back in the oven for a few more minutes after he cuts the medium parts out?", "So over the top, my grandparents have been happily microwaving beef and lamb for 1 min for 40 years. They get that their preference is not everyone else's and you can't uncook meat, but you can cook it more. NTA.", "Nope, since they've done it at my house and other places multiple times before.", "Reddit always goes to the extremes with things lmao. They\u2019re going to stop attending family holidays because they were forced to use the microwave for a few minutes? These are grown adults, right? \n\nHow about the rudeness of expecting OP to mess with everyone else\u2019s meal because 2-3 coming can\u2019t stand waiting a few minutes. It\u2019s not like OP could uncook the meal for the majority of people there who want it medium rare", "If someone thinks a marriage should end over a roast they have other problems, lol", "So because 3 people want well done the other 7-8 people want medium rare, it\u2019s disrespectful for the 3 people not to cook for the minority? They can have their piece cooked a bit more and be happy, OP can\u2019t un-cook the meat for the rest of the guests", "Whilst the spouse you claim is being rejected is contemporaneously rejecting the feelings of her spouse and his family. \n\nSo he is the chef. \n\nI\u2019d hate to be at your thanksgiving supper if you cannot imagine it being a dinner party.", "That's fine. Use a pan. Put it under the broiler. People can leatherize their own meat in the manner of their choosing.", "Never said as good, said it won\u2019t ruin. However roasting beyond MR does ruin it. Put it in a pan, sure. Cook two roast, sure. Cut some slices off and throw it under the broiler, sure. Multiple options here. Cooking it her way prevents him and his family from enjoying it according to their taste.", "It's obviously a preference, her family prefer it a different way to OP. You can scream about science all you like but that won't get them to change how they enjoy food, they'll just know you're opinionated and unwilling to cater for the guests you invite to your meals.", "You're being really insulting and super pretentious now. Do you want her parents to hate you?", "Making them recook their own meat is a slap in the face, it's the opposite of being a good host. Just make a turkey. You're a total ass about red meat.", "Yours taste like show leather", "Eh, ok. That's trickier if 2-3 out of 10 want it well done.\n\nNew suggestion. \n\nCook to 10 minutes below medium rare. \nCut off the end bits. And let them rest on the bottom of the pan. \nThrow back in oven and finish\n\nPeople that want well done get that extra crispy, crackling edges to their meat with some extra maillard reaction tastiness.\n\nMedium rare people get their medium rare meat. \n\nEveryone gets served at same time.

Your whole post is my preferences and what I like.  You don't care about anyone else's tastes.", "Big cheap hunk of meat? Is a diss", "Microwave \"cooking\" is really not the same, nor a great compromise. It definitely alters both the taxture and taste of the meat.", "I love carpaccio! I'm in the US so it's really hard to find here.\n\nAs I said before, this conversation has been a revelation. And you saying that you like carpaccio is also amazing! Since it clearly tastes like raw/rare meat, yet you still enjoy it even though you're someone who likes meat that's cooked past medium.", "Obviously that's not enough", "No lol - the end pieces aren\u2019t literally just one slice off the end, it\u2019s the ENDS of the meat cut into multiple slices. I do the same damn thing at Christmas and get more than enough out of it.", "I was with you until this point, but I see your other comments so hopefully you\u2019re not going this route. I completely agree that roast more done than medium rare is honestly sacrilege and truly when I am out with new friends and they order it well done I wonder if they will ever realize how terrible their food is HOWEVER microwaving is gross and not cool for your guests put it on a pan and cook it longer", "So this isn't even the first time this has come up. This is definitely ending in a divorce. Lol. Some people just don't learn from their mistakes.", "The roast wouldn't be the reason. But respecting your wife's opinion and family will be.\n\nIt's impossible for this to be the only topic you minimize your wife over.", "Guess what? You're not invited.", "Totally agree, but OP is saying he's going up cook the meat how he likes and they can go microwave theirs afterwards if they're not happy. That's the asshole part IMO", "Individually cooking pieces of meat makes them taste like garbage. All juice is gone. It's disrespectful", "So why at the same time dismiss the preference of him and his family. Grow up.", "I like mine medium well. Thin line of pink. The bloody looking juice is disgusting.", "Fucking butcher the roast...", "Given context clues, op is saying it's only 2-3 people who aren't ok with MR. Pretty obvious , \"it's likely only 2-3 people and I've seen them do this before which is why I thought it was OK.\" paraphrasing.", "\"It's likely only 2-3 people.

He is describing turkey?\n\n*this* is a diss. Turkey is the fucking worst meat you can eat off any animal humans regularly consume. There is literally no way in which it is not just inferior chicken, but I respect people's right to be wrong about enjoying it.", "Yeah OP is clearly a snob, lol.", "LOL, I hope the turkey isn't too offended :)", "It is difficult to find. And yeah, I like the taste, the feel in my mouth makes it impossible for me to enjoy though when it's thicker.", "Genuinely, why does it matter to you what your friends order if you're not the one who has to eat it? That just seems pointlessly judgmental.", ">This is definitely ending in a divorce.\n\nBet.", "You're exactly right.  OP is awful.", "Why would you want to continue to be married to someone whose family sucks this fucking bad anyway lol that sounds like a win", "There are three choices here: 1) do it this way, 2) the well-done crowd eats the ends or 3) cook poultry and we can all agree when its done.", "No one who demands well done meat is in it for the juice.", "You care only about yourself. It's very clear in your post and comments.  Your poor wife and family. Enjoy your selfishness on a family holiday!", "The majority of the people want it cooked longer", "No one is demanding it well done just not squishy and bloody. Meat cooked to medium is very juicy and not gross and chewy.", "Repeating something doesn't make it true buddy", "No, they don\u2019t. OP already stated that there are 10 people coming to dinner and only 2-3 of those people want it cooked longer", "But they don't want medium. They want medium well or well done.
