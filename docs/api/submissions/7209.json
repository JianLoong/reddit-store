I don't know if I did something that can classify me as an AH. So I am asking you. Please do tell me your honest opinion. Thanks in advance for reading this.\n\nMy wife (fake name: Hannah - 32F) and I (34F) had invited my SIL (fake name: Anne - 28F) and her family over for lunch. We all had a good time. Our kids were playing together in the garden after we ate. (We have two daughters, my SIL has two sons and a daughter)\n\nSo I was putting the dishes in the dishwasher. Anne came by my side and started up a conversation about how I saw many complicated diseases at work (I'm a neurologist). I have the unfortunate habit of getting a bit over myself when someone mentions something about my work. So my SIL mentioned a disease and said she had read up on it and asked me what it really was. I went on to explain. I don't want to mention exactly what it is, but most people who have it only last until their early 20s.\n\nWhen I was done putting the dishes in the dishwasher, I turned to look at Anne and she had tears in her eyes. It was heartbreaking. Hannah came in and asked me what was going on. I said I talked about a disease and it may have gotten her emotional a bit because it was unfortunately not a treatable one.\n\nAnne got her kids immediately and left. Hannah and I were both extremely confused. Later, Anne's husband called me and told me I was an absolute AH for doing what I did to Anne. I still didn't know what it was that I had done. Turns out, one of Anne's sons had been diagnosed with that disease and she was asking me to see if it was as bad as his doctor had made it sound. I genuinely had no idea. My wife sometimes asks me questions the same way and I thought it was because of genuine interest in something that had read upon.\n\nMy MIL also gave Hannah a call and said I should apologise for how I acted with Anne. Hannah said that there was nothing to apologise for anyway. She said she knew her wife, and she was sure that if I did know, I would have been extremely sensitive. \n\nAnyways I later convinced Hannah to get some flowers. We went to Anne's house, I handed her the flowers and said I was sorry and that I didn't know and that I would be with her if there was anything she needed me to do. She called me an AH and told me I couldn't fix what I had done with stupid flowers. I didn't argue. We came back home. Now I know she is going through a lot. However, I was also wondering if I am a major AH here. Please if I am, do tell me so.", "created_utc": 1673605154, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ar3nn/aita_for_bluntly_answering_a_sensitive_question/", "score": 124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were asked a question with no context and answered it as an expert in the field would. It\u2019s heartbreaking for her, but her anger is wholly misplaced in you. \n\nBut she also probably just needs someone to be mad at right now and for a while. You apologized, time to give some space while letting them know you\u2019re still there for them.", "NTA. If she had come to you and said \"my child has been diagnosed with this\" you would have tempered your answer for a loved one or declined to answer. Instead she made it sound like she was just curious about something and you gave an honest answer.\n\nIt's her own fault. It must be awful to hear that your child is living on borrowed time, but she did this to herself. She *knew* what the diagnosis meant, sounds like both the doctor and the internet informed her of this. She went to you looking for false hope, and instead got the unfiltered truth. Now, possibly because of her own emotional turmoil, she has a baddie to blame for everything she feels, and that is you. It doesn't matter to any of them that she's upset and angry over the situation and displacing her feelings on to you.\n\nBack off, stop apologising and trying to make up for it. If any of them ask for any medical advice about it from here on tell them that you can't ethically offer advice about a loved one, that there are other resources they can use, and remind them (if all else fails) that you are refusing to be involved *medically* so you don't accidentally cause more hurt feelings if the advice given doesn't match reality. After all, now they have a history of withholding vital information which would normally be used to provide comprehensive advice.", "NTA you didn't know. You were set up & they got mad at you for answering her question? WTH???", "NTA. You weren\u2019t aware of why you were being asked and their misdirected anger at the diagnosis and their feeling of helplessness is aimed at you. Such a sad situation and I hope medical advances can help your young nephew", "Nta. First you didnt know tact was needed because noone told you. Second she asked you a question about a disease that she had read about. How in the hell were you supposed to get \"what is this cause my kid was diagnosed with it\" from that?? In no way did you intentionally scare her or hurt her. Shes the one who didnt present herself correctly not you.", "NTA. You gave professional advice, whether you knew about the Son's condition or not telling the truth is the only option here. Yes it's upsetting but it would be way better than lying.", "NTA. Your SIL could have told you before asking the question if she wanted a more sensitive answer. You have done everything correctly the way I see it. But be patient with SIL as it's an extremely difficult time for her. I'm sure she'll come around and get past this. She sure needs your support and expertise!", "NTA\n\nDon't worry, you did nothing wrong. Anne asked you a question, and you answered it. How were you supposed to know her child was diagnosed with it without her telling you? Telepathy?\n\nHonestly though, maybe just wait. I think Anne is probably in a world of hurt, and I think she'll come around eventually.", "NTA\n\nShe asked information about a disease in general, so you had no reason to be sensitive about it. I can understand she got emotional and lashed out, but she should have realised this is not on you as soon as she calmed down.", "NTA, sounds like it was brought up pretty casually, you had no reason to think she had a personal connection. I'm sure you would've been more graceful if given the context. SIL is understandably upset about it all, and those emotions have spilled out to blame you.", "NTA, you said it yourself, you didn't know. don't blame Anne either for being angry as I can imagine her having to deal with that. Though blaming you for it is unfair, I do believe this is just an exhaust for her frustrations. don't pay it any mind.", "NTA - how could you have known? It is terrible what's happening to your SIL and her family. I wouldn't wish that to my worst enemy.\n\nThe only thing you can do is be there if they have questions, but don't feel guilty for what you said.", "NTA It's not your fault you didn't know it was personal question for her. Also her anger is more likely because of the disease and they are angry and don't know how to deal with all the feelings and situation. Hopefully they will calm down and see that you didn't know the situation and that if you did you would be a little gentler about answering but the results would still be the same that it's sadly untreatable.", "While I understand that Anne is going through a lot right now, and she probably isn't in her right mind, she is being irrational.\n\nNTA: Anne just asked you about this disease in general, and you explained what it is.\n\nHad she told you right away that it was about her son, you could have been less brutal (if you were), saying that perhaps one day medical research will find drugs and therapies, but I think that, after all, it is useless to hide the truth. If it's an incurable disease... it's incurable. It doesn't change, whatever words you use.", "NTA   \nSomeone asked you a question about your actual job and you answered it. Of course it's not your fault.", "NTA. I\u2019m a doctor too and things like this are why I\u2019m extra extra careful about answering random questions.", "NTA\n\nShe's right in that flowers won't fix her and her husband's genetics.\n\nNew rule - don't answer any medical questions unless they are coming from a colleague.  \n\nYour SIL is taking out her anger on you because she can.  You only told her what her son's doctor told her.  She was hoping for a different answer.   This would have me taking a big step back form anything medical in the family at all.  Definitely don't go above and beyond for SIL's family as you will be blamed for not doing enough.  You'll be asked once she calms down.  No referrals, no suggestions, just don't discuss it.", "NTA. Major or otherwise.\n\nIf this is real, SIL is angry about her child's diagnosis. If she didn't want to know what her child's doctor already told her, she shouldn't have asked a family member. Second opinions should be given during an actual appointment.", "NTA - she didn't give you any context so you had no idea about her kid having this condition. They're understandably upset about their kid having a condition with poor prognosis, but taking it out on other people is an AH move.", "NTA she tricked you by leaving out context, so the consequences are on her. She'd of googled it anyway.", "I'm torn between NTA and NAH on this one.\n\nYou're obviously not the asshole because you were given no context. I would ordinarily call Anne the AH here because she was clearly probing without context so she could get the most honest answer from you and that's what she got - it's not your fault that she didn't like what she learned. However, if it's now sinking in that she won't have one of her kids for long then her overreaction is understandable, even if it's wrong for her to take it out on you.\n\nYou've tried to make amends, I think now just sit tight and wait for Anne to calm herself and realise what's important. I think she may feel like she's had the rug pulled from under her and people tend not to act rationally in such situations.", "Hmm NAH, you just answered the question and your SIL asked it without being prepared to hear a worst case scenario. Maybe in the future ask why someone is interested in knowing about a disease before going into detail about it? Especially if it's a life threatening/limiting one.\n\nEDIT: referred to OP's sister rather than SIL", "NTA... we probably can't get the exact context here because we'd need the exact wording of how she asked, and how you answered...\n\nBut in general, no malice here, so NTA... at worst, you might have been a little clueless... I guess, going forward, if someone asks you about a terminal disease/condition, ask why they're asking? Sounds tedious to me, but will avoid you ever having to go through this situation again...", "NTA...having said that, if someone randomly asks you oddly specific question like that, it's always because they are or someone they know is going through it/been diagnosed. Because of your profession ALWAYS ask why they are asking if someone seemingly out of the blue starts asking specifically about particular conditions and the like.\nI mean the moment you said she was asking about your job and stuff you have seen, I thought, \"hubby or one of the kids has been diagnosed with something\" and I wasn't even there.\n\nI'm more surprised that you were so surprised about how this has gone down tbh, my gf works in care for people with special needs and has medical training, worked in hospitals etc & I even have had people asking me if I know or to ask me about things she has told me about and I'm not even in the medical field, so I'm Sus of the fact that you ARE in the medical field and have been clearly for a few years and frankly you're just old enough to not be suprised that people ask about stuff like this in the way SIL has.\n\nAs I say, NTA, but it's not an excuse to be totally ignorant of how people are around asking medical questions, being a medical professional.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't think you should have a bothered with the flowers, you should have just let it blow over.", "NTA. Anne was deceptive and is upset because you told the truth. You can\u2019t help people like this. She needs someone to be mad at right now - and it is you.", "NTA\n\nShe didn't tell you why she was asking and for who. You answered it like you would any other question and she got upset, which is heartbreaking to know your child won't live long but clearly the Dr also told her the disheartening news and she didn't think it was right so she googled it and then asked you as well.\n\nI don't even look up my mom's disease because I don't want to face the reality of it and it breaks my heart. But I also know my sister is very into researching it and making sure our mom is ok in that aspect. She won't get anymore tests done so there's that. But if I was asking the Dr and knew they wouldn't sugarcoat it without context that's on me.", "NTA. Your SIL is going through something bad but she is dumping her feelings on you without justification. She asked a question. You answered her. If she had wanted handling with kid gloves she should have given you some context. You\u2019re not a mind reader and it wasn\u2019t a consultation in your work office. You were having a casual conversation in the kitchen while doing dishes, not talking to patient\u2019s parent.", "NTA - You did nothing wrong , SIL asked a question and dont mention her son and you answer like a professional", "NTA. I'm also in the medical field and have had people ask medical questions in this way then get upset at me because they were not prepared for the answer. She should never have put you in that position.", "NTA\n\nWow, talk about using someone else as a punching bag. We all get it, she's in distress mode, no need to be an AH and project all that onto someone you asked for general info\u2014especially someone who can provide a needed specific support in the future. Don't engage until they/she apologizes or make concilatory gestures (if too proud to apologize).", "NTA - your wife's family is out of line.", "NTA, although that's a heartbreaking situation.  You couldn't have known and acted kindly to correct the error. She's going through a lot right now though if she just found out, so give her time to grieve.", "Nta. You did nothing wrong. You answered a question. Not your fault you didn't have prior knowledge of the situation", "NTA. DMD ( which I am assuming this may be?) Is a horrible disease... You didn't know she was asking about your nephew and his possible dx. I'm truly sorry for your family, just keep being there for her and keep the lines of communication open.", "NTA. She likely didn't give you the context because she wanted an unfiltered opinion. If you'd said it was less serious than other doctor, she'd have been over moon and buying your flowers. But you gave a unbiased review of an illness and it was bad.\n\nNow you are the target for all her grief and anger at situation because you confirmed the worst. Time is the only mender for that and I suspect, once given time to move through the grief progress (I know child still alive but she's resetting expectations and that is grieving for could have beens) from shock and anger to acceptable, she'll be back in touch. Give her space - you've apologised for bad bedside manner but don't beat yourself up, you didn't know there was a bed to be beside. \n\nThe one learning I'd take is ask why the person is asking in future.", "You\u2019re NTA. \n\nThey are projecting the pain of the diagnosis on to this unfortunate situation.", "NTA, you didn't know.  You are her BIL, she should have let you know why she was asking.", "NTA but this post made me cry, not sure why, I must be hormonal. I hope you can find a way to mend things. And perhaps a lesson to take on board that I\u2019m future if someone asks a question just assume it could be something they are experiencing or concerned about.", "NTA. She came to you for a second opinion without disclosing that she was looking for a second opinion. Apparently she was expecting a more favorable prognosis because you\u2019re family, I guess?", "NAH. Just try to be there for there if they need comfort or information or an advocate.", "NTA \n\nLike if you ask anyone about whaglt they come across in their profession with no prior context, you're going to give an honest answer. Just sounds like your SIL is being so rude and harsh towards you.", "NTA. It's awful but she set you up for failure. She asked a question posing it as a feigning interest and not a life changing question. She was hoping that the doctor was lying and that someone close to her would give her the real truth, assuming you'd say everything is actually dandy and great and there's nothing to worry about. She has misplaced anger but it isn't your fault.", "NTA.\nYou were asked a question as a professional in your field with ZERO context and you provided knowledge. Definitely NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYou told her what she asked to hear, not what she wanted to hear.\nShe told you she was interested because she had been doing some reading, not because she had some bad news.\n\nIf she had said \u201cOP, we took son to the Dr and they think he has X, is it really as awful as they say?\u201d you could have phrased your answers less bluntly (and would probably have found out what she knew, what she wanted to know, and fired some warning shots).\n\nBut pretending everything is fine, nothing to indicate she was asking about her own child\u2026what did she honestly expect you to do other than tell the truth.\n\nThe only way YWBTA is if you knew nephew was sick and hadn\u2019t quite put it all together\u2026", "NTA.  She asked you a question.  You answered it.  She didn't say it was related to her son and she is transferring the anger to you.  She may not realise she's being unreasonable, because she's got a lot going on right now.", "NAH - You are definitely not an AH, you wrote the post sincerely for starters, you genuinely think you might have F'd up. But you have not. How were you to know the reason she asked you (yeah I guess you could have asked why, but she already said she read up on it)\n\nYou apologised and went to her house with flowers (I was gonna suggest you do apologise as a way to be polite) she then called you an AH.\n\nShe doesn't truly think you are an AH. She is going through a very difficult time, effectively knowing she is going to lose her son. She hates the world, she wants something or someone to hate, any one who gets in her way will feel her wrath, and kind of rightly so. Just let the dust settle, and be supportive where you can.", "NAH. You answered honestly without knowing the context, and she ambushed you.\n\nDon't beat yourself up, the situation is very hard and your SIL is dealing with fear, anger, and grief over this devastating news. Give her some grace while this pain is fresh and I'm sure she'll realize you did nothing wrong.", "This is an excellent answer. NTA", "Exactly. What Anne *hoped* to hear was \"That disease isn't so bad, it's totally treatable, most people completely recover!\" but instead she got a second opinion that her child is destined to die young.\n\nOP comes to the door with flowers, but all she can think when she sees OPs face is visions of her own child dying in a hospital bed.\n\nIt's a heartbreaking time and Anne is just not able to separate her emotions from logic at the moment. OP did nothing wrong but Anne needs time.", "Agree", "It's horrible news she's been given but it's still not justifiable for SIL, sils husband and MILs reaction to her doing nothing wrong so definitely NTA.", "You're right it does happen. She mentioned it quite casually but I should have known better. To be frank, the disease she asked me about is a genetic disease and more than 90% of the time, someone else in the family is also affected. At least a distant relative or something. Since it is not something that runs in my wife's family (it is transmitted through the mother only; X-linked), I just didn't think it would involve her son. I honestly thought it was curiosity. Sadly, she was among the unfortunate few.", "Or they could have read about it or seen it in a movie and then asked a neurologist they know about it because they are curious.", "That is why I would say NAH rather than NTA. Anne did not handle it well but she just found out she is likely going to outlive her child. No parent wants to hear that. \n\nOP did not do anything wrong. Anne is struggling and needs time to come to terms with her child's diagnosis but I have a hard time labeling her as an asshole.", "I am very sorry you find yourself here, knowing that one of her kids is going through this and I understand that you must be feeling guilty about how this has gone down.\n\nAnd I'm sure in the fullness of time SIL will come around. Despite my comment, you're not a bad person, nor do I see you as one or think others should, I guess I'm good at playing devil's advocate, I'm seeing it from her POV as well as a complete outsider.\n\nIt's like why some people say they wouldn't tell a friend their partner was cheating, as the messenger of this news you are seen as somehow complicate/at fault (no matter how misguidedly). In the same way that some people in the cheating situation shoot the messenger for the reason of \"you took away my happiness by telling me\", she most likely sees you right now as the person who took away her hope. And to be absolutely clear, she is wrong to think this, but from the sounds of it, she has just found out one of her children will not live a full or \"normal\" life or this diagnosis is a particularly cruel death sentence, worse, in her eyes, you did this very casually.\n\nTo make the quote suit me, to her it was the worst day of her life, for you it was just another day.\n\nAgain, this is not your fault, but to SIL it feels that way right now\nI'm so sorry you are bearing the brunt of this.", "Context is king here.\n\nOut of genuine curiosity, she wouldn't have sought her out on her own to ask for that reason or reasons of like \"oh I heard this term and have no idea what it means\" Vs seeking out someone when they are alone and asking them.", "Yeah context is king and who would randomly discuss their dying child in the kitchen while the other person is putting dishes in the dishwasher."]}
