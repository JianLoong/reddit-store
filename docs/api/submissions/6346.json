I got burnt out and decided to call it quits since I want to move on and my husband was worried about my mental state. Its been a few months since I stop but I recently notice that my photos has been going around to some sketchy websites I was heavily concern. I was able to trace it back and found out that \"Dee\" has been using my stuff and posting and pretending to be me. Since my face isn't on the the photos she thought it was fine to take them. I told her that I didn't  feel comfortable and to please take them down. She yelled at me saying I had it all and this was her chance making some extra cash and its not hurting anyone. But I just really don't feel comfortable and my huaband says I should definitely take legal action. I know Dee has some struggles but I just feel weirded out the fact she uses my stuff. WIBTA if I decided to sue her?\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nSo this was a lot more quicker than I expected. I guess she realized that I wasn't going to step down and everything has been taken down and removed. Not only she getting cut off I have also inform her family about the situation and as it turns out she wasn't struggling at all. They forced her to pay me every dime and ask me if I still want to take her to court. The situation ended up getting wrapped up pretty quickly so its better to cut her out but just in case keep the evidence if she tries to oull another stunt. I am honestly tired.

You politely asked her to cease; she rather rudely declined to do so. \n\nIf you want to pursue a compromise path, see about having an attorney draft a Cease & Desist letter to send to her. If she continues after that, then you can honestly say you gave her every opportunity to avoid a court date.\n\n...and seriously: think long and hard about whether you really want this type of *friend* in your life.", "NTA.

If needed I have enough evidence", "Well technically yes, in order to verify fron OF I have have to go through the really strict process of showing my ID to make sure I'm not a catfish and a not a bot. And I always had the unedited veraion of my photos (i either blurred, cropped and put a watermark of somesort in the photos)", "Because she is making actual profit using my photos, not only she will have to pay every dime she will can also get serious trouble because this falls in revenge porn law bc the state we live in.", "Go to court.

She was trying to earn income based on your physical characteristics, thereby any negative consequences such as stalkers would be on you, while she did zero work and put in no effort. \n\nShe\u2019s not your friend. She\u2019s a snake \ud83d\udc0d be careful who you associate with, you don\u2019t know what else they are capable of.\n\nAlso, what she did is illegal. File a police report, in some states like CA it falls under revenge porn laws.", "I believe you would have to show intent of harrasment or intimidation for it to be revenge porn. Even if not you are again showing a complete lack of any legal understanding.\n\n\nSuing her would be done in civil court. The revenge porn claim would be vetted by authorities and go through criminal court if the authorities decided to charger her.", "Ok now I get it. I just think you may end up spending way more on attorney fees than you will actually get back but I would probably do it!", "You might be entitled to any money she made off of the pictures(good luck collecting without spending even more), but that is about it. You especially aren't entitled to any damages since you can't be identified in the images. Sorry, there are other remedies that will yield better results for a lot less, if any, money up front.", "Oh that part is covered! The photos that were used were edited. As in cropped, blurred, used a emoji etc. I also have the unedited versions if need to be shown as well. That's why I am not worried about if I have to go to court. The issue about me going is because I genuinely really saw her as a close friend. And having to do this really makes me feel awful but I need to be firm", "I don't think you understand. You weren't harmed by the publication of these photos *because* you cropped and blurred them. You didn't lose a job. Any mental anguish would be minimal. She isn't impacting your income since you already stopped.\n\n\nYou won't get anything by suing her. Even if awarded, sounds like she is not well off so then you would then need to hire a collection agency or spend more money with lawyers to start garnishing any wages.", "I don't think you quite understand this situation. The problem is that this can go south in many different ways I have already had a previous history of multiple people going as far as stalking the wrong person thinking they were me and finding there address. Or finding out there is a whole cult about myself while I was still running the platform. If she Isnt careful OR decided to name drop, its puts my whole life in danger and everyone around me. The money doesn't matter to me I just want her to realise this is a massove issue.", "What financial harm have you suffered to date?\n\n\nYou could go at it with the intent to have them taken down, but that can be done cheaper and easier through other channels. Suing her will not land her in jail. You do understand the difference between  civil and criminal court, right?", "Okay, I think you need to realise a few things\n\n1. I am trying my very best to not using court because its a long process.\n2. I AM using easier methods however, if she continues to do it then I WILL execute legal action\n3. What she has done is literally illegal and she openly admitted to to the fault.", "1 As you should.\n\n\n2 & 3 Again, you don't seem to understand how the courts work. Call the police if you believe she is doing something illegal. Suing  won't put her in jail, but it can have the court order the images removal.\n\n\nYou shouting \"I'm going to sue!\" isn't as intimidating or easy as you seem to think it is. I'm not trying to be a dick, just asking you to temper your expectations. The other commentor gave some great advice, likely even better than suing."]}
