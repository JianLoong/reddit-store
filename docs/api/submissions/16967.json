Our custody agreement was that our son would stay a month with me and one with her. When the pandemic started our son moved in with his mom because she lives in a house with a garden. During that time we talked on the phone a lot and I\u2019d pick him up on weekends. \n\nHe started uni in april and moved back in with me for that as it\u2019s closer for him. I don\u2019t expect him to pay rent but he is supposed to help in the household. Not excessively but picking up after himself and keeping his room clean. \n\nLast October, my girlfriend of 3 years and her daughter, who is 5, moved in with me. My son didn\u2019t have a problem with that when he decided to move here. Most days my son has uni until about 4 p.m. and will come home, make himself food and then go to his room to study or go out with friends. The problem is that he often leaves a mess in the kitchen. \n\nI told my girlfriend not to clean up after him as he is old enough to do that himself but she still does it sometimes when she needs to use the dishes. I get home around 6 p.m. and if I see that there is still a mess, I will confront him about it. He usually grumbles a bit but eventually cleans it up. \n\nYesterday I came home to find the kitchen in absolute chaos and my girlfriend close to tears in the living room. When I asked what happened she told me my son had once again made himself something to eat but left everything he used out. \n\nThis time she\u2019d been in a hurry as she wanted to make her daughter a quick lunch before dropping her off at a birthday party and didn\u2019t have time to clean up first. When she asked my son if he could put his used dishes away he apparently got angry and told her to \u201cfuck off\u201d. He used a few more words that I don\u2019t want to translate and ended up shutting the door in her face.\n\nI went to his room to confront him and he again told me to leave him alone. We had a fight and I told him if he wanted to keep living here he had to show some respect not only by cleaning up after himself but also in the way he talked to my girlfriend. He then left to stay with a friend but not before calling me an asshole and I haven\u2019t heard from him since.\n\nPart of me is thinking I shouldn\u2019t let him move back because of his behavior but on the other hand, he is my son and it\u2019s very difficult to find a place to live right now, especially for students. \n\nSo reddit, aita?", "created_utc": 1683813429, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13eo62k/aita_for_telling_my_son_he_has_to_be_respectful/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your son should be expected to clean up, and the way this was communicated was not unreasonable.\n\nBut I feel like there is more to the story...", "NTA, he's living rent free. If he doesn't like the rules he can leave. As well, cleaning up the kitchen after using it isn't a strict rule or a huge implication on him, he's likely not adhering to that rule as a power play. If he's old enough to attend university he's old enough to learn they're consequences to his actions.", "All of this just because he didn't clean up after himself?\n\nI feel like a lot more is being left out than what is in the post", "NTA. The very minor demands your placing on him are the bare minimum most people naturally hold themselves to", "NTA.  Common decency and respect in your home is not too much to ask.  It sounds like you ask very little of him and he refuses to do even that.  If he can't act like an adult and respect your home and your rules, he can go \"adult\" somewhere else.  Do not feel bad, he needs to grow up!", "NTA - if he lived in a flat with roommates, he\u2019d be expected to clean up after himself as well. Sounds like mommy pampered him WAY too much and he is unfortunately feeling some sense of entitlement. Also I am sure he resents your girlfriend and child.", "No, NTA.  I don't believe in throwing away bad kids and I'm sure 18 year old boys aren't always the best humans.  \n\nBut it seems he only has a problem with one thing.  Which is cleaning up after himself. Your girlfriend isn't a housekeeper and she sure as hell isn't HIS housekeeper.  \n\nDo you know if anything else is going on?  His reaction seemed more aggressive so is something else going on in his life?\n\nI can tell you that at 18 I moved out (for college) and never moved back home.  He is an adult and due to the nature of the parent/child relationship he may chafe at the rules you put in place but would be perfectly fine if he moved in with roommates who gave him the same rules.  \n\nUltimately I think you need to sit down and come up with a timeline and plan for him to move out.  Maybe you and your ex wife can help him with first, last and security deposit.  Maybe you and your ex can help him find a car of some sort so he can live further out and commute in. Help him polish up his resume to get a job. \n\nHelp him get out, but he needs to get out. If he doesn't it'll ruin your relationship.  \n\nGood luck.", "NTA\n\nYou are setting reasonable expectations and are generously letting him live there for free.

Whoever parented him around the kitchen did a lousy job. Unfortunately, it's still  common boys get raised with women cleaning up after them whatever they do. How has he acted in the past about clearing a space after food? Was he always expected to do so? Or is this a new thing?\n\nEscalating to threatening to kick him out was extreme, but then so was \"asshole\" & \"fuck off.\" Big red flags. Has he genuinely never learned to clean up after himself? That's.... odd. \n\nThis reads like there's got to be more to this, because who gets so hostile about such an easy thing to do? Just put stuff back in the fridge, etc. I wonder if he resents the girlfriend, because she gets to use the kitchen in a more casual way. She doesn't have to clean up immediately after herself. And since he's your blood, he feels justified in acting as entitled as she does how he wants in the kitchen. Are they pretty close in age? That may be another dynamic in this.... soup.\n\nI'd start looking into housing options for him. Do you want to spend the next 4 years locked in conflict?", "INFO: This doesn\u2019t seem right. There are missing details\u2026 so many missing details.\n\nIs this the first girlfriend you had who moved in?\n\nHas he always lacked the skills to clean up after himself?\n\nIs he only messy in the kitchen?\n\nWhen did you sit down and talk about expectations with your adult son?\n\nWhat have the interactions been like between your son and girlfriend? And between your son and her daughter?\n\nThere is something else that you\u2019ve left out. I can\u2019t say who is the AH - I don\u2019t have all the info. If I haven\u2019t asked the right question, please answer the question(s) you were hoping wouldn\u2019t be asked.", "NTA for confronting him about his uncalled-for rudeness toward your girlfriend and his inconsiderate habit of leaving a mess in shared spaces. \n\nBut I don't think taking the confrontation into  \"if you want to leave here...\" territory was necessary. I often wonder why it is that some parents tend to use house ownership and the fact a technically adult child is no longer entitled to live in their house as a lever. I mean, in some cases of extremely entitled or uncooperative children, maybe. \n\nBut your son's sins so far have been not cleaning up the kitchen a few times and being rude to your girlfriend once. Threatening to kick him out (and that's what you did) for that is an unnecessary escalation. And wondering if you made a mistake \"letting him\" move in?! Are you seriously prioritizing your girlfriend of 3 years over a couple tears because of a one-time cussing out... over your child having a safe and appropriate place to live while he completes his academical formation? Come on now.  \n\nI would require him to apologize for cussing out your girlfriend for no reason, and make sure he understands that the standards of cohabitating in your home demand that he cleans after himself, especially in the kitchen and other spaces shared by everyone. \n\nBut I'll also point out that this kid is 18. If he still hasn't picked up basic hygiene and organization habits, that's on you and his mother.", "His behavior is not okay but I would love to normalize people not seeing their children as disposable and their dating companions as the primary relationship. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, he was rude and lazy, as teens can be and they need to be corrected 100%.   But as a parent, why would you default to kicking your kid out because of a tussle with someone you are just dating therefor is by nature not yet permanent.  \n\nI just don\u2019t get this mindset.  Your kids are supposed to be the priority relationship.", "NTA but you gf is going to cry over your son cursing at her? Lol not saying your son isn\u2019t being disrespectful but I would say more teenagers leave a mess then don\u2019t, your kitchen would have to be destroyed if his mess was so bad that it prevented another person from throwing together a sandwich realistically.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Let him stay gone so your home can have some peace.", "NTA\n\nThis isn't even about your relationship with your girlfriend, or how he feels about her in particular, its about him needing to grow up, behave responsibly, and learn to be a decent human being when he is sharing a home with ANYONE.\n\nHe may feel entitled to be a slob because it's \"his dad's house\" but he's 18 and in university and about to be out on his own in the next few years. Whether he's living with you or not, he's going to be sharing space with other people, at a job or elsewhere, and he needs to learn how to do that respectfully.\n\nThe reality is that he may have taken off petulantly for a friend's place, but he's going to find out very quickly that his friends don't want him in their space for very long either if he's a slob who leaves his crap all over the kitchen and never cleans up after himself. You've been asking the bare minimum of him, and he's going to learn soon enough that it's exactly what any roommates are going to want of him as well . . . and if anything, they're likely to expect a lot more of him than just picking up after himself and not leaving his dishes and things everywhere.\n\nYou are NTA, and I won't be surprised if he's asking to come home within the next couple of weeks when his friends get tired of his not contributing financially and being a slob.", "NTA .

I can't imagine anything serious happening between them without one or the other telling me about it. It isn't like they're spending the whole day together. It's mostly just 2 to 3 hours until I get home and my son spends most of that time in his room. She does contribute to rent payments. I don't think our ages were relevant but my son is 18, my girlfriend is 27 and I'm 37.", "I'm actually surprised at his behavior because when he was staying with my he'd always do his chores and never talked to me this way when I reinded him.", "Yes, she's the first relationship that's serious enough for us to move in together. He's met her when he came over on weekends and there didn't seem to be any problems between them. He generally doesn't interact with her daughter much but I don't expect him too because they're so far apart in ages.\n\nBack when he stayed with me, he used to help me cook and also clean afterwards.

He\u2019s confronted him every time this has happened and told him he had to do better. Talking to him hasn\u2019t worked.

Nobody cares what *most teenagers do* but almost everyone cares when their kid calls them an asshole. Ntm telling another adult to \"fuck off\"  (any adult) is beyond disrespectful in his father's home. \n\nI don't like my kitchen to be messy when I start cooking...or when I walk in with groceries, or when I get up in the morning.

Your gf is closer in age to your son than you so he might not be as willing to listen to her/see her as an authority figure.\n\nThat said he\u2019s still out of line and it\u2019s good you\u2019re setting boundaries even though I don\u2019t think threatening to kick him out was the way to do that.

This is very normal behavior", "Did you talk to your son about them moving in before you did it?", ">He usually grumbles a bit but eventually cleans it up.\n\nThe son is responding to OP and doing what is expected of him. The issue isn't that the kid doesn't listen, the issue is that he has so far not corrected the bad habit of leaving a mess in the kitchen until his father asks him to take care of it. \n\nAlso, this confrontation wasn't so much about the cleaning as it was about being rude toward the girlfriend. This is correct to do, unless there's more to it that we don't know, telling the woman to fuck off was disrespectful and uncalled for. \n\nBut your reasoning is faulted in my opinion. You cannot parent a technically adult child (he's 18 and fresh out of high school, still a kid in a lot of ways) the same way you would if they were still kids, and you cannot decide they're adult for some thing s(like to live on their own if they don't abide your rules) but childish for others (like \"giving them repercussions\" when they don't perform to your expectation). \n\nOP should respect his son as a very young adult and demand respect for his home and the people that live in it, as any adult sharing a home would. And go from there. He can still parent his son (and sounds like he needs to, because he and his mother have failed to instill healthy living habits and basic respect for cohabitation in him). But \"do as I say or I'll kick you out\" is the wrong way to go, very authoritarian and closed-minded... an approach that hardly ever leads to good outcomes with teenagers.", "The kid didn\u2019t do his dishes and got mouthy.  This isn\u2019t a capital offense.  Idk, I just think people on this board jump to kicking their kids out but are willing to move in and support any yahoo off their street and the yahoo\u2019s kids.  And god forbid their actual child feel some sort of way about it.  I\u2019m sure people will disagree with me but that doesn\u2019t matter, at least my kids will talk to me when they are 40 because I didn\u2019t make them homeless", "Ah cool let\u2019s just makes everyone change their behavior and actions to revolve around you. Having kids and having your feeling being hurt on the drop of hat do not mix well together", "Ah yes, another talk with him because that\u2019s been working so well thus far. Of course the repercussion to being disrespectful and lazy when he\u2019s getting to live there rent-free is to tell him if he doesn\u2019t like the rules, he can leave. That would be the same consequence for any adult in that position, not just because he\u2019s OP\u2019s son."]}
