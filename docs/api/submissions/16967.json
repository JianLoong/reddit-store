Our custody agreement was that our son would stay a month with me and one with her. When the pandemic started our son moved in with his mom because she lives in a house with a garden. During that time we talked on the phone a lot and I\u2019d pick him up on weekends. \n\nHe started uni in april and moved back in with me for that as it\u2019s closer for him. I don\u2019t expect him to pay rent but he is supposed to help in the household. Not excessively but picking up after himself and keeping his room clean. \n\nLast October, my girlfriend of 3 years and her daughter, who is 5, moved in with me. My son didn\u2019t have a problem with that when he decided to move here. Most days my son has uni until about 4 p.m. and will come home, make himself food and then go to his room to study or go out with friends. The problem is that he often leaves a mess in the kitchen. \n\nI told my girlfriend not to clean up after him as he is old enough to do that himself but she still does it sometimes when she needs to use the dishes. I get home around 6 p.m. and if I see that there is still a mess, I will confront him about it. He usually grumbles a bit but eventually cleans it up. \n\nYesterday I came home to find the kitchen in absolute chaos and my girlfriend close to tears in the living room. When I asked what happened she told me my son had once again made himself something to eat but left everything he used out. \n\nThis time she\u2019d been in a hurry as she wanted to make her daughter a quick lunch before dropping her off at a birthday party and didn\u2019t have time to clean up first. When she asked my son if he could put his used dishes away he apparently got angry and told her to \u201cfuck off\u201d. He used a few more words that I don\u2019t want to translate and ended up shutting the door in her face.\n\nI went to his room to confront him and he again told me to leave him alone. We had a fight and I told him if he wanted to keep living here he had to show some respect not only by cleaning up after himself but also in the way he talked to my girlfriend. He then left to stay with a friend but not before calling me an asshole and I haven\u2019t heard from him since.\n\nPart of me is thinking I shouldn\u2019t let him move back because of his behavior but on the other hand, he is my son and it\u2019s very difficult to find a place to live right now, especially for students. \n\nSo reddit, aita?", "created_utc": 1683813429, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13eo62k/aita_for_telling_my_son_he_has_to_be_respectful/", "score": 2698, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your son should be expected to clean up, and the way this was communicated was not unreasonable.\n\nBut I feel like there is more to the story...\n\nEdit: I was clear that I think OP is NTA, right? Lots of shade being thrown for being curious as to whether this is more than just a jerk teenager.", "NTA, he's living rent free. If he doesn't like the rules he can leave. As well, cleaning up the kitchen after using it isn't a strict rule or a huge implication on him, he's likely not adhering to that rule as a power play. If he's old enough to attend university he's old enough to learn there are consequences to his actions.", "All of this just because he didn't clean up after himself?\n\nI feel like a lot more is being left out than what is in the post", "NTA. The very minor demands your placing on him are the bare minimum most people naturally hold themselves to", "NTA.  Common decency and respect in your home is not too much to ask.  It sounds like you ask very little of him and he refuses to do even that.  If he can't act like an adult and respect your home and your rules, he can go \"adult\" somewhere else.  Do not feel bad, he needs to grow up!", "NTA - if he lived in a flat with roommates, he\u2019d be expected to clean up after himself as well. Sounds like mommy pampered him WAY too much and he is unfortunately feeling some sense of entitlement. Also I am sure he resents your girlfriend and child.", "No, NTA.  I don't believe in throwing away bad kids and I'm sure 18 year old boys aren't always the best humans.  \n\nBut it seems he only has a problem with one thing.  Which is cleaning up after himself. Your girlfriend isn't a housekeeper and she sure as hell isn't HIS housekeeper.  \n\nDo you know if anything else is going on?  His reaction seemed more aggressive so is something else going on in his life?\n\nI can tell you that at 18 I moved out (for college) and never moved back home.  He is an adult and due to the nature of the parent/child relationship he may chafe at the rules you put in place but would be perfectly fine if he moved in with roommates who gave him the same rules.  \n\nUltimately I think you need to sit down and come up with a timeline and plan for him to move out.  Maybe you and your ex wife can help him with first, last and security deposit.  Maybe you and your ex can help him find a car of some sort so he can live further out and commute in. Help him polish up his resume to get a job. \n\nHelp him get out, but he needs to get out.

Whoever parented him around the kitchen did a lousy job. Unfortunately, it's still  common boys get raised with women cleaning up after them whatever they do. How has he acted in the past about clearing a space after food? Was he always expected to do so? Or is this a new thing?\n\nEscalating to threatening to kick him out was extreme, but then so was \"asshole\" & \"fuck off.\" Big red flags. Has he genuinely never learned to clean up after himself? That's.... odd. \n\nThis reads like there's got to be more to this, because who gets so hostile about such an easy thing to do? Just put stuff back in the fridge, etc. I wonder if he resents the girlfriend, because she gets to use the kitchen in a more casual way. She doesn't have to clean up immediately after herself. And since he's your blood, he feels justified in acting as entitled as she does how he wants in the kitchen. Are they pretty close in age? That may be another dynamic in this.... soup.\n\nI'd start looking into housing options for him. Do you want to spend the next 4 years locked in conflict?", "INFO: This doesn\u2019t seem right.

And between your son and her daughter?\n\nThere is something else that you\u2019ve left out. I can\u2019t say who is the AH - I don\u2019t have all the info.

I often wonder why it is that some parents tend to use house ownership and the fact a technically adult child is no longer entitled to live in their house as a lever. I mean, in some cases of extremely entitled or uncooperative children, maybe. \n\nBut your son's sins so far have been not cleaning up the kitchen a few times and being rude to your girlfriend once. Threatening to kick him out (and that's what you did) for that is an unnecessary escalation. And wondering if you made a mistake \"letting him\" move in?! Are you seriously prioritizing your girlfriend of 3 years over a couple tears because of a one-time cussing out... over your child having a safe and appropriate place to live while he completes his academical formation? Come on now.  \n\nI would require him to apologize for cussing out your girlfriend for no reason, and make sure he understands that the standards of cohabitating in your home demand that he cleans after himself, especially in the kitchen and other spaces shared by everyone. \n\nBut I'll also point out that this kid is 18. If he still hasn't picked up basic hygiene and organization habits, that's on you and his mother.", "His behavior is not okay but I would love to normalize people not seeing their children as disposable and their dating companions as the primary relationship. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, he was rude and lazy, as teens can be and they need to be corrected 100%.   But as a parent, why would you default to kicking your kid out because of a tussle with someone you are just dating therefor is by nature not yet permanent.  \n\nI just don\u2019t get this mindset.  Your kids are supposed to be the priority relationship.", "NTA but you gf is going to cry over your son cursing at her? Lol not saying your son isn\u2019t being disrespectful but I would say more teenagers leave a mess then don\u2019t, your kitchen would have to be destroyed if his mess was so bad that it prevented another person from throwing together a sandwich realistically.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The issue isn't that the kid doesn't listen, the issue is that he has so far not corrected the bad habit of leaving a mess in the kitchen until his father asks him to take care of it. \n\nAlso, this confrontation wasn't so much about the cleaning as it was about being rude toward the girlfriend. This is correct to do, unless there's more to it that we don't know, telling the woman to fuck off was disrespectful and uncalled for. \n\nBut your reasoning is faulted in my opinion. You cannot parent a technically adult child (he's 18 and fresh out of high school, still a kid in a lot of ways) the same way you would if they were still kids, and you cannot decide they're adult for some thing s(like to live on their own if they don't abide your rules) but childish for others (like \"giving them repercussions\" when they don't perform to your expectation). \n\nOP should respect his son as a very young adult and demand respect for his home and the people that live in it, as any adult sharing a home would. And go from there. He can still parent his son (and sounds like he needs to, because he and his mother have failed to instill healthy living habits and basic respect for cohabitation in him).

He may have had an off/bad day and was going to snap at whoever talked to him next and she was the unfortunate recipient of that. It may be that he has issues seeing her as an authority figure. It may be that he's indeed a spoiled teen boy baby that views her as a glorified maid. Whatever the case is you need to communicate with your son and find out why he thought that the response he gave her was the appropriate one. \nWhile an explanation is not an excuse, one is still needed, and it should be addressed whatever it is. \nIf there's something going on that makes him resent her then you need to talk to him about it and, no matter if it's his or her fault, try to rectify it. If he had a bad day and went off on her because she was the unfortunate one to accidentally poke the bear you need to talk to him about it and attempt to make it clear you don't snap at people that have nothing to do with why you're angry no matter who they are.

You can try a clear, concise conversation regarding normal / expected standards of cleanliness in the common and shared areas, both what he expects and what you / GF expect, how adult communication should go if expectations are not being met, etc. He is legally an adult - but likely has ZERO awareness of how adult roommate situations go, which is also muddied as you have a parent-child relationship and a step-parent-to-step-child relationship. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegarding the relationship issue - that is tricky. Do you expect him to communicate with you and your GF as a child, or as a young (still learning) adult? Like, are you communicating it as a \"you are my child, I deserve an immediate response and subservient communication styles from you and so does my GF\", or are you phrasing it clearly as \"Hey, we are all adults. If I politely ask you, as an adult, for roommate courtesies, and you react like a rebellious teenager being 'told' what to do, that is not a sustainable pattern of communication for any of us long-term.\" As others have mentioned - he is acting out, and there could be any number of reasons for it. Pandemic social delays, adjustment to the reality of sharing a living space with two adults when he only grudgingly views you as an 'authority' and may want to ignore your GF's existence (especially if he has latent resentment for feeling cheated of your attention in previous years due to logistics), etc. He also could just be acting like an immature AH for no external reason at all...which he will hopefully grow out of, but may not.   \n\n\nGood luck, NTA for now, based on the information included - could change depending on how you choose to handle the next available conversation.

Sit down with him outside the house and your gf (a park with a table perhaps) and have this conversation with him.\n\nTell him you love him, and you need to give him some information about his future.  Ask him if he understands that picking up after yourself is and adult responsibility.  If he's claiming adulthood mommy and daddy don't wipe your butt for you, you to that for yourself.  Point out that he likely doesn't want to live with you or his mom for the rest of his life, and its highly likely his first independent living (outside of dorms) is going to be with roommates.\n\nDescribe the behavior he's doing about using the shared spaces and not cleaning up, time and time again, then point out that its a situation where its his *roommate* that is doing it, and your son has to clean if he wants any dishes at all.

For me that means he\u2019s not from states and just so you all from states know some other countries made it a law for parents to provide for their kids until they finish their education or until they are 26 years old and studying. So op might be legally required to provide for his son. \nPandemic hit everyone. And the kids/teenagers had it more tough with no opportunities to grow up. Check the studies, ask the teachers. There is a problem created by it. \nOp said that son stayed with his mom. So how much did op provided during the 3 years that he stayed there? Just because son is now adult doesn\u2019t mean op should not provide passed dues. \nI also find it convenient that when op had more free time (no kid to parent) he found himself a new girlfriend. How much time op you spend talking to your son on the phone and how much with the new gf? \nNow, he lived with you first then after for her to move in. Did he spend the time alone in his room back then or in the living room. How much space her kid is taking? If there is a conflict do you expect him to yield because \u201che\u2019s an adult\u201d? Also how much time you spend with your son and how much with the \u201cnew family\u201d. Do you have father-son time alone or are the two of them always tagging in. Do you even want to spend time with him? \nHe spent 3 years at home with online school. Now he\u2019s in the fist year of uni. Probably commuting, with all the new stuff to learn, different dynamics. He comes back from this tired, still fixes himself something to eat and just wants to rest for a little bit and recharge. If you leave the stuff in kitchen does he do it later?

Do you clean afterwards immediately?\nAnd now to your hero complex. You see a \u201cdamsel in distress\u201d, one that you also have sex with, listen to her cry story how your son called her mean words and what? You are obviously immediately biased against him and go to confront him. Not talk! Confront! Obviously he will not want to talk to you like it. You wouldn\u2019t be really listening to him. \nAnd honestly how much of an adult you were when your son was born op? Because he that age now. We\u2019re you so put together? Maybe try to see it from your son\u2019s perspective?\nNow moving on to your gf. I doubt she tries to parent him. But how is she behaving? Is she telling/demanding him to do something or asking? And I mean generally not only about cleaning the kitchen. Does she behave like on the same level as you or him? \nYou said she\u2019s working part time. Does it mean she can prepare the lunch at different time, but continuously do it after he comes back from school? \nYou said she wanted to make quick lunch because her kid was supposed to go to birthday party. I\u2019m not sure what parties you had, but generally they feed the kids. Girlfriend if she wanted could  order something in or eat out before the party. I also find it unlikely that your son used ALL kitchen appliances, so for quick lunch she definitely could have make something. \nShe had options. But you know what she chose? To be \u201cdamsel in distress\u201d and cry. She\u2019s decade older then him, with a kid, yet everyone here suddenly expects him to be the adult, but she can behave like a kid. She chose the worst option, unless\u2026 she knew you were coming and her tears obviously works. \n\nOP it\u2019s not about the kitchen. Maybe instead of pointing at your son you start looking at yourself first? And TALK to him not confront. Find a time and space to do it. Without any \u201cmore pressing issues\u201d, without your gf and her kid to interrupt you. Ask him what\u2019s going on, why the change. Be a parent you were supposed to be the last 3 years!\n\nAnd yes son is ah here.

He needs to be taught and modeled boundaries. Which means talking about why those boundaries are important and how they affect others. A huge part of talking about boundaries is talking about empathy.

That is what needs to be directly addressed.\n\nAnd it also is less helpful to \"confront\" him than it is to ask him what's going on and why he's doing this. He already knows he isn't supposed to be doing this, so confronting him about that won't make a difference. It's not about whether you're approaching this like an asshole or not, and you're not, but rather about whether your approach is actually going to make a difference and produce a positive result for everybody involved. Communicate more. If he is angry at you for not being in his life as much over the years, or about you having a new romantic partner, even if you didn't do anything wrong, just let him get that out and process that with you. Listen and show him that you're glad that he felt he could open up to you about those difficult emotions. Childhood feelings about abandonment aren't always logical, so don't take them personally, and keeping all those feelings inside often leads to behavior like this. Just being able to get it out and have you listen and care might make a big difference. IF that is the issue.
