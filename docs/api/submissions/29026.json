You deserve a romantic cruise alone, and your nephew wishes are not your responsability. He would need an adult all the time taking care of him so he would not get lost or into trouble.\n\nI think your MIL only want you two to take him so she doesn't have to listen to your SIL complaining. Bet your in laws are used to pay so she stop bothering.", "NTA why do they think they're entitled to you acting like a babysitter for a week!? It's so bizarre.", "NTA. A romantic getaway in no way equals watching an 11 year old. She also brought up money in a shaming way by accusing y'all of flexing.", "NTA. Even aside from money, that's a ridiculous request. What young couple wants a little boy along on a romantic vacation? Answer? None. Let them rant and rave.", "Hard NTA.\n\nThey spoil that kid. And now they\u2019re expecting y\u2019all to spoil him too and take him on the cruise and babysit him. How entitled of them to even suggest y\u2019all take him on your romantic getaway. The audacity. I\u2019m very glad you nipped that idea in the bud.", "NTA. I would also book an adults only cruise so no kids are even allowed to be on board.", "Imagine being that entitled that when you hear about a family member going on a trip your first thought is \"oh good you can take so-and-so with you\" LOL. NTA, your sister is ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nHe has his whole life to save up for a cruise and go for himself.  This is a romantic get away, not a shitty Make A ~~wish~~ Casual Curiosity Foundation project.", "Nta.\nNot your child if you don't like the little fella you don't have to care about his wishes you are not his parents\nAbout the financial stuff: major skill issue on their side for spoiling the kid", "AITA entertainment at its best. The weird entitlement many people seem to have is always a reason to smile. NTA OP, your boyfriend\u2019s sister is delusional. Enjoy your trip!", "ESH\nAt first I was going to say not you, but then you got all nasty and personal with them. \nSounds like you guys hang out just to fight", "NTA... What part of romantic does MIL not understand? A child - one who is argumentative and does not like the people he is with - is a surefire way to kill all romance. The entire trip will become one big exercise in being responsible for a child. For me - if I am out with my own child, it is stressful enough to ensure they are safe at all times. But another person's child - the stress multiplies because I feel the sense of responsibility more intensely. At this point why spend money and go on a cruise - just babysit him in your apartment and all be miserable!!! That way at least you save the cruise money!!", "NTA. A romantic cruise does not include babysitting.", "NTA. Its a romantic cruise, 11yr olds do not belong on their uncles romantic cruise.\n\nIf the family won't stop badgering you, tell them you will take him but it will cost. The cost being you and your BF cruise costs, plus daily charges for baby sitting, that double for watching him on a night. Also any excursion and food costs on top.", "NTA\n\nExpecting you and your boyfriend to take your nephew on a vacation is absurd.\n\nIf your MiL is so willing to pay for your nephew to go on a trip, why doesn't *she* take him on a cruise? Or pay for his mother to take him on one?", "Basically SIL and MIL just asked you and bf to be babysitters for free for this kid for a week.\n\nNTA", "NTA. What kind of person tries to invite their kid onto someone else\u2019s cruise? So basically they want a vacation away from their kid.", "NTA - it\u2019s a romantic cruise not a week of free babysitting. How selfish is his family. It\u2019s just not appropriate for that type of trip and the entitlement to expect you to pay for it too.", "NTA. It will actually hurt you if you take him along, it will hurt your relationship, your time away and alone with each other. You will have to constantly supervise, you cannot go anywhere where children are not allowed, you will have to cater to his interests and age. \n\nI am flabbergasted why is this even a discussion in your family. I understand if it was a beloved relative's child that is old enough to have some sort of independence (let's say 15 years old) and you know you can rely on them having less supervision and still be okay. But this is not the case on so many levels.\n\n\"He always wanted to go on a cruise\" - great, this means your SIL and her husband can make this a family vacation planned for next year, save money and go all together. The way that you planned and used your savings.", "NTA, you can't have a romantic holiday with an 11 year old tagging along, even worse is someone else's kid joining you.\n\nOP you should show all these replies to MIL and SIL if they continue to harass you.", "Your BF's sister is deranged. Obviously your nephew has no place on a romantic cruise for two 20-somethings. Hold your ground. They're completely absurd for even contemplating this. NTA", "NTA. doesn\u2019t even matter what type of holiday it is, you said no and that should be the end of it. I\u2019m going on a cruise soon with my boyfriend and I know my nephew would love to go (he told me and jokingly asked to join when he was told about it) but he accepted no to his joke request to join. I love my nephew and he\u2019s an awesome kid, I just don\u2019t want to take him on a cruise and nobody expected me to", "You can't actually think you're the AH here, right? This is just for validation?\n\nWell, you get it. Absolutely NTA. Of course you would not bring your 11-year-old nephew along on a romantic cruise.\n\nIf your MIL wants him to have the experience, she should offer to send him with (at least one of) his parents--as long as it's a different cruise from yours!\n\n(Don't tell them the details. Seriously.)", "*\"saying that her son (11m) has always wanted to go on a cruise\"*\n\nNo - she wants him to go on a cruise that she isn't paying for so she can be kid free for a week.\n\n*\"My MIL later called us to offer to pay for his ticket, but we still refused and at that point she also got upset, saying that we should let my nephew experience this opportunity\"*\n\nMIL wants him to go and will pay for him, so the reason MIL isn't going to take him is........?", "Tell MIL to take the kid on a cruise.   NTA", "That kid is going to grow up into an entitled A-hole thanks to his parents. SHM. NTAH", "NTA, it is really saying something that everyone wants him to go but doesn't want to take him.", "I knew this was a NTA one sentence in and I'm still very much of that opinion. \n\nThis is a *romantic cruise*, there is no place in that for a kid that isn't even yours and that you didn't invite.", "NTA. I would not even discuss this further. No is no.", "NTA. It's a romantic cruise, which does not mean a child who is not even yours should tag along. It's not just about the cost, it's about keeping him amused and entertained on the cruise. Excursions you want to do may not be interesting or appropriate for a child.", "\"No\" is a complete sentence.  Not your responsibility.  BF's sister and mother are acting really entitled to expect that you should take an 11-year-old along on your romantic cruise for two.  Sounds like his sister has the money to do other things but was looking for a freebie.  She should manage her money better and then take the kid herself on a cruise.", "Yeah that's what I think too, alongside her habit of making my nephew want for nothing. She expects everyone to do the same probably", "Since he is the only grandchild of my inlaws and the only child of my SIL, he gets spoiled rotten. I'm assuming they expect us to cater to his every need just like they do", "It isn't even the first time she tries to make us feel bad because we have savings", "Basically yes, although I think it's more like about expecting us to take care of his every wish like they do", "Honestly? I wouldn't have taken him, even if he had been 18. We are going out on a romantic getaway, not on a family vacation", "Tbh yes, it was just to make sure I'm not completely crazy to think that this situation is ridiculous", "Bingo. The parents want a week away from the brat they created and keep enabling. The nephew has \"always wanted\" to go on a cruise? Great! He's freaking 11 years old, he has plenty of time in his life to go on a cruise with his own parents or, later in life, that he pays for himself. I'm 43 years old and have wanted to go on a cruise my whole life, but have I? No, because I can't afford it. Still on the bucket list, though. \n\nNTA.", "To be honest, seeing her life from up close is crazy. Seeing this woman dressed head to toe in designer clothes beg for money to pay the bills feels almost like a dystopia.", "Definitely NTA. Stay firm, do not take him and enjoy your romantic cruise.  Whoever heard of a romantic cruise with someone else's 11 year old along for ride. Just No.", "Entirely valid!", "You're not. They're bonkers."]}
