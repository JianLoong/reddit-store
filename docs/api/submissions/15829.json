I\u2019m a very deep sleeper, and we\u2019ve added a rain machine to help us fall asleep in our room, and it\u2019s true I hadn\u2019t heard him, so I apologized and started putting on my clothes to go with him to the doctor.\n\nHe was so angry and yelling, and he put his clothes on and left, to which I assumed was the doctors. When he\u2019s in a bad mood or angry he yells, regardless of if his throat hurts. He gets angry and then just doesn\u2019t feel anything pain wise. I didn\u2019t want to have that happen in public or in a doctors office because it\u2019s embarrassing and no one wants to see that. So I waited until he messaged me.\n\nI started cleaning the apartment because I figured if he didn\u2019t want me there, I could clean up and make sure there wasn\u2019t a huge mess for him to come home to.\n\nHe messaged me about an hour later saying that he hopes I was enjoying my day off with him in the hospital, and me watching tv. I told him I was cleaning for when he got home, and that I wasn\u2019t watching tv ignoring his situation. I asked him if he wanted me to come meet him there and he told me no- he didn\u2019t want me near him. \n\nSo I gave him his space, apologized for not hearing him this morning and told him to let me know if he changed his mind because I was already dressed and ready to go. \n\nHere\u2019s where I think I was the AH. He messaged me later saying he was getting his throat frozen and a few needles, which he hates. He said he wouldn\u2019t forgive me for not being there for him, and then stopped responding. I didn\u2019t know how long he\u2019d be there as it would take me 20 mins to get there, and assumed he\u2019d be done by then.

He said all I wanted to do was sleep, watch tv and smoke weed (were in Canada where it\u2019s legal). And yes I do smoke. \n\nHe\u2019s now locked himself in the bedroom, won\u2019t speak to me and told me to get out. I don\u2019t know what to even do at this point.

In normal circumstances, I would say that going with your partner to the hospital should be a no-brainer, even if they say they don't need you to. \n\nBut this guy woke you up by yelling and blaming you for something you did not fault in (you didn't ignore him, you simply didn't hear him), then stormed out without you, without saying where he was going. While you guessed correctly that he was at hospital, his history of yelling at you in public made you think it would be best if you stayed and tried to ease his day in a different way. That's not the same as saying \"meh, I don't wanna go\". \n\nPlus, he continued to berate you the entire time, and expressly said he did not want you to go there when you asked and offered. He doesn't get to be mad at you because you did exactly what he said he wanted you to do. There's no clearer sign of emotional manipulation and horrible communication, than your typical \"well I know what I said but you should've known what I actually meant\". Fuck that. \n\nYou're not an asshole, you did not deserve him treating you as a punch bag to mitigate his throat pain, and you need to seriously think if this is the kind of person you want to spend your life with.

You should rethink the relationship, especially if you're used to this behavior from him.", "Adding some more info:\n\nWe\u2019ve been together 10 years this coming summer. I\u2019m 32 and he\u2019s 34. He started school this past September, while I\u2019ve been working full time. He got osap but that mostly just covered tuition while I\u2019ve been paying for most of the bills. And we live in Toronto so rent isn\u2019t exactly cheap.\n\nWhen we first got together I had really bad anxiety which I was medicated for. I couldn\u2019t leave the house without throwing up for a half hour. I didn\u2019t work for almost the first year of us dating. Like I would get jobs, but they wouldn\u2019t last long because I didn\u2019t know how to deal with my anxiety.

Like yes I cleaned the house, did laundry, made food, but I wasn\u2019t contributing money wise and I get that\u2019s stressful. He had to do some shitty stuff to help get us by, and I\u2019ve always been thankful for that and told him so. But when he\u2019s been angry he\u2019s said that I \u2018used him\u2019 and \u2018drained his account\u2019 so I wouldn\u2019t have to work.

Instead of yelling for you, why didn't he just come in the room & wake you up?

You are NTA, but you need to do some thinking, because you really shouldn't be treated like this.

My husband drove me. I was admitted and stayed for several days. My dad helped out by bringing me a bag of my clothes from home and my computer and stuff. (We had just gotten a dog from the shelter the prior weekend and it was less disruptive to have my husband stay home with the dog and kid, vs my dad having to supervise a confused and unfamiliar dog.) \n\nEventually, I was discharged and my husband and kid came to pick me up. They even brought the dog, who was very excited to see me. It was a happy reunion for everybody. It was good to be home. I was very grateful to have such a nice and supportive family. \n\nWhat I have just described is normal. (All except the part where I waited too long to get medical treatment, that was stupid.) It\u2019s a good relationship between two adults who treat each other with kindness and respect.

Hell, my husband had to massage my throat to help me swallow the medicine I needed.  If your partner was well enough to scream at you, and well enough to leave on his own, he was well enough to walk to the bedroom, wake you gently, and ask for help like a loving partner and not a jerk.\n\n2) Being at the hospital alone and scared sucks.  Waiting and waiting for someone to come sucks.  Knowing that your partner knows where you are and knows you want them to come, but they won't come? That sucks.\n\n3) Even though he texted and expressed anger and hurt that you did not go to the hospital to be with him, he doesn't have the right to expect that anymore.

You can't help someone who treats you like the enemy. From the sounds of it that isn't something new since you said he yells when he's angry.

Beyond that you are dealing with one of two possibilities.  This may be a case that relates to that quote, and he is upset, feeling a bit on his own with something that scared him, and now he is being overly dramatic.  He might even be feeling a little bad about having gone over the top, but that is probably the lesser than his feeling you should've done more to take care of him (though, again, there is nothing else you should have done).\n\nThe other possibility is that you're seeing a part of him that either hasn't been visible before, or that you've ignored.  That side is closely related to what I just described, but is a little deeper in terms of his personality.  Rather than a result of being scared by what is going on and wanting support, this is a sense of his feeling entitled and having an expectation that you should always know what is going on, and be able to respond and be responsible for his needs.\n\nThe first can cause issues, but is resolvable with calm communication.  That later is a major red flag.  You may already have an idea as to which this may be, but it sounds like you are doing everything you reasonably can do.", "Are you fucking this man?

I'm NOT saying that you yelling back is abuse but the idea is that the abused person is pushed so hard and long that they snap and then the abuser focuses on that, using the words expressed in emotional distress for leverage, and completely ignores any of the abuser's own negative behavior leading up to that moment.\n\nYou can think of the bully in the schoolyard, taunting some other kid until that kid finally reaches a breaking point and defensively punches the bully.
