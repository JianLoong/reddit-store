Initially I found that sexy, but now I can't ignore how uncomfortable it is:\n\n1.  The shower is a small corner stall, just big enough for one person to move comfortably.  I have to contort and manoeuvre my limbs to use the soap without accidentally elbowing her.\n\n2.  Half the time I'm freezing.  Obviously we have to alternate using the single shower head.  But she'll also take the detachable shower head to clean her privates or her hair for a good while, meanwhile I'm shivering.\n\n3.  Half the time the water is lava!  She sets the water at an ungodly high temperature.  I have to dart in and out under the shower head so that I don't \"burn\".  I get that there are perfectly valid biological reasons for why she sets the temperature so high, but in the meantime I'm a red lobster.\n\n4.  My lower back gets sore.  I have to brace my lower back so that I don't lean too far forward and get in my gf's way while she's lathering up.  But sometimes I'll lean too far backward and bump the cold glass wall behind me which somehow feels worse than putting my bum on an unexpectedly cold toilet seat.\n\n5.  The Waiting Part I.  I'm often done showering before her but she insists that I stay in the shower until she's also done.  So I'm cold while she finishes using the shower head.\n\n6.  The Waiting Part II.  I often dry myself off quicker than her but she insists that we leave the bathroom together.  I don't really mind this part as much to be honest, we can chat while I'm waiting.  But sometimes I've got shit to do.\n\nSo I communicated all the above points to my gf while making it clear that it's nothing personal against her, that it's just impractical to shower together.  She was receptive but visibly disappointed.  Since then I showered alone a couple of times and it was pure bliss.  It really improved my mood.\n\nBut recently she insisted that with some adjustments we can shower together again, so I played along in good faith and took a shower with her.\n\n1.  She set the shower to a lower temperature, but it was still too hot for me.  But any lower and it was too cold for her.\n\n2.  When she's using the detachable shower head she'll spray me occasionally to keep me warm.  But I'm being sprayed with lava.\n\n3.  That's it.\n\nAfterward she was all happy and acted as if all our problems are solved.  So I felt like an ass when I gently burst her bubble.  She didn't say anything negative but was clearly disappointed.  She acts as if I'm a cold hearted boyfriend for not at least trying to find solutions to shower together.  \n\nShe's right that I'm not trying to find solutions because in the short term I can't install a bigger stall with a second shower head.\n\nShe suggested that in the long term we prioritize renovating the bathroom, but I want to do the kitchen first because it'll make the rest of the house look nicer, we spend more time in the kitchen and it'll help increase the value of the house.  I was again met with silent disappointment.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678904919, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11s4u18/aita_for_wanting_to_shower_alone/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I get it's cute and fun but it's obviously not fun all the time. She's not respecting your wishes. Just tell her you are over it\n\nETA: Why do you need to find solutions for something you don't want to do? there is no reason to shower together. The solution can be that you do it once in a while, maybe once a month.", "NTA - I\u2019ll be honest with you here, I didn\u2019t read every single point you made on why you don\u2019t want to shower with her. Why? Because it doesn\u2019t matter. \n\nNot wanting to shower with someone is not something that needs to be justified by several reasons. If my partner said \u201cI would like to shower alone tonight\u201d - I would never try to persuade or pressure him to change his mind. No one should make you feel like you have to shower with them - that is crossing major boundaries and is extending into borderline sexual coercion territory.", "Showers together are one of those things that\u2019s far better In romantic movies and books than in real life. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for wanting to shower separately, but long term you may need to find another way to feed that kind of romantic notion of togetherness your partner seems to want. NTA", "NTA nope stage 5 clinger, I need a moment alone.", "NTA. hopefully this doesn't sound too dramatic for the situation, but frankly it's creepy how insistent your girlfriend is about this. you didn't even need to provide all those justifications, just saying you don't want to should be enough for her to accept your answer with good grace and without being pissy about it, for lack of a better word. is she always this controlling or does she just have some weird thing about showers?", "NTA. You are entitled to take showers alone if you want to. I wouldn't want to take a shower with my partner every day either - maybe it's fun once in awhile, but every day for just regular hygiene showers? That would be weird and annoying. Google \"SNL Love Toilet\" and make her watch it!", "The only time I showered with my bf (now husband) regularly was when we both needed to get out of the house at the same time and didn't want to sacrifice our lie in. One soaped while the other rinsed. But whenever we weren't in a rush we'd shower alone. \n\n\nWhat possible compelling reason could she have to do it every time?", "NTA. I think she needs to look into why she can\u2019t shower alone & get that dealt with. It\u2019s not fair to you. You **did** try to find solutions, but they didn\u2019t work. Renovating the bathroom so y\u2019all can both fit just seems extreme.", "NTA. If you aren't having sex or trying to save water, there is zero reason to share the shower. Info: Is your gf clingy in other ways? Btw using the word clingy here because I have zero idea what to call her behavior.", "NTA\n\nPersonally I'm not sure *why* you would want to shower with someone: If you're showering that means you're dirty and you're working on being not dirty...that's neither here or there, though. You gave very simple and solid reasons as to why you don't want to until you can afford a bigger shower.\n\nShe may be a bit disappointed but I'm sure she'll understand.", "NTA\n\nYour gf is prioritising her own needs over yours and gaslighting your concerns. Let that be all the red flags you need when considering your future together...", "NTA! This is\u2026very strange. Does she have some kind of phobia? Is she worried you\u2019re jerking off in there? Regardless, that is a batshit crazy demand/request.", "NTA.  You're in the shower to wash, not as a \"togetherness\" exercise.  If you're not having sex in there, then showering separately makes sense.  Your girlfriend's insistence is very odd.", "NTA. It's okay to want to shower alone. I don't honestly get why this is such a big deal for your gf. With all due respect, she needs to just accept that you shower separately. If she can't do that then...odd hill to die on imo.", "NTA and your gf may need therapy. Something off and desperately needy about this", "NTA, she sounds pretty obnoxious. What can it bring to your relationship if you do what she wants but hate it?", "NTA\n\nNo means no in this context as well. You don\u2019t need to list out reasons.\n\nYou do not need to shower together. You do not want to shower together. Don\u2019t shower together.", "NTA.  \n\nI had a boyfriend who always wanted to shower every single shower together and I like to shower alone.  \n\nMy solution was to insist on showering alone for everyday showers and join him every once in awhile for sexy showers.", "Reading this your girlfriend gave me a pain my own ass and I don't even know her \ud83e\udd23 She sounds seriously annoying, someone this needy would be a deal breaker for me for sure.  Talk about smothering someone, is that a red flag? I know that gets thrown around a bit but it's incredibly suffocating behaviour.  Definitely NTA", "Nope. Sharing showers is not the life for me. And it\u2019s weird for her to be so pushy about it. NTA.", "NTA- Shower time is my time to boil myself while I let the day's bullshit wash down the drain. I don't want to share my shower time with someone unless it's a special occasion. Add in your issues with showering with her and this is just not a sustainable measure. There was a study done that women run hotter than men which is why they like their showers/bath water to be hotter than the fires of Hades.", "NTA - Just say no.", "NTA - sounds like she's a little too clingy.

Showers together on an every day basis are just not practical IMO.", "Nta, sometimes people just want privacy, even from their favourite person", "Is said showering together actually foreplay?  If so, sometimes you just have to do what you gotta do. If not - it's a bit much to ask. \n\nNTA either way.", "NTA, my girlfriend was the same way", "Sounds very needy and clingy. My infatuation would wear off quickly and this relationship would not last for me. Think about if this how you want to spend the rest of your life??  Might be time to end this. If not keep working until you find that compromise", "Nta. Sharing a shower is so frustrating. My bf and I used to try for shower sexy time but it's just awful and water doesn't make a good lubricant. It's not an ah thing to want to shower together less", "NTA she sounds exhausting TBH", "I didn't read your whole post either. Don't lose your showertime glory for any reason. Use shower with her only when sex is involved.", "NTA\n\nAs the women in this scenario I completely understand. It takes forever for me to get the conditioner out of my hair. I know for a fact I take way longer, I have more steps than my partner. Its fun every once in a while but I know I even want some alone showers. Those full out women showers people talk about where we shave everything and deep condition are very real and I like to be alone and listen to a podcast", "NTA. Make her a deal. You\u2019ll do 1 shower with her, maybe as many as 3, but with the \u201cpower\u201d dynamic in the shower switched. You get to set the temperature. You get to take the detachable showerhead and use it on yourself for a good long time, but she doesn\u2019t. (If that means her hair, etc doesn\u2019t get properly washed and rinsed, she can do that after you step out.) She does all the contortions necessary for you both sharing the space, instead of you maneuvering and bracing. The shower is done when you say it\u2019s done. Drying is done when you say it\u2019s done. Then see how she likes it.\n\nI understand happy, fun, sexy time showers, but your gf is being weird and unreasonable about this. I think that somehow, somewhere she has come to think of showering together all the time even to the point of having to step out of the shower and then out of the bathroom together as a symbol or indication of a good, close committed relationship. Maybe you need to talk to her about what\u2019s really going on.", "NTA. Me and my partner book hotels and airbnbs with big showers and it makes it a special thing. Showers together all the time is impractical", "INFO: Why is she so adamant about showering together? Regardless of the answer, NTA.", "NTA - you should start peeing in the shower while she\u2019s in there with you\u2026maybe that\u2019ll give her the hint.", "NTA some things are private.  I don\u2019t think wanting to shower alone is unreasonable. I\u2019m a bit of a germaphobe and if I\u2019m cleaning myself next to someone who hasn\u2019t cleaned yet, I\u2019d feel like I\u2019d have to shower again.", "NTA- my husband and I occasionally take a shower together but we have found a double headed shower head so no one freezes. He sets the temp because Though I like my shower hot He doesn't and I wont freeze at his water temp. \nBut, most the time we perfer our own showers. Perfectly normal not to shower together all the time.", "NTA. As others have said, showering together can be something fun and sexy when it\u2019s done occasionally, but for EVERY shower?? That\u2019s crazy. The fact that she\u2019s so clingy that you have to walk over the threshold together when you\u2019re done is\u2026 concerning. She needs to work out her clinginess issues and figure out why she can\u2019t stand time apart from you. A relationship CANNOT be healthy if you are together 24/7. Everyone needs at least some alone time and time away from your partner.", "NTA. Showering with a partner is nice only when both parties want to. It's not sexy if you end up in pain from needing to be a contortionist or alternately being frosted or scalded. Or if you just like your privacy. I have been known to take a long shower just to get me time away from kids. \n\nAlso. as one that has been in the position of needing to remodel both the bathroom and the kitchen, I agree with you on the kitchen remodel being higher priority and of more benefit to the daily living routines and entertaining of friends. Our bathroom was the last thing we remodeled in our house.", "NTA\n\nI don't enjoy showering with the partner. I just want to get clean and get out. You don't need anymore reasons.", "NTA at all -- why don't you move a chair into the bathroom and suggest you keep her company while she showers, chat to her etc, and in return you get to shower alone.\n\nIt would be a bit of a commitment -- yes, sometimes you do have shit to do -- but it would be a much better compromise than what's currently happening.", "NTA. I can't even comprehend this... I'm sorry but there are boundaries in a relationship and there are BOUNDARIES IN A RELATIONSHIP. Showering by yourself should be one!", "When did you start showering with my girlfriend? I swear it's a girl thing.", "NAH. She must like the romantic notion of it but doesn't understand how the logistics of it sucks.", "This is clearly her \"thing\". \n\nIf you put a list of things you want from a partner and you have say \"having coffee together every morning\" as number 5 in the priorities list, then it's fine if it doesn't always happen. \n\nBut this seems to be her NUMBER ONE thing. The compromise is to maybe do every other shower together or something? \n\nMaybe doing the bathroom first with two shower heads is the solution? You're prioritising the kitchen and usually that's fine - But you're doing it at the expense of the one thing that means the most to her. \n\nIs it weird? Absolutely. \n\nBut it is what it is. Think of the things that means a lot to you, and where she is accommodating to you on those fronts. \n\nThis sounds like the kinda thing where you could be an average boyfriend on 10 other points, and great at showering with her - And she'll take that any day. \n\nBut if you can't accommodate her shower thing? It'll just breed resentment going forward.\n\nAnd I hereby pronounce:\n\nYTA (mild)\n\nBecause this is something that you don't mind doing (within reason and under certain circumstances) and something she absolutely needs to do.", "NAH. She may see it as romantic together-time, and feels rejected. Maybe discuss it? And find other ways.", "NAH. \n\nIt's fun that your gf is putting in the effort for you guys but you don't have to oblige, it's really simple. \n\nIf you don't make any concessions in a relationship I think that is sad. My gf like to talk with me when she get off work until she arrives home. Even if I like to spend the time reading and talk more when she get home I do it because I feel how happy it makes her.", "Save it for \"special occasions\"", "I love taking showers with my boyfriend but we don\u2019t do them very often for all those reasons above which makes when we do shower together extra special treat!", "Agreed. Hubs and I do it on occasion but I hate sharing showers. I\u2019m the kinda gal who just wants to wash her damn hair then bask in my boiling lava bliss for awhile and contemplate life\u2019s mysteries in peace \ud83e\udd23 For gf to be THIS salty about it makes me question if she\u2019s as mature as one ought to be\u2026", "Thank u for the wedding crashers moment it's my husband and I's fav.  Also take baths together OP.  Showers are not the place for intimacy.", "Oh lord. I reference the love toilet at least once a week!", "The girlfriend sounds clingy and controlling. I bet she insists on going to bed at the same time every night, too.", "And what happens if OP's thing is not sharing a shower? It's a basic hygiene thing. How long are these dual showers taking? \n\nWhat happens if your partner wants to sit on your lap while you shit? What if you're not comfortable with your boundaries being broke? Just accept that? Bullshit.", "Yes, it should very much be an occasional thing. Every time is way too much. NTA.", "I'm am so with you on this!! I love boiling lava bliss and I don't need hubs complaining about 3rd degree burns and interrupting my my quite time!", "Going to bed at around the same time would be more reasonable, at least I can see some logical reasons that can cause arguments (waking the other one up, noise in the other room etc). But showering?", "Maybe. What if OP needs to stay up to finish something or maybe he's talking to a friend or something. \n\nDefinitely no to the showering together, though.", "I mean I don't thinknit should be a hard and fast rule basically ever rig by.  Like you can have a preference to go to bed together at roughly similar times, but even if you both agree to that there has to be one offs."]}
