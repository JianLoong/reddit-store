With Covid/money/distance/pregnancy, we haven't seen them in four-and-a-half years. We stay in contact through Facebook. When we message him, she usually responds on his behalf. He never posts anything on his own page, he's not really a social media user. About three years ago, we discovered she posts a lot on Facebook but has blocked the women (me, my mum \\[56F\\] and my sister \\[36F\\]) from seeing her posts. We found out because she hasn't blocked the men and my sister's boyfriend mentioned something about a picture of my brother. There's never been any problems between us so not sure why we were blocked from seeing her posts. My sister decided we weren't allowed to say anything to her about it in case it upset her and caused her to block our brother from contacting us. It's come up quite a few times since and my sister has insisted that we shouldn't say anything about it. Then she became pregnant and had the baby. Since then, it has been mentioned constantly. My mum is upset that our extended family (aunts/uncles/cousins and the men) can all see the photos of the baby and we can't - she posts a lot! Then, a separate group chat was set up (without my brother or the girlfriend in it) for the men to screenshot the photos and send them to those who couldn't see. In my opinion, it was all getting rather silly. All the while, no one is allowed to talk to her about it because my sister thinks she'll get upset and cut us off.\n\nAnyway, today my brother's girlfriend send some photos to the group chat (the original one) and says if we want to see any more photos to let her know but she doesn't want to fill the chat with hundreds of unwanted pictures. I thought it was a pretty nice set-up so I said \"Aww, very cute! Are they all on your page? You could just unblock us\". She responded asking what I meant and couldn't I see her page and I said \"I can only see when you update your cover/profile picture. It's been like that for years\". She then checked her settings and found we'd been restricted by accident (apparently along with a whole load of her friends and relatives) and she reversed it - the conversation moved on.\n\nThis evening, my sister messaged the group chat that was set up specifically to send photos of the baby with a really long message using words like \"confusing\" \"hurtful\" \"exhausted\" \"strong feelings\" and basically saying I need to have more \"tact\" and \"kindness\" when speaking to her. Frankly, this has pissed me off. There's a whole backstory about how my sister treated me when I was pregnant and postpartum and I feel like she's in no position to tell me to have more tact/kindness (and I told her as much) - I also don't think anything I said was remotely tactless or unkind.", "created_utc": 1677696758, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11fc8q0/aita_for_telling_my_brothers_girlfriend_we_know/", "score": 144, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You both have the same relationship with her - it's not her place to decide how all family communications should go.\n\nFurther, it's super weird that your brother has zero voice in all of this. I can maybe understand walking on eggshells with the GF, but why can nobody level with your brother?", "NTA, but maybe your finger accidently slips and blocks your sister.", "NTA\n\nHere's a novel idea: you can speak for yourself and your sister can speak for herself. I can't even guess why your sister thinks it's her place to manage your interactions with another adult. Ignore her. She is overstepping her t bounds.

It's understandable that you and your family members would want to see photos of your brother's baby and be included in his girlfriend's Facebook posts. It's also reasonable to ask her about the block and to express your confusion and hurt feelings about being excluded for no apparent reason. It's good that you were able to resolve the issue by her reversing the block. \n\nHowever, it seems like there may be some underlying tensions and unresolved issues between you and your sister that are complicating things. It's important to address those issues separately and not let them cloud the situation with your brother's girlfriend. It's also important to approach conversations with kindness and tact, but it doesn't seem like you said anything particularly unkind or tactless in this situation. Ultimately, it's important for everyone to communicate openly and honestly in order to resolve any conflicts or misunderstandings.", "The lady doth protest too much. \n\nNTA and WTF\n\nGood for the men that quietly kept you and the other women in the family in the loop.", "NTA- you just cleared up a very innocent misunderstanding, yay! But boy, howdy, there is something wrong with your sister. I wouldn't want to spend much time or take her word for anything moving forward. She seems like a lot.", "NTA Your somewhat SIL accidentally had restrictions she either forgot about or was unaware of. You mentioned you couldn't see the photos and she realized why and corrected it. No big deal. You weren't lacking tact or being unkind.", "NTA I am SO confused by your sisters reaction. I can\u2019t see why she is upset that you said what you said to bros GF. Really truly deeply confused. Weird.", "NTA is your sister ok??? The behavior is so strange", "Sounds like everything worked out.  Your sis has her own issues apparently.  Just ignore her.", "NTA. Why your sister had decided to nominate herself as family spokesperson and communications manager is baffling. \n\nYour adults and are capable of communicating with each other and guess what - it solved this issue! You brought the problem to your SILs attention and it was solved without any of the drama your sister anticipated.", "You can't restrict or block a whole group of people on Facebook by accident.\n\nNTA\n\nShe probably thought you wouldn't notice. You weren't even rude or mean with what you said, you even stated \"aww very cute\". Your sister is being extra. Ignore her.", "NTA your sister is. It genuinely sounds like she blocked y'all by mistake or maybe meant to block y'all for one post and forgot to change back.", "NTA it sounds like it was an accident and your sister is being weird. Even if it wasn't an accident, the best-case scenario of \"we're no longer blocked and there don't seen to be hard feelings\" is the case here. I'd advise against letting your sister micromanage you like that in the future, be kind (which you were) but trust your gut.", "lol NTA \"restricted by accident\" isn't a thing. There are a great many steps where you have to individually restrict people in order to control what access they have to your social media. This is her DARVOing to the extreme", "NTA You should use this as an excuse to start ignoring your sister. If I were you, I would just say yeah uh-huh and then do what I want anyway.  Let her rant and rave like a screaming, lunatic all she wants. Eventually like a toddler, she\u2019ll learn that tantrums are not the way to get what she wants.", "YTA. People are allowed to block people from their social media accounts, for a good reason or no reason at all.

Move on!", "Esh, you pointing out you were blocked not wrong. Could have been better in private message however you did it in a joking matter. \n\nYour sister is overacting and trying to control your guys relationship with your brother and his gf. \n\nYou suck a little for no one should be sending anyone pictures of someone else baby. Especially when that person is knowingly blocked. You guys created a gc just for that. That is not respectful towards your brother or brother girlfriend as the parents of the baby. Doesn\u2019t matter that its family.", "Thanks. The difficulty with speaking to him directly is that we can't actually contact him without her there - she's present for every phone call on loudspeaker and she views/responds to his messages. So, either way, we'd be essentially communicating with both of them. If he'd raised something where it were relevant, I would've said it to him - I only raised it with her at that point because she'd explicitly brought up sharing the photos and it felt like not saying anything was borderline deceitful at that point. If he had made the same comment (in the group or privately), I'd have said the same thing to him in response.", "You're correct in your second paragraph, thank you. The issues with my sister are actually very much linked to my brother's girlfriend (even though my brother's girlfriend has no idea). For example, during both my pregnancies, I was very unwell and hospitalised but my sister banned me from mentioning my pregnancy in the group chat at all because my brother and his girlfriend were trying to conceive - she even kept that up after she found out that my brother's girlfriend was pregnant. My sister didn't refrain from mentioning her own pregnancy when I was trying to conceive though. When I found out I was pregnant for the second time and I told my sister, her response was \"oh no, have you told \\[brother\\] and \\[girlfriend\\] yet?\" and then the entire following conversation was about how they're trying to conceive and that I need to tell them immediately because she doesn't feel comfortable keeping it from them (I was five weeks pregnant at the time and only told my sister because I was in hospital). When my second baby was born, we were discharged from hospital and drove for two hours to see my mum and my sister - within five minutes of us arriving (hadn't even sat down, mum hadn't held my baby), my sister video-called my brother and his girlfriend so that they could announce that they were pregnant (my sister already knew and thought it was the best time to tell my mum) - they didn't even ask how I was or how my baby was. The next hour was spent on a call to them talking about her pregnancy. Honestly, it's very odd to me and it really, really hurts because my sister is my best friend but when my brother's girlfriend is involved she seems to be really controlling and not consider me at all.", "A few years ago, it happened to me - a whole bunch of people suddenly couldn't see my posts until I changed my settings a few times. Facebook is not some perfect machine of magical software - it's a garbage heap made by a person trying to desperately claw money out of social media. \n\nMaybe don't immediately jump to conclusions when you aren't the one programming the damn thing.", "Or there was a post she made a few years ago that she didn't want everyone to see so she set it up then for that one post. And then forgot to change the settings after. There is literally like one step you have to take to do it and it's very easy to not realize you have to take action again to stop not showing posts. I accidentally blocked my mom for year when I only meant to block her from like 3 posts at a party.", "Restricted by accident 100% is a thing, signed by the doof who did this and wondered why hardly any of my friends ever commented on my posts. I only found out when I went to show a friend something I posted from their phone -_- it had been over a year!", "This! She is trying to control him and everything else in his life. She is very manipulative and gaslighting.", "Thanks - I meant sister. My brother's girlfriend hasn't indicated she's upset at all. She said lots of people were accidentally blocked, she told us about a few of them and one was her grandpa and she then told us a funny \"boomers on Facebook\"-style story about him. She seemed fine. My sister is upset that I mentioned it because she thinks I could have upset my brother's girlfriend and, if I had upset her, she might've caused issues between us and our brother.", "It's reasonable for people to block others on social media, but it's also understandable for family members to feel hurt and confused if they're blocked without any explanation or reason. The family members did reach out to the brother's girlfriend privately before making any public comments. While the brother should be responsible for responding to his family and sending photos, the girlfriend is still a part of their family and should have some responsibility to maintain relationships with them as well. Ultimately, it's important for all family members to communicate openly and respectfully to address any issues or concerns they have.", "NTA but do you not see red flags with the fact that your communication with your brother is monitored by her? Reverse their sexes. If it was your sister being monitored by a man, you'd care.", "Your sister\u2019s behavior is so weird. It seems she\u2019s trying to insert herself and exert control over the relationship between you and your SIL. Is she close to your SIL, and possibly speaking for her? Otherwise, extremely weird and suspicious behavior.", "This is super weird.\n\n> really hurts because my sister is my best friend\n\nThat is not how a bf who loves you acts.", "Ooooof OK I'm starting to see how your sister might've gotten y'all on the restricted list! She seems very... self-inserty. \n\nYour brother's girlfriend probably didn't mean anything nasty -- just got similar weird controlling vibes and decided to try to limit the amount of information your sister had access to, in the hopes of keeping the uncomfortable situations to a minimum.", "I mean, who cares what she blathers on about?

You or your mother should have reached out to the girlfriend privately way back when you realized you couldn't see her stuff.\n\nStill think YTA on the exact question you asked,  for commenting like that in a group chat.

I bet sis has been talking schmack to sil and needs to keep everyone separated for the lies to not unravel.", "Thanks, I see your point. To be honest, I only raised it because of what she had said. Even five seconds before reading her message, I had no intention of saying anything.

Is there a setting I need to fix on my end?\"", "I am not seeing where you are getting that anyone in the family reached out to the SIL. The section of the post you quoted doesn't remotely indicate that anyone mentioned it to the SIL.  The quoted text is just pointing out how they figured out they were blocked... \nHer sisters boyfriend mentioned a post of SIL's that contained a picture of their brother that neither the OP or the sister had seen. This led them to the conclusion that SIL had blocked them. Then the sister stated no one should mention this to the SIL under any circumstances. So they didn't.", "Okay so there's a lot of violation of privacy here.\n\n1. Why does she respond on behalf of your brother when you message your brother? This is a huge red flag if you ask me. I mean, if you message your brother, isn't he the one who is supposed to respond?\n\n2. The men who are allowed to see her posts created a group chat where they can screenshot the pictures that she posts and send them to you. This is a total violation of privacy. If she wanted you to see the pictures, she would not have restricted you in the first place. But it baffles me why she didn't just restrict everyone. Because she should know someone will just give you all the information some day! \n\n3. No, she did not restrict you mistakenly. I've restricted people in the past. It requires certain steps and it can't happen by mistake.\n\n4. There is a reason why she restricted you, your mother and your sister in the first place. You are allowed to ask her the reasons for doing so. There is no need to push issues under the rug as your sister wants you to do. That isn't healthy.", "NTA but are you sure your SIL is monitoring and controlling your brother? My husband constantly puts his family on speaker phone while I'm with him and I'm the one who ends up sending pics/videos and updates and invites for things to his family because he just doesn't do it. Like he's not on the same social media as them and just wouldn't really contact them unless I pushed because they're all great people. He's just socially very lazy. Could this be the reason for your brother's lack of contact? And I've also deleted and blocked people on FB when they do updates and stuff. Sounds like it was an accident. Why does your sister care?", "NTA. Your sister's behavior is really, really odd. I've been reading your comments and it sounds like this is a repeated problem.
