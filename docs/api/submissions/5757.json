He got me bracelets, anklets, rings, earrings, even a waist chain. Edit: I asked him multiple times to stop with the initialed jewelry, but he says he\u2019s not good at getting gifts, so I send him links to things I want and make sure to explicitly say I want him to get it for me. He ignores the links.\n\nI keep track of the things he talks about and mentions, this year I bought him winter boots, the AirPod Max, and two video games. He loved all of them and I was so happy to see him smiling!!\n\nI asked him to buy me a coat and some nice Dior makeup, but he ignored me and got me yet another necklace with his name on it. I opened it and started bawling in front of his family. I screamed at him to stop getting me this crap and threw the box at him. I told him I want the gifts I gave him back so I could return them and get something I really want, and buy him a necklace with MY name on it for Christmas instead. He said that all the jewelry he\u2019s bought cost thousands of dollars, how I was the one that wanted the jewelry in the first place, and I\u2019ve become a completely different person. He accused me of not wanting to tell people about being in a relationship to make it easier for me to cheat on him, and for being a gold digger. \n\nTLDR: Boyfriend bought me around 15 pieces of jewelry with his name/initial.

In these details alone you highlight continuous disrespect, disregard, apathy, and manipulative tendencies from this man. It's very easy to understand what has gone wrong when you purchase a gift for somebody that they have explicitly stated they do not want to receive. This is an adult man you're talking about, not a golden retriever who doesn't understand not to jump on people walking in through the door. \n\nIt doesn't seem like he cares about your happiness, and you should be asking yourself why you think you deserve to be in a long-term partnership with somebody who doesn't value your happiness and seek to contribute to it.

If you\u2019re not wearing my initial, that means you\u2019ll cheat on me. Wtf. Not cool and if he sees the jewelry as a type of brand\u2026.eww.\n\nYou\u2019re behavior with the present was grossly inappropriate. No one told you to buy him $1k worth of gifts. That was your choice alone. I think you know that taking back gifts and throwing / insulting the gift you received is wrong. You should have quietly accepted it and then had a conversation about it later.

Your boyfriend was clearly being a bit thick, by not thinking that getting the same gift every year is probably a bit much, especially if you've asked him not to, but also ignoring what you'd actually like in favour for getting something 'safe.' If he's that bad at buying gifts, why not just take you shopping and letting you buy what you'd like?
