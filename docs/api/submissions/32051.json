He was super possessive of his electronics and would freak out if he left his phone in my presence unguarded. He changed his phone password without telling me, even though he had my passwords for everything. \n\nOnce I was on the phone with my insurance company nurse after work. I was in the parking garage. My ex called me looking for dinner, but I was busy, so I texted him that I was talking to the insurance nurse and I would call him back after. Well, he lost it. He used \"find my phone\" through Google on my computer, and being in the parking garage, the GPS was off by ~200ft and showed me in the neighborhood behind my job. He continuously called me and texted me to the point that I had to tell the nurse I couldn't hear her over my phone beeping repeatedly, and I'd have to call her back later. He sulked for the rest of the night when I got home. \n\nAny time I went out for drinks with my coworkers, do laundry at my parents' house, go to an event he was invited to but refused to attend, he would ping my phone with Google to check on me. \n\nAfter years of this, I put a tracker on my car. He refused to maintain his, so it was broken down more often than not, and he would use mine. I caught him at a hotel with someone four days later. Apparently, he'd had several emotional affairs with women online and met up with this one using fake friends as a cover. All his accusations, all of his paranoia, was a projection because he had been unfaithful for years. He was constantly lying to me, but I trusted him implicitly, unquestioning, until he went on vacation with his \"uncle\" that no one in his family knew anything about. That's when I had to pull my head out of my ass and knock him off his pedestal.\n\nMy friends saw what was happening. Several of them gently implied that he was no good, but I just kept ignoring the red flags. They were all very supportive once I figured it all out.
