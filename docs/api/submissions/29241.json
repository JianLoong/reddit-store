When the \u201callergies\u201d became too severe to lie about anymore, they told us he was actually sick. I was already annoyed at him because he kept tracking large chunks of dirt in my home, despite me pointing it out, vacuuming it all up, and my husband telling him to stop tracking dirt through our home. BF\u2019s reply was that my husband \u201cembarrassed\u201d him.\nBF also spent the weekend just open-mouth coughing all over our home and on me while we were out for lunch (when he was still saying it was just allergies). He didn\u2019t make an effort to cover his mouth at all, which I found repulsive.\n\nWell, on top of the stress of BF\u2019s inconsideration for our home, now I\u2019m very sick. I\u2019ve been taking everything possible to make myself well again, but it\u2019s the day before the big event and I\u2019m still very sick.\nTomorrow I have to speak on stage and network all day long.\n\nHusband and I are so livid that MIL\u2019s BF knowingly brought illness to our home, and tried to hide it, that we have now banned him from ever staying at our house again.\n\nMIL and her BF think we are overreacting, and that illness just happens and is a natural part of life.\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697724776, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17bk4yr/aita_for_banning_mils_bf_from_my_home/", "score": 588, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Cover your mouth and when you're sick stay home so you don't get anyone else sick. They both failed to do what we teach children, lied about it, and acted like it's not a big deal.\n\nNta. They are adult babies and don't respect you, your husband, or your home.", "NTA OP, but contrary to what your MIL and her BF I think you're actually underreacting. Your ban should also apply to your MIL too because she knew that her BF was legitimately sick and she still chose to bring him over to your home knowing about your autoimmune disorder. She displayed the same kind of reckless disregard for your boundaries and health that her BF did. And now you're having to deal with the consequences for their blatant disregard for common decency and basic levels of respect. Your husband shouldn't have a problem backing you on this because he's seen what happens to you when you become infected with even the most minor illnesses. And given that it was his mother and her BF that caused you to become so violently ill should have him beyond ticked off. MIL and her BF have already lied to you and your husband's faces multiple times knowing it was a huge risk to your health, which proves they couldn't care less about you and your health if their life depended on it. And because they've already pulled this stunt once there's no doubt they'll pull it again in the future if either of them are allowed in your house. Please ban your MIL as well OP to ensure you're not the victim of their disgusting behavior again. \n\nI hope you heal quickly enough to be able to get through your event with as few problems as possible OP, and that you get better soon!", "NTA - your MIL and her BF are horribly inconsiderate. If they\u2019re going to refuse to act like civilized human beings, they shouldn\u2019t be surprised when they\u2019re uninvited. \n\nThey\u2019re right, illness does happen\u2026 so they need to stay home and deal with it, not spread it to their relatives.", "NTA They knowing you have an autoimmune disorder and did it anyway? People that spread illness are the worst, most inconsiderate people! What they may get over in a day or two can hospitalize or even kill someone else! \n\nShout out to the mom of the second grader who insisted to the school nurse, \u201cI\u2019m not sick anymore! My mommy gave me all kinds of medicine this morning.\u201d \n\nMy son was in the hospital for a week. \n\nStand your ground you\u2019re being more than reasonable that you\u2019re still even talking to them!", "NTA, they deliberately ignored your very clear and reasonable  boundaries. Glad your husband is on your side.", "NTA at all -- but I think you might be TA if you don't ban them *both*: she showed up sick, too, right?\n\nI mean, that's just common courtesy to not go visiting people when you're sick, even in \"ordinary\" times... but FFS! We're just coming out of the worst pandemic in over a century, and they obviously didn't learn any lessons from that either, like \"Stay home if you're sick\".", "NTA . Disrespecting your home by tracking chunks of dirt in, despite you asking MIL's BF to stop was reason enough to kick him out.\n\nMIL & MIL's BF turning up sick when they know about your disorder should be enough to get them BOTH banned permanently ... that's just being plain disrespectful to you and your Husband.", "NTA: they knew better. They absolutely knew better, and they refused to be considerate. I think the ban is entirely fair.", "NTA. Knowingly visiting anyone when you\u2019re sick is an AH move. The fact that you have an autoimmune disease makes it unforgivable.", "NTA they sound incredibly thoughtless. Lay down the boundaries and live by them. Good luck tomorrow, you will be great.", "But if you go to your event while you're still sick, aren't you just doing the same thing they did? There will be people you network with who also have autoimmune disorders.\n\nYou're allowed to disallow whomever you want in your home for any reason, but you don't have a moral high ground if you still go to your event (assuming it's in-person considering you mentioned a stage).", "NTA This is incredibly rude, ignorant and nasty behavior. I am not sure why your MIL wants him and surely can see why he isn\u2019t welcome in your home.", "NTA. If they show up again, call the police and report trespassing.", "NTA. \n\nThat was just pure selfishness on their part. I don't think I'd allow the MIL to come over either. She knew he was sick and couldn't stand up for her family. She's just as guilty as he is. They sound horrible. You have a serious disease and they treated it like it was nothing.", "NTA  \nI don't have any health issues and it infuriates me when people are so damned inconsiderate! There are few things more self centered than knowingly exposing people to illness, even more so given your situation. You are absolutely within your rights and not over reacting at all. He can't be bothered to show the least bit of respect to you and your husband, who should not have to deal with being exposed to BF's germs either.", "NTA 1000x \n\nI honestly think you under-reacted. Autoimmune conditions are so tricky, and once you have one, you\u2019re far more likely to get more. And new autoimmune conditions can get triggered by things like flus or extreme stress. I had a new autoimmune condition triggered by a cold last year - I ended up losing 30% of my body weight in 4 months and then I had flu symptoms (but not an actual flu) for *eight months*. It was miserable and I wouldn\u2019t wish it on my worst enemy. \n\nMIL and her BF were *waaaay* too cavalier with your health and don\u2019t seem to care that stuff like this can have lifelong consequences. Personally, I wouldn\u2019t let either of them in my house again, but I don\u2019t fuck around when it comes to my health. \n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA, what they did was highly inconsiderate and I would be fuming too, especially given the important work day you had coming up. I swear, the older generation complains about how the young ones are so selfish and entitled but the Boomers are just the worst, they think they can do whatever they want with no consequences because they're old and if you call them on it they gaslight you because \"WhAtS the BiG dEaL!!\". Illness is a part of life but when you have an autoimmune disease that illness takes on a whole other level. Sorry he was such an AH and good luck at your big event (if you manage to get there)!", "NTA.", "NTA. They are very inconsiderate to expose you to their illnesses, especially since you have an autoimmune disease.

My SIL did the same to us.  My son has genetic disorder that causes tumors to grow on his nerves.  The meds he is on effects his immune system so he can get sick very easily.  My SIL likes to take vacations and just shows up to a relatives house and will stay the entire week without a heads up that she is coming by and expects everyone to cater to her.  Well she shows up already sick and just coughs everywhere and on everything.  After about 3 days I had enough and asked her to leave.", "NTA and the absolute disrespect they showed you and your home is unacceptable.  Adults don't act this way, children might.  I am just flabbergasted that they did this to you and I'm sorry.\n\nWhen my parents were elderly, I wouldn't visit them if I had even the hint of a cold.  They weren't ill (except at the end of their lives), but they didn't need the added load of catching a cold from me.  I let my adult children know that I have a cold if they're planning on visiting me.  They, and my grandchildren, don't need to get sick too.  When you care for someone, you don't do that to them.", "NTA. What they did was life-threatening for you; you could point out that defending oneself is also a \"natural part of life\". And since they are so careless(lying jerks), naturally, they won't be trusted again.", "Illness is a natural part of life but willingly spreading it, especially to someone who could have giant health repercussions (including death) as a result is just...  Neglect and telling you to just take it is abusive.\n\nMy doctor always says, sure...  it was fine this time.  But next time maybe it won't be.  Next time maybe you just die.\n\nAnd I think about that a lot when I hear people being so cavalier with the lives of others for no reason except that they're extremely selfish.  Which really just means they aren't worth knowing at all, doesn't it?\n\nI'd rather be healthy and miss someone a bit than be sick as a dog (or deceased) and be missing out on my life.", "This is a MIL problem just as much, probably more than a problem with her bf. *She* knew he was sick. *She* knew about your AI issue, and *she* chose to bring him anyway, and try to cover for it by calling it \"allergies\".", "NTA.\n\nWhen you are I\u2019ll, stay your butt at home.\n\nYour MIL and bf are the reason covid spread so quickly.", "NTA.  Illness does happen, and it's a natural part of life.  However, if you know someone has an autoimmune disease, and you know you're sick, then you're an asshole for coming around knowing those things.  To add insult to injury they both lied and said it was allergies.  They didn't care about you or your health, so why should you care about their feelings?  Ban away.", "Nta and mil and bf are ah", "As someone with a suppressed immune system myself, I say a hearty ***NTA***. What part of \"autoimmune disorder\" do your in-laws not understand? Your mother-in-law needs to be educated. Ban them both from your house until they learn to respect your condition.", "I would ban them both.", "NTA - When visiting everyone knows to respect the household rules. BF sounds like a real AH for dragging dirt into your house repeatedly. And coughing openly on others. I wouldn't ever invite him over again . . period! How else will he prove his uncouthness? I'm sorry you are sick . . .  maybe wear a mask in public. Also, virus illness can kill and can cause permanent harm. I lost my hearing in one ear (permanently and profoundly) when I had a flu some years ago. I still miss hearing in stereo and directionally.", "NTA.  Both of them are beyond AH at this point.", "NTA. I hope you feel better and recover soon.", "> MIL and her BF showed up sick and told us it was just allergies. When the \u201callergies\u201d became too severe to lie about anymore, they told us he was actually sick.\n\nHow do you know they were lying? I had covid (years back) and it was in the middle of covidhype, so I got tested - but it felt exactly like very bad allergies. \n\nYou knew they were sick and let them in? Okay it's 100% on you, then. You didn't know they were sick? Well then maybe they did not either and it's just a tricky situation.\n\nEither way: You either needed to tell two sickies to leave and come back later OR it was a situation where nobody knew and you can not just assign all the blame wholly on them. \n\nWith the dirt, a stronger case here. Guests need to abide by a house's rules. \n\nAre YTA? Yes, a little - on the sickness, which seems to be the crux of things here. NTA on the dirt. Guests should do better.", "NTA we just went through a pandemic where we were constantly being reminded to cover our mouths when we cough and to wash our hands. MIL's BF was being deliberately disrespectful, as he was not only doing the above, but was also traipsing mud throughout your house too.\n\nI often work with small children, and as your MIL's Bf clearly has the maturity level of a pre-schooler, I would suggest sending them this https://youtu.be/DG4n0r8-UPA\n\nStill ban him from your house though. If MIL continues to complain about it, tell her that she can join him in being banned.", "NTA. Kick them out!", "NTA, while sickness is a part of life. 1) You don't lie and say it's only allergies, 2) You don't intentionally spread it to other people 3) Stay home. Ban them from your home seriously. Your health is more important than anything.", "NTA but I think maybe that should extend to mil too. Sounds like she doesn\u2019t take you seriously and actively assisted in hiding a sickness from you.", "NTA. But when you saw them being symptomatic why did you even chance it? I\u2019m willing to bet this is not the first time they have been rude & entitled? Are you waiting to wind up in the hospital next time. I personally would be done with them both. Hubby can have a relationship with his mom but I would not even acknowledge their existence.", "So NTA. I thankfully have a healthy immune system but still expect people who are sick to let me know before they are in my space, and I'm happy to return the favor. Especially when i have travel or an event coming up. \n\nSure, sickness can be a part of life, but so can courtesy. You could have seen them after your event.", "Nta I'm having the exact same issue with my in-laws and covid. I've had multiple different medications and I'm working really hard with my PCP to keep me out of the hospital. In laws (who passed their germs to us) are out at a birthday meal sharing their bugs with more unsuspecting people. \n\nYou get to decide who is allowed in your home. Full stop. It doesn't matter what they've done or not done. That's your safe space and you're entitled to decide who gets to enter. Having said that, to them, illness does just happen and is a part of life. For people like us, viruses and infections mean something completely different. They seem to lack the insight or critical thinking needed to understand this. There's always the possibility that if you explain this to them, they might understand but anyone that's willing to lie about being sick, go be a guest in someone else's home and put an immunocompromised person at risk probably doesn't care.", "NTA", "\"Family makes family sick - it's how we show our love!\"\n\nBizarre.\n\nBF has multiple strikes against, what with the dirt and all.", "My husband says he is banning his mother too. I wasn\u2019t going to ban my husbands own mother.\n\nYou really hit the nail on the head! Everywhere these days, we see people walking around, open-mouth coughing. I still wear a mask in crowds because of this. I\u2019ve been wondering the same thing - did nobody learn anything from the pandemic??", "You\u2019re right and I did think of this. I\u2019ll be wearing an N-95 mask at the event and will just have to explain myself and distance myself from others - not shake hands, etc. I\u2019m certainly not interested in making others sick. On the other hand, my board is relying on me to lead the event. My Presidency is being announced after the last speaker finishes. This is partly why I\u2019m so livid. I\u2019m one of those people who wore N-95 masks before Covid existed and continue to wear them in crowds and especially on airplanes, despite people being so very rude about it and mocking me, assuming I\u2019m \u201cCovid-paranoid.\u201d\nI\u2019m between a rock and a hard place and will go to great lengths to not spread.\nBut I\u2019m livid that I can\u2019t put my best foot forward tomorrow.", "Except in OP's case, she likely doesn't have much of a choice about going. As the organizer, she almost certainly has to be there.", "You always blame decent people for the actions of their asshole relatives or nah?", ">They not only knew about my immune disorder but also knew that in 5 days (now tomorrow) I\u2019m hosting the biggest event of my career\n\nBetween this, him open-mouth coughing on OP (which is revolting), and then them trying to play this off as \u201callergies\u201d, I think it\u2019s safe to say they knew what they were doing. They don\u2019t take OP\u2019s condition seriously and prioritize themselves. It\u2019s ridiculous and I wouldn\u2019t forgive them at all if this wrecks her big professional development day.", "LOL That is exactly how I got chicken pox at 14 after surviving yearly outbreaks at school for 1st through 7th grade. My 4 year old brother brought it home from daycare and proudly told the doctor he shared it with me.", "Oh, I totally get why you're frustrated. And I empathize with your situation, having an autoimmune disorder myself that has forced me to give professional presentations sounding like an Old West madame and breaking frequently just to catch my breath (I've WFH for about a decade, so, fortunately, I don't need to worry about spreading cooties as my presentations are always remote). Someone's inconvenient sniffles turns into a multi-day 101\u00b0F fever for me. I *totally* get it. And like I said, you're NTA for disallowing anyone in your home, especially given the circumstances.\n\nI appreciate you taking your own precautions. That would be my only concern. It's how these cycles start. And, unfortunately, we simply don't have an infrastructure that actually encourages people to stay home when they're ill to prevent spreading it around like this.\n\nDefinitely give the MC a heads-up you caught a bug so they can sanitize the mic/podium. Good luck and congrats on your promotion.", "No, never. And even in the post you are responding to, I blame the boyfriend for his actions w/ the dirt on his shoes, which completely proves your statement (made in the form of a question) invalid. If I somehow blamed the decent people, then why am I saying the 'asshole' guests were in the wrong bringing dirt into the house? Can you explain that? If your faulty statement had any value -- I would also be blaming the OP for the boyfriend dragging dirt into their house.\n\nTo the sickness: We only have the OP's word. Two sneezing relatives show up and claim they have allergies.\n\nOkay - so it's only one of two situations.\n\n1. It is obvious they are sick (which the OP seems to insinuate was the case). In this case: People have *personal responsibility*, here and for the sake of argument, let's say it was 100% certain they were sick. You tell them to leave. Period. No question. No ifs, ands or buts. It it people's own responsibility to protect themselves and it is her house. \n\n2. It is not clear they are sick to the OP. Which means, it is also unclear to the relatives. In which case, you can not assign the entire blame on them either, it was unclear or they genuinely believed they were not sick. \n\nCan you address this? I already made this point which I made clear - yet you just assumed and posted as if I was somehow blaming the 'decent' OP for their 'asshole' relatives - with you assigning morality to each party. \n\nI'm not - I am 100% only looking at the story based on what we know from the OP. The relatives being assholes or decent or whatever, it is all irrelevant. We can only look at the facts as we know them. \n\nSo, why doesn't the OP have any responsibility for exposing herself to sick people OR how can you blame people who nobody knew were sick? Tell me that.", "Don't rule out deliberate sabotage, they don't want OP to be successful. It's no surprise that plenty of people feel a need to drag others down because they mistakenly think it's a way to build themself up.", "They had medicine with them for the illness and were hiding it from us. That tells me they were lying about \u201callergies\u201d and when the illness progressed beyond what could acceptably appear as allergies while secretly using cold medicine, then they admitted he was sick.\nI don\u2019t make assumptions, but as someone who assumes, I can see why it would appear that way to you without knowing every detail.", "MIL and her bf actually lied about it being allergies and then, according to the post, admitted he was ill when it became too clear it couldn't be just allergies. So, no, most people are not going to blame OP for trusting that guests are not complete AHs.", "This information would have been helpful to mention in the OP, for future reference. \n\nSo, both lied but you have only banned the boyfriend and not the MIL? Why? If they were both complicit in this lying and covering up, why not both? Sounds like the two of them both should be banned from the home for lying and putting you at risk (a risk that unfortunately got you sick and you lost an opportunity with)", "OP commented in another thread that they\u2019re both banned now", "Fair and equitable.", "NTA. I have an autoimmune disease too. I\u2019m on immunosuppressive medication and am very careful of my health. As you mentioned it doesn\u2019t take much to get very sick. Many members of my family still think I\u2019m faking it. I have had to stop contest with many of them because of their lack of respect for my health and boundaries. I got tired of being ridiculed for respecting my body\u2019s limits when I refused to push myself into a flare. I may be the youngest child, but I\u2019m the only one with a serious chronic condition that could land me in the hospital or eventually dead if I\u2019m not careful.", "Uummmm\u2026.\n\nNot clear on why you\u2019re only banning the BF.

As soon as you heard the first sniffle, you should have sent them away. They can stay at a hotel, motel or head home. There is no room to negotiate. You two are also AHs bc you\u2019re only mad at the BF when your MIL lied right to your face and went along with this shit.
