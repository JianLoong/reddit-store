It looked like she was upset so, I asked her what was wrong. She said she just weighed herself and that the number was \" not good\". She looked on the brink of tears so, I didn't ask for specifics.\n\nI said that I was sorry to hear she was upset and was up to talk if she wanted to. \n\nShe got very angry with me and said that instead of just being sorry, I should be apologizing for the role that I played.\n\nI asked what the hell she was talking about. She said that for the majority of our 10 year marriage, she's gotten heavier year to year\n\nI asked her where my role in this was. She said I should've stepped in, curbed her from fast food when she got it, discouraged desserts.\n\nI told her that clearly she's upset at herself & taking it out on me and use me as her scapegoat so she doesn't have to take full blame, so, I was done. She told me not to say that to her. She said that as her partner, I should've stopped her from getting out of control. \n\nI made the point that, running on the logic of she is/was out of control, would she really have listened to me if I'd said, \" Maybe skip the ice cream?\"\n\nI told her I'd be happy to help her lose weight, but told her I don't want to be blamed for any of this.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1688491395, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14qla57/aita_for_accusing_my_wife_of_trying_to_use_me_as/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She put you in a no-win scenario and was the asshole for doing so.\n\nShe has no one to blame but herself and you deserve an apology (which I doubt you will get).\n\nI'd let her know you are not ok with that treatment and it's unfair. If she cannot accept that, maybe you have bigger issues to deal with.", "NTA. Unless you literally force fed her every meal in your entire relationship, her mentality is ridiculous. Her choices are the issue, not your \"permission.\"", "NTA at all.\n\nShe is just trying to push the blame onto you for her own misdoings. She needs to take a good hard look at the mirror and put the effort in to change herself and get to where she is happy.\n\nYou aren't the problem.", "NTA\n\nDid you tie her down and force feed her fast food?  Does she have an undisclosed illness like Prader-Willi syndrome, where you never feel full?  \n\nI guarantee, if you  *had*  policed her food intake, her reaction would have been much worse. \n\nif she wants to be \"parented\" for her food choices, she should have told you upfront that she wanted to marry a parental figure and a dietitian.", "NTA- that is a no win situation. Either way she would be mad at you.  She should take personal responsibility for her eatting habits and health. Maybe you could suggest taking walks together, going to a gym, or activities you both can do. Maybe suggest healthier meals for both of you? That's a tricky spot to be in. Good luck.", "nta she's just throwing an adult tantrum", "NTA. Her trying to avoid taking responsibility for her own choices is really unhealthy and worrying. She is an adult and it is not your responsibility to police her choices. I feel like finding some way to encourage her to talk to someone in a professional mental health capacity might be a good idea here, because this is really red flaggy.", "NTA. The only thing you can do is tell her she\u2019s beautiful and not give into the prodding here. She\u2019s looking for reassurance not a fight over fault. At least, that\u2019s my guess.", "NTA, all the comments so far are pretty spot on. Sounds like you love her and will help her lose weight in whatever way you can. Its all you can do really.", "Yeah I\u2019m sure you telling her to watch what she ate and suggesting she go to the gym would\u2019ve gone over great for her. /s\n\nShe has esteem issues and needs a healthy does of activity and therapy (you don\u2019t need to be red lining in the mental health department to benefit from therapy, but her projection is not healthy for your relationship). NTA", "NTA. What were you supposed to do. Knock that double cheeseburger out of her hand? I thought everybody knew that fast food was fattening. Actually cooking your meals at home is a lot healthier than getting junk at McD's.\n\nStand your ground because *you* aren't to blame for her weight gain. If she is so worried, then she needs to change her eating habits & exercise.", "NTA there\u2019s no way you suggesting skipping dessert would have gone over well. \n\nEven if she feels like you have unhealthy lifestyle habits that influenced her, it would still be on her to stick to her guns, and try to motivate you as well, not to blame you. Even if that\u2019s the case, which I\u2019m not saying it is. \n\nI did gain a lot of weight in a past relationship and I did note that my ex had pretty unhealthy lifestyle habits and had begun a way too regular routine of ice cream in the evenings while watching TV. I started skipping the ice cream even though I would join him for TV but I didn\u2019t blame him for my belly rolls.", "Kobayashi maru. No win scenario.  Stand your ground.  NTA", "NTA. She\u2019s definitely just doing whatever she can to avoid rationalizing that this is her own fault and she made her own choices.", "NTA--she evidently isn't accepting her own actions in this preferring to blame you for not stopping her.   You didn't make her eat a thing.  She chose to do that.   That being said, offer to help if she wants is, exercise with her or whatever it will take. She needs to accept her role and want to change if she's ever going to be successful.", "NTA. Oh heck no. She is responsible for her choices, not you. I cannot quite imagine the shitstorm that would probably have erupted if you advised her to lay off the fast food or desserts. She knows how you gain weight - she just doesn\u2019t want to be accountable.", "Nta-  \n\nis she your wife or your child?  She should really think twice before she demands that you be the type of person who needs to control things to the point of what she is and isn't allowed to eat.  There are healthy ways to get your help, but parenting her is not the solution or your responsibility.  Maybe yall could plan meals together, or take a walk at night or something, idk.  Would her parents be open to daily meal monitoring?  I know she's an adult but at least the role fits them in a past tense.  Maybe do a false declaration that \"were just not eating today\" as a test run for if she really wants her meal times to be controlled for her.(probably not actually but it would be funny)", "Nta.  You think she's angry now? She would've accused you of fat shaming her if you encouraged her to modify her intake.   My husband offered to help me and I told him no because I would've been ugly if he tried to stop me.", "im assuming already I won't get an apology", "I certainly wasn't doing that.", "I did, every day I roll her into our kitchen & give her bottomless plates of waffles and brownies, we call it our \" us time\"", "I like that idea", "I didn't want to say it to her face, but, her decisions to over-eat or to eat poorly in general were her doing.", "I've never stopped telling her how beautiful she is", "Well apparently I was supposed to tell her she was getting too fat and throw her into a gym", "Thats what I can't say to her but wish I could point out. She did all of her own over-eating. Did I see her getting heavier and more lethargic, yes, but, I was not about to point it out", "and, in hindsight, maybe I should've seen this coming. 3 weeks ago she complained all week about her work clothes being snug and we spent all Saturday shopping for new, bigger work clothes for her and that night she was very gloomy, I saw her in the bathroom in our bedroom that night prodding at her stomach", "That just feels wrong. I'm sure if roles were reversed and you had blown up at her for no reason she'd expect/demand an apology.", "What!   With no syrup or icecream!  You are cruel!", "That is a trap, right there. If you had told her was getting fat, then you would be the bad guy for fat shaming her. Would she have listened if you had told she needed to go to the gym? I very seriously doubt it. :D\n\nShe just doesn't want to admit that her weight gain is her fault.", "Eh, don\u2019t be hard on yourself about that - even if you might\u2019ve seen that she would be upset, I doubt you could have foreseen that she\u2019d blame you for it!", "I'm thinking she's terribly embarrassed by what she weighs/how she looks and she doesn't mean what she says", "It was just a shitty day because pants she thought would fit didn't fit her and a shirt she thought wouldn't be tight was tight so she had to get the next size up", "I\u2019m guessing this is right - she was upset and reacted poorly, taking it out on you. That said, it\u2019s not fair to you in the least.", "Oof, yeah, I\u2019ve been there myself, and I feel for her - it sucks. You sound like a good husband, for what it\u2019s worth.", "needless to say it was a very quiet shopping trip for me, & thanks"]}
