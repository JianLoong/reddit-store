Which is fine, I signed up for this.  I just took a VERY important test for my job that I had been studying for a long time.  I told my husband that I was allowed to take the last half of the day off after my test using PTO.  I normally am not yet allowed to take time off as I am new and training.  Well I passed my test thank goodness.  I text my husband and he says \"Lets celebrate!\".    When I arrive home he immediately went upstairs to shower for half an hour.  My FIL arrives unannounced (not a big deal, he does this often).  And my husband comes out of his shower and asks me (with FIL sitting nearby with the kids) if I'm ok if he goes out to lunch and shopping with his dad.  Now remember this was my one small window to do something for me for once.  However with FIL sitting there waiting I did not feel like I could say no.  So I told him \"Ok...I would like some time for me too at some point\".  So they left.  Total time he left me with the kids being 3 hours.  I was pretty disappointed and upset by the time they returned that I just went upstairs and told him to leave me alone.  He's mad at me because he thinks I should have told him not to go.

And not speaking to you is him emotionally punishing you for (correctly) standing up for yourself. \n\nBasically, your husband needs to grow up, take responsibility for his own choices, and start thinking of someone other than himself.", "NTA - Hey, you're totally not the a\\*hole and it is fair for you to have your own me-time. This relationship feels like it's heading to a new toxic level if you continue to let this build up. You need to sit down with your husband and talk to him about what you're unhappy about and what you both need to do to make it right. Only through good communication will your relationship prosper. Please talk to him and work something out!", "NTA- you BOTH signed up to have kids. Time to renegotiate the terms of this relationship. You both get equal alone time, and you schedule it in advance so the other person can\u2019t just run off. Your husband is being very disrespectful. He\u2019s not single and childless anymore.

Look, you gave mixed signals and used childish behavior, and he\u2019s oblivious and doesn\u2019t put himself in others shoes. But this one is mostly on you. \n\nYou can\u2019t be mad with him for going out when you told him it was okay to go out, and just give a vague \u201cI would like time for me too at some point.\u201d That could mean today or sometime this month. Then when he comes back at a point that isn\u2019t internally what you wanted, let\u2019s say maybe an hour would have been acceptable after you said YES, you basically stomp off to pout, like one of your children instead of using your words. You do this horrible thing my Dad does, where it essentially feels like we have to be mind readers. He feels situations should be blatantly obvious like they are to him but then gets mad when we don\u2019t know his internal mind, and sulks like you do.\n\nYes, you said you were taking PTO but you didn\u2019t tell him then specifically what your plan was with that time. You said it was okay to go but didn\u2019t tell him how long would be okay. Also, depending on how you say it it wouldn\u2019t have been rude to decline your husband going out. Your FIL dropped by unexpectedly, from his perspective as an unplanned guest he shouldn\u2019t expect other plans to change just for him and it\u2019s okay to say no. Being a people-pleaser is on you. You could have said, \u201cSure, but if you could take the kids with you, they\u2019d love it and I need an afternoon off\u201c or \u201cactually I was thinking of celebrating by doing XYZ\u201d and let them make their plan around that. Neither are rude.\n\nYour husband: like I said, he can\u2019t read your mind and was thoughtful enough to ask permission to go in what to many people wouldn\u2019t be considered a high-pressure setting. BUT, he previously said you would celebrate and then asked to go out with someone else for the afternoon, all without asking you what YOU would like to do with YOUR celebration. He may have thought you having time with the kids would\u2019ve nice (which are some mom\u2019s preferred break from work, no judgment if not) and you guys would celebrate in the evening. And if you\u2019re usually a push over, he should have thought about asking you in private to go with FIL. But you still may have felt pressured to say yes, so I\u2019m on the side of he should\u2019ve asked your plans first. Also he wasn\u2019t thinking about that this is the only PTO you can take during you probation/training period. So he was thoughtless and oblivious but, again, he can\u2019t read your mind. I\u2019d be mad too from his perspective if my spouse was pouty at me over doing something they said was okay but somehow expected me to know the opposite. Though his silent treatment is also unacceptable and childish to a point. Sometimes we need time to cool off, but you should say, \u201cI\u2019m mad right now, I need some time, let\u2019s talk about this tomorrow.\u201d", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
