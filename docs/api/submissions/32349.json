You should never give out your son's personal info to anyone without his consent. And she did abandon him. She doesn't get to waltz back in to try and play happy families now unless your son wants that. \n\nIt's okay to give a child up for adoption but you don't get to turn around and say they stole your child from you and get your flying monkeys to attack them. Your family sounds like a toxic mess. I would block them all.", "NTA AT ALL. She gave up being a mom 20 years ago, and now all the raising is done she wants in on the glory years? She\u2019s nothing but a spawning point and you have stepped up and became is mom.", "NTA. She doesn't get to play the \"mom card\" when she abandoned him. I'm not going to say that there aren't good reasons sometimes that a parent isn't suited to raise a child (having them too young, having drug issues, etc). But if that happens they have to earn their way back into the child's life. She should be down on the floor begging you and her son to rejoin his life.", "NTA but I'd definitely cut her off entirely. She made her choices. That's her problem, not yours.", ">I got backlash from my family.\n\nThese people sound like pieces of work. Where were they when she abandoned ~~HER~~ your son. \n\nNTA.

Sis lost the right to be called his mom the moment you adopted him.", "NTA.  You are the young man's mother, and he's an adult.  He can decide who he wants to keep contact with, and he's not interested in his birth mother.  Karma, baby.", "NTA, you did everything perfect as far as I can see. You let the son contact her, you did not give her his information. He was the one that told her to pound sand, not you. Your family on the other hand should know what has gone on the last 20 years and have absolutely no reason to stick up for the bio mom.", "NTA. Over many years she deliberately made no effort regarding your son. She forfeited the right to be her mother when she skipped the country having signed over parental rights to you. It doesn't take much to ask how he is, the bare minimum to acknowledge his existence.\n\nYou respected your son\u2019s decision. You did the right thing.\n\nHas your sister mentioned any fertility issues? It has been known for people who reject the kid they weren't ready for only to u-turn when they're unable to have any more.", "INFO:  So does she want money or does she need an organ transplant?

In the past 20 yrs you never inquired as to his health, status or anything else.  Today you decide you want to contact him and I passed the message along.  He responded to you that he wants nothing to do with or from you.  I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t like his response but he is an adult and obviously makes his own decisions.

So let me get this straight. Your sister gets pregnant, doesn't want the baby, has the baby and you step up to being his mother despite you being 20 years of age, or less in that moment. You bring up this child, with not help at all from the biological mother, who doesn't even inquire about his wellbeing even in the capacity of an aunt. And then she comes back, when he is already grown up and demands him back as if he was a toy! You are not the asshole at all, but a very good person and your family should be praising you for what you did, instead of siding with the person who abandoned him.

You know, when the kid was an adult and all of the hard work of raising him was done. \n\nIn this case, the correct response to \"you stole my son\" 100% is \"you abandoned him\" because what was the alternative? allow the sister to continue neglecting him? The kid going into the foster care system? The kid being adopted by strangers? I can't see any of those situations panning out the way the sister wanted them to either."]}
