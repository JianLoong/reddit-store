However, the visitation agreement says we only have him every other weekend.\n\nByron's mother lives about 45 minutes from us, and Byron attends school near her apartment. I also happen to work in that area.\n\nOnce school resumed in person 2 years ago, I offered to take Byron to school so my husband wouldn't miss out on the extra time with him. Husband starts work at 5am, so visitation would have to go back to the agreement if I don't drive Byron to school.\n\nThis increases my already long commute by 15 minutes and I have to wake up at least 45 minutes earlier if I want access to the 1 bathroom we have. Byron takes 40-45 minute showers and gets out of the bathroom the time that we need to leave. Husband and Byron's mom won't make him be more courteous and take a shorter shower. This is just one example of a million that really annoys me. In my opinion, they do not hold Byron accountable for his actions, do not make him be responsible in any way, and treat him more like he's 5, not 16.\n\nWhen Byron turned 15 I started to get excited - now he can get his permit, eventually his license, and I get my sleep back. (Byron gets to school early currently due to my work start time, so he would wake up later if he drove himself). However, Byron is now well into being 16 (he turns 16 in the summer - a bit older than most his classmates), and still doesn't even have his permit. I've been talking to him about it since he turned 15, he seems like he is interested, read the book and everything, but his mom tells him he's \"not responsible enough, yet\". Husband won't push the topic with Byron's mom because he is worried about him driving. Important here: once you get out of our neighborhoods, it's a straight shot down one road with a 35MPH speed the entire way until you need to enter 25MPH neighborhoods again. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I told husband that I am not driving a 17/18 year old to school (so next year and after, I won't be). I feel this would give him plenty of time to get his permit and truth be told if he was working towards it I would drive him happily, no matter the age. The way I feel now, though, is they are not teaching Byron responsibility and honestly I feel taken advantage of by the fact that they just assume I'll continue doing it.

It seems like the primary reason for your interest in this would be your own conveniences and while I totally understand wanting more sleep and an easier morning routine, it might not be what\u2019s best for Byron at this time. The bio parents suck because they need to hold him to higher standards of responsibility and encourage his confidence in growing up and becoming a man. You suck because it seems driving him is more of a minor inconvenience and not doing it would result in your husband seeing his son significantly less (and son seeing dad less). All around that sounds like a lose-lose. It seems like the best way you can support your step son right now is to continue driving him and discuss with his *parents* NOT with the child, that he needs to be actively working towards goals in order for you to want to continue helping him.

It turns into a \u201cwinner takes all\u201d energy, vs a collaborative space. \n\nI took a course and one thing that stood out, your feelings are real, but feelings aren\u2019t reality. What you\u2019re feeling isn\u2019t what your husband is feeling isn\u2019t what the ex wife is feeling and isn\u2019t what the son is feeling.

My previous relationship, I told my partner I have a kid and he\u2019s with me 50% of the time. Is this something they\u2019re ok with. After they said yes. I said great. When we started discussing moving in together, it would be as a family. And we sat down again and said let\u2019s discuss what you imagine to be the living and parenting situation. Cause one thing I know. I\u2019m not gonna sit here while some person rips at everything my kids doing wrong while. It celebrating his successes and assisting in developing then to be a good human. Know what you\u2019re signing up for, cause there are enough shitty kids from divorced households out there. \n\nYou all need to communicate. If you want him to get his license, then step up. Or stop complaining. Why is it that it feels like you\u2019re a bystander when it comes to that, but are in the middle of it to make it happen on your schedule. The fact that you said you\u2019d drive him if he was working towards it, but not if he isn\u2019t, means that you\u2019re ok giving up your sleep on your conditions. Which is fine.

That might just be the motivation he needs to get his license.", "And I would be petty as hell and use ALL the hot water a few mornings.", "His showers are probably so long because he's jacking off.", "Agree with this. The shower thing has to stop, you\u2019re already doing he and his bio parents a favor. Also I will note, my husband takes 40 min showers and it leaves me with the choice of either waking up significantly earlier than needed for work, or rushing and doing it right after he finishes which throws off my schedule. It\u2019s a bad habit and that needs to be stopped sooner rather than later. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the BEST solution, but OP could try to reach him to drive when they have him?", "Yeah I have long hair that soaks up shampoo and conditioner like a sponge and takes FOREVER to rinse out. Like ludicrously long. And I have skin allergies so not getting it completely rinsed is *not* an option (hives on my scalp are a big *no thank you*) and I still only take 30 min on deep conditioner days where I shave my legs while the deep conditioner sets. 45 minutes *every. single. day.* is ridiculous.", ">Also NO one needs 40-45 minute\n\nYou stand there for what feels like a minute but in reality it's been 10 minutes. He probably doesn't realize how long he's taking", "NTA. They (both parents) are selfish and act entitled to your time and energy. That\u2019s probably where your stepson gets his bad habits from.", "This. It's not your place to push the license, but you don't need to make things easier for all of them either. Tell them you won't be driving anymore and then it's on them to figure out how to get Byron to school.", "If you just turn off the hot water supply, they will learn even faster.", "to be fair my boyfriend takes 45 minute showers and he often just stands there. I've seen him do it when showering together. your probably right about what Byron's doing, but alot of people seem to be confused about how someone can just chill in the shower without doing anything for an excessive amount of time.", "Rub-a-dub-tug! Love it.", "If that's the case then they need to get a timer for the bathroom. If my 7&10 yr olds can work out how to turn one on so can OPs 16yr old stepson. The duration is an excessive  waste of water and both parents should have nipped it in the bud years ago. Also I was raised if I could not be showed, dressed, hair done (or asked mum for help) and ready for school (minus breakfast) then I had to shower at night and that was from the age of 8.\n\nOP shouldn't have to suffer reduced sleep just because her husband and his ex failed to teach their son to be mindful of water usage, and respect for those around him.", "Unless he's got insanely long hair or a cleaning process that involves 40 products. 45 minutes of just standing there is still crazy long to just stand under the water. Even if you forget about time.\nTo soap hair and body. Rinse. Should not take more than 15 minutes max. \nAnd this is every single day. \n\nThen, as the others have said, he can get a timer. \nOr shower in the evening. \nHe knows OP has to get ready, too, so he can get a ride to school. \n\nI have two teens. One bathroom. And they could, on their own, figure out they can both brush teeth, do hair, etc, at the same time, so they both can have time for a quick morning shower (not together obviously) and ill still have time to get myself and the youngest done to leave the house on time.", "Or, the young man can get HIS tail out of bed an hour earlier, or do it in the evening...", "And how's poor Byron supposed to have his morning wank if you do that? ;)\n\n(yes, I absolutely agree with the point you're making)", "The morning shower may be necessary. However, it is NOT necessary (or good for the planet) to spend 45 minutes in the shower.", "He's rude as fuck and your husband is worthless. 15 minutes is plenty of time to shower. A 45-minute shower means he is shampooing and conditioning his hair, rubbing two out, then wasting water for twenty minutes. You don't need 45 minutes in the shower unless you're shaving your legs or just trying to piss off the other residents of the house.", "How often is he changing his sheets and sleepwear? \nDoes he need a new mattress and pillows?\nIs he vacuuming his room?\nIs he drinking enough water? \nDo you need to look into what food he is eating?\nIs he having night sweats?", "You tell him you need a shower by x am or you aren't driving him to school. If he steps out a second late you tell him \"looks like I won't have time to drive you buddy since I still need to shower\". I can't believe you keep putting up with this behavior. I wouldn't wake up 45 min early to drive my own kids to school", "Then help him to learn responsibility when he's in your house. My step kids aren't afraid of thunder or spiders at my house, but they are terrified of both at their mom's. They take insanely long showers/baths with her, but 5-10 minute showers at my house. They are 7 and 9. Their dad wasn't super interested in making them take short showers, as he takes long ones himself, so he and I had a chat about it and came to an agreement. Welcome to Dad's House Rules, where stepmom often has to step in to encourage dad to be the better parent, but it's all to benefit the kid(s) in the end.", "if its summer tho it wont help.", "My friend was just wondering about the location of the hot water valve off the water heater...", "Yes, mine is in the former carport, now converted to a room, and inaccessible. Which is why my plumbing is going to be completely rerouted......", "Would just tell him you are going in the shower first and he has 20 minutes once you get out to be ready or you are going without him. Then do it if necessary.\n\nAs a guy you can easily get showered in 5/10 minutes if you need to get a move on.", "Even as a woman I can do that with saving armpits and shampooing my hair."]}
