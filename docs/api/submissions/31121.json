However, the visitation agreement says we only have him every other weekend.\n\nByron's mother lives about 45 minutes from us, and Byron attends school near her apartment. I also happen to work in that area.\n\nOnce school resumed in person 2 years ago, I offered to take Byron to school so my husband wouldn't miss out on the extra time with him. Husband starts work at 5am, so visitation would have to go back to the agreement if I don't drive Byron to school.\n\nThis increases my already long commute by 15 minutes and I have to wake up at least 45 minutes earlier if I want access to the 1 bathroom we have. Byron takes 40-45 minute showers and gets out of the bathroom the time that we need to leave. Husband and Byron's mom won't make him be more courteous and take a shorter shower. This is just one example of a million that really annoys me. In my opinion, they do not hold Byron accountable for his actions, do not make him be responsible in any way, and treat him more like he's 5, not 16.\n\nWhen Byron turned 15 I started to get excited - now he can get his permit, eventually his license, and I get my sleep back. (Byron gets to school early currently due to my work start time, so he would wake up later if he drove himself). However, Byron is now well into being 16 (he turns 16 in the summer - a bit older than most his classmates), and still doesn't even have his permit. I've been talking to him about it since he turned 15, he seems like he is interested, read the book and everything, but his mom tells him he's \"not responsible enough, yet\". Husband won't push the topic with Byron's mom because he is worried about him driving. Important here: once you get out of our neighborhoods, it's a straight shot down one road with a 35MPH speed the entire way until you need to enter 25MPH neighborhoods again. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I told husband that I am not driving a 17/18 year old to school (so next year and after, I won't be). I feel this would give him plenty of time to get his permit and truth be told if he was working towards it I would drive him happily, no matter the age. The way I feel now, though, is they are not teaching Byron responsibility and honestly I feel taken advantage of by the fact that they just assume I'll continue doing it. However, Byron's mom thinks I'm selfish since I \"already work out there, anyways\".", "created_utc": 1700186389, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17x42tc/wibta_if_i_refuse_to_drive_my_stepkid_to_school/", "score": 117, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes, a stepparent is signing up to be involved but losing out on almost an hour of sleep a day is a major inconvenience to say the least. With no end in sight for years. None of them are bothered about it at all since it suits their own convenience. Give them notice that they need to make other arrangements. Don\u2019t get into \u201cthey should\u201d do this or that about his driving, that\u2019s not your place imo.

However you need to back off about Byron driving. Putting car keys in the hands of an irresponsible teenager is a horrible idea. If Byron\u2019s parents don\u2019t feel the he\u2019s responsible enough to drive, you need to respect that. They\u2019re the ones who are legally responsible for him, not you. Instead tell your husband that driving Byron to school yesterday is too much for you and it  would be better if he stayed with his mom on weekdays and stayed with you two every weekend.", "NAH I\u2019d offer to drive him only if he showers before bed. A 45 min am shower is ridiculous.", "NTA. He needs to grow the fuck up, and his actual parents need to parent him. Sounds like you've done a great job as a step-mum putting up with his annoying crap, and you've gone out of your way to take him to school for years so he and his dad can spend more time together. Unselfish. Time for them all to grow up a lil", "You are NTA for feeling like Byron\u2019s transportation isn\u2019t your responsibility because YOU\u2019RE RIGHT.  \n\nBut remember why you offered to do this in the fist place - for YOUR HUSBAND  - so that he\u2019d get the gift of extra time with his son.

Anyone who spends 45min in the only bathroom in the morning is selfish.", "Your sacrifices and inconveniences should at least be respected and supported if the kid wants you to drive him to school, OK?\n\nI applaud you for wanting to help your husband out.

No way. They can sit down and work something out and give you a break.", "Solid ESH and soft YTA - the way I see it, you\u2019re punishing him for the decisions of his bio parents. While you don\u2019t want to give in to them allowing him to avoid responsibility, it\u2019s also true that they may be correct (and you yourself has stated) he *is* irresponsible and maybe shouldn\u2019t have a car / permit yet. It seems like the primary reason for your interest in this would be your own conveniences and while I totally understand wanting more sleep and an easier morning routine, it might not be what\u2019s best for Byron at this time. The bio parents suck because they need to hold him to higher standards of responsibility and encourage his confidence in growing up and becoming a man. You suck because it seems driving him is more of a minor inconvenience and not doing it would result in your husband seeing his son significantly less (and son seeing dad less). All around that sounds like a lose-lose. It seems like the best way you can support your step son right now is to continue driving him and discuss with his *parents* NOT with the child, that he needs to be actively working towards goals in order for you to want to continue helping him. This is a conversation for the parents and all 3 of you need to be on the same page in order to co parent successfully.", "ESH and a little YTA. \n\nWhen ppl get married, you\u2019re bringing two different mindsets and upbringings together. It\u2019s super bumpy. Toss in a kid, and you\u2019re on a wooden rollercoaster. Toss in remarriage, you\u2019re now at three upbringings. \n\nSadly often feelings and emotions get in the way of the effective communication and comprehension. It turns into a \u201cwinner takes all\u201d energy, vs a collaborative space. \n\nI took a course and one thing that stood out, your feelings are real, but feelings aren\u2019t reality. What you\u2019re feeling isn\u2019t what your husband is feeling isn\u2019t what the ex wife is feeling and isn\u2019t what the son is feeling. Extract all the feelings, and you\u2019ll see what\u2019s really nagging at you. And then that can be addressed. \n\nSingle dad here. My previous relationship, I told my partner I have a kid and he\u2019s with me 50% of the time. Is this something they\u2019re ok with. After they said yes. I said great. When we started discussing moving in together, it would be as a family. And we sat down again and said let\u2019s discuss what you imagine to be the living and parenting situation. Cause one thing I know. I\u2019m not gonna sit here while some person rips at everything my kids doing wrong while. It celebrating his successes and assisting in developing then to be a good human. Know what you\u2019re signing up for, cause there are enough shitty kids from divorced households out there. \n\nYou all need to communicate. If you want him to get his license, then step up. Or stop complaining. Why is it that it feels like you\u2019re a bystander when it comes to that, but are in the middle of it to make it happen on your schedule. The fact that you said you\u2019d drive him if he was working towards it, but not if he isn\u2019t, means that you\u2019re ok giving up your sleep on your conditions. Which is fine.

That's not helping him to chauffeur him. He needs to get his license soon/now. Take it from someone who has two offspring both over 18 that still have to be chauffeured. Not fun.
