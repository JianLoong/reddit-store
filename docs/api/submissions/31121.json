However, the visitation agreement says we only have him every other weekend.\n\nByron's mother lives about 45 minutes from us, and Byron attends school near her apartment. I also happen to work in that area.\n\nOnce school resumed in person 2 years ago, I offered to take Byron to school so my husband wouldn't miss out on the extra time with him. Husband starts work at 5am, so visitation would have to go back to the agreement if I don't drive Byron to school.\n\nThis increases my already long commute by 15 minutes and I have to wake up at least 45 minutes earlier if I want access to the 1 bathroom we have. Byron takes 40-45 minute showers and gets out of the bathroom the time that we need to leave. Husband and Byron's mom won't make him be more courteous and take a shorter shower. This is just one example of a million that really annoys me. In my opinion, they do not hold Byron accountable for his actions, do not make him be responsible in any way, and treat him more like he's 5, not 16.\n\nWhen Byron turned 15 I started to get excited - now he can get his permit, eventually his license, and I get my sleep back. (Byron gets to school early currently due to my work start time, so he would wake up later if he drove himself). However, Byron is now well into being 16 (he turns 16 in the summer - a bit older than most his classmates), and still doesn't even have his permit. I've been talking to him about it since he turned 15, he seems like he is interested, read the book and everything, but his mom tells him he's \"not responsible enough, yet\". Husband won't push the topic with Byron's mom because he is worried about him driving. Important here: once you get out of our neighborhoods, it's a straight shot down one road with a 35MPH speed the entire way until you need to enter 25MPH neighborhoods again. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I told husband that I am not driving a 17/18 year old to school (so next year and after, I won't be). I feel this would give him plenty of time to get his permit and truth be told if he was working towards it I would drive him happily, no matter the age. The way I feel now, though, is they are not teaching Byron responsibility and honestly I feel taken advantage of by the fact that they just assume I'll continue doing it.

It seems like the primary reason for your interest in this would be your own conveniences and while I totally understand wanting more sleep and an easier morning routine, it might not be what\u2019s best for Byron at this time. The bio parents suck because they need to hold him to higher standards of responsibility and encourage his confidence in growing up and becoming a man. You suck because it seems driving him is more of a minor inconvenience and not doing it would result in your husband seeing his son significantly less (and son seeing dad less). All around that sounds like a lose-lose. It seems like the best way you can support your step son right now is to continue driving him and discuss with his *parents* NOT with the child, that he needs to be actively working towards goals in order for you to want to continue helping him.

It turns into a \u201cwinner takes all\u201d energy, vs a collaborative space. \n\nI took a course and one thing that stood out, your feelings are real, but feelings aren\u2019t reality. What you\u2019re feeling isn\u2019t what your husband is feeling isn\u2019t what the ex wife is feeling and isn\u2019t what the son is feeling.

My previous relationship, I told my partner I have a kid and he\u2019s with me 50% of the time. Is this something they\u2019re ok with. After they said yes. I said great. When we started discussing moving in together, it would be as a family. And we sat down again and said let\u2019s discuss what you imagine to be the living and parenting situation. Cause one thing I know. I\u2019m not gonna sit here while some person rips at everything my kids doing wrong while. It celebrating his successes and assisting in developing then to be a good human. Know what you\u2019re signing up for, cause there are enough shitty kids from divorced households out there. \n\nYou all need to communicate. If you want him to get his license, then step up. Or stop complaining. Why is it that it feels like you\u2019re a bystander when it comes to that, but are in the middle of it to make it happen on your schedule. The fact that you said you\u2019d drive him if he was working towards it, but not if he isn\u2019t, means that you\u2019re ok giving up your sleep on your conditions. Which is fine.

Driving considerations aside, I think it's fine for you to say you are not driving stepson to school next year at all or say you will not unless something gives.

That's why I worry that maybe it would be selfish to stop.\n\nIn speaking with my husband, he has told me he will figure it out if I stop driving him, but I know that it hurts and upsets him because there really are no other options than to not have him during the week anymore, if he doesn't drive himself. I understand my husbands fears, any parent would have them and I understand why he doesn't push so hard on the long showers. He has tried, but without going to things people have suggested (shutting off hot water, leaving with him to figure it out, etc.) nothing worked, and honestly, my husband gives up easy. He's also not there to try to deal with it in the morning, since he's at work.

I can also see ways in which a parent gets support from the other, which my husband doesn't have and there's a disconnect when I try to do it, which I understand why, truly. He does coddle him, and I've told him this, suggested things small, but my husband thinks because \"he's not my son\" is the only reason I feel that way, when I think it's more of my husband feels this way becuase he is his son and he doesn't have his son's mom to support him - she tears him down any time he has tried to make Byron somewhat independent.
