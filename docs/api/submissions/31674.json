He lives with my grandparents and has always been at family gatherings. I've never had any issues with him until the last two or three years. \n\nGrowing up, my family used to live very close to a lot of my extended family. Around the time I had turned 13, my family moved a couple hours away. We saw family a lot less often after the move, not on purpose of course, just life getting busier as people get older I guess. I'm in college now which makes it even more difficult. I really only see my extended family during the end of the year holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years). So I only really see my uncle then. \n\nI'm not sure when it exactly started, but my uncle has started to make comments about wanting to marry me. Specifically saying, \"marry you, marry you\". It makes me a little uncomfortable. I think what makes me more uncomfortable is that my dad always laughs about it and encourages him. This now happens every time I'm near my uncle, it feel like it's the only thing he'll say to me. This has now extended to me not wanting him to touch me. He has come up to me and put and arm around me or a hand on my shoulder while saying he wants to marry me. So I've just kind of been avoiding him during visits.\n\nMy mom took notice at Thanksgiving. My uncle is her younger brother, and she is fiercely protective of him. She confronted me in the car driving home (in front of all of my other siblings) asking why I avoid him. I told her essentially what I typed above. She and my Dad don't understand why that would make me uncomfortable. They have both said that it shouldn't bother me because he doesn't understand what he's saying, \"his mind is like a 5 year olds\" and \"he says stuff like that to everyone\". Which could be true, I haven't seen him interact with any of my female cousins in a while, but it doesn't change the fact that I still feel uncomfortable about the situation. \n\nI worry that my mom thinks I hate my uncle, and that kind of offends me. I've known him my entire life! I absolutely do not hate him, and I understand that he doesn't understand what he says most of the time. I told my mom that it's just something I'll deal with and get over, but I fear she thinks the worst of me. I know it's not a very nice thing to do, but I didn't know what else I could do to stop the \"marry you\" talk.

Maybe you can find a quiet time to discuss your feelings with your mom? She may be protective of her brother, but she should also be protective of her daughter.

Some of the folks in my group home have lived with family their entire lives. Unfortunately, sometimes family feels the need to overly cater to the disabled person, using the same mentality you\u2019ve described. \u201cBob doesn\u2019t understand, Bob has the mind of a five year old.\u201d Unfortunately, what happens is that Bob learns that it\u2019s not only ok, but even cute to do things that make people uncomfortable. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll give you a real life example. Bob goes to a football game to cheer on his high school team. Bob really likes the cheerleaders, and starts asking for their attention. He asks to take selfies with them, asks them to autograph his program, and even asks for phone numbers. Now, if Bob were 12, this could be cute. It\u2019s not cute if Bob is 34 years old, 6 ft 2, and has 3 days of stubble. Jennifer the cheerleader starts getting really creeped out, and tells her coach, who alerts the police officer at the game. Or Jennifer tells either her dad or boyfriend, who is not happy. Now Bob is getting his ass kicked by Jennifer\u2019s dad/brother/boyfriend. Or Bob is getting a serious talking to from a police officer. Family is doing a disservice to Bob by not teaching him what is appropriate vs inappropriate. \n\nDoes your uncle pick his nose in public? Does he play with his genitals in public? No? Why not? Im guessing someone explained to him that those actions are inappropriate. If so, your uncle is perfectly capable of understanding that this behavior towards you is also inappropriate.

By not teaching him what's appropriate, he is going to continue this behaviour even outside your family unit and will also make people who don't know him feel unsafe too. It's better to learn the lesson from his big sis, than to learn the lesson from the police.

Men were all \"my best friend\" he did these with family, friends, favourite actors and singers. It was his language for \"I really care/like you\" which is fine, but we always defined the relationship or verbalised what he ment \"is he your favourite singer\" Saying he's wanting to marry you maybe the only way he knows to express how much he's missed you and how much he likes you. Next time he says it I'd answer \"you can't marry me, I'm your niece\" do it with a smile/lighthearted then redirect the conversation to one of his interests.

My late father didn't really give her rules or anything and because of that my sister is a brat that I want nothing to do with. I told my mom I would put her in a group home when she is gone because I can't stand my sister. After all she would prevent me from working and traveling if I had to care for her. \n\nEven 4 or 5 year olds can told rules and be made to listen. Glass children like me wouldn't exist if parents actually did their due diligence.", "my favorite waiter at a local diner had downs. my mom ordered something with a lot of specifications and he said \"you got it!\" nudged my stepdad and said, \"hey, women are dragons, right?\" we used to quote that all the time. loved that guy", "I get what you mean, but whilst I'd agree in spoken form, in written form, it's, at worst, a little clumsy... but definitely not malicious in my opinion", "That's deeply screwed up.", "Because they conflate disability with non-sexuality.

If my two-year-old says or does something that makes someone uncomfortable, I let him know. We talk about why it isn't okay, and we work on him not doing it again. It isn't a perfect system (we're still working on not making the cat make funny noises by hitting her) but there's no \"he's too young mentally to understand\". I have not worked extensively with individuals with down syndrome, but this is not appropriate for your family to encourage at all.", "NTA. Your family is putting you at risk and putting you in an uncomfortable situation. They could gently dissuade your uncle. They are also failing your uncle as it\u2019s clear no one is supervising/guiding him and he\u2019s touching you without consent.

THAT would make me uncomfortable for sure when he's speaking & acting like this!!", "Exactly! I wish every parent understood this.", "I find \"That's not appropriate behaviour and I do not want to be around someone who says things that make me uncomfortable\" works well. Follow with \"I do not want to be touched\" or \"Do not touch me without my consent\". It can help drive the point home. I've found that making it about the behaviour being gross just causes them to get angry and have shame they don't know how to process, which makes them angrier and less able to understand your words. Making it clear (loudly) that what they are saying/doing is not ok while explaining that it will cause people to not want to interact with them works well. The sooner you de-escalate the situation, the better. \n\n\nAlthough their comment/action *is* gross, emphasizing how it makes you feel and what the consequences are goes further and de-escalates. When emotions are high and someone feels like they are being attacked/rejected, they are more likely to be violent and uncontrollable. \"Ew, you are gross\" and \"Get away from me!\" don't work on someone who does not have the life skills or emotional maturity to process the rejection and calmly respond. \"That is not appropriate behaviour\" conveys the same thing but is less likely to cause them to lash out.\n\nSource: Have been around people with severe cognitive disabilities my whole life and have done a lot of respite work with disabled adults.", "Omg.

There is a difficulty here w trisomy 21 in their 40s, in that Alzheimer\u2019s disease is very common in that age group, and inappropriate behavior can develop in the same way as it can in people decades older w only 2 copies of chromosome 21. There can be people in both of those age groups where you didn\u2019t have to worry and now you do.", "You make it sound like they are actual people with individual interests! What's next, teaching them about boundaries, healthy relationships, and consent? Teaching them about *gasp* their own bodies? /s\n\nThe amount of infantilizing is absolutely disgusting.
