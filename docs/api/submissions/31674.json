He lives with my grandparents and has always been at family gatherings. I've never had any issues with him until the last two or three years. \n\nGrowing up, my family used to live very close to a lot of my extended family. Around the time I had turned 13, my family moved a couple hours away. We saw family a lot less often after the move, not on purpose of course, just life getting busier as people get older I guess. I'm in college now which makes it even more difficult. I really only see my extended family during the end of the year holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years). So I only really see my uncle then. \n\nI'm not sure when it exactly started, but my uncle has started to make comments about wanting to marry me. Specifically saying, \"marry you, marry you\". It makes me a little uncomfortable. I think what makes me more uncomfortable is that my dad always laughs about it and encourages him. This now happens every time I'm near my uncle, it feel like it's the only thing he'll say to me. This has now extended to me not wanting him to touch me. He has come up to me and put and arm around me or a hand on my shoulder while saying he wants to marry me. So I've just kind of been avoiding him during visits.\n\nMy mom took notice at Thanksgiving. My uncle is her younger brother, and she is fiercely protective of him. She confronted me in the car driving home (in front of all of my other siblings) asking why I avoid him. I told her essentially what I typed above. She and my Dad don't understand why that would make me uncomfortable. They have both said that it shouldn't bother me because he doesn't understand what he's saying, \"his mind is like a 5 year olds\" and \"he says stuff like that to everyone\". Which could be true, I haven't seen him interact with any of my female cousins in a while, but it doesn't change the fact that I still feel uncomfortable about the situation. \n\nI worry that my mom thinks I hate my uncle, and that kind of offends me. I've known him my entire life! I absolutely do not hate him, and I understand that he doesn't understand what he says most of the time. I told my mom that it's just something I'll deal with and get over, but I fear she thinks the worst of me. I know it's not a very nice thing to do, but I didn't know what else I could do to stop the \"marry you\" talk.

Some of the folks in my group home have lived with family their entire lives. Unfortunately, sometimes family feels the need to overly cater to the disabled person, using the same mentality you\u2019ve described. \u201cBob doesn\u2019t understand, Bob has the mind of a five year old.\u201d Unfortunately, what happens is that Bob learns that it\u2019s not only ok, but even cute to do things that make people uncomfortable. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll give you a real life example. Bob goes to a football game to cheer on his high school team. Bob really likes the cheerleaders, and starts asking for their attention. He asks to take selfies with them, asks them to autograph his program, and even asks for phone numbers. Now, if Bob were 12, this could be cute. It\u2019s not cute if Bob is 34 years old, 6 ft 2, and has 3 days of stubble. Jennifer the cheerleader starts getting really creeped out, and tells her coach, who alerts the police officer at the game. Or Jennifer tells either her dad or boyfriend, who is not happy. Now Bob is getting his ass kicked by Jennifer\u2019s dad/brother/boyfriend. Or Bob is getting a serious talking to from a police officer. Family is doing a disservice to Bob by not teaching him what is appropriate vs inappropriate. \n\nDoes your uncle pick his nose in public? Does he play with his genitals in public? No? Why not? Im guessing someone explained to him that those actions are inappropriate. If so, your uncle is perfectly capable of understanding that this behavior towards you is also inappropriate.

By not teaching him what's appropriate, he is going to continue this behaviour even outside your family unit and will also make people who don't know him feel unsafe too. It's better to learn the lesson from his big sis, than to learn the lesson from the police.

It was his language for \"I really care/like you\" which is fine, but we always defined the relationship or verbalised what he ment \"is he your favourite singer\" Saying he's wanting to marry you maybe the only way he knows to express how much he's missed you and how much he likes you.

Something like no bud, you can't marry X, this is your niece, and redirect him. Over and over until he gets it. You deserve to be able to spend time with extended family without feeling uncomfortable. Your mom and dad are AHs if they can't understand that", "NTA your right to feel uncomfortable", "NTA\u2026 I work with adults with special needs, including people with Down\u2019s syndrome. Some of the folks in my group home have lived with family their entire lives. Unfortunately, sometimes family feels the need to overly cater to the disabled person, using the same mentality you\u2019ve described. \u201cBob doesn\u2019t understand, Bob has the mind of a five year old.\u201d Unfortunately, what happens is that Bob learns that it\u2019s not only ok, but even cute to do things that make people uncomfortable.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "He does not have the mind of a 5 year old. He has the cognitive understanding of a child along with the sexual urges of an adult.\n\nMy friend constantly had to monitor the boys with Downs syndrome when they came to the pool where he worked as a life-guard because they would corner young girls and pull out their penises and play with themselves. \n\nYour father is a fool and your mother is an enabler.\n\nWhy the heck do they think he wants you as his wife? BECAUSE OF HIS ADULT FEELINGS.", "They should have discouraged this for several reasons, with the most prominent one being that this is hurting OP now, today.  Future worries about how he might respond to OP\u2019s theoretical future partner should not be the main worry here.  A valid concern, sure, but let\u2019s not ignore the young woman being hurt today in favor of the possibility of injury to someone else tomorrow.", "Exactly, it's a disservice to special needs people to not make the effort to teach them social rules. People compare them to children as a way of saying it doesn't matter, but the reason we let these silly things go with actual children is because we know they'll eventually grow out of it. Someone with Downs will not; unless we help them correct the behavior and replace it with something more appropriate, they'll continue and even escalate it until they eventually get themselves in trouble. And that's not fair to anyone.", "Exactly! Plus his mind may be 5 years old, but his body is an adult body and has urges just like any adult body does but with less ability to understand what those urges are and how to handle them. There are often disabled adults who have been allowed to grope people and harass people because the family makes excuses. And all they are doing is setting up the disabled family member for trouble in the future. And whoever their poor victims are.", "This is so perfectly explained", "This comment should be higher.", "The guy's known OP since she was born. Most likely held her as a baby...", "This is\u2026 not the answer\n\nI agree that OP is NTA, and that the parents are the problem here. The way they\u2019re handling this is insulting to everyone involved \u2014 minimizing their daughter\u2019s feelings and infantilizing their brother/brother-in-law.\n\nBut given how they\u2019ve already reacted, saying \u201cI think he\u2019s going to m_lest/r_pe me and I\u2019ll blame you if that happens\u201d is just going to make things worse. If OP phrases it like that, they\u2019re likely to do 2 things\u2026\n\n1. Get defensive (\u201cI\u2019ll blame you if that happens\u201d)\n\n2. Argue that she\u2019s in the wrong for even suggesting that could happen (since they\u2019re infantilizing OP\u2019s uncle, I doubt that they\u2019ll even believe he\u2019s capable of m_lestation/r_pe)\n\nNeither of those things are going to help OP resolve the situation.\n\nAnd setting all of that aside\u2026 has OP indicated that she believes that to be a potential outcome of this situation?? That she believes this will progress to s_xual v__lence?? Unless I\u2019m missing something, this is a really strange thing to suggest **with no statement that OP feels this way**, in addition to it being a bad idea overall.\n\nAs for the second part, there are a few problems.\n\n1. If OP does not currently have a partner, building this explanation on a lie is a bad idea AND unfair to OP.\n\n2. There\u2019s no guarantee of how OP\u2019s uncle will react, especially since his own family seems to have been reinforcing this idea that he is going to marry OP. This approach has the potential to cause a lot of harm/upset to OP and her uncle.\n\n3. Most importantly, **even this plan works, OP\u2019s uncle will still not understand why his comments/behavior were inappropriate in the first place**. And in fact this has the potential to introduce or reinforce even *more* harmful ideas about respecting women\u2019s partners but not the women themselves.\n\nI understand what you\u2019re trying to do, but these responses feel over-the-top and likely to cause more harm than good. From OP\u2019s post, it sounds like her parents caused this problem, but this isn\u2019t a situation where she\u2019s interested in cutting off her parents or doing anything else that\u2019s particularly drastic. Their responses have already shown that they\u2019re likely to get defensive. Approaching them in a manner that\u2019s basically guaranteed to provoke them is a bad idea. And attempting to move past this issue without really addressing it is not going to work either. \n\nOP and her parents need to have a calm conversation about how this is affecting OP and what can be done to fix things, and then OP\u2019s parents (and anyone else who has been encouraging this behavior from OP\u2019s uncle) need to sit down with OP\u2019s uncle and help him understand not only that he should not make these comments and touch OP without her consent, but *why* he can\u2019t do those things.\n\nEDIT: format", "Why, it isn't disrespectful and it is relevant to the post, stating that someone has a disability, who actually has the disabiliy, is not ableist, it's simply factual, and in this context is appropriate as for all we know OP might have lots of uncles, and the normal way to separate them, by name, would be partially doxxing him...", "This is true, people with Down\u00b4s are not helpless children, and allowing behaviors like this (or worse, acting like it is cute) actually does them a disservice because they don\u00b4t learn social behavior. It sets them up for unhappiness and feeling rejected when people get uncomfortable and don\u00b4t want to be around them.\n\nPart of respect for those with disabilities is acknowledging that they are adults and capable of making good choices just like people without disabilities.\n\nEdit: OP is NTA", ">Bob has the mind of a five year old.\n\nPeople teach 5 year old children all kinds of things. So I really don't understand that excuse. Also a lot of Down's syndrome people are more capable than little children. Not sure if that is the case here, but it is possible that they totally underestimate the uncle which would make them bigger AH for not teaching him things.", "> So, I\u2019ll give you a real life example. Bob goes to a football game to cheer on his high school team. Bob really likes the cheerleaders, and starts asking for their attention. He asks to take selfies with them, asks them to autograph his program, and even asks for phone numbers. Now, if Bob were 12, this could be cute. It\u2019s not cute if Bob is 34 years old, 6 ft 2, and has 3 days of stubble. Jennifer the cheerleader starts getting really creeped out, and tells her coach, who alerts the police officer at the game. Or Jennifer tells either her dad or boyfriend, who is not happy. Now Bob is getting his ass kicked by Jennifer\u2019s dad/brother/boyfriend. Or Bob is getting a serious talking to from a police officer. Family is doing a disservice to Bob by not teaching him what is appropriate vs inappropriate.", "Right! Having the mind of a five-year-old isn't an excuse for inappropriate behavior. If your five-year-old does something wrong you don't say \"oh, it's ok, he's only five, he doesn't know any better\" and let him go on doing it, you tell them that what they did was inappropriate, explain why, and tell them not to do it again. Five-year-olds can *learn*, and so can adults with the mind of a five-year-old. He's old enough to understand that other people have feelings.", "Bad bot! Copied from r/MistressOfChaos98", "OP\u2019s family should learn about Robert Ethan Saylor. He was a man with Down syndrome who threw a tantrum at a movie theater. Three cops moonlighting as security suffocated him to death, similar to how George Floyd was killed a decade later.\n\nIf the uncle\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t dealt with by the family. He could scare someone in public who gets the police involved.", "NTA OP my stepmom is a DSW and you can absolutely teach people with Downs that they\u2019re not being \u201cnice\u201d. When I was in Hs on the (city) bus to school was the friendliest man I\u2019ve ever met who was always on his way to work at McDonald\u2019s, I\u2019m sure he learned you can\u2019t harass people while he was being taught enough independence to have a job.", "I hate when people pull the 'mind of a 5yo' card with disabled people. Like, somehow, at 5, people aren't capable of being gently corrected or discouraged from bad behavior. \ud83d\ude44 They just need help to know what's inappropriate. Encouraging them because it's 'funny' really is a disservice to everyone involved. In this case, OP is a young female relative who is being harassed and made to feel uncomfortable, probably in large part because her father or other relatives think it's funny or cute and the uncle picks up on that and thinks he's doing the right thing, or at least that it's ok. The long-term effect is that his niece and possibly other younger female relatives are going to start avoiding him. Or the uncle takes the joke too far at some point.", "[removed]", ">they would corner young girls and pull out their penises and play with themselves. \n\n\ud83d\ude28", "I agree the fact that OP is uncomfortable should be the main concern here, but her parents have already shown they are not willing to care about that.\nApproaching it from an alternate angle may actually have a chance of getting through to them.", "I hate when I see this so much! It's doing them such a disservice and actually speaks more to how ableist the families are by believing their family member with disabilities is not capable of learning. Often the families just can't be bothered putting the effort in. \n\nI have worked with adults with learning disabilities who have ended up sexually assaulting someone. Do they have capacity to understand it's wrong? Often not depending on the severity. Is the trauma any less for the victim? Absolutely not. \n\nOP you are absolutely NTA and your family need to do better teaching your uncle about appropriate relationships.", "Fucking this. I work in retail and I've had my fair share of uncomfortable customer encounters, but in one place I used to work I would frequently get disabled people come in with their carers. I was never sure what the disabilities were, whether some had DS or something else, that was never relevant. But a few times, one of them would make comments about me that made me incredibly uncomfortable. He'd come to the front counter and just state, \"you're my girlfriend\". His carer would encourage it, like, \"Do you think she's pretty? Is the nice lady pretty, is that why she's your girlfriend?\" and I'm just... stood there awkwardly waiting for this to stop so I can ask if they want a bag for their purchase. Like, why am I expected to smile and nod along with this just because he happens to have a disability?", "Or the cop ends up harming or even killing Bob."]}
