{"id": 31674, "submission_id": "183ciq6", "title": "AITA for avoiding my down syndrome uncle", "selftext": "I (22F) have been avoiding my down syndrome uncle (46M) at recent family gatherings.\n\nI have known my uncle my entire life. He lives with my grandparents and has always been at family gatherings. I've never had any issues with him until the last two or three years. \n\nGrowing up, my family used to live very close to a lot of my extended family. Around the time I had turned 13, my family moved a couple hours away. We saw family a lot less often after the move, not on purpose of course, just life getting busier as people get older I guess. I'm in college now which makes it even more difficult. I really only see my extended family during the end of the year holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years). So I only really see my uncle then. \n\nI'm not sure when it exactly started, but my uncle has started to make comments about wanting to marry me. Specifically saying, \"marry you, marry you\". It makes me a little uncomfortable. I think what makes me more uncomfortable is that my dad always laughs about it and encourages him. This now happens every time I'm near my uncle, it feel like it's the only thing he'll say to me. This has now extended to me not wanting him to touch me. He has come up to me and put and arm around me or a hand on my shoulder while saying he wants to marry me. So I've just kind of been avoiding him during visits.\n\nMy mom took notice at Thanksgiving. My uncle is her younger brother, and she is fiercely protective of him. She confronted me in the car driving home (in front of all of my other siblings) asking why I avoid him. I told her essentially what I typed above. She and my Dad don't understand why that would make me uncomfortable. They have both said that it shouldn't bother me because he doesn't understand what he's saying, \"his mind is like a 5 year olds\" and \"he says stuff like that to everyone\". Which could be true, I haven't seen him interact with any of my female cousins in a while, but it doesn't change the fact that I still feel uncomfortable about the situation. \n\nI worry that my mom thinks I hate my uncle, and that kind of offends me. I've known him my entire life! I absolutely do not hate him, and I understand that he doesn't understand what he says most of the time. I told my mom that it's just something I'll deal with and get over, but I fear she thinks the worst of me. I know it's not a very nice thing to do, but I didn't know what else I could do to stop the \"marry you\" talk.

First and foremost you do not need to put yourself in an uncomfortable situation or not enforce your boundries just because someone is disabled. But also your parents are ignorant and even ablist.\nThey are doing more harm than good to both you and your uncle by infantilizing him and treating him like he is incapable of understanding anything or practicing self restrain. \nPeople with down syndrome are adults, capable of reason and self restrain, plus they've gone through puberty and have phisiological desires too. He is not a 5 year old with a crush on a Disney Princess.", "NTA.  Your dad encouraged this?  What the hell?!  Your parents should have been gently and kindly discouraging this.  They made the problem worse and are now pretending nothing can be done about it.  If, from the start, they have behaved with concern for your comfort and wellbeing, I expect it would have been quite obvious that you did NOT like this or want this, and they could have encouraged him in other directions.  They played a significant part in making this \u201cjoke\u201d fun for your uncle, and thus are largely responsible for it becoming such a big part in his interactions with you.", "NTA. Your uncle seems to focus all of his attention on you.  Anyone who genuinely cares for your uncle should worry about this. In spite of having Down\u2019s that doesn\u2019t mean his feelings  and thoughts and affections aren\u2019t engaged.  Your mom has no idea what he has built up in his mind.  He may at some point decide you two are engaged.\n\nYour family should discourage this for one reason. - how will he react when you bring a boyfriend or partner around?\n\nThey have no idea how he will react to that, but I bet it isn\u2019t great if he thinks you are his.  Your family needs to nip this now.", "Agreed with others. Your family should be explaining to your uncle that he can\u2019t Marry you, not encouraging it. NTA and your family is TA for not seemingly caring about your discomfort", "Nta it\u2019s weird no one has corrected him and explained that you can\u2019t marry family. What\u2019s going to happen when you get a romantic partner and bring them to family gatherings? This could result in a pretty bad meltdown and possibly damage the family\u2019s relationships", "NTA \n\nPeople with Down Syndrome do tend to be extremely affectionate. If his mind is that of a 5 year old, him wanting to marry you is understandable. It's also probably because he doesn't see you as much as your other cousins. That being said, yes he does look like a grown man and he's twice your age so your discomfort is understandable. You do have a right to not be touched by anyone you don't want. Maybe you can find a quiet time to discuss your feelings with your mom? She may be protective of her brother, but she should also be protective of her daughter. Your father encouraging it is very insulting to his brother in law. He's patronizing the man. Also, a 5 yr old brain is advanced enough to be explained things.", "NTA- just because he doesn\u2019t understand, doesn\u2019t mean he wouldn\u2019t understand if it was explained. They can teach him that it is not appropriate to say to family , and explain why like you would to a 5 year old. They need to stop downplaying harassment just because of his condition, uncomfortable and unwarranted comments or gestures is never ok for anyone ever. Regardless of their condition.", "NTA, as someone already said, you have the right not to be touched by someone else. It actually seems like what you did by politely avoiding him was probably the best thing to do, because then you're not upsetting him and also respecting your own personal space.\n\nWhat's the alternative? You just have to endure this indisputably uncomfortable behaviour while your dad eggs him on? That's fucked up.", "NTA.\n\nThe problem is not you or your uncle. It's your mum and dad. Tell them at the rate your uncle is progressing with his affection,  you're getting the vibe he's gonna moleste or rape you one day, and if they don't believe you, you'll blame them if it happens. Then, hopefully, your dad will stop encouraging it. \n\nThey should start telling him nicely thatyou have a boyfriend and will marry your boyfriend one day. Stop him thinking that he'll marry you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
