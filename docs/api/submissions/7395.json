{"id": 7395, "submission_id": "10cjfn2", "title": "AITA for telling my mom \"then maybe you should work harder\" in a moment of frustration.", "selftext": "A year ago, I, 18M, got a new laptop. It was the first laptop I've ever owned that actually belonged to me alone. The only reason I was able to get that laptop was because my step dad got into a car accident and got a huge amount of money from insurance. I never would have asked for it if we couldn't afford it at the time.\n\nThe laptop was one of the best things I owned. I got into tons of new hobbies: gaming, 3d modelling, art, game design, film editing, etc. It was also my only source of income at all. Well, around a month ago, one of my siblings destroyed my laptop. It's basically unusable now and I definitely can't ask for a new one because we can't afford it.\n\nI decided to look online to see if there were ways for me to possibly crowdfund a new one. So for the past month, Ive been trying to see if I could use platforms like gofundme or Kickstarter and the bunch to raise money (can't due to immigration issues). I wasn't expecting anyone online to actually donate but at least it could just be a thing I could show friends and family during holidays like \"hey what do you want for Christmas?\" \"oh um I'm trying to save up for a new computer, do you mind donating to this?\" yknow? \n\nWell about 2 days ago, I came across a site named Ko-fi. I was ecstatic because I didn't need an SSN to make an account. So I quickly made one and went to tell my mom out of excitement.\n\nI thought she'd be happy that I was trying to find a way to afford something nice for myself without bothering her but I was so wrong. She basically cursed me out for \"asking for handouts online\" and \"making her look like a charity case\". I tried to explain that it wasn't like that and that people online might never even come across it and it could just be a thing between friends and family but she wasn't having it. She kept going on and on about how I'm \"begging online\" and \"making her look like a bad parent to all these strangers\".  \n\nIt just really hurt to hear all that at the time. She then said that now I'm making her feel like she has to work harder to provide for our needs and that's when I said \"then maybe you should work harder. go on. go out and work more to pay for this with your job that can't even get us Christmas gifts much less a new computer\". \n\nI was pretty frustrated at this point because she was just yelling and cursing. When I get frustrated, I also cry \"mad tears\" but I didn't want her to see that because she'll take it as a sign of her words getting through or something so I just blurted out whatever I could to try to get a bit of the frustration out. \n\nShe hasnt talked to me since then. I didn't even know my mom could be so quiet. My mom's friend said she was pretty hurt by what I said but she hurt me too in that moment.\n\nSo reddit, AITA? Should I just suck it up and go apologize to her, which could possibly mean her asking me to put aside my donation thing for her image?\n\nEdit: A lot of people keep asking questions like why I can't get a job, among with many other things. I posted an update of sorts on my profile to explain everything else you might wanna know because the text limit here is so small. Here it is: [More info](https://www.reddit.com/user/Conscious-Ad8626/comments/10cvsde/update_aita_for_telling_my_mom_then_maybe_you/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nEdit 2: I was working a little before all this. I did quite a bit of video editing among other things. My laptop was my only source of income because I couldn't get a real job. I would have used the little savings I got from video editing but I gave them all to her since the moment she started trying to get us a better apartment. I explain this better on my update post on my account.\n\nEdit 3: Mann y'all are something else. To the people who have offered kind words, support and resources to help, especially with immigration issues, thank you so much!\n\nEdit 4: Guys, ive explained all this in another post but tldr, I havent been just sitting on my butt all day expecting handouts. Ive always wanted to work and be independent. Even in middle school, I'd do people's homework for $5 even with the threat of getting caught. My mom never allowed me to do jobs like babysitting or car washing because she saw it as harmful to \"her image\". She has always been restrictive and over protective. When I say my laptop was my only source of income I mean it was my ONLY source mostly because everything was online, she didn't need to know all I did and I didn't need to leave the house to work which I wasn't even allowed to. I only turned 18 in November and then my dreams of getting a real job as an adult were crushed after learning of our immigration issues and such so yeah.\n\nEdit 5: Chill out guys. I turned 18 in November. Ive only been an adult for 2 months and am still trying to figure out the whole adulting thing", "created_utc": 1673787999, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10cjfn2/aita_for_telling_my_mom_then_maybe_you_should/", "score": 1012, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The whole she won't allow it is just baffling...not saying that she isn't an AH but WHY do you allow it to happen?\n\nDo you have friends on the 'outside' or other relatives?  Make arrangements to bail on Mommy Dearest, get a job, and find somewhere else, anywhere else to live.  Take a very deep breath and make it happen.", "YTA but so is your mom to an extent for putting her image ahead of your needs. You were using that for work. If you can't work and make money, you can't just save for a new one on your own. Either someone has to buy it for you, or you need to seek other solutions, which you did.\n\nWith that said, I'm sure your mom is facing a lot of challenges and your words were very hurtful. TAH or not, you should apologize and just let her know you recognize her struggles and were just frustrated in the moment. Acknowledge that you should have been more responsible in the first place to avoid damage to something that was so expensive and valuable to your work and you know that you were at the root of this problem and taking it out on her. Because that's honestly what this one boils down to. Taking responsibility it one of the suckier parts of adulthood, but you will grow from it and it absolutely is necessary.", "ESH. Even without the current immigration issue you're facing, its become harder for *many* people to just \"work harder\" because of the fluctuating job market. While I don't think its right for your mother to restrict how you make money because of her own insecurities, getting a job even at a McDonald's isn't as easy as just going into a store and saying you want to work there. You're 18 and an adult, and she should let you be an adult.  \n\n\nA quick piece of advice for the next expensive thing you get your hands on: if you're going to make your money online again through working on your laptop, make sure you have some money stored away in the case you laptop becomes damaged or you need to buy replacement parts. Also, look into insuring your next big purchase.", "NTA I agree with this comment. I don\u2019t understand why OP is being advised to apologize to his mother. She doesn\u2019t discipline her 9yo for breaking the laptop. She doesn\u2019t want OP to baby sit or car wash because it will hurt \u201cher image\u201d and is controlling how long he can stay out of the house. Hence his only income was working online where she doesn\u2019t care to control. Ko-fi is legal way for OP to raise money to buy a new computer. She is extremely disrespectful and frankly abusive in the manner that she berates OP. I don\u2019t think it is easy for a 18 yo with immigration issues to get a job outside when he is living with a parent like this. She is constantly berating him for using Ko-fi. Imagine what she will do if he gets a job outside.", "I posted an update on my profile explaining my job situation and such that even made me think about crowdfunding in the first place. I will apologize to her though because I acknowledge my words were hurtful", "I put an in depth explanation of all this on my profile if you care to read more. Just to give a bit more insight to the situation", "read the update on my profile for more insight into the situation", "Not what I said, and commented before the update. And I said that cause I assumed that they are a struggling family and even if the 9-year-old broke it, if you have to choose between replacing the laptop or paying a house bill, and I assumed that they still lived in the house, the bill will be chosen. I wasn't mean in my comment or advice. It's just the reality of some situations. A 9-year-old broke something and I assumed they were punished, but how can a 9-year-old pay for it to be replaced if an 18-year-old cant? Yes if the family was in better situations id say replace it, but they aren't. I didn't agree the mom was right, I pointed out that telling someone to work harder isn't the answer. If it was then op should have taken their advice and worked harder but that's not the answer. I suggested a cheap one or going to a trade program that offers things like that. Not something means, just a suggestion. Something more than just sucking it up. Don't let this hurt your feelings. There were far harsher responses.", "What a warped perspective you have to think that they didn't own the laptop just because it might have been a gift...\n\nNTA", "I won't.  Someone can do it, and I'll think its tacky as fuck.  I won't budge. \n\nJust like if you decide to pan handle for a PS5 or something, I'd find it tacky", "OP isn't an artist asking their followers for tips.  He is a teen who wants people to purchase stuff for him", "I'm a millennial. I've worked since I was a kid, I picked berries, junte bote y cart\u00f3n, took care of chamacos, worked 2 jobs in college, the list goes on. Everyone I went to college with, had a very similar upbringing y eran bien trabajadores desde ni\u00f1os. This is the first time I'm hearing an immigrant parent not teaching their kid basic life skills, like driving and getting a job. \n\nThe co-depedency your mom has enforced in y'all's life and relationship is unhealthy and toxic AF. It sounds like she didn't give you an alternative to earning money but now that you're 18, it doesn't mean you should stay in that rut. \n\nHave a good conversation with your mom, apologize for what you said and tell her your relationship with her has to change now that you're an adult. Young women like you, often marry the first loser they meet so they can leave home and that's not a good alternative either.", "All right I'm gonna get downvoted for this, but it just kills me that your mom is here illegally and what she's worried about is that people are going to judge her for what you're doing online? THAT'S what she thinks people will judge her for???? \n\nWell, she dug this hole now she has to help you figure your way out of it! She needs to help you get your paperwork in order! From what I found online you have to apply for naturalization and jump through all the hoops, but it is possible to do. You need to get things moving though so you can get your life plan together... decide on school or some type of job.", "Simple, your mom lost control, and you instead of turning around and let her cool down, you insulted her. Apologize for the insult, not for you trying to get ahead. Maybe she will apologize because she lost it to, most likely not, but at least you will be at peace and she will see that you are growing up. It's not about being right, it's about being an adult about it.", "I hope it all works out for you and you get your laptop.", "Not every parent can afford to replace expensive items on a whim. OP only got the laptop in the first place not from his own money, and not because his parents could afford it with their jobs, but because of a fluke one-time insurance pay out to his father in law after a car wreck. If the mom could afford to replace the laptop but refused, that is different... if OP bought the laptop with his own money, that's also a little different. But that's not what happened. The laptop was given to him as a gift, and mom is struggling financially so much she can't even afford to buy christmas presents, so wtf do you want her to do? Accidents happen.", "OP says they\u2019re not allowed to", "I'm in the world of this comment section that heavily leans YTA", "Does that waive the filing fee? If someone can't afford a laptop they likely can't afford the cost of filing. It's also far from a quick process", "Sure, and there are valid reasons to say that, however the idea that someone does not fully own something gifted to them is the dumbest thing I've heard all week.", "I'm being judgmental on a sub whose entire existence is based on making judgements about others behavior.  Yet I'm an asshole for it?  \n\nIf you are calling me judgmental, isn't that judgmental of you as well?", "Unfortunately, no. The filing fee for an I-485 is never waiverable, excepting in the case of victims of trafficking (I think \u2014 IANAL).\n\nAnd while without necessarily diminishing the absolute financial hurdle that is getting documented status (USD $1,225 is a lot of money for most people), upon filing Form I-485 you can simultaneously file Form I-765 and Form I-131 without any additional fees. Turnaround decision on the EAD (I-765) is pretty quick \u2014 generally 90 days plus mail delay following USCIS' receipt of the form. And at that point, OP can legally work / apply for a SSN, etc.\n\nAnd if someone was able to Ko-Fi for a laptop, I imagine they could also Ko-Fi for these funds as well.", "Why would a car lot be calling an attorney?", "That's all valid points, though I think some of the timeliness depend on locality. I know for my wife's green card it ended up costing around 3k(uscis also had some additional requirements and fees, and doctors where we were living were expensive...)\n\n\nAnyways, the timeliness can absolutely be fucked. We have a friend who has been waiting two years for action, and to remove my wife's conditional status we were told she'd likely be eligible for citizenship well before she was processed. \n\n\nWhat I'm saying is that the US immigration system isn't exactly a friendly customer experience.", "The client calls from there, thinking their lawyer will be excited with them that they just bought a $100,000 car the day after getting a $600,000 settlement. They know from experience, that usually means it\u2019s about to all be gone.", "Oh Gotchya. I guess it didn\u2019t really occur to me to keep in contact with your lawyer after a case is settled lol."]}
