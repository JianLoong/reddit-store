I hope you\u2019ve been getting help for your PPD and are making him aware what he\u2019s doing to you now! \n\nIf you can earn more than him and you need the money, it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for you to take over as the primary breadwinner and for him to take over as the primary parent. \n\nI\u2019m really worried about you, though. He was already making you feel you weren\u2019t enough when you were doing most of the parenting, and now that you\u2019re working and earning more than him, he\u2019s still giving you a hard time because honestly he can\u2019t be bothered to be the parent he expects you to be. Your partner isn\u2019t supposed to make your life harder than it already is.", "That's parenting. That's life. - NTA \n\nAnd let's not pretend the expectation on you isn't sexist and obnoxious; no one would bat an eye if the roles were reversed.", "NTA\n\nHe sounds immature, sadly. I think you need to have a sit down and divide the work based on both your schedules and try to get to a compromise. Good luck", "NTA. He doesn't want to do what he expected you to do in the past.", "NTA, he\u2019s a parent, welcome to reality. Shielding him from the absolute life changing element of having a tiny human to care for is not your responsibility.\n\nHe can be useful, or trust me, that love you feel? It will die a slow painful death. Do not martyr yourself, he steps up, or he steps out.", "NTA, you are BOTH parents. You need to be partners in this and he should be able to carry the weight when you are working to contribute to your shared income. \n\nAs this is a serious position and you say that he also pushed you into getting this job, I sugged sitting down with him and planning out your week plan ahead. Mark out the time when he is working, when you are working and then it is a bit more obvious who can take care of your son when. Split the house chores too or plan them ahead. And finally, talk with him DIRECTLY about how his comments are making you feel and ask him to check his behavior or think about you when he is making these comments.", "NTA, if you were a man, no one would claim you're forgetting your child because of work. The double standard isn't fair. But why is your husband pushing for this job at the same time he's shaming you?", "Sometimes the person we want to be is not who we are. Maybe he is more his father than he likes to admit. NTA", "This is one MEGA NTA.  I wish i could do it in all caps but that would make it sound angry. It's not. I will not judge the behaviour of your fiancee. Like you said good outweighs the bad, sounds like the average relationship. no one is perfect right? \n\nAbout the rest, it's just economical. You make more money, he should be transitioning in at least a more involving role. Some things dads cant replace what a mom does. But most of the things can still be done. So i completely agree with you there. If you're still there for your child in between your working than you are an awesome parent and your fiancee should concentrate on the good part.", "NTA. What\u2019s the \u201cgood\u201d?\n\nHe pushes you into a job with crazy hours, and punishes you when you need to work them.\n\nHe criticizes you as a mother, even when you\u2019re in recovery.\n\nYou know he\u2019s deliberately cruel to you (\u201cpetty\u201d).\n\nHe\u2019s weaponizing your mental illness\u2014PPD\u2014to humiliate and shame you and gain your compliance. \n\nHe resents caring for his own child.\n\nSo: you make more money, do more childcare, and he berates you. What else does he do?", "NTA. I don't blame you for taking a job that makes good money in an effort to support your family, but that doesn't mean there should be a \"primary parent\". You should make sure that you are finding adequate time to spend with your child, esp. in his formative years. But what is your husband doing to earn money? Why is that responsibility solely on you? It is completely unfair of your husband to suggest that you're not doing enough around the house or with your son while also pushing you to find a better-paying job. \n\nThere is no primary parent. There are two parents here and both need to be equally involved in earning money, raising your son, and taking care of your home. Call your husband out on this. If need be, get couples counseling. If he won't go they get counseling for yourself because you shouldn't be shouldering all of this alone while also dealing with PPD. But don't beat yourself up for not doing enough when it sounds like your husband isn't making nearly enough effort himself.", "NTA. \n\n Weaponizing confidence that's what he's doing..he is a parent...  Or supposed to be...he doesn't get to spend all his free time and not taking care of his kid as well", "I'm going with ESH. \n\nYou for 'telling' him it's his turn - everything like this should be a joint decision.\n\nHim for giving you a hard time about work.\n\nY'all need to get on the same page.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I assume his expectations from you and himself are quite different when it comes to childcare. It is unfortunate that a lot of woman are expected to work, be primary caregivers of  children and manage the house culturally, and it seems like your fiance is in that camp. It makes sense that he is resistant to change, as the current situation favors him a lot. \n\nDo not feel guilty for having a life outside being a mother, you should not have to give up your life for others and that is not an example you want to set for your child. Do not settle for something you would not want your child to settle for. \n\nAlso, I would advise you to not get married till you get on the same page on your responsibilities.", "ESH", "Absolutely positively NTA. He helped create this child, she should at least be doing 50% of the parenting, childcare, household chores etc. what did he expect when he pushed you into taking this job??

Like WTF??", "I doubt he would be pleased if you asked him would he prefer you quit your job so you can spend more time being a primary parent as that sounds like the only option. Truth be, both of you are primary parents, and each pitches in to see that each does what has to be done. If it means he has more child responsibilities then so be it. Don\u2019t moan and complain about it as that what I hear from him with your description. It\u2019s about him wanting more of his ME time than you being home with the child. What about your ME time?

Thank you for your concern, I appreciate it.", "His father is one of the most sexist, controlling and financially abusive men ive met in my entire life so he comes from a family background where the mom has more expectations of her for family roles. He is aware that it's wrong but I do think it's seeped it's way into his line of thinking without him knowing unfortanetly. We are trying to break the cycle with him and his brother, for the most part things are going OK until this so we will see how it turns out. Thank you!", "Thank you, ive tried that before but he doesn't follow it and claims he can't remember what his responsibilities are, even when I write them down he claims forgetfulness.", "The sad thing is, ive tried all these things. I'm a planner, I make sure everything is planned out weekly and meticulously. I am trying very hard to be present and help. I wake up early everyday to help get him ready for daycare, every second I am home is spent cleaning and caring for our son. I honestly don't know why he thinks I'm ignoring my responsibilities as a parent now that I'm working.

When we met I was a drug addict and he helped get me set up and jn a better place, he's been supportive of every move I've made. This is the first real issue that's popped up jn a our relationship in years, I beleive that's he's having a hard time transitioning and that stress from it is comming out in a bad a regretful way. I'm not the only one that needs my emotions acknowledged. I'm taking the advice and getting us some counseling to work through this, as I beleive he's just struggling and letting it come out in a bad way.

I think I am going to suggest couples counseling like yoy suggested, we have some other issues on top of this I think it could be helpful with. When I say primary parent I mostly mean the one who is more present with meals and bathing, since I'm not home for some of those things. While I do get up everyday and get him ready for daycare I'm not home three evening and most of the day on weekends so I just told him he needed to be the responsible parent for those times but he's acting like im never home and never do anything to help now.

So plan -with- him, not -for- him. He should be part of that process or it is just dropped on him and he doesn't know all the things you are doing in the background to make something happen. For real, you can even offer to switch roles for few weeks so he is the one waking up early to get the child ready for daycare, doing the cleaning and so on.", "Sounds like he's lost in bad habits and unable to step up", "I'm glad you understand it because I sure don't. He's pushing you to do something that's beneficial to your whole family while he's shaming you for that decision at the same time. That's mentally abusive.

But then he can't follow through with what I've decided. Honestly I did just drop on him that he needed to step up and do more now that I'm working, and seeing some of the replys I'm starting to think that maybe I went about it the wrong way. I still think that he should do more but maybe I should've been gentler with and more gradual with his new responsibilities.", "Yes, someone else also suggested counseling.

He doesn't get to opt out of this.

I just find it outrageous that he pushes and encourages you to get a better job while simultaneously shaming you for it. Like what the hell is wrong with him.

I appreciate your advice, let's just hope he doesn't put up a huge fight about it", "Op, it is your relationship, but you must understand - if you don't push things towards balance early on, your partner will never expect it in future. The status quo will be with burden heavily on your shoulders and he won't even realize it. This will breed resentment in you if not worse feelings overtime. It is best for your relationship health to have things discussed, transparent and have a line to communicate about this - make it NORMAL to communicate about it, to exchange roles when one needs help and so on.", "I can't agree with this more. My husband came from a family where the sexism wasn't aggressive, just sort of built in. Fortunately, when things were pointed out to him by me he stepped up, but there were quite a few arguments before he started doing things by himself. Get in and nip this in the bud early otherwise this is your life. Do you want to still be earning more and doing all the planning and housework until the day you drop? Imagine 50 years of this, and how brow beaten you will be. The love will wither and die easily if things don't change.", "We are working on things, when he gets home today we are going to have a discussion about how we are both feeling and what we can do to work on our relationship.
