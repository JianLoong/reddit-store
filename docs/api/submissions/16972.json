I have to work every weekend and a few evening a week.\n\n I've felt horrible about being away from my family but he is the one that's pushed me into getting a job like this. He keeps making comments about me forgetting I have a child and not having time for my son(1m) anymore. My son is my entire world and I had horrible post partum depression that I thought had gotten better but with every comment from him I can feel myself spiraling back into those feelings. My fiance can be very petty and always made me feel like I wasn't doing enough while on maternity leave when I would ask him to do some cleaning to help or feed our son. \n\nI just need to know if I'm in the wrong for expecting him to take on more of a parenting role now that I'm back to work or if i should still try to do most of it myself? I will not leave him  as I love him so much and the good defiently outweighs the bad with him however I've been told by my family that I should still find a way to be the primary parent and that I should leave my job and find something with better hours.\n\n But we really need the money, having a kid completely decimated our savings and we had to move after having our son to a more expensive apartment. Thank you in advance for any replies!\n\nEDIT: so i took some of the advice and had a conversation with him when he came home. We are going to look into couples counseling, and personal. He didn't think what he was doing was that bad and affecting me the way it was, but now he sees that what he was doing was wrong and starting to mirror his father. He doesn't want to be like him, regardless of what some of you may think. He is a great dad, and a great partner, unfortanetly we had a bad couple of years here but we want to work it out as we do love each other and our son. He is happy for my job and how it makes me happy, he was just feeling down about me not being around as much and it came out in a very negative way. He's willing to try whatever I think we need to feel better on both ends. Surprisingly he was more responsive to making a chore chart than he has been in the past so we will see how that goes. Thank you for the concern and the advice from the people that actually wanted to help, I appreciate it alot.\n\nI definetly learned that I have to have more of a gentle approach rather than telling him how it is, as much as I'm a sensitive person...so is he.

I hope you\u2019ve been getting help for your PPD and are making him aware what he\u2019s doing to you now! \n\nIf you can earn more than him and you need the money, it\u2019s perfectly reasonable for you to take over as the primary breadwinner and for him to take over as the primary parent. \n\nI\u2019m really worried about you, though. He was already making you feel you weren\u2019t enough when you were doing most of the parenting, and now that you\u2019re working and earning more than him, he\u2019s still giving you a hard time because honestly he can\u2019t be bothered to be the parent he expects you to be. Your partner isn\u2019t supposed to make your life harder than it already is.", "That's parenting. That's life. - NTA \n\nAnd let's not pretend the expectation on you isn't sexist and obnoxious; no one would bat an eye if the roles were reversed.", "NTA\n\nHe sounds immature, sadly. I think you need to have a sit down and divide the work based on both your schedules and try to get to a compromise. Good luck", "NTA. He doesn't want to do what he expected you to do in the past.", "NTA, he\u2019s a parent, welcome to reality. Shielding him from the absolute life changing element of having a tiny human to care for is not your responsibility.\n\nHe can be useful, or trust me, that love you feel? It will die a slow painful death. Do not martyr yourself, he steps up, or he steps out.", "NTA, you are BOTH parents. You need to be partners in this and he should be able to carry the weight when you are working to contribute to your shared income. \n\nAs this is a serious position and you say that he also pushed you into getting this job, I sugged sitting down with him and planning out your week plan ahead. Mark out the time when he is working, when you are working and then it is a bit more obvious who can take care of your son when. Split the house chores too or plan them ahead.

I will not judge the behaviour of your fiancee. Like you said good outweighs the bad, sounds like the average relationship. no one is perfect right? \n\nAbout the rest, it's just economical. You make more money, he should be transitioning in at least a more involving role. Some things dads cant replace what a mom does. But most of the things can still be done. So i completely agree with you there. If you're still there for your child in between your working than you are an awesome parent and your fiancee should concentrate on the good part.", "NTA.

What else does he do?", "NTA. I don't blame you for taking a job that makes good money in an effort to support your family, but that doesn't mean there should be a \"primary parent\". You should make sure that you are finding adequate time to spend with your child, esp. in his formative years. But what is your husband doing to earn money? Why is that responsibility solely on you? It is completely unfair of your husband to suggest that you're not doing enough around the house or with your son while also pushing you to find a better-paying job. \n\nThere is no primary parent. There are two parents here and both need to be equally involved in earning money, raising your son, and taking care of your home. Call your husband out on this. If need be, get couples counseling. If he won't go they get counseling for yourself because you shouldn't be shouldering all of this alone while also dealing with PPD.

He's pissed that you're the \"woman\" and not taking care of the house/child but also wanting you to earn more for \"our\" future. He wants to have his cake and eat it too.", "You really should have figured this out before having a kid together.", "Oh. \n\nHe\u2019s been selfish, ungenerous, and inconsiderate for a year. Complains if asked to feed his own son. OP it\u2019s highly unlikely he is a good long term partner.", "Oh for crying out loud. You are not going to fix his immaturity by being gentle and trying to coax him out of it. He needs to grow the hell up and act like an adult, which means he takes on fully half the responsibilities of parenting your kid and running your household. That does not mean he \u201chelps\u201d you because it\u2019s not your sole responsibility. And of course he wants no part of it, it\u2019s way easier to act like a child and let you do everything. \n\nYou need to show some backbone here\u2014do you really want your child raised thinking this dynamic is normal? \n\nIf you want to try to make this relationship work (which honestly you should have a very long think about, because from what you written here he is failing as a partner, a parent, and an adult, and he is doing it on purpose), then get the Fair Play deck and follow the instructions with it for equitably divvying household and parenting responsibilities.", "Exactly. Seems like she can't do anything right which is typical abusive behaviour", "This clearly wasn't a problem before we had a kid together....", "Lol if your approach to a relationship is \u201cwe don\u2019t need to discuss anything until it actually happens\u201d you\u2019re going to have a real tough time. You should make sure you\u2019re on the same page about major life choices before committing to a partner, because now you\u2019re trapped with a child with a man who does not respect you or your career.", "You refuse to leave the person who is constantly making you feel like you don\u2019t do enough. What could POSSIBLY go wrong in this scenario? Don\u2019t listen to people who say burnout is real. You need to do all the housework, all the childcare, and make all the money. Don\u2019t complain or ask for help, because then you\u2019re a failure.\n\n\nSounds like SUCH a healthy relationship!/s", "So, your BF wants you to parent, work, and do housework, etc. what exactly is he bringing to this relationship except his contribution to the gene pool? NTA. No wonder you have PPD- you have no infant AND A TODDLER!  Dump the toddler, get some childcare ( whether professional, a friend, or family member), and live your best life without  the 25 yo toddler to take care of too.", "Nah, OP stated that she loves him too much to leave him. Even after what he\u2019s doing. I stopped reading and will not listen to her complain about her sexist husband. Her son is going to grow up with no respect for women either. Ironically, she thinks they\u2019re \u201cbreaking the cycle\u201d but she spelled \u201ccontinuing\u201d wrong.", "girl you're being abused. did he tell you he was trying not to be like his dad? because we've all heard that one.\n\nhis behavior is abusive to you and your kid. there isn't any *discussing* that, or *talking about it,* or whatever the twee fuck you're on about. he can stop being abusive or he can lose his wife and child. now set some boundaries, tell him it's time to act like a grownup man, and go be happy by yourself if he's not capable of being one.", "She's actually enabling more toxic environment for her son."]}
