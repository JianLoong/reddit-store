It very well could be related to mental health. She\u2019s not an asshole for googling, but she\u2019s an add joke for inserting herself into a conversation and not letting it drop.", "Yes the hospital is nearby where I live, about 45 minutes or so? But I haven\u2019t heard of it until now", "19 is old enough to know when to MYOB.\n\nOP, YTA.", "Thank you, this is what I needed to hear", "Exactly. Op doesn't think they're the asshole because the world revolves around them and they're the hero of the story.\n\nEven them posting this here affirms that in the sense that they need to share it. I'd put down money she's already gossiped it to half the class.", "How is this format done?", "Oh then it's really probably related to something personal to him that he is not yet ready to talk to others with, and this includes you. That's why he didn't want you to Google because it might force the convo towards him.\n\nNext time, remember this social cue, it's not that people treat you like a kid, it's because they dont want to talk about it further.", "Because you haven't needed their services???", "Who cares? They were having a private conversation clearly about medical issues and you crossed a boundary that they clearly set.", "Of course you\u2019d say this about one of the few comments defending you, and yet it still doesn\u2019t actually apply to your situation. \n\nYou weren\u2019t asking someone you were talking to to repeat themselves so you could continue a conversation, you were eavesdropping and butted in. They told you \u201cnevermind\u201d because they didn\u2019t want to share information with you. You are not the victim here.", "Your post makes it clear that you're smart enough to put two and two together...\n\nThat makes your persisting after learning it waa a hospital what so very insensitive and stupid.  You could and should have known better.", "Everyone else disagrees and knows YTA", "Including that it was weird and potentially AH of you to  bring it up with them once you knew it was a hospital?", "It's probably just a coincidence that you responded to the one person saying NTA and not the 40 calling you YTA, right?", "No. It is the exact opposite of what you need to hear. The world does not need people reinforcing terrible behavior. What you did is extraordinarily rude and intrusive. Massive YTA.", "Over 80 comments telling you you\u2019re wrong and you find one that\u2019s being downvoted to oblivion justifying your terrible social awareness and reply that it\u2019s what you needed to hear?\n\nYTA. \n\nGoogling was fine but could have waited until later. But the second you found out it\u2019s a hospital it\u2019s blatantly clear they\u2019re discussing something medical related and private. You chose to be all \u201cGotcha!\u201d at them like you triumphed over what you perceived to be gatekeeping when you\u2019ve chosen to eavesdrop on a private conversation you weren\u2019t part of and weren\u2019t wanted in.\n\nI doubt they will still be your \u201cfriends\u201d as you call them in the title when you\u2019re back tomorrow if you refuse to acknowledge your attitude problem and apologise for being so nosy."]}
