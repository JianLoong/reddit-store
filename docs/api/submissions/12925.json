We have always talked about having kids, and I\u2019ve always wanted to be there when they were born. When my dad was still alive, he used to tell me and my siblings all the time about how it literally brought him to tears (NOT a man who cries btw), and he would say he was so grateful for all of us and for the experience.\n\nMy beautiful and amazing wife is 8 months pregnant. It\u2019s been a pretty difficult pregnancy for her, well for us, but especially to her. She\u2019s had a few miscarriages in the past, and I\u2019ve just been praying to God for both of them to make it through safely.\n\nWe were talking more and more about what\u2019s going to happen when she goes into labor, and she\u2019s very adamant that I not be in the room, natural or C, no matter what. I\u2019ve tried convincing, pleading, begging, but she won\u2019t change her mind. Her mom is going to be with her, and I understand that she needs her mom, and that she needs to do whatever to make sure that everything goes smoothly. I don\u2019t wanna stress her out too much because I keep telling myself all that matters is that they\u2019re both healthy, but I\u2019m honestly really sad about not being able to be there for my son\u2019s birth.\n\nIt\u2019s not about me. I know that. All that matters is that they\u2019re both healthy. I\u2019ve been trying to come to terms and understand this on my own time, so as not to bother her, but Emily\u2019s just being so condescending to me, and I know that she\u2019s just stressed out and scared, so she doesn\u2019t mean it, but I feel like I deserve to process this at least for a few days. I still do everything as I\u2019ve done before, but she says that now I have this \u201cbeaten puppy dog\u201d look on my face, and its \u201cpissing her off.\u201d Then, she started scolding me asking me why it mattered so much to me, and if I was going to act this weak in front of our son. She told me I needed to just be a fucking man and \u201cget the fuck over it.\u201d I feel like crying, but I don\u2019t want her to know, and get mad at me again, so I told her I was going out to get groceries, and am writing this in the car to try and calm myself down. I love her so much, but what she said really hit me hard.

You said that it matters to you because you care about them and the moment, which is a valid reason.

Men are people and should show their emotions. That\u2019s she said you needed to be a man and not show emotions is toxic.

Being pregnant doesn't mean you have the right to be an asshole ( I have had 2 kids of my own). Have you been supportive throughout the pregnancy?

You're allowed to be sad. It sounds like you've accepted that you won't be in the room and you are processing it. She is being cruel with her reaction to that.", "NTA. \n\nWhile I understand and support that some women do not want the husband/significant other in the room for the birth of their child, \"just because\" is not justification enough. You're in a healthy marriage and both parties need to be able to communicate the reasonings behind their decisions. You're not just offering to be their out of a feeling of obligation, you want to be their to meet your child into the world, to be there from the first moments of their life outside the womb. You want to be there to support you and your son. Pretty understandable and sympathetic stuff. \n\nShe clearly has a reason for not wanting you there, it could be anything, but she needs to be able to tell you. She's afraid she'll poop herseslf? She doesn't want you to see the baby emerge and everything get stretched out? All natural processes, but her call. I'm sure there are dozens of possibilities.\n\nAddress it head on, something to the effect of: I'm sorry my beaten puppy dog look is pissing you off, but I'm legitimately upset, because you don't want me to witness the birth of my son. You haven't told me why you don't want me there to support you and our son when he's born.

Its \"pissing her off that youre disappointed? WELL OF COURSE YOUR DISAPPOINTED who doesnt wanna see their child coming into the world. the problem isnt that she refused to have you there but how angry she got that you were sad about it. Who tells your husband to 'man the fuck up' and not to be 'weak' in front of the baby? crying isnt a sign of weakness. It may just be her hormones acting like this or you are in for a hell of a ride op. best of luck", "Wow. NTA but your wife is. No reason to be strait up mean. Real men have emotions, they don\u2019t shove them down and leave holes in walls 10 years later over dishes not being done.", "NTA because you\u2019re respecting her wishes even though it upsets you, and she\u2019s belittling you for being upset. That is NOT COOL. It is NEVER COOL. Your partner should never, EVER say things like \u201care you going to be this weak in front of our child.\u201d Pregnancy is not a get out of jail free card for being straight up cruel. It\u2019s her body, her choice who gets to see it in that way, but it\u2019s also her choice to be an asshole, which she very much is right now.", "NTA i feel for you I really do but think this could continue afterwards.  You need to be careful here as I feel she is going to push you right out untill it gets convenient for her you take over. Her baby not our baby. All you can do is step back as the comments she made were vile pregnant or not an says she has zero respect for you. I know your heartbroken but maybe take her advice man up meaning step away and leave her to it no help nothing. I wish you all the luck I think your going to need it.", "NTA- She's literally only mad at you for having and displaying normal human emotions, which is messed up. Yeah, it isn't all about you, but it isn't all about her, either. It's the birth of your shared child and you have a right to be upset that she's denying you this experience. You can support her unequivocally and you still have the right to be disappointed and sad about this. And for the record, your son will be much better off with a male role model in his life who isn't afraid to openly show and talk about his emotions, and that is NOT considered a weakness. Would she prefer it didn't mater to you at all? The way I see it being this invested before your child is even BORN makes it seem like you're gonna be a great dad.", "NTA- I would ask her why. There are a lot of women who don\u2019t want to be seen when they are this vulnerable. They have heard stories of men who can\u2019t look at them the same way after they see the main event. And your assurance will help. But she may also be terrified and there is no moving her perspective. Women don\u2019t want to be seen grunting, screaming, and shitting themselves by the man they love. It may feel like it will just kill any possibility of you ever wanting her again while her body has already been hijacked and out of her control in many ways for the past 8 months. \n\nI\u2019m not a fan of her telling you to man up- if that is a pattern it is a huge red flag. If it is because she is really ready to give the baby an eviction notice and is a one off, I\u2019m inclined to ignore it.", "NTA and it's really not a debate. Only thing that could change this is if you're an actual AH to her during her pregnancy and a bad spouse/person.", "NTA. If she has an objection to you being there she could use her big girl words and explain herself instead of belittling you. Besides, it might be cultural but i find the idea of having people other than the parents (when there's two parents in a relationship obvs) at the birth utterly bizarre. \nI'm sorry your wife doesn't have any respect for you and i wish you well.", "NTA - WTF?!? Be a man?!? \n\nThis woman is downright narrow minded and needs a wake up call. She married you for you and supposedly loves you. But her actions are making her sound like the biggest AH! Who the heck talks to their future sons father like that?\n\nGo do your groceries, take a breather and come home. Then tell her she\u2019s not allowed to talk to you that way. Tell her that this has made you see her in a different light and not a good one. She needs to keep herself in check otherwise you walk.", "NTA\n  \nShe has the right to not have you be there. You have the right to be bummed about it and take time to process those emotions. It is not cool that she is telling you to get the fuck over it and 'be a man' \n  \nYes she is pregnant and stressed but still not an excuse to be rude and name call. On the brighter side of things think about all the verbal abuse you will NOT have to endure when she is in active labor.", "NTA- but I would rethink being with someone who treats you this way as it will only cause more problems further in the relationship", "I know she\u2019s stressed and hormonal, but that does NOT give her permission to talk to you like that.

I fear that your kid will grow up to be an asshole. I\u2019m sorry for you both. I hope the few weekends you get with him will be enough to teach him having and showing emotions is ok.\n\nAlso, not wanting the father to be at the birth of *his* child is unbelievable to me. It\u2019s your kid too!\n\nNTA, but she\u2019s showing you who she really is. Believe her.", "NTA\n\nYour whole last paragraph tells me everything I need to know.  Your wife sucks.  Being sad about not being there for the birth of your own child is a legit feeling.  Does she belittle you and your emotions regularly?", "All the Y.T.A. Comments disappoint  me. You're NTA for having emotions, which is the question here. She needs to accept he's upset he can't be there. He's TRYING to accept that he doesn't get to be there for the birth of his child and is being told to clam up his emotions and not bother her with them. Hormones or not that's not okay.", "I just hope your wife will let you do all the normal baby things, bathing, changing, holding and feeding if she's not breastfeeding.\n\nIt's worrying to me me that she told you to man up.\n\nWho the fuck says that.\n\nYes she's the one who birthing the baby but it's not just her baby it your as well.\n\nIs this normal for your wife to talk to you like this?\n\nIf not keep a look out for prenatal depression and postnatal depression.\n\nSorry forgot the NTA", "NTA you have feelings, its fucked up she is being abusive about it.", "NTA your 100 percent entitled to your feelings.

As long as your behavior is sincere and part of the way you\u2019re processing this, it\u2019s ok.

She is allowed to decide who sees and supports her during labor, you are allowed to be distressed at not being there.

What she said to you is horrible and abusive. It might be good to reflect on how many times she's let these beliefs slip.", "NTA, \n\nyour wife sounds emotionally manipulative or potentially abusive, her response to your acquiescence is to call you a beat puppy and a wimp. you sure she's a keeper if she doesn't let you feel anything at all ever?", "I'm horrified by your wife's reaction and behavior.

Her being adamant that only her mom being in the room makes me think she might be uncomfortable with you seeing her in a vulnerable state when giving birth.\n\nMaybe she's feeling insecure of you seeing her in birth mode, maybe she feels that she's protecting you in the case something goes wrong (God fobid). \nYou won't know until you talk to her.", "NTA\n\nThat's some pretty fucking vicious language for your wife to us against you.\n\nNo, you don't need to man up.

We have always talked about having kids, and I\u2019ve always wanted to be there when they were born. When my dad was still alive, he used to tell me and my siblings all the time about how it literally brought him to tears (NOT a man who cries btw), and he would say he was so grateful for all of us and for the experience.\n\nMy beautiful and amazing wife is 8 months pregnant. It\u2019s been a pretty difficult pregnancy for her, well for us, but especially to her.

I\u2019ve tried convincing, pleading, begging, but she won\u2019t change her mind. Her mom is going to be with her, and I understand that she needs her mom, and that she needs to do whatever to make sure that everything goes smoothly. I don\u2019t wanna stress her out too much because I keep telling myself all that matters is that they\u2019re both healthy, but I\u2019m honestly really sad about not being able to be there for my son\u2019s birth.\n\nIt\u2019s not about me. I know that. All that matters is that they\u2019re both healthy. I\u2019ve been trying to come to terms and understand this on my own time, so as not to bother her, but Emily\u2019s just being so condescending to me, and I know that she\u2019s just stressed out and scared, so she doesn\u2019t mean it, but I feel like I deserve to process this at least for a few days. I still do everything as I\u2019ve done before, but she says that now I have this \u201cbeaten puppy dog\u201d look on my face, and its \u201cpissing her off.\u201d Then, she started scolding me asking me why it mattered so much to me, and if I was going to act this weak in front of our son. She told me I needed to just be a fucking man and \u201cget the fuck over it.\u201d I feel like crying, but I don\u2019t want her to know, and get mad at me again, so I told her I was going out to get groceries, and am writing this in the car to try and calm myself down. I love her so much, but what she said really hit me hard. I just want them both to be healthy and safe, but I also wanted to be there.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Her belittling and cruel comments are totally uncalled for and makes her seem very unkind and insensitive and is the AH for that behaviour, especially to say stuff like man up and calling him weak. He's entitled to process that upset. I wonder if there's a fear of hers, like not wanting him to see her bits during labour for fear it puts him off sex after (which I know can be a worry of some women) but if that's the case, the solution would be to stay up the head end and not see her bits. Then both get to enjoy the whole process and still see baby lifted up etc without the gore. Or if she's scared of being vulnerable or if she's self conscious they could talk about ways to ease her fears.

You would have thought our kid just found the cure for cancer, but it was just kicking it's tiny 8 week feet. I never had a dad. So that was the first time I really got to see how a dad really feels about their child. And it was magical. So I understand your pain. Not first hand, of course. I think you absolutely have the right to be upset. \n\nThe issue here isn't that you're pressuring her to change her mind. The issue is she's mad that you're sad. It wounds like you voiced your opinion, which is fine. You're not yelling at her or pressuring her. You're just sad you're missing someone amazing and special to you. The way she's talking to you about the situation is absolutely disgusting. I think you're more of a man than the type of man she's describing/wants you to be.

My dad caught me by the ankle while the doctor was quick enough to get my sides.", "\"it's a little late for us to have that talk, ma'am.  That is called a baby.\"", "Not just resentment, but how you do you look at your marriage in the same way? Yes, childbirth is vulnerable, messy, painful, and scary.  But it\u2019s also the most amazing thing you\u2019ll experience.  Good, bad, or ugly, if you don\u2019t want your partner with you for that moment, what does that say about the marriage?  About the level of trust that exists?  Your partner is supposed to be your safe place.  How do you not take a step back and think that maybe this relationship isn\u2019t what you thought it was?\n\nSo much about long term relationships is trust.  How will he ever trust her in the future, knowing she doesn\u2019t feel like that about him?", "I mean, I am ALL FOR the woman's right to choose, and if she said no, she says no, i respect that. However, the hurtful shit she said was uncalled for and makes her T A here.  \n\n\nAlso I know that my hospital still only allows one person there", "\"wait for the doctor\"  \n\"TELL THAT TO MY SPAWN, I'M PITCHIN - GET READY TO CATCH!\"", "I think I'll be down voted to oblivion but I don't think it's the best representation of anyone's personality when they're 8 months pregnant, This is definitely sad for OP, but I wouldn't call wife an AH just yet. I think there's more going on (stress, fear) than we realize.", "I cannot even fathom a situation in which I *wouldn\u2019t* want my husband there over my mom. I\u2019ve had two kids, one C and one natural, my husband was there for both. I am incredibly close with my sister. She asked if she could be in the room when my first was born. I was only allowed to have one. Would I have been less self conscious with my sister in there? Idk, maybe, but it isn\u2019t just about me. It is as much his kid as mine and he has just as much of a right to be in there. \n\nIf I were OP, I would put my foot down and make it clear that I will be in the room. End of story. It\u2019s not like this is just a guy that knocked her up, this is *supposed* to be her partner. I don\u2019t know if I would ever be able to forgive my SO if they excluded me from the birth of my child if I were a man, but then again, the way she speaks to him about being a man is appalling and ugly. \n\nNTA.", "Right? Like when I was pregnant and thinking about who would be at birth because of COVID restrictions I was so torn between my mother and my husband because I feel like it was my husband's right to be there, but my god is he so terrible in emergency situations I felt like I needed my mom there in case something went wrong. \n\nLuckily (unluckily?) that pregnancy ended up being a miscarriage so I never had to make the decision.", "> Being present for the birth is an incredibly bonding experience - and will be forever one of my most cherished memories.\n\nI beg to differ here. My youngest was born at the height of the pandemic, unexpectedly (slightly premature), in the middle of the night. My wife was taken by ambulance while the older kids slept. There was a COVID curfew and I couldn't possibly be there for the birth. It has not affected my bonding at all compared to the older ones where I was present.", "A LOT of women are incredibly self-conscious giving birth for that exact reason. The whole \"it's gross, it's going to be bloody, shitty and other fluids...and it may forever distort how he looks at my body in a negative way\" etc. I get it.", "It really isnt that unusual. Some people arent great under pressure, some people dont like massive amounts of attention on them (theres already gonna be a plethora of doctors and nurses bearing down on you in most cases) as it stresses them out, and some people just dont want their spouses to see them in that state. Its not unusual, uncommon, or an AH move.\n\nNow her reaction to him being understandably sad about it, plus all the abuse rhetoric and toxic masculinity shes spewing *are* what makes her an extreme AH.", "Further how is she going to go raising a son if her idea of masculinity is that he hide away all emotions she sees as negative, including the good ones?", "This, definitely.\n\nTo me, there's an **enormous** difference between \"I asked her twice in the last month - begged and pleaded the second time - then today she said no and put her foot down on the subject and said all those horrible things\" and \"I've been doing everything in my power for the past 5+ months to manipulate my pregnant spouse into changing her mind, and today she finally started to call me on my emotional manipulation tactics and even started lashing out at me verbally!\" (And honestly, it's not a subtle difference.)\n\nBut from how the OP writes it, there really isn't anway to tell if he's closer to the former or the latter.", "Meeee. I would have loved for my ex husband to give a fuck about the birth of our kids. Of the pregnancy for that matter. I told him it was mandatory for him to be there for all of them.\nBaby #3 was a home birth. He played PlayStation in the other room till it was delivery time. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Born at 11pm then I was up the next morning getting the older kids ready and walked them to school while he slept in!!

It was a rough night for him \ud83d\ude12\nThank god I'm out of that emotionally abusive narcissistic relationship!", "My dad couldn\u2019t deal and was right outside the door as my aunt was with my mum in the delivery suite. My partner nursed me through a miscarriage and then was present for both our boys births, I wouldn\u2019t have had it any other way, he only requested we have my mum and auntie there as he\u2019s epileptic and if he had a seizure he would need someone to help him (my aunt) while my mum stayed with me. Two births and not a single hitch it was calm and he was amazing throughout my pregnancies and births and is a wonderful partner and dad to our now 5 & 5 yr old boys. I can understand wanting your mum there but not wanting your partner there I can\u2019t, he created this child why rob him of the experience of being there to see his child being born. My mum and auntie were both so happy to be asked to be present too.", "I am tending to agree that the wife needs some extra support medically at the moment.   It's possible that it's crunch time and her anxiety about going through birth is starting to come out in nasty ways. \n\nI know that the day I found out my coworker was found dead in his apartment that I acted weird. Focusing on the state of the dirt in my front yard after weed spraying and sweeping the dirt away to avoid harming my dogs.  Turns out I was having an anxious reaction to a brush with death. And that manifested in freaking out over dirt. \n\nOP, let your wife's medical team and mom know she's exhibiting some behaviors that isn't like herself and suggest extra support for pre-birth nerves.   The OBGYN can really put someone at ease about what to expect and how everything will be taken care of.", "That isn't what the post says. He says she was adamant that he not be there, and he begged and tried to convince her. There is no indication of timeline, or her being unsure initially when the begging happened. I don't see why he would be begging if she hadn't already said no.", "Yeah, in the short term the brain can really do weird stuff when stressed, that sort of thing can also trigger panic or anxiety disorders (any stressor can) and that's before we get into the pregnancy/brain/hormones interactions. \n\nMental disorders can get really scary and dangerous quickly, and pregnant people are at higher risk. It's important to seek help and/or say something. We have treatments.", "If he did I\u2019d bet she\u2019d complain ..", "Well, it has caused you to shut down your feelings for over 20 years. That sounds pretty bad, and her making fun of you must have affected you deeply.", "This is how my husband feels. He had to hold up one of my legs too cause I was so tired. 12 hours and no sleep does that to you lol. But he didn\u2019t see me any differently than before. In fact I feel like he loves having sex more than before tbh. He was just cheering me on saying I can do this and he was happy to be there for me and our baby.", "The nurses were telling me to encourage my wife and cheer her on, so I did...until she screamed at me \"shut the fuck up, I know I can do it!\". We laugh about it now lol"]}
