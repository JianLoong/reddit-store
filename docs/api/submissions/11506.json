Everything going on right now\u2014his seeming unease\u2014is just him grappling with experiencing a level of familial intimacy foreign to his own experience and upbringing. It feels weird to him, but he recognizes that it\u2019s his problem to deal with, not yours. Neither of you have done anything wrong here.", "NAH\n\nSounds like he's just not used to platonic/familial PDAs, so he's getting squicked out by an incestous vibe he's imagining. People who grow up in an environment where that kind of display is reserved for romantic partners tend not to innately understand that it's not universally so. He probably just needs time to adjust.", "NAH you\u2019re not weird and he\u2019s entitled to his feelings. His feelings are definitely something he should explore, and maybe he should think about therapy, to work through why he is so uncomfortable watching siblings be physically affectionate.", "NAH\n\nSome people just aren't comfortable with showing affection like that with family. Quite honestly, my family was like his until my mom got very sick and we all realized that we should be expressing our feelings better and more often. Now, I don't leave without telling them I love them. He wasn't rude and he wasn't angry.... You're good and he's good too. Perhaps it's just something you two need to talk more about. Maybe you can somehow explain your family's logic to him and he'll get it.", "NTA, but y\u2019all may need to see a therapist together because he seems to have the ick.\n\nDifferent families have different comfort levels with physical affection. And some people have, say, watched too much media.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Either he is sexualizing your relationship with your sister, or he is uncomfortable being around people expressing affection differently than the way he does. Neither is acceptable.", "NTA-It's not weird she's your sister and that's how you were raised. I used to think stuff like that was weird but then I became friends with some really affectionate ppl and realized my family just doesn't value physical touch. I also don't know where you're from but in US and other \"Western\" cultures I feel like there is a cultural aversion to overt physical affection outside intimate partners. Not that you're doing anything wrong this def a him problem and not a you problem. You're not making out with each other so he needs to chill.", "Nta think carefully whether marrying this guy is a good idea. He will be cold to his kids, is that what you want?", "NTA.  As you say, you\u2019re more physically demonstrative than most families.", "NTA. Your fiance has some intimacy issues he should probably seek help for.", "NTA. You didn't do anything inappropriate or worrisome- he's just not used to it and clearly that's making him uncomfortable. It would be worth it to further discuss this with him to see where his head is at, if he is genuinely concerned you have some kind of \"unsavory\" thing going on with your sister, or what.\n\nI have a very affectionate family and have experienced similar responses from people. Many of my family members kiss hello/goodbye on the lips (I stopped doing it in HS because of the judgement), which isn't the norm here, and the looks on people's faces sometimes, I swear.", "NTA\n\nI think it\u2019s perfectly ok for siblings to enjoy each other\u2019s company and as long as the affection isn\u2019t crossing any romantic boundaries then there\u2019s nothing wrong with it\n\nAre you sure you want to marry a guy who gets jealous over your sister?", "NAH, but is he cuddly with you? I'm not a fan of the uncuddly", "INFO: do you think he felt a little third-wheely? I come from a big family and it takes a very conscious effort to make sure my partner is still included when we're all hanging out. It's easy to focus in on the people you know the best. My best guess is he probably felt left out and maybe you two weren't inclusive as you should be, especially if you hadn't seen each other in a while.", "I've never had a sibling that I've been close to, as I am adopted and my brother lives with another family in a completely different country, so I cannot really give proper input on this. But I will say that I think that It's something you should talk to him about. In short, you're NTA. Every family grows up differently and some families are closer to each other than others are. Women, in general, also tend to be more physically affectionate with one another. So that as well is also a factor in this. I think you need to just talk to him and explain and tell him to respect the fact that you're just really close and comfortable with your sister and that nothing weird is going on between y'all.", "NTA\n\nIf he's coming from the stance, that he doesn't get it because his family isn't like that and it's foreign to him. Cool. Y'all can work on that.\n\nIf he coming from the stance that he's sexualizing it, dump him cause that's fuckin gross.", "NTA. He's probably jealous that you are doing all that with your sister and not him. Either that or he's not that intimate and thinks that you shouldn't be either. Either way, he has some things he needs to work out if he wants to be with you. If it's the later then he sounds pretty controlling and is going to be a difficult partner. If it's the former then he just has to get over himself and there is more hope.", "NTA.   \nSince you can\u2019t expect much \u201ctouchy feely\u201d interactions with your fianc\u00e9, you might as well continue with someone who appreciates it.", "You're not weird. She's your twin, you shared a womb...holding hands and hugging after you haven't seen her for a while isn't overstepping. You don't even live in the same state so it's obvious you're not attached to the hip. He's the odd one. NTA", "NTA - some families are just more affectionate than others. My dad\u2019s side are all kissers and have been my whole 30+ years of life. We all (aunts/uncles/cousins/ siblings etc.) do super quick pecks on the cheek or lips whenever we greet or say goodbye. My husband thinks it weird (his family barely likes to make eye contact with each other), but other than random comment here and there- he\u2019s pretty immune to it. As long as no one is forcing your fianc\u00e9 to be affectionate , I don\u2019t see the issue. It\u2019s not sexual, so it\u2019s weird if he\u2019s sexualizing if and he should probably work on that.", "NTA. You literally shared a womb with her.

There are some of us that, like you fiance, did not grow up in super affectionate families that hugged, but then realized later  on in life that we really wanted more of that because we are the most affectionate/empathetic out of the bunch.\n\nI would bet on the fact that it is not anger, but dissapointment, that is causing his actions, and not dissappointment directed at you, but rather at his childhood and a lack of that affection that you got to experience, which also made him jealous.\n\nI don't know how affectionate you already are with him, and frankly it's none of my business. But...if you've ever felt that...maybe...you are toning your affection down because you worry that it would make it him uncomfortable due to his upbringing, then maybe just try....not doing that.\n\nIf it works and his actions stop, then you'll have your answer. If not, then go from there.", "NTA\n\nYou realize he\u2019s sexualizing the platonic physical affection you share with your sister?

Sorry but he should make you feel uncomfortable about that", "NTA: And he isn't as long as he doesn't force the issue bc it's a him issue, you did nothing wrong. He needs to explore WHY seeing you be physical affection with family is making him so freaked out then he needs therapy.", "NTA.  My family is the same way.   We will hug each other, hold hands, cuddle up on the couch for movie night, and we are all well into our 50s.  Let's not even get into how we behave if we haven't seen each other in a while, lol.  Some families have different levels of comfort with physical touch.   But if I were you, I would be wondering how your future children are going to be treated.", "INFO: Have you discussed how you're going to raise any potential children?", "A women, says so in my post.", ">I (29f)", "Yeah, I wonder if he's struggling with a twins fantasy thing ....", "I don't know that this is necessarily true. My mother's family is very physically affectionate, whereas my dad's isn't at all. They are both from the same non-Western hometown and have four siblings each. My dad wasn't physically affectionate at all with me growing up (scared to even hold me as a baby) but I never doubted for a second how much he loved and cared about me. His warmth just came through in different ways, like the way he spoke or his facial expressions. I'm a married adult living away from home, and even now he's the most awkward hugger ever, but he totally can't hide how excited he is to see and spend time with me and my family when we get together. I ended up somewhere between my mom and dad; I'm not at all uncomfortable with physical touch, but I'm not likely to be the one to initiate it.\n\nI think NAH, as long as no one is outright condemning the other person's level of comfort with familial physical affection. It may just take some getting used to for both individuals, and doesn't necessarily bode poorly for future children in terms of feeling loved or cared for.", "While I will always suggest careful consideration, it doesn't automatically follow he will be cold.\n\nI come from a very New England background, not a lot of touchy-feely stuff. My husband is from a Latin background, so the complete opposite. While I wasn't raised that way, it turns out that I really appreciate a more physically affectionate family dynamic. I'm agreeing that the fianc\u00e9 is just a fish out of water and needs to get used to what physical affection can look like in a normal sisterly relationship. I'm guessing he enjoys the affection he receives from OP, and as his future wife, she'll be setting the tone with their children.", "Eh thats not true.

That\u2019s not a sign that OPs partner needs to seek help.", "NAH - honestly the vibe I\u2019m getting here is that you and your boyfriend live together and you have introduced a third party temporarily staying with you. Of course this will change the dynamics. It doesn\u2019t have to be in a romantic way. If a best friend stayed with you and took up a lot of your time, intimate time such as hugging, movie watching holding hands, I think it is more than fair for the boyfriend to feel out of sorts. \n\nHe has raised it in a fair way.
