{"id": 25036, "submission_id": "15vlbg3", "title": "AITA for making my landlady wait 29 minutes before she showed my apartment to a potential tenant?", "selftext": "Long story short, I\u2019m moving at the end of the month and am in the process of packing my stuff up. My landlady keeps on showing my apartment to potential tenants at least three times per week, which really annoys the hell out of me since I\u2019ve paid August\u2019s rent to live here, so I should be able to enjoy my apartment in peace. I don\u2019t like getting kicked out of my apartment (oftentimes when doing school-related things), so that the apartment can be shown. I asked her to limit the amount of showings, since the showings were becoming bothersome to me. She responded by telling me she has \u201cevery right\u201d to tour my apartment, since I handed in my 30-day notice to vacate at the beginning of August.\n\nLocal laws are such that if a landlord/landlady is going to show a rental property with somebody still living there, the landlord/landlady must give a 24-hour notice to the tenant. Most of the time, my landlady gives me almost exactly a 24-hour notice. Like, I\u2019ll get a text at 2:59 pm saying that there\u2019s going to be a showing at 3:00 pm the next day. She never gives me more than a 25-hour notice, which seems purposeful on her end.\n\nWell, on Thursday afternoon, I got a text at 4:29 pm saying that there will be a tour at 4:00 pm on Friday. When my landlady showed up and knocked on my door at exactly 4:00 pm, I opened the door and told her that she needs to wait 29 minutes. She immediately got all pissy with me and demanded an explanation. I showed her my phone which proved that she sent her message at 4:29 pm the previous day, so she legally couldn\u2019t step foot into my apartment until 4:29 pm. She started yelling at me saying that I\u2019m just being petty. The potential tenant who was going to tour my place wasn\u2019t willing to wait 29 minutes, so he cancelled the showing and bounced. \n\nMy landlady was very upset and said that I \u201cwasted her time.\u201d I know what I did was out of pettiness, but if she didn\u2019t kick me out of my own apartment like twelve times in August so far, I wouldn\u2019t have a reason to be petty.

Your landlady is being overly intrusive. Even if the laws are on her side to allow her to show the place she's still being utterly inconsiderate. This is still your *home* and you are legally entitled to some right to privacy \n\nIANAL but I would dive deeper into your local tenancy laws. Some places allow you to refuse entry, even with notice, for certain reasons. Some do not consider a text message to even be legal notice. Some limit the time and manner in which your home may be entered. Also, there's a good chance that your landlord cannot legally force you to leave for these showings.\n\nSince you're leaving soon it might not be worth fighting her but you can do other petty things as well. Leave your place a mess (nothing that can't ultimately be cleaned so you don't risk your deposit) so it looks less appealing. Talk to prospective tenants and make it sound like the place is terrible.", "NTA. I've never had a landlord start showing my apartment while I still occupied it ever but this definitely seems excessive.

Just refuse all viewings at this point. There\u2019s nothing your landlord can do about it. It\u2019s a civil matter that would take far longer than the 10 days left on the month to deal with.", "NTA \n\nWho says you have to leave? No way in fucking HELL! She can take pictures and show pictures and say \u201csorry there is a tenant and I don\u2019t feel like disturbing their living quarters.\u201d \n\nFrom now on stay and make small talk. Then slip in a \u201cbet you can\u2019t wait to move in! Then when you move out you get to deal with people invading your home up to three times a day with only 24 hours notice and a landlady who\u2019s an asshole!\u201d \n\nThat should help!", "All these responders must be landlords- yeesh. Shoving your head up your landlord\u2019s ass doesn\u2019t help you at all in anyway. The landlord was outside of the legal boundary, the tenant held them to it. NTA at all and I bet it felt great to throw it back at them.", "NTA\n\nWhere you petty? For sure. But so was your landlady with always texting you almost exactly 24h beforehand. \n\nAlso why are you being kicked out of your apartment during this showings? It should be up to you if you want to leave or stay. I have been to several showings where the tenants stayed during the showing.", "Hahahaha NTA\n\nGood riddance to this landlord.", "NTA, Well done! What goes around, comes around.", "ESH. I don\u2019t blame you for exercising your right, but you were an arsehole.\nWhat did you actually gain by doing that? \nLosing a potential tenant just means more open homes for you to deal with.\nDid the petty spite make you feel good?\nI\u2019m guessing not if you are posting here.\nDid you try just asking her for more notice?", "ESH. I completely understand your frustration, but as a renter, this is something you'll have to deal with. Yes, you paid your rent, but you're living on their property. It sucks, but they have as much of a right to the space as you do.\n\nI'm assuming your lease details your landlord's right to show your home with provided notice. While you were right that she was not abiding by those rules, there was really no reason to make her wait other than being spiteful. Not only did you piss off your landlord, but you also potentially lost them a new tenant. If you continue to rent, hopefully your next landlord won't call for a reference.\n\nEDIT: changed judgment", "YTA. You were being petty, grow up - having prospective tenants visit the apartment while you're in the process of moving out is just part of renting. It's not your property, it's part of the rental agreement that she has the right to show the apartment to other people when you're preparing to leave.", "YTA\n\nHaving her show the apartment is annoying but it is part of life and she is giving you the required notice. And the poor prospective tenant got their time wasted for no reason at all so you didn\u2019t just stick it to the landlord, you also messed with an innocent person\u2019s day.", "YTA - yes, you were in the right, but it was petty and lame of you.", "Gosh I hope you don\u2019t need a rental reference anytime soon. YTA", "Yta, it's the landlords right to show the property and 3 times a week is absolutely nothing. My coworker is moving and their unit has had 5+ showings daily for 2 weeks. If you really think 3 showings A WEEK is excessive, you're just being petty and making other people's lives harder because you must think the universe revolves around you.", "ESH, but I don\u2019t blame you in the slightest. This is one of those, yeah you\u2019re being an asshole, but you\u2019re a justified asshole. She\u2019s being completely inconsiderate of your time and making it hard to live in peace with all these strangers coming through your home. I think turnabout is fair play sometimes.
