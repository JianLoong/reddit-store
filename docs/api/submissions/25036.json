I'd answer the door in my boxers then go back to bumping music on my TV while I lay spread eagle on the couch and belch and fart loudly. See how often she wants to be coming in at that point.", "I had a landlord do that when I lived in Boston. He never gave notice, which I now know is illegal, but didn\u2019t at the time.  We only found out that he was doing that because he showed up one day and my roommate\u2019s bedroom door was locked and he had to call her.", "We did a look through once, tennants still in bed, one walkong around in boxers, they refused to show certain rooms haha I respected it and noped out of there", "Oh yeah the spite law you just made up. The whole premise is the landlady didn\u2019t give proper legal notice and OP self-advocated by demanding the landlady follow the law.", "I wouldn't want to see the space full of other people's stuff. I'd want to see it empty and clean and fixed up.", "And the landlord needs to follow the law.  The OP has allowed it to be shown.  And asked for some consideration.  Like the LL could schedule showings once a week.  But no.  They wanted to be petty.  So the OP decided to reciprocate.  Holding the LL to the letter of the law.   \n    \nOh.   And the LL did not have proper notice for 4:29 either.  Since the notice wasn't legal.  No entry was legal at that time.  Responding to someone holding up the letter of the law.  With the same letter of the law.  Is not AH behavior.", "There's nothing really \"wrong\" with my place, per se. It's a relatively old building (built in like 1902 or something), so it doesn't have central A/C. I just happen to live in a city that doesn't have an insane renting market. The new apartment I'm moving into next week (located within the same city) was on the market for 6 weeks before I signed the lease. Most of the other places I toured were on the market for 3+ weeks too. I guess that's a benefit to living in one of the so-called \"flyover\" states: people aren't in a rush to move here.", "Thiiiiis is such a good idea!  It's easy for OP to clean up, doesn't take up a lot of space and sends a loud message.", "I did this. I put mouse traps under the kitchen and bathroom sinks and inside all the closets. All the places a landlord wouldn\u2019t notice, but where a potential renter wants to see.", "'Most of the time, my landlady gives me almost exactly a 24-hour notice.'  She gives the required legal notice so they are TA.", "I wonder if the guy didn't want to wait because he realized her behavior was a red flag!", "Just wondering, Which is the part OP is being \u201cthinks better than others\u201d? Also Are all other nurses have inferiority complex just like you? then You\u2019re just right fit in nurse, imho lol", "And what happened on the occasion that led to the confrontation that prompted the post?"]}
