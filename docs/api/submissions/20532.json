What's wrong with that woman. Chickens live for 10 to12 years when cared for. Why did this woman think they were just going to die, like an old party balloon? They are animals who need to be outside. Even if you have a garden, I don't think she realizes how loud 5 chickens are too.\n\n\nNTA and thank you for rehoming them.\n\n\nEdit: if you can re-home them at a farm, take your little one with you so they can see their new happy home. It will show them what the chicks need and how they are now happy.", "NTA\n\nYour reasons are logical. Besides, chicks are delicate pets and toddlers are impetuous and not aware of their strength: a bad combination, especially for chicks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She said I was being dramatic and they're just baby chicks so they're going to die in 2 weeks anyways.\n\nWhat... why? Were the chicks sick? Because, if properly cared for, they don't die in two weeks. And if there's something I don't know about chicks, why did MIL think it was a good idea to give your child a pet that dies after two weeks, when the child has already grown attached to them and therefore will get a shock from their deaths?", "NTA wow she sounds unhinged.", "Either your mother-in-law is genuinely not a smart person, or she knew that giving a toddler a bunch of delicate and vulnerable animals wasn't gonna fly, and make you look bad for saying no\n\nTell her to kick rocks\n\nNTA", "NTA you don't give a child a pet  \"that's going to die in 2 weeks\" that would be traumatic for the child! Anyone doing that I wouldn't leave them alone with my child. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou also don't give anyone a pet without knowing for certain that it's wanted. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChickens in a condo/apartment??? Your MIL needs mental help and also needs to learn boundaries.", "You\u2019re right to give them away - it\u2019ll be on you to take care of them and yes, chicks become chickens, and the thought of having five chickens in an apartment is madness. \n\nYour MIL didn\u2019t think that these are living beings; her attitude is something you\u2019ll have to put up with. \n\nI know that your son is sad now - but think of how traumatised he would have been if they did die. \n\nNTA and stick to your guns.", "NTA. Wtf who buys anyone (a child especially) a live organism with the intent that \u201coh it\u2019ll die in a few weeks anyway\u201d. My sea monkeys lived longer than that.

Vet all presents from her from now on.", "NTA. Who does that? I can only imagine the horror of a toddler trying to grip a chick and massively overdoing it.  You're right to give them away. Make sure it's *away* away and not back to her. If she assumes they'll die soon then she clearly has no idea how to care for them.", "NTA, she overstepped boundaries and had no right to decide your child needed baby chicks. Also\u2026they\u2019ll just die in 2 weeks? WTF? Can you imagine how sad your kid would be then?", "NTA\n\n- Gifting a responsibility like a pet is never great in like 99% of circumstances\n- If they don\u2019t die within two weeks you will have five fully grown ducks in your home, which is so much\n- If your MIL really wanted to do something nice, she could\u2019ve gotten fish. This seems like a weird control issue over their grandchild \n- Lastly, and maybe this is a stretch, I think your MIL wanted you to be the bad guy to your child", "NTA. It\u2019s crazy to offer pets out of the blue. It\u2019s crazier to gift chicks when you live in the city. It gets worse, it\u2019s not one but 5 and apparently she wants your toddler to learn at 3 how to deal with grief ??", "NTA \n\nYou clearly communicated your reasons for not wanting to get a pet for your toddler yet, and your mother-in-law disregarded your wishes by bringing the baby chicks. It's not fair for her to put you in a difficult situation and then dismiss your concerns about the well-being of the chicks.\n\nIt's important to prioritize the welfare of the animals and make decisions that are in their best interest. Standing your ground in this situation does not make you the bad guy; it shows that you are responsible and considerate of the animals' needs.", "Why did the chicken cross the road?\n\nTo get away from your mil.", "NTA. But please try to save those chicks from her. They need heat lamps when super young and it doesn't sound like Mil knows what she is doing. A slow neglectful death sounds horrible.", "Nta. Toddlers are not to be trusted with tiny animals, let alone to raise them. All of the caring will end up to you. And 5 chicks are difficult to raise and care for.", "NTA. What she did was idiotic.", "NTA \n\nJesus, maybe you should gift your MIL a cow and a camel to take care if in her own house for her next birthday.", "Gift-giving to children 101:  Always check with parents about large gifts (giant stuffed animals, playhouses, etc.), loud gifts (musical instruments, anything that talks or plays music), things that make messes (chemistry sets, sand art), and anything that's alive and needs to stay that way.  Pets often fit all those categories and just don't work without a lot of planning, learning, and compromise.", ">She said I was being dramatic and they're just baby chicks so they're going to die in 2 weeks anyways.\n\nNTA; MIL sounds like a piece. She didn't think your toddler would be disturbed by falling in love with baby chicks and seeing them die in 2 weeks. Only an AH would buy animals for children who are not old enough to raise them. Edited to add judgement.", "NTA\n\nYou're MIL sounds absolutely unhinged. You know exactly why you couldn't have a pet of this sort and MIL rail roaded you. \n\nI see that she took back the chicks, I would advise you against bringing your child to see them - do you really want them to witness the inhumane cruelty your MIL is going subject these animals to. \n\nI know it's a hard conversation to have with your 3 year old, but you have to explain that keeping innocent animals comes with responsibility for their welfare. That with each animal there needs to be certain things available to ensure that they're happy and chicks are not going to be happy inside an apartment.\n\nAs an aside you can buy caterpillars, watch them make their cocoons and transform into butterflies which you then release, takes only a few weeks and might be beneficial to you and your child.", "NTA. \n\nI have a hen sitting on eggs and expecting baby chicks any day now. Baby chicks require feeding and water daily, sometimes twice daily. In a brooder box with a heat lamp. You can start in a large plastic storage box for the first month but they will outgrow it by 6 weeks. You also have to monitor the heat lamp/plate and temperature to make sure it\u2019s not drafty, too hot, or too cold for the chicks and each week the temperature the chicks need it at will be different and you need to adjust the heat source. You\u2019ll need bedding in the box and to change that out regularly. The chicks poop a lot. And eat a lot. \n\nAfter they outgrow the box, they\u2019ll need to move into an outdoor coop because even by the time they are barely outgrowing the box they\u2019ll be dirtier and smellier than you prefer your house to be. If where you live has codes about chickens, most city codes only allow 3 hens, no roosters. So if you get this far, and have a place for a coop, you\u2019d have to ask the toddler which two beloved chickens to kill. \n\nBTW. Chicks don\u2019t die after 2 weeks. Ask your MIL where does she think eggs come from? \nSource: me successfully raising two batches of chicks to full grown egg laying hens and butchering roosters, in the country, with a coop, and an acre of land.\n\nAnd money: the set up for the chicks if you go as cheap as you can will probably run you $100 to start. Which you would have had to do immediately because those chicks need that heat asap. \nA prefab coop for 3 chickens or so is going to run you $300 minimum, if you find a good deal. Plus feeder and water. And feed. Growing chicks eat a lot, you\u2019d want the 50lbs bag easily. Oh and a way/place to store the food!", "Can someone explain to me why baby chicks are going to die in two weeks? Also why would anyone buy chickens to live in a apartament in the middle of the city. Is this one of those \"stupid American\" moments. Am I dumb.

No one should give pets as gifts, unless it's agreed upon beforehand.
