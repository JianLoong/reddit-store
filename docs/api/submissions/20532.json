That with each animal there needs to be certain things available to ensure that they're happy and chicks are not going to be happy inside an apartment.\n\nAs an aside you can buy caterpillars, watch them make their cocoons and transform into butterflies which you then release, takes only a few weeks and might be beneficial to you and your child.", "NTA. \n\nI have a hen sitting on eggs and expecting baby chicks any day now. Baby chicks require feeding and water daily, sometimes twice daily. In a brooder box with a heat lamp. You can start in a large plastic storage box for the first month but they will outgrow it by 6 weeks. You also have to monitor the heat lamp/plate and temperature to make sure it\u2019s not drafty, too hot, or too cold for the chicks and each week the temperature the chicks need it at will be different and you need to adjust the heat source. You\u2019ll need bedding in the box and to change that out regularly. The chicks poop a lot. And eat a lot. \n\nAfter they outgrow the box, they\u2019ll need to move into an outdoor coop because even by the time they are barely outgrowing the box they\u2019ll be dirtier and smellier than you prefer your house to be. If where you live has codes about chickens, most city codes only allow 3 hens, no roosters. So if you get this far, and have a place for a coop, you\u2019d have to ask the toddler which two beloved chickens to kill. \n\nBTW. Chicks don\u2019t die after 2 weeks. Ask your MIL where does she think eggs come from? \nSource: me successfully raising two batches of chicks to full grown egg laying hens and butchering roosters, in the country, with a coop, and an acre of land.\n\nAnd money: the set up for the chicks if you go as cheap as you can will probably run you $100 to start. Which you would have had to do immediately because those chicks need that heat asap. \nA prefab coop for 3 chickens or so is going to run you $300 minimum, if you find a good deal. Plus feeder and water. And feed. Growing chicks eat a lot, you\u2019d want the 50lbs bag easily. Oh and a way/place to store the food!", "Can someone explain to me why baby chicks are going to die in two weeks? Also why would anyone buy chickens to live in a apartament in the middle of the city.

I can\u2019t imagine she\u2019s giving them the basic necessities, and I definitely don\u2019t see her owning a heat lamp for them which they may still need if they\u2019re young enough.", "Taking them to a farm would be an excellent opportunity to show your child where chicks belong.  You can take your child to the farm and show the chicks grow up.", "My buddy and I had that same assumption about baby chicks likely dying in a few weeks when I was a teenager and we bought a couple colored easter chicks.  By winter we had 2 full-size roosters.  My parents were not thrilled.  Best guard dog we ever had though.", "Dude, it's time to keep your kid away from MIL. Holy shit this is actually unhinged.", "Reminds me of people buying bunny rabbits at Easter and black cats at Halloween, just to give them up and toss them out after the holiday weeks pass by. People that treat them as just toys and decorations instead of living things that need care. Nothing makes me more mad than the abuse of animals honestly, fuck this woman, those chicks could easily live up to a decade", "Fair point. Didn\u2019t even think about that\nIt would probably be a lot better than ducklings lol!", "You could try telling her you changed your mind after seeing how sad your son is and would like to take them to get her to give them to you. Then dont tell her you rehomed them, just say they died, she apparently doesnt think they'll live very long anyways.", "This is the comment OP needs to see!! Why is she coming here asking for opinions and then coming up with excuses to actually do the right thing?? I understand having anxiety especially when it comes to family, but maybe you should switch your anxiety to be about 5 little helpless animals that are being abused\u2026 this entire situation is sick and after reading OPs replies I\u2019m more upset with her then I am with the MIL.", "I actually have realized this and am actively looking to a place to take them and care for them properly.", "I loved him. I think I took good care of him. This was when I was in high school, and then college. I\u2019ve since learned that the habitat  humans provide is cruel compared to their natural homes. We had a big tank with a nice set up - plants, pebbles and some other fishy friends (non bettas - they don\u2019t get along).", "NTA\n\nYour reasons are logical. Besides, chicks are delicate pets and toddlers are impetuous and not aware of their strength: a bad combination, especially for chicks.", "And then she can explain why they aren't there in 2 weeks.\n\nDefinitely call someone before then to get those chicks a real home.", "Please demand she explain why she thinks they will die in two weeks! Is she not going to feed them or give them water? If your mother is okay with neglecting and torturing baby animals, I would not ever let her babysit your child. Chicks are not toys- they are baby chickens! Chickens live a long time. She has a massive cruel streak and you need to address that.", "That is literally animal cruelty. You need to either get those chicks back or involve an authority who can. \n\nHer city may also have led and regulations about owning chickens and I\u2019m certain keeping them in her condo is not legal.", "What if nobody kills them, what are you going to do with 5 chickens in a condo. This is weird", "Uh- farms don't want your poorly cared for and possibly diseased chicks. They have their own.", "I get you don\u2019t want to but these are LIVING creatures and you kind of owe it to them if you know your MIL is going to let them starve. In a lot of countries you could even be tried for animal abuse or enabling animal abuse in cases like this one. But I read you are going to take them to a farm so that is a positive note.", "Yeah. When it involves life or death for innocent beings nobody is going to be sympathetic over that. Sorry, not sorry tbh.", "Please get your spouse involved. She is their mother. You\u2019re not an AH for being caught up in a problem of her making. The chicks are not your responsibility. You already did handle the first confrontation- not letting her dump these animals with you. You are a good person- that\u2019s why you care about their wellbeing and are asking about it here. Ultimately though, they are out of your control, so while you can try to help, or try confrontation, or try to get your spouse to fix this, in the end, it\u2019s on her.", "Hey here's the line though. I'm anxious-avoidant about confrontation too - but these are living beings. They have no voice for themselves. They depend on us to be their voice. Some things are more important than avoiding confrontation.", "Thank you, thank you, thank yor. Your other comments came across like you just didn't care anymore as long as you didn't have to deal with the confrontation.", "\"well they weren't cute anymore\"", "Either your mother-in-law is genuinely not a smart person, or she knew that giving a toddler a bunch of delicate and vulnerable animals wasn't gonna fly, and wanted to make you look bad for saying no\n\nTell her to kick rocks\n\nNTA", "Any pet seems expendable to her", "Nothing creates a happy childhood memory like watching animals slowly die /s", "They'll be dead within 2 days without a heat lamp!", "What could be my option? I'm asking genuinely because I have never had chicks before and don't know how to care for them.", "She has been giving them food like rice and water, but is in no way the right way to take care of them.", "Agreed! Got chickens during the pandemic. My house was covered in dust for the first month until it was warm enough to be graduated to the garage ( with a heat lamp) Next they graduated to the back yard which they destroyed! Now the have a proper long run with shelter. They been a fun hobby but they are destructive as hell. Also, one turned out to be a rooster. Good luck with that!", "10\\10", "She doesn\u2019t care since she won\u2019t have to deal with it. She just wants to be the \u2018fun grandma\u2019 who got the pets in the first place!", "Rice is horrible for birds! I agree- call animal control.", "Shes literally killing them. This is disgusting.", "No wonder they're dying after two weeks! Rice is not suitable food for newborn chicks.", "Give them away to someone who wants backyard chickens.\n\nFarms are businesses they don't \"rehome\" pets. And very especially not birds these days with all the flu. Used to be you could bring them back to the farm store but I doubt they would take them these days.\n\nPlus you don't even know if these are male or female- no-one wants males.", "Where is your husband in all of this? Why does the responsibility to reason with *his* mother fall entirely on you?", "Not the police. Call animal control. Or better yet, your spouse can call animal control. Or he can go get the chicks himself and take them to a farm.", "That is sad and just plain mean of her. I hope you will find a place for them before they are all dead.", "Rice?? I thought people stopped throwing rice at weddings because birds can\u2019t eat it??? These chickens need chick feed!", "Where is your spouse in all this? Why haven\u2019t THEY handled their mother? Why is this all on you?", "I know that your son is sad now - but think of how traumatised he would have been if they did die.", "Plus feeder and water. And feed. Growing chicks eat a lot, you\u2019d want the 50lbs bag easily,,", "We had a big tank with a nice set up - plants,,", "If any of those chicks are male,,", " I can't imagine how heartbroken the kid will be,,", " I just feel for the poor animals falling into her hands.", "BTW. Chicks don\u2019t die after 2 weeks. Ask your MIL where does she think eggs come from? Source: me successfully raising two batches of chicks to full grown egg laying hens and butchering roosters, in the country, with a coop, and an acre of land.", "You\u2019re absolutely right", "Yep.  Rice is around 7% crude protein.  Female egg chicks need between 18-22% (unless that wisdom has changed in the last five years).  Not to mention all the other nutrients missing.\n\nOP, she's *starving* these animals and you might be the only person who can intervene.", "He actually called his mom and told her off as well. He also will be driving the chicks down to the farm when we find one to rehome them to!", "agree with you.", "I keep quiet and handle it as best as possible trying not to offend the giver.", "You were right to give the birds away to a place that can actually care for them,,", "Neighbour had a parrot who was basically free range in his apartment.  Sadly, the owner had severe mobility issues, and was dealing with serious depression, and just gave up on cleaning up.\n\nHe moved out last winter, and the new owners had to basically gut the place, because Jack had done so much damage pooping and just being a parrot.", "NTA you don't give a child a pet \"that's going to die in 2 weeks\" that would be traumatic for the child! Anyone doing that I wouldn't leave them alone with my child.\n\nYou also don't give anyone a pet without knowing for certain that it's wanted.\n\nChickens in a condo/apartment??? Your MIL needs mental help and also needs to learn boundaries.", "After given three specific reasons why you don\u2019t want your toddler to have a pet.", "They are. You totally can have pet chickens in an appartment. However, it requires a lot of time, patience and knowledge. If you don't have the resources, I wouldn't recommend it. Otherwise, they make wonderful pets. I love chickens so much.", "Then dont tell her you rehomed them,", "Sounds great, but unfortunately inappropriate gifting of animals often leads to conflict."]}
