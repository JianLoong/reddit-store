For example, Australian English or British English has differences to U.S. English in expressions, vocabulary, spelling, etc. If your Indian colleague were living in the U.S., they might want to learn and conform with U.S. expressions.

You can't teach them the entire dictionary or predict what they may get wrong. \n\nSince we are here: I literally just picked up my dictionary to check I wasn't going mad; revert can be used to mean to return (as in to a prior state); to return to a subject (i.e. in conversation); or to pass on to another holder (the context in which your colleague is using this word).", "But the only example you gave was the correct use of a word.

English as a primary language is largely dominated by the United States. That influence continues via the vast media and entertainment exports. Yes, lots of Indians speak English in some capacity.

It's weird that they're going after me though, because my original vote was NTA (before someone kindly informed me that it was a dialect difference and not just incorrect grammar). Now I'm not entirely sure where I fall because while I acknowledge it is a valid dialect, the colleague is working for an American company with American clientele who may be confused by the different word. \n\nThat drives me nuts too.

They are. In their respective countries. Countries with populations much smaller, and with far less global cultural prevalence. Australia\u2019s English population is about the size of NY state.
