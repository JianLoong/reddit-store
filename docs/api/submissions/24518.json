In the middle of my treatment and at a particularly low point, my brother and/or his wife made a false report to DCF (Department of Children and Families) saying that my daughter was neglected.  There were specific allegations like she was wearing dirty clothes to school, living in an unsanitary house, etc, all false.

My parents had instantly thought so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDCF interviewed me but decided the report was bogus and didn\u2019t investigate. But they had called her school, they called my ex.

This meant that they were not as available to my brother, and he did have some problems during that period.  He injured his back, meaning he could not work for a few months and needed surgery.  But he had disability money and a wife to help, and he was still getting around. Also, his wife depended to some degree on my mother for emotional support, which must have been less available. Finally, my brother is just kind of a dick in the first place, a right-wing blowhard with authoritarian / racist tendencies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently, my brother told my parents (not me) that his \\*marriage counselor\\* had been the one to call DCF, and that he had lied because he was embarrassed.

To me this confirms it was them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEarlier of this year, I snapped at him once and made a reference to this situation. From there, he decided to refuse to be in my presence \u2014 to be clear, \\*not\\* the other way around.  Now my mother sees this as an estrangement that I may not be responsible for, but that I need to help straighten out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have said I\u2019m not having any conversation unless there\u2019s an admission / apology.

Your brother told the marriage counselor these lies, and the counselor (who is a mandatory reporter) felt compelled to make the report. Still definitely his fault as he completely fabricated lies and told someone who is legally required to report suspected child abuse/neglect.

A friend of hers once was telling her about visiting a neighbor and watching the husband backhand the son for 'being disrespectful.' My mom encouraged her to make a report, and my mom made a report as well. My mom didn't witness those specific things firsthand, but she included them in the report she made, because they were the details she was aware of (she did say in the report that this was secondhand information), and that's part of what you're supposed to include when you make the report.\n\nSo, for example, if your brother was in therapy and he or his wife were talking about you, and they exaggerated something (for example, say your daughter showed up to a visit with a shirt with a stain on it) and they told the counselor 'she lets her walk around in filthy clothes,' that would go in the report. If they told the counselor that your house was unfit for habitation and you had a child living with you part time, that would go in the report as well.\n\nIt sounds like what's most likely is that your brother or his wife were talking shit about you, got too overblown, got exaggerated, and then the counselor made the report because she's legally obligated to do so at that point.", "Nah that\u2019s BS.

No doubt in my mind he did it just incase you might ever find out the name of who reported you", "Yeah, I get that I'm an unreliable narrator. Another thing my mother said: he's aware that I have thought for years that he was not a good person.  It's true, I didn't think he was a good person even before this, and I'm frankly surprised he was observant enough to notice.  We didn't really have any confrontations about it.  Once many years ago he started posting racist stuff about immigrants on facebook and I called him out, him + wife blocked me. That's the only confrontation I can think of.  His opinions, which I heard at holidays, have gotten worse since then (George Floyd had it coming for not obeying the police.) But my mother is implying that there are other things I did. She won't say what though because she wants me to ask him and for us to work it out.

Also counsellors are always supposed to tell someone that they are making a report, so there\u2019s a very good chance your brother/SIL knew full well that DCF would be contacted - it\u2019s crap of him to let you go through that while in treatment/recovery.

I have the same last name as my brother and I'm the only one on the internet with that name. Possibly my phone number was on there somewhere, or maybe the DCF people have some other way of getting it.  I don't know if it matters which DCF office you call.  Daughter has a different last name but that probably wouldn't matter.

The fact that someone called DCF and you never found out who is a mystery that drove you crazy.

I have been estranged from my sister for about 5 years and it was the best decision I ever made. I only wish I'd done it sooner.\n\nIf it is your mom or other family wanting peace, they can tell your brother to stop being a dick just as easily. Realistically you can just not spend time in his company and if you get invited to the same events just move to another room. If he follows you, leave the party and tell people if they want you there he needs to leave you alone.\n\nIf you need access to your family for some reason (child care maybe?) it might be harder, but not impossible.

I'm glad that it was your brother who cut contact, so your mom's wrath (one hopes) can be aimed toward him.  But all in all, it's a really good thing that he and SIL are NC with you.  I can't imagine what possible benefit there is for you and your child to have people like that in your lives.\n\nLet your mom have a wholly separate relationship with your brother if she wishes, you shouldn't have to be a part of it.  Let alone make overtures to get him to be in contact with you again.\n\nClearly, he can't be trusted either to be truthful or not to try to upend you life in the most egregious (and illegal) way possible.

We're not close to start with and this is making it worse, and I feel bad for standing in the way of it getting better. And theoretically so my daughter can see her cousin (M7). I haven't told her why we haven't seen them in a while, sometimes she asks, though not often. I don't need anything from anyone in the family.\n\nAnd also, I have to admit, to force my parents to stand up for me / against him for once. Which is another possible AH thing on my part. He's been a boor in a number of ways. Probably the worst is he+wife vanished when my grandmother (mother's mother) died last year. She'd never spent much time with us and was never very nice to my mother or us,  I didn't much like her, and that family was all messed up. But, my mother had been in charge of her care for years, and it was her mother. She was 95 and long gone with dementia but at some point something turned and we knew she was going to go shortly. So the family would get together at the nursing home every night for, I dunno, 10 days or so. I went, not every night (I'm not the hero in this story either), but I was with my mother when grandmother passed. It was 1 am and there was nobody except us there.  So my mother wasn't alone when that happened, and we've had a lot of issues so I was glad that I could be there. It was just luck though, I can't take too much credit for it. But I ran errands and stuff too, stuff for the funeral.\n\nBut brother+wife never showed up once, never even called to check in. He might have been away on work (he's a pilot) for some of those nights. But wife didn't go either (though she would have had to bring her son.) They also did not go to the wake or funeral because they had a trip to Disney, which I can sort of understand as those are expensive and they'd have lost some money. (My mother had said it was ok and they should go.)\n\nBut I don't understand not talking to my mother at all about this, even after, and why we're letting it go.

What's your take on that?\n\nBrother: Well, that's bullshit. She's just struggling right now because usually she talks about her feelings with my mother, and my mother doesn't have the time now because my sister is just all over the place and my mom has to deal with that.\n\nCounselor: What do you mean?\n\nBrother: Yeah, my sis is getting divorced and my mother has to take care of my niece, otherwise she would get nothing to eat and walk around in dirty clothes.

If your brother told them a bunch of false information about you and the child, that counselor would be forced to make the report because they're mandatory abuse reporter.\n\nYour brother telling false information to a mandatory abusive reporter is the same as making a false report themselves.", "Yeah I think this is true. In fact it's my understanding that mandatory reporters aren't allowed to be anonymous in this state. But not 100% sure.", "[removed]", "https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubpdfs/manda.pdf\n\n\u201cTypically, a report must be made when the reporter, *in his or her official capacity*, suspects or has reason to believe that a child has been abused or neglected\u201d (pg. 4)", "You seem pretty put together. I don't think you need your brother's BS in your life. As a parent, I'm sure you can understand you want your children to get along. At the same time, I'm sure your mother can understand not wanting a racist ass in your life. Set some conditions before meeting if you're really torn: a true apology and actual repentance, becoming non-racist, etc. He probably won't meet the conditions but that's on him.", "Maybe that\u2019s the case in your state, it isn\u2019t in mine. Do you report every time someone mentions child abuse on Reddit?", "Just coming to agree with you! Your mom likely didn\u2019t need to report what she heard from a friend.", "NTA\n\nThe issue, as I understand it, is whether you need to \"straighten the situation out\" to reduce stress on your parents.  I say no, you don't have this obligation toward your parents.  You need to decide for yourself whether to heal the estrangement or let it carry on.  If the estrangement carries on,  make sure that you keep it low key and low drama so that your parents are caught in the middle as little as possible. \n\nLet's operate on the assumption that your brother did something wrong, either intentionally or unintentionally, either knowing or not knowing what the outcome would be.  In other words, he effed up big time.   I don't think you're ever going to get an admission or apology from him, especially if he believes he acted in good faith.\n\nThis happened four years ago and counting. DCF correctly did their job and dismissed the matter.  It's over. \n\nWhat matters, in my view, is how he has behaved since then.  If he's been a decent brother since then it might be better for your well being and mental health to let go of your resentment about what happened.  If need be, get therapy to help you do this.  If he has  continued to be a clueless jerk about other things, then it might be better to take the estrangement as a blessing and carry on with it.", "Nta keep that ah away from you", "NTA.  That man deserves nothing from you and if he chooses not to spend time with you, that is a win for you.  Tell your mom to drop it and go on with your life free of this insane, untrustworthy man you happen to be related to.", "You are NTA, but your brother certainly is one.", "Fuck the brother. NTA.", "NTA and please UpdateMe", "Taking out all the conversations about mandatory reporters and what needs to be reported, you are NTA for not wanting to reconcile with your brother. The specifics of what he did -  whether he called DCS or caused someone else to call the, is beside the point. He made false accusations that COULD have caused you to lose custody of your daughter.\n\ntl;dr - NTA, brother is", "That's an interesting idea, but I don't know who she is.", "Hah yeah, they didn't think it though", "In the state of Ohio veterinarians are mandatory reporters if we suspect animal abuse, we have to report it because of the connection between animal abuse and abuse of children/people.", "Fair enough. She was a teacher so I knew she was a mandated reporter in that capacity, and she'd heard this from a friend and made a report, so I guess I put the two together in my head, but I don't know if that's officially the policy. Regardless, the example stands that someone with that type of training, when making a report, would include specific details that they'd heard secondhand.", "NTA. Go no contact because he sounds worthless.", "Nta- i would never trust your brother again", "Right- but they need her personal info to do that, don't they?  Like her address or where the kids' school is, stuff like that.\n\nThere's a big difference between telling a therapist \"I'm upset because my sister is XYZ\" and \"My sister is XYZ.  Here's her name and she lives at this address.\"", "Why would that seem odd? \nIn our  jurisdiction all therapists are mandated reporters.", "It's possible your brother used the fact the counsellor was a mandated reporter to insulate himself from blow back. He lied to get them to make the report, that way his \"problem\" is dealt with and he isn't to \"blame\" because he didn't actually make the report.", "There's probably not going to be anything to update. I wish there would be.", "Brother and SIL probably found common ground in but hung about you during the session and he wanted to keep it going by including lies and didn\u2019t expect the report to come.", "I\u2019ve seen many men turn into your brother for no reason other than \u201cbeing a man\u201d and \u201cnot getting everything they expected out of life.\u201d \n\nThe only thing their upbringings really had in common was parents who didn\u2019t really go out of their way to explicitly instill empathy, respect, and anti-authoritarian values. They might have been raised in vaguely liberal homes, but it never really went too far beyond \u201cbeing bigoted is wrong!\u201d They never internalized *why* bigotry is wrong, they were just *told* that it is, and frankly, that \u201cwrongness\u201d is kind of appealing to a young man who feels frustrated about how his life is progressing. It gives him easy targets to blame for his shortcomings and an easy way to horrify a parent he resents, with no real consequences that he can see (going back to never being taught *why* bigotry is wrong). If he never developed empathy for people who are different from him, why should he care if what he says and does are harmful to them? It feels good to claw back a sense of superiority when he\u2019s feeling stunted and mediocre, and if it annoys mom & dad, even better. Instant attention *and* Sticking It To The Man in one easy step. \n\nIt\u2019s rarely deeper than that. Unmet expectations, generalized resentment, low empathy for others and a lack of (noticeable) consequences.", "It's a stretch to know why, but if he had said my first name, then counselor could have searched with his last name and that brings up me and only me.  If she knew the state, anyone could find me from property records if nothing else. Not sure about the phone number but I doubt it's hard to get.", "> This is not true\n\nNo, this is true.", "I wish I could upvote this more. It's pretty much exactly the situation. My mother says things like \"he just has low empathy\" and I say \"ok but that's not a disability, like he can't change it. He has low empathy, he's a dick.\""]}
