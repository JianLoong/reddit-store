He doesn\u2019t come into this).  In the middle of my treatment and at a particularly low point, my brother and/or his wife made a false report to DCF (Department of Children and Families) saying that my daughter was neglected.  There were specific allegations like she was wearing dirty clothes to school, living in an unsanitary house, etc, all false. It was anonymous but to make a long story short, there were strong reasons to believe that brother + wife were the ones who made the call.  My parents had instantly thought so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDCF interviewed me but decided the report was bogus and didn\u2019t investigate. But they had called her school, they called my ex.  We were divorcing and if he \\*had\\* decided to be an AH bad things could have happened.  Not to even mention the stress this put me under at what was already easily the lowest point in my life physically and mentally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor a couple of years nothing happened.  Brother + wife denied that they had been involved. There was nothing anyone could do, and there was still the remote possibility that some nurse might have called (but why make up these details?)  Mostly my life went on but now and then when I thought about it and how we were all sweeping it under the rug I was mad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would brother + wife do this?  Being a cancer patient in a major depression, I was very needy. I was staying with my parents. This meant that they were not as available to my brother, and he did have some problems during that period.  He injured his back, meaning he could not work for a few months and needed surgery.  But he had disability money and a wife to help, and he was still getting around. Also, his wife depended to some degree on my mother for emotional support, which must have been less available. Finally, my brother is just kind of a dick in the first place, a right-wing blowhard with authoritarian / racist tendencies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently, my brother told my parents (not me) that his \\*marriage counselor\\* had been the one to call DCF, and that he had lied because he was embarrassed. But why would the counselor make a report with such specific lies?  Okay, what if she didn\u2019t think she was lying, but that means that brother + wife told her those specific things. To me this confirms it was them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEarlier of this year, I snapped at him once and made a reference to this situation. From there, he decided to refuse to be in my presence \u2014 to be clear, \\*not\\* the other way around.  Now my mother sees this as an estrangement that I may not be responsible for, but that I need to help straighten out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have said I\u2019m not having any conversation unless there\u2019s an admission / apology. But it's a strain on my parents.

Your brother told the marriage counselor these lies, and the counselor (who is a mandatory reporter) felt compelled to make the report. Still definitely his fault as he completely fabricated lies and told someone who is legally required to report suspected child abuse/neglect. NTA", "If your brother told her those specific things, she would include them in the report. \n\nFor example, my mom is a mandatory reporter. A friend of hers once was telling her about visiting a neighbor and watching the husband backhand the son for 'being disrespectful.' My mom encouraged her to make a report, and my mom made a report as well. My mom didn't witness those specific things firsthand, but she included them in the report she made, because they were the details she was aware of (she did say in the report that this was secondhand information), and that's part of what you're supposed to include when you make the report.\n\nSo, for example, if your brother was in therapy and he or his wife were talking about you, and they exaggerated something (for example, say your daughter showed up to a visit with a shirt with a stain on it) and they told the counselor 'she lets her walk around in filthy clothes,' that would go in the report. If they told the counselor that your house was unfit for habitation and you had a child living with you part time, that would go in the report as well.\n\nIt sounds like what's most likely is that your brother or his wife were talking shit about you, got too overblown, got exaggerated, and then the counselor made the report because she's legally obligated to do so at that point.", "Nah that\u2019s BS. How would your brother\u2019s therapist know you and your child\u2019s name and where they could find you? This is complete BS.", "To be clear he most definitely used her as she has to report by law. No doubt in my mind he did it just incase you might ever find out the name of who reported you", "Yeah, I get that I'm an unreliable narrator. Another thing my mother said: he's aware that I have thought for years that he was not a good person.  It's true, I didn't think he was a good person even before this, and I'm frankly surprised he was observant enough to notice.  We didn't really have any confrontations about it.  Once many years ago he started posting racist stuff about immigrants on facebook and I called him out, him + wife blocked me. That's the only confrontation I can think of.  His opinions, which I heard at holidays, have gotten worse since then (George Floyd had it coming for not obeying the police.) But my mother is implying that there are other things I did. She won't say what though because she wants me to ask him and for us to work it out.  So another reason I might be the AH is because I've forgotten them.  \n\nI don't think this is true, but it's an argument.", "I have seen this happen to a relative of mine - they spoke to a psychologist about some stuff that the father of their children was doing that they weren\u2019t sure about and, being a mandatory reporter the psych decided to report it. \nMy relative was never out to f with the ex, but does have a habit of overblowing and dramatising things - OP your brother sounds like an AH who probably did the same or didn\u2019t bother to provide context etc. You\u2019re definitely not the AH though, it sounds like you\u2019ve had a hell of a battle and if your brother was so concerned about your children while you were struggling he should have umm spoken to ~you~ maybe? Also counsellors are always supposed to tell someone that they are making a report, so there\u2019s a very good chance your brother/SIL knew full well that DCF would be contacted - it\u2019s crap of him to let you go through that while in treatment/recovery. Omg what an ah!! At the very least they should own up and apologise asap. Good luck \ud83d\udc95", "Is a marriage counselor a mandatory reporter? That seems odd", "Well, I thought about this.  I have the same last name as my brother and I'm the only one on the internet with that name. Possibly my phone number was on there somewhere, or maybe the DCF people have some other way of getting it.  I don't know if it matters which DCF office you call.  Daughter has a different last name but that probably wouldn't matter.  So I guess it's unlikely that the counselor google-stalked me, but it's not impossible."]}
