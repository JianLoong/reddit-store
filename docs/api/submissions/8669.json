She is not a reliable person to be around your children nor a good example of how healthy relationships work.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nShe's awful--the classic manipulative, vindictive MIL.\n\nYou don't owe her anything. On the contrary, she is a problem in your life and those of your family. Let her stew in her juices and never speak to her again.\n\nAnd NEVER apologize to a MIL, no matter what. It just encourages them.", "NTA this is a good lesson for her, grandparents feel too entitled, the reality is the child is not theirs, they have no say, they don\u2019t even have the right to know the child that\u2019s all up to the parents and no one else, toxic is toxic no matter who it is and children shouldn\u2019t be around that", "NTA\n\nIt would be more painful to the children if they developed a relationship with her, and she walked out again", "As a grandchild of toxic grandmother I say NTA. We (me and my sister) were forced to spend holidays with her and we hated it. She was verbally abusive to our mother (her DIL) and toward us. We both went gradually from LC to NC as adults. She hasn't attended our weddings, never saw our kids. Protect your kids from toxicity. Honestly I'm not sure if I'm gonna attend her funeral (maybe for sake of my dad, but definitely not to pay her respect, she doesn't deserve any).", "I don't think her assessment is incorrect.\n\nYou're saying a bunch of things that amounts to \"She came by unannounced\" and \"she uploaded pictures to social media\".\n\nThe extreme you have gone to is to bar her from seeing her grandchildren and then take the unnecessary step of not allowing her to see pictures of your grandchildren. The former could arguably be construed as being protective. The latter is driven by pure spite.\n\nWithout hearing your mother in laws side of the story, you have painted the picture of someone who uses others as leverage.", "What did you say in your original message. You gloss over this part of the story which is interesting.", "Except when it is about them.
