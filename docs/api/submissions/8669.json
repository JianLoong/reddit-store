And she might be right, u say u want to be low contact but u don\u2019t even want to send photos ever. That feels cruel and that feels like  punishment. Because if u did want a relationship but keep it low because of previous issues, photos would be the perfect answer. \n\n\nI think maybe you just don\u2019t like your mother in law and you\u2019re trying to make her look like the crazy unreasonable one. When truth is, from what you\u2019re saying, there\u2019s not much to say about her. Her crime is being excited to have grandkids.

You might need to know about \nr/JUSTNOMIL", "Are you nitpicking at her every move, though? What exactly is she saying and doing that you're having this reaction to?\n\nMy MIL is no joy to be around - but it's not malicious. She has some issues that were never really dealt with (mental health wise) and she's all sorts of difficult. From my interactions with her, its obvious she suffered from PTSD with her first two children and now has anxiety (specifically social anxiety, which is probably why she's so tense until she feels more comfortable). But she loves her grandchild and I've always done my best to foster that relationship - sometimes that means turning a blind eye...many blind eyes. But it makes my partners life easier and my kid loves her so it's fine. My partner has gone to a lot of effort with my own mum...who isn't a walk in the park, either. \n\nIt really depends on you. It's not about being TA or not...I'm sure you have your reasons. I've managed teams at work and had to navigate difficult personalities but I couldn't just fire everyone I found challenging so you work with them, compromise, find ways around things...try to make them feel needed/wanted.

I have an toddler. She and I had a major disagreement around my fathers death, at which point in time she told me that she wished my son was dead.

I made it very clear to my husband and siblings that they were not to share pictures of my son with her or discuss him with her ever again.", "NTA.

You still have an obligation to protect the kiddos from toxic people- unfortunately that sometimes means people who are biologically related to you/the kids. In my case- it\u2019s my own bio dad who will never be allowed within 100 metres of my kid because he\u2019s toxic. MIL has proved more than once that she can\u2019t respect yours & hubby\u2019s boundaries or acknowledge that she was the problem. Time to encourage the NC to continue. If the kiddos get curious or want to see her when they\u2019re older then support them in that choice.

OP said her mother in law didn't respond well to being told she was breaking boundaries.she was being intrusive into OPs life and shared news that wasn't hers to share.

She is not ignoring you or being unmindful of her problems.

One set of my grandparents got cut off completely when I was the age of your first kid. \n\nI knew they existed, but they were never part of my life. I know enough about why they were cut off that I don\u2019t regret that at all. \n\nWhen your kids get older, you and your husband will have to explain that MIL made the choice to not be in their lives. \n\nYour MIL has repeatedly shown you who she is.
