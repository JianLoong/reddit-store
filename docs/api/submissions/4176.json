Your parents decided to play stupid games, and now they won their stupid prize.\n\n'I'm not sure' and stringing you along, is usually code for 'I'm not that interested, but you're better than nothing so I'll keep you as a backup until something better comes along'. Don't feel bad for not going along with this crap.", "You're obviously Plan B for your parents.\n\nNTA, do your thing.", "NTA\n\nYou asked them at the beginning of November. That's a more than reasonable span of time to take a decision. How long did they want you to wait? Until Christmas Eve?\n\nEnjoy house/pet sitting!", "NTA. It's discourteous to not commit or decline an invitation so the host can plan. They were really just waiting for a better offer.", "NTA. It's incredibly disrespectful for them to just dangle their decision over your head for weeks & incredibly childish for them to start wailing when you decide to do something actually worth your while instead, in the face of their obvious reluctance to commit to spending time with you.", "NTA, you tried to communicate with your parents, and they only spoke chicken crap.", "NTA\n\nLet them continue waiting for the better offer they think they are getting and move on. You've done everything reasonable, now go take care of yourself.\n\nNext year, is there 1 family member who could host everyone? Ask the person with the space and offer to help.", "NTA. You gave them over a month. They have made it clear at least one of them doesn't want to go to your place, so it's fair to say \"It was pretty clear you didn't want to come.\" Also, they were clearly waiting to see if something \"better\" came up and, if not, would say yes at the last minute. You are at no fault and I'd guess some of this is why your relationship is strained. You tried. You get credit for inviting them, no need to feel guilt or responsibility how things turned out. Make sure they know you won't be home, in case they try to pull the \"oh we just thought of you, so lonely, but then you weren't home when we showed up unannounced Christmas Eve! So rude of you!\" \ud83d\ude44 I hope you have fun pet sitting!!", "NTA at all. They are grown ups who should be able to make a decisive plan for something like Christmas instead of being vague and non-committal.", "NTA\n\nYour parents are using you as a fallback option. If their plans fall through with your siblings, they'll come visit you.\n\nGo make some money.", "Nope NTA here.", "NTA, you asked them, they didn\u2019t say yes so you made other plans, your life your choices.", "NTA their inability to commit is not your problem.", "NTA. They have had plenty of opportunities to confirm plans yet they are still choosing not to.", "NTA.  If you've asked multiple times and they never gave you a straight answer, I don't see anything wrong with making other plans, especially if those other plans are helping your financial situation.", "NTA. You gave them plenty of time to give you an answer.", "NTA. Unless someone has a legitimate reason for needing to wait to accept/decline an invite (AND communicates that reason, giving an idea of when they\u2019ll have an answer) it\u2019s rude to make someone wait. I would take it same as you, if they\u2019re wavering then they don\u2019t really want to come, so you shouldn\u2019t have to be a sitting duck catering to their indecision.", "NTA\n\nIf they still can't commit, then you are forced to make plans without them.\n\nMake the money.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your an after thought for them, they want the grandkids. \n\nGo house sit, if they wanted to be with you for xmas, they would have made plans with you instead of giving you the run around.", "\"Hey folks, since we never formalized plans, I decided to do this job instead.

It's why formal invitations come with RSVP dates\n\nAnother way to handle frustrating situations like this when you *don't* have definitive plans yourself is to stop promising to be available. You do that by saying something like, \"No pressure! Let me know if you decide to come and I'll let you know if I am still available\"", "NTA", "NTA - This seems almost like your last the last resort for them. They are waiting to see if they get an invite from your siblings with grandkids before they give you a definite answer (IMO).

It usually means: We're waiting until the last minute for a better offer, and will accept yours only if nothing better presents. \n\nTake it for the fairly convoluted \"No\" that it is and don't spend another thought on it.", "NTA. They are adults acting like children.  If they can't make a decision in a week, then they aren't coming.", "Dont treat someone as a priority who treats you like an afterthought", "NTA.  You've asked and they have not managed a good reply.  At this point you have someone asking for help and want to, so it makes more sense to go with that.", "Nailed it.  They're currently pressuring the families with kids to invite them and want op to be the back up.\n\nAnd it's pretty damning that all the adult kids with children are refusing to spend Christmas with them.  \n\nWhen either said \"oh [other] doesn't want to go\" - damn that is hurtful. That is when I would have rescinded the invitation and had a serious talk.  *Both* blaming the other? Ugh. No."]}
