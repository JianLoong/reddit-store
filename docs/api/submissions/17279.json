MIL was traveling so there were only me, fiance and his brother and their friends. They bought some alcohol for the Saturday night (this is relevant). In Saturday night they all drank and played beer bong in the kitchen. This friend Mark started to look at my chest and make it clear he liked what he saw. I had dress, neither revealing nor transparent, so I tried to hide my chest but staring didn't stop. I then decided to brush my teeth and went Niel's bedroom to get toothbrush. I brushed my teeth in bathroom because Sean or Niel needed it. He followed me to the bathroom and blocked my way so I couldn't go back to other rooms. In a while, Mark let me through so I went to sit with my fiance in the living room after putting my toothbrush to backpack. Mark walked up to me and grabbed my chest. I froze and my fiance was like wtf, what he just do. Niel and Sean didn't saw none of this. Rest of the night was just ruined for everyone we all went to sleep.\n\nIn the morning, me and my fiance told everyone what happened because Mark lost his memory and Niel and Sean didn't know what happened. Later Mark texted to my fiance that I should've told someone to avoid this and he was blaming alcohol. Niel and MIL told me to talk to Mark and forgive him. I talked to him but I never said i forgave him. Because what happened, I got some kind of trauma, and changed my clothes to cover more and I got body discomfort. I also get anxious every time I hear his voice and can't relax in MIL's house if he's there too. Recently he found out that I had muted him in discord and asked for my fiance that why I had muted him and can't I just forgive him already. So AITA for not forgive him?\n\nEdit 1. Many has asked if my fiance has supported me and yes, he has. We have had several discussions about him being contact with this friend and the biggest reason is that this friend knows stuff which could possibly lead my partner into big troubles, no blackmailing, but fear that \"friend\" would tell someone. So it's like \"keep friends close and enemies closer\" mindset and my partner doesn't trust him. He doesn't hang out with him alone, only in MIL's place, and \"friend\" is surprisingly banned from our house for my safety and comfort.

This is sexual assault and by the sound of it hes taken no responsiblity, shown no remorse for his actions and just expects you to get over it. I wonder how often hes done this and just shrugged it off? Kind of disgusted your MIL and BIL have also been like 'just get over it'. I really hope your fiance has supported you and ended the friendship as well. If not, I think it's time for you to talk to him, point out how your behaviour has changed as a result of the ex friends actions, how you get scared and anxious just hearing his voice and ask your fiance why hes still friends with someone who assaulted you in such a way.", "never not NTA", "My fiance is his friend after that because this friend knows things which would hurt my fiance so trust is gone.", "Well this friend is my fiance and his brother's childhood friend so cutting isn't option.

How charming. /s\n\nNTA of course.", "It absolutely is an option.", "I understand, but I still think what the guy did is unforgivable in the eyes of almost anyone.

Remember, he does NOT have the right to touch you, nor to make you feel like you're showing too much. You were NOT naked, and still he made you feel like you were.

This is sensible especially since since it seems like cutting off Mark will lead to a lot of drama and it's easier to just keep him at a distance.", "I didn't see anything about whether she disagrees.  Does not dumping him count as agreeing?", "Right, but I think if she had a problem with this she would mention it in the post where she detailed every other aspect of the situation which greatly upset her.
