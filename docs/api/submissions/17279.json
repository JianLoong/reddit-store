MIL was traveling so there were only me, fiance and his brother and their friends. They bought some alcohol for the Saturday night (this is relevant). In Saturday night they all drank and played beer bong in the kitchen. This friend Mark started to look at my chest and make it clear he liked what he saw. I had dress, neither revealing nor transparent, so I tried to hide my chest but staring didn't stop. I then decided to brush my teeth and went Niel's bedroom to get toothbrush. I brushed my teeth in bathroom because Sean or Niel needed it. He followed me to the bathroom and blocked my way so I couldn't go back to other rooms. In a while, Mark let me through so I went to sit with my fiance in the living room after putting my toothbrush to backpack. Mark walked up to me and grabbed my chest. I froze and my fiance was like wtf, what he just do. Niel and Sean didn't saw none of this. Rest of the night was just ruined for everyone we all went to sleep.\n\nIn the morning, me and my fiance told everyone what happened because Mark lost his memory and Niel and Sean didn't know what happened. Later Mark texted to my fiance that I should've told someone to avoid this and he was blaming alcohol. Niel and MIL told me to talk to Mark and forgive him. I talked to him but I never said i forgave him. Because what happened, I got some kind of trauma, and changed my clothes to cover more and I got body discomfort. I also get anxious every time I hear his voice and can't relax in MIL's house if he's there too. Recently he found out that I had muted him in discord and asked for my fiance that why I had muted him and can't I just forgive him already. So AITA for not forgive him?\n\nEdit 1. Many has asked if my fiance has supported me and yes, he has. We have had several discussions about him being contact with this friend and the biggest reason is that this friend knows stuff which could possibly lead my partner into big troubles, no blackmailing, but fear that \"friend\" would tell someone. So it's like \"keep friends close and enemies closer\" mindset and my partner doesn't trust him. He doesn't hang out with him alone, only in MIL's place, and \"friend\" is surprisingly banned from our house for my safety and comfort.

He knew what he was doing and he knew he could use the alcohol as an excuse, being able to easily act like he couldn't remember the night before.

Whether he was drunk or not, he owes you a massive apology and a \"thank you\" for your not pressing charges against him.\n\n\"I can't believe how drunk i was last night\" is one of the oldest ways by which people try to deflect responsibility for their actions. By way of comparison: \"I was drunk\" doesn't excuse someone getting into a car wreck. If anything, this guy needs to cut way back on drinking and quit using it as an excuse for his behaviors. \n\nI'd encourage you and/or your fiance to tell his mother about what happened so that she can support you.

I think I need a T-shirt that says \"Being drunk does not excuse bad behaviour.\"  \nFor real though you don't owe him forgiveness not now, not ever; you might never want to forgive him and that would be okay or you might decide to forgive him tomorrow - it's up to you and you alone.", "NTA. F that guy and anyone trying to justify this BS as normal. He got drunk and assaulted you. Even if I'd buy that he \"doesn't remember\", his behaviour is unacceptable for showing ZERO remorse. If somebody justifies this BS by saying \"well, I blame alcohol and I was drunk\" and then doesn't even manage to be bloody mortified to your face about it, it's pretty goddamn clear what they think about their part. That guy has no right to ask anything of and can be goddamn happy that neither of you went to the cops, which frankly, you should've done.", "You were sexually assaulted and are asking if YTA?

This is sexual assault and by the sound of it hes taken no responsiblity, shown no remorse for his actions and just expects you to get over it. I wonder how often hes done this and just shrugged it off? Kind of disgusted your MIL and BIL have also been like 'just get over it'. I really hope your fiance has supported you and ended the friendship as well. If not, I think it's time for you to talk to him, point out how your behaviour has changed as a result of the ex friends actions, how you get scared and anxious just hearing his voice and ask your fiance why hes still friends with someone who assaulted you in such a way.", "never not NTA", "My fiance is his friend after that because this friend knows things which would hurt my fiance so trust is gone.", "Well this friend is my fiance and his brother's childhood friend so cutting isn't option. However friend is banned from our house for my safety and comfort.", "Biggest conflict is that I'm Christian and so is bil so forgiveness is important, but this is one thing I can't forgive. Bil says that I should just forgive whatever person did.", "My fiance has been biggest support after that with my childhood friend and sister. I'm lucky to have them.", "I felt ashamed for being assaulted and there would've been too much drama for me to handle if I reported him. I also blamed myself for freezing and not wear more covering clothes.", "I thought about going to report him but I was afraid. It has been common to me that nobody hears me and thought that he could just get away even if I report.", "My sister and childhood friend were my support along with my fiance. I couldn't tell my little brother (21) because of shame, but this is my real family. My father would blame me and my mother has alzheimer so she couldn't support me the way I needed.", "That's not friendship, that's coercion", "So Mark is a blackmailer too, as well as sexually assaulting you. How charming. /s\n\nNTA of course.", "It absolutely is an option.", "I understand, but I still think what the guy did is unforgivable in the eyes of almost anyone. And this happened to you, so you should use an example of this happening to the bil with a female friend of his SO and ask him if he could forgive that person for forcing something that can be deemed sexual assault on him.", "It's not your fault. Remember, he does NOT have the right to touch you, nor to make you feel like you're showing too much. You were NOT naked, and still he made you feel like you were. The drama is worth it if you think you'd feel more safe with him in jail, or having a restriction.", "Well, you have a witness, but I'd be very wary of your \"friends\" either way that try to get you to forgive him...", "Cutting him means that we are cutting also my fiance's family. I love his family and mil has supported me with my mother (has alzheimer) so I don't know how to cut only him out of life.", "I tried that but he said that he can forgive anyone but he cannot justify the action so I dropped conservation.", "So his family would rather cut off their own son than someone who sexually assulted you?\n\nWhat a nice bunch.", "So he can forgive someone but can't give a justification for it? That sounds like a bunch of bs because if you can forgive someone, that means you're capable of being able to justify their reasons for what they did.", "I haven't thought it that way. That opened my eyes that they rather pick his side than mine. Thank you, really. I guess I'm not using my energy for them anymore, more to my friend and siblings who helped me through a lot.", "I was saying exactly this to him but he didn't agree with me.", "Oh you\u2019re in a toxic relationship. Seems like everyone (but you) is okay with you getting assaulted\u2026 If Mark had assaulted your future MIL, would your bf still be silent?", "Well you shouldn't change your decision because others say you should. You can't justify reasonably why the friend did this other than because he thought he could and that isn't forgivable. Your bil is full of it because there's no reasonable way he could forgive some that did that to him.", "NTA. Your future husband needs to drop that guy as a friend. Fucking sexual predator when inebriated. Fuck forgiving that guy.", "NTA. I had a \"friend\" do almost the same thing to me while we were sharing a bed on a trip. I'm a lesbian and he was aware of this. I haven't spoken to him since we got back from the trip. \n\nYour fiance needs to do a better job of having your back; I'm shocked he still expects you to interact with his creepy friend.", "(I don\u2019t speak English) I read that your fianc\u00e9 has some things that could hurt himself that this friend knows, what about you blackmailing him because he SA\u2019d you and maybe your fianc\u00e9 could try to know more of him that could ruin his life too and of course you can tell everyone that he SA\u2019d you or use this as a factor to him not to tell anyone about what he knows of your fianc\u00e9", "NTA\n\nAlcohol is never an excuse. As simple as that.", "He needs to cut the friend loose. The excuse that the guy had dirt on your fiance is BS.", "NTA he assaulted you", "NTA but this story is so crazy to me. Did you not tell your fiance after he trapped you in the bathroom? Did your fiance confront him after he grabbed you? why not leave and go home?", "Fianc\u00e9 should man up and no longer be friends with that person. Even if he may get into a little trouble me from former friend, your family should come first.", "Op sweetie, first off I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you. This is not your fault. Second you are NTA, but your ex friend is. You don\u2019t have to forgive him. He\u2019s the one who should be begging for forgiveness through hell and storm. \n\nYou did the right thing by kicking him out your life.", "Nta", "He didn't apologise. My fiance has supported me and distanced from this friend. He is still contact with him because this friend knows stuff which would lead my partner into trouble and said that he doesn't trust this friend but keep his close just to keep this information unknown like \"keep friends close and enemies closer\" mindset.", "So he's choosing him over you?  Sounds like an ex-fiance.", "Are you sure you want to marry this guy?", "Forgiveness doesn't mean you have to let him back into your life. If my friend crashes my car accidentally, I can stay mad or forgive him but I am not letting him drive my car again. Forgive, not forget.", "Forgive and cut ties for your own mental and spiritual health. Forgiveness takes time and patience, but ask God to help you forgive as He forgives all of us.", "He literally violated the Ten Commandments, he doesn\u2019t deserve forgiveness, he only deserves that from his creator if he truely repents but not from you. Thou shall not covet thy neighbors wife.", "I don't think he is. Because that guy is still a friend. He needs to be gone permanently from your life", "Does your fiance not realize that at any moment Mark could get pissed at him and reveal this information anyways?\n\nAs much as it would suck, your fiance should just put the information out there  Then Mark will have no power over him (and you two can distance from him) and it may be liberating to not be carrying around a secret any more as well", "You nailed it. NTA op", "No he's choosing not to have his life ruined via blackmail while checking in with his gf making sure she's OK with it, and not allowing this man into their house. You ok?", "> while checking in with his gf making sure she's OK with it\n\nWhat is this referring to?", "Well if his family TRUELY supported you\u2026 they wouldn\u2019t be putting up with sexual assault\u2026\n\n He sexually assaulted you\u2026 alcohol is not an excuse", "Well from the post it seems that gf and the guy talked about it and she doesn't disagree. He also supporter her through this ordeal, keeping Mark at arms length and banning him from their house. This is sensible especially since since it seems like cutting off Mark will lead to a lot of drama and it's easier to just keep him at a distance.", "I didn't see anything about whether she disagrees.  Does not dumping him count as agreeing?", "Right, but I think if she had a problem with this she would mention it in the post where she detailed every other aspect of the situation which greatly upset her. She mentions they discussed it and nothing about disagreements or fights, so I really doubt this discussion ended with her not accepting this outcome as compromise."]}
