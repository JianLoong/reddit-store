She wasn\u2019t great at her job. But we also didn\u2019t pay her much. So we both were finding ourselves to be unhappy, even resentful after a while.\n\nWe had signed a contract telling her she would be with us for 1 year. The contract said that either party may break the agreement with 1 months pay or 1 months notice.\n\nDissatisfied with her care, we gave her a 2 month notice to end the childcare.\n\nOne day she declared suddenly she was unhappy and wanted to leave in 3 days at most.  She offered to work after 3 days at more than double the pay while living elsewhere.\n\nWe considered this a breach of contract and asked her to pay up if she leaves immediately. She refused. So we asked her to pack her bags and leave immediately.\n\nA few days later she asked to be paid for the 5 days or so that she had worked after her last pay cycle for which we hadn\u2019t paid.\n\nI refused because I think she should be paying us for not giving notice, as per what we interpret the contract to be. She\u2019s arguing that she was ready to work beyond the 3 days, just at a different rate which she thought was fair. \n\nThings ended on a very sour note and we are all very unhappy and angry. But I\u2019m sticking to my guns that I won\u2019t be paying for the 5 days because that\u2019s not what is in the contract.\n\nAITA for not paying her?\n\nEDIT: Based on the comments, I have decided to pay her. Only because it looks like my contract may not be written appropriately.\n\nA lot of you think I should have paid her for her time regardless of a contract. Do you realize what situation that would lead to? I would simply interview and finalize a different nanny while she works, and then drop a bomb on her that she\u2019s no longer required, and just pay her till that day. That would have been terribly inconvenient for her and very convenient for me.

She did those five days of childcare and you owe her for it. Any court of law would agree. If she wasn't great at taking care of your kids you shouldn't want her to stay those extra two months anyway. And if she was so unhappy why would you put your child's safety at risk and want her to stay? This is just silly...contract or no contract...pay the woman for her work. You are absolutely the AH for withholding her pay, especially after admitting you paid her poorly (and maybe that's why the care wasn't great - you get what you pay for). Take her to court if you think she owes you some sort of 'fee' for breaking a contract. Also, nice way of wording 'what we interpret the contract to be'. If the contract is vague that is on you. If you wanted a money penalty applied if she left prior to a month's notice that should be clearly stated in the contract. Nothing should be left up to interpretation when it comes to a contract.

It would strike me as odd if she were required to pay one months salary for quitting without adequate notice, although I could certainly see her having to pay something if she were in breach. Please also note that contracts typically require you to mitigate damages. In this case, that means making efforts to secure a new nanny. In theory, you might be entitled to the difference in cost between the old nanny and the new nanny for one month, but I doubt you would be entitled to a full months salary.

There\u2019s no way to prove that in court of course- it\u2019s not like I am gathering evidence all day that she\u2019s not engaging the baby and just on her phone. But I could have gone down that route.\n\nSo I feel I took the moral high ground by giving her 2 months notice. Honestly I offered her other options too, she just didn\u2019t want to take them. She wanted out too. Even 2 months was turning out to be too much for her, so after a few days she declared she\u2019s leaving in 3 days", "There are few things that get on my nerve more than employers that expect great performance for some low wage.

So again, you only get paid if you stick around.\n\nThese can sometimes be huge amounts.\n\nMy contract is the same thing in practice. The money promised in hand reduces if someone ends the contract earlier than expected.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why one is legally allowed and the other is wage theft.\n\nBut next time I could very well word my contract to instead pay lesser and then award a bonus if they stick around for a while.", "I hope word gets around how awful of an employer she is.

Wow yessssssss, What a kind gesture. \ud83d\ude44 You\u2019re definitely an asshole. Maybe you should just take care of your own kid and spare the next unsuspecting person you hire the trouble of having to deal with your evil, and possibly having to work for free when they decide they can\u2019t stand working for you before their year long prison sentence is up.

You can not have someone sign away their right to be compensated for work they did. \n2. When you provided her 2 months notice, it essentially meant that in 2 months she would not have a job anymore. The notice is to give her sufficient time to find a new job/living situation and you should not be surprised she started looking immediately. In a situation where you're working with a small employer and you're on good terms, it'd be nice to stay as long as they need you but you clearly admit that she was underpaid and not treated well. She had no obligation to spend the entire 2 months and you shouldn't have given her notice until you had new childcare lined up. \n\n\nYou could word your contract differently and it would be somethjng else (surprise).
