She can also add that you were so effusive in your thanks that you added a few words her dad would rather her not repeat\u2026and then give a knowing smile.", "Lol \ud83d\ude04! \n\nWhen my son was a baby, he hollered, \"Oh, shit!\" at the top of his voice in a crowded supermarket. It felt like everyone paused what they were doing, just to stare at us. I looked around me at all the frozen stares, and I said, \"When we get home, I'm going to kill his dad.\" \n\nIt was until some weeks later when he was watching our son by himself that he finally understood that his actions had consequences. My ex was screaming obscenities into the phone in front of our toddler son. When he finally hung up, our son turned to him and said \"He was a weal muvverfucker, huh, dad?\" The lesson stuck for at least a week.", "When my niece was two she dropped something on the floor and went \"aw, shit\". That is when my sister decided that they should start adjusting their language, haha.", "Thank you, I laughed so hard.  You made my day.", "I taught a toddler to say he\u2019s a tax benefit. I couldn\u2019t contain my laughter. The first time he said it in front of his grandmother, and she was so confused where he learned that", "> I learned a bad word and I'm going to use it! Yeah, almost everyone does it and thinks it makes them cool but it really just shows how unimaginative and inarticulate they are. Grow up already and possibly set a good example \n\nThey're just words. As long as they're used respectfully and in context, how exactly is it \"unimaginative and inarticulate\"?\n\nHonestly, it's a sign of immaturity to overly focus on \"bad words\" and to somehow think their status in some way makes the speaker less than yourself. I guarantee your use of language is equally as unimaginative--as is most basic spoken communication between friends and family. You're not giving a lecture, after all.", "I just looked over to my cat and said in baby talk, \"You're not a tax benefit, you're a drain on the economy!\"", "Yup when my son was 10 he broke his wrist in two spots and while on our way to the ER he asked if he could say something with a swear, tears running down his face, he looked so miserable and I'm like  \"sure\" and he proceeds to yell at the top of his lungs, \"This fucking hurts!!!\".", "NTA - your response to her had me in tears. She\u2019s so happy. We wanna see the print, I\u2019m filing for an Art Tax", "NTA\n\nShe's 16\nAnd it got repeated NOT for shock value but because she was so chuffed that your reaction was so off the cuff positive and big you didn't/couldn't even filter it.\n\nShe repeated it because it was the best fucking compliment she ever got.\n\u2764\ufe0f", "Ah yes. I remember going to high-school and never heared a curse word once. We all curtsied or bowed to our lovely professors and drank tea while discussing the stock market. \n\nSeriously though his kid knows what swearing is. Nta. He needs to loosen up a bit. You were excited and i bet that made the end of the year that much more special for her.", "She\u2019s 16. It won\u2019t kill her to hear (or even repeat, for that matter!) cuss words. \n\nIt sounds like your brother is just ashamed of having an autistic child and feels the need to shelter her for some reason. \n\nNTA", "It'll die off.  Any maybe your niece will have some comebacks to A Hs in her life.  lol  Sounds like you really enjoyed your gift :)", "NTA. Your brother is a bigger buzz kill than Buzz Killington", "NTA  I was all prepared to say yta, but she's 16, not 6.  I'm sure she has heard all of the words you used before.", "NTA its his job to teach his kid what words are appropriate and when. Not your job to shelter his kid. \n\nNot to mention you're never doing anyone a service by limiting their lexicon. Ignorance doesn't make words go away, it just leads to them being used incorrectly or inappropriately.", "NTA. usually when a poster prefaces their op with a comment about the other party's personality it's to excuse their own behavior, but in this case your brother truly sounds like a buzzkill lol. he even downplayed his daughter's art. you're a better person than i am, i might have argued on that point when confronted.", "NTA. It was a genuine reaction to an awesome, heartfelt gift made for you. There are far worse things your wonderful niece could be dealing with than someone explicitly praising her art. Teens cuss, oh well!", "NTA. She is 16 and knows swear words. Did your brother somehow successfully prevent her from ever hearing the word \"fucking,\" you introduced her to it, and now she can't stop? Nah, man. If she chooses not to censor your feedback when sharing the story with others, that's just her behavior. If brother doesn't want her to do that, he, the parent, should parent. \n\nYour sincere enthusiasm has obviously made her entire week, if not created a core memory of her growing up. And sometimes older family will swear, that's just life. IMO this was a delightful exception to generally discouraging your children from using vulgarity. What better time than when delighted by art?", "I understand where you're coming from, but let's all be aware. She has autism and we don't know to what level of autism she has it. It could be very serious", "Let's all keep I mind she does has autism :/", "Keep I mind she has autism.", "Reminds me that as a kid, I would say \"fuckles\" instead of \"freckles\" lmfao", "I had the same reaction. The only thing I could think of was if the niece was for some reason really distressed by swearing or certain curse words, but that wasn\u2019t the case, so what\u2019s the problem? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I was certainly sweating worse than this when I was 16, and so was every other kid I knew.", "especially because he prefaced the gift by calling it weird. Dude just hates his kid and is still a chronic stick in the mud. He hates fun, joy, and probably the sensation of happiness.", "They're just words lol don't give words that kind of power. Plus, she's 16, not 6.", "Hahahaha, my 6yo: \"So fuck is a swear word, isn't it?\" \n\nHis dad was on the verge of scolding him when I calmly responded that, \"Yes it is, what does that mean?\"\n\n\"Okay, sorry mom. I won't say it in front of you again...\" Dad couldn't help his smirk at the qualified response. Love the little brat to pieces of course.", "Mine did the same, I'm expecting her Lil sis will too \ud83d\ude05\n\nATM my 8yo has taken to saying f-word n s-word... literally. Not actual swearing saying S Word etc \ud83e\udd23\n\nBorderline legalese when she's scolded. \"It's not swearing! Lots of words start with F\"", "My sister used to pronounce \u201csoccer ball\u201d as \u201cfucker ball\u201d when she was a toddler lol.", "This is fantastic. \ud83d\ude02 I just read this to my husband, who is now in stitches.", "Lol, when my youngest was around that age, our TV broke. She came into me \"TV's fucked Mum\". Could not get mad at that!", "She's probably read worse on the door of a bathroom stall", "I wound up with a pretty nasty black eye as a young kid (3/4) from running face-first into a tree and my parents apparently taught me to say \u201cyou should see the other guy!\u201d when adults commented on the shiner.", "Mine has been saying \"oh sassafras\" \ud83d\ude02 \n\nHer little sister will absolutely never ask, she was born with zero fucks to give and at 3 she has not gained any.", "Freeloader!\n\nJust like my dogs. They don't earn shit, they bring me absolutely no monetary benefits or income of any kind, just expenses. AND they shed like crazy (and I hate vacuuming). Unfortunately for my bank account, I absolutely adore them and am a total sucker for a furry face, so here they will remain.", "Aww poor wee guy!! \n\nImo, swearing is all about knowing when it\u2019s appropriate. In the middle of church? No. On the way to the ER after you\u2019ve broken your wrist in two places? Yes. As long as the setting is appropriate and the language used is proportional to the situation, my future kid can swear with no shame.", "I don't mind the swearing, as long as it's not AT someone. You should hear me when I play Super Mario :) all in all he's a pretty respectful little dude (13 now) so usually if a curse word slips out I don't make too big of deal.", "Oh yes swearing AT someone is never okay, like I don\u2019t do that as an adult either, because it\u2019s really nasty and absolutely crosses a line. But yelling at Mario Kart (within reason) or when you\u2019ve hurt yourself or whatever, fine, who cares.", "I broke my thumb in elementary school. Doctor was a buddy's dad, and even though I wasn't close to him, when he was resetting my thumb all you heard me yell as \"God damnit Michael that fucking hurts!\". Still one of my parents favorite stories to tell. But I'd still consider that under the hurt segment, and it wasn't directed AT him, but it did include him in it. There are definitely very different situations where stuff can be used/said.", "Exactly lol."]}
