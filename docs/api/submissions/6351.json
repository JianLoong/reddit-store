Yes watch your language for fuck's sake but your pure and sincere enthusiasm more than makes up for your bad language. Sometimes autistic kids struggle with reading emotion so your really enthusiastic, swear word filled response may have actually been helpful. She could easily tell you were thrilled. Is there anything better than that???\n\nWorth it in my opinion because you're probably going to get more cool artwork.", "If she were 6, I'd say watch your mouth.

This should not be news to her dad or anyone for that matter.", "NTA - Yeah the swearing was a bit excessive and unnecessary, but I am glad you made your niece's day. Your brother needs to understand that she is 16, not 6, and you can bet your bottom dollar that she has heard quite some colourful language at school.", "She's 16, not 6.

Just a super cool uncle whose buzzkill brother is probably a bit jealous of. \n\nYou appreciated his daughter's artwork, demonstrated your enthusiasm for her gift in a wonderfully colourful way and undoubtedly made her proud of herself. It seems he struggles to connect with her so maybe that's part of his response. But that is a him problem. He should be thrilled that you genuinely loved his daughter's gift and value her skills.

Definitely not the AH bro.  thats awesome.    talk you into showing us the pic??", "NTA at 16 she's heard worse.

You loved her art so much you completely forgot your filter! I'd call that a win!\n\nShe's 16, so unless your brother has been raising her to be super sheltered she's heard those words before.
