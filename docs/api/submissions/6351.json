Yes watch your language for fuck's sake but your pure and sincere enthusiasm more than makes up for your bad language. Sometimes autistic kids struggle with reading emotion so your really enthusiastic, swear word filled response may have actually been helpful. She could easily tell you were thrilled. Is there anything better than that???\n\nWorth it in my opinion because you're probably going to get more cool artwork.", "If she were 6, I'd say watch your mouth. At 16, I guarantee she's heard worse at school.\n\nNTA", "NTA - she's 16 and Autistic not a 6 year old nun. As a former (very long time ago) 16 year old Autistic girl I assure you I said those words and probably even said them when I shouldn't have and I've made it to 44 without combusting. Words are words.\n\nEdit to add: I'd have loved I someone appreciated anything I've done or made that much.", "NTA. She\u2019s 16, not 6. It seems like you made her day. And her dad sucks.", "NTA. It's pretty sad what your brother was saying about her art before you saw it.", "NTA- the way you expressed your emotions probably meant the world to her. And she is 16. Most 16 year olds cuss. This should not be news to her dad or anyone for that matter.", "NTA - Yeah the swearing was a bit excessive and unnecessary, but I am glad you made your niece's day. Your brother needs to understand that she is 16, not 6, and you can bet your bottom dollar that she has heard quite some colourful language at school.", "She's 16, not 6. None of the cussing you did can't be heard on tv/movie on any given day.\n\nYour reaction was fucking awesome and made her day. She loved it so much, she repeated to people and that's priceless. \n\nNTA", "NTA - you made her day (if not her whole year and it\u2019s only early January)", "NTA. \n\nYour niece made you something incredible, and she deserved a strong form of praise lol\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like your brother likes that she\u2019s into art with the way he described her art as \u201creally darn weird\u201d and then getting upset when you had a positive reaction about it. She put so much work into this, and he\u2019s just bringing her down.", "NTA. I don't care how old you are, pure joy shines through. She would have immediately known that you loved it and giving a gift that someone genuinely loves is a wonderful feeling. Your brother should be able to see that through his prudish winces", "NTA", "NTA. This is a way better reaction than the aunt who laughed at her nieces gift.", "NTA. Clearly your string of curse words impacted her in a really positive way!", "I got nothing but you sound like such a chad for a 40 year old.", "YTA logically. But in reality you are just really fucking rad. \n\nThat was fucking awesome. She will never forget how happy that made you! And builds serious confidence!\n\nGood fucking job.", "NTA, your brother is a buzzkill, as you said.  You made the kid happy!  Personally, I would reiterate to her how much you like the drawing, but that it was inappropriate for you to use salty language.  But keep encouraging her!!  It sounds like she\u2019s talented and could use the encouragement!  Don\u2019t worry about your brother, he\u2019ll get over it.", "NTA. I've heard worse stuff come out of the mouths of 8yros.   \nAlso though there are many other ways to express yourself without dropping the F-bomb multiple times. In the future try to stop before you get there!", "YTA\n\nYour niece is a child. Please follow her father\u2019s preferences regarding language regardless of how you would normally react to something", "YTA.  There were other ways to express your delight that wouldn't offend anyone when mimiced.", "YTA. \n\nThere are excited utterances and then there's this. I'm guessing your niece's habit of repeating verbatim isn't new, and is something you were aware of.\n\nAnd your post makes it clear that you have almost no regard for your brother as a human,  let alone as a parent.\n\nI'll bet you a nickel you went overboard on purpose.", "\"So anyway I am a bonafide Disney adult.\"\n\nYTA", "YTA and need to grow up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why does this make her the AH?", "It means randomz is fifteen years old and thinks OP is far to old to be cool.", "I think you could have said the same but without the swear words and achieved the same.  It's the tone that makes it patronizing, not the words.", "If she's super perceptive then she'd know you were pleased by your expression and tone. It's unpopular, but YTA. If you can't express yourself without resorting to foul language, get a Thesaurus. That's kid stuff-ooh, I learned a **bad word** and I'm going to use it!

Just a super cool uncle whose buzzkill brother is probably a bit jealous of. \n\nYou appreciated his daughter's artwork, demonstrated your enthusiasm for her gift in a wonderfully colourful way and undoubtedly made her proud of herself. It seems he struggles to connect with her so maybe that's part of his response. But that is a him problem. He should be thrilled that you genuinely loved his daughter's gift and value her skills. He's clearly lacking in emotional intelligence so I wouldn't worry too much about it. You probably made her life, let alone her day, by praising her so effusively. Awesome!", "She is 16.

Lol\n\nWe can tell when something is *off* but that doesnt mean we can always tell what it is, or if it's true. Perceptive enough to notice the change, but unable to tell what that change was."]}
