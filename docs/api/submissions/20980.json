This is creepy and beyond AITA material..", "It's beyond weird that your sisters husband would give you jewelry.  That alone would make me uncomfortable enough to return it. Not to mention that he did  it without your sisters permission,  with joint money they can't afford to spend?!?  Give it back and watch our for this dude. He clearly has a thing for you.", "Technically you\u2019re not the AH here, but you might want to do your sis a solid and return it. Sounds like there\u2019s more going on between her and her husband and an expensive bracelet isn\u2019t an appropriate gift for them to give right now.", "I\u2019m sure you realize how much Tiffany products cost and it\u2019s jewelry. It\u2019s a rather inappropriate gift and who can even guess what the subtext is. Whichever way you go is not going to help your sister\u2019s marriage but that part is on them not you.  You have to decide what is best for your relationship with your sister. If you keep the bracelet you will damage your relationship with your sister but, hey, you\u2019ll have a great piece of jewelry!  I recommend giving it back to your brother in law personally and not your sister.  Tell him it\u2019s too valuable, jewelry, and inappropriate from a brother in law. I\u2019m going to say NTA yet because you did ask and you still have time to make it right.", "The AH here is your BIL for gifting you an expensive gift and not telling his wife. Personally, I would return it.", "I'm curious why BIL would give OP such an expensive gift...  especially without telling his wife.  Is there something more going on that we Redditors need to know about?  Is he interested in OP?", "brother in law wants to dick you down", "Why would you want to keep a suspiciously expensive gift that's obviously from your BIL and not your sister, while knowing that he bought it behind her back, from their shared money? Also knowing that they aren't rich? That's  why YTA to me.", "ESH.\n\nYour BIL gifting you expensive jewelry without his wife's knowledge is inappropriate and creepy.\n\nAnd keeping it when your stepsister has told you they need the money is immature and selfish. I misread the first time and thought you were 16 - 26 is old enough to know better.", "ESH. Your BIL for getting such a weirdly extravagant gift without checking in with his wife, and you for accepting a weirdly extravagant gift when it was clear his wife was not comfortable. No way I\u2019m accepting anything like that without making sure it wasn\u2019t an accident or something.", "YTA,\n\nYes she didn\u2019t give it to you the BIL did, but he used money from their SHARED income, without her permission so she definitely has a say in it. Just return it and avoid unnecessary drama. Definitely sounds like their marriage is on the rocks.", "Eh, NTA but Joe sure is. Wtf is up with him. But also \"she wasn't even the one that gave it to me\" and \"I presumed they'd both bought the gift,\" pick your side mate, your contradicting yourself. You have to realize that if this was taken out of their shared income then yes, she did actually \"buy\" it too. Your not an AH for it, but just give the bracelet back and stay out of this bullshit, it's not at all worth it. This is a fight between your stepsister and her husband, give it back and don't get involved.", "Not sure this will be popular but I'm saying YTA. Yeah, it was a gift. Sure. But you know your sister is in a dire financial situation, you know BIL made an objectively stupid financial decision that impacts her, and you're okay with that because you like a piece of jewelry that has purely aesthetic, superficial meaning and purpose. My conscience would absolutely not let me keep that bracelet.", "NTA, but I would return it.", "ESH he shouldn't have spent money on you they don't have.  Feels inappropriate and weird to me\n\nYou should give it back because you know they can't afford it.\n\nYour sister should have talked to her husband instead of you", "NTA  but I would return it ASAP and limit contact with BIL. Something bigger than you is going on between them and you don't want to get in the middle. \n\nAs much as I enjoy watching drama,  I hate being in the middle of the drama. A man buying jewelry for another woman without his wife's knowledge is DRAMA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And she essentially did gift it to you if Joe took money out of their shared account.\n\nIt kind of feels like your stepsister might have a bigger issue though. I find it odd that Joe would gift you an expensive bracelet, which for them apparently is a substantial amount of their shared money. Has Joe ever given an impression he might like you more then as just a sister in law? Or does he give expensive gifts to everyone?", "NTA - But I would suggest you return it to them anyway. There are clearly some issues in their marriage and they have put you in the middle of it. Remove yourself from the situation by returning the bracelet and tell them to keep you out of their issues in the future.", "Nta, if anything your bil is but I would recommend still returning the bracelet since it sounds like it did involve her money and she wasn't ok with the purchase", "NTA\n\nPeople shouldn't gift gifts they cant afford. This is a marital issue and you should not get involved. Explain that while you appreciate everything they are saying, say that you would be more comfortable if ***both*** of them asked for the gift back. (I assume it was from them both)\n\nIts a bit weird returning a gift to the spouse of the person who gave you it. Almost feels as if they are trying to get it returned without SO knowing which is a very odd behaviour.", "NTA personally I would return it, BUT I would return it directly to BIL and tell him stepsister said he wanted it back.\n\nas far as you know BIL knows nothing about returning the gift, maybe stepsister wants to return it and keep the cash for herself and hope that you will be too embarrassed to ever mention it", "NTA.\n\nIt would be insulting to Joe if you returned the gift. If it was indeed an overreach on his part, he has to man up and tell you, otherwise Happy Birthday!", "A gift is a gift, this is a matter the stepsis and BIL need to sort out. NTA", "NTA. You\u2019re under no obligation return the bracelet. It was a gift, full stop.\n\nRealistically, what I would do is contact Joe directly and ask if he needs the bracelet back. From the info in the post it sounds like he was trying to do something nice with the gift and is probably now embarrassed at the outcome. Either due to Avery\u2019s awful gift etiquette, or this public show that he\u2019s not successful enough to afford it (whether true or not). Talking to him on the side instead of openly dogging him like Avery is doing might get you closer to the truth. If he still says keep it, tell Avery to pound sand by sending Joe (and only Joe) a nice thank you card.", "Ouff this is a tough one. Gift givers shouldn't \\*normally\\* have any business asking for their gifts back. That being said, however, the bracelet was bought from their shared income, without Avery's knowledge or agreement. \n\nYou can sure refuse to give it up, but ask yourself if it's worth the three-way rift that's gonna cause and if you're okay with that.", "NTA you were gifted something you didn\u2019t ask for. It makes me wonder though, if they share their income how didn\u2019t stepsister notice a big purchase? Is your BIL the type to overspend and be financially irresponsible? It sounds like stepsister is trying to be sneaky and asking you to return it behind her husbands back which is a red flag. Could he have purchased it second hand or on sale? Your stepsister is putting you in the middle of whatever marriage issues they\u2019re going through. It\u2019s bizarre that he bought you a Tiffany\u2019s bracelet if they can\u2019t afford an item like that. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d return it unless BIL said they need the money back. Stepsister may be jealous you got a big gift if he isn\u2019t gifting her similar items, but to ask you to return it and give her the money is weird as hell (this whole thing is odd imo)", "Jewelry is one of those gifts in which a) you buy it for yourself or b) your *partner* give to you. Your BIL giving jewelry to you is weird already, and a Tiffany? Having to dip into jointed income to buy it? *Without your sister knowing?* I don't even know why you're hesitating here. He did it either to spite your sister or/and because he has a thing for you.  \n  \nYTA for not returning it (very small one), but I get it wanting to keep such an expensive gift. But whatever comes from such a gift is not worth it.", "Tell us more about your relationship with her husband. What are you purposely leaving out?", "Technically nta, but I think give it back", "INFO do you not find it strange that your BIL, who is not well off, bought you a very expensive gift? And your sister is telling you that they cannot afford it and he did it without asking her. Why do you want to keep it when the situation is weird.\n\nIt's not weird that your BIL got you a gift or even that it's jewelry. It's weird because they cannot afford the gift and your sister didn't know he spent so much money on someone else instead of prioritizing their wellbeing as a couple?", "If you don't return it, YTA given the circumstances around the bracelet. Also, I would pull back from that whole situation. Him even buying you that bracelet is weird imo.", "I don't find gifting jewelry to your SIL inherently suspect, but prioritizing that over your wife is definitely throwing flags. Either he has a thing for OP, or he feels like his wife doesn't appreciate gifts of jewelry, and is doing this out of spite. Either way, OP should steer clear of this mess.", "Agreed OP is not AH. But I feel the sister is doing this in a very mischievous way and I'm not convinced its good intentions through and through.", "This. OP said \u201cI thanked them both\u201d and one of them is asking for it back. Don\u2019t be the greedy one, I get it\u2019s from Tiffany\u2019s and what not, but don\u2019t let a piece of diamond destroy your relationship with your family.", "Okay, but surely that makes him the AH. She shouldn't give it back but not doing so wouldn't make her the AH. \n\n\nThere's probably a lot more to this", "Then why buy the gift in the first place?", "Why is she the AH??? She accepted a gift. It\u2019s their problem in their marriage if one spouse is buying beyond their means and giving gifts they cannot afford. It might be courteous to rerun it but I fail to see how OP is the AH for accepting a gift someone gave her", "I agree with your take. They seem to be having problems in their marriage and OP got enmeshed in it.", ">It would be insulting to Joe if you returned the gift\n\nIs not insulting Joe the highest priority here?", "I buy and receive jewelry from friends and family often. However, nothing as extravagant as Tiffany.", "Gifting jewelry in general? Not bad. Gifting very expensive jewelry that\u2019s clearly super expensive for you? Absolutely weird and suspect. I would feel uncomfortable if any male friend gave me something that expensive", "Something definitely off. FWIW I would not want to be involved so I would just return it.", "Good question. Why would you buy an expensive piece of jewelry for your wife's sister, without consulting your wife?", "I don't think Op is an AH here. But willingly knowing someones husband gave you something that'll put them in debt and knowing it'll cost you nothing to just give it back yet refusing to would absolutely be AH behavior. It being \"a gift\" doesn't suddenly absolve you of any blame, in fact thinking it does makes you a bigger AH. I just don't think that's what's happening in this story.", "Interesting point of view honestly. I'd be cautious returning it to them without SO knowing.", "The immediate answer that comes to my mind is brownie points with the wife\u2019s family but the more outlandish theory is what Reddit jumps to.", "If she's worried about that, send a text letter her know that she'll return it to Joe. Give it back to Joe directly with an explanation on what happened. But stepsisters behavior sounds more like she's pissed her husband spent a huge amount of their combined money without consulting her and is now forcing her to be the bad guy in getting it back."]}
