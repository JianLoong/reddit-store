If you keep the bracelet you will damage your relationship with your sister but, hey, you\u2019ll have a great piece of jewelry!

And she essentially did gift it to you if Joe took money out of their shared account.\n\nIt kind of feels like your stepsister might have a bigger issue though. I find it odd that Joe would gift you an expensive bracelet, which for them apparently is a substantial amount of their shared money. Has Joe ever given an impression he might like you more then as just a sister in law? Or does he give expensive gifts to everyone?", "NTA - But I would suggest you return it to them anyway. There are clearly some issues in their marriage and they have put you in the middle of it. Remove yourself from the situation by returning the bracelet and tell them to keep you out of their issues in the future.", "Nta, if anything your bil is but I would recommend still returning the bracelet since it sounds like it did involve her money and she wasn't ok with the purchase", "NTA\n\nPeople shouldn't gift gifts they cant afford. This is a marital issue and you should not get involved. Explain that while you appreciate everything they are saying, say that you would be more comfortable if ***both*** of them asked for the gift back. (I assume it was from them both)\n\nIts a bit weird returning a gift to the spouse of the person who gave you it. Almost feels as if they are trying to get it returned without SO knowing which is a very odd behaviour.", "NTA personally I would return it, BUT I would return it directly to BIL and tell him stepsister said he wanted it back.\n\nas far as you know BIL knows nothing about returning the gift, maybe stepsister wants to return it and keep the cash for herself and hope that you will be too embarrassed to ever mention it", "NTA.\n\nIt would be insulting to Joe if you returned the gift. If it was indeed an overreach on his part, he has to man up and tell you, otherwise Happy Birthday!", "A gift is a gift, this is a matter the stepsis and BIL need to sort out. NTA", "NTA. You\u2019re under no obligation return the bracelet. It was a gift, full stop.\n\nRealistically, what I would do is contact Joe directly and ask if he needs the bracelet back. From the info in the post it sounds like he was trying to do something nice with the gift and is probably now embarrassed at the outcome. Either due to Avery\u2019s awful gift etiquette, or this public show that he\u2019s not successful enough to afford it (whether true or not). Talking to him on the side instead of openly dogging him like Avery is doing might get you closer to the truth. If he still says keep it, tell Avery to pound sand by sending Joe (and only Joe) a nice thank you card.", "Ouff this is a tough one. Gift givers shouldn't \\*normally\\* have any business asking for their gifts back. That being said, however, the bracelet was bought from their shared income, without Avery's knowledge or agreement. \n\nYou can sure refuse to give it up, but ask yourself if it's worth the three-way rift that's gonna cause and if you're okay with that.", "NTA you were gifted something you didn\u2019t ask for. It makes me wonder though, if they share their income how didn\u2019t stepsister notice a big purchase? Is your BIL the type to overspend and be financially irresponsible? It sounds like stepsister is trying to be sneaky and asking you to return it behind her husbands back which is a red flag. Could he have purchased it second hand or on sale? Your stepsister is putting you in the middle of whatever marriage issues they\u2019re going through. It\u2019s bizarre that he bought you a Tiffany\u2019s bracelet if they can\u2019t afford an item like that. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d return it unless BIL said they need the money back. Stepsister may be jealous you got a big gift if he isn\u2019t gifting her similar items, but to ask you to return it and give her the money is weird as hell (this whole thing is odd imo)", "Jewelry is one of those gifts in which a) you buy it for yourself or b) your *partner* give to you. Your BIL giving jewelry to you is weird already, and a Tiffany? Having to dip into jointed income to buy it? *Without your sister knowing?* I don't even know why you're hesitating here. He did it either to spite your sister or/and because he has a thing for you.  \n  \nYTA for not returning it (very small one), but I get it wanting to keep such an expensive gift. But whatever comes from such a gift is not worth it.", "Tell us more about your relationship with her husband. What are you purposely leaving out?", "Technically nta, but I think give it back", "INFO do you not find it strange that your BIL, who is not well off, bought you a very expensive gift? And your sister is telling you that they cannot afford it and he did it without asking her. Why do you want to keep it when the situation is weird.\n\nIt's not weird that your BIL got you a gift or even that it's jewelry. It's weird because they cannot afford the gift and your sister didn't know he spent so much money on someone else instead of prioritizing their wellbeing as a couple?", "If you don't return it, YTA given the circumstances around the bracelet. Also, I would pull back from that whole situation. Him even buying you that bracelet is weird imo.", "I don't find gifting jewelry to your SIL inherently suspect, but prioritizing that over your wife is definitely throwing flags. Either he has a thing for OP, or he feels like his wife doesn't appreciate gifts of jewelry, and is doing this out of spite. Either way, OP should steer clear of this mess.", "Agreed OP is not AH. But I feel the sister is doing this in a very mischievous way and I'm not convinced its good intentions through and through.", "This. OP said \u201cI thanked them both\u201d and one of them is asking for it back. Don\u2019t be the greedy one, I get it\u2019s from Tiffany\u2019s and what not, but don\u2019t let a piece of diamond destroy your relationship with your family.", "Okay, but surely that makes him the AH. She shouldn't give it back but not doing so wouldn't make her the AH. \n\n\nThere's probably a lot more to this", "Then why buy the gift in the first place?", "Why is she the AH??? She accepted a gift. It\u2019s their problem in their marriage if one spouse is buying beyond their means and giving gifts they cannot afford. It might be courteous to rerun it but I fail to see how OP is the AH for accepting a gift someone gave her", "I agree with your take. They seem to be having problems in their marriage and OP got enmeshed in it.", ">It would be insulting to Joe if you returned the gift\n\nIs not insulting Joe the highest priority here?", "I buy and receive jewelry from friends and family often. However, nothing as extravagant as Tiffany.", "Gifting jewelry in general? Not bad. Gifting very expensive jewelry that\u2019s clearly super expensive for you? Absolutely weird and suspect. I would feel uncomfortable if any male friend gave me something that expensive", "Something definitely off. FWIW I would not want to be involved so I would just return it.", "Good question. Why would you buy an expensive piece of jewelry for your wife's sister, without consulting your wife?", "I don't think Op is an AH here. But willingly knowing someones husband gave you something that'll put them in debt and knowing it'll cost you nothing to just give it back yet refusing to would absolutely be AH behavior. It being \"a gift\" doesn't suddenly absolve you of any blame, in fact thinking it does makes you a bigger AH. I just don't think that's what's happening in this story.", "Interesting point of view honestly. I'd be cautious returning it to them without SO knowing.", "The immediate answer that comes to my mind is brownie points with the wife\u2019s family but the more outlandish theory is what Reddit jumps to.", "If she's worried about that, send a text letter her know that she'll return it to Joe. Give it back to Joe directly with an explanation on what happened. But stepsisters behavior sounds more like she's pissed her husband spent a huge amount of their combined money without consulting her and is now forcing her to be the bad guy in getting it back.", "YTA. Yes you're not \"technically obligated\" to return a gift but come on. A bracelet doesn't impact your life, it was taken out of their joint money without her consent. It's not like this is something that makes a big difference to your life, and it's not like she *knowingly* gave a gift just to take it back later.\n\n\nDo her the favour this time but warn her this is inconvenient for you and to please not drag you in in the future.\n\n\nIgnoring her request is just cold.", "A Tiffany bracelet out of the blue from your brother in law? Without her knowledge in advance? I would have it returned as as soon as I could. Tell them it\u2019s wonderful but they truly shouldn\u2019t have done it.", "YTA.  This bracelet will cost you your relationship with your sister.  Everyone who finds out about why your sister suddenly hates will make negative assumptions (like you're sleeping with BIL).  I mean, if you're okay with the social implications that keeping this bracelet will carry, by all means, but personally I would like to avoid the optics of looking like I'm sleeping with my BIL.", "No judgment because this is messed up. You SHOULD return the bracelet and take yourself out of this mess.", "Your BIL is interested in you, and you don\u2019t seem to care about how that affects your stepsister. Which makes YTA, along with your BIL. \n\nIt is not common to gift someone jewelry from Tiffany\u2019s unless you have a bit of money, and you have told us they don\u2019t. And expensive jewelry is usually gifted from a romantic partner or to children for milestones (again, unless you are wealthy). Add to that your stepsister\u2019s reaction and follow up call, and it\u2019s obvious your BIL is *trying to impress you*. Gross. Send it back and let him know how inappropriate his gift was. And distance yourself from the situation.", "YTA, to some degree. You accepted a gift you thought was from both of them, that's fine. When you find out she didn't know, it's a more creepy/weird gift just from him that makes her uncomfortable then it's absolutely right to give it back.\n\nI think maybe the most likely explanation is BIL bought something for someone he's having an affair with, wife found box and BIL lied and said it was a gift for you and went through with giving it to you. Wife thought okay it's some cheap jewellery for a gift not some statement present from Tiffany's and now she's uncomfortable with it, and really she should be.", "What do you want more, a weirdly gifted bracelet or whatever fallout is gonna happen from keeping it? Whether you think it's fair to keep it as a gift isn't going to remove how anyone feels about it. That crap is gonna blow up so removing yourself from any nonsense from the jump is a smart play.\n\nMy 2c, return it and be aware cuz this is all weird.", "ESH\n\nYou - potentially keeping a trinket that is just going to make their marital spat worse and prolonged. I understand how you feel though.\n\nYour brother in law - for not clearing a $500-$1000 purchase with his wife before spending from their joint account. Assuming that's what he did. My wife and I have a house account and our own personal accounts that we don't challenge each other as to how it's spent even frivolously. \n\nYour sister - awkwardly making you fix this by returning it and giving her the money. Having a gift taken out of your hands feels like shit. \n\nIf this happened to me and my wife bought someone in my family something really expensive, I'd talk to her in private and ask that she contribute X amount more to the joint account to account for this gift.\n\nIn your case I would just take it back, give her the money, tell your brother in law thank you and it was very thoughtful but you can't accept it. \nTell your sister in private that this is the first and last time you're going to do something like this for her,  and suggest a rule that gifts be under $50 or something.\n\nSuper awkward situation.", "NTA. \n\nI see two possible scenarios:\n\n1. BIL is creeping on OP.\n2. Sister wants cash without telling BIL.\n\nEither is not good. OP can probably decide which one is correct for their situation.\n\nGet together with BIL and Sis. Tell BIL that as much as you appreciate the thoughtful gift, you have decided it is much to expensive and you don't feel right accepting it. Return it. Best way I see to navigate these difficult waters.", "It\u2019s inappropriate. You should give it back into your sister. He has a thing for you and you need to take a step back and allow her to figure out her marriage.", "The way I was raised,  men don't give expensive jewelry to women that they're not interested in romantically.   Your BIL has dragged you into THEIR marital problems (which is a crappy thing to do) by giving you what (IMHO) is an inappropriate gift. \n\nI think you should give it back to Joe with Avery present.  That will send a clear message to both of them that you have no designs on Joe (which Avery may be wondering about).   And while it won't resolve THEIR problems, it neatly extracts you from them.\n\nYWBTA if you don't give it back.  And you're also setting yourself up to be involved in their drama for a long time.", "ESH, is keeping the bracelet worth the drama and strain on your relationship with your sister? I can't imagine it is.\n\nThe two of them very clearly need to have a conversation about why this happened (whether he's wrong for buying it or she's wrong for wanting it back or some combination of both, I can't say as I don't know the ins and outs of the relationships involved here). It's obviously not your job to facilitate such a discussion, but it may be a benefit to you to be a part of it to get more information about the situation firsthand or even just to express to them both at the same time that you don't appreciate being dragged into weird drama like this.\n\nEDIT: changed my vote from N T A to E S H as realistically I think each of you is as much in the wrong as the others", "That is a very odd gift from your BIL.

Return it, it looks sus and skanky as hell especially knowing that is a large part of their income.  Keep your distance from Joe.", "YTA if you don't return it.\n\nFirst of all, now that you know it wasn't a 'shared' gift that your sister had any input on, don't you feel a bit creepy about your BIL spending so much money on you? Have you ever seen him spend that kind of money on your sister?? Second, you know they aren't well off. Third, your sister has told you that they can't afford it and she needs to return it. \n\nYour sister definitely has a husband problem, but she's telling you that this is a problem in her finances and household.

Your potentially getting involved in your sister marriage which is an asshole thing to do, and could cause a rift in your family long term, and it\u2019s kinda stolen goods.

If BIL stole a car and gave it to you, then the owner asked for it back, would you argue it\u2019s still your car?", "Honestly, finding out the gift wasn\u2019t from my sister would make me not want to keep it. It\u2019s freaking creepy. Low key, sounds like her husband is in love with you. Who buys their SIL Tiffany\u2019s jewelry?

Something seems very off and you need to get this out in the open to figure it out", "Unpopular opinion and will probably get downvoted, but NTA. \n\nYou're absolutely NOT an AH for receiving a birthday gift. If your BIL bought the bracelet as a gift for you from his and his wife's shared income without her knowledge, that's not your problem, and absolutely not your fault. That's something between them inside their marriage. You played no part in it. You didn't ask for it, so I don't understand why many people are saying that you're the AH. \n\nI understand your sister might have been shocked if she truly didn't know about it, but I also think it's wrong from her to ask for a gift back and expect you to give it back. I think she should focus on figuring things out between her and her husband, not on a gift. That's the least of her problems if what you're saying is true.", "YTA but your BiL is a bigger one - at best, your BiL was show-boating that he could give you expensive presents to impress you and the rest of the family.

He may have gifted it to you but the money that paid for it was not his to use without talking through with his wife. \n\nYou can keep it knowing it is causing issue in their marriage and that they might be going without household essentials so you can have something pretty on your wrist.

My husband had no bank account when we got married, and I paid bills by check (eons ago). He assumed that what the ATM said the balance was showing was actually how much we had. A few bounced checks later and I set him straight. Just give the gift back, you never know how close someone is to financial insolvency; better she see if she can get the money back for their account.

Sure I was the one who gifted it but you\u2019re actually the one on the hook for it. \n\nThe sister should give it back", "Oof yeah, and I'm just imagining how embarrassing and humiliating for the stepsister it must have been to have to actually have to explain the circumstance to OP and ask for it back. (OP didn't say her sister was prone to rudeness or drama against her, so I'm assuming the sister has the baseline amount of social grace).   \n\nAnd it's not like this is an insulin pump or replacement tires for her car. It's pure luxury and the only reason to keep it is it's expensive and she likes it. And she knows her stepsister's not well off, but too bad if she can't pay the bills or whatever because of this, OP needs to keep it because of an emergency... the emergency is she looks really good in Tiffany bracelets.", "Not asking his wife to use their shared money for it is inappropriate though. Especially if they aren\u2019t well off", "Jewelry is on the short list of inappropriate gifts It's polite to turn down.  I mean there are a few exceptions, parents/grandparents aunts uncles. brides sometimes give jewelry as a thank you gifts to the bridesmaids. Watches for graduation/retirement. Kids can buy jewelry for their parents too.  themed jewelry for friends. A dozen red roses on Kwim \n\n  But \"used a big chunk of shared income come without permission\" is theft too not Just the romantic implication of expensive jewelry.", "No one has ever bought me Tiffany except for my husband", "My mothers bought me a beautiful Tiffany bracelet for my 35th birthday, I\u2019ve worn it every day since (I\u2019m 43 now). Of course I\u2019ve also hinted damn near every year since that the matching necklace would be a great, but no luck yet lol.", "I currently have earrings and a necklace. He\u2019s asked for me to send him wedding ring pics I like from Tiffany", "She\u2019s profiting from the guy\u2019s asshole move\u2026.\n\nAnd she\u2019s aware of the situation. He never had the right to give it to her so her returning it is returning things to the way it should be. She has no legal obligation to return it but this isn\u2019t about what\u2019s legal or not"]}
