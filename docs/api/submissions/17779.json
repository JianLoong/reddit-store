My mother recently suffered a heart attack that left her bed ridden and I have been her main caregiver. My older brother and his partner moved in to help take care of her but do so minimally and mainly just make more of a mess for me to clean up. \n\nTo cut to the chase, my mom is emotionally abusive and manipulative. She'll threaten to call the cops on me for \"elder abuse\" over messes my brother made, yell at me about how I \"haven't cleaned anything or taken any responsibility in months\" if I need to rest, she's threatened to end her life over me getting frustrated (calling the cops or therapists won't do anything, I've been down this road before), and has recently been guilt tripping me about \"ruining her last holidays\" because I've gone LC with a family member who threatened me with physical harm.\n\nWe don't know if my mom will pass away soon or not, her health is horrible but she's made recoveries before. And since someone will ask, yes I know for certain she's not faking it. My brother has become less emotionally abusive to me  recently but will become threatening if I stand up to our mom in his presence. He's also disgusting to live with and has screamed and thrown stuff over me cooking \"fake meat\" when I made myself a Japanese dish with tofu. He's also irresponsible with weapons and I can't mention it without my family blowing up over \"mUh FreEdOms\" and the \"2nd amendment\". We're currently on the cusp of eviction because of \"his freedoms\". He believes that all means he can park is multiple broke down vehicles in our driveway despite it being against our lease and he leaves the yard a wreck. Until recently he bullied me for all the aspects of my autism but has since lessened since it became an official diagnosis. \n\nMy partner and I have been together for almost 5 years. He's offered for me to move to his state with him. I'm tempted to take it but if I leave my family won't take care of my mom. She doesn't deserve neglect and I would never forgive myself if I left and she passed away. I'd be leaving my job that I love and I don't know if I could take my pets. \n\nWIBTA if I left my disabled but abusive mother to live in a different state with my partner?", "created_utc": 1684604858, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13n1bmn/wibta_for_moving_with_my_partner_and_leaving_my/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are being TA to yourself if you let this keep you from starting your own life.  Your mother will eventually die at some point, and you should not feel guilty about that.
