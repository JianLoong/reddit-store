Second, you are right about having to care for his mother and eventually the both of them since you have already demonstrated to him you will support him and naturally, that extends to his mother, how could it not?  Third, if you had to support him and he couldn\u2019t even pay his own way what makes you think his mother will be able to split expenses evenly?", "NTA\nYou will bw her carer, youe bf won't lift a finger. Hw has already proven to you that he's happy for you to provide everything. Don't stay in this relationship.", "YTA to yourself. Why are you wasting your time taking care of a grown man?", "His mother at 63 is \"currently unable to walk more than 15 feet without issue.\" ???  Holy smokes. If your BF doesn't realize what kind of care his mother requires, I would suggest that he and his siblings get an elder care specialist in to assess her and spell it out. Their mother's care should their responsibility, not yours. Though I bet that Mom just wants to live with one of her children forever. Your BF should be the one to shut this down, and if he doesn't I would NOT move anywhere with him, not to mention letting him support himself from now on.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, but you and BF need to sit down and come to agreement BEFORE the big move.  MIL never moves in.", "Don't move in with your boyfriend.  Now that he's working, suggest that he get a car and get his own apartment so his mom can move in and you will re-evaluate your relationship at that time.", "NTA. It is not unreasonable that you do not want to become her carer.", "NAH\n\nYou are allowed to set the boundaries of what you feel is acceptable in your living arrangement. Just be aware that this could be a deal breaker for both of you, so it may be that you simply aren't compatible.", "NTA. You're not financially compatible, I would hesitate to connect your life to his any further.", "You are NTA, but I would strongly recommend that you do not move in with this guy. You will come home from work one day to find that he has moved his mother in, and there will be nothing you can do to get her out.", "Lay it out clearly before you make a move.  You're not unreasonable to want to live with your bf and bf only.", "NTA. Not the ATM, either. Let him do it, you have too much on your plate as it is. You will also be the primary caregiver as you and her are both \"female\".\n\nDon't fall for the trap.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Send him off from your parents' home. Set yourself free. The move will happen and mom will show up at your door.

BF could quit his job to take care of mom, and you'll be supporting 3 people. Or he'll keep working and you'll be taking on the bulk of mom's care."]}
