Like i cringe imagining myself doing that, i would just feel like such a shit person so the fact she\u2019s totally fine being that disagreeable would make me instantly take her out of the party.

You can insist that they wear what they want if they are a bridesmaid, but she also has the choice of stepping down, which she did.
