My recommendation is that not having her there at all creates more drama for you (family weighing in and trying to make peace, she gets to play the victim) and creates a rift that is hard to repair (in time, you may be able to move on from dressgate) If it is a large wedding, her being banished to the back so you don't have to deal with her might be the best bet as it doesn't create more drama that you have to deal with. You can also have a few friends run interference and keep an eye on her so she can't have a moment to spoil your day. \n\nAnd of course you can decide she is too much and not invite her at all. You wouldn't be an AH for that, because while I believe a bride should be accommodating to certain things (cost, ensuring everyone is comfortable in their dress by ensuring it isn't too revealing, comes in their size and a bra can be worn IF someone wants that), a color is not that thing. \n\nSuck it up bridesmaids, your dress will be a Halloween costume for someone years down the line when they decide to go as Carrie, that's the circle of life.", "NTA, and JFC your sister is selfish.

It is. It's THE neutral for autumn. NTA.", "NTA for someone saying you have no empathy her statement regarding your dress choices were really rude and insulting. It sounds like you were willing to compromise and find dresses that both you and your wedding party liked, your sister took things to the extreme really quickly and wasn\u2019t be very kind to you.

If they don't have a problem with the color, than I think your sister did you a favor by bowing out, as long as she is totally out.  You don't want her trying to make the others unhappy.

One of the points about the color wheel is that everyone can wear just about any color, as long as it's the right shade.", "I look horrific in blue, especially navy and baby blue, washes me out and i look dead lol but it's a wedding, brides pay for the damn dress they want you to wear and you just need to turn up for this one event. The drama is so childish!", "I mean, if that was what happened, I would agree, but it isn't. Sister willingly backed out of the bridal party and offered to just attend as a guest, and OP straight up uninvited her based on that, which I think makes OP TA. Like, you're welcome to invite whoever you want, but if it was someone you wanted in your bridal party and they backed out because they weren't comfortable in the given outfit, and your response is to straight up uninvite them, I feel like that makes OP a little bit of TA. Sister was admittedly not the most diplomatic in how she expressed herself. But she also was the one to say \"this isn't going to work, it's probably better if I back out so you can do what you want, and I can attend and be comfortable in my outfit.\"", "Except, your missing the big part that makes her the asshole.

OP- your Sister is full of BS because navy is part of those autumn & jewel tone ranges. Like always- for clothing, makeup, home decor. \n\nNavy is not at all a bad color of autumn color tones.

But that more so has to do with the overall attitude of the person/people getting married; not the simple fact of picking out dresses that aren't everyone's favorite. It is their wedding. They get to choose how they want it to look, and if you're participating in the wedding party, they are allowed to choose what you wear. Obviously if they are being rude and entitled and generally insufferable, that's a different thing. But just... picking dresses that suit the color/theme of the wedding without first inquiring about everyone else's most flattering color/cut/style seems pretty standard. \n\nI don't know. I also don't have any strong color or style preferences, so I can't imagine caring about it in any context, let alone for an event that is explicitly meant to make someone who *isn't me* stand out and look and feel beautiful. I think my sister picked out decent bridesmaids dresses for her wedding.

Depending on the style/cut of the sea foam  green dress (no giant bows on butts), I would 100% wear that again.", "With big straw hats and a corsage of fake flowers", "Red with black bows on the butt.  Yep, bride and groom both attended Texas Tech.", "Similar thing here but it\u2019s red for me. Cherry red and blush pink are both so lovely\u2026 and they do something bizarre to my skin tone in photos. \n\nIt does depend on the country / region whether the bride pays for the dress. In my area of the US it\u2019s customary for the bridesmaids to pay. I always thought it was weird but that\u2019s how it is. \n\nAnyway, my sister tried to go for a strange orange color and I gently persuaded against it. But if she had insisted I would have worn that dress with a smile!", "I mean, did she actually back out? \ud83e\udd28 \n\nOP says her sister would still be attending the \u201cgetting ready\u201d parts with the other bridesmaid but wouldn\u2019t wear the same dress. \n\nTo me that sounds like she still expects to be treated like a bridesmaid (and/or get whatever perks may come with that) but will wear and act however she wants as a \u201cguest\u201d, but I could be wrong.", "Oh god \ud83d\ude02 Mustard yellow looks so bad on me. I think I\u2019d cry if I had to wear a dress in that shade. That sounds like a bride who actually might be trying to make the bridesmaids look bad.", "That would be me!", "She has the right to say no to wearing a dress she doesn\u2019t like but she was rude about it. NTA", "I get the part of not outshining the bride (and also, not wearing white, of course). Where I\u2019m from, bridesmaids aren\u2019t normally color coordinated. It often makes wedding-related posts difficult for me to evaluate (so I usually don\u2019t and just marvel from a distance).", "If someone wants me to \"support them\" by dressing in something uncomfortable that will make me hate the entire day, they clearly don't actually value me very much\n\nThey should get a few barbie dolls to dress up instead. That's clearly what she wants.", "We were able to talk the bride out of the sea foam green for a wedding I was in recently. she had been deciding between two colors and one of the bridesmaids had an Olive skin tone, the shade of green honestly made her look Jaundiced. Luckily more dresses came in her second color choice so that made the decision easier.", "You win. Those sound awful.", "I think I was a kid attendee at that wedding because OOF does that ring a bell! Big poofy skirts too?", "Same here!", "If you accept being a bridesmaid, then you\u2019re accepting to wear what you\u2019re told. \n\nIf you don\u2019t like that, that\u2019s fine. Just don\u2019t say yes to be a bridesmaid then.", "This is the way.", "I am so picturing you looking like Jessica Rabbit right now, lol.", "Boobylicious", "I wore an electric bue, sequined, puffed sleeve, off the shoulder monstrosity with a longline strapless bra that cost more than the dress.\n\nI also had a ringlets curl updo that required 86 hairpins and about a bottle of hairspray.", "Exactly what you should do. But I feel for you!", "I actually use three shades of blush (light pink, rose, and something in the middlie) plus highlighter to create dimension on my skin and contour and it makes me look so glowy i would definitely recommend trying that for people who are cool toned. I even contour my nose with 2 of the shades and it works great I'd definitely recommend summer and winters to look into it (im a soft summer my skin tone is neutral rather than cool but the technique works for me)", "My pale ass could never", "Damn! You just barely beat me to it...by six hours.", "I ask you, how precious is this wedding gonna be?", "Okay I'm watching this movie tonight thanks \ud83e\udd23", "My lesbian daughter did this for her brother\u2019s wedding. She\u2019s a rock star.", "AquaNet !!", "Nice to meet you,  my bangs \u00e7aused the other half@", "The only time I\u2019ve ever been stung by a bee was in \u201889. It got caught in my very very thick hairspray, I shook my head, and it landed slap in the middle of my nose, which swelled to the size of Jimmy durante\u2019s. It hurt like a son of a bitch, and I fully blame the 80\u2019s to this day.", "we called them \" exploded bows\"", "I\u2019m scared half to death to have a baby anywhere but in a hospital, but your feelings are absolutely valid. The epidural sounds great if it works, but all the ways it could go wrong and make the situation even more traumatic is also valid. My best friend just had her baby at home for all the reasons you listed. She also had a midwife who had an assistant. Women should be allowed to give birth exactly the way they feel most comfortable, because it\u2019s easily one of the most uncomfortable experiences we go through.  Home births scare me a little but you\u2019re so valid for how you want to give birth. Your sister sounds like an AH.", "That's what I was imagining! Wouldn't really apply to the person I was replying to as only two bridesmaids, but I'm into it now I've imagined it.", "Same!", "Dude. I\u2019d wear the ugliest dress and smile til my lips fell off for the people I love. And laugh hysterically about it later. The aunt sounds like my kind of people.  \n\nThe sister seems to have main character syndrome. Every concern she brought up was centered around her.  She can get her own self ready to wear her own dress so she can feel pretty sitting in the audience.", "My bouquet was on a fan!!", "My mother got married in '71. Bridesmaids wore orange dresses in a thick wintery fabric and very shiny white boots.", "Thank you for this!! I have so much red in my face that most contours look so bad on me. I was using eyeshadow and mixing my own contour!", "You could do some really cool things with fabrics, too, to play on different shapes and textures.", "I can do pastels but look best in jewel or deeply saturated tones. Neutrals are not great (particularly black) and orange/yellow are absolute no goes.", "Brilliant movie", "I was a bridesmaid in the 90s wearing the absolute ugliest dress that cost $360!! That was crazy expensive back then. The wedding was in update NY where the brides family lived and we were all from Los Angeles. Expensive wedding!! My close girlfriend was also a bridesmaid. We complained to each other, but externally always had smiles on our faces. The dresses were so huge and poofy we had to carry them on the plane. Didn\u2019t want to deal with them on the way home so we left them in our hotel room.", "Like I said, I totally get it. Women are treated badly in medical settings period but it's the *worst* when giving birth. If I were healthy and able to have kids, I would go as low on the medical interventions as possible but would probably pick a birth center of some kind that aren't so clinical. I would insist on having a midwife and/or doula. Or both. But yeah, not happening for me. All I can do is support other women in their birth and post-partum journeys, so that you retain as much autonomy in the process as possible, while remaining as safe as you can be.", "Yess. I wish there were other life occasions where you could justify spending a bunch of money to dress up with your besties. \n\nApparently in China it's common to do wedding photo shoots with a bunch of different outfits - and one of the popular wedding dresses is actually a Western wedding dress, but red (since red = celebration and white = mourning.) Which sounds awesome to me!", "I can relate. I have dark brown hair and eyes so everyone assumes brown/tan/beige/taupe will look good on me. Nope! Those colors are awful as they wash me out. While rust wouldn't be the most flattering shade, I can do it. But copper and orange would be a no. The only color worse than orange for me is yellow.", "I want to see an actual grooms red velvet armadillo cake\u2026.", "You seem cool.", "I have (currently) teal hair and blue eyes. Hair was pink all summer. It\u2019s naturally light brown or dark blonde but is graying. I\u2019m fair skinned but I can get a tan (very slowly). My ancestry looks to be Irish/English/northern France, so pick a pasty white color, lol. I do know I have pink undertones rather than olive or orange, but makeup-wise I\u2019ve worn nearly every imaginable color (eyes/lips), and can use almost anything as blush (I have super pink, neutral, and super orange), as long as I don\u2019t go overboard with it.", "Lol!", "Aw thanks. I'm a bit odd irl, but I try my best. You must be cool, you have immaculate taste. :D", "I'm of German/British Isles/Czechoslovakian ancestry. I can't tan at ALL. The one and only time I got a tan I was in the mountains in TN and was wearing SPF 30. I actually got sunburned through an airplane window once :(. You can actually see my veins and trace them all the way up my arms and across my chest. When I was younger, the palms of my hands under my thumbs always looked like they were bruised. Summertime I become a hermit and pretty much behave as if I'm a vampire.\n\nEye makeup I can pretty much do any color than black. \n\nHit reply too soon:\nWith how pale I am, black is just too harsh. Was great during the 90's goth/heroin chic look :p. Even thought gh I can't wear brown I can do brown for eye makeup. I can't do most colors other than red or orange. But, like with clothes, shades of pink/purple are best. Cheeks have to be pink, I can't even get away with peach. Lipstick is usually a wine/berry color. I want soo bad to be able to do the sexy Hollywood starlet red lips. But EVERY red I've ever tried ends up looking orangey on me. Which is my second worst color. I've pretty much given up. Don't want to keep spending money only to try it and immediately \"Nope, that looks awful\"."]}
