Clover is not that far from Chloe. Your parents are being rude and probably confusing the hell out of the poor pupper. I would reneg on letting them keep the dog when you leave and take her with you. It sounds like you have a very strong bond and she would be better off with you.", "Where\u2019s the respect for you? Wow!! Her name is Clover. Why did your step father choose to be the asshole and change it. He\u2019s the one confusing the poor dog , not you. Stand your ground. Call her by her REAL name. Good luck", "NTA Sorry for my english but yeah dogs can answer to both names really. They are smart creature, that's why they also recognize surnames. It in the tone you used when calling her and your body language ( sorry for the short answer, but with my english I can't delve in all the mechanics behind. )", "NTA your dogs name is Clover. She will never answer to a name she didn't grow up learning. The rest of your family needs to learn that.\n\nWe adopted a dog several years ago whi never responded to his name. We changed it and started aggressively training him to recognize it. You can't just change a dog name after a couple years and expect them to respond", "NTA\n\nShe's always going to respond better to you, because you have a bond with her from her earliest days. Wanting to call her the name she's always had is hardly being disrespectful or causing problems.", "NTA - She's YOUR dog. She's always going to listen to you because she's YOUR dog. Dog's have memories. People don't think they do, but they DO. They have very LONG memories. They remember who they lived with, who they loved, and who loved THEM. You step-father should've respected the name that YOU had for the pup, and not tried to change it.", "NTA.  Your step-father needs to understand it is not just the name the dog is responding to.  It is the bond you have with the dog.  That's why the dog listens more to you.  She probably sees you as her alpha.  Maybe you can Google some info on bonding with a dog and share it with your step-father.   Your step-father might be old school and be approaching things strictly from a behavior and training perspective.  The names are close enough I think to use both, but I'm no expert.  Playtime is a great way to bond with a pet.", "NTA.\n\nIt's her name. \n\nYou know what? Just for funsies, start calling your parents by similar renditions of their names (eg. Todd instead of Tom) for a few weeks and see if anything changes.", "My dog has several names. Everybody in the house has their own nicknames for her. She answers everyone, because everyone has worked to develop a relationship with her.\n\nNTA.", "I think the issue here you are not being honest from the start. You said you don\u2019t mind them changing the name but you keep calling the dog, clover. And now, the dog is a family dog. I don\u2019t think you are an asshole but you could have handled the situation better. But if my must pick between you and your stepdad then YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
