{"id": 4519, "submission_id": "zjiiin", "title": "AITA for walking out at dinner when my dad put on Abbott Elementary?", "selftext": "I (F23) am a recently graduated 6th grade teacher. I'll preface this by saying I am still living at home with my parents (51M and 51F) to help save money for the time being.\n\nLast year was my first year teaching at an elementary school, and I would describe it as hell on earth. My bosses were verbally abusive, and she gave me negative evaluations for the most ridiculous reasons (Ex. A kid spilled cut like kut, I had kids count the number of red and white stripes on the American flag during our social studies lesson and had them practice adding them since we were learning addition). \n\nIt was my first ever job and I didn't know how to advocate for myself. Everyone at my school was having such a bad time with our bosses that the transfer list had to be capped to one person per grade level, and all of my admin was replaced at the end of the year with an entirely new staff. For me, the school year was so bad for my mental health that, without getting too specific, I had to be put on medical leave for 2 months, was temporarily restricted from using a vehicle, and was required to see a therapist.\n\nI wanted to give up teaching entirely, but I decided to try one more year at a new district and at a new grade level, and I have fallen in love with it. I'm so much happier now than I was before.\n\nThe problem here comes from my father. Around June, he started hounding me to watch a show called Abbott Elementary. He thought it would be something I enjoyed because he thought I could relate to the teacher's struggles.\n\nI refused. I told him I did not want to watch it after what I went through at my old elementary school. I didn't want to be reminded of it, and I didn't want to think of work outside of work if I could help it.\n\nHe accepted this for a while, but when he saw that I liked my new job in September, he started pressing again. Every time he asked, I still told him no, that I wasn't ready to watch it. I didn't want to see a visible reminder of what I had gone through the last school year. He continued asking at least once a week, no matter how forceful I have been with telling him no.\n\nTonight, at dinner, we were sitting in the living room with dinner trays and watching TV when he pulls up the show. I stared at him, and he said something along the lines of, \"Let's just see if you like it.\"\n\nI quickly ate the rest of my food, stood up, and walked out to go to my room. He asked if I was really leaving over a TV show, and I told him I had made it clear to him several times that I did not want to watch it and that I wasn't going to.\n\nI'm wondering if all of this is just me being extra as hell and if I should have just sat through a few minutes of the damn thing.

Omg, I went through the same thing, different job. \n\nI used to work for Google at HQ in Mountain View. It was fun until it wasn't. I don't work for them anymore, don't want to work in tech and don't want to work in Corp Am at all.\n\nI started dating a guy who watched that tech show on HBO ( I don't think it's on anymore). He put it on when we were at his place and I felt sick to my stomach. I was instantly reminded of the shit hole that is the tech industry in Silicon Valley. I told him I just couldn't watch it and he understood. \n\nI feel for you. I don't think your dad really understands what you're going through or how being exposed to that show triggers you. Seeing that show for me, transferred me back into an extremely stressful and dire situation/environment. I hated it.", "NTA.  You gave him an easy boundary that you made clear from the gecko and he stomped it.  Aspects of the show trigger you and bring back traumatic memories.", "NTA but could you ask him why it is so important? Does he think it will help you work thru your first year or maybe help him understand by opening the door to communication. Maybe it is his way of caring. I have zero clue since I obviously don't know either of you, but it would be worth an ask at a non angry, non confrontive time when he is not suggesting you watch it.", "NTA however trivial he thinks your boundaries are he is not respecting them. You made it very clear you didn't want to watch it and when he pushed over the line you reacted in the appropriate way. Seems so odd that he is obsessed over the show. I'm sure it comes from a good place but what he did was not the right choice. I understand your comment on not wanting to expose yourself to work related things outside of work, it gets very tiring and honestly I don't need reminders of my working day outside work.", "I\u2019m also a teacher. I love Abbott Elementary\u2014 it is hilarious and it validates my experience as a teacher. My friends and I watch it and can relate to everything! I think that\u2019s what your dad wanted for you, but you clearly still have trauma from your first year of teaching. Look into getting some counseling for the residual stress of your last position. \n\nNAH", "NTA. \"No\" is a complete sentence- excellent job keeping your boundaries.", "NTA. It doesnt matter if other people think it's funny and cutesy, you have personal reasons not to watch it. For reasons relating to my family farm i have the same relationship to The Ranch. \n\nMy SO pushed me about watching it for a while and then got that i was just not into it and *started respecting my boundaries because he cares about me.* \n\nI dont think your dad intenda to hurt you but he is being an AH. Hell, in your position Jess from New Girl could be too much...\n\nHe doesnt have to understand. He just needs to respect.", "NTA. \n\nYou told him repeatedly and in no uncertain terms that you did not want to watch this show. It\u2019s really no different from a police officer or firefighter not wanting to watch a show about their line of work.\n\nHeck, a friend of my Mom can\u2019t stand The Office-it reminds her too much of her last job.", "NTA - Your strong reaction to it is likely a reaction to the trauma you experienced at your previous school. It takes time and effort to recover from trauma like that. You say you were in therapy: I hope you have a therapist that you like and that you continue to go. Time and better teaching experiences will also help you move forward.\n\nYou did a good job enforcing your boundaries. Although it's unfortunate to have to leave a family meal, sometimes it's necessary. Probably, your dad thinks that you watching the show will help you heal. It's ok to say no to that even though he's trying to help.", "NTA!!!\n\nI went thru the same thing\u2014 I worked at a professional children\u2019s performing arts center from 2005 to 2012; we would regularly mount popular musicals casting kids alongside professional equity actors. I did over 35 productions there. \n\n**I cannot count the number of times someone told me to watch \u201cGlee.\u201d** I was always like, *No, it\u2019s not for me, I don\u2019t like to watch shows about work outside of work* etc. The teachers, my colleagues, the students and parents were always like \u201cOh come on. It\u2019s totally your life! You would relate to it, it\u2019s soooooo goOOOooOoD\u201d and no matter what I said it didn\u2019t stop. \n\nOne particular summer, at least 2-3 times a day, one of the teenaged students would start randomly singing (what I quickly learned was that show\u2019s version of) \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believing\u201d prompting everyone else to join in (beautifully, tbh, with perfect harmonies \u2014 one has to audition to join this school) and it drove me **insane.** To this day I have never watched an episode of Glee, and that song is kind of ruined for me forever.", "NTA - You made a boundary, and good on you for enforcing it.", "NTA \n\nINFO:  Why is he so reluctant on watching that show?

It is understandable that you would like to forget about it and move on.  \n\nYour father wanting you to watch this TV show may have been to help you.

Dad is free to enjoy the show as much as he wants. Just leave OP out of it. If it\u2019s really such a small, silly thing, it should be even *easier* to respect the boundary. \n\nOP made it clear they had zero interest in the show and did not want to watch it. Dad refused to hear OP\u2019s \u201cNo\u201d and actually take it to heart, and repeatedly pushed the issue until he basically cornered them into a situation where he thought he could strong-arm them into watching it in a group setting and then went all Shocked Pikachu when OP removed themself from the situation entirely.\n\nThe show is not the problem. You could replace it with literally any other thing. The problem is dad didn\u2019t care about OP saying no on something that should have been beyond simple to abide by. The repeated stomping over a perfectly acceptable boundary is the problem, and shows how little Dad actually respects OP and how they feel.

You *are* being extra as hell. \n\nIt's a cutesy feel-good show, and as someone who works in school admin it's very relatable.

This happens in close families every single day. It's not traumatizing unless there's an underlying issue.

I would agree if he asked and she flipped out, but she clearly stated her intentions and stated repeatedly she didn\u2019t want to watch it, and that\u2019s not okay for her? WTF. She should be allowed to decide what she wants to watch and what she doesn\u2019t without being forced. For the record op, you\u2019re absolutely NTA", "This is a bad take IMO. We can\u2019t always control what makes us feel bad. To you this show is cutesy and feel-good. OP clearly doesn\u2019t feel that way. \n\nETA: OP isn\u2019t likely to enjoy the show as they expressed multiple times they did not want to watch it. \n\nI can\u2019t watch Scrubs and honestly hate talking about it because I experienced something traumatic after watching it. I would walk out/leave if someone put it on. Does that make me extra?", "There's equally no reason for him to push it. There's so much entertainment available to choose from, why insist so hard on this? I think some people just have to feel like they're right, whether it's worthwhile or not.", "So you\u2019re the principal Ava\u2026.", "She wasn't 'extra'. She didn't smash the TV, rip the remote out her father's hands and toss it out the window. She didn't even raise her voice. She simply finished her meal and walked away. I don't know how she could have been calmer.", "Right? She made a boundary, said no, and her father stomped all over that boundary continuously. If no means no in other situations, why doesn\u2019t it me no here. No matter how cute the show may be, she said no and that\u2019s final", "I did the same thing with that show. Wrote it off for years before falling in love with it.", "I watched 3 episodes and didn\u2019t like it. Someone else told me that\u2019s right where it started to get good, after the first 3 episodes and they were right and I loved it. OP, you\u2019re NTA, entertainment is subjective. I watched SVU incessantly for years but after work was a bit too similar I can\u2019t stomach it as entertainment", "I think we\u2019re out of the N-A-H territory when the dad\u2019s been hounding OP for MONTHS about watching this show and refusing to respect OP\u2019s boundaries to the point of ambushing them with the show. Whether or not people think it\u2019s ridiculous for OP to not watch the show, a no should be respected. Toddlers understand no ffs.\nNTA @ OP", "Honestly, I feel like I could watch a show about the grade I teach now because the experience has just been so much better. But yes, we do tend to clash. It\u2019s never quite been like this before though. Usually I can recognize when I\u2019m wrong and I apologize, and he\u2019ll do the same, but this is just a standstill.", "she said no. no means no. NTA", "He turned it into a power struggle. AND is pushing that power struggle to the point of not even trying to get her to agree, hes *ambushing* her with the show. \n\n*It doesnt matter what his intentions are.*  \n\nShe had a horrible experience and she doesnt want to spend time on something that relates to thst experience. Sounds like it was perfextly clear to everyone how traumstic her experience was. So whether he thinks she woukd like it or not doesnt actuslly mstter. \n\nForcing a kid to \"just try something and see if you like it\" is some 80s bull.", "So, no means yes now?", "I\u2019d just like to clarify that I didn\u2019t leave the house, I went upstairs to my room to separate myself from the show.\n\nMaybe one day I\u2019ll try it, but I\u2019m not sure when that will be yet.", "Just f'ing stop. The number of people here who cant take no for an answer is honestly disturbing.", "Lmao That's what it was called, Silicon Valley. Ha!", "I enjoyed the show but it was definitely a little *too real*.", "That's enough for her. I watched what, two minutes? Watching it or not isn't the point. She said no. I love Abbot Elementary, it's funny and charming. OP is not ready to watch it, maybe she never will be.", "I'm a teacher. I don't watch it because I just don't have the energy for more school after school. The teachers that I know are split; a lot of them like it a lot and a lot of them have no interest in watching a show about school when they're trying to decompress from school. Both are fine options.", "Check the username!", "\ud83e\udd23\u2620\ufe0f", "Your post didn't indicate he's been a serial pain so I am guessing he watched you struggle and is concerned. Good luck.", "So\u2026. they just\u2026 *Stopped Believin\u2019?*\n\nI never really Started Believin\u2019", "I love musicals too! *My Fair Lady, White Christmas* I literally just watched yesterday, *Bye Bye Birdie,* *Chicago, Dancer in the Dark,* even. I really could go on and on. I chose to work at that theater because I\u2019ve been a theater geek myself my whole life. \n\nBut the fact that *Glee* took place in a school, with the characters being teenagers and teachers singing already popular and immortalized songs was literally 10 - 12 hours of my everyday except Mondays, for seven years. After a while my job just became plain old stressful *work.* There was no way in hell I was gonna allow that energy during my off hours, when I was likely drinking lots of wine and catching up on my swear words.", "\ud83e\udd14\nIDK, he sounds really weird right now.\n\nSit down and ask him to be honest.", "Okay. I think OP is TA for brushing off her dad's attempts to bond and relate to her. It's fine if you disagree with me.", "It's inappropriate for me to comment on your personal trauma. \n\nAs far as this post goes, I can't imagine a half hour family friendly sitcom being more traumatizing to OP that actually going back into the classroom, which she does every day. \n\nIt's literally just a silly little sitcom. And they were already watching TV together; for OP to just get up and leave because her dad dared put on a show that he thinks she might like is a supreme overreaction.", "Dunno why you're thinking the worst of the dad. His daughter is a young, hardworking teacher who dealt with a shitty boss, and the show is about a young, hardworking teacher who deals with a shitty boss... \n\nIt's not about entertainment and it's not about who's \"right.\" Its about sharing in a piece of media that depicts OP's experience in a lighthearted way, so the family can enjoy and relate to it together.", "I would give anything to have a principal like Ava over the one I currently have", "More of a Gregory actually!", "She handled it very well all things considered.", "^^^^^^^^^\n\nTHIS!\n\nYou have to wonder why he keeps pushing it?", "Nice! Don\u2019t write it. Maybe next summer when you\u2019re away from the classroom.\n\nCongrats on finding a good school.", "I related my experience and understanding. I also said she has the right to boundaries.\n\nAs a former teacher of 7 years and have experienced (likely) most of what she\u2019s gone through, I can safely say I know what I\u2019m talking about. All schools are different but the struggles are almost identical.", "Nice one!\n\nYes I think that\u2019s what most people remember about it today.", "Dad can bond with her over a show she wants to watch and can enjoy.", "A boundary is a boundary, and \"No\" is a complete sentence. Without being in the OP's head you can't possibly say how they would feel - you're projecting how you think they *should* feel. I'm sure it was quite difficult to walk back into a classroom, but it turned out to be a warm and welcoming place. If they don't want to be reminded of past trauma, they don't need to be! You're telling the OP that their feelings aren't valid. \n\nOP, keep your boundaries, heal in your own time, and monumentally huge NTA NTA NTA!", "OPs experience was not lighthearted. It sounds deeply traumatic and carried physical and mental health consequences she is still recovering from. \n\n*Maybe* she will eventually drcide shes ready to laugh about it. But she isnt now and that should be respected. \n\nJust because her dad wants her to be ready to laugh doesnt mean she is and its incrdibly insensitive and brutish to force that.", "Hah. At least she knows she does nothing.", "No is not a complete sentence. Not to people you care about anyway.", "Why should she keep repeating her reasoning? She explained multiple times, and wasn't being heard. At that point, \"NO\" is perfectly reasonable."]}
