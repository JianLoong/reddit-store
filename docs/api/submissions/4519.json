{"id": 4519, "submission_id": "zjiiin", "title": "AITA for walking out at dinner when my dad put on Abbott Elementary?", "selftext": "I (F23) am a recently graduated 6th grade teacher. I'll preface this by saying I am still living at home with my parents (51M and 51F) to help save money for the time being.\n\nLast year was my first year teaching at an elementary school (EDIT for clarification: I taught first grade), and I would describe it as hell on earth. My bosses were verbally abusive, and she gave me negative evaluations for the most ridiculous reasons (Ex. A kid spilled cut like kut, I had kids count the number of red and white stripes on the American flag during our social studies lesson and had them practice adding them since we were learning addition). \n\nIt was my first ever job and I didn't know how to advocate for myself. Everyone at my school was having such a bad time with our bosses that the transfer list had to be capped to one person per grade level, and all of my admin was replaced at the end of the year with an entirely new staff. For me, the school year was so bad for my mental health that, without getting too specific, I had to be put on medical leave for 2 months, was temporarily restricted from using a vehicle, and was required to see a therapist.\n\nI wanted to give up teaching entirely, but I decided to try one more year at a new district and at a new grade level, and I have fallen in love with it. I'm so much happier now than I was before.\n\nThe problem here comes from my father. Around June, he started hounding me to watch a show called Abbott Elementary. He thought it would be something I enjoyed because he thought I could relate to the teacher's struggles.\n\nI refused. I told him I did not want to watch it after what I went through at my old elementary school. I didn't want to be reminded of it, and I didn't want to think of work outside of work if I could help it.\n\nHe accepted this for a while, but when he saw that I liked my new job in September, he started pressing again. Every time he asked, I still told him no, that I wasn't ready to watch it. I didn't want to see a visible reminder of what I had gone through the last school year. He continued asking at least once a week, no matter how forceful I have been with telling him no.\n\nTonight, at dinner, we were sitting in the living room with dinner trays and watching TV when he pulls up the show. I stared at him, and he said something along the lines of, \"Let's just see if you like it.\"\n\nI quickly ate the rest of my food, stood up, and walked out to go to my room. He asked if I was really leaving over a TV show, and I told him I had made it clear to him several times that I did not want to watch it and that I wasn't going to.\n\nI'm wondering if all of this is just me being extra as hell and if I should have just sat through a few minutes of the damn thing.

Omg, I went through the same thing, different job. \n\nI used to work for Google at HQ in Mountain View. It was fun until it wasn't. I don't work for them anymore, don't want to work in tech and don't want to work in Corp Am at all.\n\nI started dating a guy who watched that tech show on HBO ( I don't think it's on anymore). He put it on when we were at his place and I felt sick to my stomach. I was instantly reminded of the shit hole that is the tech industry in Silicon Valley. I told him I just couldn't watch it and he understood. \n\nI feel for you. I don't think your dad really understands what you're going through or how being exposed to that show triggers you. Seeing that show for me, transferred me back into an extremely stressful and dire situation/environment. I hated it.", "NTA.  You gave him an easy boundary that you made clear from the gecko and he stomped it.  Aspects of the show trigger you and bring back traumatic memories.", "NTA but could you ask him why it is so important? Does he think it will help you work thru your first year or maybe help him understand by opening the door to communication. Maybe it is his way of caring. I have zero clue since I obviously don't know either of you, but it would be worth an ask at a non angry, non confrontive time when he is not suggesting you watch it.", "NTA however trivial he thinks your boundaries are he is not respecting them. You made it very clear you didn't want to watch it and when he pushed over the line you reacted in the appropriate way. Seems so odd that he is obsessed over the show. I'm sure it comes from a good place but what he did was not the right choice. I understand your comment on not wanting to expose yourself to work related things outside of work, it gets very tiring and honestly I don't need reminders of my working day outside work.", "I\u2019m also a teacher. I love Abbott Elementary\u2014 it is hilarious and it validates my experience as a teacher. My friends and I watch it and can relate to everything! I think that\u2019s what your dad wanted for you, but you clearly still have trauma from your first year of teaching. Look into getting some counseling for the residual stress of your last position. \n\nNAH", "NTA. \"No\" is a complete sentence- excellent job keeping your boundaries.", "NTA. It doesnt matter if other people think it's funny and cutesy, you have personal reasons not to watch it. For reasons relating to my family farm i have the same relationship to The Ranch. \n\nMy SO pushed me about watching it for a while and then got that i was just not into it and *started respecting my boundaries because he cares about me.* \n\nI dont think your dad intenda to hurt you but he is being an AH. Hell, in your position Jess from New Girl could be too much...\n\nHe doesnt have to understand. He just needs to respect.", "NTA. \n\nYou told him repeatedly and in no uncertain terms that you did not want to watch this show. It\u2019s really no different from a police officer or firefighter not wanting to watch a show about their line of work.\n\nHeck, a friend of my Mom can\u2019t stand The Office-it reminds her too much of her last job.", "NTA - Your strong reaction to it is likely a reaction to the trauma you experienced at your previous school. It takes time and effort to recover from trauma like that. You say you were in therapy: I hope you have a therapist that you like and that you continue to go. Time and better teaching experiences will also help you move forward.\n\nYou did a good job enforcing your boundaries. Although it's unfortunate to have to leave a family meal, sometimes it's necessary. Probably, your dad thinks that you watching the show will help you heal. It's ok to say no to that even though he's trying to help.", "NTA!!!\n\nI went thru the same thing\u2014 I worked at a professional children\u2019s performing arts center from 2005 to 2012; we would regularly mount popular musicals casting kids alongside professional equity actors. I did over 35 productions there. \n\n**I cannot count the number of times someone told me to watch \u201cGlee.\u201d** I was always like, *No, it\u2019s not for me, I don\u2019t like to watch shows about work outside of work* etc. The teachers, my colleagues, the students and parents were always like \u201cOh come on. It\u2019s totally your life! You would relate to it, it\u2019s soooooo goOOOooOoD\u201d and no matter what I said it didn\u2019t stop. \n\nOne particular summer, at least 2-3 times a day, one of the teenaged students would start randomly singing (what I quickly learned was that show\u2019s version of) \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believing\u201d prompting everyone else to join in (beautifully, tbh, with perfect harmonies \u2014 one has to audition to join this school) and it drove me **insane.** To this day I have never watched an episode of Glee, and that song is kind of ruined for me forever.", "NTA - You made a boundary, and good on you for enforcing it.", "NTA \n\nINFO:  Why is he so reluctant on watching that show?

It is understandable that you would like to forget about it and move on.  \n\nYour father wanting you to watch this TV show may have been to help you.

Dad is free to enjoy the show as much as he wants. Just leave OP out of it. If it\u2019s really such a small, silly thing, it should be even *easier* to respect the boundary. \n\nOP made it clear they had zero interest in the show and did not want to watch it. Dad refused to hear OP\u2019s \u201cNo\u201d and actually take it to heart, and repeatedly pushed the issue until he basically cornered them into a situation where he thought he could strong-arm them into watching it in a group setting and then went all Shocked Pikachu when OP removed themself from the situation entirely.\n\nThe show is not the problem. You could replace it with literally any other thing. The problem is dad didn\u2019t care about OP saying no on something that should have been beyond simple to abide by.

This happens in close families every single day. It's not traumatizing unless there's an underlying issue.

Is there another show you can watch together or activity you both enjoy?", "NTA\u2026.this whole I like it so I\u2019m going to force you to like it attitude is so\u2026.1930\u2019s Germany\u2026..your FIL is stuck in a decade and mindset that requires some stones\u2026.that will be conveniently used to teach people lessons.", "NTA, but AE is basically just \"The Office\" set in an elementary school, so if you like that show, you might be able to tolerate AE. \"Pam and Jim\" are getting together soon now that Pam has lost her loser ex-finance.", "Buckle up! Your parents are getting older and if it's anything like my dad (73) it's just beginning! NAH. Parents never stop thinking they know what we like and it can be annoying but it's out of love. Just browse this sub for awhile you'll see it could be much worse! Glad you didn't give up and found a better job.", "He stomped the gecko", "Makes me think of a little gecko lawyer advocating for people. 10/10, very good choice.", "I'm in a similar situation tbh. I'm a chemist. Throughout my university years and every time I tell someone about my profession, I'm guaranteed to get at least one comment about Breaking Bad. I simply can't bring myself to watch that show, never seen it, never will. The gut wrenching cringe just overrides every great opinion I heard about it.", "I disagree on N A H. That\u2019s truly great that it\u2019s been helpful for you. But OP had a very clear boundary and dad didn\u2019t listen. Just because someone wants to help, doesn\u2019t give them the right to not listen to the person they are trying to help. OP was NTA & dad was the AH.", "I taught first grade last year.", "They\u2019re a legend!!! Takes a hot second to register but I haven\u2019t seen them in ages and now realizing I\u2019ve missed them so much !!!", "lol it\u2019s illogical to act like intentions are completely irrelevant in enforcing boundaries. not all boundaries are equal \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Grief can also come at random times. My grandfather's death was very traumatic, but it was such a time of upheaval that I pushed through, and then had to keep pushing through for a few years.\n\nAnd then one day I randomly watched a Hindi movie called 'Piku', on the recommendation of my parents. Hilarious movie, but when a serious moment hit (very unexpectedly) I burst into violent tears out of the blue and had a panic attack. The brain man, it gets you so randomly.", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss. I loved Zoey\u2019s Extraordinary Playlist\u2014- it was heartwarming and funny, although I did also cry quite a bit. I was upset that it was cancelled.", "They may not all be equal, but forcing other people's boundaries in the absence of the genuine safety concern is always an AH move.", "They may not all be equal, but forcing other people's boundaries in the absence of the genuine safety concern is always an AH move.", "The boundary-pusher's intent might affect how kindly I assert the boundary but I'm having trouble imagining a scenario where it would affect if the boundary is enforced.", "They're not blaming an entire generation. One of the things generations tend to share are trends in attitudes. Mental health is the subject of a big attitude shift. This isn't attributing fault to anyone for anything. It's just a note about that shift in attitude.", "NTA No you left for repeatedly having your boundaries stomped. I worked in Parliament and I can\u2019t watch political satire. It takes me to a dark place so I relate OP. Your father was being arrogant and unknowingly cruel.", "NTA. \n\nIt's like any time someone recommends a new food, song, movie, etc. Maybe I'll try it, maybe I won't. It depends. However, *pestering* me about trying it is counterproductive. When it's a matter of mental health, counterproductive transitions to **disrespectful.** \nI don't know why your dad is so obsessed with the show, or thinks the problem is that it's just too inconvenient for you to simply turn it on so he'll remedy that for you at dinner?? You didn't walk out over a show, you walked out over his disrespect. Would it be easier if he understood your feelings? Of course. But that shouldn\u2019t be necessary. I've never been pregnant, so I can't quite understand what others go through, but I can still respect it! Maybe dad needs a therapy session with you just to understand boundaries. Maybe you can talk to him about finding another show to watch together. \n\nBtw... your dad is at an age where some docs recommend routine prostate exams or colonoscopies. I know a lot of people don't like being reminded about that, especially on a weekly basis. Imagine if you brought the doc to dinner?.... \n\nSidenote: I'm glad you gave your career a second chance. Sometimes the problem is the work environment, not the job itself. Learning to advocate for yourself is a process; it's easier said than done.", "NTA, Even if you had not had the horrible experience you did, the fact that you said you didn't want to watch it should have been the end of it.", "NTA\n\nI can understand why you don't want to watch it but I don't understand why your father is so obsessed with forcing you to watch it.  Why does it matter to him?  WTF is wrong with him?", "NTA. Your dad asked, you said no, now he needs to stop bothering you and just accept your answer. \n\nNo means no, it doesn\u2019t mean keep bothering you until he gets the answer he wants.", "Yta, not for not watching the show, but damn you had a full on mental breakdown due to teaching and you come back to possibly warp some more minds? You think these little kids forgot their teacher going off the rails", "NTA. I'm not big on television and nothing gets under my skin faster than someone repeatedly asking me to watch something I've already declined. It's just a show. Why can't he just let it go?", "NTA. As a teacher I never watch teacher movies that seem to say you can only be successful at your job if you almost kill yourself doing it. My MIL pushed and pushed me to watch Freedom Writers and it became really contentious; essentially leading me to a similar situation you found yourself in.   \n\n\nI do watch Abbot though, and though it's different from the \"savior\" movies, I can understand not wanting to watch it, especially after a hard year. I have 23 years in, and the perspectives on the show ring true but can hit really close to home, especially if you're new to the profession. Good on you for finding a better fit and not giving up entirely.   \n\n\nMostly it's okay to not want to watch your work be entertainment - I always imagined doctors felt the same about ER and Grey's or lawyers about Law and Order and Ally McBeal, etc.", "NTA\n\nDad, of course, knows better than you what fricking television shows you should be watching.", "My wife loves that show. She had some really bad experiences at her first few schools and actually taught at a school that was very similar to Abbott. I think at some point in the future you might actually enjoy it because it really does a good job of shining a spotlight on what teachers go through especially in underfunded schools. But that doesn't really matter here. I think most people consider therapy to be something that is beneficial and healthy; tying someone to a chair and forcing them into therapy, however, is not generally seen as acceptable. Doesn't matter how much you think someone would like something or how beneficial you think it would be for them, trying to force or coerce them into it isn't okay. So NTA. Boundaries were set, and boundaries were violated. That is not okay. \n\n  Tldr: While I agree with your dad on the show, forcing something on someone and violating their boundaries is unacceptable. Road to hell, good intentions, and whatnot.", "Not a teacher, but I got sucked into watching this show a couple of times and thought it was insipidly stupid.  I did not find any humor in the level of incompetence and malicious actions portrayed.  \n\nMore importantly - you need to set a clear boundary with dad.  At a time when the show is NOT on (and preferably the television is off, and potentially your mom is present), state clearly, \"Dad, you know of the trauma I experienced during my first year of teaching.  I do not find this show enjoyable or humorous, and I do not intend to watch it.  Do not ask me again.  Do not bring it up again.  Do not intentionally pull it up to view with me in the room without first warning me.  To do so could potentially set my recovery back or completely derail it.  Your failure to follow this simple request tells me what you think about me as an adult and how you view my experience, and if it continues it will significantly impact our future relations.  This is not open to negotiation, and there will be no more warnings.\"\n\nThen, if he fails to heed your request, leave the room.  Hell, leave the entire house, don't tell them where you are going and come back later than you might normally.  Leverage those parental instincts to protect by disappearing (phone off for them) for a few hours and let them worry a bit.\n\nIf Dad still doesn't understand, you may need to move out.  Good luck.", "NTA. What the f is wrong with your father, that he is willing to completely steamroller over a very clear lack of consent.", "And this is my argument to all the guys who didn\u2019t understand why I didn\u2019t want to watch the Office or Community.\n\nNta", "NTA. Why would you play his \"Let's see if we can resurface trauma and see my daughter has a mental breakdown\" game?", "I think you meant \u201caspics of the show\u201d. Aspects are a jelly.", "Good to see you around, m'dude LMAO", "I think I love you! Lol", "Good point, LCJ75. I've never seen the show, but maybe he's just trying to find a way to relate. I looked it up & it's a sitcom, so maybe he thinks it will provide some comic relief. OP still has valid concerns, of course. Not every bad day or traumatic experience becomes something you can laugh about in the future. On the contrary, watching others laugh about similar experiences could be very hurtful.", "Seconding (thirding ? Fourthing?) this sentiment. I can\u2019t watch Silicon Valley because even when they\u2019re callling out shit behavior it still felt way too real and mimicked my daily work life. Husband loved the show but I could never enjoy it, so he watched it solo. No idea why OP\u2019s father needs her to watch the same shows as he does.", "I will say I made sure the kids never knew what happened, it wasn\u2019t their fault and they didn\u2019t need all that pushed on them. I kept it together in class, even though it was hard as fuck, and when I came back from medical leave and the kids asked questions, I just told them I had been really really sick. They took that as an answer and didn\u2019t really ask anymore.", "OP, I\u2019m also a teacher and I don\u2019t enjoy Abbott Elementary. Personally it doesn\u2019t reflect my experiences as a teacher (I primarily teach kids who are recent immigrants to the country or who do not learn English until they start elementary school). I also\u2026.just don\u2019t really think it\u2019s that funny. And that\u2019s okay! \n\nYou don\u2019t ever have to watch it or like it. You\u2019re not any more or less a teacher because of it.", "My first teaching experience was very similar to yours--working at a badly run elementary school with toxic administration, frequent student violence and minimal institutional support. \n\nI *can't stand* Abbott Elementary, because it just reminds me too much of my previous workplace trauma. \n\nYour dad should be doing a better job of understanding and respecting your boundaries, and in the meanwhile, please keep advocating for yourself.", "Look, I'm a former teacher, I love Abbott Elementary, but sometimes it's PAINFULLY accurate and I've cringed at some moments. Even if you didn't have any associated trauma from your experience, you're allowed to not want to watch something simply because you don't feel like it. You owe nobody any explanations. NTA.", "I personally agree with OP that I don\u2019t see anything comedic about teaching. I find it hard to sit down and watch a comedic show about teachers when I had to call CPS because a student disclosed abuse to me, or when I know a break is coming up and we have students who won\u2019t be able to eat without school breakfast and lunch.", "She's still a teacher because she decided, on her own, that she wanted to give it another try (in a different district). That's not the same as someone else wanting to impose things on you.", "Having a character flaw doesn't make someone \"the worst\". It makes them human, and sometimes an asshole. I'm a good person, and sometimes I am an asshole. The dad is being unnecessarily pushy and focused on this one TV show, when he should just let it go. Saying \"no thanks\" once should have been enough.", "The show is wonderful. But if you've lost a loved one that way, it might be tough. I can't watch any show with Alzheimer's. I've seen it too much in my family to ever watch it in entertainment.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I saw \"The Notebook\" exactly once and refuse to watch it again. I quit Grey's Anatomy when they started the arc about Meredith's mom. It's all just too much, you know?", "What exactly does \"It sucks but the older generation...\" mean to you?"]}
