If it was almost anything else, I might recommend that you cut her some slack. But since this involves the safety and well-being of kids, you did the right thing.", "NTA.  Running an illegal in-home daycare is an AH move.  I understand she's in a tough spot, but she should have done it the right way if it was that important.  I'm not sure, but the fact that she's been caught running the business illegally may mean that she won't be able to get a license in the future.", "NTA: Regulations are written in blood.

However,  you might want to sit down with your husband to really explain why you did it (ie that you weren't being petty, etc).", "INFO: what is a child minder? Like she watches other people's kids for a few hours after school? How many kids?", "NTA you did the right thing obviously.", "NTA. You had no obligation to help her, and as a childcare provider yourself don't you have an obligation as a mandated reporter if a kid is in danger? I don't know if that applies to an illegal daycare operation but, I understand why you did what you did. What if the parents didn't know she wasn't authorized to do what she was doing? It sucks she's struggling so much but, she did the wrong thing.", "INFO: Are these kids from her class that she's watching friends of her twins that she agreed to watch for a while?

But it sounds like she's doing a lot more than that. I mean these are here children's classmates, so they'd be around 6 to. Can you imagine how much of a handful that would be. And I imagine her home isn't properly prepared for that either.\n\nSo that many children, that's just a hazard and a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nSo NTA.", "NTA.\n\nReddit stories are filled with jerkos who stand around making idiotic excuses for miscreants no matter what they do, what laws they break, what lives they mess up.\n\nYour husband is one of them.

Your SIL knowingly broke the law by running an illegal daycare/nanny service without the proper certifications. You took the opportunity to get revenge for how she treated you and your husband in the past by reporting her illegal scheme.

People like your SIL are struggling to live. Your SIL has children and now their mother has zero income. Do you care about THOSE children, or only the ones that she babysits?\n\nYour husband is right. He should be FURIOUS.

You have to abide by regulations and certifications etc and there is a limit on how many children can attend. It's not like a babysitter.", "I think it's less about watching them, and more about  driving them around. Plus she wants it advertised as a business, she was asking OP to promote it. This isn't just bringing one extra kid home for a little extra cash, or a playdate or babysitting. She wants to make this profitable. If you're trying to take care of kids as your business you need to go about it the right way. Not to mention if OP had started promoting it to her clients and something happened, how would that affect her reputation? There are laws when you're in childcare to report illegal activity involving kids. That's what OP did.", "I had 3 sitters that weren\u2019t certified.

But, she wasn't running a full-on business or anything. In fact, we were supposed t obe watched by someone else, but that woman had a full plate and she suggested this woman, so that's how we even ended up with her in the first place haha", "Were they watching groups of unrelated children in their private home? Or just your kid at your home?", "I really wanted to support her for being a single mother but she wanted OP to help drum up her business. If anything happened under her care, the consequences would be huge. She'd lose her own children because of that. NTA I was particularly worried if she was taking on special needs children under her care.", "Groups. I did the same as a kid. My children LOVED their \u201cmain\u201d sitter & she always has a houseful. She made it very clear she was not certified but years of experience & recommendations from people I trust is much more valuable to me than any type of certification. However, pretending to be certified is very different", "OP shouldn\u2019t promote her but as long as the SIL is being transparent there is no need to report her.
