A few comments clarify what a child minder is, and it's not a baby sitter", "It\u2019s not sane. \n\nBut a lot of people do insane things. \n\nco-sleeping, bedding in a bassinet, not vaccinating, daily McDonald\u2019s, in app purchases (that one is a joke) etc.\n\nIf your job is childcare, and you are licensed to care for a certain amount of children and decide to double it, and a baby dies, then you messed up. But the key word is licensed (know what you  are doing).\n\nThe poor kid in the Etsy scenario - his  death isnt necessarily attributable to one specific cause. My point is the carers WERE credentialed. \n\nin this AITA situation, we are talking about (Sil), who is NOT licensed , is scheming, admits she doesn\u2019t have the money to obtain credentials (or much else), is a \u201csingle mom\u201d (which always seem to be an excuse for poor behavior)and is looking to rapidly expand her business. \n\nOP IS licensed, probably a mandatory reporter, and concerned.

There are reasons regulations like this exist, chief among them is safety. You never know people as well as you think you do.", "YTA.  You don\u2019t like your SIL, so were you reporting her out of safety fears, or just being rotten?  If your business is child minding why would your husband need to be a SAHD?  Isn\u2019t the point of child minding to include your own for frugalities sake?  Why not add him as an employee and then it becomes a the family business?", "YTA.", "INFO.\n\nDo the parents who take their kiddies to SIL KNOW she doesn't have her qualifications, and do they understand WHY those qualifications are required?\n\nHow many children is SIL expecting to be able to look after?\n\nIs she doing this in her own home?

There are plenty of shitty certified caretakers. My children\u2019s main caretaker always made me feel as though they were the most important children in the world & my kids LOVED going there.

They aren't certified and so a parent generally is relying on recommendations and also personally viewing to get a sense of whether they want to leave their children there.\n\nThe age of the children - how many children would factor in as to whether it was a safe environment. \n\nIt seems as though OP was driven by some kind of spite to actually report the business. Unless I felt that children were being harmed I wouldn't report an unofficial babysitter - but I am in the USA where it is not uncommon.", "Info\n\nIf you knew she was divorcing and struggling, why was your thought process \u201cI have to stop her!\u201d And not \u201chow can I help her?\u201d\n\nIt reads that you dislike that she does similar work as you, even before you found out about the licensing", "NTA- the kids safety is more important", "I don\u2019t think you were wrong by not promoting her but I think it was wrong to report her.

So it seems she was actually doing it for business and in order to do that there is rules and regulations to follow.
