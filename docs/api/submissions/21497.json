It happens every year Friday Saturday and Sunday but Saturday he needs to go because one special plane will be there. \n\n\nK I need perspective. AITA?\n\nPartner wants to go to this once a year show for his bday. We went last year and the year before. Usually it's a big thing where a bunch of us go. This year it'll just be him. \n\nOriginally his parents were going to join but they do crafts as a hobby and have a craft show that day so they have said they're not going. Then, it was supposed to be both of us going. We hadn't got tickets yet just talked about how we'd go. \n\nThen I got asked to be a bridesmaid in one of my longest friends wedding on the same day as that show. My partner hasn't really spent much time with them but he is invited to the wedding.\n\nI said yes very excited to be her bridesmaid without putting the dates together and how I technically had plans beforehand even though we hadn't bought the tickets yet. \n\nThe event is 3 hours west of us, Friday Saturday Sunday and the wedding is 3 hours east of us on Saturday. I did mention going to the event Sunday instead so we could wedding on Saturday but that wasn't good enough.\n\nNow my partner is pissed because he has to go alone, and I'm pissed because I make a ton of compromises for things that are important for him but it doesn't seem to reciprocate when something is important to me. Plus, he had the option to come to the wedding but has decided not to. (Ps event is not on his actual bday) \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\nI'm pretty hurt because now it's bringing up other issues like how I'm always game for the plans he makes and would definitely be willing to compromise if the tables were turned.\n\nNot to mention this event happens every year. Yes only once but he can go next year and a wedding you can't just attend the following year. \n\nSo now we're in a big argument and I'd love some perspective.

It sounds like what you did was make plans with him, then make conflicting plans, then cancel the plans with him then just informed him after the fact that he could attend this wedding or go to his event alone.

The week before the wedding, hours before my bachelorette party, my husband broke his collarbone at HIS. (Playing paintball, not like, buff strippers lol.) Instead of going to celebrate with my friends, I had to go home to take care of him after he got out of the hospital. \n\nMy friends always said we'd do a makeup party......but first I got pregnant pretty much immediately after getting married, and since then, one of my two best friends ended up in a really bad way and wouldn't be there if we did a do over, and my other best friend DIED of Covid complications when the pandemic first hit. Even if I someday get to have a \"make up\" bachelorette party, two of the people I love the most wouldn't be there, because bad luck and circumstances took away the chance we had. I don't regret being there for my husband, of course, but just like your friend's wedding.....it's not something I can ever get back after missing it.\n\nOn the other hand, my family decided to do a reunion in summer of 2019. It cost us a lot, but we were determined to go. It was the last time the whole family was together, one of my uncles passed away only a few months later and his wife had a major stroke. Because of Covid there would have been no chance for a do over. Again, a once in a lifetime event and I am SO grateful to have those memories and pictures.\n\nDon't let your partner's selfish refusal to bend in the face of something important to you, because you'll never get those memories back, and your feelings and experiences should be and ARE every bit as valid as his.", "Maybe you could have communicated better but that\u2019s splitting hairs imo.

To be clear, I'm all for communicating about things, but there's no point in \"asking\" or \"discussing\" *if* she can change their plans when there's no real alternative (she isn't willing to skip a once-in-a-lifetime wedding event and she shouldn't be willing to do that). What options are there to discuss? The only other option is what else to do for his birthday instead, but nothing in this posts says they won't or can't still do that (make other plans to celebrate another way).\n\nSo I don't think the before/after matters if the end result will be the same. She's being asked to do the honor of participating in a wedding for a close, longtime friend. There's no chance she's skipping this for some kind of annual show.

That won't change anything.\n\nYour original comment is technically correct that he didn't have an opportunity to compromise before she agreed to be in the wedding -- but that's irrelevant because there is no possible compromise there. You can't half be in a wedding or half attend a wedding, unless the times & locations magically work out that she could leave the reception early to go to the show. I think the compromise she's talking about is now: His choice to join her in the wedding or to go to his show alone. Not only is not willing to consider giving up his show for one year, but he's mad at her for choosing the wedding. That's where he's messing up. He still has the opportunity to compromise, but he isn't. (To be clear, I'm not saying he should skip the show -- I don't know enough about his plans and it doesn't sound like he's friends with the wedding couple. Going to the show might be totally valid. But being mad at her that he's going alone is definitely AH behavior; the compromise could be letting her go to her wedding in peace, at a minimum, and he could invite a friend to the show while making different plans with her on his actual birthday.)", "\"I'm not freaking out!

It sounds like a tradition at this point for him to celebrate it by going to this event with his parents and with OP. True it might be an overreaction from his side, but it truly sucks balls to get ditched first by his parents and then by OP. Perhaps he has reasons he definitely wanted to go on Saturday or definitely didn\u2019t want to go on Sunday. It doesn\u2019t make him an AH for expressing his emotions (perhaps not the greatest, smartest and most mature way to express it, but everyone has a different way of handling their emotions and at a different learning point on how to express their emotions). Let him cool down for a bit, and talk about it later when the initial burst of emotion has faded somewhat. It would also perhaps be a good moment to evaluate: is there anything you can help with in these moments of emotional stress? Does he just need time and space to wail / be bummed out? Express how you felt when he had these emotions, and find a solution for the future if anything similar happens again. And if there is truly nothing fruitful coming from that, maybe it\u2019s a good time to evaluate whether this relationship is sustainable. \n\nThe question here though is if OP was an AH. I don\u2019t think so. OP made a very human mistake of double booking in the moment of excitement, tried to compromise and find a solution together with her partner.

Last year at this show I saw an E-4, plus 3 aircraft of the Swedish Air Force Historic Flight that basically never come to the UK - exceptionally rare.\n\nIt probably means little to someone who doesn't follow it, but it could be likened to seeing a musicians final gig perhaps, or a sports star's retirement game. \n\nIt doesn't mean the bf is in the right, but it does put a slightly different spin on things -from his perspective it might be a once in a lifetime thing too.", "Nah.\nHe can still go if he wants.

While it would be nice for her to have her partner at the wedding, it's fair for him to want to do the special thing he really cares about.

She was excited about being asked to be in the wedding and it didn't click that it was the same day.

You deserve to be with someone who is equally kind and generous, and will be happy to be a part of your life and your friends and families lives. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to ask your partner of several years to come to a wedding that you\u2019re a part of. That\u2019s a no-brainer, and you shouldn\u2019t have to explain that to him. \n\nIf you have to explain to someone how obviously selfish their actions are\u2026 they are hopefully a young child, not a grown adult.  Adults should be able to recognize when their actions are selfish. They should feel guilty or shameful about those actions. The fact that he doesn\u2019t feel any guilt or shame, and he\u2019s doubling down on his perspective is very troubling and very selfish.\n\nHe missed some developmental stages many years before you met him.  \n\nIt\u2019s a difficult realization that your current boyfriend will never be able to give you the unselfish love and kindness that you deserve and that most people expect from their lifelong partner.  \n\nA scheduling conflict is one thing.

Not pointing the finger and saying you are completely wrong, but it probably hurt him that it wasn't more important to you to keep plans with him.  It may have been better to discuss it first instead of just telling him this is what you are doing.  If you truly value him and your relationship, decisions like this should be made together. This comes from 12 years of marriage.  It sounds like you both need to think about how you value your relationship and whether you are compatible.  I don't think either of you are an AH, but you do need both need to feel safe communicating your feelings and be willing to  really evaluate together what is acceptable.

You do, being in a relationship means you communicate with your partner. \n\nLike yeah a wedding is important and would take priority over a annual event. However, OP and her BF already had plans and she overrode them without any care or concern that the schedule conflicted with pre established plans and then told her BF that the old ones were cancelled and he can go to the wedding.

It's not a random person asking her to be apart of the biggest day of their life. To be so hellbent on the fact that for one year he can't either go by himself or even support her at this friends wedding, speaks volumes about his character.

That is the reason. Sheesh. Give me a break.", "I don't disagree. I'd go to the wedding too.\n\nIt's just that a lot of people are saying that going to the airshow on Sunday is a perfectly good compromise.
