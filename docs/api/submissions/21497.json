AITA?\n\nPartner wants to go to this once a year show for his bday. We went last year and the year before. Usually it's a big thing where a bunch of us go. This year it'll just be him. \n\nOriginally his parents were going to join but they do crafts as a hobby and have a craft show that day so they have said they're not going. Then, it was supposed to be both of us going. We hadn't got tickets yet just talked about how we'd go. \n\nThen I got asked to be a bridesmaid in one of my longest friends wedding on the same day as that show. My partner hasn't really spent much time with them but he is invited to the wedding.\n\nI said yes very excited to be her bridesmaid without putting the dates together and how I technically had plans beforehand even though we hadn't bought the tickets yet. \n\nNow my partner is pissed because he has to go alone, and I'm pissed because I make a ton of compromises for things that are important for him but it doesn't seem to reciprocate when something is important to me. Plus, he had the option to come to the wedding but has decided not to. (Ps event is not on his actual bday) \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\nI'm pretty hurt because now it's bringing up other issues like how I'm always game for the plans he makes and would definitely be willing to compromise if the tables were turned.\n\nNot to mention this event happens every year. Yes only once but he can go next year and a wedding you can't just attend the following year. \n\nSo now we're in a big argument and I'd love some perspective.

This show happens every year, a wedding is a unique event. \n\nTalk to your partner about it and figure it out. \n\nIf his parents having an arts and crafts event is a good reason to not go then surely a wedding is also a good reason not to go to the show?", "NTA. Being asked to be a part of a wedding is a huge honor. You're not canceling your partner's birthday, just celebrating differently. Compromise goes both ways.", "NTA\n\nYou should be the one annoyed at him for choosing a yearly event over going to one of your good friend's weddings, whether or not he knows her well. It sounds like you've been with him for multiple years so the default expectation should be that he goes with you.", "You're NTA.\n\nBirthday event: every year. \n\nBridesmaid for this friend's Wedding: once in a lifetime (in theory)\n\nYour partner sounds like he believes the sun rises and sets on him.", "This is an annual show that he likes to watch, and comes close to his birthday. It has become a birthday tradition for him to celebrate by watching this show.\n\nYou have close friends who are getting married on that day.\n\nSeems like most couples would automatically chose the wedding. He's not performing in this show, or running it - he just likes watching it every year.\n\nSo he's a bit of a selfish AH, really.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  But it doesn't sound like you two are communicating very well.  It's a tough situation, he has a tradition for his birthday, weddings only happen once.  Just try to have a kind conversation about what everyone needs.  And stop keeping score.", "NTA.\nYou show up for weddings and funerals. \nHe sounds like a bad partner. \n\nYep, sometimes timing is messy. It\u2019s not on his actual bday and no money had been spent.\n\n That he wants to always center himself is a red flag; if he doesn\u2019t have other friends to go with, another flag.", "NTA  since it's not on his actual birthday, also how come he is not getting angry at his parents for going to a craft show instead of that event.  \nAlso your friend's wedding happens once in a lifetime and she chose you as her bridesmaid.\n\nAlso he is invited to the wedding so is not that he has to be alone on the (not)birthday.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve gone to the show with your partner the last two years, it\u2019s not your fault that your friend\u2019s wedding falls on the same day as this year\u2019s show.\n\nThis is your oldest friend\u2019s wedding, and you are a bridesmaid, it\u2019s not just a casual acquaintance\u2019s wedding that you were invited to. Your partner should understand the situation, but instead it sounds like he\u2019s being very immature about it.\n\nGo to the wedding, have fun, enjoy celebrating your friend\u2019s special day. Your partner is invited, he can come if he wants. He doesn\u2019t have to go to the show alone, he\u2019s choosing to.", "NTA\n\nBeing in the wedding party of a close family member or friend takes precedent over drinking faygo at the Gathering of the Juggalos.

NTA.", "NTA - it's one year that you're going to miss this event. You can go every year for the next 20 years. I've never understood people who need to be celebrated every year to this degree.", "NTA- Your friends wedding is a once in a lifetime event and the fact they want you to be a bridesmaid is a big deal!! He\u2019s already gone to the show before and sounds like it\u2019s an annual thing you guys could go to again. I understand why you feel bad because it sucks cancelling but considering the last part of your post he should understand that he should compromise sometimes too. Good luck!", "Most people are saying N T A because you absolutely should go to the wedding.  I agree - you should go to the wedding - but you don't escape being an asshole because of how you handled it.\n\nThe crux of the issue to me is that you didn't even give BF a \\*chance\\* to compromise / be ok with changing plans / any of the other things people are saying he should have done.  It sounds like what you did was make plans with him, then make conflicting plans, then cancel the plans with him then just informed him after the fact that he could attend this wedding or go to his event alone.  So what you gave him the chance to do, really, was just accept you \\*telling\\* him what's going on instead of making it a collaborative effort.\n\nAgain I want to stress that you absolutely should go to the wedding but this was not the way to go about handling this situation without creating some hurt feelings.  I also would avoid telling him that he had the option to go to the wedding as a replacement / positive here.  It's just a thing at this point - not something that helps.  Attending a wedding with someone who is in the wedding party is not a direct analog for whatever you had planned.  Been there, done that, was bored to tears most of the time.  He should attend but don't expect him to see it as 'hey we didn't get to go to this thing we were going to go to but I got to go to this fun wedding!\", that might not be coming.\n\nESH IMO.  BF should be way more willing to let this go and you should not have conducted yourself like you did (in spite of the fact that, again, you absolutely should be attending the wedding).", "NTA.  A wedding should take precedence here especially if you are in the bridal party.  He really should attend with you, as your partner, but if he's going to be a party pooper, leave him at home.\n\nCan't understand the ones thinking yo made a commitment here and it would take precedence over a wedding.  If it was a one time event and they had tickets, perhaps, but its something that has been enjoyed in the past and can be enjoyed in the future.  A wedding is not, especially if you're part of the bridal party.", "NTA\n\nYou all have gone to this plenty of times and this year it didn't work out. Big whoop. He's throwing a temper tantrum by not going to the wedding? Why wouldn't he want to accompany you to the wedding and meet some people and meet your good friend?", "nta.... but at the same time, that event might mean more to him than you think...once something turns into a tradition, it takes on much more meaning, so dont belittle his disapointment either.\n\nHave fun at the wedding,... be supportive even if he goes alone..might not be the situation either of you want.", "NTA, it's not on his actual birthday and he is invited to the wedding", "ESH - \n\nYou suck because you didn't talk to the BF and attempt a compromise before giving a finale Yes to be in the wedding.\n\nYour BF sucks because like many are saying, his event is every year and your longtime friend's wedding is once.  Your actions may have contributed to his position.", "Here's the thing, in my opinion, YTA. \n\nYou made plans with him. Then, without even talking to him, you just said hey those plans are canceled. im doing this now. You didn't even get a chance to compromise. Because you didn't even talk to him. \n\nThat's the issue here.  You made plans and canceled without even a conversation.", "NTA  Every reason you've stated for going to the wedding instead is valid.", "NTA, OP, this is a show that happens once a year, but a wedding is a once in a lifetime event, besides, you might be able to do something special for your partner on a different day, maybe like go out for a nice dinner, or go see a movie, or maybe go on a nice road trip, there are tons of different things you can do together to celebrate his birthday.", "NTA\n\nI may be a little disappointed if I was going to an event by myself but I can actually step back and look at the bigger picture and see that my partner's long time friend is getting married. Even if you weren't a bridesmaid and wanted to attend the wedding as a guest only that should be a non issue.\n\nYour partner sounds petulant.", "His parents bailed for a crafts show and he doesn't seem to have a problem with that.\n\nYou were asked to be a bridesmaid at a wedding (to which he's invited as well). And now he's pissed.\n\nThe event is every year. You can catch the next one.\n\nNTA", "YTA", "Meh. While I do see your side, you'd already made a commitment to your partner. Once you saw the conflicting dates, you should have said to your friend that you were so sorry, but that you'd made a scheduling error. Your partner is right. YTA. Sorry.", "NTA\n\nTime for him to support you like you support him, instead of acting childish about it.  Sometimes plans don't work out.  There's always next year.", "NTA.

She made plans after promising to do something with her partner without a simple conversation first. \n\nImo once she realized the dates she should have talked to her friend and gave her a heads up about the mix-up and then speak to her bf.

I had given suggestions about booking the event the Sunday and doing the drive after the wedding, nope it has to be the Saturday. I had given suggestions but we just felt like everyone ditched him so he didn't want to hear and had the I'll just alone attitude", "If tickets haven't even been purchased and the event is several months away, I would 100% expect my partner to accept the wedding party invitation and tell me about it. If he \"asked\" me about it, that's fine too. But it would be stupid for me to demand we have a \"discussion\" over something that seems pretty common sense to me. A friend's wedding is a bigger deal than a once a year show. I guess potentially the only point of discussion would be planning something else special for my birthday to do on a different day.", "I wouldn't expect my partner to do that, especially if it was my birthday plan. I would hope we can discuss other options to change the plans.  Because this affects me too, not just my partner.  \n\nI wouldn't demand a conversation but I would be upset my partner didn't discuss with me and instead told me this is what their doing I can either join in or do my own thing. \n\nYea she should go to the wedding but she should have talked to her partner not told him. That's the difference imo"]}
