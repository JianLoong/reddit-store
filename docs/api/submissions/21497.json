It happens every year Friday Saturday and Sunday but Saturday he needs to go because one special plane will be there. \n\n\nK I need perspective. AITA?\n\nPartner wants to go to this once a year show for his bday. We went last year and the year before. Usually it's a big thing where a bunch of us go. This year it'll just be him. \n\nOriginally his parents were going to join but they do crafts as a hobby and have a craft show that day so they have said they're not going. Then, it was supposed to be both of us going. We hadn't got tickets yet just talked about how we'd go. \n\nThen I got asked to be a bridesmaid in one of my longest friends wedding on the same day as that show. My partner hasn't really spent much time with them but he is invited to the wedding.\n\nI said yes very excited to be her bridesmaid without putting the dates together and how I technically had plans beforehand even though we hadn't bought the tickets yet. \n\nThe event is 3 hours west of us, Friday Saturday Sunday and the wedding is 3 hours east of us on Saturday. I did mention going to the event Sunday instead so we could wedding on Saturday but that wasn't good enough.\n\nNow my partner is pissed because he has to go alone, and I'm pissed because I make a ton of compromises for things that are important for him but it doesn't seem to reciprocate when something is important to me. Plus, he had the option to come to the wedding but has decided not to. (Ps event is not on his actual bday) \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\nI'm pretty hurt because now it's bringing up other issues like how I'm always game for the plans he makes and would definitely be willing to compromise if the tables were turned.\n\nNot to mention this event happens every year. Yes only once but he can go next year and a wedding you can't just attend the following year. \n\nSo now we're in a big argument and I'd love some perspective.

It sounds like what you did was make plans with him, then make conflicting plans, then cancel the plans with him then just informed him after the fact that he could attend this wedding or go to his event alone.

The week before the wedding, hours before my bachelorette party, my husband broke his collarbone at HIS. (Playing paintball, not like, buff strippers lol.) Instead of going to celebrate with my friends, I had to go home to take care of him after he got out of the hospital. \n\nMy friends always said we'd do a makeup party......but first I got pregnant pretty much immediately after getting married, and since then, one of my two best friends ended up in a really bad way and wouldn't be there if we did a do over, and my other best friend DIED of Covid complications when the pandemic first hit. Even if I someday get to have a \"make up\" bachelorette party, two of the people I love the most wouldn't be there, because bad luck and circumstances took away the chance we had. I don't regret being there for my husband, of course, but just like your friend's wedding.....it's not something I can ever get back after missing it.\n\nOn the other hand, my family decided to do a reunion in summer of 2019. It cost us a lot, but we were determined to go. It was the last time the whole family was together, one of my uncles passed away only a few months later and his wife had a major stroke. Because of Covid there would have been no chance for a do over. Again, a once in a lifetime event and I am SO grateful to have those memories and pictures.\n\nDon't let your partner's selfish refusal to bend in the face of something important to you, because you'll never get those memories back, and your feelings and experiences should be and ARE every bit as valid as his.", "Maybe you could have communicated better but that\u2019s splitting hairs imo.

No purchase of tickets, or booking hotels etc. She even commented that later she suggested still going to the event just a day later and he was having NONE of it. \n\nHe can complain and be hurt and sad and disappointed all he wants. But he needs to grow up and realize that everyone is growing up (idk ages aren't included buy I'm assuming their in their mid to late 20s) and other things can take priority and it's not the end of the world.

He just had dropped in his lap that his already busted plans were now \\*completely\\* busted.  It's entirely unfair to expect him to just plaster on a smile and pretend this didn't bother him.  We can quibble about how much it bothered him but he has the right to be upset here, even if he's gone over the top now.  Acting like he doesn't or trying to control his level of upset for him is...well unfair was the right description.", "This reinforces ESH for me - you planned one thing and double booked, which happens and it doesn't sound like theres much compromise towards his birthday plans besides him celebrating alone.

To be clear, I'm all for communicating about things, but there's no point in \"asking\" or \"discussing\" *if* she can change their plans when there's no real alternative (she isn't willing to skip a once-in-a-lifetime wedding event and she shouldn't be willing to do that). What options are there to discuss? The only other option is what else to do for his birthday instead, but nothing in this posts says they won't or can't still do that (make other plans to celebrate another way).\n\nSo I don't think the before/after matters if the end result will be the same. She's being asked to do the honor of participating in a wedding for a close, longtime friend. There's no chance she's skipping this for some kind of annual show. So why even allow the discussion ahead of time? So he can be an extra AH and ask her not to go to the wedding? That won't change anything.\n\nYour original comment is technically correct that he didn't have an opportunity to compromise before she agreed to be in the wedding -- but that's irrelevant because there is no possible compromise there. You can't half be in a wedding or half attend a wedding, unless the times & locations magically work out that she could leave the reception early to go to the show. I think the compromise she's talking about is now: His choice to join her in the wedding or to go to his show alone. Not only is not willing to consider giving up his show for one year, but he's mad at her for choosing the wedding. That's where he's messing up. He still has the opportunity to compromise, but he isn't. (To be clear, I'm not saying he should skip the show -- I don't know enough about his plans and it doesn't sound like he's friends with the wedding couple. Going to the show might be totally valid. But being mad at her that he's going alone is definitely AH behavior; the compromise could be letting her go to her wedding in peace, at a minimum, and he could invite a friend to the show while making different plans with her on his actual birthday.)", "\"I'm not freaking out! I just refuse to change what I want and if I have to I'll drive 3 hours to hang out with myself!\"", "What is his reasons for not wanting to go on Sunday?

Not even a real compromise.", "Add that info to your main post", "Is it the Oregon country fair?", "I agree with you - but that's a long drive after the wedding.  You're going to be out late Saturday night for the wedding - celebrating with old friends.  Then you're gonna wake up and drive 6 hours (tired?  hungover?) to get to the show.  It's not in your hometown, so you're gross from the car ride.  And it's a sunday - do you have to work on Monday?  You're both going to be exhausted by the time you get home (late sunday night?  Monday?) \n\nI agree it's a valid and good compromise - but it's gonna be a loooong weekend to pull off both.", "Without knowing the event, there could be reasons why he only wants to go Saturday. If the event has artists, maybe the artist he wants to see is only there Saturday.\n\nI agree that it\u2019s a ESH situation.", "It is still an asshole move to completely forget making plans for your partner's birthday and agreeing that both you and your partner will then attend a different event at the same time.", "INFO I've seen a few people asking and am also curious, what kind of event is this? Is this something like a music festival where the event would be different every night of the weekend or more like a showcase thing where the event would be consistently the same all three days?\n\nAs an aside I still say regardless the wedding is obviously the more important event but this could give context to his attitude on the compromise.", "Would you be up to a 6 hour drive, one way there only to have a 3 hour drive home after?

But this is his birthday celebration they planned in advance on a day she knows no one else will be there for him.

This was after everybody else said they couldn't make it that day. Instead of going Friday or Sunday when everybody else could make it, he dug his heels in and refused to budge. It has to be Saturday or nothing for no reason other than it being his birthday and he gets to decide everything.\n\nOP made an understandable mistake and offered a perfectly reasonable compromise which was refused because he wouldn't get his way.
