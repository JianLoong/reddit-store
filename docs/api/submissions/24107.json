{"id": 24107, "submission_id": "15ksgeb", "title": "AITA for refusing to babysit for my best friend?", "selftext": "Throwaway for privacy. \n\nI (28F) and Mia (34F) have been best friends for 11 years. I love her like a sister and until now we've never fallen out. Neither of us have family close by or a wide circle of friends, so I really want to try and resolve this issue as best I can. \n\nAbout 5 years ago, Mia told me that if she hadn't met a man by the time she turned 35 then she would go the sperm donor route and become a single mother. That time has now arrived so she's planning on starting the IVF process and getting pregnant next year. I fully support her decision and think she'll make an incredible parent, with or without a partner. \n\nThe problem started a couple of months ago when she casually mentioned over dinner that her future baby will love spending time with their Aunty OP. I laughed and reminded her I've never had any maternal instincts, so the three of us will need to hang out as a trio because I'll be new to being an Aunty. She asked what I meant, so I clarified I wouldn't be babysitting as I'm not comfortable being responsible for small children on my own, but I would happily spend time with both of them together. Mia went quiet and then moved the conversation along so I didn't think much else of it. \n\nFast forward to yesterday when we were in her car and Mia unexpectedly launches in a story about her friend in Spain who also used a sperm donor to become a single mother and her friendship circle have been helping look after the baby so she can continue building her career. Mia then said \"having a strong female support network is so important when raising children, I love that we would do anything for each other\". I noticed she was putting a big emphasis on childcare so again, I reminded her I wouldn't be able to babysit, but was quick to let her know I would support in any other way I could. I told her I could cook, clean, keep her company, be at the hospital, buy her child whatever they need. Anything outside of babysitting solo. She laughed and said \"it's so funny you have no idea how much you're going to love this baby, you'll enjoy taking care of your godchild more than you realize!\". Alarm bells were going off so I admittedly took a blunt tone and told her it's not going to be my kid, it's hers and I'm not comfortable with the responsibility of looking after a baby on my own (I have sensory issues and anxiety, screaming kids make me panic in a big way). I'm not doing it and I'm not changing my mind. She looked genuinely hurt and said most people would do anything to help out a single mum and she couldn't understand why I wouldn't want to do this for her. She also said it's \"worrying and abnormal\" for me to be so nervous about looking after a baby, and mentioned she doesn't have anyone else to help so this has come as a horrible surprise.\n\nShe dropped me home and we haven't spoken since.

She has not thought her decision through at all, and is an asshole for trying to pressure you into helping her raise a child.", "NTA but you could lose the friendship. Don't give in though. I am in the same boat, bad sensory issues, hell I avoid small kids even with parents around. You should not push yourself out of your comfort zone for her. She sounds determined though, and you might lose her. That sucks, but if she can't understand your boundaries she isn't a good friend anyway. If she doesn't apologize and come around in a few days I wouldn't trust her not to spring it up on you again when the baby's born. She needs to clearly realize and accept your boundaries soon. If she doesn't you really should spare yourself the torment of a future entitled parent.", "NTA\n\nShe's the one making this decision being single.  If she can't do it on her own or has other family or friends around, then maybe she shouldn't do it. It's not like you're judging her decisions.  She should know you well enough to know how you feel about babies.  If she keeps pushing this, it may just push you away completely.", "NTA. It\u2019s much better you are having this conversation NOW so she can change her expectations BEFORE she gets pregnant. She sounds like she almost wants to raise this child with you as a partner vs an aunt/godmother type. If she is worried about not having a support system to help with childcare then she needs to consider saving more for daycare/nanny costs and/or moving to be closer to family who might want to be more involved. It\u2019s not fair of her to expect you to change your lifestyle just because she decided she wants to be a parent.", "NTA\n\nI think she's obviously feeling anxious about being a single mother without a deep support network, but she's really not entitled to your caring for her child.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA\n\n>her friend in Spain who also used a sperm donor to become a single mother and her friendship circle have been helping look after the baby so she can continue building her career. \n\nI've been in friendship/work support circles where members of the group looked out for each other and helped each other in various ways with regards to certain duties and scheduling. *But* it takes time to build such relationships and a network, it has to be mutually beneficial for all members, and it has to be voluntary. You can't just tell someone they're now your support network and gonna do X, Y, and Z for you lol", "NTA, NTA, NTA.  Your friend never intended to become a single parent, she has been planning for you to become a parent right along with her.  The fact that you are not willing to do that should not come as a horrible surprise to her.  Someone needs to inform her that a single parent is just that, a person raising a child alone.  \n\nIn my opinion, to intentionally plan on becoming a single parent does not warrant the same consideration as someone who inadvertently finds themselves in that situation.", "NTA. One for the things they tell you when you decide to pursue solo motherhood (that\u2019s what it\u2019s called when it\u2019s on purpose) is to have a strong support network. So I understand where she\u2019s coming from but you\u2019re not an asshole for declining to watch her child.", "NTA. She's seriously delusional for thinking that other people should bear the burden of her life choices. I don't care how good of a friend you guys may be this is out of line", "NTA. Who plans on having a kid alone and plans on using someone else as their primary support that is not involved in the decision to have the kid. I honestly think it is selfish to plan to bring a kid into this world when so little thought has been given to it. This applies to natural births, but even more so for artificial insemination which cannot by definition happen by ''accident''", "NTA. If she doesn\u2019t have things like childcare sorted out without attempting to force someone into it then she probably should take a little more time before having a baby. You are not responsible for a child that she brings into the world and it\u2019s unfair of her to expect you to babysit especially when you\u2019ve plainly and repeatedly told her you aren\u2019t comfortable doing it", "NTA\n\nRun fam. Not only she is delusional, but she's also having a mid-live crisis for not finding a man and has now chosen to become a single-mother. \n\nAnd now she is trying to coerce you in to providing free childcare?\n\nRed flags everywhere - run far away.", "NTA. No is a complete sentence. This is a hill to die on. This will be her child, not yours. You do not owe her childcare. If she doesn't get this you need to go LC/NC.", "NTA. With this sequence of conversations she was definitely planning to make you a part time parent after the baby was born.\n\nYou are absolutely within your rights to set her straight on the matter and please dismiss her gaslighting for the manipulative tantrum that it is.", "Single mother here tapping in to say you have done everything right. Your friend is deluded and you asserting your firm boundaries now, will help both of you long term. She doesn\u2019t want to be a single parent, she wants to be a parent that has a chance to offload when she needs it. She wants to meet a need to have a child and have a partnership and has inappropriately tried to make you the other end of the partnership so she can have everything she wants without regard to reality or decency. It wasn\u2019t my choice to be a single parent, it\u2019s what I have to do to keep us safe,  and it\u2019s still the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me but I would NEVER dump parenting on my friends so as I could live out a fantasy and ignore the responsibilities. NTA", "NTA and practice saying NO and sticking to it, she's making plans for you without your input.", "NTA Good grief, you aren't her spouse, partner or nanny. She is making the choice to have a child, and it's HER responsibility to care for it and/or find others to help out. You have already told her no, and she needs to accept that. She is acting really selfish and entitled.", "NTA.\n\nSingle people can often have high expectations of other people caring for their kid. And if she doesn't have anyone else to help then she is setting herself up for major failure as you've been clear with your boundaries. I don't doubt she will keep pushing them, too, so hold your ground.\n\nYou aren't a bad friend for not wanting to, and she is a bad friend if she's going to try to coerce you. I think she's realizing her dream is a rough reality and may be freaking out as she realizes how few options she actually has by going this route.", "Aarrrgg i hate people that do that. It was done to me to. Just because she has this romantic fantasy about having a baby and all her friends stepping up like it\u2019s their baby to in a way. Doesn\u2019t mean that is reality. You have your own life and dreams.", "NTA\n\nShe's amazingly self entitled to think that she can choose to become a single parent and make her friends  bear the responsibility that comes with it.", "I\u2019m 42f, have two kids, a stepson and several nieces and nephews. So I actually have experience with young children, but you couldn\u2019t pay me to watch young children anymore. All do the kids in my life are 9 and up. I don\u2019t blame you at all and she shouldn\u2019t be calling you weird or getting upset. It\u2019s her child, not yours. You know your limits and you should stick to them. NTA.", "NTA - in fact, quite the opposite for making sure your point was so clear. \n\n>er friend in Spain who also used a sperm donor to become a single mother and her friendship circle have been helping look after the baby so she can continue building her career.\n\n>she doesn't have anyone else to help so this has come as a horrible surprise.\n\nHaving a friend group who can rally is totally different from only having one friend who can help. She's basically planning for you to be the other parent without wanting to give you a say.\n\nThere's also a big difference to me between friends rallying around someone who became a single mom not by choice, vs someone going into motherhood as a single mom who expects their friends to just do for them.", "NTA\n\nShe is hugely mistaken. Being a single mom does not automatically entitled her to \"everything\" from everyone.", "My friend just gave birth and said the same and I said the same as you. Stick to your guts. NTA", "NTA. How unbelievably entitled of your friend.", "NTA. You stated boundaries politely and there is nothing wrong with that. It is perfectly fine that you don't have a maternal instinct, and you shouldn't be made to feel guilty for that.\n\nAlso, she isn't thinking this through. I wouldn't want to leave my child unattended with someone who didn't feel comfortable looking after them. That's a recipe for a stressed friend and baby, presuming nothing worse goes wrong because the friend has been forced in a position that's out of their depth.", "Absolutely NTA. Mia is deliberately planning on bringing a child into the world as a single parent who will have to continue to work to provide for her child. Part of the planning she needs to do is to make sure her financial planning includes a nanny or adjusting her work/career hours to fit with the daycare options in your area. It's extreme presumptuous and entitled behavior to expect that you or anyone else will adjust *your* work schedule or give up huge chunks of your non-working hours to coparent her child. \n\nIt's certainly possible that once baby arrives, you'll find that you do actually like spending time with the little person and enjoy occasional babysitting. It's equally possible that you won't. Either way, it's up to you to *offer* to babysit *if* you are willing and able to do so, not for your friend to demand it.", "NTA even if you loved kids you aren\u2019t a nanny. She makes it sound like she is being forced to have this child as a single mom and thus you have to help her. While I have the utmost respect for single parents, the single aspect is usually based out of something negative, the other bio parent doesn\u2019t want to be involved or even a widow/er situation and that parent picks themselves up and takes care of their child. In this case your friend just decided she wants to have a kid which good for her but you are not obligated to her or this child.", "NTA. I know what you mean because I\u2019m a woman who never had any maternal instincts either and I\u2019ve been judged for it just like Mia is doing to you. Stand your ground and tell her how much her attitude hurts you. She has the idea that she\u2019s the star of the show as a new mum and she\u2019s not thinking about her best friend\u2019s rights or feelings.", "NTA, whilst I can appreciate her wanting a child. It's incredibly irresponsible to have one under the assumption that others will pick up the slack. This is an obvious NTA.", "NTA this entitled mindset is too common, especially with grandparents. \u201cOh yeah btw I decided to have a child and they\u2019re on the way. You\u2019ll be providing countless hours of free childcare and will be happy about it!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s nice for her to want to live her dream but that doesn\u2019t mean she can just dump her future child on unwilling people.\n\n> She\u2026said most people would do anything to help out a single mum\n\n\u201cOk good. Go bother one of them then.\u201d", "nta.  from the sound of it, she wants you to be a partner in raising this kid that's not yours.  screw that.", "NTA. She is choosing to be a single mom. It is a very hard thing to do by yourself and while friends helping is great, she needs to assume she is on her own and be grateful for any help her friends choose to offer.", "NTA Firstly \"most people\" do nto do anything they can for single mothers,  I know I've been one. Secondly,  your friend seems to be entering into this thinking you ade going to be an extra parent to their child and that's obviously not acceptable to you. This isn't your baby (or anyones baby yet)  and it isn't your responsibility. You don't have to babysit for her.", "NTA. She\u2019s delusional if she thinks she\u2019s entitled to all her friends caring for a child SHE IS CHOOSING TO HAVE.", "NTA. If she can't take care of a child, she shouldn't have one. Playing the single card here I see and expecting you to pick up the slack. Nope.", "NTA your friend made a lot of assumptions about what other people would do for her.", "NTA That's a cute anecdote of how it's going for her friend in Spain, but I'm sorry....in what world would \"most people do anything to help out a single mum\". All you have to is talk to more than one single mother to know how little help and support they often receive. Your friend has created a fantasy world in her head and now expects you to live in it.", "NTA.  If she doesn\u2019t *currently* have anyone else to help raise her baby as a single mom, then she needs to expand that circle ASAP!", "NTA and you get to say NO not only bc you are nervous to be responsible for a child on your own, but also because you plain don't want to and also bc you remain childfree regardless of whatever delusional plan she's concocted.", "NTA - not your baby, not your responsibility. You have made your boundary clear.", "NTA. She says \"most people would do anything to help out a single mum.\" But first, she's choosing to be a single mum, which is different from a woman who gets divorced or whose partner abandons her and may need temporary help while she regains her footing. She's planning a life where you are the de facto babysitter, which isn't the same as lending a hand from time to time. And second, she talks about \"a strong female support network,\" but she seems to mean...you. And third, did she ask you if you were willing to be the godparent? This sounds like she's trying the rare stunt of baby-trapping a friend. Don't let her do this to you.", "NTA.  My best friend's sister did IVF to be a single mom.  She ended up with twins.  My best friend (who has two grown children) has emphatically stood by that she is not a babysitter for his sister's life choice.  Due to circumstances, they all live together now and my best friend still doesn't babysit/provide childcare.  Your boundaries are valid, reasonable, and best of all... enforceable.", "She sounds like one of those people that get a puppy and then let it shit all over because they only wanted it to be cute and have no plan on actually training it. The way she dropped her friend still being able to \"build her career\" gives me her expecting a full-time nanny from op, i.e. she shows up for the photo op, then bails.", "More of a co parenting bff thing", "NTA", "Exactly. I was reading and kept thinking. \"I'm sorry. Make this make sense to me.\"", "All her friends? It seems OP is the closest friend within a very small circle of friends. She\u2019s going to rely heavily on OP weather OP likes it or not.\n\nThe good thing is the friend is not pregnant yet.", "Right? That one blew my mind! We constantly see posts in here about entitled mother's pulling the same thing just because they had a child! Ridiculous"]}
