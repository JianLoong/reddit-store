Now my grandma who\u2019s the head of the family did everything she can to persuade me to study law or be a doctor at least. Things didn\u2019t go her plan so as I was going through uni, our relationship fell apart. On her Nth birthday, she invited everyone to her party except me. How did I know I was not invited? Everyone got a paper invitation with their name on it. I didn\u2019t receive one, but my brother did. He was even asked to make a speech. I only found out that I was not invited because my cousin asked me if I had something to wear for my grandma\u2019s birthday.\n\nAnother instance of my grandma\u2019s resentment towards me, when I graduated uni from this prestigious school, she posted on my facebook \u201cCongrats! At least you graduated.\u201d I studied hospitality so it\u2019s far from Law. Throughout the years, our relationship was non-existent. I moved to Australia since I got a scholarship to study my Master\u2019s degree. When I graduated this time, she posted on my facebook again for the whole internet to see \u201cCongrats for getting your degree in Australia\u201d. I cut my ties with her after that. Never saw her again, did not even talk to her since that day.\n\nNow to the present, I got a message from my cousin asking me to send a video birthday greeting for our grandma which I automatically refused. She asked why to which i answered because she\u2019s belittled me all these years. I got the response \u201cwell, if you listened to her, she wouldn\u2019t have said what she said. Just say \u2018happy birthday, I love you\u2019 and it\u2019ll be over\u201d.

If OP can make a life that's decent without becoming a doctor or lawyer and kowtowing to grandma, that means the other cousins who didn't want to become lawyers or doctors didn't have to start working a field they hated after grueling extra years of expensive schooling. Then they'd start to question it and this fragile facade would crumble into dust and they'd have to confront the fact that they hate a significant portion of their daily lives. Then they'd try to blame grandma, but internally would hate themselves for not having a spine like OP and doing what they wanted to.\n\nMuch easier just to try and get her to record a happy birthday message, admittedly.\n\nNTA OP, your cousin and grandma (and possibly more of the rest of your fam) sound like elitist AHs.
