But she also has to respect your decision to decline her invitation. You're well within your rights to not go because she hasn't invited your family but has invited her mothers.\n\nIt sounds like your daughter has a lot of issues surrounding your and your ex-wife's separation. She's making choices around those issues and those choices have consequences. She can't have her cake and eat it too.", "INFO: why is she ok with her mom\u2019s new partner but not yours?", "NTA.

If your daughter rescinds the invitation then that's her choice.", "NTA - based on the facts presented, the fact that she invited her mom\u2019s boyfriend and his kids, clearly indicates that she isn\u2019t attempting to avoid drama and only inviting her birth parents.  Rather, she has invited her mom\u2019s new family and specifically excluded yours.  Since you have attempted to explain this and she drew the line in the sand, your decision to support your wife and kids is the correct one.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou don't invite one half of a married couple to your wedding.

(And truly, if someone is engaged, living with a partner, or otherwise in a long-term relationship, you should invite those significant others, too.)\n\nSince your daughter is an adult, and about to be married herself, someone needs to tell her that. It just isn't done. If someone is important to you, but you don't like their spouse, you hold your nose, and invite the spouse, too.\n\nSome adult kids legitimately don't know this. When my kid got married last year, they didn't. They were trying to cut down the guest list, and didn't think they had to invite a relative's spouse, since they didn't know that spouse, until I set them straight.\n\nMaybe you can approach it like that with your daughter -- as a matter of etiquette?\n\nAs to your small children, is their age perhaps an issue? (How old are they?)\n\nLots of people don't invite children to weddings, or there will be an age minimum for guests. Now, often, people make exceptions for close family, but if your daughter is not close to her half-siblings, I can see where she might not be enthusiastic about inviting little ones.\n\nAre you helping financially, with the wedding?

Can you talk to her about any of this?", "NTA - If the wedding were child-free, I could understand not inviting your younger children, but that is clearly not the case.  If your ex didn't get the plus one of her current SO, again I would understand, but that is not the case.  Your daughter has essentially said \"Mom is allowed to have a new life and family, but you are not.\"  For all those who talk about the damage to the relationship if you don't go, they should think about the damage your grown ass daughter is doing all by herself.  You are not there to be her emotional punching bag and puppet.  Attending the wedding without your family simply says that you allow her to dictate your life and disrespect your current family.  She doesn't have the right to do that unless you give it to her.", "NTA - That \"freedom\" she mentions goes both ways...

You\u2019re absolutely within your right to decline to attend! It\u2019s an invitation, not a summons.

They lose the relationships they previously had with both parents and then have to take on a package deal relationship with strangers. \nWhy is it expected that kids who are already going through an emotional minefield that they are not equipped to deal with.

OP got remarried first and it sounds like the daughter hated the new and \"permanent\" block to her parents getting back together. She's taking that out on OP and his new wife and children. She basically issued an ultimatum and is upset that her father want disrespect his current wife and children.\n\nWithout information of negligence, toxicity, abandonment etc this is about all that can be said.", "> I think ESH, while your daughter should have invited your wife and children, you literally just told her that they matter more to you than she does by saying you won\u2019t attend the wedding.\n\nDaughter is TA for playing the pick-me game, and has only herself to blame if she isn't chosen.", "all my children matter the exact same amount. that's the point here", "But his daughter does seem to have decided that her mother's bf and sons are accepted into her family, while snubbing his WIFE and her step sister.", ">things will go back to the way they were\n\nExcept she is inviting her mother's bf and his sons. But not inviting her father's WIFE and children. So she can't be expecting her parents to get back together or even present a delusion where they are still together.", "Read the OP's follow up comments", "And if he does go then it kind of looks like his younger child is less important than her, not to mention his wife. NAH", "where did I state that my daughter was kicked to the curb? it'r really low to spread lies about someone you don't even know.", "All over again? He meet his wife 4 years after the divorce that the mother initiated, because she fell out of love. How exactly did he chose his new family over her?", "I disagree. If it was a situation where dad and \u201chis other family\u201d were mean and rude and didn\u2019t try to build a relationship then it would make sense. But he stated his other family tried to build relationships with the daughter and she refused. But instead is being petty and inviting mom and boyfriend. So it\u2019s rude and petty to invite moms bf but not dads wife. I wouldn\u2019t have came either.", "His other kids are his daughter's siblings (half-siblings). They are her family. She hasn't accepted them. That said, lots of people have adults only weddings. I've never seen that limit applying to immediate family, but I think it's more of a grey area, depending upon their ages.", "Or the daughter is blaming the father for the divorce. I don't know if he is to blame or not. I dont see that information listed. As she clearly doesn't have any issue with her mother and her boyfriend coming. This may have been understandable at 17 to feel this way but clearly she hasn't matured enough to move past that her father remarried someone that isn't her mother.", "Serious question: what does be the \"bigger person\" even mean? Because every time I read \"be the bigger person,\" what the person is really asking is \"can't you just lay down and let the other guy walk all over you on this.\"", "I\u2019m going to respectfully disagree. She\u2019s totally okay with mom\u2019s BF and his kids attending, so why is she just against dad having moved on?  He met his curry wife 4 years after the divorce, so it\u2019s not like he cheated. \n\nDaughter is being a hypocrite and OP has every right to decline.", "She is in the wrong (probably - we\u2019re missing a lot by necessity), but life is long.  She may grow to see that she was wrong, but not if you don\u2019t go. \nIf OP wants to keep the door open for a future relationship, this is the way - OP and OPs spouse would need to agree that this is the least-harm option (the other children being under 10 are likely to take their cues on graciousness here from the parents). How sad though.  I\u2019m sorry.", "replacement family? you know you are talking about actual human beings right?", "I think you might have some stuff to work through. We need more info before jumping to this conclusion.", "Yes he did leave the family. Not the mother who initiated the divorce because she didn't love him anymore. And he did leave them for then to wait 4 years to meet a new younger woman. /S", "You clearly haven\u2019t actually read OPs posts explaining", "Because let's not forget, parents are real humans with feelings anymore. Daughter is an adult who has made an adult decision, she can deal with the consequences.", "If you don\u2019t tell her the details your daughter is going to fill in her own. Or your ex will do it for you, and probably not honestly. By not being honest with her growing up you did her a disservice.", "amazing. The number of people on the board automatically assume  the male is the reason for divorce.. and any separation with the children.   I would have done the same due to a possible repeat performance. Personally...if my present family wasn't invited, i would not go. Life is messy, character is how you deal with it.", "Nice movie you wrote yourself there", "Not the case at all. OP. has elaborated that the mother was the cause of the divorce", "And your ex-wife finding someone else isn't the same thing? Either your ex-wife is/was pouring poison in your daughter's ear or your daughter has some serious issues and your ex-wife isn't doing anything to help the situation. You should really talk to your ex-wife, sounds like your daughter only listens to her.", "She your daughter ever explain why she was ok with your ex moving on but not you?", "Info: How old are you? How old is your wife?", "You said that in your original post. Can you shine a little more light on it? I mean, I understand a teenager fantasizing that the folks will get back together, but by 27, she ought to have let go of that dream (particularly since you did remarry, and her mother also has a significant other).\n\nI'm asking, because honestly, your daughter's attitude only makes sense to me if you left your first wife, for your second wife. But in your post, you say you met your new wife four years after the divorce.", "There's more to the story, especially if she invited her mother's boyfriend and his children. Something tells me there's more going on between your wife and your daughter than you want to put out here. Is there something more that paints your wife into a bad light that you don't want us to know?", "I dunno by telling your daughter you can't come because your family isn't invited seems like a relationship defining statement, you told her she isn't your family. All because of a party.", "You are going to permanently damage your relationship with your daughter if you don't go, even if she is being unreasonable. Maybe that's worth it to you, but it's something to consider.", "They obviously don't.", "No, the point is that you are now telling your daughter that she is less important than her! You can\u2019t put your daughter first for one day.", "Obviously not.", "Damn - missed that part.  Upgrade my reaction to 100% TA, then.  Straight up disrespecting the step-family.", "She feels as if she was kicked to the curb. You divorced her mom when she was a young teen and then when she was just about an adult, likely looking at colleges and graduation, you remarried and started a new family. She has had issues with your new wife and now often do you spend one on one time with her? The person above said FEELS and didn\u2019t attack you dude.", "You said that you are taking this position for \"your family,\" not acknowledging your daughter as your family also. Your daughter (and brides in general) is tasked with navigation of a truly complicated planning process and pressure to have a perfect day. It's not about you. You came here for judgment and you pleaded your case, and now you're arguing against your own words. I understand why your daughter doesn't feel like you are putting her first this time. You're not. YTA", "Be the bigger person here meaning.   \nOP is probably correct in that his daughter SHOULD let his new wife and family come to her wedding.   \nBut its HER wedding is OP willing to miss one of the biggest life events of his daughter because she SHOULDN'T have these issues?   \n\n\nIn my mind its a small sacrifice on the part of OP for a significant gain.", "I'm fully aware yeah. \n\nBut I also know when someone gets a divorce, remarries, and starts having children with their new spouse 4/5 times they completely and totally forget about the children they already had. If that's what you did, your daughter is 110% justified in not inviting her replacements.", "It\u2019s Reddit, we never get the full story.

You don't want to burden them with adult problems but it also creates an opportunity if one of the parents decides to do that anyway.  \n\nIt looks like OP tried to take the high road and keep his daughter out of the fray, but the ex decided it was OK to not tell her daughter the truth about who initiated the divorce and instead make an issue of OP not wanting to reconcile.\n\nIt's a shame that mom's decisions have resulted in this wedge between OP and his daughter.
