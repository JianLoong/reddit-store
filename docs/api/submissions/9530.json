But she also has to respect your decision to decline her invitation. You're well within your rights to not go because she hasn't invited your family but has invited her mothers.\n\nIt sounds like your daughter has a lot of issues surrounding your and your ex-wife's separation. She's making choices around those issues and those choices have consequences. She can't have her cake and eat it too.", "INFO: why is she ok with her mom\u2019s new partner but not yours?", "NTA.

Rather, she has invited her mom\u2019s new family and specifically excluded yours.  Since you have attempted to explain this and she drew the line in the sand, your decision to support your wife and kids is the correct one.

(And truly, if someone is engaged, living with a partner, or otherwise in a long-term relationship, you should invite those significant others, too.)\n\nSince your daughter is an adult, and about to be married herself, someone needs to tell her that. It just isn't done. If someone is important to you, but you don't like their spouse, you hold your nose, and invite the spouse, too.\n\nSome adult kids legitimately don't know this. When my kid got married last year, they didn't. They were trying to cut down the guest list, and didn't think they had to invite a relative's spouse, since they didn't know that spouse, until I set them straight.\n\nMaybe you can approach it like that with your daughter -- as a matter of etiquette?\n\nAs to your small children, is their age perhaps an issue? (How old are they?)\n\nLots of people don't invite children to weddings, or there will be an age minimum for guests. Now, often, people make exceptions for close family, but if your daughter is not close to her half-siblings, I can see where she might not be enthusiastic about inviting little ones.\n\nAre you helping financially, with the wedding?

Can you talk to her about any of this?", "NTA - If the wedding were child-free, I could understand not inviting your younger children, but that is clearly not the case.  If your ex didn't get the plus one of her current SO, again I would understand, but that is not the case.  Your daughter has essentially said \"Mom is allowed to have a new life and family, but you are not.\"  For all those who talk about the damage to the relationship if you don't go, they should think about the damage your grown ass daughter is doing all by herself.  You are not there to be her emotional punching bag and puppet.  Attending the wedding without your family simply says that you allow her to dictate your life and disrespect your current family.  She doesn't have the right to do that unless you give it to her.", "NTA - That \"freedom\" she mentions goes both ways...

You\u2019re absolutely within your right to decline to attend! It\u2019s an invitation, not a summons.

Why can't you designate one day a month to having dinner or lunch just with your daughter and maintain a relationship? \n\n\nThis is the problem with children of divorce. They lose the relationships they previously had with both parents and then have to take on a package deal relationship with strangers. \nWhy is it expected that kids who are already going through an emotional minefield that they are not equipped to deal with.

You need to have a few, frank, discussions with your daughter telling her what you told internet strangers what happened according to you. \n\nBy not telling her what is happening from YOUR perspective in an age appropriate way you have created this situation for yourself.

Age appropriate honesty is what you should have given to her back then.", "This is just an opinion based on what you've been able to post. Were I in your shoes, there would be a deep feeling of disrespect. Although we always love our children, we may not always like them as a person in a situation. This is that situation. By only inviting you and expecting you walk her down the aisle, she's shown disrespect to you, your wife and her siblings. She's made it abundantly clear that your role at her wedding is for pride and selfishness, expressing the reason she is bothered by your non-attendance is that she won't have her father walk her on her special day.  \n\n\nIt's not for love of you, or your relationship as others have reiterated already and you are under no obligation to do performance duty. She's created a situation where love and affection is transactional, she's willing to be your daughter only on her terms and without regard to your feelings as a person. If we were to reverse roles, and it was the parent who was doing this to their child, Reddit's advice would be to cut ties because this behavior is toxic.   \n\n\nAt 27 your daughter is more than capable of comprehending that her parent's marriage did not work out, and she is now using her wedding as a way to hurt your wife, cause strife in your marriage, and embarrass YOU.

Excluded from celebrations, meeting future grand children, birthday parties, etc etc. There will be other fights and tantrums to get you to conform to these rules of exclusion.   \n\n\nIF you DONT go, the relationship between your daughter and you will sustain damage, and it might never be repairable.  \n\n\nSince this is a lose-lose scenario, my advice is simply to ask, what do you feel is best for you, your wife, and your other two children? How do you want to spend the next 30 years?", "She probably does resent you for moving on, or at least moving on first. You are technically NTA for not accepting the invitation BUT actions have consequences.

At the end of the day though this is your family, and sometimes it is better to be the bigger person, even when you\u2019re right and she\u2019s wrong. Weddings (and funerals) carry an enormous emotional weight. If you skip it there me be no coming back. She doesn\u2019t like your new family. She doesn\u2019t consider them part of her family. She may come around as she grows and mature\u2019s, or not. She may never have the relationship with them that you would like. You should make your peace with that, because if you try to force it, that will ruin your relationship with her.

You understand she'd feel humiliated if you didn't, and that honestly, you'd feel terrible if you didn't, too.\n\nBut then tell her, by the same token, you feel humiliated that she is not inviting your wife. It's a thing that is just not done. It goes beyond rude. It is spiteful.\n\nAre your parents alive? Do you have siblings that have a decent aunt-uncle relationship with your daughter? Can anyone plead your case? Would your ex-wife be your ally, here? How about the ex-wife's boyfriend?", "I don't really understand how that is related to the issue.

He's going to lose her.\n\nUnreliable narrator aside (OP doesn't seem interested in WHY his daughter hates his wife so much), it doesn't really matter. It doesn't matter who the asshole in this situation is. Is he going to get a judgment of N T A and send the thread to his daughter? Will that magically make her like his wife? No. She'll never forget that he couldn't show her that his relationship with her mattered. Mom's boyfriend will probably walk her down the aisle. He's going to lose his daughter, and for what? Because he can't tell his family that, while he loves them, he loves his daughter too? He lives full-time with his wife and kids and can't give a single day to his daughter?", "Which is her choice.

Maybe the new wife and his daughter do not get along, just like many adults don't get along for various reasons but she does get along with her mums BF, her father can't dictate who she gets along with. \n\n\nSo now he has to decide if he can separate his wife and his daughter. If not, then he has to cut her off completely and accept that he is no longer part of his family or life. \n\n\nI do not understand why  the onus has to always be put on the child of divorced parents to just accept the new partners or lose the parent, find middle ground,  it isn't exactly hard.", "Exactly, it is her choice, and she will know that if he doesn't show up, then he has put his new family first. It isn't disrespectful, would you invite a colleague or neighbour you didn't like to your wedding?  This is exactly the same.

They developed over time, as people living together in a society learned what worked and what didn't. \n\nYou can't not invite your parent's spouse to your wedding, even if you hate your parent's spouse. You don't have to dance with them, or get them a corsage/boutonni\u00e8re. You don't have to be happy they're there. You don't have to hang with them. You just invite and tolerate them, because it is cruel to expect your parent to choose between their spouse and you, in a situation where you're the only person putting them in the position to choose, in the first place. I mean, it's not like daughter and step-mom both need a kidney and dad is choosing step-mom.\n\nBy the same token, as the parent, your first reaction shouldn't be, \"Well then, I'm not coming either.\" Instead, you should be trying to work things out, and to get your (adult) child to see the position she is putting you in, and try to make her see the error of their ways.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xv5qo/comment/j7uf14j/?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3", "She does, but I would imagine he wants to maintain a relationship with her.", "But he has OTHER children, too.\n\nShe's an adult snubbing her half-sibling.", ">In conflicts between parents and children,  parents always have to be the bigger people\n\nShe is 27, not 13, and OP is being the bigger person.", "Being the bigger person does not mean being a doormat or allowing the other party snub your side with impunity.\n\nOPs responsibility is to take care of the woman whom he is married to and the children he is raising.

Explain that walking her down the aisle is not just for show but really means something, that  you both deserve a good relationship with each other, and that she shouldn't have to continue simmering in toxic resentment the rest of her life. \n\nThis is probably your last chance to rescue the relationship. You indicate you're feeling distant because she's pushed you away for so long, but surely that's simply a coping mechanism and down deep, you want to reconcile with your child? Her not inviting your wife wouldn't hurt so much if there were really a vast emotional distance.", "Exactly! The fact that I relate better to toxicity than healthy environments is terrifying.", "This is probably it. Her mom wouldn't even necessarily have had to manipulate her into taking her side. His daughter may have just used teenager logic to convince herself that her mom made a mistake & dad wouldn't forgive her, so he may do the same to her if she ever made a mistake.  \nAnd honestly, this may be her \"testing\" him by putting him in a situation where she knows he can't meet her expectations, so that she can justify staying mad at him to herself.  \nI say NTA, but it's borderline NAH because I think his daughter is only being an asshole out of irrational hurt that needs to be worked out in therapy."]}
