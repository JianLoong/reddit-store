But she also has to respect your decision to decline her invitation. You're well within your rights to not go because she hasn't invited your family but has invited her mothers.\n\nIt sounds like your daughter has a lot of issues surrounding your and your ex-wife's separation. She's making choices around those issues and those choices have consequences. She can't have her cake and eat it too.", "INFO: why is she ok with her mom\u2019s new partner but not yours?", "NTA.

If your daughter rescinds the invitation then that's her choice.", "NTA - based on the facts presented, the fact that she invited her mom\u2019s boyfriend and his kids, clearly indicates that she isn\u2019t attempting to avoid drama by only inviting her birth parents.  Rather, she has invited her mom\u2019s new family and specifically excluded yours.  Since you have attempted to explain this and she drew the line in the sand, your decision to support your wife and kids is the correct one.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou don't invite one half of a married couple to your wedding.

(And truly, if someone is engaged, living with a partner, or otherwise in a long-term relationship, you should invite those significant others, too.)\n\nSince your daughter is an adult, and about to be married herself, someone needs to tell her that. It just isn't done. If someone is important to you, but you don't like their spouse, you hold your nose, and invite the spouse, too.\n\nSome adult kids legitimately don't know this. When my kid got married last year, they didn't. They were trying to cut down the guest list, and didn't think they had to invite a relative's spouse, since they didn't know that spouse, until I set them straight.\n\nMaybe you can approach it like that with your daughter -- as a matter of etiquette?\n\nAs to your small children, is their age perhaps an issue? (How old are they?)\n\nLots of people don't invite children to weddings, or there will be an age minimum for guests. Now, often, people make exceptions for close family, but if your daughter is not close to her half-siblings, I can see where she might not be enthusiastic about inviting little ones.\n\nAre you helping financially, with the wedding?

Can you talk to her about any of this?", "NTA - If the wedding were child-free, I could understand not inviting your younger children, but that is clearly not the case.  If your ex didn't get the plus one of her current SO, again I would understand, but that is not the case.  Your daughter has essentially said \"Mom is allowed to have a new life and family, but you are not.\"  For all those who talk about the damage to the relationship if you don't go, they should think about the damage your grown ass daughter is doing all by herself.  You are not there to be her emotional punching bag and puppet.  Attending the wedding without your family simply says that you allow her to dictate your life and disrespect your current family.  She doesn't have the right to do that unless you give it to her.", "NTA - That \"freedom\" she mentions goes both ways...

You\u2019re absolutely within your right to decline to attend! It\u2019s an invitation, not a summons.

They lose the relationships they previously had with both parents and then have to take on a package deal relationship with strangers. \nWhy is it expected that kids who are already going through an emotional minefield that they are not equipped to deal with.

You need to have a few, frank, discussions with your daughter telling her what you told internet strangers what happened according to you. \n\nBy not telling her what is happening from YOUR perspective in an age appropriate way you have created this situation for yourself.

Age appropriate honesty is what you should have given to her back then.", "This is just an opinion based on what you've been able to post. Were I in your shoes, there would be a deep feeling of disrespect. Although we always love our children, we may not always like them as a person in a situation. This is that situation. By only inviting you and expecting you walk her down the aisle, she's shown disrespect to you, your wife and her siblings. She's made it abundantly clear that your role at her wedding is for pride and selfishness, expressing the reason she is bothered by your non-attendance is that she won't have her father walk her on her special day.  \n\n\nIt's not for love of you, or your relationship as others have reiterated already and you are under no obligation to do performance duty. She's created a situation where love and affection is transactional, she's willing to be your daughter only on her terms and without regard to your feelings as a person. If we were to reverse roles, and it was the parent who was doing this to their child, Reddit's advice would be to cut ties because this behavior is toxic.   \n\n\nAt 27 your daughter is more than capable of comprehending that her parent's marriage did not work out, and she is now using her wedding as a way to hurt your wife, cause strife in your marriage, and embarrass YOU.

Excluded from celebrations, meeting future grand children, birthday parties, etc etc. There will be other fights and tantrums to get you to conform to these rules of exclusion.   \n\n\nIF you DONT go, the relationship between your daughter and you will sustain damage, and it might never be repairable.  \n\n\nSince this is a lose-lose scenario, my advice is simply to ask, what do you feel is best for you, your wife, and your other two children? How do you want to spend the next 30 years?", "She probably does resent you for moving on, or at least moving on first. You are technically NTA for not accepting the invitation BUT actions have consequences.

At the end of the day though this is your family, and sometimes it is better to be the bigger person, even when you\u2019re right and she\u2019s wrong. Weddings (and funerals) carry an enormous emotional weight. If you skip it there me be no coming back. She doesn\u2019t like your new family. She doesn\u2019t consider them part of her family. She may come around as she grows and mature\u2019s, or not. She may never have the relationship with them that you would like. You should make your peace with that, because if you try to force it, that will ruin your relationship with her.

You understand she'd feel humiliated if you didn't, and that honestly, you'd feel terrible if you didn't, too.\n\nBut then tell her, by the same token, you feel humiliated that she is not inviting your wife. It's a thing that is just not done. It goes beyond rude. It is spiteful.\n\nAre your parents alive? Do you have siblings that have a decent aunt-uncle relationship with your daughter? Can anyone plead your case? Would your ex-wife be your ally, here? How about the ex-wife's boyfriend?", "I don't really understand how that is related to the issue.

He's going to lose her.\n\nUnreliable narrator aside (OP doesn't seem interested in WHY his daughter hates his wife so much), it doesn't really matter. It doesn't matter who the asshole in this situation is. Is he going to get a judgment of N T A and send the thread to his daughter? Will that magically make her like his wife? No. She'll never forget that he couldn't show her that his relationship with her mattered. Mom's boyfriend will probably walk her down the aisle. He's going to lose his daughter, and for what? Because he can't tell his family that, while he loves them, he loves his daughter too? He lives full-time with his wife and kids and can't give a single day to his daughter?", "Which is her choice.

Maybe the new wife and his daughter do not get along, just like many adults don't get along for various reasons but she does get along with her mums BF, her father can't dictate who she gets along with. \n\n\nSo now he has to decide if he can separate his wife and his daughter. If not, then he has to cut her off completely and accept that he is no longer part of his family or life. \n\n\nI do not understand why  the onus has to always be put on the child of divorced parents to just accept the new partners or lose the parent, find middle ground,  it isn't exactly hard.", "Exactly, it is her choice, and she will know that if he doesn't show up, then he has put his new family first. It isn't disrespectful, would you invite a colleague or neighbour you didn't like to your wedding?  This is exactly the same.

They developed over time, as people living together in a society learned what worked and what didn't. \n\nYou can't not invite your parent's spouse to your wedding, even if you hate your parent's spouse. You don't have to dance with them, or get them a corsage/boutonni\u00e8re. You don't have to be happy they're there. You don't have to hang with them. You just invite and tolerate them, because it is cruel to expect your parent to choose between their spouse and you, in a situation where you're the only person putting them in the position to choose, in the first place. I mean, it's not like daughter and step-mom both need a kidney and dad is choosing step-mom.\n\nBy the same token, as the parent, your first reaction shouldn't be, \"Well then, I'm not coming either.\" Instead, you should be trying to work things out, and to get your (adult) child to see the position she is putting you in, and try to make her see the error of their ways.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xv5qo/comment/j7uf14j/?utm\\_source=reddit&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3", "She does, but I would imagine he wants to maintain a relationship with her.", "But he has OTHER children, too.\n\nShe's an adult snubbing her half-sibling.", ">In conflicts between parents and children,  parents always have to be the bigger people\n\nShe is 27, not 13, and OP is being the bigger person.", "Being the bigger person does not mean being a doormat or allowing the other party snub your side with impunity.\n\nOPs responsibility is to take care of the woman whom he is married to and the children he is raising.

It has harmed you and your daughter\u2019s relationship to the point to where you may not walk your daughter down the aisle. \n\nNTA. IMO you need to talk to your daughter and lay it on the line about what exactly happened and why it upsets you that you\u2019re made out to be the bad guy here. I\u2019m assuming she doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with her step siblings, which would be more relationships hurt by this lie.", "She needs it laid out to her once and for all. \n\n1. Her mother caused the end of the marriage. It doesn't matter that she later on changed her mind, she wanted a divorce. She told you she didn't love you. She wanted to see other people. The marriage was over at that point.\n\n2. Your wife is not the reason you didn't reconcile with your ex. Your ex is that reason. If you had gone back, you would have been wondering if she was going to decide she was done again. You cannot live in a relationship where you can't even be sure if the other person loves you, not when she'd played happy families whilst wanting to leave for a long time already. \n\n3. Your wife and children are innocent. Your daughter and her mother are hating people who have done nothing to them. It's petty and childish. \n\n4. She is asking you to choose between your children. She is asking you to hurt your wife. She is asking you to choose her over your wife. She needs to understand that yes, she's your daughter, and yes, you love her. However, you will not hurt your wife and children in order to cater to her resentment. \n\n5. The only person she is hurting here is herself. She is damaging the relationship by letting spite and resentment lead her. Her mother tried to use her to force you to go back to her. When that failed, she used your daughter to punish you for being happy. Would your daughter do this to her own children? Even now, o bet part of her reasoning is that your ex says she can't be around your wife, even though your ex's boyfriend is going.", "So to be clear, she is the one pushing you out and not treating you as family though she wants to frame it as \u201cyou replacing her with a new family\u201d.\n\nShe just wants you there for appearances.", "You aren\u2019t the AH and I get your stance but ultimately I think you need to decide if this is worth permanently breaking your relationship with your daughter. It won\u2019t recover from this. Only you can answer that question", "OP, I would walk her down the aisle. It sounds like an image thing for her, but also that she really cares about it, and if you don\u2019t do it, it WILL be the end of your relationship with her. If you don\u2019t do that at least, you risk her never speaking to you again. You\u2019re NTA, but this is about the kind of relationship you want to have with her\u2014or if you want one at all. \n\nTell her you won\u2019t be there for the rest of the wedding because you won\u2019t tolerate your wife and other children being disrespected like that. But also tell her you couldn\u2019t miss the wedding entirely, because it\u2019s a once in a lifetime event for her and you love her enough to not let petty resentments get in the way of that. Maybe find a more diplomatic way of saying it, but make sure you\u2019re clear that to some degree this is a parallel between the way you two feel.", "From the eyes of your daughter she had her family torn apart, and then you replaced them, and now you won't attend without your new family. That must suck for her. I am not saying that is the reality but that sounds like how she is feeling so instead of making a happy day hard for her just put your ego aside and be there for her.", "no it wasn't hard, if it was hard, you wouldn't have said anything in the first place, you're not a prop, stop letting people get to your head like. You're her father. This is ridiculous. There are plenty of families that are like this.", "OP - tell her she won\u2019t be humiliated since her mum\u2019s new BF will be there to walk her down the aisle. If she were really fair, both parents and parties would be invited. It seems she is targeting you and not Mum. NTA", "OP\u2019s daughter is his family too. OP won\u2019t give any details as to why his daughter and wife don\u2019t like each other (other than \u201cI think it\u2019s because as a teen she wanted me and her mom back together\u201d) so it\u2019s hard to say whether her reasons for not inviting OP\u2019s wife are legit or not.\n\nPeople keep asking for more info on their relationship and OP isn\u2019t or won\u2019t give any insight which feels like there are important missing reasons. Although maybe we\u2019re just jaded from the constant horrible step-parent posts on here all the time.", "Kids are going to take sides. Their whole world has been blown up and they're looking for reasons and people to blame. Trying to explain what happened objectively is worth a shot but, you can't expect them to think rationally.", "Ah I get it now, you regret making assumptions!\n\nNo worries about that, at least I understand now.", "My daughter knows everything yes, I told her what happened when she got a bit older and could understand more but I think the resentment was already festered  unfortunately", "yes since a little before I met my wife.", "If she only wants him there for image that's the exact reason why he shouldn't be there! She doesn't care that what she says or does hurts him or his family.... She only cares that other people know she hurts him and his family. \n\nIf she wants the image she needs to actually take on the role. Otherwise Dad is just setting the precedent that she can stomp all over his and his family's feelings and treat them like garbage and they'll still be there to make her look good whenever she commands it.", ">People keep asking for more info on their relationship and OP isn\u2019t or won\u2019t give any insight which feels like there are important missing reasons\n\nRead his comments then, he says it perfectly but you wont so here the summ up \n\nMom wants a divorce because she doesn't love him anymore \n\nThey get divorced daughter is sad and angry at BOTH parents because they did not tell her that mom was the one who wanted a divorce \n\nMom changes her mind but dad doesn't want back in, she makes it clear to daughter that its dad that doesn't want the happy family back together, daughter is mad at dad \n\nDad finds a new wife thus putting the final nail in the coffin of the dream happy family, daughter is mad at wife \n\nDaughter has to get married, exludes wife and son of dad because she is still mad", "And have you asked her directly and in simple words why your wife and kids aren't allowed when your exes new husband is, especially since your ex wanted the break up? This is the answer you need, this is where you have to apply pressure till you know the reason why.", "Man, this really sucks. You'll obviously be hurting your daughter by not going, and you'd be disrespecting your wife and kids if you went without them...especially since ex's *boyfriend* and *his* kids are invited. Maybe your daughter needs some counseling to understand that she is one one now hurting herself and you.  The resentment she is holding is not healthy. Good luck OP!", "She may know everything, but you are way too forgiving of your ex-wife and I would bet your ex-wife was a bit more emotional describing why the split was actually your fault.\n\nYou really need to show some emotions with your daughter and tell her the divorce was your ex-wife's idea, that you were deeply hurt, that you couldn't trust her reconciliation attempt, and get a bit mad about her boyfriend being invited but not your wife.  If her new husband left her and then wanted to come back, would she trust him?  You've probably be vilified by your ex-wife.  It doesn't matter that she didn't cheat, it matters that she is the cause.", "Have you had a serious sit down talk with her about ***all*** of this? It sounds like issues have been festering for a long time and not isolated to the wedding invites. You seem \"aware\" of them but no signs of properly addressing them head on. It just feels like a bunch of avoidance for so long.\n\nI'm not sure *now* is the best time to do it though. This should have been addressed earlier and adding the stress of this to her wedding planning frankly would make it harder for you guys to resolve this issue without someone deciding to go no contact. Whether you go or not, I would try to set up a talk after the wedding or honeymoon. Maybe if *she* pushes for it, you can have it before, but warn her its a serious talk and a long time coming. That you *both* probably have a lot to say and you'll do your best to listen to her even if it hurts if she promises to do the same. It will be that kind of talk and in the end, you hope to be closer to her and not feel like you have to keep portions of your family separate. If possible, get a family therapist to help.\n\nWhatever you decide OP, I think its clear to you, that you have to do something here. Good luck.", "I\u2019d guess she just views it as you didn\u2019t take mom back when she tried so you\u2019re at fault. Even tho she initiated the divorce. I totally get and agree that you shouldn\u2019t take her back. It\u2019s too bad your daughter sees the situation this black and white.", "Some of her friends must have gone through similar stuff, maybe try that angle? Make her see you as people instead of parents by drawing parallells between you and her friends.", "Yeah maybe if you had told her sooner things would be better. Your ex wife wouldn\u2019t of been able to tell manipulate her. Your ex wanted back with you and seems pretty toxic, of course she would want your daughter to resent the situation.", "OP would not be hurting his daughter for not going. She is doing it to herself.  If she can't get over herself, no one can make help her."]}
