He didn\u2019t know how to cook, clean or do basically any other basic necessities. Mommy always did everything for him and held his hand through is entire life. Luckily he really stepped up and made an actual effort to learn adult things like getting a job, how to wash clothes, how to plan out meals, what to pack on trips etc. This is the only reason I really even agreed to date him since I can\u2019t stand people who are helpless and don\u2019t even try. After all, it wasn\u2019t his fault he wasnt taught these things or given any responsibility at home. \n\nUnfortunately, his brothers have been raised exactly the same. They can\u2019t do anything for themselves. I visited over on Thanksgiving and Christmas and it was so typical: men watched TV in the living room while the women organized literally everything. Except my boyfriend was helping because he\u2019s really starting to see how fucked up it is.\n\nSo last weekend we visited again. My bf, his brothers and dad went to visit some family while me, the mom and the youngest stayed home. She opened up to me about how she was feeling really tired dealing with two teenagers and a toddler at home since she isn\u2019t that young anymore. I tried to be symphatetic but also couldn\u2019t help but say that maybe she should get the boys to participate in chores more since she basically runs the house by herself. Husband works long hours, you know the deal. She said that she has tried after she saw how responsible my boyfriend has been, but it hasn\u2019t really worked out and she doesn\u2019t want to \u201dnag\u201d. I jokingly said, gesturing to the toddler, that maybe she should raise this one differently. She asked what I meant and I brought up how my bf didn\u2019t know basic life skills when he moved to college, and how it can be really beneficial to learn those kind of things from a young age and it could really take some stress off her since she wouldn\u2019t have to do absolutely everything. \n\nSo, she got kind of upset. Like who am I to judge her parenting skills when I don\u2019t even have kids etc., and I guess she has a point with that. Now I feel kind of bummed because we had quite a close relationship and maybe I overstepped a boundary.

I've never specifically sat my kids down and told them \"this is how you clean the kitchen.\" They watched while I did it and then when they did it, I'd tell them things they missed, etc. My older kids all know how to cook, not because I specifically taught them, but because at some point, they wanted food and I wasn't available to make it. \n\nSo yeah, I think it would have been smart to keep your opinion to yourself.", "NTA - it\u2019s idiotic when parents think no one can possibly give them advice on how to raise their kids.", "YTA. \n\nGenerally speaking, unless someone asks you for parenting advice or they are harming their kids, how someone raises their kids is their business (obvious caveat here about health(physical and mental) and safety.

Ever tried getting teenagers who are masters of passive resistance to do chores? It is a real fight in the beginning while you are training them. When you are already exhausted, it is actually less effort to do it yourself properly than stick to principles and fight to get them to do a half assed job. You don't know whether dad backs mum up to the boys or not. There is likely generational conditioning in both parents that women stay home and show their love by doing everything at home for the family. There is actually a fair bit of guilt to unravel and also, you have to let go a bit of things being done properly the way you like as well. Teenagers can be thoughtless and mums are not perfect.
