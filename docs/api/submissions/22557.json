I'm not sure how everyone's relationships work, nor should I pretend to, but this is AITA and you came seeking a stranger's advice, so I'll give it to you.\n\nWhen you talk to your partner like this, that means one of two things: A) you genuinely feel this way, or B) you don't, but you care so little for your partner's feelings that you feel justified saying it anyway.\n\nLet's take an example. Say you get angry with your partner for some reason, and you say you want a divorce. That either means you genuinely DO want a divorce, or you don't, but you are so angry that you're willing to weaponized a false claim to shock and hurt your partner. Neither approach is healthy.\n\nYou guys are seriously crapping on each other. From what you say, your partner does this a LOT. If she's doing this to vent, that's bogus. That's hurtful for the sake of hurting. That's not love bro. And you returned fire the same way - no matter if you were triggered to doing it or not, that's brutal. Weaponizing your partner's insecurities against them is textbook abuse. \n\nThe other aspect of this is that it curdles into established/acceptable behaviour. Instead of making changes to make yourself feel better, you chase the dopamine hits that putting your partner down gives you instead of making real, tangible improvements. So you're stuck in this vortex of suck.\n\nGet counselling, individual and couples. And start making REAL changes to address your REAL problems. Because this? This will just make you miserable and exacerbate your self loathing. Be better for yourself.", "Don\u2019t wait. Be proactive. Apologize to her and ask for one in return.

It doesnt bother me, what erks the shit out of me is shes always thinkin im gonna bail on her.

Dont do it, dont be so arrogant to think tomorrow is guaranteed and you can resolve things then.", "There's nothing inherently wrong with pizza. You just need to eat fewer slices to stay in a calorie range that leans towards losing weight. Instead of 4 slices, you eat 1 or 2. You don't have to eat plain chicken and broccoli for every meal in order to lose weight. Thinking you need to eat specific foods to lose weight is where so many diets end up failing. Depriving your body of food that it's been conditioned to crave makes consuming fewer calories very difficult. Eat less of what you like, but don't remove it completely. You still want to enjoy your life, not turn it into a drudgery of \"healthy\" foods. It's more about portion control and being aware of mindless grazing or sneaking snacks during the day than anything else. Get yourself into the mindset that you can eat what you like, you just can't eat as much of it. Once you make that a habit, it'll be easier to stay on a path towards maintaining a healthy weight for your body type.

Y'all are on the path to relationship failure.", "ESH, y'all need therapy badly...", "ESH. Her slightly more since she started it.", "I'm not going to give judgment because you both know what you both said was cruel. I will offer a little advice. First, you both need to start therapy, both individual and couples. Individually to work through whatever issues you have causing you to not be better to yourselves and each other, and couples to learn healthy ways to communicate. Because eating healthy and exercising to lose weight and be healthy can be very tough, and you both need tools to cope. I guarantee if you both start eating and exercising the same, you will lose weight fast and your wife won't lose as fast. It's just differing biologies. She needs to be able to not lose motivation and push thru when that happens. \n\nDiet and exercise, remember it's a marathon not a sprint. Don't diet, instead make healthy changes to your lifestyle. Start small. Drink soda? Eliminate it. Eat sweets? Veggies instead. Drink lots of water. Reduce pre-made foods and cook at home together instead. See if meal prepping on weekends for the entire week helps you avoid overeating and poor choices. Research because there are a lot of different methods, and finding what works for you takes time. Learn what a true serving size is,  and weigh and measure everything so you know it's the right amount. Plan cheat meals because denying yourself will lead to a bigger fall. Start walking. Figure out what activities you like doing. Join a gym when you're ready, use youtube videos to exercise at home. Be open to trying new things because you never know what you'll really like doing until you try it.", "The fact she would do this to someone she claims to care about is boggling.
