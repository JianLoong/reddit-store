I stay in contact with Rachel for my granddaughters sake. My granddaughter is 9 years old, and Rachel also has another daughter Amy, 3 years older than my granddaughter, who is not my sons child. She was from a past relationship Rachel had.\n\nNow the thing is, Amy grew up calling me Grandma for pretty much her whole life, I treated her exactly the same as I did my biological granddaughter, I would always take candy for both of them, give them both a little bit of pocket money, I hugged and loved (and still do love) Amy as much as I do my granddaughter. As far as I\u2019m aware, she\u2019s my second granddaughter.\n\nWhen my son and his wife divorced, I stayed in contact with his now ex wife to contact my granddaughter, and Amy has her own mobile phone. I also have her phone number and stay in contact with her occasionally. She still calls me Grandma as well. I didn\u2019t think this would be a problem, however last week when it was Amy\u2019s birthday, I gave Rachel some money to buy her a present from me. She was thankful, bought her a gift, wrapped it and sent me a picture of her opening it. \n\nLater that day, my son came round to visit me and my phone rang, it was Amy calling to say thank you for her birthday present. My son told me he found it inappropriate for me to be talking to his ex wife and her daughter, when she\u2019s not my granddaughter. He said I have absolutely no reason to be in contact with either of them as I see my biological granddaughter regularly, and that she\u2019s the only one who is family, so his ex wife and Amy who are no longer family have no reason for me to be in contact with them.\n\nI disagree as I only speak to Rachel about my granddaughter and I speak to Amy as for the last 10 years, I\u2019ve been treating her exactly the same as my biological granddaughter. I feel it would be unfair now to no longer have contact with her after so long.\n\nAITA for staying in contact with them both?

Amy is lucky to have you. \n\nBut your son is a major AH. Doing the math, he was with Rachel and therefore Amy for at least 9 years, since Amy was 2. He should consider Amy his 2nd daughter or at least should have built enough of a relationship with her to consider her feelings. \n\nKeep being a part of her life and don't worry about your son's opinion. He can't control your relationships.\n\nQuestion out of curiosity: how much contact do the 2 (half) sisters have? How does your younger granddaughter feel about your contact with Amy?", "NTA. I am in a similar situation now. My sibling and their spouse have separated after 30 years. During that time my in law has become like another sibling to me. Their separation was mutually agreed and, at the time, amicable. Fast forward 6 months and they can't stand each other, now my sibling expects me to end my friendship. I refuse to do that. \n\nWhen 2 people separate, they forget that it isn't just the 2 of them who are impacted. Other family members build their own, independent relationships with each other. They should not be expected to end them, just because the core relationship that brought them together has ended.", "NTA. You've been Amy's grandma got 10 years and she's your grandchild's half sister. You will always be connected to Amy and the ex wife. I'm glad you can be a constant presence in Amy's life. \n\nI'm guessing your son leaves Amy behind during his custody time, it's his right, but seems cruel to do to someone he raised for 10 years.", "NTA. And loving and generous to your second granddaughter.", "NTA. Your son doesn't get to police your relationships, and it doesn't sound like you staying connected to your granddaughter really affects him.", "NTA. Funny how kids want you to treat their step kids just like their own until they're done with mom or dad. You can't turn off love and family bc someone tells you to.", "NTA. My grandparents always kept in touch with my step-cousin Caitlin, even after the divorce. My grandparents live(d) for their grandchildren, and drew no distinctions between biological and not. More people loving and caring for a child is never a bad thing. \n\nYour son is being selfish and wrong here. He was Amy's stepfather for 10 years, walking away and not looking back is cold. I hope he comes around, but until he does, you do you. \n\nI bet Amy will remember how you cared for her for many years, in the way Caitlin did my grandma.", "NTA. My ex-MIL still calls me to talk on a regular basis. We still love each other and we consider each other family.", "NTA. It may be hard for your son to adjust, but adjust he must. You are Amy's grandmother in all but biology.", "NTA. Your son is a major one, though. Amy has been a significant part of your lives for *10 years* and your son is upset that you still talk to her and treat her with kindness, instead of dropping out of her life entirely as though she doesn't matter at all? He is demanding you do that to a literal *child?*\n\nNo wonder his wife divorced him. What a selfish, spiteful AH.", "NTA.\n\nHe got a divorce, not you.\n\nAnd grandkids are grandkids no matter if the parents are married or not.\n\nHe's just pissed that you're not making it easier for him to walk away.", "Did that kid also see your son as her dad?  You\u2019re doing everything right because this isn\u2019t about your son or his ex, it\u2019s about the child. Maybe your son can disconnect easily from that connection but he shouldn\u2019t dictate to others which relationships they are allowed to keep. You\u2019re don is the asshole and rather heartless.", "NTA\n\nNo way! Rarely do i see a relative keeping contact with the non biological relatives after a divorce. \n\nThe divorce was between your son and his wife, not between you and your granddaughters.\n\nAnd as far as I know, you don't talk about your son with your ex-DIL or with your granddaughters. \n\nGood for you for not forgetting her!", "NTA It's none of his business.", "Absolutely NTA! He doesn\u2019t her to dictate what kind of relationship to have, even with your granddaughters. His life is separate from yours. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re still available and present for them. Kudos and ignore your butt hurt son.", "NTA. Your son is controlling. Just because he is willing to drop people from his life, innocent ones moreover, doesn't mean everybody should do so. Keep loving those children.", "NTA. It is beautiful that you took Amy into your heart as your granddaughter. Abandoning her after a decade of loving her would scar her deeply. Your son is caught up in his anger about the divorce, but that is not a reason to demand that you hurt an innocent child.", "NTA.  Your son is being a AH.  His divorce doesn't determine your relationships, particularly when children are involved.  You formed your own bond with your granddaughter and Amy.  Family is the bond that you create and you created one with both children and rightfully are keeping that bond active.", "NTA, he divorced her, you didn't. \n\nHonestly it's nice for Amy that you've remained a loving figure in her life. It sounds like you connected with her more than your son (her step-father) ever did.", "NTA. Family doesn't just include our biological family, and as someone who grew up in a blended family, you're doing the only right thing here.  Your son is especially an AH for apparently not treating his step daughter as his own.", "Lol. Definitely NTA. Before my mom passed, she and my ex mother in law were best friends. They talked every night. I\u2019ve driven her to doctors appt and she was invited to all the holidays. Because I am an asshole, one Mother\u2019s Day, I took them both to lunch and posted a pic of us hanging out.", "NTA of course.\n\nThere are some cases where the parent seems to go out of their way to let their way to grief their biological child, which I find ridiculous.\n\nBut in this case, maintaining contact with with a persona and their children whom you had a 9+ year relationship is fully reasonable.  I wouldn't invite them to family Christmas and create hostility, but most other things are on the table. \n\nI know at least 2 sets of older adults who maintain a relationship with their divorced children's ex.", "NTA in the slightest. You've been a part of her life for at least the last 9 years. You're her grandma and a divorce shouldn't change that. Imagine how crushed she would have been if you just disregarded her existence after the divorce? She'd be so crushed and so confused! Keep kicking ass grandma! She's lucky to have you!", "NTA.  I still talk to my former in-laws, not just my MIL.  We were family for years and feelings just don't die because my ex and I got divorced.  My MIL still buys me a Christmas present every year and I am expected to stop by and pick it up.  My kids are teenagers now (my ex and I split while they were in elementary school) and they think it's a good thing that I get along with that side of the family.  My ex made a comment to his MIL about it once and she told him to get over it.    \n\n\nI love my former MIL.  She is very big on holidays, especially Christmas, so I have always made sure that the girls are with her and that side of the family on Christmas and Christmas Eve.  Yes, that means that I haven't spent those days with my kids since my ex and I split, and I'm ok with that.  I don't do that for my ex, I do that for her.", "NTA. You are an amazing grandmother to show your love for your granddaughter, and more amazing to teach Amy that a blood relationship doesn't make a family. \n\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t lose a grandma over her parents decision. This isn't being besties with an ex and gossiping about your son's life after Rachel, which would change my opinion. This is telling a child that they deserve love when their life gets messy after a divorce.", "NTA\n\n  Your son can't tell you what to do with your time and who to to keep in contact with. I would understand if you were buddy-buddy with his ex, but if you only talk about the girls with her, he has no leg to stand on. \n\n Info : isn't he in contact with his ex too to speak about their daughter? In the same way you are?", "NTA - as long as it\u2019s just keeping in contact with the grandchildren.\n\nHowever, if you are maintaining a really good friendship with your sons ex wife, this could be detrimental to you and your sons relationship, so be careful.", "Nope, you are being a wonderful grandparent. Your done probably wanted you to like Rachel and Amy when he first introduced them to you. And you did as he wished. Inform him that you are not flippant about who you love. And frankly, you think it\u2019s inappropriate how flippant he is with people he was supposed to love forever", "NTA and I'd be ashamed of your son abandoning a kid who he has been Dad to for 10 years. He has some nerve telling you off, the absolute vile thing that he is.", "NTA - you are an excellent Grandma.", "NTA. \n\nYour son divorced his wife, not the kids. Amy is your granddaughter just as much as your bio granddaughter", "NTA\n\nMy aunt initially maintained a similar relationship with her former step-grandson. He eventually has mostly rejected her but her intent was there. I mean she was in his life for his childhood so you don't just walk away from that.\n\nYour son is not in charge of you and he brought them into your life, he doesn't get to choose your relationship thereafter.", "NTA. Amy is only three years older than your biological granddaughter, which means Rachel divorced her first husband when Amy was a todler, and you've been her grandma as long as she can remember. For her and her half-sister there is no difference in the granddaughter-grandma relationship they have with you. It would have been weird and cruel to break contact with Amy and only keep in touch with her sister, only because of a difference in blood-relation that has never been relevant to the girls themself. You are doing the right thing, kudo's to you!", "NTA, its not your sons call to decide who you can have contact with and for what reason. Its also not on him to decide who you consider your grandkids. Your son needs to stay in his line here, he is very entitled thinking he can control you like this. \n\nAlso you are a great grandparent. Keep up with the good work.", "NTA.\n\nHe has been in the girl's life for 10 years and he's not staying in touch and doesn't seem to care or worry about her. That should be the issue here.\n\nBe careful he doesn't decide to not let your see your other grand-daughter just because he doesn't agree with you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your son then has to decide how he\u2019s going to take it.\n\nYou\u2019re son is going to find this weird. It\u2019s going to feel like you\u2019re taking the ex\u2019s side in someway. Doesn\u2019t he feel close to Rachel as a daughter?\n\nUnless there are aspects of the split you don\u2019t know about, like infidelity, then he\u2019ll probably come around.\n\nIn the moment of surprise he had a wtf reaction. Upon reflection I hope he can change his perspective.", "NTA\n\nThank you for being a wonderful human and loving grandma in both of your grandchildren\u2019s lives.\n\nIt\u2019s not your son\u2019s business at all, especially if it took him a year to realize it.  It\u2019s shocking that he would try and control his own mother instead of being respectful.\n\nI\u2019m disgusted that an adult could be so spiteful and selfish to a child.  What kind of person can just throw away a 10 year relationship with an innocent child who he knowingly became a father to?\n\nHow heartbreaking for Amy that the men in her young life have been such a disappointment and you raised one of them even though you seem to be the exact opposite. \n\n Keep being you and doing the absolute right thing for Amy and her sister.  I wish you all a peaceful and happy life!", "Depends on the reason for the divorce. If she cheated or was nasty to him I can understand why he would be upset that you are in contact with her. Either way you should have been honest with your son that even after the divorce you want to stay in touch with all of them and how you see your relationship in the future. Your loyalty should be to your son - not his ex. I think it\u2019s the fact that he wasn\u2019t aware of your relationship and felt blindsided.", "Once again, the wisdom of the father in the movie Clueless: you divorce wives, not children.\n\nGrandma gets it, dad does not.\n\nGrandma, carry on. Family is not necessarily defined by blood. If you and Amy believe you're Grandma and granddaughter, then you are...\n\nDon't let anyone say otherwise.", "Came here to say this. \n\nOP, You are the best grandma both girls could ask for. Keep it up! \n\nI had a grandma who wasn\u2019t my biological grandmother. And she also had a stepdaughter from a previous marriage and her daughter was my niece. Family isn\u2019t always who is related by blood but also who we choose as family.", "That was my first thought. He\u2019s known Amy since she was 2 at the oldest and now he just pretends that she doesn\u2019t exist? It\u2019s so cruel I\u2019m having a hard time understanding it.", "OP is a good person. So NTA.", "Also it\u2019s not at all unusual to have \u201cadopted\u201d grandparents - older neighbours, an older family friend, that one lady at church. There\u2019s always room for an extra grandparent and you aren\u2019t treading on any toes. It\u2019s lovely that they have been able to maintain the relationship and none of sons business anyway.", "You know, I have seen that movie literally dozens of times over the years and it didn't occur to me until just now what a meaningful and wholesome comment that was.", " \nIt's great that you are still available and present for them. Appreciation and ignoring hurt your ass boy.", "Thank you. So many posts like this the person gets destroyed.", "You wouldn\u2019t like it? You\u2019d still be the person that little girl grew up with as a step-father. You would have helped raise her and you\u2019d have an issue with her maintaining a relationship with her grandmother? I don\u2019t get that.", "This! It's not only about dropping 10 years worth of love and a relationship, but given that there wasn't anything malicious or traumatic, why make an innocent child loose so much stability needlessly, she's just a kid, I don't see anything wrong with what you're doing if anything it's very amicable", "You expect your parents to cut off a loved one because you no longer love them? Unless they cheated or abused you, that is incredibly selfish. I hope you can work on that.", "that was her DIL who she presumably loved. If she wants to maintain the relationship (other than cheating or abuse) it's absolutely selfish of the son to try and tell OP they have to cut off contact with a loved one. He needs therapy.", "I\u2019d rather not go into it too much, but no accusations of abuse, cheating or anything like that were mentioned by either my son or his now ex wife. I believe it was her choice rather than my sons and at first I had lots of questions but now I just simply stay out of it. They are both adults in their 30s and can deal with their own divorce. Sometimes adults divorce, and while I of course support my son, I cannot allow a 9 and 13 year old child to suffer from it.", "haha the more grandchildren the better", "Exactly, it\u2019s good he can\u2019t try to leverage OP seeing his daughter to try to get his way. And it\u2019s insane that he expects OP to just drop that relationship with Amy, as if 9 years of being her grandmother magically just disappear because Rachel and Henry are no longer married.", "Imagine how crushed she would have been if you just disregarded her existence after the divorce?", "You're doing a great job, Grandma!  I'm proud of you!", "Just looking to make sure Clueless was in the comments!", "That's because his behavior is disgusting. He may be an \"adult\" but you should probably sit him down and have a come to Jesus meeting with him about his behavior, how disappointed you are in him and how he was surely raised to be better. You're NTA, he's a huge AH and should be ashamed of himself.", "If Amy called OP \"Grandma\", I bet she called Henry \"Dad\"... Henry is a callous AH.", "How much do you want to bet this was \u00e0 reason for the divorce ?", "Didn't you read it?\n\nIt sounds like parents talk about her to her ex and if they just talked about the kids she would be fine with it. \ud83d\ude44", "He did abuse me. He committed various crimes against me. Police reports exist to back that up.\n\nBut thanks for the assumptions", "This comment should be framed and exposed in the Louvre. She can be friends with whoever she wants, it\u2019s not like if the ex wife was a monster to her son", "And also I find it sad that he just drops his step daughter he raised for her whole life practically like a dirty rag. I would be very disappointed in my child if he did that.", "Even if you maintained a relationship with Rachel otherwise you aren't the ah. She was family to you, your son doesn't suddenly get to decide she isn't. He's being selfish.", "Am I correct in assuming your son no longer treats Amy as his child at all? Did he act as her father during their marriage? Was her biological father in the picture at all?", "NTA, then, so long as you're information is accurate. \n\nFalling out of love is not a crime. As long as she didn't betray him, you're in the right. Kids over adults, forever and always.", "I see why they got divorced now", "Yeah, the fact he so easily and quickly dropped a child from his life- to the point he is mad his mom didn't do the same- a child he helped raise since toddlerhood, shows me *very* clearly that this man never treated or considered her as anything even close to a loved one.\n\nThe folks who are like that almost always favor thier bio-child greatly and openly once they have them.\n\nI'm glad the ex wife divorced him, but it's a shame it wasn't sooner. Nobody should stay with someone who could act like that towards a child- like they are a second-class child or just a tolerable-ish nuisance attached to the person they want to date. He didn't need to take over as father, but he can at minimum certainly act like a loving family member and role model and not favor his own child over his step child.\n\nHe sounds like a reeeeeal catch. I hope the next woman he dates doesn't have any previous-relationship kids, otherwise they will have a potential stepfather/mom's boyfriend that couldn't give them the time of day. Kids deserve better than to live with someone who just sees them as an inconvenience.", "Thank you for reading \ud83e\udd23\n\nYes, my objection is that my parents are facilitating proxy access to me that I no longer consent to be given. Because he can\u2019t harass me directly anymore, he now manipulates my family into passing on his unwanted contact and giving away my life updates that he shouldn\u2019t have. If they would just say \u201cHey, that\u2019s my daughter. I can\u2019t discuss her with you, but would love to hear how *you\u2019re* doing. How\u2019s your career? How\u2019s your family?\u201d we\u2019d have zero problems and we\u2019d still be close. Now I tell them nothing about me, because they won\u2019t protect my privacy.", "Reread my comment. I didn't make any assumptions. I clarified that unless they abused you or cheated on you. This is not the case and I'm sorry you went through that. I hope your parents come to their senses.", "She most likely does see her granddaughter through her son, but obviously can't see Amy through him as she was her son's step-daughter so the only way would be through his ex-wife.", "He can do whatever he wants. He doesn\u2019t get to dictate and control what OP does, though.", "It doesn't matter if he has no legal responsibility to her, he was a parent to her for 10 years and doesn't want anything to do with her now because he divorced her mom. He dropped a child who most likely saw him as her father or step father for her whole life only for him to abandon her because he divorced her mom", "Its not that the son can't keep a relationship with the step child, it's that he doesn't WANT to keep a relationship with her and doesn't want anyone in his family, like his mom, keeping a relationship with her either. \n\nDid we read the same post or are you just choosing to ignore what op said?", "OP\"s son is that you!?.", "I am sorry to hear that \ud83d\ude1e", "I know. That was exactly the argument i gave in my vote, that he can't dictate her relationships with someone else.", "Yeah I think parents keeping in touch with former son/daughter in-laws need to be thoughtful about not just their own intentions but also the intentions of the former in-law. Why do they want to stay in touch with you? What topics are they bringing up? Are they asking you for things they shouldn\u2019t? If they\u2019re just saying hi and sending you pics of the grandkids, that\u2019s awesome. If they\u2019re prying about or badmouthing your child, it\u2019s not innocent or neutral, or a gesture of family unity, to play along."]}
