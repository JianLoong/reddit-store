I stay in contact with Rachel for my granddaughters sake. My granddaughter is 9 years old, and Rachel also has another daughter Amy, 3 years older than my granddaughter, who is not my sons child. She was from a past relationship Rachel had.\n\nNow the thing is, Amy grew up calling me Grandma for pretty much her whole life, I treated her exactly the same as I did my biological granddaughter, I would always take candy for both of them, give them both a little bit of pocket money, I hugged and loved (and still do love) Amy as much as I do my granddaughter. As far as I\u2019m aware, she\u2019s my second granddaughter.\n\nWhen my son and his wife divorced, I stayed in contact with his now ex wife to contact my granddaughter, and Amy has her own mobile phone. I also have her phone number and stay in contact with her occasionally. She still calls me Grandma as well. I didn\u2019t think this would be a problem, however last week when it was Amy\u2019s birthday, I gave Rachel some money to buy her a present from me. She was thankful, bought her a gift, wrapped it and sent me a picture of her opening it. \n\nLater that day, my son came round to visit me and my phone rang, it was Amy calling to say thank you for her birthday present. My son told me he found it inappropriate for me to be talking to his ex wife and her daughter, when she\u2019s not my granddaughter. He said I have absolutely no reason to be in contact with either of them as I see my biological granddaughter regularly, and that she\u2019s the only one who is family, so his ex wife and Amy who are no longer family have no reason for me to be in contact with them.\n\nI disagree as I only speak to Rachel about my granddaughter and I speak to Amy as for the last 10 years, I\u2019ve been treating her exactly the same as my biological granddaughter. I feel it would be unfair now to no longer have contact with her after so long.\n\nAITA for staying in contact with them both?

Amy is lucky to have you. \n\nBut your son is a major AH. Doing the math, he was with Rachel and therefore Amy for at least 9 years, since Amy was 2. He should consider Amy his 2nd daughter or at least should have built enough of a relationship with her to consider her feelings. \n\nKeep being a part of her life and don't worry about your son's opinion. He can't control your relationships.\n\nQuestion out of curiosity: how much contact do the 2 (half) sisters have? How does your younger granddaughter feel about your contact with Amy?", "NTA. I am in a similar situation now. My sibling and their spouse have separated after 30 years. During that time my in law has become like another sibling to me. Their separation was mutually agreed and, at the time, amicable. Fast forward 6 months and they can't stand each other, now my sibling expects me to end my friendship. I refuse to do that. \n\nWhen 2 people separate, they forget that it isn't just the 2 of them who are impacted. Other family members build their own, independent relationships with each other. They should not be expected to end them, just because the core relationship that brought them together has ended.", "NTA. You've been Amy's grandma got 10 years and she's your grandchild's half sister. You will always be connected to Amy and the ex wife. I'm glad you can be a constant presence in Amy's life. \n\nI'm guessing your son leaves Amy behind during his custody time, it's his right, but seems cruel to do to someone he raised for 10 years.", "NTA. And loving and generous to your second granddaughter.", "NTA. Your son doesn't get to police your relationships, and it doesn't sound like you staying connected to your granddaughter really affects him.", "NTA. Funny how kids want you to treat their step kids just like their own until they're done with mom or dad. You can't turn off love and family bc someone tells you to.", "NTA. My grandparents always kept in touch with my step-cousin Caitlin, even after the divorce. My grandparents live(d) for their grandchildren, and drew no distinctions between biological and not. More people loving and caring for a child is never a bad thing. \n\nYour son is being selfish and wrong here. He was Amy's stepfather for 10 years, walking away and not looking back is cold. I hope he comes around, but until he does, you do you. \n\nI bet Amy will remember how you cared for her for many years, in the way Caitlin did my grandma.", "NTA. My ex-MIL still calls me to talk on a regular basis. We still love each other and we consider each other family.", "NTA. It may be hard for your son to adjust, but adjust he must. You are Amy's grandmother in all but biology.", "NTA. Your son is a major one, though. Amy has been a significant part of your lives for *10 years* and your son is upset that you still talk to her and treat her with kindness, instead of dropping out of her life entirely as though she doesn't matter at all? He is demanding you do that to a literal *child?*\n\nNo wonder his wife divorced him. What a selfish, spiteful AH.", "NTA.\n\nHe got a divorce, not you.\n\nAnd grandkids are grandkids no matter if the parents are married or not.\n\nHe's just pissed that you're not making it easier for him to walk away.", "Did that kid also see your son as her dad?  You\u2019re doing everything right because this isn\u2019t about your son or his ex, it\u2019s about the child. Maybe your son can disconnect easily from that connection but he shouldn\u2019t dictate to others which relationships they are allowed to keep. You\u2019re don is the asshole and rather heartless.", "NTA\n\nNo way! Rarely do i see a relative keeping contact with the non biological relatives after a divorce. \n\nThe divorce was between your son and his wife, not between you and your granddaughters.\n\nAnd as far as I know, you don't talk about your son with your ex-DIL or with your granddaughters. \n\nGood for you for not forgetting her!", "NTA It's none of his business.", "Absolutely NTA! He doesn\u2019t her to dictate what kind of relationship to have, even with your granddaughters. His life is separate from yours. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re still available and present for them. Kudos and ignore your butt hurt son.", "NTA. Your son is controlling. Just because he is willing to drop people from his life, innocent ones moreover, doesn't mean everybody should do so. Keep loving those children.", "NTA. It is beautiful that you took Amy into your heart as your granddaughter. Abandoning her after a decade of loving her would scar her deeply. Your son is caught up in his anger about the divorce, but that is not a reason to demand that you hurt an innocent child.", "NTA.  Your son is being a AH.  His divorce doesn't determine your relationships, particularly when children are involved.  You formed your own bond with your granddaughter and Amy.  Family is the bond that you create and you created one with both children and rightfully are keeping that bond active.", "NTA, he divorced her, you didn't. \n\nHonestly it's nice for Amy that you've remained a loving figure in her life. It sounds like you connected with her more than your son (her step-father) ever did.", "NTA. Family doesn't just include our biological family, and as someone who grew up in a blended family, you're doing the only right thing here.  Your son is especially an AH for apparently not treating his step daughter as his own.", "Lol. Definitely NTA. Before my mom passed, she and my ex mother in law were best friends. They talked every night. I\u2019ve driven her to doctors appt and she was invited to all the holidays. Because I am an asshole, one Mother\u2019s Day, I took them both to lunch and posted a pic of us hanging out.", "NTA of course.\n\nThere are some cases where the parent seems to go out of their way to let their way to grief their biological child, which I find ridiculous.\n\nBut in this case, maintaining contact with with a persona and their children whom you had a 9+ year relationship is fully reasonable.  I wouldn't invite them to family Christmas and create hostility, but most other things are on the table. \n\nI know at least 2 sets of older adults who maintain a relationship with their divorced children's ex.", "NTA in the slightest. You've been a part of her life for at least the last 9 years. You're her grandma and a divorce shouldn't change that. Imagine how crushed she would have been if you just disregarded her existence after the divorce? She'd be so crushed and so confused! Keep kicking ass grandma! She's lucky to have you!", "NTA.  I still talk to my former in-laws, not just my MIL.  We were family for years and feelings just don't die because my ex and I got divorced.  My MIL still buys me a Christmas present every year and I am expected to stop by and pick it up.  My kids are teenagers now (my ex and I split while they were in elementary school) and they think it's a good thing that I get along with that side of the family.  My ex made a comment to his MIL about it once and she told him to get over it.    \n\n\nI love my former MIL.  She is very big on holidays, especially Christmas, so I have always made sure that the girls are with her and that side of the family on Christmas and Christmas Eve.  Yes, that means that I haven't spent those days with my kids since my ex and I split, and I'm ok with that.  I don't do that for my ex, I do that for her.", "NTA. You are an amazing grandmother to show your love for your granddaughter, and more amazing to teach Amy that a blood relationship doesn't make a family. \n\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t lose a grandma over her parents decision. This isn't being besties with an ex and gossiping about your son's life after Rachel, which would change my opinion. This is telling a child that they deserve love when their life gets messy after a divorce.", "NTA\n\n  Your son can't tell you what to do with your time and who to to keep in contact with. I would understand if you were buddy-buddy with his ex, but if you only talk about the girls with her, he has no leg to stand on. \n\n Info : isn't he in contact with his ex too to speak about their daughter? In the same way you are?", "NTA - as long as it\u2019s just keeping in contact with the grandchildren.\n\nHowever, if you are maintaining a really good friendship with your sons ex wife, this could be detrimental to you and your sons relationship, so be careful.", "Nope, you are being a wonderful grandparent. Your done probably wanted you to like Rachel and Amy when he first introduced them to you. And you did as he wished. Inform him that you are not flippant about who you love. And frankly, you think it\u2019s inappropriate how flippant he is with people he was supposed to love forever", "NTA and I'd be ashamed of your son abandoning a kid who he has been Dad to for 10 years. He has some nerve telling you off, the absolute vile thing that he is.", "NTA - you are an excellent Grandma.", "NTA. \n\nYour son divorced his wife, not the kids. Amy is your granddaughter just as much as your bio granddaughter", "NTA\n\nMy aunt initially maintained a similar relationship with her former step-grandson. He eventually has mostly rejected her but her intent was there. I mean she was in his life for his childhood so you don't just walk away from that.\n\nYour son is not in charge of you and he brought them into your life, he doesn't get to choose your relationship thereafter.", "NTA. Amy is only three years older than your biological granddaughter, which means Rachel divorced her first husband when Amy was a todler, and you've been her grandma as long as she can remember. For her and her half-sister there is no difference in the granddaughter-grandma relationship they have with you. It would have been weird and cruel to break contact with Amy and only keep in touch with her sister, only because of a difference in blood-relation that has never been relevant to the girls themself. You are doing the right thing, kudo's to you!", "NTA, its not your sons call to decide who you can have contact with and for what reason. Its also not on him to decide who you consider your grandkids. Your son needs to stay in his line here, he is very entitled thinking he can control you like this. \n\nAlso you are a great grandparent. Keep up with the good work.", "NTA.\n\nHe has been in the girl's life for 10 years and he's not staying in touch and doesn't seem to care or worry about her. That should be the issue here.\n\nBe careful he doesn't decide to not let your see your other grand-daughter just because he doesn't agree with you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
