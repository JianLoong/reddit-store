I stay in contact with Rachel for my granddaughters sake. My granddaughter is 9 years old, and Rachel also has another daughter Amy, 3 years older than my granddaughter, who is not my sons child. She was from a past relationship Rachel had.\n\nNow the thing is, Amy grew up calling me Grandma for pretty much her whole life, I treated her exactly the same as I did my biological granddaughter, I would always take candy for both of them, give them both a little bit of pocket money, I hugged and loved (and still do love) Amy as much as I do my granddaughter. As far as I\u2019m aware, she\u2019s my second granddaughter.\n\nWhen my son and his wife divorced, I stayed in contact with his now ex wife to contact my granddaughter, and Amy has her own mobile phone. I also have her phone number and stay in contact with her occasionally. She still calls me Grandma as well. I didn\u2019t think this would be a problem, however last week when it was Amy\u2019s birthday, I gave Rachel some money to buy her a present from me. She was thankful, bought her a gift, wrapped it and sent me a picture of her opening it. \n\nLater that day, my son came round to visit me and my phone rang, it was Amy calling to say thank you for her birthday present. My son told me he found it inappropriate for me to be talking to his ex wife and her daughter, when she\u2019s not my granddaughter. He said I have absolutely no reason to be in contact with either of them as I see my biological granddaughter regularly, and that she\u2019s the only one who is family, so his ex wife and Amy who are no longer family have no reason for me to be in contact with them.\n\nI disagree as I only speak to Rachel about my granddaughter and I speak to Amy as for the last 10 years, I\u2019ve been treating her exactly the same as my biological granddaughter. I feel it would be unfair now to no longer have contact with her after so long.\n\nAITA for staying in contact with them both?

Amy is lucky to have you. \n\nBut your son is a major AH. Doing the math, he was with Rachel and therefore Amy for at least 9 years, since Amy was 2. He should consider Amy his 2nd daughter or at least should have built enough of a relationship with her to consider her feelings. \n\nKeep being a part of her life and don't worry about your son's opinion. He can't control your relationships.\n\nQuestion out of curiosity: how much contact do the 2 (half) sisters have? How does your younger granddaughter feel about your contact with Amy?", "NTA. I am in a similar situation now. My sibling and their spouse have separated after 30 years. During that time my in law has become like another sibling to me. Their separation was mutually agreed and, at the time, amicable. Fast forward 6 months and they can't stand each other, now my sibling expects me to end my friendship. I refuse to do that. \n\nWhen 2 people separate, they forget that it isn't just the 2 of them who are impacted. Other family members build their own, independent relationships with each other. They should not be expected to end them, just because the core relationship that brought them together has ended.", "NTA. You've been Amy's grandma got 10 years and she's your grandchild's half sister. You will always be connected to Amy and the ex wife. I'm glad you can be a constant presence in Amy's life. \n\nI'm guessing your son leaves Amy behind during his custody time, it's his right, but seems cruel to do to someone he raised for 10 years.", "NTA. And loving and generous to your second granddaughter.", "NTA. Your son doesn't get to police your relationships, and it doesn't sound like you staying connected to your granddaughter really affects him.", "NTA. Funny how kids want you to treat their step kids just like their own until they're done with mom or dad. You can't turn off love and family bc someone tells you to.", "NTA. My grandparents always kept in touch with my step-cousin Caitlin, even after the divorce. My grandparents live(d) for their grandchildren, and drew no distinctions between biological and not. More people loving and caring for a child is never a bad thing. \n\nYour son is being selfish and wrong here. He was Amy's stepfather for 10 years, walking away and not looking back is cold. I hope he comes around, but until he does, you do you. \n\nI bet Amy will remember how you cared for her for many years, in the way Caitlin did my grandma.", "NTA. My ex-MIL still calls me to talk on a regular basis. We still love each other and we consider each other family.", "NTA. It may be hard for your son to adjust, but adjust he must. You are Amy's grandmother in all but biology.", "NTA. Your son is a major one, though. Amy has been a significant part of your lives for *10 years* and your son is upset that you still talk to her and treat her with kindness, instead of dropping out of her life entirely as though she doesn't matter at all? He is demanding you do that to a literal *child?*\n\nNo wonder his wife divorced him. What a selfish, spiteful AH.", "NTA.\n\nHe got a divorce, not you.\n\nAnd grandkids are grandkids no matter if the parents are married or not.\n\nHe's just pissed that you're not making it easier for him to walk away.", "Did that kid also see your son as her dad?  You\u2019re doing everything right because this isn\u2019t about your son or his ex, it\u2019s about the child. Maybe your son can disconnect easily from that connection but he shouldn\u2019t dictate to others which relationships they are allowed to keep. You\u2019re don is the asshole and rather heartless.", "NTA\n\nNo way! Rarely do i see a relative keeping contact with the non biological relatives after a divorce. \n\nThe divorce was between your son and his wife, not between you and your granddaughters.\n\nAnd as far as I know, you don't talk about your son with your ex-DIL or with your granddaughters. \n\nGood for you for not forgetting her!", "NTA It's none of his business.", "Absolutely NTA! He doesn\u2019t get to dictate what kind of relationship to have, even with your granddaughters. His life is separate from yours. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re still available and present for them. Kudos and ignore your butt hurt son.", "NTA. Your son is controlling. Just because he is willing to drop people from his life, innocent ones moreover, doesn't mean everybody should do so. Keep loving those children.", "NTA. It is beautiful that you took Amy into your heart as your granddaughter. Abandoning her after a decade of loving her would scar her deeply. Your son is caught up in his anger about the divorce, but that is not a reason to demand that you hurt an innocent child.", "NTA.  Your son is being a AH.  His divorce doesn't determine your relationships, particularly when children are involved.  You formed your own bond with your granddaughter and Amy.  Family is the bond that you create and you created one with both children and rightfully are keeping that bond active.", "NTA, he divorced her, you didn't. \n\nHonestly it's nice for Amy that you've remained a loving figure in her life. It sounds like you connected with her more than your son (her step-father) ever did.", "NTA. Family doesn't just include our biological family, and as someone who grew up in a blended family, you're doing the only right thing here.  Your son is especially an AH for apparently not treating his step daughter as his own.", "Lol. Definitely NTA. Before my mom passed, she and my ex mother in law were best friends. They talked every night. I\u2019ve driven her to doctors appt and she was invited to all the holidays. Because I am an asshole, one Mother\u2019s Day, I took them both to lunch and posted a pic of us hanging out.", "NTA of course.\n\nThere are some cases where the parent seems to go out of their way to let their way to grief their biological child, which I find ridiculous.\n\nBut in this case, maintaining contact with with a persona and their children whom you had a 9+ year relationship is fully reasonable.  I wouldn't invite them to family Christmas and create hostility, but most other things are on the table. \n\nI know at least 2 sets of older adults who maintain a relationship with their divorced children's ex.", "NTA in the slightest. You've been a part of her life for at least the last 9 years. You're her grandma and a divorce shouldn't change that. Imagine how crushed she would have been if you just disregarded her existence after the divorce? She'd be so crushed and so confused! Keep kicking ass grandma! She's lucky to have you!", "NTA.  I still talk to my former in-laws, not just my MIL.  We were family for years and feelings just don't die because my ex and I got divorced.  My MIL still buys me a Christmas present every year and I am expected to stop by and pick it up.  My kids are teenagers now (my ex and I split while they were in elementary school) and they think it's a good thing that I get along with that side of the family.  My ex made a comment to his MIL about it once and she told him to get over it.    \n\n\nI love my former MIL.  She is very big on holidays, especially Christmas, so I have always made sure that the girls are with her and that side of the family on Christmas and Christmas Eve.  Yes, that means that I haven't spent those days with my kids since my ex and I split, and I'm ok with that.  I don't do that for my ex, I do that for her.", "NTA. You are an amazing grandmother to show your love for your granddaughter, and more amazing to teach Amy that a blood relationship doesn't make a family. \n\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t lose a grandma over her parents decision. This isn't being besties with an ex and gossiping about your son's life after Rachel, which would change my opinion. This is telling a child that they deserve love when their life gets messy after a divorce.", "NTA\n\n  Your son can't tell you what to do with your time and who to to keep in contact with. I would understand if you were buddy-buddy with his ex, but if you only talk about the girls with her, he has no leg to stand on. \n\n Info : isn't he in contact with his ex too to speak about their daughter? In the same way you are?", "NTA - as long as it\u2019s just keeping in contact with the grandchildren.\n\nHowever, if you are maintaining a really good friendship with your sons ex wife, this could be detrimental to you and your sons relationship, so be careful.", "Nope, you are being a wonderful grandparent. Your done probably wanted you to like Rachel and Amy when he first introduced them to you. And you did as he wished. Inform him that you are not flippant about who you love. And frankly, you think it\u2019s inappropriate how flippant he is with people he was supposed to love forever", "NTA and I'd be ashamed of your son abandoning a kid who he has been Dad to for 10 years. He has some nerve telling you off, the absolute vile thing that he is.", "NTA - you are an excellent Grandma.", "NTA. \n\nYour son divorced his wife, not the kids. Amy is your granddaughter just as much as your bio granddaughter", "NTA\n\nMy aunt initially maintained a similar relationship with her former step-grandson. He eventually has mostly rejected her but her intent was there. I mean she was in his life for his childhood so you don't just walk away from that.\n\nYour son is not in charge of you and he brought them into your life, he doesn't get to choose your relationship thereafter.", "NTA. Amy is only three years older than your biological granddaughter, which means Rachel divorced her first husband when Amy was a todler, and you've been her grandma as long as she can remember. For her and her half-sister there is no difference in the granddaughter-grandma relationship they have with you. It would have been weird and cruel to break contact with Amy and only keep in touch with her sister, only because of a difference in blood-relation that has never been relevant to the girls themself. You are doing the right thing, kudo's to you!", "NTA, its not your sons call to decide who you can have contact with and for what reason. Its also not on him to decide who you consider your grandkids. Your son needs to stay in his line here, he is very entitled thinking he can control you like this. \n\nAlso you are a great grandparent. Keep up with the good work.", "NTA.\n\nHe has been in the girl's life for 10 years and he's not staying in touch and doesn't seem to care or worry about her. That should be the issue here.\n\nBe careful he doesn't decide to not let your see your other grand-daughter just because he doesn't agree with you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She did things for me that no one would have and had more patience than a Saint. For example, coming from abuse I had PTSD and had triggers that would send me reeling. One of them was not having anyone knock or come into my room at night. My brother and niece would sometimes forget, and so she gave me a lock to put in my room and an intercom system so she can check in on me. She sometimes slept on my floor too on the hard nights.

I feel awful for this little girl who is apparently losing the man she likely considered a father figure as long as she remembered, while her sister gets to keep him.", "My grandmother got the old Gerber Grow-Up insurance plan for me and all my cousins. When my younger half-sibling was born, no blood relation to my grandparents, she was absolutely livid to find out that she wasn't allowed to get them the same plan (I guess they have or had a policy that only parents or grandparents could do it), because as far as she was concerned we were all her grandchildren and what child was ever hurt by having too many loving grandparents?", "One of my uncles (my mother\u2019s brother) got divorced from his wife after years of marriage. My grandmother has maintained the relationship with his ex-wife all these years, even now that their children are all grown up. His ex would come over for dinner at my grandmother\u2019s house often, and nobody really thought anything of it. You\u2019re right. Feelings don\u2019t just die because of the divorce.", "That line meant so much more to me after my mom and step dad split and he never stopped treating me like his daughter. It\u2019s so important to the kid to have that person still be there, and I can\u2019t imagine being a step parent to someone for so long and not ever wanting to still be in their life.", "I think you missed the crux of the issue in this story - where he thinks he has the right to ask granny to cut off the child too just because he divorced her mother.\n\nThat is AH behavior.", "I don't know what your relationship was with Rachel prior to this, but this kind of breaks my heart. And makes me desperately grateful my dad's family never stopped considering my mum family, even now decades post-divorce with my father dead. Of course, my father never pushed them to do so, and that would have made it difficult, certainly. But it still makes me so deeply sad. I am so glad you are keeping Amy in your life, though. \n\nA romantic relationship ending doesn't have to mean this sort of total cut-off, especially with co-parenting to come. I hope your husband learns this at some point.", "Thank you!", "I wholeheartedly agree with this. My mom divorced my father when I was 5... but her and my paternal grandmother had a very friendly relationship and nothing would have ever changed that. And now my father has been in a relationship with his SO for 25 yrs... they never have a get together at their house without inviting my mother. My mom and my dad's SO are very much alike and get along fabulously. :)  No reason divorce from a spouse means you divorce the rest of the family!", "Definitely not disagreeing! But, I always see the whole \"so many criminals are raised by single mothers\" thing (I think the general was actually specific, but I can't recall exactly). That's just one of the examples where, instead of blaming a shitty or absentee father, they go for the mother.", "Don\u2019t forget Rachel! She deserves credit, too. She has allowed and fostered the relationship. \n\nI can totally imagine an ex refusing to let the grandma see the stepchild and this sub totally backing her up. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe your ex\u2019s mom anything blah blah blah [insert petty revenge].\u201d\n\nRachel rose above that attitude and allowed her daughter to maintain some stability after the divorce that she might not have otherwise had.", "I absolutely cannot understand why your son can give up his relationship with Amy so easily, or expect you to do the same. NTA in any way. I wish more grandmas were like you.", "When my cousin got with his third wife, this happened with him, too.", "Kinda wanna say OP should go LC or NC with her son because he is awful, miserable man and I would've loved to be a fly on the wall for the court hearing as to all the reasons they divorced.", "We know now why they divorced. But OP is the sweetest person, I would love to had a lovely grandma like her", "Had not considered that point. Ignoring the issues that caused the divorce, Rachel is working to maintain the relationship to be if it her daughters. We don't have the details of the divorce to know the causes, but in one way Rachel is thinking of her daughter's good, I'm keeping the OP close. A loving grandparent is something all kids need, especially after a breakup", "When my niece was four or five I met up with her and her parents at a park, to give her a Christmas present. I was forewarned that niece had two friends with her so I stuck a pack of stickers in my bag in case the other kids were upset. They were, and when I gave them the stickers they lit up.", "Definitely NTA you get to decide who you see as family, their divorce doesn\u2019t change that if you don\u2019t want it to. And even if it did you can be friends with who ever you want to and that includes your ex daughter in law and her daughter.", "This. When my mom and step dad split, my step dad never changed how he treated me. I introduce him as my dad and he introduces me as his oldest daughter (I was about 5 when my mom and him started dating, his bio daughter was 3). Even now, 12 years after the split, nothing has changed. He helped raise me for over a decade. I can\u2019t imagine how that poor girl feels when the man who helped raise her cut contact with her. That poor girl. \n\nOP, NTA. Your son is, though, heavily.", "NTA, and your son has NO say at all in this. It is your relationship to a person you want to have in your life. Not his life, not his relationship, not his decision any more. OP, it is really heartwarming to read your post. You were able to accept this child as your granddaughter and you stick to it despite the fact your son cut ties to her mother. This is great, and I wish you all the best!", "I dated my ex for less than a year and I was heartbroken to not see his son any more I can't even imagine losing a child that's been with me for 10 years"]}
