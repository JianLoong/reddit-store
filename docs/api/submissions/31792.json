Our mom was quite abusive to all three of us, but P and I managed to recover from that and mom has also reformed about 90%. \n\nHowever A who has lived in another country for the last 20 years with her husband and kids has not recovered from the childhood trauma. \nI am guessing that thats why she keeps incurring debt, refuses to get a job and explodes at the slightest disagreement. \n\nA often reminds my brother and I how our mom was most abusive to her and not as much to us. (Which I don\u2019t agree with). I think mum controlled and emotionally abused all three of us but eventually stopped. And my brother and I got years of therapy but A refused to get any therapy. \n\nThe three of us visited our parents last week. And A exploded again when my dad asked her about her debts and any plans of a job. She owes my parents $8000, my brother $5000 and me just $1500. And other loans of about $20000.\n\nWe have never asked her back for the money. But we have always been concerned with her spending habits and refusal to take serious action about her life. \n\nI usually keep out of it and don\u2019t mind her not returning my money. Because I earn well. And because A would have never asked me for $1500 back, she is a very generous person.\n\nBut I did mention that she needs to take some serious audit of her life and not make this her husbands burden alone. She started yelling at me and hitting herself. I got really scared of her like I used to as a child. Probably because I am 7 months pregnant and very sensitive. \n\nEventually we all cooled down and I my husband (29m) came to pick me up. I broke down crying in the car and he insisted I tell him why I was so upset. \n\nI told him everything and he called my sister and told her how dare she yell at someone who is 7months pregnant and wishes nothing but well for her. \nShe apologised to him. And called me to apologise but also told me that I was an asshole for violating her privacy and sharing her financial struggles with my husband. But mostly apologised for yelling.\n\nSo am I the asshole for telling my husband about my sister\u2019s  situation and violating her trust and financial privacy?\n\nEdit: I kindly ask the readers to not ask me any more details of our childhood abuse. It\u2019s extremely upsetting to go into those details. I shouldn\u2019t go there in my current condition. I think I have gotten my answer for the question that I had asked.

We were all controlled and manipulated and abused. But my brother or I don\u2019t say that yours wasn\u2019t as much as mine. It\u2019s just an icky thing to say.
