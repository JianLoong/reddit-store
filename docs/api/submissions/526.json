My gf(17f) is the opposite, because she was never able to go out a lot. I\u2019ve always told her that i don\u2019t like homecomings or proms because i never saw the hype and im sensitive with lights. When homecoming was showing up around the corner, i\u2019ve always told her that i didn\u2019t want to go but she insisted i went and even bought my ticket so i wouldn\u2019t have a choice. I told her that i\u2019ll go but it\u2019s not because i want to, but because she bought my ticket and i felt bad that she wasted her money. I bought a suit, flowers, and even gave her friends a ride everywhere we went and to their houses. Once we got to the school, i wasn\u2019t happy. We met up with her friends and she seemed really happy so i kinda just firmed it. The actual homecoming was so boring and i didn\u2019t know what to do. Lights were flashing everywhere and when she noticed i was in pain she started taking me away from the light and talked too me. I was telling her that i\u2019m not happy and that i\u2019ll just stay in a corner while she dances with her friends. She felt bad that not only was i uncomfortable and in pain, but also that she made me go. After an hour we stepped outside and just hung out in the parking lot while we waited for her friends. She had mixed emotions about everything. She felt bad that she made me go knowing i wouldn\u2019t like it, but she also thought that i should\u2019ve just pretended that i was happy so she wouldn\u2019t feel bad. \n\nThat was 2 months ago but it got bought up again recently and i\u2019m starting to feel bad.

She makes it a big deal because it\u2019s her senior year and wants to do all this stuff because it\u2019s now or never. if i could\u2019ve just formed it for like 2 hours she would\u2019ve been happy.

It'll take some figuring out. You don't want to stop her being able to go out and have fun, but you also don't want to be put in a position where you're uncomfortable. Compromise is key - maybe if you had planned it a bit more in advance (i.e you drive everyone there, stay for an hour then come back for last dance and pick up or something - giving your social battery a chance to recharge). Being with someone like that does mean you will have to go to things you aren't comfortable with sometimes, and they'll have to put up with going to events alone that they'd rather have you with them. It's no-one's fault, it's just how people are.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t a healthy relationship. She doesn\u2019t care about your feelings, if she did she wouldn\u2019t have bought you a ticket so you\u2019d feel obligated to go. She definitely didn\u2019t respect you\u2019re boundaries in this situation.", "NTA \nAs another commenter said, she didn\u2019t respect your boundaries but on the other hand, I can kind of see her side as well. She wanted to attend a school dance and she wanted to share that with you. A lot of girls in high school want to do Homecoming and Proms. \nIf this is just a one instance of her disrespecting your boundaries, next time it is brought up or she asks you to go to another event just sit her down and have a rational and mature conversation. \nIt does seem that after everything was said and done, she did have remorse, she even sat in the parking lot with you instead of rejoining her friends. If she was an AH, I don\u2019t think she would have acted like that.", "NTA\n\nYou told her you didn't want to go and that the lights would bother you and she still pressured you into going. \n\nThen one you are there and visibly in pain she wants to act like she cares about your feelings for a bit. Then she also trys to blame you for ruining the mood when you were in physical pain.\n\nShe is most definitely TA. I mean what did she really expect to happen? That your photosensitivity would magically be cured by the power of homecoming spirit?", "NTA\n\nYour gf seems a bit self-centered. She saw that the lights caused you pain, yet she still thought you should have pretended you were happy so she wouldn't feel bad.\n\nI would reconsider this relationship. If you haven't done so already, please talk to your doctor about your reaction to the flashing lights. There might be something that would help you if you're in a similar situation in the future.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As do most people. There\u2019s a time and place for sitting at home. Make happy memories with your girlfriend at events. Being an unhappy guy in the corner is kinda toxic as well. If it was a weekly dance then I would tell you to just find something else to do while she goes but homecoming is a special event that she can\u2019t do when she gets older. Something you just gotta tough it out for the people you care about.", "NOITA  (No one is the Asshole)  Because you are both pretty young I read this as a learning experience, both of you learning about each other and what you are willing to do FOR each other.  You made it there, drove the friends, and even sat by while your GF danced.  You acknowledge that you were there for her but at some point, that generous well dries up.  If you decide to stick together bring this experience to your next social event, both of you can now be informed as to what the other expects and what is reasonable for each of you to accept in these situations.   I think if you both can see that an enormous amount of caring for each other was expressed during this maybe you can grow from this.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"but she also thought that i should\u2019ve just pretended that i was happy so she wouldn\u2019t feel bad.\"..
