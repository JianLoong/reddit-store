By the time of the trip, Rosie will be 2 and Cara will be 10.\n\nElla started arguing with me and was basically like how dare you come to us asking for permission to show favoritism to the girls, and that I'm being unfair to Rosie. She accused me of treating Cara better because I feel sorry for her for not having a mom and started going off about how Rosie deserves nice things too.\n\nI told Ella she's blowing things out of proportion and that age was the only reason. Ella said I have no self-awareness and that even if that was true, I'm still being unfair. She said if Rosie can't go then Cara shouldn't either.\n\nThe next day Ryan contacted me and told me I need to say sorry to Ella.

It's common sense surrounding age-appropriateness.", "NTA.\n\nI can\u2019t believe that the parents are ruining this girl\u2018s vacation when it\u2018s *clearly* because her sister is ONLY A YEAR OLD. \n\nOf course a 9-year-old is treated differently! This wouldn\u2019t be safe for a baby, and Rosie won\u2018t care or remember it anyways.", "NTA\n\nObviously you wouldn't take a 2yo on vacation.", "NTA\n\nYou should not be expected to take a two-year old to a theme park without her parents. That\u2019s just an unrealistic demand. \n\nElla clearly has unresolved issues regarding her stepdaughter and she unloaded them on you, which is not fair, especially when you were making such a generous offer for Cara.", "NTA.\n\nRosie is 1. This is a theme park. They just want a day off and see you as a way of getting it.\n\nI'd be firm with No.. just cara. No infants.", "NTA, taking a 2yo thats not yours to a theme park is insane.", "NTA.   What they are after is really a child free vacation when you take both kids off their hands.", "NTA- I get the feeling Cara is going to miss out on a lot of opportunities because of Ella.", "NTA.  There is a big difference between bringing a 2 year old and 10 year old.  It is as simple as that.\n\nElla may have some other stuff going on with Cara not being her biological daughter and is self conscious about this.  See if you can do something smaller with her to try and smooth things over.", "NTA.  I wouldn't be taking such a young child away with me either. The parents are being ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nBabies do not belong at a theme park. It's completely ridiculous to treat a 10 year old and a 2 year old exactly the same", "NTA.  And I will be real honest and say your brother and his wife have very questionable parenting skills.  No offense, but if my childless and young sister came to me and said she and an equally young and childless friend want to take my 10 year old to an amusement park along with a couple of older kids, I would consider it only if both my sister and my 10 year old are terribly mature and responsible for their ages.  So in the correct circumstances and with lots of rules in place, I would agree.  But there is no way I would turn them loose with my 2 year old toddler in a busy amusement park full of colorful and dangerous things m toddler would gravitate towards.  I might take them, but I wouldn\u2019t trust anyone else to watch my toddler in that situation.", "NTA and I recommend a serious talk with your brother because with is a red flag for your niece's relationship with her step mom and (down the line) sister. I'd worry she will constantly demand her own child is prioritised at the expense of her step daughter", "NTA  \nThis is ridiculous!   \nIf you haven't told Cara yet, keep that to yourself so she doesn't have her feelings hurt. If however Cara knows and they won't let her go because of this ridiculous request, make sure she knows it has nothing to do with her or you, and that she knows who said no.   \nThey don't deserve to have an easy go of it.", "WTF? NTA at all. I think Ella was more mad she wasn't going to get a week free from parental responsibility. Either way she's lost the plot. Rosie's not going to remember you not taking her. She's a BABY for crying out loud.", "NTA.  My partner has three nieces and a nephew - 8, almost 5, 4, and just turned three respectively.  We recently invited the girls over for a sleepover.  I was very clear that I didn't want to exclude the boy, but our house is not even close to toddler proof.  His mom was like \"oh god no, he would destroy your place.  He never gets to be the only kid - he'll be fine.\"\n\nBoth of our requests seem perfectly reasonable.", "Absolutely NTA. They are being completely unreasonable. Rosie is essentially a baby, and it would be very difficult to take her to a theme park. Depending on which one you visit, she may not be able to ride hardly any of the rides, plus I assume she\u2019s in diapers, takes naps, etc. and like you said, she wouldn\u2019t even remember the trip.\n\nIt\u2019s upsetting that they as parents can\u2019t recognize the huge difference between taking a 9yo kid on this trip versus a baby. They are being unreasonable and ridiculous. Please continue to try and maintain a good relationship with Cara, as I have a feeling that Rosie is clearly the favorite child in their home. Poor kid.", "NTA\nWho expects a relative to take a toddler to a theme park? If it were an afternoon at  the local zoo, your Sil would have a point, but taking the toddler to the theme park would guarantee misery for everybody involved.", "NTA. You going to take a toddler on roller coasters with y'all? Lol", "NTA. \n\nI grew up with a bunch of cousins ranging in age. My grandparents took my sister (just 2 years older than me) to stuff and not me, and then me and my sister on stuff the younger cousins didn't get to go on. Then, as we got older, they took the younger kids to stuff that we had outgrown. \n\nTaking a 9 year old to a theme park is awesome. Taking a one year old is a waste of everyone's time. This child will not remember this trip and cannot enjoy a single part of it, but will ruin everyone else's time because she will have to be watched, taken home for naps, and means someone has to stay with her whole others go on rides. \n\nElla is being remarkably unreasonable. I would talk to your brother first and be very clear- this was about doing something that is appropriate for a 9 year old and IS NOT appropriate for one year old. That's it. If he doesn't understand that himself, then don't even bother talking to Ella. If he does grasp the very basic critical thinking skills needed to determine there is a difference between where a 9 year old can go and a 1 year old can go, then you two can approach Ella. You can of course give the \"Sorry that wasn't my intention\" apology about her thinking you were treating the girls differently because they have different mothers. But be very clear, you want to be involved with both girls and do all sorts of things with them, together but also separately. That there's no way you would take a toddler on a trip like this, but when Rosie is 10, Cara will be 19 so you will be doing things with Cara that Rosie won't want to do. \n\nAlso Ella is clearly deeply insecure about Cara, which is gonna cause way more problems going forward.", "NTA - I recommend you send your brother this thread. He is potentially ruining a vacation and bonding time with you over something nonsensical. I would switch it around. If you took the one year old to a toddler gym class would the 10 year old want to go? No. There is an 8 year age gap and there will be plenty the older child will be able to do before the littlest one can. \n\nIt comes off as mom trying to get a free break (which could be requested in other ways) or feeling she has no place in the family and her newborn isn\u2019t as loved/respected. Either way, a child shouldn\u2019t have to miss out on activity due to adult emotions.", "NTA If anyone needs apologized to, it's Cara. Whether Rosie can go should not affect if Cara can, she is a separate person and should be allowed to go on a trip without her sister.\n\nAnd an 8 year age difference makes all the difference. They make no sense.", "NTA There is nothing for a toddler to do at a theme park. You wouldn't be able to do anything with the older child because you wouldn't be able to use any of the age appropriate attractions together with the older child. You would need to be with the younger child at all times.\n\nPossibly Sis is guilt tripping for a whole family deal? Believe me, she knows it's impossible to handle a baby, and the little one is still a baby, alone with another child at an amusement park.", "NTA \n\nRosie is a baby, she won\u2019t remember or enjoy the park all that much. You could take her to a puddle and get the same enjoyment. No reason you should need to take her, sounds like a lot of work for minimal reward.", "NTA I wouldn't let anyone take my two year old to a theme park even if they were invited. Utter madness, your SIL clearly has some insecurities about her place in the family and you're bearing the brunt of it", "NTA. There's no point in taking a 2 yo to a theme park resort; at best she won't really remember. At worst, the experience of visiting such a busy place without her parents (but with a bunch of strangers, your friend and her nieces) would stress her out in ways that might actually stay with her.\n\nHonestly, I feel it sounds like Ryan and Ella may be so desperate for a week without the little one they don't give a damn whether trying to guilt you into taking her along is actually a good idea.", "NTA. My brother brought my niece and nephew (both teenagers) to Universal last year. My other niece was 2 at the time and topic of her going was never broached, because all parties understood she would be too young to remember or care. Your brother's girlfriend has some serious issues.", "NTA \n\nWtf Rosie is 1. Even by the time of the trip she will still be too young to get on literally any of the rides. Ella is being purposely obtuse", "NTA. Who the hell wants to take care of a 2 year old at Disney? They won\u2019t even remember it. Sounds like the parents are trying to score a child free weekend or day or however long you\u2019re going for. \n\nTaking a 10 year old is WAY different than taking a toddler.

Not seeing how this is such a big deal for the mother.", "NTA, she just wants rid of her kid for a bit. Speaking as a mum of an almost 3 year old - it is wild trying to take care of a 2 year old in somewhere like a theme park for a day!

It\u2019s just the parents trying to pawn her off on you so they can have some \u201ctime\u201d together.", "NTA. Ella is insane. You do not treat 10 and 2 year olds the same, they are not. Taking a 2 year old to a theme park would be a ton of work and no one, not even the child would end up having much fun, and Cara shouldn\u2019t be restricted from going because the baby can\u2019t. It\u2019s not fair to effectively punish Cara because of her sister. That\u2019s a really good way to breed resentment and poison her relationship with her little sister, especially if Ella really intends to act this way all of the time and ban Cara from having fun of it isn\u2019t toddler friendly.", "NTA \n\nWho demands their baby go to an amusement park?", "NTA. You can\u2019t take a toddler on most rides, which means the 10 year old can\u2019t ride them either.", "NTA at all. You are totally right and they're being unreasonable. Cara is old enough to be easy to handle and care for herself, you have no obligation to take care of a demanding 2 year old, that will require all of your time during the trip. They are going to punish Cara by not allowing her to go have fun because her toddler sister can't come (now), she will end up resenting her sister because she can't do things without her and have a life of her own.", "NTA, the trip is for the older kids. What do they expect you to do with a one year old at a theme park!?! There's an 8 year age gap ffs. And even if the age difference wasn't so big and the younger one was under height requirements for the majority of rides you wouldn't be wrong to not include her. \n\nTell your brother and sister that you plan on actually being able to ride the rides and won't be able to be a caretaker for a young child at the same time. If they can't appreciate the offer to do something fun with the oldest then don't cave to a ridiculous ultimatum.", "NTA. I didn\u2019t take my OWN kids to theme parks when they were 2.

She is paranoid and is looking for reasons or excuses to say her little girl is being treated differently.  Also I am betting she was hoping you'd take both girls so she and hubby could have a time with no kids. \n\nYOU DID NOTHING WRONG!!! It was lovely that you were willing to take your niece on vacation with you. They should have been incredibly thankful and appreciative, instead of having NO COMMON sense and expecting you to take a child that is TOO YOUNG to go and will really have no memory of the trip - so a waste of time and expense for you. Not to mention that she will be unable to go on any rides the other children going will want to and be able to go on.  Taking a toddler would also be a lot more work and time consuming for you.  It makes NO sense to demand you take your youngest niece! \n\nNo, sorry THEY owe YOU an apology - ask your brother if he thinks you've been unfair in the past between the girls and ask for any examples.  Some are bound to be stupid ones that are differences due to the age gap between the girls.  You will not always be able to treat them 100% the same due to the age difference.

Maybe you should explain and laid out all possible scenarios that might happen to her. Like it will ruin the fun for YOU, your friend, and the other children, that Rose will and mostly likely cry and be uncomfortable the whole time, and if they keep insisting say that because your friend's neices and your 10 year old niece will like to ride and mostly likely you too sooo who will hold the baby? will it be okay with them for you to just leave her on her stroller or to a stranger? which is very very peone to kidnapping? ofcourse you can hold the baby but then what will be the point of YOU going to the amusement park? to babysit? Just laid it all out to ella and your brother\n\nOP is NTA\n\nEDIT: the baby will also cry when away from their mom.

But to my point I invited my niece to come over and spend the night when I get a new bioactive setup for my leopard Gecko because she's very into planting and isopods so it would be perfect to bond and she gets very little \"her\" time at either parents house because she has younger siblings at both and is often an after thought.

Being the youngest I was probably sad that I couldn't join when I was 3 or 4, depending on when we could go but once I was allowed to tag along, I remember having so much fun. I still remember those trips 20 years later. \n\nMaking Rosie wait a couple of years isn't going to harm her in any way shape or form. Her mother is just being overly sensitive about the whole thing. Nothing is stopping your brother and her from doing something fun with Rosie when you take Cara for the trip. It might actually be nice for Cara to get away and be with new kids her age for a change. I assure you bringing a toddler to a theme park is just going to slow the party down and cause tension since she can't join the older kids on all the rides etc.", "NTA. Your brother sucks for not standing up for Cara. If that's a normal family dynamic, Cara can only do what Rosie can do, he can look forward to low or no contact when she's an adult.

As a mom of 3, I will tell you there is nothing for a 2 year old to do, they won't remember it, and you will spend the day doing diaper changes and dealing with meltdowns. It will be miserable, as opposed to taking a 10yo told a theme park, which is awesome.   \nI would approach this from the standpoint of that the 1-2 yo won't remember anything, and you will be more than happy to have the same experience with them once they are the same age. My ex inlaws used to take all of the grandkids to Disneyland once they turned 8. That was the rule because they had to be old/tall enough for the rides. It is perfectly reasonable.

Because of the trouble he might get into.Lol", "Info: how you asked your brother if he is aware that by placating his wife, he is being a bad father to Cara? I'm so concerned that his wife doesn't consider herself a parent to Cara after all these years ( not even a mother but just a parent).

For one (no offense to you) what kind of parent trusts ANYONE with their kid for that amount of time when they are that young? Two, anyone with a 1yo knows that asking someone else to take the child for that long would be profoundly unreasonable. Its far too much work and responsibility to ask of anyone.", "NTA!

Isn\u2019t it?", ">Ella started arguing with me and was basically like how dare you come to us asking for permission to show favoritism to the girls, and that I'm being unfair to Rosie.\n\n\nSo when Cara is old enough to drive are they going to insist that Rosie be allowed to as well?  How about Rosie dating when Cara starts?  When Cara goes off to college are they going to say that Rosie should get to go also so that everyone is being treated equally and it's fair to Rosie?

No way.\n\nRidiculous.", "Nah, she wants a free babysitter. How dare she not take both kids so she can have time off!
