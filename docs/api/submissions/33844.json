He got into an awful car accident a couple months ago and though was not seriously injured he was shaken. He now often talks about how life is fleeting and we should make sure to be prepared.\n\nNate has 2 siblings, an older brother and a sister Tina (33). Tina is actually Nate\u2019s biological daughter. He had her in high school and his parents adopted her from birth. Her mom was never in the picture. The family all knows about this including Tina herself. Tina and my family were cordial but not close. \n\nNate\u2019s parents passed within a year of each other almost a decade ago. They split all they had 3 ways for their 3 \u201ckids.\u201d\n\nFive years ago Nate\u2019s older brother decided to join a monastery. He left behind all of his worldly possessions to Tina and my sons though my sons mostly got things of sentimental value while Tina got things of more monetary value.\n\nI think my in laws were all within their rights to handle their money as they saw fit. My problem is Nate.\n\nYesterday Nate told me he had a rough idea of how he would like his possessions taken care of. Basically he would like to split all he has 3 ways: Tina and our 2 sons. We don\u2019t have a lot but Nate has his parents\u2019 inheritance and he would like to give that to all his children equally.\n\nI asked him how was this fair? Tina was adopted by his parents and already received her inheritance as their daughter. If his parents gave him and his brother half and half, I would understand why he felt the need to provide Tina with something. \n\nAs it is, Tina already took from his share of the inheritance. Moreover his brother also gave her money and valuables worth more than our sons received. Tina is also a dentist. She is in no way in need of financial help.\n\nNate said at the end of the day Tina is his biological daughter and it is only right that he left her something. I don\u2019t think we need to pile more money onto a capable woman with a good job who already has so much while our sons are still young and just starting their careers.

Tina is an orphan as you and your husband don\u2019t really - by your own admission- treat her as a daughter. \n\nMake sure you raise your sons to be capable and self sufficient.", "NAH\nYou can make the point, but you need to accept his desire to leave money to all of his biological children.\n\nWhat if one of your kids got a high paying job? Would you cut them out of your will because they've got plenty of money ready?", "NTA. You made very valid points on what you would want for your biological children. People are going to say YTA, let them. You husband Nate is doing what he believes is right, even though his daughter is actually a granddaughter, but, that can be dismissed because she was adopted by his parents, so that makes everything different.\n\nAnyone who disagrees with you has a problem with fairness. It is okay to want the most for your children. You feel as if his daughter/sister has been given too many titles and has reaped the benefit of them. Fair. But, you also have to go back to it is his money. Fair.  You can now approach how you are going to deal with him and your children. Everyone always love when someone is \"making amends\". It all sounds so great, but, how about the others who will now get less due to the grand gesture someone else did to make amends for their mistakes.\n\nI would start diverting things so there will be less to split. Put this away, put that away. Happens all of the time. When people want to get into heaven, or whatever, they don't care about the others that would be negatively impacted. That is when those \"others\" caretaker steps in and champions for them.\n\nDon't listen to those who are trying to vilify your point. I wonder how many would change their minds if it were happening to them?", "It amazes me how many think they are more entitled to an inheritance compared to others in the family. The inheritance is Nate's to do with as he pleases, to share it with whomever he pleases. No one is entitled to any of it, no matter the split. Doesn't matter if you are his wife or his child.. adopted or otherwise.\n\nI can't imagine counting the money that is someone else's before they are even dead and buried, and being upset that the shares aren't fair. \n\nYTA, OP. You could die before him and then it really would not matter how he split HIS assets.", "YTA in my opinion. What he is giving her is a final statement that he values her the same as his other children. While it may not be \"fair\" in a purely financial sense, I seriously doubt this is about money to him and more about guilt. Doing this probably feels like the best he can do.", "YTA. This is some wicked stepmother shit", "Tina was starting her life at 23 and still got an inheritance. Your husband was stable and still got an inheritance. Your argument doesn\u2019t hold salt.\n\nYTA", "Depending on how are the legal terms but assuming 50/50... YOUR 50%, YOU do whatever YOU want... HIS 50%... you get the idea.", "YTA \n\nShe is his daughter. Stop playing evil step-mother who only wants her own children to be taken into comsideration. His daughter was raised by others while your sons have been raised by him and still have the person who raised them. You should be thankful for that not try to make sure she gets less. And she hasn't \"taken\" from your husbands share. She got the share that she deserves as their daughter. Also her career plays nonrole no role here. So if one of your sons decides to not work by that logic all money should only go to him?", "YTA  It is NOT your inheritance it is HIS from HIS family.  You have NO SAY in who he wants to give it to.", "YTA. \n\nShe\u2019s Nate\u2019s daughter also, so yes things should be split 3 ways!!!!!!!!!", "Nta.\nHonestly I get where you're coming from because she has already gotten her share of her parents money and then she got her other brother's share and then now she's going to get part of her other brother's share. I feel like your husband's heart is in the right place but technically that's not his daughter that's a sister. And for everybody else in the comments saying well that's his daughter so he wants to do right by her not his daughter that's his sister. He should be worrying about his two sons that he is raising he's taking care of that if something happens to him he should want to make sure they are okay. As she stated his sister's going to be okay.", "Her father didn't raise her. The both the people who did step-up and raise her are dead. She gets to watch her real dad raising 2 kids while having no parents.\n\nPlease, go on some more about how much much better she has it than your sons. \n\nI understand your positon, but honestly, when your are comming up w/ \"my sons are young and she has X, Y, Z\" comparing B.S. you completely lose me and you just sound jealous and entitled.\n\nNo one knows what the future will bring. Your sons may become millionaires and not need for anything, they may develop a gambling habit and blow everyting betting on NFL games. You don't know who \"needs\" what in 5 yrs or even 10 yrs, so quit with the comparisons of whoos more needful or has it rougher b/c you really just look petty.", "NAH\n\nUltimately it is your husband's choice, but discussing all options is fair. It does seem slightly unfair the way that he has decided to split the assets, and it will likely cause resentment between Tina and the other children/grandchildren.\n\nINFO: What portion of his assets would go to you?", "YTA.  The inheritance from his parents isn\u2019t a marital asset in a lot of places, and it\u2019s up to him to decide how to split it, whether you think it\u2019s fair or not.  The fact his think she\u2019s double dipping and doesn\u2019t need it isn\u2019t relevant.  Maybe if you had more than a cordial relationship with his daughter, things might be different.  You seem to hold a lot of resentment toward her.  Your husband probably feels a level of guilt for not having been a father to her.", ">Tina is also a dentist. She is in no way in need of financial help. [...] I don\u2019t think we need to pile more money onto a capable woman with a good job who already has so much while our sons are still young and just starting their careers.\n\nSo, lets say, hypothetically, Nate doesn't get hit by a bus and die tomorrow, and it's 20 years from now. Tina has had some extreme medical issues, forcing her to retire early and burn through her savings, so is just scraping by and in a precarious position, whereas your boys are in good jobs with a solid financial position. You'd be fine with Nate amending his will to leave it all to Tina, since the boys don't need it and she desperately does, right? If it's only based on who would need the money more, that's the only right call. Or, hell, say you had another kid in the next few years into, should that kid get it all because he's only staring out and your twin sons are in their 40s, established, and had parental support up to that point so don't deserve an inheritance? What if Tina died and left everything to your sons since she had no children herself and your hypothetical third kid missed out, should he get everything from Nate and the twins miss out because they already got a share of the wider family inheritance pool? \n\nIf you'd have a problem with any of that, then this argument is disingenuous: you don't care whether or not she *needs* the inheritance, or who deserves/can utilise it the most, you just don't like the idea of Tina being considered as Nate's child. Which is not an invalid opinion, but be honest about it rather than throwing in all these \"and anyway\" non-issues. \n\nYTA. Be honest about how you feel towards Tina and how Nate thinks of her/his position in her life (and how that has maybe contributed to her being \"cordial but not close\", regardless of Nate's feelings on it). You need to let him have the freedom to untangle what is already a messy relationship in whatever way is best for Nate and Tina, or let him 'pay off' the guilt for not doing that the way he has decided is what he needs. It's fine to advocate for your kids being taken care of and considered, but don't throw all these inane arguments into the mix and pretend that's the same thing.", "Usually if the spouse is still alive they get everything of monetary value for survival. It might be ok to leave a specific sum to the children each. By the way you worded it he isn\u2019t giving you a share at all. This is actually pretty strange that he would split up the assets in this way. If this is the case you could divorce him now and get half! (*not sure if this is true outside the US) Not saying you should or would want to do that! But you\u2019ve been married a long time and part of that is actually yours that you\u2019ve accumulated together.\n\nNTA", "YTA She is still his daughter biologically not legally. \n\nHe must care a great deal about her.", "I understand mathematically, why you feel that it\u2019s unfair, but holy crap you sound miserable. It isn\u2019t your money to care about. I am a little confused though, because generally, if your husband passed before you, you would still retain control of the finances.  The passing down of money happens when you\u2019re both gone. So if you die first, who cares? You\u2019re dead. Your sons should never expect to be handed money. If your husband does first, all your assets go to you until you pass. If he has a trust set up to handle the inheritance funds, then I can see how it would bypass you, but I\u2019m presuming you\u2019d still be taken care of. You make this about fairness to your sons but I think it\u2019s really just greed on your part. YTA", "NAH. I understand why you feel the way you do, but none of these things are for you to decide. You can split your own inheritance in whatever fashion you wish, but Nate's is his decision and he doesn't want to die and leave nothing to his *daughter*. He probably already feels a bit like he failed her by not being her parent and sees this as a way to make some amends. \n\nThe fact that she is well off financially and your sons aren't, although it makes your position understandable, ultimately isn't relevant. You can't dictate someone else's inheritance. \n\nI can see where everyone is coming from here, and nobody seems ill-intentioned, so no assholes. You are in the wrong, but it's understandable.\n\nThat being said I get the vibe from your post that you may be considering going to Tina directly and making your case to her. **Do not do that.** That is the move that will make you the asshole in this situation. Do NOT say a word to Tina about any of this; you can discuss your feelings on her place in the family and what she should expect in an inheritance in private with your husband but the minute you directly approach Tina and start trying to apply pressure you will be a gigantic asshole and Nate will explode. Justifiably.", "YTA. Fair or not, it is his choice who he leaves what to. Whether you like it or not he has 3 biological children. You're being greedy on behalf of your sons and its tacky AF.", "Yta", "NAH\n\nThe only solution I can understand is him leaving a 1/6th. If you both have half basically of your stuff, then your half would go to your children and he can split his section 3 ways. \n\nHim prioritizing her over the life he built is crazy imo. Especially as it's just a token to her at this point. Him getting closer to her, taking her to hang out more, etc. That would be totally normal, making up for lost time and all. I've seen the comments saying that she shouldn't count the other inheritance but that does matter imo. The woman is well taken care of and inheritance is a big early life boost.\n\nI get where you're coming from, but I can see a lot of guilt on his end. He might have never been okay with the situation totally but let it go because it worked. Or any range of feelings you can have from watching a piece of you run around. It seems more of an attempt to right his wrongs. It's tricky. Hope the best for you both", "Seeing the first responses, and I am guessing I am going to be in the minority. I am one who looks for equity in things, it is an issue I happen to gave. To be honest, I see your point, but at the same time, I can see your husband's thought process as well. To me, math needs to be involved and a study of the $'s associated.\n\nTo start, how significant was the inheritance from your in-laws, and how do these numbers compare to what you and your husband may be leaving behind?\n\nI also agree with a commenter pointing out that upon your husband's death, should he pass before you, those monies should be going to you as spouse. I assume the discussion more relates to when both of your are gone.\n\nMy suggestion to you and your husband is to find a middle ground. Figure out how something can be left to Tina while keeping her previous inheritance in mind. I would not be leaving your and your husband's estate divided simply three ways between your sone's and his sister/daughter. Without knowing the types of numbers, I can't tell your exactly how I would divide things up.\n\nAll in all. Look for a compromise. I think there is one that can be found.", "YTA\n\nNate personally should have given his inheritance back to his parents to be split between Tina and his brother for child support.\n\nAnd as a dentist Tina could be carrying a lot of debts. This could be why Nate\u2019s brother gave her more money than your sons. He could also saw her as the orphaned niece after her grandparents passed in comparison to your sons who had you and your husband and thought Tina needed greater support.\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s your husband\u2019s choice, OP. I\u2019m sure as the wife you will have your share of what you two built together but Nate is free to handle his money as he wishes.", "INFO: Is he talking about family money or joint money? What other provision is there for your sons if he dies while they are still young? (ie, life insurance policies, etc).\n\nWhile your sons are still young, he should be focused on providing what it will take to raise them and send them to college in his absence. After they graduate college, he can amend his will to include her more \n\nIn the meantime, he can't make up for not raising her with money, especially not at the expense of his other children.\n\nNAH, but you both need to be more pragmatic.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nYour husband\u2019s money, his choice.\n\nIn addition, your sons are fortunate in that they have/will have you and your husband to guide them through life and provide all kinds of support for the foreseeable future.

It is his money at the end of the day and his decision on how he wants to leave it. Tina may have received a share of the parents inheritance because she was an adopted daughter. My question here is: So what???\n\nNate is deciding how to leave his estate and unless you can prove he is not mentally capable of making that decision, you have no say in this matter.", "YTA", "I\u2019m confused why you\u2019re bothered. I got inheritance from my grandparents and will from my parents as well, just like Tina. Also, this isn\u2019t government money with rules; if people want to give her their own money, they\u2019re absolutey welcome to and you have no say. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s leaving out your other kids. This feels like something else and you may need to dig deeper to figure out why you\u2019re so bothered.", "This is some spanish novella type story here", "I'm voting NTA. \n\nIt sounds like a large portion of what your husband would be leaving is whatever remains from his inheritance -- which Tina also got for herself, and then again from her other brother/uncle. She is well established with a lucrative career, and doesn't appear to need an extra helping hand. \n\nMaybe a compromise could be that your husband divides his money between the twins and then leaves Tina something with sentimental meaning or a valuable family heirloom.", "YTA.\n\nIf she has inherited money from others and how much is none of your business. You can't be eyeing what others had given her and writing it down in a ledger to determine how much money your husband should inherit her in the future.\n\nThat money that was given to her previously is of no business to you. Do not be jealous over money that isn't yours.\n\nAlso, from the standpoint of a father, Nate is doing the right thing by dividing his money equally between his 3 children. He isn't going to snub his daughter by giving her less.\n\nAlso, Tina has no bio mom to run to. Her adoptive parents are dead. She only has her dad. Stop being the evil stepmother.", "NAH", "NTA. Tina got more than her fair share. The husband can leave her something sentimental.", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s your husband\u2019s prerogative to do as he wishes with inheritance, just as it was his parents\u2019 prerogative to do what they wanted with their money. Have you considered what Tina would feel if she was left nothing? Have you considered how difficult the entire situation might have been for Tina when she was growing up? Have you thought how considerate it is for your husband to acknowledge some sense of responsibility to all of his children, even the one that was, in a sense, taken off his hands long ago? \n\nIt is not about the money, it is about acknowledging her (even though you think she doesn\u2019t need it because she\u2019s a dentist and \u201calready took her share\u201d of his parents\u2019 money). I think this is a kind and thoughtful gesture, and you should honor your husband\u2019s wishes. \n\nMoney is fleeting, and you sound like a moneygrubber. It is disheartening to see how greedy people can get when loved ones start to get sick or die. Imo, NO ONE (adult) is entitled to another person\u2019s money on death, just as getting a gift of money from someone who died shouldn\u2019t be looked too much as \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cunfair\u201d - it should be considered a bonus and a gesture of acknowledgment.", "YTA. You seem to have a problem with Tina, and from the way you\u2019re talking about her, it seems to stem from her not being biologically yours.", "I think you should consult with an estate attorney, and if you decide to go this route, make sure the sons know ahead of time. Do they even know Aunt Tina is really their sister?", "Yta let's look at your reasons.  \n\n1-'She'll be established, and the boys will be younger.'  So, did your husband give her his inheritance since *he* was established and she was younger? \n\n2- 'It's not fair.' You know what else isn't fair?  Having your bio parents ditch you, then having your adoptive parents die when you're in your early 20s!  Thats not fair when people like your husband her their parents alive until they're in their 40s. \n\nYou sound like all you can think is 'Tina's so lucky!'  Pretty sure Tina would have rather waited another 20 years to get her inheritance and had her parents around for longer.  That lucky Tina with the dead parents!  Who wouldn't want to be her?\n\nNow that you know, feel free to take out and pay for a life insurance policy that will be split between your boys. Or a savinga account that will go to them.", "YTA. At the end of the day, Tina is also his daughter, and it is his will to treat her as such in his will. You, as his wife, can express your displeasure, but nothing else. You can do with your assets what you want within the law. He can do the same. The fact she is older than your sons and in another point of her life is of no consequence. Your husband was in another point of his life when your in laws died. Would you have agreed for him to be left nothing? I am sure you would have said something regarding your young kids or something like that. Don't push the issue.

Dad married a woman who never complained about the setup  as it was very beneficial to her & her nuclear family.

Idk why people are saying YTA when you\u2019re so clearly not. From what you said, it sounds like what your husband is leaving his sons is largely what was left to him from his parents.

What his parents left his daugther that they adopted has NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING. Nobody is keeping score (except YOU, apparently). What they left was their choice. What your BIL left was his choice. And what your husband leaves of his parents' inheritance is his choice. Not yours. And no, there is no universe where it's okay for your husband to disinherit his oldest child just because he was too young to parent her originally and because his parents left her something already. It's not about the money even - it's about showing that he loves them all equally and cares for them all equally. That he acknowledges her as his daughter. I personally think he's right.\n\nYou have no position here to argue from so if you continue to push the issue it will only backfire on you.

Your boys are getting 1/3 each of their father's stuff and presumably 1/2 each, or 100% total, of your stuff.

Tina is actually Nate\u2019s biological daughter. He had her in high school and his parents adopted her from birth. Her mom was never in the picture. The family all knows about this including Tina herself. Tina and my family were cordial but not close. \n\nNate\u2019s parents passed within a year of each other almost a decade ago. They split all they had 3 ways for their 3 \u201ckids.\u201d\n\nFive years ago Nate\u2019s older brother decided to join a monastery. He left behind all of his worldly possessions to Tina and my sons though my sons mostly got things of sentimental value while Tina got things of more monetary value.\n\nI think my in laws were all within their rights to handle their money as they saw fit. My problem is Nate.\n\nYesterday Nate told me he had a rough idea of how he would like his possessions taken care of. Basically he would like to split all he has 3 ways: Tina and our 2 sons. We don\u2019t have a lot but Nate has his parents\u2019 inheritance and he would like to give that to all his children equally.\n\nI asked him how was this fair? Tina was adopted by his parents and already received her inheritance as their daughter. If his parents gave him and his brother half and half, I would understand why he felt the need to provide Tina with something. \n\nAs it is, Tina already took from his share of the inheritance. Moreover his brother also gave her money and valuables worth more than our sons received. Tina is also a dentist. She is in no way in need of financial help.\n\nNate said at the end of the day Tina is his biological daughter and it is only right that he left her something.

That's fair. \n\nWhy would anyone be upset by that? \n\nEven if her grandparents didn't adopt her and they chose to give her and her dad half of everything she should still get a part of her father's inheritance,  just like her brother's.

It's the same inheritance but it is *being given by different people.*\n\nIt's fine if OP wants to argue that her stepdaughter be kept out of the will for whatever reason, but if it isn't her money she doesn't have much say.

She never had her bio parents raise her, her adoptive parents died when she was young and she got to watch her father start a new family without her.\n\nIf he didn't pay child support (which he wasn't obligated to since she was adopted out) OP should just consider this money as the money he should have already spent on his daughter. \n\nI think it is sad that she doesn't have a relationship with her father's new family and perhaps her father as well.\n\nTina is just as much the daughter of OP's husband as is her two sons.

Should she get something from Nate, sure, but I can also see why OP is frustrated that he would divide it up equally between those three. Especially if the inheritance is large enough that it's a lot of money for her to get twice, which it must be because I can't see someone being *this upset* over $10,000! Also feels like something a couple should decide together, assuming the inheritance is at least partly shared between the couple?? Why would someone not write a will and get some input first.

They need to see a couples therapist and accountant about the will anyway, they should have made one before now. Also is OP not getting any money in the will? \n\nETA he said \"all he has\" so that definitely implies not just his inheritance... which is quite different tbh, is he considering joint money in that or just half of the inheritance?? Because half should go to OP anyway and she can divvy up what she wants, if they live somewhere that the surviving spouse gets most of it. It's quite a weird situation.

It sounds like you're jealous of Nate's sister (daughter) as you talk about what's \"fair\" and reasoning \"she's a dentist\". None of this matters. You need to remember that Tina is Nate's daughter and he thinks of her as such. Leaving his inheritance to all three of his children is not about money and is about symbolic gesture. Tina is one of his three children and loves then equally, therefore, the inheritance is split equally. This is not a hill you want to die on. You're asking him to choose between you (aka, what you think is right and fair) and his daughter., think about it.", "YTA - He gets to decide how he divides his assets when he passes.

You're not wrong that if Tina got a share of her parent's money,  I think the rest should be passed down to your kids. And any marital assets should be spot on a way you both agree to.  I notice the phrase \"his posessions\".  After a lifetime of marriage,  most of the possessions belong to both of you - inheritances aside if he did not comingle them.   Unless you have some sort of agreement for how much of the assets you each own,  the bulk of the assets are marital, not just his.   I hope when he serials off his possessive,  he's referring only to his sole and separate property.\n\n He's not wrong to want to leave her something though,  to acknowledge the fact that she is,  in fact,  his offspring.   There may be ways around this conflict though.  \n\nWe just did our wills this year.  We each have a separate one,  which names each other as prime beneficiary.  From there,  it goes mostly to our child,  with a carveout to go to some other people we care about.  We agreed,  so both read the same as far as that goes.  BUT many of our assets - 401K, life insurance,  bank accounts,  can have a named beneficiary, to whom they go no matter what the will says.  You might consider whether you have any accounts or life insurance on which you can name your sons as a partial beneficiary.  This would even things up a bit,  though it may cut him out of money he'd otherwise receive.  Still, if he IS wanting to leave an unreasonable share to her,  and won't meet you halfway,  this may give you something you are in control of to balance the scales.", "Why are we blaming OP for the relationship between a grown man and his biological child?

While each son would get 1/9 instead of 1/6. Tina has very much gotten her fair share already by being adopted, and her getting more from her biodad does lead to a very unequal outcome that I'm not surprised OP is pushing against", "OP said he wants to split all he has. The lion's share of that is the inheritance from his parents because they overall don't have much. \n\nThe problem I have with this is that he is making his will now in case he dies in the near future. In the near future life looks like this: his sister has an inheritance, an established well paying career and no financial struggles whether OP lives or dies. His sons are a decade younger, no established career yet, maybe still in school or training etc. and maybe reliant on their parent's support as people their age often are in the current economic situation. \n\nSo if he dies tomorrow his sister will be fine no matter what. His sons will likely struggle and struggle even more if they only get a third instead of half. A decade down the line things may look different. If they all have jobs and financial stability at that time I don't see a problem if he changes his will to include his sister. But right now? It feels unfair to split a limited resource three ways when one of them doesn't really need it. He could give his sister some sentimental items to show that he is thinking of her.", "Fair point. I hadn't considered minors.", "Her \"fair share\" as a grandchild is 1/9th, which is all she is getting from her bio father. Her adoptive parents also gave her a child's share.. because she is  both.

It\u2019s also naive to think their sons haven\u2019t been benefitting already from their father\u2019s inheritance and family income. Sons are 22, not 16. Just because Tina is a dentist doesn\u2019t mean she is drowning in wealth. No matter what OP comes off as entitled because they want more for their sons over Nate\u2019s biological daughter. Whether he raised or not, it\u2019s his prerogative how he wants to split the inheritance among his children.", "I guess I just disagree that she's both, and should be considered both regarding an inheritance question. She wasn't raised by her grandparents while remaining her biodad's kid. She was adopted, and while the situation is complicated, probably raised calling her grandparents mom and dad and her uncle/dad brothers. \n\nThe purpose of the inheritance is to distribute wealth to descendants in a way that everyone would broadly agree is fair. One person out of three getting around half isn't fair, so regardless of the weird loopholes that exist in this scenario, one person getting around half should be avoided. \n\nShe was adopted and legally isn't her biodad's anymore. She's not legally entitled to his share and already has received her legally owned one from her parents. There's no ethical reason to give her more like her needing money or the sons being brats that the father was looking to disinherit anyway. What does giving her more at the end of the day accomplish except drama and perhaps a lighter conscience on biodad's part? How is putting her *back* on the table as a daughter when she seems to have until now been raised and considered a sibling not the more difficult, confusing and emotionally draining road?\n\nShe had active parents, one can only hope, in the form of her adoptive parents! As well as good sibling relationships. And in any case, emotional issues should not be solved by piling a bit more money on top so there's nothing to even out here - those are different playing fields. If biodad wants to reclaim her as a daughter, that's his call, but he should 1) start with that and let the inheritance come from that place once they reach it rather than starting with it and 2) not be surprised that it makes huge waves with his wife and sons, and that doesn't make them assholes either.", "> It\u2019s OP that deems it unfair because her sons got items of sentimental value whereas Tina got items of more monetary. That comment alone shows me OP\u2019s motive. It\u2019s all about the money.\n\nWell, at least now we have established that no, sentimental items and money are not equal, no matter what you claim, since the suggestion of Nate giving his sister sentimental items and his sons money doesn't seem to be to your liking either.", "Why are you so personally invested in/offended by all of this?
