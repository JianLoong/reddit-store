He assured everybody in the family that the social worker had given him a plan and a path forward to getting his children back, and he was holding down a really good job and etc. Then, last September, he borrowed a bunch of money again to pay his bills, and ghosted everybody.\n\nLast night, he started blowing my phone up trying to get a couple of hundred dollars from me because he had wound up stranded in a major city (he says he was chasing a lead on a really good job and it just didn't pan out) and needed a way to get back somewhere where he knew people and wouldn't be on the streets.\n\nwell, last week I found out that he had been lying to the family about his CPS case, and his kids had been given up for adoption. He had told the social worker that nobody in his family was fit to raise a child, and so the children were adopted outside of the family, two separate families. This is in spite of the fact of the numerous conversations I had with him Wherein I told him that I would be more than happy to adopt or foster his kids until he got his life together and that I was financially and mentally stable enough to do so. \n\nWhen he started calling me last night, I told him to go screw himself and that he was dead to me. I told him I would never forgive him for giving my niece and nephew up for adoption outside of the family when there was a home ready for them if they needed it, with a direct relative. He admitted that he lied to me about the situation, and lied to social services, but that I have no right to judge him because I've never had kids of my own.

I told him not to contact me again for any reason.\n\nNow I have family members calling me an asshole because I left my baby brother stranded on the streets of a major city when I could have helped him, and for judging him when I've never been in his shoes either as a parent or in life in general.

He has to live with that, and as a consequence of that, people aren\u2019t going to want to help him. And with his history, how could you ever possibly trust him that this isn\u2019t just an attempt to scam you out of money?", "Don\u2019t feel bad. I doubt your brother was telling the truth about the reason he needed money. Sounds like an addict lie.

It\u2019s funny to me in an awful way, but he still treated me really well for an addict.  He didn\u2019t steal from me I think bc our dad did (didn\u2019t think he\u2019d get caught robbing my piggy bank). I didn\u2019t skip over his bad shit. I did call him on his shit, but always said I loved him no matter what. I did love him. I visited him in prison after he bashed a guy with a pipe. I was like what are you trying to do drug addict clue?\n\nHe once texted me while I was living with my mom and her partner asking to come in. I was like not my house can\u2019t let you in. Sorry. I\u2019ll come out and chat a bit. I\u2019m doing grad school work. He had a taser that looked like a gun and to hold it to his head to threaten to kill himself. Went on for many hours. \u2026. He\u2019s been dead now for 6 years and I miss him so fucking much even after that mess. I kinda want to kick him and hug him all in one go.", "Definitely NTA.  Why didn't these family members help him?  Your brother is not your responsibility,  they are free to help him as much as they choose to. \n\nYour brother is a screw up,  a major one.   Until he does the work and changes his life,  you need to be careful with how much you deal with him.   Don't let him mess your life up.  If he doesn't care about himself nor his children,  you know he can't care about you.  So you must first and foremost,  take care of yourself.   So if that entails going no contact, then that is what you must do.", "NTA.  Time for scorched earth. Tell these concerned asshole relatives what really happened to your nieces/nephews.  Tell these sanctimonious pricks that until they get the kids back then they can all go eff themselves.   The Bank of OP is clised forever!", "Nta. All the concerned family members can pony up and leave you out of it. Don\u2019t hesitate to block anyone problematic", "NTA.

They may never be able to see you or their other bio relatives again even if they're adopted into a healthy household. Your family needs to stop coddling his behavior. There is never a situation where it's okay to choose drug addiction over your own children. If I was you I would go NC. Definitely never give him any money ever again.", "NTA. I can understand totally why you feel this way. He sacrificed his children for his wallet. If they'd moved in with you, then he'd be less able to treat you as a ATM. By pretending they were still in the picture, then he could keep asking for money and weaponise their needs. But he deprived them of a known foster which would have kept them together.\nSo don't let him tell you it is your childless status that means you can't understand. You are both childless now by choice but he's the only one that sent his children away.

Straight up, I am not responsible for how she leaves this world.", "Talk to cps, maybe the adoptive families wouldn't mind their kids having an extra aunt.", "NTA. Glad you stood your ground here. Sorry to hear about the children. Separated when they could have been together if your brother just wasn't such a prideful asshole.", "NTA!  Let those people calling you out give him the money.

Ask your family who is currently mad at you why they didn't send him money..\n\nDon't worry. Your opinion on the matter sounds well founded and well reflected. \n\nNTA, obviously.", "Do it. Let them know what has been happening with him and SO and you offered his children a place in your home where they could stay together and with a relative but he blew you off. Let them know that you are still willing to take in the children and if that is not possible then you would like to see them as should be your right. Seek legal advice over ALL of it, you may need to go NC with everyone to get custody but you wouldn't know because they wont tell you.Child Welfare can be hard to deal with in any country so know your rights and if you do get them make  sure any partner you get knows you are a package deal. Good luck.", ">I didn't know that I would be allowed to.\n\nIf you aren't the CPS will tell you. And seeing your brother gave them up for adoption is he no longer their legal guardian, so he can legally do fuck all about what happens between you and the CPS.\n\nPersonally I'd contact the CPS and see if you get an opportunity to explain the entire situation. Might lead to nothing, but unless they are already adopted you are offering an easy solution for the CPS.", "NTA ask the family if it was disrespectful to the kids for their father to throw them aside like trash just for drugs??", "The irony of some of your family members bitching you out for abandoning your brother, while he abandoned his own kids. Hell nah.", "NTA. The family members who think you are can bail him out .", "NTA\n\nHes all the man he's ever gonna be .. self centred and a disgrace", "He's the baby of all of my siblings.

He went off in pursuit of his latest high and wanted you to pay for it. It's so obvious. NTA.", "NTA and just stop. Stop. His mouth is moving. Lies are coming out. Maybe the kids are better off out of his sphere of manipulation, or maybe you can still reach them, but go hard core no contact with him. You can not save him.

Can you contact their case workers or talk to a lawyer about visitation?", "Also someone who wanted to maintain the illusion in front of his family that things were getting better so he could keep swindling them out of money as long as possible.\n\nThis man literally let his kids be adopted by strangers purely for profit.", "More this^^^ unless the kids were actual babies it's unlikely that they actually got adopted already vs just being fostered. So many kids stay in the foster system until they age out. Just because bro lost custody doesn't mean that there's no hope left for OP.", "Thinking he was dealing with CPS. OP offered to foster or adopt the children.", "NTA - and those family members pressuring you are the same ones enabling him and helping him to continue to harm himself.

And your relatives' attitudes explain exactly how it's been able to go on this long, they're enablers", "Nope. NTA. At some point your family needs to let him find his bottom.

I am sorry you are going through this and I am sorry you lost your niece and nephew.", "NTA\n\nThings are hard on your brother because of stupid choices that he made.

It sounds like a huge issue here is they still emphasize the \"baby\" in baby brother. He's been bailed out and let off the hook so often he's never had to grow up and face his mistakes. That's not on you nor is it on you to constantly save him.", "NTA It is super hard but sometimes you just need to let someone fail. You can not rescue your brother. He is grown adult.

He would be dead to me too. NTA.", "NTA- if your family thinks you are then why aren\u2019t they giving him $?  He\u2019s a liar and has done nothing to earn your and anyone else\u2019s trust.

I feel for you as I\u2019m sure you wanted more than anything to help your brother.  But how can you know if the money is really to help him get home or just to score drugs.  Addicts will tell you anything to get the next fix.  \n\nFamily can be damn near impossible sometimes, because some people use it as a guilt trip to get what they want.  I hope he cleans up and you can reconcile.   In the meantime it is not your fault or responsibility.  \n\nBiggest heartbreak is the kids.  Man that makes me sad.  I have always wanted kids and never been able to have them, so hearing someone giving them up to strangers when a family member wants them is about the saddest thing I can imagine.", "INFO: who are these family members and why are they so far up your brother's stinky a$$?", "NTA, tell everyone what you told us here.", "WTF? People saying You're the AH? Wrong you are NOT TA. Stick to your guns.", "NTA\n\nDoes anyone in your family honestly believe the reason behind why he is stranded in a different city??

Good for you for not enabling his behavior anymore.", "I'm so sorry for your loss. At some point though, a person can't save someone who never wants to be saved so while I imagine your grief and guilt are enormous, I too have lost someone after no longer being able to help them, that's not a good reason to keep enabling someone.
