This would mean that the 3 of us would be living in the same space for close to 3 weeks. I said that I wasn\u2019t comfortable with this because this was a much longer period of time than I had thought she would be staying for. In addition, I would be starting a new job then where I would be WFH in the apartment. My partner seemed upset that I was not ok with this because her mom would sleep outside on the couch at night so there wouldn\u2019t be a change in our sleeping arrangements, and that her mom could stay out of my way in the day as much as possible by being in our bedroom or leaving the apartment while I worked.

I understand why she may be frustrated, but considering the mum is more willing to pay for your BNB away from home rather than just paying for her own makes no sense. I could understand if this was spoken about prior but it was not", "NTA - 1 it's your home and you don't have to justify why you don't want to have guests staying for several weeks.  2 if you're wfh then mom needs to be out the apartment before you start work and not returning until you're finished work.  Staying out of your way 'as much as possible' isn't a thing.", "NTA\n\nWe have a 140 square meter house and my MIL goes on my nerves after 2 days.\n\nYou even get Cabin Fever if you are with people you love, but with a MIL?\n\n\"Besuch und Fisch stinken nach 3 Tagen\"", "NTA. The two of you share a small apartment. I'd be surprised if either one of you were comfortable with an additional person staying there, especially for an extended period of time. It's not practical.", "NAH\n\nI think the AirBNB is a great compromise for a special visit situation.  It lets your partner visit more with her mom and gives you the space you need.  \n\nI do recommend making some actual time to socialize with your partner and her mom and not disappearing entirely, but otherwise this sounds quite reasonable.", "INFO: how long has it been since her mom has visited?", "I mean you\u2019re NTA for wanting your own space but also how often does your partners mom visit from overseas? I can see why your partner would want her mom staying at the apartment with you guys so idk. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re assholes either.", "NTA- Its your house, your choice of not wanting another person in your personal space is absolutely fine.", "NTA.  Who visits and for how long takes two votes.  Neither has to have a reason that the other agrees with.  The legal prison space for three people is 210 square feet.   450 square feet for 3 people who are not prisoners is unacceptable.  Airbnb for you, partner pays, IMO.", "NTA\n\nI'm with you, I need my space (my mother is banned from staying with me in my house).   \nSome people are close with their family and want to spend time with each other... and depending on what culture she's from, wanting your own space can be seen as rude or strange.   \nI'd be a little worried that this might be like a... test run? Have you talked about marriage and your living arrangements after getting married? I think it's worth considering now if you'd be ok with living with your MIL after marriage. I'm sure that something like that is going through your partner's head rn.   \nIf I were you, I'd probably make sure she knows that it's not about her mom, it's simply about the small space, which seems to be the main reason you're uncomfortable.", "Overseas travel is really expensive, and while I agree that you're NTA,  this is your partners mom, and it is 3 weeks, not forever. I would try to make it work.", "NTA and why doesn\u2019t your partner and her mum go and stay elsewhere together? It\u2019s unfair to ask you to have a guest in such a small space for three weeks when you work from home and you are not ok with it. Having a guest should be a two yes, one no situation", "\n\nNo, you are not the asshole in this situation. It's totally okay to need your own space and not be comfortable with someone staying with you longer than you anticipated. Your partner and her mom should be respectful of your wishes and have a more mature conversation about it. It's perfectly reasonable for you to let them help cover the cost of your Airbnb stay, but if they disagree, that's their choice and you should find another way to get the space that you need. WIBTA if you let them contribute to the cost of the Airbnb.", "She\u2019s just visiting for a few weeks? Did you really need to make it known that you needed an Airbnb? Seems a bit dramatic, especially if you don\u2019t even have a problem with her. That\u2019s awkward. And your partner is right about the cost concerns, imo. if you have to share a small 450 sq foot apt, is an Airbnb really the best use of your $? If you really love your partner and her mom isn\u2019t annoying, and hasn\u2019t visited in 4 years then YTA for not just going with it, in my opinion. Maybe stack the Airbnb money and focus on getting a bigger apt.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s not ideal for your partner but staying in that living situation while WFH isn\u2019t ideal for you either. And it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll be gone for weeks, you can have dinner together and spend weekends together and it gives her some special one on one time with her mum.

I just think that affects the vibe of the visit in a weird way\u2026.just my honest opinion. I would want my partner to feel comfortable and spend time with her mom. An Airbnb in my opinion is like an \u201cI need to escape this unbearable situation ASAP\u201d move, is it really necessary here is all I\u2019m saying.
