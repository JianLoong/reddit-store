It lets your partner visit more with her mom and gives you the space you need.  \n\nI do recommend making some actual time to socialize with your partner and her mom and not disappearing entirely, but otherwise this sounds quite reasonable.", "INFO: how long has it been since her mom has visited?", "I mean you\u2019re NTA for wanting your own space but also how often does your partners mom visit from overseas?

It's totally okay to need your own space and not be comfortable with someone staying with you longer than you anticipated. Your partner and her mom should be respectful of your wishes and have a more mature conversation about it.

It\u2019s not ideal for your partner but staying in that living situation while WFH isn\u2019t ideal for you either. And it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll be gone for weeks, you can have dinner together and spend weekends together and it gives her some special one on one time with her mum. I think you should stick to this plan, but when communicating with your partner make sure to lead with love. This doesn\u2019t have to be contentious.", "My partner and her mom are very close, so they would rather stay together. Her mom wants to cook for her during this time too which is easier in our apartment.", "This is the first time in 4 years", "That\u2019s true that this doesn\u2019t happen often.

I just think that affects the vibe of the visit in a weird way\u2026.just my honest opinion. I would want my partner to feel comfortable and spend time with her mom. An Airbnb in my opinion is like an \u201cI need to escape this unbearable situation ASAP\u201d move, is it really necessary here is all I\u2019m saying. But OTOH, the mom couldn\u2019t just get a hotel? Weird situation", "NAH", "Yeah then it\u2019s probably just a really big deal to them, because overseas trips are pretty costly.  I was with my fiancee before for 10 years, he saw his mother once in 10 years, I had a similar situation to yours, I just kinda let it happen. Cause it was important since they don\u2019t see each other very often.\n\nI\u2019m not disputing that it isn\u2019t easy or your right to feel how you feel because been there, I totally get it and you\u2019re justified in feeling how you do.\n\nIf she was coming over every few months that\u2019s one thing but if it\u2019s gonna be a once in a blue moon thing, I\u2019d see if I could make the arrangement work, because it is only temporary. \n\nNAH.", "Then they can get an air BnB with a kitchen", "NTA. Just because she's your partner's mom doesn't mean that emotional investment automatically transfers over to you. She's a veritable stranger to you, and you're not comfortable with a stranger in your space. That's totally reasonable. Maybe sit down and explain to your partner \"I know you love your mom and I have nothing against her, but I'm the type of person that just isn't comfortable with someone I'm not intimate with in 'my space'. I know this is our space, but in my head, that means it's just you and me I'm okay with being in this very small environment. It's too much for me to have someone I don't know that well around me this much. It's nothing personal. I just need more privacy and I don't feel I have that with your mom around.\"", "YTA. This isn\u2019t a recurring situation, he hasn\u2019t seen his mom in 4 years. I agree it\u2019s not super comfortable but you married someone from a different country so this was to be expected eventually. She is visiting from overseas so it\u2019s not an option for her to just fly in for the weekend and go back", "Would you consider going to a caf\u00e9 with wifi to work ? That way, no airbnb, your so and mil don't feel rejected, and it's just for 3 weeks. I understand your needs, but your so doesn't see her mother often, and I think it would mean the world to them to see you in the evenings.", "NTA it's your home, and it's a small apartment. I wouldn't be comfortable if my partner's parents stay more than a few days either.", "NTA, but honestly they should be the ones in a. AirBNB not you. You shouldn\u2019t have to leave your home to be able to have peace and work. If they have the money to support traveling and to be able to pay for your bnb then they can go grocery shopping for the bnb that THEY will be staying in.", "NTA sounds like a trial run for seeing if they could move her mum in permanently", "This", "This is the first time in 4 years that she\u2019s visiting where we live, but my partner visits her parents yearly. I\u2019m currently away but her mom would have been there for 1.5 months already when I get back to the apartment.", "I\u2019m starting a new job which probably means many meetings so I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable working at a cafe.", "Can't they just do that in an Airbnb? Don't you need you stuff to work from home? Also don't let her out you out of your house, it's a bad precedent, trust me.", "Yta. Though it's inconvenient, when you marry someone from another country that is far away, longer relative stays are expected. You don't take a 15-20 hour flight for a few days and you see each other too rarely to not take advantage of it. Family ties also may be stronger, culturally. It is unfortunate that you have not talked about it, but you wanting mom to move out or wanting to move out yourself will be received as culturally offensive. Like you are not family. \n\nI come from a culture where a month visit is normal, but my partner comes from s culture of six-month visits and permanent moves - we discussed it early on because I know i cannot do this and better not even - it would have been a deal breaker for me. \n\nTalk to your partner. You are dealing with a cultural difference. This will continue for the length of your relationship. You cannot move to Airbnb each time.", "Oh, right. Coworking spaces  maybe ? They usually have rooms for meetings.\n\n\nAnyway, NAH.", "Her mom cooks more elaborately and requires many spices, ingredients, and cookware that\u2019s difficult to transport so I understand them wanting to stay in the apartment. I don\u2019t need that much stuff, just my computer.", "I get that. I think it would be different if we were living in a bigger apartment, but with the current size it would feel like we\u2019re right on top of each other. I would definitely talk to my partner about future visits.", "As someone living halfway around the world from my family, I would agree with you if OP was kicking mum out without an alternative option, but offering to let them have the apartment is more than generous imo.

I wouldn\u2019t want to have my OWN mum stay for that long and she\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s tiny space and you will be working there too. Plus it\u2019s your home. \n\n\nIf they can both pay for the air bnb, why are they not just doing that for her mum? That would make far more sense surely? \n\n\nPerhaps a slight compromise, say it will be ok for her to stay for a few nights. Then she can go to the air bnb! \n\n\nI can cope with two nights having someone in my space, which is quite big, before I just want them out. Even people I love with all my heart.

No worries they can move .. it should not even be discussed .. you have been more than accommodating", "Nta. That\u2019s zero privacy for quite a while.

One of the reasons why she\u2019s upset is that she would be ok if I had a family member over but I can\u2019t say I can do the same. My need for personal space is stronger than hers.", "My partner and her mom now want to extend her visit here by taking a trip together somewhere, but because my partner can\u2019t get away for some time her mom would have to wait. I don\u2019t believe my partner planned this from the beginning.", "I see. It\u2019s just odd that someone traveling from overseas would only plan to stay a few days \u2014 plus the cost of changing an international flight at the last minute.", "How about renting office space to use during the day?", "Gf is sensitive because mom will feel bad and worry her son in law doesn't like her and that she's imposing and I'm sure gf wants them to be friendly. It's generous but it's missing the nuanced family dynamics that are important... I'm surprised they never discussed it though.", "Yeah unfortunately that's the reality when family is from another country ..."]}
