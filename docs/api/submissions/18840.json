Sophie became pregnant on accident before heading to university but we dropped out and decided to step up and have her. \n\nIt has been hard to put it bluntly. We both work 6 days a week to provide for her. We're exhausted. When she was younger, Sophie would stay at home to spend time and parent her but as she got older, that gradually shifted from 4 days to also working 6 days a week like myself. \n\nThese days, Siobhan has become more vocal about the idea of Sophie quitting her job so she can spend time with her. I don't blame her, I'm sure she misses her mother. However, we don't have degrees and my income would not be enough to support my wife and child. \n\nUsually, I brush them off but she really got under my skin, claiming that her friends have proper families since that's their dynamic (one working parent). I am so tired of her taking how much we both work for granted and I snapped. I called her oblivious to how much we work and she should be grateful we can even afford our own house now (we used to live with my mother and brother up until 2 years ago). I don't see what is wrong with our family dynamic apart from the fact I work all the time. We still make time for her when we can. We pay for her to do after school clubs. We give her birthday parties and always do our best to make sure she is loved. \n\nSiobhan went to her room in tears and her uncle came to pick her up and take her bowling this afternoon.

You should have had a calm conversation with her explaining how the cost of living makes it impossible for your wife to stop working, as much as you both would love to be able to provide her with more time. Also, the fact that your daughter feels neglected is the issue with your family dynamic. As well as your response of screaming at her for expressing those feelings.", "YTA. Her response was obviously a cry for help, she stated specifically, many times, that she missed her mom, she needs someone there for her. She went from having 3 days a week with her mom to 1. She feels powerless, and helpless, and now guilty. I get that you guys are working to support your child, but there is definitely something going on where she needs someone.\n Side note: she might feel trapped in the house and feel lonely. If she isn\u2019t driving yet or able to go out much she needs to find a way to communicate with people and right now, her mom can\u2019t be that as much as she needed.", "YTA. Part of being a parent is maintaining emotional regulation and appropriate interaction with your child. Apologize to her sincerely.", "NAH. However, it may be time to re-evaluate your priorities as a family, and involve her in that discussion. Perhaps she would be happy to forego funds that are being spent on her if it meant she could have more time with her mom. \n\nMany parents feel that being able to give material goods and access to activities is \u201cproviding\u201d for a child. Some children would agree, others wouldn\u2019t. It really depends on their personality. \n\nIn your post you said:\n\n> I don't see what is wrong with our family dynamic apart from the fact I work all the time. \n\nand:\n\n> We still make time for her when we can. \n\nYour daughter will grow up once. There are no repeats. Once she leaves you can\u2019t get that time back, and you won\u2019t see much of her as she ages and starts her own family. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to guilt you. I just know that I\u2019ve never heard any senior say, \u201cI\u2019m glad I gave more time to my job than I did to my kids.\u201d", "NAH.\n\nI get that you feel taken for granted. You and Sophie are doing the best you can, and you sound like pretty good parents overall, even if you do snap occasionally. Kudos to you for trying and (mostly) succeeding.\n\nI also know what it's like to be a teenager, comparing myself with my friends who seem to have great lives, and disappointed that *I* got stuck with this family who seems to work all the hours there are and have no time for me. I too was born to parents who started having babies much too young. I spent a lot of my teenage years sulking, yelling at my mother, or staying at the house of various aunts because no one at home seemed to care whether I was there or not.\n\nBy my mid twenties or so, I had matured. I realized my parents did the very best they could. It may not have been a wonderful \"best\", but it was *their* best. They really did try. And I made friends with my parents, and we had a pretty good adult relationship. One of them has died, the other is still alive, and our relationship is very good.\n\nSo I can empathize with both you, and Siobhan.\n\nIf I can make a suggestion: when talking with Siobhan, try not to get caught up in the weeds of your and Sophie's decisions about work commitments. And stop talking about whether she should be grateful or not. It's your responsibility to provide for her, and she didn't ask to be born.\n\nInstead, focus on what's really bothering Siobhan. *She feels she's not getting enough time with her mother,* and probably not with you either. So acknowledge that. \"Yeah, kiddo, it's hard. I get that you're feeling a bit neglected, and I don't blame you. Your mother wishes she could spend more time with you, and so do I. Unfortunately, at the moment, giving up work isn't an option. We just couldn't pay the bills without your mother's job. But let's talk about some other possibilities. What things could we do together, to make the most of the time we *do* have? What activities would you enjoy?\"", "> I don't see what is wrong with our family dynamic apart from the fact I work all the time. We still make time for her when we can.

Kindness and love do! \n\nYou have one day a week with her and say you relax on that day. Is that code for: ignore and neglect? You CHOSE to have her. You CHOSE to step up. But that doesn\u2019t mean she should be grateful. We owe everything we have to our children the minute we bring them into this world! And you\u2019re angry because she is lonely and feels neglected? \n\nAt no point have you said you have apologised to her for the terrible loneliness she feels. You have only gotten angry, and justified your lack of presence.\n\nMaybe stop excusing yourself and trying to \u201cwin\u201d your conversations like it\u2019s a debate.

You'll have more free time and you might want to spend time with her. But don't be surprised if she doesn't want to spend any time with you. I understand you're tired and you work hard. But she's telling you why the dynamic doesn't work for her. She's still very young and she doesn't understand. She's not oblivious; she's just never had to support her family financially before so she doesn't understand how it works. Birthday parties occur once a year. She is telling you she needs more. One day though, she won't ask you for anything, and she won't pick up the phone when you call. Screaming at her won't make her understand. You're taking her feelings for granted; it isn't just about how this situation affects you and your wife. YTA", "YTA. I've been that way 16 year old before. Guess who cut contact with their family? Your daughter is obviously very lonely, and any parent would love to spend time with their kid. Additionally, how are you raising your kids? By yelling?

After school clubs and things are great, but your daughter wants more time with her parents.  \n\nShe's 16, she's old enough to understand budgeting and such.

It sounds like your daughter is lonely.", "YTA. \n\nShe wants to see her parents more. By the sounds of it she gets one day with her parents a week. She is crying out for affection so f**cking give her some. \n\nAlso, she doesn't need to be grateful for basic necessities. The fact you had to live with your mother and brother so long are on you and your partner. She isn't responsible for your poor life choices so shouldn't have to be grateful for the outcome.", "yta. you yelled at your child for her wanting her fucking parent. lets see if she'll come to you for anything any time soon", "The Y T A comments all seem to assume that both parents are choosing to work for some perverse need or love of working... You said quite clearly that your income alone would not be enough to support your family.  On that basis, it sounds like it would be difficult to switch to a one income home, at best.\n\nIs there any way that your wife could work less?  And still have enough household income to live on?  Are there any expenses that you could cut back on? I can't help but think you've already looked into this... maybe your daughter can tell you which luxuries she'd be willing to give up?  If she'd be willing to accept a lower budget for clothing, give up some after school activities... that sort of thing?      \n\n\nIf you've already tried reducing costs, and you both still need to work the hours you do... I can't say I blame you for snapping. You could have handled it better, but she needs to understand that you're not forcing your wife to work because you just don't want her to spend time with your daughter... you NEED to work so much to be able to survive.  I guess her friends have families where one parent can stay at home... but not all families can.  A LOT of families can't.

She\u2019s 16 now and can stand more adult conversations.

Remember that she is accustomed to having more family around than she does now and is understandably lonely. She\u2019s old enough to digest your current financial situation", "NTA. She is a teenager that doesn't understand what it takes to survive. And she does sound ungrateful, at first. But at least she's not requesting material or selfish things. Just parent time. So instead of yelling,  explain how things need to be and why. I understand your frustration though.", "[deleted]", "NAH.\n\nIt's a really difficult situation to be in.  Siobhan really does want to spend more time with you so make time for her.  It doesn't mean that you have to cut back work but it's connecting with her after work, before work and when you have a day off.  Instead of relaxing on your own, relax with her doing something.  It could something as simple as Sophie cooking and Siobhan helping, or everyone doing a puzzle together, or playing a board game together.\n\nSophie would be wise to cut back her working days (seeing as Siobhan is specifically asking this of her rather than you).  Go to 5 days or even 4 days.  But you do have to sit down with her and discuss finances and budgets with her.  \n\nQuality time with Siobhan is worth more than lots of time but no connection.\n\nI can understand why you snapped, especially if this is a common complaint.  It's that whining that gets to you.  It's the tone and it's because it's your child.  You'd be more tolerant if it was another person's kid because you aren't their parent.  And if you were tired and there was other stuff going on so your wick might've been shorter.\n\nYour child probably needs to take priority here, but you do have competing interests.  You need to be able to afford your living arrangements, and you also need to spend time with Siobhan.\n\nThis is less about the money, but more about quality time spent with her.  Birthday parties can be cheaper, she can do one or more less activity afterschool.  In fact, the afterschool activities may be impacting on the amount of time you spend with her but that will depend on what time Sophie finishes work.\n\nApologise to her.  You need to.  And you and Sophie need to talk to her and get to the bottom of this.  Maybe do something as a family when you do this rather than formally sit her down at the kitchen table.

She's increasingly turning to drink, to blot out the boredom of her days.\n\nExample 2: perhaps the father in one of those families is controlling. The reason his wife doesn't work is that he won't let her. It would be an affront to his masculinity. They paint a perfect picture of a happy family to outsiders, but what people don't know is that the family tiptoes around the father and tries to keep him happy because he explodes with rage if they don't.\n\nI have known families like these, and more.
