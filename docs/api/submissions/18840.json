Sophie became pregnant on accident before heading to university but we dropped out and decided to step up and have her. \n\nIt has been hard to put it bluntly. We both work 6 days a week to provide for her. We're exhausted. When she was younger, Sophie would stay at home to spend time and parent her but as she got older, that gradually shifted from 4 days to also working 6 days a week like myself. \n\nThese days, Siobhan has become more vocal about the idea of Sophie quitting her job so she can spend time with her. I don't blame her, I'm sure she misses her mother. However, we don't have degrees and my income would not be enough to support my wife and child. \n\nUsually, I brush them off but she really got under my skin, claiming that her friends have proper families since that's their dynamic (one working parent). I am so tired of her taking how much we both work for granted and I snapped. I called her oblivious to how much we work and she should be grateful we can even afford our own house now (we used to live with my mother and brother up until 2 years ago). I don't see what is wrong with our family dynamic apart from the fact I work all the time. We still make time for her when we can. We pay for her to do after school clubs. We give her birthday parties and always do our best to make sure she is loved. \n\nSiobhan went to her room in tears and her uncle came to pick her up and take her bowling this afternoon.

You should have had a calm conversation with her explaining how the cost of living makes it impossible for your wife to stop working, as much as you both would love to be able to provide her with more time. Also, the fact that your daughter feels neglected is the issue with your family dynamic. As well as your response of screaming at her for expressing those feelings.", "YTA. Her response was obviously a cry for help, she stated specifically, many times, that she missed her mom, she needs someone there for her. She went from having 3 days a week with her mom to 1. She feels powerless, and helpless, and now guilty. I get that you guys are working to support your child, but there is definitely something going on where she needs someone.\n Side note: she might feel trapped in the house and feel lonely. If she isn\u2019t driving yet or able to go out much she needs to find a way to communicate with people and right now, her mom can\u2019t be that as much as she needed.", "YTA. Part of being a parent is maintaining emotional regulation and appropriate interaction with your child. Apologize to her sincerely.", "NAH. However, it may be time to re-evaluate your priorities as a family, and involve her in that discussion. Perhaps she would be happy to forego funds that are being spent on her if it meant she could have more time with her mom. \n\nMany parents feel that being able to give material goods and access to activities is \u201cproviding\u201d for a child. Some children would agree, others wouldn\u2019t. It really depends on their personality. \n\nIn your post you said:\n\n> I don't see what is wrong with our family dynamic apart from the fact I work all the time. \n\nand:\n\n> We still make time for her when we can. \n\nYour daughter will grow up once. There are no repeats. Once she leaves you can\u2019t get that time back, and you won\u2019t see much of her as she ages and starts her own family. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to guilt you. I just know that I\u2019ve never heard any senior say, \u201cI\u2019m glad I gave more time to my job than I did to my kids.\u201d", "NAH.\n\nI get that you feel taken for granted. You and Sophie are doing the best you can, and you sound like pretty good parents overall, even if you do snap occasionally. Kudos to you for trying and (mostly) succeeding.\n\nI also know what it's like to be a teenager, comparing myself with my friends who seem to have great lives, and disappointed that *I* got stuck with this family who seems to work all the hours there are and have no time for me. I too was born to parents who started having babies much too young. I spent a lot of my teenage years sulking, yelling at my mother, or staying at the house of various aunts because no one at home seemed to care whether I was there or not.\n\nBy my mid twenties or so, I had matured. I realized my parents did the very best they could. It may not have been a wonderful \"best\", but it was *their* best. They really did try. And I made friends with my parents, and we had a pretty good adult relationship. One of them has died, the other is still alive, and our relationship is very good.\n\nSo I can empathize with both you, and Siobhan.\n\nIf I can make a suggestion: when talking with Siobhan, try not to get caught up in the weeds of your and Sophie's decisions about work commitments. And stop talking about whether she should be grateful or not. It's your responsibility to provide for her, and she didn't ask to be born.\n\nInstead, focus on what's really bothering Siobhan. *She feels she's not getting enough time with her mother,* and probably not with you either. So acknowledge that. \"Yeah, kiddo, it's hard. I get that you're feeling a bit neglected, and I don't blame you. Your mother wishes she could spend more time with you, and so do I. Unfortunately, at the moment, giving up work isn't an option. We just couldn't pay the bills without your mother's job. But let's talk about some other possibilities. What things could we do together, to make the most of the time we *do* have? What activities would you enjoy?\"", "> I don't see what is wrong with our family dynamic apart from the fact I work all the time. We still make time for her when we can.

Kindness and love do! \n\nYou have one day a week with her and say you relax on that day. Is that code for: ignore and neglect? You CHOSE to have her. You CHOSE to step up. But that doesn\u2019t mean she should be grateful. We owe everything we have to our children the minute we bring them into this world! And you\u2019re angry because she is lonely and feels neglected? \n\nAt no point have you said you have apologised to her for the terrible loneliness she feels. You have only gotten angry, and justified your lack of presence.\n\nMaybe stop excusing yourself and trying to \u201cwin\u201d your conversations like it\u2019s a debate.

You'll have more free time and you might want to spend time with her. But don't be surprised if she doesn't want to spend any time with you. I understand you're tired and you work hard. But she's telling you why the dynamic doesn't work for her. She's still very young and she doesn't understand. She's not oblivious; she's just never had to support her family financially before so she doesn't understand how it works. Birthday parties occur once a year. She is telling you she needs more. One day though, she won't ask you for anything, and she won't pick up the phone when you call. Screaming at her won't make her understand. You're taking her feelings for granted; it isn't just about how this situation affects you and your wife. YTA", "YTA. I've been that way 16 year old before. Guess who cut contact with their family? Your daughter is obviously very lonely, and any parent would love to spend time with their kid. Additionally, how are you raising your kids? By yelling?

After school clubs and things are great, but your daughter wants more time with her parents.  \n\nShe's 16, she's old enough to understand budgeting and such.

It sounds like your daughter is lonely.", "YTA. \n\nShe wants to see her parents more. By the sounds of it she gets one day with her parents a week. She is crying out for affection so f**cking give her some. \n\nAlso, she doesn't need to be grateful for basic necessities. The fact you had to live with your mother and brother so long are on you and your partner. She isn't responsible for your poor life choices so shouldn't have to be grateful for the outcome.", "yta. you yelled at your child for her wanting her fucking parent. lets see if she'll come to you for anything any time soon", "The Y T A comments all seem to assume that both parents are choosing to work for some perverse need or love of working... You said quite clearly that your income alone would not be enough to support your family.  On that basis, it sounds like it would be difficult to switch to a one income home, at best.\n\nIs there any way that your wife could work less?  And still have enough household income to live on?  Are there any expenses that you could cut back on? I can't help but think you've already looked into this... maybe your daughter can tell you which luxuries she'd be willing to give up?  If she'd be willing to accept a lower budget for clothing, give up some after school activities... that sort of thing?      \n\n\nIf you've already tried reducing costs, and you both still need to work the hours you do... I can't say I blame you for snapping. You could have handled it better, but she needs to understand that you're not forcing your wife to work because you just don't want her to spend time with your daughter... you NEED to work so much to be able to survive.  I guess her friends have families where one parent can stay at home... but not all families can.  A LOT of families can't.

She\u2019s 16 now and can stand more adult conversations.

Remember that she is accustomed to having more family around than she does now and is understandably lonely. She\u2019s old enough to digest your current financial situation", "NTA. She is a teenager that doesn't understand what it takes to survive. And she does sound ungrateful, at first. But at least she's not requesting material or selfish things. Just parent time. So instead of yelling,  explain how things need to be and why. I understand your frustration though.", "[deleted]", "NAH.\n\nIt's a really difficult situation to be in.  Siobhan really does want to spend more time with you so make time for her.  It doesn't mean that you have to cut back work but it's connecting with her after work, before work and when you have a day off.  Instead of relaxing on your own, relax with her doing something.  It could something as simple as Sophie cooking and Siobhan helping, or everyone doing a puzzle together, or playing a board game together.\n\nSophie would be wise to cut back her working days (seeing as Siobhan is specifically asking this of her rather than you).  Go to 5 days or even 4 days.  But you do have to sit down with her and discuss finances and budgets with her.  \n\nQuality time with Siobhan is worth more than lots of time but no connection.\n\nI can understand why you snapped, especially if this is a common complaint.  It's that whining that gets to you.  It's the tone and it's because it's your child.  You'd be more tolerant if it was another person's kid because you aren't their parent.  And if you were tired and there was other stuff going on so your wick might've been shorter.\n\nYour child probably needs to take priority here, but you do have competing interests.  You need to be able to afford your living arrangements, and you also need to spend time with Siobhan.\n\nThis is less about the money, but more about quality time spent with her.  Birthday parties can be cheaper, she can do one or more less activity afterschool.  In fact, the afterschool activities may be impacting on the amount of time you spend with her but that will depend on what time Sophie finishes work.\n\nApologise to her.  You need to.  And you and Sophie need to talk to her and get to the bottom of this.  Maybe do something as a family when you do this rather than formally sit her down at the kitchen table.

She's increasingly turning to drink, to blot out the boredom of her days.\n\nExample 2: perhaps the father in one of those families is controlling. The reason his wife doesn't work is that he won't let her. It would be an affront to his masculinity. They paint a perfect picture of a happy family to outsiders, but what people don't know is that the family tiptoes around the father and tries to keep him happy because he explodes with rage if they don't.\n\nI have known families like these, and more.

She can be introduced to the family budget at this age\u2014just make it clear she is not responsible for any of this; she was your choice and having her in your life is the most important thing. \n\nAlso, you and your spouse can think about going back to school and maybe share that with Sophie too. I\u2019ve heard stories about kids and a parent sharing a class or two at the local community college. Talk about a good way to bond.

All I wanted was to be with my mom. So I made sure that's what my kids would have. It's tight and we aren't well off but my kids are loved and never complain for attention. You screamed at your child for reaching out and she may never do so again, that is dangerous for a child to not be able to count on their parents.

That would have made you an asshole because that was not her choice.\n\nIt's hard for kids to appreciate hard realities like you are facing, and sitting down with her and showing her the financial situation is a better option than yelling for a kid her age, but I think your frustration is fully reasonable and understandable.", "I'm going to go with ESH leaning towards N T A. You probably shouldn't have shouted, but she's 16 years old, and is more than old enough to understand that you both have to work and can't be with her all the time.

The problem is not you working too much the problem is that your daughter thinks she can have her lifestyle the way it is now and still have one parent at home full time. You as a parent need to teach her why her life is the way it is now. If shes unhappy and wants it to change she needs to understand that in order for it to happen she will most likely have to give up some of her luxuries. Shes old enough to get a part time job, let her see that its not easy to make money, pay bills and support a family. \n\nI sympathize that she misses her parents speaking as someone who grew up in a third party household. It wasn\u2019t ideal but I made the most of it and I had to get a job at 16.

Does she have a plan to pay for her own college? \n\nAlso make it clear that even if she's on board with that idea, her mother isn't obligated to comply. However if her mother is also unhappy and there's room in the budget a reasonable compromise might be working 5 days instead of 6 so she is around on the weekends.\n\nIf she just wants to be like other kids that will probably shut it down. If she's really missing her mother, she'll be eager to problem solve and appreciate the effort.\n\nYTA specifically for shouting though it's understandable. Sometimes what teenagers need is a dose of reality.", "I get the frustration at her not understand your working because of necessity. She\u2019s getting upset because she just wants to be with her parents and see you guys more. She\u2019s a kid and is going to have a self centred out look.

It sucks that we live in a world where supporting a family means you and your wife working 6 days a week at the expense of not seeing each other or your daughter. \n\nI hope something changes for the better - a raise, a new opportunity, a shorter commute - whatever would help. My hopeful brain wonders if maybe you\u2019re putting pressure on yourselves to work harder to provide things that your daughter  would happily forego to see more of you. But likely that\u2019s something you\u2019ve already considered. \n\nAnd your need for rest is legitimate. Is there any chance that you could find some restful things to do together?

I and my bf are in the same boat, we work a lot to make sure my ss are taking care of and we have a roof over our heads, it is hard for them to understand, especially for the younger one because his mom usually was laid off from work a lot when he growing up.

Mother and father had nighttime shifts since i was 4 months old.", " NTA you lost your temper. Apologize and explain what she asks for is unreasonable.  Tell your wife to back you up. This is a team approach now.", "Info:  What do you guys do after work? Are you always on your phone with work calls? Do you say you\u2019re tired and you\u2019ll talk later?", "They need an exit plan.  While they were living with his mom and brother would have been a good time to pursue certifications or credentials that would let them get a better paycheck.  When their kid first started school would have been a good time for that.  If OP and his partner have spent the last 16 years working non-stop without an exit plan for poverty?  That's not good financial planning.", "This should be higher. My mom stayed at home, but didn\u2019t give emotional affection/attention to us. She instead gave us gifts/things which was her love language. However, that\u2019s not *my love language* and I remember being constantly sad as a teen. I didn\u2019t want stuff I just wanted quality time and conversations that extended beyond \u201chow was your day\u201d. Gifts feel like a cheap cop-out to actually spending time with/loving your kid. \n\nThis is your only chance because once they become an adult you aren\u2019t going to magically have quality time together. She will likely move away, and the foundation that you did or didn\u2019t build when she was a teen will be the basis of any relationship you guys have for the rest of your life.", "Lol you hang out with a lot of wealthy seniors on their deathbeds? I'm betting you don't.", "I think you come over so condescending. Maybe they literally cannot afford to work less? You've basically told them to do so when it might not even be possible.

I\u2019ve attended more deathbeds than most.", "They continuously brushed off her comments, in OP's own words, so of course she was going to keep talking about it. She had no reason not to. No one explained why it wouldn't work until they snapped and yelled at her. OP is definitely the AH here.", "it\u2019s so \u2026 privileged to want a parent to stay at home as a 16 year-old. like if parents had multiple children, then are they expected to put their career on hold for 20+ years ( from the birth of the first child to the graduation of the last child)? \n\nlike I\u2019d support the daughter if she just wanted her mom to cut down her hours but now she\u2019s just expecting too much and it\u2019s no wonder that op snapped when he did", "Here's the thing though, when you're the parent you are the one who always has to keep a level ahead. Even if you need to remove yourself from the situation for a moment to breathe and calm your thoughts, yelling at your child is lazy. Snapping at your child is lazy. That's all there is to it. Your child does not have the emotional maturity to differentiate between different kinds of yelling. While they might say they understand, emotionally they're not going to be able to grasp that concept yet.\n\nThey're the ones who decided to step up and actually be a parent to Siobhan which is amazing, but that also comes with dealing with them asking the same questions over and over and over again without snapping, that means dealing with having them question the family dynamics if they aren't similar to all of their friends without snapping. That requires a more level head than what OP has exhibited. Up until now they were doing great, but snapping and yelling at your child is not okay. Especially when they're feeling the way I'm feeling, which while she might have after school clubs and birthday parties and what not, what she wants right now is more for parents time. She is allowed to express that, without fear of being yelled at. If she gets yelled at for expressing she wants more time for parents, she's soon going to stop requesting that all together and then OP's going to be on here asking why his daughter doesn't want to spend any more time with him.", "Show her where and how she would have to live if mum gave up work, maybe have her make a few sacrifices now to see if she is happy with that. If she is, downsize etc. Maybe she really would rather have less and parents around more? Or, losing her phone, clubs, holidays etc may make her think again? All I do know is that, for some, there's more to life than material things. However it could also be a teenage reach put for attention to something\n\nNTA.

Calmly explain the situation to her again (yes, I know it\u2019s tiresome) and tell her that if she wants more time with her mom, she may need to compromise in other ways, like maybe a tighter budget on clothing, less allowance (if she has allowance), less of her favourite snacks in the house and less money for outings with her friends. You\u2019ll have to tell her that you won\u2019t be able to afford some of those things if her mom isn\u2019t working as much. And make sure to let her know that this is not a punishment- it\u2019s just the reality of the situation. \n\nEven just cutting one day out of your wife\u2019s work schedule per week and just dedicating that one day per week for her to spend time with your daughter would do wonders to help this situation. But that means that you won\u2019t be able to afford other things, so tell her that.

Kids understand more than you realise. I had this same exact thing explained to me when I was much younger than your daughter and I understood.\n\nETA: your daughter is old enough to get a casual or part time job.

Your comments make it seem like you resent her, maybe solely for not understanding your choice to prioritize work (and **relaxing**) over her, but it feels like you resent her for your choice to have her.
