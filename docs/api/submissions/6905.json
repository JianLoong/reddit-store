If something happens while the door is locked it's going to take longer to get to you. The problem isn't the door though! The problem is your husband does not respect your request!

Your husband should bother you less. But you can't blame him for worrying about you. Installing a lock without talking to him about it sucks. He's scared for you.

He's seen you naked, and nothing sexual is going on by his being there, and the shower curtain for privacy still exists... What exactly is wrong? Are you just offended he's treating you more fragile now? Because that sounds like more of a 'you' ego problem, for not admitting that yes, you are a bit more fragile right now, and it's totally okay and understandable that you are. It's also understandable that you would be frustrated by that, just not at your husband. He knows you're not the infant, if that's what you were worried about.

And honestly, he's your husband, one of the only people where it's acceptable for him to see you naked and in the shower. Not like someone else here barging in your bathroom and making the lock a necessity. Yes, you are allowed to have privacy concerns and the ability to shower alone, but going behind his back and requesting someone help you physically bar your husband from a room in his house is excessive, and could be stemming from some general paranoia and heightened emotional responses from your pregnancy.

But usually it just comes without warning.\n\nThis is why locking yourself in the bathroom while you take a shower has always been forbidden at our house growing up and I still don't do it now - it's dangerous, the shower/bathtub/bathroom is one of the worst places to have an accident in, and people need to be able to check on you and help you immediately if you're someone who's prone to fainting, slipping or having balance issues.", "She had told him many times not to enter the bathroom when she\u2019s in there. He has ignored her request. He\u2019s the asshole, and so is her brother.", "I tell u not to come into bathroom. \n\nU keep doing it?\n\nSounds like wife has been communicating and husband  not listening", "What do you not understand about OP ASKING for privacy? She did communicate, multiple times. Her husband isn\u2019t getting the message so no, she is NTA.", "Inseminating someone does not allow you to supersede their privacy and bodily autonomy. Full stop.", ">Put a chair under the knob of the door to block it.\n\nBrilliant idea, so now if she does faint and becomes weak, he'd have to call the fire department to get her out and to the hospital. Possibly losing the child in the process.\n\nVery well thought out ideas you have here. Have you been responsible for anything beyond a goldfish?", "Yeah that\u2019s a great idea. Then they\u2019ll need the fire dept if she passes out, good call", "She has asked him to not come in. She has communicated. He ignored her. Why keep trying if he\u2019s going to disrespect her anyway?", "This is the comment I was hoping for.", "She has told him to stop coming in. He hasn\u2019t.", "Maybe she just wants some privacy? Maybe she went behind his back because telling him to his face wasn\u2019t working.", "Guess she forfeits any privacy rights she had until he decides to abide by her wishes that he not come in.", "Basically\n\n1 - Hormones make brains work in mysterious ways.\n\n2 - They could just shower together, idk.", "Agree with all of this.\n\nOP say you get a lock and then something does happen, how would you feel.\n\nYou need to explain to your husband that you want some privacy, but a good compromise would be for him to stay in your room just in case.\n\nHe's probably just anxious, would you rather he didn't worry at all.", "Then he needs to stop coming in constantly when it isn\u2019t required. Then a lock won\u2019t be needed.", "Just because she is pregnant doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not entitled to privacy.  She is not an incubator. She has tried to set a boundary and he is repeatedly ignoring it.", "OP literally said she was getting lightheaded which is why she originally asked her husband to help. Now she\u2019s better and wants privacy.\n\nWhy does it matter what changed? She stated why in the post. She is entitled to have her privacy when she asks for it.", "Yes. I don't get as lightheaded as I did when I asked him to be there now and when I do get lightheaded it's not nearly as bad so I don't need help anymore or him checking up on me constantly. \n\nThere's no lock so I've never locked him out but he also wouldn't constantly walk in for no reason in the past like he does now.", "I know my husband would've said no if I had asked him and I have no idea how to do it myself.", "I think that the shower chair is the best solution. In my experience I've never been able to call for help before fainting so I don't know if the medical alert device would be useful. But sitting down while showering is a great idea. \n\nAnd she needs to stop locking herself in the bathroom. It's very dangerous. She could faint and hit her head or other body parts and he wouldn't be able to get to her quickly. I get reinforcing boundaries but there are less stupid ways of doing that.", "He comes into the bathroom. I don't care if he's in the bedroom while I shower. It\u2019s fine for him to be worried but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fine for him to come in multiple times after I\u2019ve asked him to stop.", "Best thing for me too I would go get somone who actually loves me and is not afraid to show their naked body", ">He never had this issue with boundaries before\n\nWe don't know this.  \nIt could be a bad situation or it could be just a good husband overreacting.\n\nI'm definitly more on the cautious side but it definitly is not nice, that they are laughing about her need for privacy", "If she locks herself inside the bathroom how is he gonna get to her even if she manages to call for help before fainting (which, and I speak from experience, is unlikely)?", "I love how all of your responses are fixated on \"stay out\" type mentality.\n\nOp literally displayed light-headedness and raised the concern with her husband. She may think it's all done with now but unless this is her 4th kid and every single one has been the same experience, she has no way of knowing if she's going to have issues again.\n\nNow should he be in there MULTIPLE times each shower? Not at all unless op is taking a extremely long shower. But checking up once or even just a simple head pop into the bathroom for a \"hey hun everything all good?\" Isn't something to be mad with. Hell some people wish someone else would give a fuck like that.\n\nYes op is entitled to privacy and if her husband is constantly stepping on that she has the right to ask for him to dial it back. But he also has every right to be worried or concerned about her AND THEIR UNBORN CHILD as many things can occur in a very short period of time.\n\nPersonally my wife got covid and mostly suffered from dizy spells and light-headedness. When she asked me to be aware of this and keep an eye out that's what I did. If she was alone somewhere for a long period I checked on her, before she got up to do things I got up to be close by in case something happened.\n\nWhen she felt better and no longer had those symptoms I trusted her to tell me if she was feeling it again, but I still looked out for her awhile after that. I wasn't always hovering or invading her space but I was there and she was aware I was ready if something happened.\n\nIt's just called caring for your partner, now if ops husband is just coming in everytime she's showering, ripping open the curtains to take a look then leaving, that's when I'd get where she's coming from on wanting a lock. \n\nBut I'll be honest op you sound like a fool to be getting a lock just so your partner can't come in, because heaven forbid you ever need them to come in and now you've stopped them from getting to you in a reasonable time.\n\n OP I have no judgment for you aside for this being silly, if he's just looking at you naked he can knock it off, and you can grow up considering YOU MADE A CHILD WITH HIM, getting a lock on the door is dramatic and will only further cause issues with you both primarily if the reasoning behind it is to stop him. Not only that if you should happen to fall or experience the spins or anything while locked in there he's gonna have to break the fucking door down to hope to help the woman and child he loves.\n\nTalk with your husband, figure out if this is him being worried or him being a perv, if he just wants to know you're okay then you guys need to find a compromise, if he just wants to see you naked tell him to knock it off and show him a tit once in awhile or something.\n\nY'all act like you're negotiating with a terrorist when talking to your own spouses wtf. Why did you make a life together if you can't handle a conversation.", "Are you saying that, as a husband, you get to invade her privacy to sneak a peek? Gross.\n\nYes, safety needs to be addressed. I recommend commenting on that.", "Seriously?  So she\u2019s 100% sure it will never happen again?  Sorry, she\u2019s an idiot who has no idea what might happen in the future and is endangering herself and her unborn child to keep her HUSBAND from popping in now and then showing love and care on his part.  Good grief, my husband and I are almost ALWAYS in the bathroom at the same time.  It is totally weird to think that husband coming in is \u201cpervy\u201d.", "That\u2019s fair. But she\u2019s still being an AH by going around him like this to make a change to their home. I could see ESH, but there\u2019s no getting around her being an AH.", "Every single fucking time a woman posts on Reddit about how she tried repeatedly to communicate with a man and he just ignored her and kept doing it, all the comments are like \"you're not communicating! You need to communicate! You can't blame him because YOU didn't communicate!\"", "What kind of marriage is this where the wife needs utter privacy while showering?  Maybe after she has kids she\u2019ll see that privacy in the bathroom is a thing of the past.  It\u2019s just totally weird to me to even expect that your spouse will stay out of the bathroom while you\u2019re showering.  Usually my husband is in the bathroom while I\u2019m showering (and vice versa) because we BOTH have to get ready.  This is not some big \u201cviolation\u201d.", "\"stop\" and an actual conversation are two different things.", "Sounds like he\u2019s just worried about you.\n\nSince there\u2019s no lock just tell him you\u2019ll call if you need him, or leave the door slightly ajar as a compromise. \n\nI can see both sides. Communication is key, but how easily that key works is 99% the delivery.", "Consider if roles were reversed. Would he be uncomfortable enforcing his boundaries? Would you feel comfortable disrespecting his boundaries? \n\nOf all the people in this whole wide world, above everyone else, your SPOUSE should respect your boundaries. You are under no obligation to maintain a relationship with anyone who does not respect your boundaries.", "You have bigger problems than a lock on your door, but, uh, a six year old could figure out how to swap doorknobs.   Pro tip, you can find videos on youtube on pretty much ANY minor home fix it job.     But as far as a lock on the knob?   Unscrew.  Put new knob in hole.  rescrew.", "Ur husband is disrespectful of u", "If he stops barging in then she won\u2019t need to lock the door!", "Did you just graduate junior high? A stable partnership usually entails seeing each other naked. That's how grown ups do it. \n\nSafety is more important than her slight discomfort. She'll live.", "Redditor thinks sneaking a peek at your wife is wrong wait until she find out I watch my gf naked anytime I want and even touch her whenever.", "She's uncomfortable with it. In fact, what if becomes a safety hazard? He comes in, startles her, and she slips? Just because it's normal for you doesn't mean it's normal for everyone else. You seriously think she's not worried about her baby? That's why she asked her husband in the first place. But she's feeling better now and seems to know her own body. A healthy  marriage has boundaries. She let him know hers and he crossed them.", "It's a new doorknob, not an addition on the house. There absolutely IS getting around her being an AH. She's a person who wants to be able to shower alone and communicated that desire very clearly, it's INSANE that you think that makes her an AH.", "She\u2019s going around him because he isn\u2019t listening!", "She can\u2019t make changes to their home? She can\u2019t shower unattended, is she his prisoner?", "Nice to know that you\u2019ve decided you represent everyone.", "My mother always had privacy washing when I was a child growing up. Bathroom doors had locks, and we all used them and respected one anothers privacy. Not everyone is free and easy when it comes to using the loo or washing. I would have been given shirt shrift if I had expected to join her as a child.", "You're right. If you're a wife or a mother, your body belongs to your husband/children and you no longer deserve the basic right of privacy. Even asking for it makes you an AH", "So, she\u2019s married and has given up any right to privacy she\u2019s ever had?", "Telling him to stop at is all she needs to say.", "Since when do you need a dissertation to get basic privacy? Do you think stop is enough to stop sex, or do you need a conversation for that as well and if you don't get one you can do what you want? It's her body. She doesn't consent to being seen naked. That's it.", "He's barging in because he's worried. And I agree. The shower is one of the most dangerous places in the house for someone with low blood pressure or other issues that cause fainting/balance problems/slipping etc, and it's even more dangerous for a pregnant person. And it seems to me that she's downplaying the risks and not taking his fears seriously.", "Sorry, still think it\u2019s weird, and weirder still to ask brother to install a lock.  Pretty sure she could google a video.  I\u2019d laugh at her just for that alone.", "Doesn\u2019t matter. She\u2019s putting herself and their baby in danger.", "You\u2019re welcome.", "If I was downplaying the risk I wouldn't have asked him to come in the shower with me in the first place.", "If he stops barging in then she wouldn\u2019t need a lock!", "So ESH, cool. Glad we can agree."]}
