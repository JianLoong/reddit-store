Because that sounds like more of a 'you' ego problem, for not admitting that yes, you are a bit more fragile right now, and it's totally okay and understandable that you are. It's also understandable that you would be frustrated by that, just not at your husband. He knows you're not the infant, if that's what you were worried about.

And honestly, he's your husband, one of the only people where it's acceptable for him to see you naked and in the shower. Not like someone else here barging in your bathroom and making the lock a necessity. Yes, you are allowed to have privacy concerns and the ability to shower alone, but going behind his back and requesting someone help you physically bar your husband from a room in his house is excessive, and could be stemming from some general paranoia and heightened emotional responses from your pregnancy.

(He told the owner he thought something was up. Owner's wife was pregnant and high risk so he took it seriously)\nShortly after that I admitted I would get dizzy but I was fine. (Work gave me a chair and so on less walking around and cleaning tables)It got better in my second trimester, so put the chair back and went back to normal because I was \"better\" until I wasn't. X kept an eye on me and one day while standing at the register I was starting to feel woozy, he noticed and put his arm around me and guided me to a chair and sat me down. I would have fallen and probably hit my head on our stone walls or the \"marble\" if it weren't for him being concerned. He wasn't even my husband and he was worried.

The problem isn't a lock, the problem is with your husband. You obviously needed his help before and now you don't, but your husband still worries. Rather than locking him out, you should of come to a compromise. Such as getting a bench in the shower incase anyone needs to sit (hell, it would be nice even for shaving). Or setting up a system where you tell him you're taking a shower and he's allowed to come check up on you after x amount of time has passed (if you regularly take 10 minutes, then at 15 he can knock at the door). It was an AH move to disregard his concerns and try to lock him out, and to have your brother keep the secret. Husbands also an AH for not listening to you and respecting your feelings.

Your husband's concerns are valid. While you deserve privacy, you are having health problems and you're still lightheaded.

I had low potassium a few years and passed out in the shower. I hit my head hard enough to give myself a concussion. And I don't know how long actually passed until I got oriented enough to get out and call someone to take me to the hospital because I lived alone. It's a real concern and can be very dangerous. And you're married with a kid on the way. Stop trying to bring your brother and father in to \"fix\" things or \"install\" things behind your husband's back. You both need to have an honest conversation about why this is important to both of you. Because obviously he is having some major concerns you are brushing off.", "ESH. OP needs to acknowledge that she isn't completely out of the woods as far as the lightheaded thing goes. Husband is invading privacy, and brother sounds like he enjoys stirring up drama. I'm pregnant and I have had some difficulty with my blood pressure and feeling lightheaded. My husband's main concern is our baby. He allows me to self evaluate the risk and I make him aware of anything going on. This all boils down to communication, and there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of it.", "ESH?\n\nYou're N T A for wanting privacy but putting a lock on the door is just a recipe for disaster. You're still pregnant, and even though you say you don't get lightheaded as often, this implies it still happens sometimes.

Why not buy 1-2  privacy stands (fabric inserts) to shield you from view if someone else is in the bathroom?  Also grab bars and padded floor/tub mats   eta    Yta", "I personally think soft YTA, as you\u2019ve had problems with being light-headed in the very recent past while pregnant. Locking the door while you\u2019re showering is already a bad idea in case you slip and fall, and doubly so when you\u2019ve been having dizzy spells while pregnant. Try thinking from his perspective about this, he\u2019s just trying to ensure you and y\u2019all\u2019s baby are safe", "Not saying YTA, but your husband isn\u2019t one either.\n\nI don\u2019t really get why you\u2019re so upset about your husband checking up on you, when you told him how scared you were about being left alone while showering. Then, instead of actually talking about this with him- his apparent \u201coverreaction\u201d to his pregnant wife possibly fainting while in the shower- you ask your brother to install a lock\u2026 while you\u2019re **still** having this issue. \n\nWhy don\u2019t you talk to the doctor about it, with your husband there to both listen & express his concerns, and the doctor can help you figure out a solution (shower chair, etc) that helps put both of you at ease?", "This might sound harsh\u2026 but I don\u2019t think you really thought about this very well through.\n\nInstalling a lock on the ensuite door is not hard.  It\u2019s like a easy 5 minute job even for a newbie.  Even if your brother complied to your request, your husband can easily take it off and put the old door knob back on.  In fact it\u2019ll probably spark a huge argument about the subject where everyone is worked up, feels disrespected and feels angry overall.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t blame your brother for not wanting to get involved when this issue can be resolved if you and your husband just learn to better communicate with one another.  \n\nMy suggestion to you is that you should really talk to your husband and find out the root cause of why he keeps disregarding your request.  Try to understand his perspective and try to actually make him understand yours.\n\nPersonally, I can see why your husband is being overprotective.  I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right.  It\u2019s just some people tend to get very protective related to pregnancy - especially if they feel worried about the mother putting themselves in unnecessary risk (even low).  I know when ever I got pregnant my family treated me as a delicate thing (even though prior to my pregnancy I moved furniture for them and am physically stronger, healthier and active than them).  It\u2019s not because they don\u2019t think I\u2019m capable anymore.  I think it\u2019s more of the fear that if something was to happen my baby while I\u2019m doing something on their watch that they\u2019ll hold onto some sort guilt that they\u2019re somehow responsible as well.  And that might be the same for your husband\u2026 that if you suddenly fell in the shower then he probably will feel guilty he wasn\u2019t around to immediately provide assistance.\n\nSo while I understand that it\u2019s extremely frustrating for you, overall I think ESH.  Talk to your husband and really try to find an actual solution that you both can understand one another.  The whole door lock will only make the situation worse.", "I'm going to say ESH, your husband is ignoring your request because he is worried about you. Putting a lock on the door when you're a fall risk is not smart. How your brother and husband acted to your request was childish as well.", "I don't understand.  Why does it bother you if your husband is in the room with you when you shower?  My husband and I walk in on each other all the time, sometimes we shower together.  It seems to me that your husband is concerned about you.  After your baby is born he probbly won't feel the need to constantly try to keep you safe, so why not humor him while you are pregnant?  I should think it is a good thing that your husband cares about you.", "OP: I agree that the lock could be a problem if you do pass out. But there are some compromises you can make: \n\n1. I have POTS and showers can be hard, turns out hot showers make it worse. If you are noticing this problem particularly in the shower but not other standing instances, try lowering the heat. You can make the shower a little colder, turn on the bathroom fan or open the shower curtain/door a bit. That might reduce the instances. \n\n2. Buy a shower seat. The agreement is the seat is always in the shower when you shower, if you feel light headed you\u2019ll sit down and in exchange he won\u2019t come in unless you call for him. \n\nI agree that him not being able to honour your request is a him problem, but I also get that he\u2019s scared for your safety. So a compromise to help his fears but means he STOPS coming in it\u2019s fair in both sides.", "Really? He\u2019s worried about his pregnant wife, because she was getting lightheaded and dizzy in the shower, and you expect him not to keep checking on her?

You guys are acting like he\u2019s doing it just to peep in on his wife and not thinking about the fact he\u2019s worried about her and their childs welfare.

I understand (as a mom myself) that you want your privacy and you feel like you're being treated like a child (but you're also kind of acting like one, ignoring safety issue), but that's life. You need to go ahead and prepare for all your privacy to be gone. You'll have the bare minimum at the hospital, and once the kids is here it's gone forever. You will not go to the bathroom by yourself for years.

If price is an issue, there tend to be a good number of second-hand shower chairs out there. I'd recommend looking for one on a garage sale site or at estate sales. \n\nAs for shower temperature, heat is a vasodialator. When your veins dilate, it can cause your blood pressure to drop and pooling in your legs, making you dizzy.\n\nIf you don't want to sacrifice your hot showers, I'd recommend getting a blood pressure cuff to double-check that you're not too low. Also, keep an eye out for flushing (redness) in your legs and feet. Flushing is a sign of blood pooling and that your blood is not where it needs to be to keep your blood pressure up.\n\nI have also been a caregiver. I get the issue on both ends but, ultimately your autonomy comes first. I have some other suggestions for you and your husband. \n\n1. Get a door with a lock for your bathroom so you can have a sense of privacy. It isn't a safety issue as long as the door has a key. I recommend hanging the key outside the door and keeping it there unless the door needs to be unlocked.\n\n2. Implament knock checks with responses. These can be done on a schedule, for example- every 10 minutes or as needed - if your husband becomes anxious. If you don't respond, he can use the key to check on you.\n\nOnce you have the baby, it could be a while before you are able to shower in private.

Having a seat for chores really really helps me focus and makes sure I'm comfortable. So I use a seat whenever I can. I also really can't stand being too hot or too cold, I genuinely can't focus on anything that's happening even when appropriately medicated because of how my brain is wired. I can try to push through but I will be so horrifically miserable and in so much discomfort that it can ruin my whole day and take a day to rebound. So my accommodations are being able to control the temp and having a seat available. It's not what everyone needs, but it's what works for me. \n\nPeople with ADHD also often struggle with balance/clumsiness. I bought a special drink carrier (the spill not if anyone is interested) so that I wouldn't have to worry about spilling a little bit of tea, but using it over the holidays and my sister made fun of me. The same sister that also mocks me pretty mercilessly because I'm clumsy no matter how hard I try to be careful.

I would like to ask if he would step out if you asked? \nBecause keeping the door unlocked makes sense, if you are in trouble you can scream or it would be audible and he'll be able to enter the bathroom. But straight up entering just because he can, that's just disrespecting your privacy. \n\nPeople on these replies acting like just because op is married the husband can do whatever.

You realized you needed help in the shower in the first place when you first started having symptoms, so you asked your husband to help you. Now you say you no longer need those accommodations even though you still have some dizzy spells. If you say you can take care of yourself during one of these dizzy spells, I believe you. I have dizzy spells in the shower when it gets too hot sometimes, and I know what to do about those: turn the hot water down and sit down if necessary until it passes. If it does not pass, I can call out to my boyfriend and he'd be able to help me from there. I don't understand why people think you can't do the same, unless I missed some details. Being pregnant doesn't  mean you aren't capable of helping yourself during a dizzy spell and your husband should know this. Everyone should know this. I trust you because you asked for help when you needed it. Not trusting you now probably means you won't do that next time and that will be a real tragedy.", "Some of the comments in this thread literally make me sick.\n\nYou are 100% not the asshole!! You have the RIGHT to shower in peace. You asked for help when you felt like you needed it. Your husband is crossing serious boundaries by not respecting your wishes now. You should not have to continually ask him not to come in. No means NO. And this bullshit about you being wrong for wanting a lock because he won't respect you? Lady, you can MOVE OUT and get a whole ass apartment with a lock. You are not an incubator with no autonomy whatsoever. You do NOT need a chaperone if you don't want one. People are off their rocker here. You wouldn't even ask for a lock if your husband respected you. HE is the one creating dangerous situations.\n\nAnd you know what's \"dangerous for the baby\" - CAUSING THE MOTHER STRESS. \n\nAlso, those two jerks *laughing at you* when you're being so disrespected that you have to ask for a lock just makes my blood boil.\n\nI'm sorry for how you are being treated here AND in your own home. My heart goes out to you.", "NTA. The only people who are AHs are the husband for not respecting boundaries, the brother for laughing at her for having boundaries and anyone here who thinks women should lose all body autonomy when they are pregnant. \n\nSure, locking the door is a bad idea, but the only reason the OP is that desperate is because he is not respecting her boundaries. \n\nWould it be great if everyone was comfortable with casual nudity? Sure, but it\u2019s not reality. Some people have sex with the lights out and for the husband to never give her a moment\u2019s privacy, no matter how much she asks for it is frankly, disturbing. \n\nThe fact that he and the brother laughed to her face about it makes it seem like he\u2019s enjoying her discomfort rather than it coming from a place of concern.

It's not safe.\n\nHe's being AH for walking in after you asked him to stop. You established a boundary, your husband should respect it.\n\nYou're being AH for wanting to lock the door and endanger yourself before coming up with better, less dangerous solutions, and for going to your brother before your husband about the lock solution. Shower stool, telling him he needs to knock first and wait for you to answer and he can only come in if you don't, telling him he can crack the door and ask without coming in, literally just tell him you are going to put a lock on the door if he walks in on you one more time so he understands how serious this is? Seriously, there were so many better solutions than asking your brother to install a lock.\n\nAlso, I installed a new doorknob with a lock on my bedroom door when I was a teenager about 20 years ago, without needing the internet. You would have known that you could easily do it yourself without having to involve your brother (unless you have some physical disability, which would have been relevant to mention, and might even absolve your husband of some guilt), if you'd bothered to google it.", "YTA you had him come in to make sure you didn\u2019t pass out, but now you think that\u2019s not going to remain a concern of your husband?", "I think all three of you need to sit down and have a conversation about boundaries, fears and trust. Your husband is being overprotective and stepping on your boundaries, your brother is violating your confidence and trust, and you are invalidating your husband's fears. Remember that you and your husband are a team and that he is coming from a place of love. This does not excuse his behavior but it is good to get the full context so you and your partner can communicate to each other how you feel in a healthy way. I think you will get through to him how much you want privacy and he will get through to you how concerned he is for your safety. Compromise is a wonderful thing!\n\nYou are NTA but, woof.. your brother sure is. He disrespected your feelings and needs by laughing about it and violated your trust by minimizing and joking about your feelings. He really needs to understand the gravity of the situation.", "Eeeww. This perspective is so icky. OP is a person who can make choices for herself, regardless of her pregnancy, and she\u2019s asking for privacy. If she wanted to take a walk in the garden, but had a bee allergy and didn\u2019t have an epipen on her, that would be unadvisable, but COMPLETELY her choice and her choice alone.  \n\nThe husbands concern does NOT mean he can do whatever he want to soothe his anxiety. How TF did we come up with this one? He must still exercise the rules of consent.  And just because other husbands out there on Reddit are worse, doesn\u2019t not make this guy right. \n\nInvolving a supportive third party in your life when your partner is doing anything non consensual to your body is completely founded. I encourage anyone who is being abused to do so. It\u2019s great that OP has someone she feels comfortable involving. \n\nOP you\u2019re NTA, but be careful if you don\u2019t want to fall in the shower", "Thank you!
