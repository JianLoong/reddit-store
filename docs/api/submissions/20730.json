He said you are not invited. Why is your mom defending him and calling you petty? What kind of support does your mom think he needs??  He clearly doesn\u2019t care whether you show up or not. Why go where you are not wanted? On the day, go out and have fun with your friends instead.", "NTA. He himself even said no when asked if you were invited. Why would anyone want to go somewhere that they are not wanted. Your mom needs to respect your stance. How can she say you're a bad sister when your own brother didn't even invite you? Is he the \"golden child\"?", "NTA, if your brother said you weren't even really invited then there's no world in which you're a bad sister for not going. The only reason I would consider going, and in your situation it might not apply, is if it'd make a huge difference to your parents. If you attending the wedding is the difference between your mom and dad being happy and proud on their son's wedding day, vs. sad that you're not there together as a family, I'd consider going, not for him but for them.", "NTA. He neither personally invited you, nor did he acknowledge inviting you when asked. His respons of \u201cno, but she can come if she wants\u201d speaks volumes. \n\nYour mother wants you to go because it makes her feel better to have both of her children present. But you are under no obligation(s) to go, especially given the history between you both and the fact that he could care less if you attend.", "Absolutely NTA. As others have said, *you were not invited.* (And why did your mother have to tell you verbatim what he said??)\n\nCan you *suddenly* have a babysitting job that day or get a summer job and *suddenly* have to work that day? \n\nYour mother clearly wants to look good to the rest of the family because no one wants the \"support\" at their wedding of someone they don't like and haven't talked to in 2 years. \n\nHe caused you to develop an EATING DISORDER. Of course you don't go!", "NTA.  It\u2019s unfortunate you are a minor at home with two \u201cadults\u201d who enabled a bully and who now demand you go support him, even though he still doesn\u2019t want you around.  You will likely have to go and play nice because of the enablers.   Seems unlikely you will have any friends or close relations at the wedding and will have to be a potted plant.    I hope you can reduce interaction with all three after reaching 18.", "NTA. You're not being a bad sister, he's being (and has been) a bad brother.", "NTA. Why would you come to his wedding as unwanted not invited guest? Your mom should call him bad brother, not you.", "\u201cno but i guess she can come if she wants\u201d is not an invitation, it\u2019s a dismissal and simply appeasing your mom. Decide if you want to support your relationship with your mom, but you don\u2019t need to support your brother in any way.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Sounds like you have a bad mother since she won't respect either of your wishes.", "NTA\n\nYou not going to a wedding you weren\u2019t actually invited to is being a bad sister but bullying you and not inviting you to his wedding wasn\u2019t being a bad brother?! It\u2019s pretty clear who the golden child is in your parents\u2019 eyes. My guess is that they are hoping/convinced that you two will get along better in the future and they think that you will regret not going to his wedding. It\u2019s possible, but considering how your brother acts towards you even as an adult, I doubt it.\n\nI think you should decide whether or not angering your parents by not going to the wedding (or fighting them about it if they force you to go) is worth it overall. Maybe, but maybe not since you\u2019re still a minor who lives with them. In any case, you\u2019re not an AH whatsoever no matter what you decide.", "NTA! Good lord. No one is ever an asshole for not going to a wedding they're not invited to!\n\nTell your mother that while you understand how important it is for *her*, you do not feel welcome and hope she has a great time without you.", "NTA, why should you go to the wedding of someone who made your life a misery? You aren\u2019t obligated to go. You weren\u2019t invited anyway so why would you go somewhere you won\u2019t be welcome? \n\nYou\u2019re not a bad sister, he\u2019s a bad brother and he reaps what he sews.", "NTA\n\nTo be fair, even if you and your brother didn\u2019t get along, you should still go, because that is a big part of his life, however, singers, he made it clear you weren\u2019t really invited, that\u2019s an extra person they have to pay for, and they didn\u2019t plan on you going", "NTA. You weren't invited. That means, at a minimum, that he doesn't care one way or the other if you're there or not. \nJust because you share genetics with someone doesn't mean you have to support them when they've been an abusive dick.", "NTA. For your own sake, you should not be in contact with him in all honesty. Sounds like really unhealthy relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He'd probably use the opportunity to bully you some more. I hate families who expect the victims of bullying to be nice to their bullies, either to appease the bully, or for \"how things will look\" and \"people will wonder why you aren't there\".", "NTA. Your mother is a bad parent. She let him bully you and now she is pressuring you to go to a wedding that you aren't wanted and you don't want to go.", "I'm a firm believer in never going anywhere when it's obvious my presence isn't desired. Your mom just wants you to go because she's afraid that your relatives may ask why you're not there. Stand your ground and insist in staying home. NTA", "NTA your mum and brother are , a parent what allows their child to be bullied to the extent of an ED , is absolutely disgusting! \n\nI can just tell that your son was the golden child and her precious little boy", "You're not being petty or a bad sister.

NTA.", "[deleted]", "Hold up, so you overlooked the brother physically and mentally ABUSING OP, and giving her a freaking eating disorder, but THAT was where you deemed it OK for her to not have to go to her abuser's wedding? That's cold.", "NTA. He didn't even invite you. He merely said you could come if you want to, which you don't. Your brother is the one being a bad sibling, and your mom should be pissed at him instead.", "NTA- You're not invited and you don't want to go. Case closed.", "NTA- You're not invited and you don't want to go. Case closed.", "NTA - \"she can come if she wants\", we she does not want to. End of story.", "It's your Mom who wants the support.  My Mom is super shy and every time there is a baby/wedding shower on my dad's side I have to go with her.  Luckily we are all close and it's no big deal if I come (they are always thin on sending invitations - it's usually a phone call).\n\nYour Mom probably just wants the moral support when dealing with the new in-laws.  Still\n\nNTA", "NTA. When asked, your brother's immediate response was that he does not want you there. What part of that is your mom not understanding? If she is going to address anyone in this, it should be your brother, who at seven years older still is a bully to a much younger sibling. The time to 'heal the rift' was years ago, not at his wedding that he doesn't want you at. Your mom is definitely the AH here. How is it petty to not go where you are not wanted nor invited? I see where your brother gets his shitty attitude from.", "NTA.  Stay home and enjoy the day.  Your brother clearly didn't intend for you to be invited - so why should you make an attempt to go?  Parents don't understand that their kids aren't always going to get along, and your brother sounds like a real jerk.", "NTA, simply tell your mom, as she already knows, you were NOT invited."]}
