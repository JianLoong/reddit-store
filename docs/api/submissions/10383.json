But when I noticed, I wasn't too bothered. I didn't want to miss the flight over it, it was a once in a lifetime trip. \n\nPlus it was no big deal because I'm used to going without a phone, I grew up before cell phones were universal, and my family's from a rural area that doesn't get service to this day.\n\nI thru hiked a lot of the Appalachian trail before I got my first phone, just relying on paper maps and a willingness to ask strangers for directions. And I've taken a road trip through the US and Canada where i dropped and broke my phone and I had to use paper maps to get home.\n\nSo I'm honestly super used to being without a phone, even when solo traveling, so it was a non issue for me.\n\nBut my boyfriend has a super different relationship to his phone, he's just 4 years younger than me but he grew up wealthier in a major city, and his parents bought him a phone as soon as possible, for his safety. \n\nSo he was anxious and freaking out at the airport and trying to figure out if we could somehow contact the Uber driver, and get the phone in time. I said it wasn't worth possibly missing our flight, it was an old piece of shit and I'd buy a new one after the trip. \n\nHe said he was worried for my safety without one and I was like \"but we'll be together?\" And he was still worried because he knows I'm an earlier riser than him and I enjoy a morning walk or jog \n\nI said I could get a burner at one of those shops that sells SIM cards to tourists if that'd make him feel better, and he did want me to.\n\nBut on the trip, he got annoyed at having to stop after the flight to buy a phone, and complained about how shitty of a phone it was since it was just a flip phone and didn't even have maps. I said it would still be good for emergencies, I'd save his number and the emergency numbers. \n\nAnd throughout the trip, when I'd take pictures with the flip phone, or when he'd look something up because I didn't have data, he'd make all these petty comments about how I was so irresponsible. \n\nAnd I'd get annoyed because I didn't see it as irresponsible, I know how to travel, and I'm not even stressed solo traveling without a phone, so being together it was absolutely a non issue. \n\nHe said I was inconsiderate, because it's not just something for me, it's something to let my friends and family and him know where I am and that I'm safe. \n\nI was like 'my friends and family know I drop off grid time to time, they don't worry anymore.

Don\u2019t recommend therapy for him.", "[deleted]", "ESH...\n\nLike a wedding, when you plan a big event very often you have really high expectations. It's possible your boyfriend had very high expectations for this trip and this unplanned hiccup really through him.\n\nIt sounds like the two of you can do a better job about communicating. It would have been great if he could have expressed his frustration in a better way such as I'm so looking forward to this trip and now I'm a bit mind jacked with this issue on the phone. I'm not comfortable without a phone and I'm projecting that on to you. It would also have been great if you had said listen we have your phone, I could buy a burner phone, my friends and family have your contact information and as soon as we land I will reach out to them and give them the new temporary phones information let's enjoy our time together.\n\nI hope you enjoyed the trip and perhaps can work on your communication as a couple", "NTA.    \nFor a whole month? Did he complain the whole time? As someone else suggested, next time leave him in the uber.", "NTA.\n\nHis reaction to your competence in the face of unexpected events kind of reminds me of the recent flood of AITA posts from wives about their insecure husbands mis-titling their jobs. Like he's projecting his own insecurities onto you or something.", "NTA i rarely by data or wifi while traveling myself and have always been fine when with another person", "NTA. The only point he might have had here was a safety concern and being able to get in contact with one another while traveling. But you had a perfectly reasonable solution for this. Accidents happen, things get lost. His reaction was completely unreasonable. Also, whether or not you were or weren\u2019t in contact with friends and family was none of his business.", "NTA you honestly handled it super well. Just tell him to pretend he's on the amazing race", "NTA lol I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to be with someone like this long term tbh imagine 50 years of this? Over everything. While I get why he was stressed at first but he should\u2019ve dropped it, it\u2019s not something you can do anything about after the fact and you found a solution so there is no point in him continuing to bring it up, there is no further resolution to reach, what\u2019s the point in him continuing it?", "NTA. \n\nFirst, you are a hero. I'd have a full meltdown if I left my phone in an uber and I was about to fly internationally. But you are also totally right- your boyfriend has his phone so you can alert people you don't have yours and you two will be together so you won't be fully off the gird. \n\nSecond, you didn't even make it his problem as you bought a flip phone that worked for you. Sure, he had to look up a few things, but he was part of what was being looked up. When my partner and I travel, I have an international option and his is very expensive, so he uses wifi and we use my data, so I look up stuff sometimes and it certainly never bothers me. \n\nThird, shit happens. You don't say in the story that you have a history of losing phones, or that the phone prevented you from getting on the plane or creating any real work for him. You handled losing it with grace, and the only disruption it caused him was one extra errand, which always happens on a trip anyway (someone forgets a toothbrush, a shoe breaks, etc). \n\nI'd be so remarkably annoyed if my partner ruined an entire trip by not being able to let go of something that had such little impact on him.", ">I said I could get a burner at one of those shops that sells SIM cards to tourists if that'd make him feel better, and he did want me to.\n\nYTA. ~~And then you didn't.  He's not your bodyguard, and you being without a phone put him in the position of either sticking to you like glue or worrying the whole time.~~ You having only a burner put all the onus on him for anything more complex than dialing a phone number or taking a photo.\n\nIt doesn't matter what **you** are comfortable with here, you're not travelling alone.  But you would be, going forward, if I were your partner. Find a like-minded travelling companion, there are plenty of people who enjoy going off-grid.", "You two sound incompatible.\nYour reaction was perfectly normal and healthy. He sounds too controlling and mean. \nYou deserve better. \n\nI dropped my phone in the ocean in Honduras at the beginning of a vacation last year. I was able to retrieve it, but it was bricked for the rest of the vacation. My boyfriend and I had a good laugh about it and enjoyed our time together.

Honestly, life wasn\u2019t even worth living. I can\u2019t imagine finding happiness and fulfillment through anything other than my phone.\n\nAnd here I am about to fly on a plane. Thank goodness for airplane mode or I would try to jump out mid flight.", "NTA. Your boyfriend sounds exhausting", "Nta, personally I'd flip about the phone being in an Uber but not at you and I certainly wouldn't shit on your efforts for it. Ever. He's being ridiculous", "Girl. C'mon now. This guy sucks.", "NTA but hopefully you\u2019ve since thought about leaving HIM. Seems like there\u2019s a bigger issue here\u2026", "NTA sounds like a fun vacation", "NTA Sometimes a guy will tell you that something is for your own good, he just wants you to be safe, you need to do such and such a thing for his sake, if not for your own and so on and so forth. Not only can that get exhausting, it can also be a disguise for being controlling. Like saying you should wait until he can go with you, you are better off going with him, not alone. Or it would be better if you stayed home and didn't meet up with your friends, etc etc as it is far away, a not good area, it is dark etc. it can also start to undermine your own confidence and independence. The phone is your property, not his, if you do not care about it then neither should he. What you replaced it with is nothing to do with him either. He is far too up in your business on what you do and what you buy and gain, speaks of being very controlling. If you love travel, freedom and independence this guy will try his best to take it from you.", "NTA. Your boyfriend should absolutely not be more upset about this than you are.", "Hmmm, I am torn on this one because in this day and age, smartphones are quite integral to travelling. I think I would find it annoying if everything fell to me because the person I was traveling with didn't have a smartphone. If you were going to buy a new one anyway, why not just buy a smartphone? (Unless you're planning to get it on contract)\n\nYou could have logged into Uber on your boyfriend's phone and easily contacted the driver. If he hadn't left the airport yet, or just left and could get back quickly, you could have offered him some cash for bringing back your phone, but you didn't even want to try.\n\nSo getting directions, looking things up, buying train tickets, ordering ubers, etc. all became your boyfriend's responsibility on the trip. It's not a big deal but I can see why he was annoyed. He probably didn't need to hold onto it so long and ruin the entire trip over it though. ESH", "I was waiting until you got the full, unfettered experience before I edited it, but now we\u2019re good!", "Nta. Travel kicks up a lot of previously undiscovered character traits. \n\nHe hasn't really offered any kind of proposal about his behavior, has he? He still thinks he is correct, and being correct is a good reason to ruin a trip to friggin Italy? That's a big deal.  Yes he had an irrational, anxious response to a minor disappointment. Ok. That happens. It doesn't mean you get to get hung up on it and ruin everyone's mood forever.\n\nHas he even dropped it now? Is he going to throw this out forever? \n\nIf he can't see how he acted inappropriately and offer solutions to better handle his emotions next time... what if you break your phone on your wedding day? What if a kid drops your phone in a pool?  Should he have bought you a smart phone instead of a flip one of it was so important to him? Should he keep a spare smartphone at all times? Or should he have strategies in his pocket to process his own anxiety without blaming others and externalizing his emotions for others to deal with? \n\nHonestly though,  he really actually thinks he is 100% correct,  right? That's a big problem and one unlikely to not come up again and again.", "Traveling together definitely tests relationships, as it brings on new stressors that you have to deal with unexpectedly. It sounds like you're accustomed to rolling with the punches and can move on pretty quickly, while your boyfriend ... not so much.\n\nIt's definitely a learned trait for most people, but until then, he should understand that taking it out on you isn't appropriate behavior. What if you'd gotten sick during the vacation? Or twisted your ankle during an arduous hike? (Both of which have happened to me and my then-bf did NOT deal with it well.) Would he have held it against you the entire time? Is it fair to continue beating a dead horse? How does it help in any way? What is he expecting you to do about it--change the past? Grovel at his feet? Tell him that he's right and you're wrong and stupid and a bad person??\n\nNTA", "NTA. Is your boyfriend this controlling? Tell him to get over it.

The OP certainly is super chill about it. It's called resilience. The boyfriend doesn't have it.", "Yeah I thought a burner phone was a great compromise. I remember before cell phones we'd be on vacation and my dad would wonder off without telling anyone and we'd have to hunt him down because we had no way of contacting him which sucked so I do think something to contact travel companions in case of getting separated or an emergency is important but beyond that it's no big deal. I mean you still had his phone for maps or whatever.", "He seems super needy and slightly controlling too", "I know not everyone is this type of traveler, but personally, the best travel experiences I\u2019ve had are when I get lost and have to ask recommendations from actual locals rather than just googling. Also, when you don\u2019t have an exact minute-by-minute itinerary, you tend to find much more interesting and less touristy spots that you will remember way more than just staring at the Leaning Tower of Pisa for 10 minutes.", "Whether is tis the bf's need for control, or his anxiety, he should be working on that, hopefully with a therapist.\n\nI travel the way OP travels.  I give basic itinerary info to someone and then my wife and I take off.  NO cell phone needed (I have never carried one).  I have traveled and generally lived my non-work life without a cell; that plan works the same in other countries.  If I have questions, I ask.  That leads to great conversations with locals, rides to here or there and really being in another country instead of defaulting to English on my phone.  It is how everybody used to travel!\n\nThe only adjustment we made to travel is to have a wifi iPad with us because some countries' local information is only given as an internet address.", "The bf is either controlling or very anxious. \n\n I don't know your age, but please remember before cell phones everybody still traveled happily and stayed safe.  It is not that hard.", "Good gawd!  I buy train tickets, ask for directions, figure out menus, etc. without a cell phone in a foreign country.  It is not the necessity you think it is.  Going without your pocket computer will get you closer to the local culture, which was why you wanted to travel to begin with, right?\n\nThe bf is all anxious and thinks he (and she) can't travel without a cell.  Her many trips prove otherwise.  When he is busy with his phone, she'll simply ask someone and have a nice conversation.", "Did you ever get ahold of the driver?
