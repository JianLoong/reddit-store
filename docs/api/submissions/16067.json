I will make sure that my daughter is always safe from her biological father.\n\nEarlier this month, I was out of the house for 30 minutes, taking a walk to clear my head from all my personal stress. I came home to find that M had smashed one of our windows. While I was gone, she, for whatever fucking reason, decided to play baseball inside the house and accidentally hit the ball towards the window rather than the wall (which is still a big no-no). I snatched the baseball bat from M and asked her why the fuck she did what she did, but all she was doing was sulking and acting like her usual gloomy, angry self. I couldn't get through to her. So I made a big decision and sternly asked M if she wanted to stay with her father for the following week (I was completely bluffing). Suddenly M's eyes grew wide, and she became responsive to what I had to say. I told her \"you're going to behave now, aren't you?\" and she just shook her head and whimpered. And that was that.\n\nOver the past month, M has been gradually getting back to being her normal, pleasant self, which has been a huge stress relief for me. A few nights ago, she asked me if I really will send her to live with her father again. I became so overwhelmed with guilt, and I hugged my daughter and told her that I'll never ever make her do anything she doesn't want to do. Because that is true.\n\nHow much of an asshole am I here?

But I understand that it's very difficult to be a single parent, and you're going through a rough time. I recommend following some gentle parenting resources on social media. All available evidence shows that punitive-focused consequences does not help teach children. You should make the consequences of a child's bad behavior match the consequences they would have to face if they were an adult and accidentally made the same mistake. \n\nFor this situation: if you accidentally broke your window for some reason, what would the consequences be for you? 1, you would have to clean up the mess. So tell your daughter, \"You broke the window. Now there is broken glass, which is unsafe, and a mess. I need you to help me clean it up.\" Have her help you clean up the broken glass in a way that is safe for her, by having her wear shoes or gloves and help you sweep, vacuum, or throw it away, or tape up a tarp over the broken window to seal it. Consequence 2, now you have to pay for a new window. Say to daughter, \"Windows are expensive, now that it's broken it's going to cost XX money to get it fixed. Now we can't spend that money on anything else, which means we can't do XXX (some activity that she likes to do, or can't buy some treat that usually you buy\". Better yet, give her several options of things to forego that somewhat match the cost of the window. If she usually likes to go to a fun place, or get some treats at the grocery store, or buy toys, sit her down and say \"The window cost XXX, so we can only do/buy 1 of these things. You have to pick which one to not get, that money will go to fixing the window.\" \n\nUsing these kinds of consequences actually prepares her to grow up and gain responsibility, because she is learning the actual impact of her actions. When you use punishments like sending her to her room, or threatening her with something else, what you end up teaching her instead is to fear you, and potentially hide things from you, because she doesn't want to be punished.\n\nI hope that helps.", "YTA what the bleep is wrong with you?

Your struggle doesn't in any way justify or excuse leaving an 8-year-old child alone in your house (that's illegal in my jurisdiction; it's parental neglect), yelling and swearing at her, or threatening to send her to stay with her abusive alcoholic father. \n\nYou need to get yourself into therapy and parenting classes ASAP. You, the parent, are out of control and have adopted the role of abuser.", "YTA. You know you screwed up, so I\u2019m not going to berate you. But god, listen to how you talk about your daughter and please do whatever you can to fix how you see and treat her. Her life was turned upside down. She is not and never was a bad kid. She was a helpless child in the middle of the turmoil that you went through. She had no control over her life, and was probably very scared (long before you threatened to send her away).", "YTA. Wow. Pretty gross", "YTA.  So much.  \n\nAnd your excuse that you were going through a tough time doesn't hold any weight.  YOU are the grown-up, SHE is the child.  Of course she's going to act out in a difficult, emotional and traumatic time.  She is only just now learning how to deal with these things.  Aside from NOT HELPING with the matter, you turn around and use one of her biggest fears against her.  \n\nCongrats on creating a core memory for your child, one in which her \"safe\" parent threatens her with her abusive one to get her to fall in line with what you want.  It may be a huge \"stress relief\" for you not to have to teach your child to deal with these things, but now you've taught her that no adult is safe, she can't trust you, and that the only thing to do is make herself small and innocuous.  \n\nWhen she's 25 years old and dealing with an abusive partner, she's not going to tell you because she can't trust you.  When she's struggling with emotional issues because of trauma, she's not going to tell you because you aren't safe to tell.  \n\nTHIS is what you've taught her.", "YTA. She's 8.

I\u2019m saying this as a professional who works with young people in a mental health related capacity, as well as someone who had a mother who acted like you. That being said, you are not beyond salvation. Please seek appropriate help to better the situation because it is still possible. I have a few notes for you:\n\n1. It is absolutely not appropriate to ask your child \u2018why the fuck\u2019 they did something. Never. Not even when she is older. Your daughter may remember you speaking to her like that for the rest of her life. It\u2019s not acceptable, not even when you are going through a hard time. You\u2019re an adult and it is your responsibility to manage your emotions in a way that minimizes their negative impact on your children. I will also say that if you continue to have inappropriate outbursts towards your child, she may realize this is inappropriate on her own when she is older and your relationship may suffer. \n\n2. Your daughter is also going through a hard time. She is an 8 year old with what sounds like 2 verbally abusive parents who just got divorced. It sounds like instead of being a parent and supporting your young daughter through this trying time, you have centered yourself and your own feelings, treating her like an inconvenience when she needs you most. \n\n3. You also have verbally abusive tendencies. It is not normal or appropriate for a parent to ask an eight year old \u2018why the fuck\u2019 they are doing something. I have to wonder how accurate your vision of your ex is for this reason, since you seem biased in assessing your own flaws. I want to highlight that it is 100% inappropriate for you to use your child\u2019s father as a threat or punishment. It is also inappropriate and frankly bad parenting to vent to your child about her father (you didn\u2019t mention doing this but I have a hunch you may need to hear it.) \n\nAnecdotally, I want to add that my mother had much stronger abusive tendencies than my dad. She painted my dad out to be the bad guy when I was growing up. I realized what had happened as an adult and I now speak to my dad probably 300% more often than my mother. Kids don\u2019t stay kids forever and the average person begins storing long term memories aged 3-5. Your daughter will be able to remember how you have acted and look back at it with an adult brain someday. Think about that.", "She's never going to forget this. EVER.\n\nYTA", "YTA. You\u2019re the only secure relationship that your child has and you threaten to send her away to a person who you know is unsafe. \n\nYou have probably been preoccupied and she could be acting out as a way to let you know that she wants to connect with you.\n \nGet some help. Look into parenting classes specifically geared towards post separation parenting.", "YTA", "You tried, but you came on too strong. this one isn't believable. \n\nin the nearly non existent possibility that it is, you should see a shrink.", "YTA. \n\nAs a kid, my mother put a lot of fear into us about my father\u2026some of it true, some exaggerated.
