I will make sure that my daughter is always safe from her biological father.\n\nEarlier this month, I was out of the house for 30 minutes, taking a walk to clear my head from all my personal stress. I came home to find that M had smashed one of our windows. While I was gone, she, for whatever fucking reason, decided to play baseball inside the house and accidentally hit the ball towards the window rather than the wall (which is still a big no-no). I snatched the baseball bat from M and asked her why the fuck she did what she did, but all she was doing was sulking and acting like her usual gloomy, angry self. I couldn't get through to her. So I made a big decision and sternly asked M if she wanted to stay with her father for the following week (I was completely bluffing). Suddenly M's eyes grew wide, and she became responsive to what I had to say. I told her \"you're going to behave now, aren't you?\" and she just shook her head and whimpered. And that was that.\n\nOver the past month, M has been gradually getting back to being her normal, pleasant self, which has been a huge stress relief for me. A few nights ago, she asked me if I really will send her to live with her father again. I became so overwhelmed with guilt, and I hugged my daughter and told her that I'll never ever make her do anything she doesn't want to do. Because that is true.\n\nHow much of an asshole am I here?

Of course she is going to revert, she has no support system in her life.\n\n>she just shook her head and whimpered.\n\nI assume you got some disgusting satisfaction from this, like an abusive monster would.\n\n>I became so overwhelmed with guilt, and I hugged my daughter and told her that I'll never ever make her do anything she doesn't want to do.\n\nYeah you say this now, but this is extremely common in abusive relationships. The abuser acts all sad and guilty at the moment, but continues the behavior later on creating a cycle of abuse and reconciliation.\n\nNow lets compare you and the ex.\n\nHim\n\n>He is a deadbeat and a **verbally abusive** alcoholic.\n\nYou\n\n>So I made a big decision and sternly asked M if she wanted to stay with her father for the following week  \n>  \n>I told her \"you're going to behave now, aren't you?\"  \n>  \n>she just shook her head and whimpered.  \n>  \n>A few nights ago, she asked me if I really will send her to live with her father again.\n\nDo you see what you did to her? You instantly destroyed her by threatening to send her to an abusive monster all because you left a young little girl unsupervised. You weaponized her very real fear against her. You blamed her for your own actions and left her living in terror by threatening her with more abuse ever since that moment.\n\nMy mother would do this to me my entire life growing up, telling me to fuck off and live with my dad. Only one of the ways she would abuse me, its a big list of ways. You know what that did? Ruined my self esteem, made me feel unloved, made me realize my mom was a monster, made me realize she does not care about me. It's one of the major reasons I cut her out of my life, sadly not before becoming so depressed I thought about suicide all day every day for about 5 years straight.\n\nI don't give a shit if you are going through a tough time. You basically told you child you don't love her because you are willing to send her back to a monster. Doesn't matter if it was a bluff, she didn't know that. That was a reality to her.

You do not have the luxury of using threats to extort good behavior from your daughter. As another person already suggested, you need therapy, both of you, definitely individually, possibly as a family unit.
