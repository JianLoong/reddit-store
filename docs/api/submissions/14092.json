{"id": 14092, "submission_id": "12cxbe2", "title": "AITA for not \"supporting\" my friend's modeling career?", "selftext": "I (26F) have been competing in pageants for 8 years. I love it, I love the women I've met, I love the experiences I've had. Last year, I met Jenna (22F) at a national competition and we clicked. We got along really well and kept in touch afterwards. She lives about 3 hours away, so we haven't been able to meet up in person since then, but we chat frequently. \n\nToday Jenna went on a rant on Facebook rant, maybe 3-4 posts of multiple paragraphs, about how disheartening it is to not have support in her modeling career. Lately, she's been entering these competitions where your social media followers \"vote\" for you to walk in a fashion show. Now, I've got my own opinions on shows that make you \"work\" for it, like charging entry fees or you have to sell a certain amount of their brand to walk, but that's not relevant. \n\nJenna will participate in multiple competitions at once, meaning she's sharing 5-10 links a month and asking for votes. One of them even asked for written testimony! Most are free to \"vote\", but a few charge $2-3 per vote. I always try to vote for her when I see it come up on my feed. \n\nNow, Jenna's mom passed away last month and she started a GoFundMe for funeral expenses. I donated $100 and then another $100 later on. I sent her a message and did what I could to offer support, but my dad is battling terminal cancer at this time and with the distance, I'm not able to help Jenna hands-on. \n\nSo when she posted this rant, I didn't think it was targeted towards me. Then I saw a quote that stuck out and I can't help but feel I'm being called out. Without quoting verbatim (since I know you can search texts in posts), she basically said someone donated to her mom's funeral twice but won't donate to help her career and something along the lines of \"Who else needs to die? Why do I only get support when it's pity?\". \n\nI sent her a private message saying I'm so sorry she feels that she's been slighted by her friends and asked if there's a link or a specific way to support the current competition she's in. She read it and then unfriended me. \n\nI guess I'm just confused so I'm not sure what to do. I can't imagine the toll of losing your mom, but I also don't think it's fair to compare donations for a funeral to donations for a modeling competition.

I do pageants for fun, I don't model or anything outside of that, and most of the women I meet have the same mindset of \"I'm just here to have a good time and look hot while I do it\". There's obviously a few who take it very competitively, but I didn't take Jenna for one of those. \n\nEven if I'm not actively \"competing\" against her in these modeling competitions, she may still perceive me as a \"threat\" somehow. \n\nMaybe it's because I'm older or I've been doing it longer, maybe it's because I did have the funds to donate for the funeral, who knows.", "Pageants do \"People's Choice\" voting where each vote is $1, but that money goes to the winner's charity of choice and that's clearly spelled out. \n\nWith these competitions, the money goes to..... the brand. The brand then uses the models (without pay) for advertising. So the company just churns a profit.", "The dying comment actually made me LOL reading it back. \n\nThese types of competitions are made for rich girls to be able to buy their connections, plain and simple. You don't have to have any practical modeling experience, just have a certain look and the money. There are sooooooo many other avenues to get into modeling (open castings, networking at industry events as a spectator, reaching out to agencies, reaching out to local brands) that do NOT require a fee. \n\nI digress, though, because it's not even about the competition itself. I think what's most upsetting is that it seems she equates \"friendly support\" with \"financial support\" and that all \"financial support\" is the same across the board.", "I've seen her post a lot about looking for \"real girl friends\" and now I'm starting to wonder if she genuinely is looking for friends or just people to like and share her posts.... :(", "I did. The problem is that I donated more to her mom's funeral than I voted.", "I felt like $100 wasn't enough so I did it again.

When I was young, the racket was that models need a $1000 portfolio of professional photos.", "It sounds to me like you really were a \"real girl friend\" to her and she didn't appreciate it.

Give her all the space she wants and go make new friends.", "> She read it and then unfriended me\n\nSometimes the rubbish takes itself out. \n\nYou saw her as a friend. She saw you as a resource to exploit. Once it because clear that guilt tripping wasn\u2019t going to make you pay up, she dropped you. \n\nBe thankful she\u2019s out of your life.
