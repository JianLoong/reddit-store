We don\u2019t really get drunk just have a beer and talk. There\u2019s this new guy that started going with us who I\u2019ll call Frank(30M) and well I should put it up front that I can\u2019t stand this dude. He\u2019s really annoying, thinks he\u2019s funny, and isn\u2019t subtle about how much he isn\u2019t fond towards\u2026certain people. Other people seem to like him okay so I just steer clear of him when I can, this time was kind of unavoidable as he was sitting right next to me at the bar. \n\nSo we\u2019re talking about the football game that\u2019s playing on the TV when a man sitting next to Frank eventually joins in on our conversation by complimenting Frank\u2019s Tattoos to which Frank appreciates, we\u2019ll call him Rob. We\u2019re all having a good time and I\u2019m trying to get to know Rob more cause he gives off a good vibe which is when Frank makes a joke about whether or not Rob\u2019s wife knows he\u2019s here. Rob kinda laughs and says \u201cNo but my boyfriend does\u201d and I notice Frank gets really stiff and uncomfortable. Rob notices and asks Frank if he\u2019s alright.\n\nFrank immediately starts talking about how uncomfortable he is and how he\u2019s straight and that Rob shouldn\u2019t just assume things about people and that compliment he gave him earlier was totally inappropriate and he\u2019s not interested. Rob seems taken aback by this, I\u2019m ready to eat broken glass, everything is just uncomfortable. Rob apologizes but says he really didn\u2019t mean it that way and that Frank shouldn\u2019t assume someone\u2019s into them just because they\u2019re gay. This seems to piss Frank off a bit and he gets more aggro and defensive saying Rob should know what a compliment like that implies. \n\nI get pissed off after trying to tell him to chill out repeatedly and I snap and say \u201cYou barely reach mediocre standards for women, what makes you think gay dudes feel any different?\u201d This pisses Frank off and he gets up and storms out allowing me to keep talking to Rob who was still willing to talk with me which I appreciate. Some of our friends come by and ask me where Frank is and I just tell them idk and idc. \n\nI get a text later that night from Frank who says that my comments were totally inappropriate and I should have kept myself out of his business and I reply with a thumbs up emoji. He ended up telling everyone else at my job what happened and most of them are keeping out of it but some have come out and said that what I did, while justified was an asshole thing to do and I should apologize.

Or if you are, you\u2019re the BEST kind of asshole, and the type of asshole we NEED. Rob probably didn\u2019t feel safe addressing Frank\u2019s blatant homophobia, but you were in a safe position to defend Rob instead, so you did the right thing and stepped up to bat for him. That\u2019s ALLYSHIP. And I\u2019m saying this as a gay person.\n\nFrankly, I\u2019d keep an eye out for homophobic comments at work and keep a record of every one, and report that shit to HR. Doesn\u2019t matter how friendly and likeable that guy is if he\u2019s being discriminatory", "Ha ha ha, Frank is both homophobic and angry that a gay man might not find him attractive. Awesome.  NTA.", "NTA. You just called out his homophobic BS. Complimenting someone's tattoos is not asking them to have sex (source: I compliment people's tattoos ALL the time and never want them to rail me after)", "NTA.  Frank is a bigot and needs to learn to take whatever comes his way when he acts like an asshole.\n\nI also have to wonder if the people telling you that you should apologize to Frank think that he should apologize to Rob.", "NTA. He can go kick rocks. He immediately assumed Rob had a girlfriend then tells him \u201che\u201d shouldn\u2019t assume things. If anything you stood up for Rob in a uncomfortable situation. You don\u2019t even like Frank so him not liking you is no skin off your nose.", "NTA. You didn't come out and attack him for no reason because you don't like him, you clapped back after trying to de-escalate an uncomfortable situation (that HE started). \n\nThe whole \"gays/lesbians who say a nice thing about someone of the same sex must wanna bang\" mindset is so bizzare. Like... do these people walk around wanting desperately to fuck every person of their preferred sex? Do they only compliment people they're thirsting over??\n\nAlso the extreme offense some people seem to feel over the mere THOUGHT of someone they aren't attracted to hitting on them is... kind of sad, honestly.", "NTA + mad props. If you're the A H then so am I hahaha, I think this is exactly how bigotry should be handled. I don't have the energy to try to change all bigots' minds, but I will happily make them feel unsafe to express their bigotry in public settings.", "NTA - he is weird bully and you are right - it is ALWAYS guys who are mediocre that have these issues. Always.", "NTA I hope I remember what you said if I ever find myself in a similar situation!", "Homophobes don't get apologies for being cut down while building up to a hate crime, NTA.\n\nIf you hadn't cut in and been so clearly not on his side it would have gone badly; 100% he's upset bc he thought if he started a fight you'd back him up and when he saw the opposite was true he fled", "You're NTA. \n\n>\u201cYou barely reach mediocre standards for women, what makes you think gay dudes feel any different?\u201d\n\nThat was an epic response. It's pretty sad and pathetically self absorbed when someone like Frank just *assumes* a person is coming onto him, and only gets upset when it's someone who is not of the opposite sex.", "NTA\n\nFrank was being an AH and projecting a harmful stereotype onto Rob that all gay men are predators looking to seduce straight men. He brought it on himself.", " NTA and I love what you did! Thank you for speaking up, fr fr", "YTA- stay out of conversations that don\u2019t include you.
