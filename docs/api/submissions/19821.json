For context - X is a recovering addict and alcoholic. \r  \n\r  \nAbout a month ago, shortly after moving in and still very stressed from the move, my partner had a lapse in recovery and drank a few beers that a neighbor had left on our porch. Although he didn\u2019t get really drunk, I was worried and concerned that he drank and then tried to hide it from me. He admitted he shouldn\u2019t have drank and said he wanted to do some thinking and went and sat outside in our garden. \r  \n\r  \nI needed to talk to someone, mostly just to vent, so I called my mom. She routinely calls me 3-4 times a week to complain about her co-workers and neighbors so I didn\u2019t think it would be a big deal. The whole time we were talking she was very unsupportive and disengaged (had the TV on) and so when my phone died mid-conversation, I did not rush to call her right back. I plugged in my phone and instead of waiting for it to turn back on, I went outside to talk to X and check on him. \r  \n\r  \nWhen I came back inside (15 minutes later) my phone was ringing off the hook and when I answered, it was a police officer asking me to confirm my name and address. The cop informed me that officers were on their way to me as someone had called in a \u2018Wellness Check\u2019. I immediately called my mom and she proudly admitted to calling them. Myself and X have always been pretty vocal about our distrust of police back home.

When I told her the experience was scary for us she accused me of being dramatic and laughed at me. \r  \n\r  \nI didn\u2019t want to fight with her and flat out said that if she couldn\u2019t apologize for calling the police unnecessarily that I would no longer be speaking to her as I don\u2019t trust her anymore.

What she did was a gross over-reaction which escalated an already strained situation into something which, frankly, could have seen serious consequences. \n\n>My mom has never apologized in her life\n>she has no friends\n\nI expect those two statements are  very closely connected.", "Info - So, your husband is in recovery.

And if she's never apologised for anything in her life it's time she started.", "NTA I can understand as a parent why your mom would call 911 after you told her your addict partner had a relapse weather or not you not charging your phone is a habit. I\u2019m not fond of the police either but if I felt my daughter was in danger I\u2019d call the army if it meant I could make sure she was safe. Context is key and that\u2019s a pretty serious context. Your mom is the asshole though because she didn\u2019t apologize afterwards. If this was me I would have apologized and maybe made a joke out of how I overreacted. Also I wouldn\u2019t cut my daughter off either. So NTA", "NTA\n\nIt's unreasonable that she just chose to go nuclear by jumping straight to a police wellness check. I'm pretty sure she wouldn't appreciate that if you did it to her every time she vented about her coworkers or neighbours.", "Nta. Sounds like you should've cut her off years ago. This can't be new behavior. I'm sorry about your family", "NTA, you are not responsible for your mom's emotional or social well-being.

You just told her that your husband, who\u2019s an alcoholic and drugs addict, relapsed. You called because you were worried about this and then all of a sudden couldn\u2019t be reached. Calling the police was a bit much, but are you sure this wasn\u2019t a sincere reaction based on what she knows about your partner?", "NTA. Her calling the cops may not have been an ass move, it could have been genuine worry. But here are the things that make me think she\u2019s the asshole:\n\nShe was nasty to you, had no empathy or sympathy for how scary a borderline police interrogation can be. She especially had no forethought or empathy for how the cops treat recovering addicts; cops are always suspicious of addicts, recovering or not, and tend to treat them poorly. She assumed your partner was a danger to you, likely told the cops he was a danger to you, and that could have gotten him arrested.", "hmm idk man i mean you called your mom to tell her your partner in recovery was drinking again then suddenly the call ended...I can see absolutely why she would be worried about you.

You stated you \"Flat out said if she couldn't apologize you wouldn't be talking to her again\". In my experiences, that's telling someone off. It's a one sided mind thinking she can't see things your way and not speaking to her again until she does. It's a double edged sword; maybe you're not seeing things her way and she was genuinely concerned for you and your partners well-being when the phone died and she couldn't contact you?

It is not on you to fix your parent, but as a child who has grown up with this issue you will feel obligated to continue to be support.

They will push and you have to hold the line for you and for them.  It is hard to love them, it is hard to treat them, and it is hard to bear with them in your life.  Sometimes you have to walk way completely, but enforcing boundaries are important for you and for them.  Some can heal, but a lot of mental health help by professionals is necessary.  Mental health professionals find them draining and sometimes end up having to boot them from from practices because of behaviors.  \nGet yourself help as you have decided and get to a healthy place for you first.

It is hard to love someone who is mentally ill and it is hard to not love or not want to love a parental figure.  You have a lot of trauma you don't even realize you have.  Just like physical scars they make you part of who you are, but they don't have to be the barrier to what you will become.  \nYou can rise above and become healthier for you most of all and then for those around you, whether you choose to have your mother in your life or not.  \nBe well stranger and best wishes.", ">He is actually really gentle and that is one of the things she has criticized about him\n\nYour mom is upset that your partner *isn't* violent?
