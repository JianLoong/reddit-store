We love our new community, but X has struggled with losing our big friend group and his family from back home. My own family consists of just my Mom, and she has lived far away from me for a few years already so it has been a softer adjustment for me. For context - X is a recovering addict and alcoholic. \r  \n\r  \nAbout a month ago, shortly after moving in and still very stressed from the move, my partner had a lapse in recovery and drank a few beers that a neighbor had left on our porch. Although he didn\u2019t get really drunk, I was worried and concerned that he drank and then tried to hide it from me. He admitted he shouldn\u2019t have drank and said he wanted to do some thinking and went and sat outside in our garden. \r  \n\r  \nI needed to talk to someone, mostly just to vent, so I called my mom. She routinely calls me 3-4 times a week to complain about her co-workers and neighbors so I didn\u2019t think it would be a big deal. The whole time we were talking she was very unsupportive and disengaged (had the TV on) and so when my phone died mid-conversation, I did not rush to call her right back. I plugged in my phone and instead of waiting for it to turn back on, I went outside to talk to X and check on him. \r  \n\r  \nWhen I came back inside (15 minutes later) my phone was ringing off the hook and when I answered, it was a police officer asking me to confirm my name and address. The cop informed me that officers were on their way to me as someone had called in a \u2018Wellness Check\u2019. I immediately called my mom and she proudly admitted to calling them. Myself and X have always been pretty vocal about our distrust of police back home. Although my Mom does not agree with this opinion, she is VERY aware of it. \r  \n\r  \nFive cop cruisers showed up on our lawn - they questioned us both and repeatedly tried to force their way into our home. They ended up leaving after about an hour but their presence was very intimidating and uncomfortable for both myself and X. \r  \n\r  \nWhen the police finally left and we cooled off, I called my Mom to demand an explanation. She claimed that \u201changing up on her'' was suspicious but when I pushed back on that excuse (not charging my phone has been a lifelong bad habit of mine) she got angry and said it was my own fault, among other nasty things. When I told her the experience was scary for us she accused me of being dramatic and laughed at me. \r  \n\r  \nI didn\u2019t want to fight with her and flat out said that if she couldn\u2019t apologize for calling the police unnecessarily that I would no longer be speaking to her as I don\u2019t trust her anymore. She hung up on me and I haven\u2019t heard from her since. \r  \n\r  \nAITA for enforcing this boundary? My mom has never apologized in her life and I knew that when I insisted on an apology.

You should be calling someone from your Al-Anon group not your mom when your partner relapsed.", "NTA. What she did was a gross over-reaction which escalated an already strained situation into something which, frankly, could have seen serious consequences. \n\n>My mom has never apologized in her life\n>she has no friends\n\nI expect those two statements are  very closely connected.", "Info - So, your husband is in recovery.

And if she's never apologised for anything in her life it's time she started.", "NTA I can understand as a parent why your mom would call 911 after you told her your addict partner had a relapse weather or not you not charging your phone is a habit. I\u2019m not fond of the police either but if I felt my daughter was in danger I\u2019d call the army if it meant I could make sure she was safe. Context is key and that\u2019s a pretty serious context. Your mom is the asshole though because she didn\u2019t apologize afterwards. If this was me I would have apologized and maybe made a joke out of how I overreacted. Also I wouldn\u2019t cut my daughter off either. So NTA", "NTA\n\nIt's unreasonable that she just chose to go nuclear by jumping straight to a police wellness check. I'm pretty sure she wouldn't appreciate that if you did it to her every time she vented about her coworkers or neighbours.", "Nta. Sounds like you should've cut her off years ago. This can't be new behavior. I'm sorry about your family", "NTA, you are not responsible for your mom's emotional or social well-being. From the way she reacted, it sounds like her choice to call the cops was malicious. There were so many other things she could have done to check up on you.", "INFO Couldn\u2019t it be that your mother was sincerely worried? You just told her that your husband, who\u2019s an alcoholic and drugs addict, relapsed. You called because you were worried about this and then all of a sudden couldn\u2019t be reached. Calling the police was a bit much, but are you sure this wasn\u2019t a sincere reaction based on what she knows about your partner?", "NTA. Her calling the cops may not have been an ass move, it could have been genuine worry. But here are the things that make me think she\u2019s the asshole:\n\nShe was nasty to you, had no empathy or sympathy for how scary a borderline police interrogation can be. She especially had no forethought or empathy for how the cops treat recovering addicts; cops are always suspicious of addicts, recovering or not, and tend to treat them poorly. She assumed your partner was a danger to you, likely told the cops he was a danger to you, and that could have gotten him arrested.", "hmm idk man i mean you called your mom to tell her your partner in recovery was drinking again then suddenly the call ended...I can see absolutely why she would be worried about you.

You stated you \"Flat out said if she couldn't apologize you wouldn't be talking to her again\". In my experiences, that's telling someone off. It's a one sided mind thinking she can't see things your way and not speaking to her again until she does. It's a double edged sword; maybe you're not seeing things her way and she was genuinely concerned for you and your partners well-being when the phone died and she couldn't contact you?

That is a serious and reasonable fear for her safety", "that was my thought. 5 cop cars is not the response for a wellness chk. it's potential hostage situation and mom could be on the hook for making a false police report.", "Agreed. 5 cruisers and hanging around for an hour trying to gain entry is not for a wellness check. They\u2019d send 1 maybe 2 and once they see you\u2019re ok and not in distress they would leave", "You're right, I wish it was that simple, but it's hard. My dad \\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* himself like 3 years after I was born. Even though I never knew him, she used to threaten suicide constantly when I was a kid. It's a whole big messy thing but since moving out at 17 and going low contact she's gotten way better and doesn't cross that specific boundary anymore. But I still hear her words in my head every time I remember how long it's been since we last spoke", "You're right, I have put up with it for too long. Thank you", "Thank you for the blunt honesty, I'm internalizing it", "Thank you, you're right", "Just because someone is an addict does not mean they are violent or even potentially violent and that\u2019s a huge jump in logic unless they have a history of violence lol", "Admittedly, it has been a relief not having to deal with her constant problems. But that feeling is followed by a lot of guilt. My dad died of suicide after I was born. When I was a kid she would talk about killing herself anytime she was upset. Luckily, she hasn't done that in years, and I don't even know if I ever even believe it as a kid, but I still hear her words in my head when I remember how long it's been", "She could have called the partner first. Nah. This was malicious. OP should ask for the 911 call, see what mom really said.", "The boundary is exactly that - taking accountability. Prior to this incident I used to put up with her never uttering the word \u201csorry\u201d, but at the bare minimum I needed her to acknowledge reality and my feelings, even if she disagrees. It was only after she didn\u2019t that I asked her to even say sorry. \n\nThe character limit restricted me from fully getting into it, but after the cops left and I called and told her how scary it was and asked her to explain herself (and asked her to promise to never do it again) she started to claim she never called in a wellness check and that she had only called them to \u201cask for advice\u201d. When I asked how her \u201casking for advice\u201d ended in her giving out my name, phone number, and address she tried to claim that they asked her and that the only reason she told them was because \u201cshe\u2019s not going to lie to the police if they ask her a question\u201d. She tried to turn it around on the cops, but they were clear to me that she had filed a complaint. \n\nHer story continued to devolve and change with every word, she got angry and then she turned it around and said I was making it up and saying I was \u201ctrying to make her feel bad\u201d by exaggerating the entire experience and started ranting about my \u201cirrational\u201d feelings about the police. Kept repeatedly saying \u201cshe was only trying to help\u201d, but never actually said she was concerned about my safety. \n\nTowards the end of the call before she hung up she even said I was lying about feeling scared, claimed I was lying about the amount of cop cars. I was bewildered by her and still shaken up and I kind of snapped. I told her that if she couldn\u2019t apologize and acknowledge what she did was wrong, that I couldn\u2019t trust her anymore. She cursed at me and hung up", "I\u2019m well aware this has turned into a \u201cor else\u201d situation, hence why I feel guilty enough to post here and ask. This isn\u2019t normally how I\u2019d react but, after reading these comments, I\u2019m going to consider going NC no matter what. \n\nAlso - it was 11AM on a Saturday \ud83d\ude43 Great way to meet the rest of the neighbours", "Not even when he used to drink heavily. He is actually really gentle and that is one of the things she has criticized about him (Not \"manly enough\" or whatever)", "The mother was 'unsupportive and disengaged' the entire conversation so she obviously wasn't worried for her daughter. Also alcoholic =/= violent. Mom overreacted massively.", "No where did op state that her alcoholic husband is a violent drunk. \n\nPlus if the mom truly cared then she would have been engaged in the conversation", "Are you a dumbass asking random people if they\u2019re a bot? I\u2019m gonna guess the answer is yes.", "Are you a bot?", "Especially if you're in Canada, there's no way five cruisers showed up for a wellness check. My FIL is ex-RCMP and that's absolutely NOT standard.", "If you find out that she lied in the 911 call, definitely make sure that she gets in trouble for making a false report.", "Five police cruisers spending an hour at your house will not make you popular or trusted in your new neighborhood.", "It wasn't a dispatcher, it was one of the cops who ended up showing up. He started the call by asking \"Is this \\[my legal name\\], at \\[address\\]?\" and when I confirmed he told me he was a cop and that they were on their way. I told him I was OK and that there were no problems but he told me they couldn't take me at my word and would have to still come and do the check because \"someone\" outside of the home had called them. At the time on the phone, it sounded like just him and his partner would come and do a quick check, so I was annoyed but not too worried. But then it was 5 cars and about 8-9 cops, which frightened the hell out of me before they even got out of their cars", "I'm just chiming in to also recommend that book.  My mother is awful in her own special ways and it really, really helped me cope with the fact that there was nothing I could have done to make her be better.  Some broken people just can't recognize their own dysfunction.", "That's manipulative af! Talk to a professional and not your mother.", ">Admittedly, it has been a relief not having to deal with her constant problems. But that feeling is followed by a lot of guilt.\n\nI totally get this. The average person is generally empathetic so we regret it when we know someone is suffering (especially someone we know personally) and we think there's something we could do to mitigate that suffering. These feelings remain even when we have a well-founded understanding that the person (or elements of our relationship with that person) are toxic.\n\nMy motto is instances like this is \"Take care of yourself first, so you're then able to help take care of others.\" Even then, the other person must be a constructive partner rather than being intent on tearing everything down. If you haven't put yourself on solid ground they'll take you down with them.", "Lots of people suggesting you get a copy of the 911 call and I just feel like I need to chip this in;\n\nOnce you hear it, you can't unhear it. Be prepared to never speak to her again, cuz it's gonna be a hurt that's very hard to heal from. Speaking from experience.", "My grandma called a wellness check on my mom a couple years ago after they got in a fight and my mom followed through on saying she wouldn't be answering the phone for awhile because she needed space. A single cruiser and 2 OPP officers showed up and were surprisingly cool about it.", "Probably a bullshit post.", "NTA then - you likely should have charged your phone and let her know your phone died but thats minimal compared to what she did.", " Info - So, your husband is in recovery. When he was drinking and/or possibly other things, did he have a history of violence? Abuse? Etc?"]}
