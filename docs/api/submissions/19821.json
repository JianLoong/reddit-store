We love our new community, but X has struggled with losing our big friend group and his family from back home. My own family consists of just my Mom, and she has lived far away from me for a few years already so it has been a softer adjustment for me. For context - X is a recovering addict and alcoholic. \r  \n\r  \nAbout a month ago, shortly after moving in and still very stressed from the move, my partner had a lapse in recovery and drank a few beers that a neighbor had left on our porch. Although he didn\u2019t get really drunk, I was worried and concerned that he drank and then tried to hide it from me. He admitted he shouldn\u2019t have drank and said he wanted to do some thinking and went and sat outside in our garden. \r  \n\r  \nI needed to talk to someone, mostly just to vent, so I called my mom. She routinely calls me 3-4 times a week to complain about her co-workers and neighbors so I didn\u2019t think it would be a big deal. The whole time we were talking she was very unsupportive and disengaged (had the TV on) and so when my phone died mid-conversation, I did not rush to call her right back. I plugged in my phone and instead of waiting for it to turn back on, I went outside to talk to X and check on him. \r  \n\r  \nWhen I came back inside (15 minutes later) my phone was ringing off the hook and when I answered, it was a police officer asking me to confirm my name and address. The cop informed me that officers were on their way to me as someone had called in a \u2018Wellness Check\u2019. I immediately called my mom and she proudly admitted to calling them. Myself and X have always been pretty vocal about our distrust of police back home. Although my Mom does not agree with this opinion, she is VERY aware of it. \r  \n\r  \nFive cop cruisers showed up on our lawn - they questioned us both and repeatedly tried to force their way into our home. They ended up leaving after about an hour but their presence was very intimidating and uncomfortable for both myself and X. \r  \n\r  \nWhen the police finally left and we cooled off, I called my Mom to demand an explanation. She claimed that \u201changing up on her'' was suspicious but when I pushed back on that excuse (not charging my phone has been a lifelong bad habit of mine) she got angry and said it was my own fault, among other nasty things. When I told her the experience was scary for us she accused me of being dramatic and laughed at me. \r  \n\r  \nI didn\u2019t want to fight with her and flat out said that if she couldn\u2019t apologize for calling the police unnecessarily that I would no longer be speaking to her as I don\u2019t trust her anymore. She hung up on me and I haven\u2019t heard from her since. \r  \n\r  \nAITA for enforcing this boundary? My mom has never apologized in her life and I knew that when I insisted on an apology. I\u2019m still upset with her, but as the weeks pass by I'm feeling more and more guilty as she has no friends and I am her only family she can talk to.", "created_utc": 1686922377, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14awzth/aita_for_establishing_a_boundary_that_i_knew_my/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Five police cruisers isn't what they send for a wellness check- she swatted you. 911 calls are public record - request a copy and I think you'll be more confident going no contact.\n\nAnd make sure you're in Al-Anon. You should be calling someone from your Al-Anon group not your mom when your partner relapsed.", "NTA. What she did was a gross over-reaction which escalated an already strained situation into something which, frankly, could have seen serious consequences. \n\n>My mom has never apologized in her life\n>she has no friends\n\nI expect those two statements are  very closely connected.", "Info - So, your husband is in recovery. When he was drinking and/or possibly other things, did he have a history of violence? Abuse? Etc? \n\nIt seems to be a reach for your mother to call the cops but, is there a reason she would be immediately concerned for your safety?", "NTA - Hold the line. Your mother had a number of options before calling the police including calling X. It sounds like her life is so boring that she got a kick out of causing drama. It\u2019s not your job to be her emotional punching bag. Instead of calling her call a therapist.", "NTA and I am so sorry that this happened to you. Wellness checks don't always end well, I'm glad you and X are okay. Like sure, you could have shot her a text saying your phone died would have been polite, but that alone doesn't warrant a call to the cops. \n\nIf you're at all struggling to figure out your relationship dynamics with your mom, my very unsolicited advice as a stranger on the internet is to pick up a copy of Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Children by Lindsay Gibson. It sounds like she fits the bill (particularly the part where you said she will call you to vent multiple times a week but can't provide emotional support or apologize to you).", "NTA...Your mother's behaviour was outrageously inappropriate. You never expressed being in any danger.  She's now put a wedge in the trust and closeness you had. An apology is very little to demand.  I hope your partner finds a comfortable path in your new community.", "NTA. She did something petty that ended up with five cop cruisers on your lawn. That is *serious*. And if she's never apologised for anything in her life it's time she started.", "NTA I can understand as a parent why your mom would call 911 after you told her your addict partner had a relapse weather or not you not charging your phone is a habit. I\u2019m not fond of the police either but if I felt my daughter was in danger I\u2019d call the army if it meant I could make sure she was safe. Context is key and that\u2019s a pretty serious context. Your mom is the asshole though because she didn\u2019t apologize afterwards. If this was me I would have apologized and maybe made a joke out of how I overreacted. Also I wouldn\u2019t cut my daughter off either. So NTA", "NTA\n\nIt's unreasonable that she just chose to go nuclear by jumping straight to a police wellness check. I'm pretty sure she wouldn't appreciate that if you did it to her every time she vented about her coworkers or neighbours.", "Nta. Sounds like you should've cut her off years ago. This can't be new behavior. I'm sorry about your family", "NTA, you are not responsible for your mom's emotional or social well-being. From the way she reacted, it sounds like her choice to call the cops was malicious. There were so many other things she could have done to check up on you.", "INFO Couldn\u2019t it be that your mother was sincerely worried? You just told her that your husband, who\u2019s an alcoholic and drugs addict, relapsed. You called because you were worried about this and then all of a sudden couldn\u2019t be reached. Calling the police was a bit much, but are you sure this wasn\u2019t a sincere reaction based on what she knows about your partner?", "NTA. Her calling the cops may not have been an ass move, it could have been genuine worry. But here are the things that make me think she\u2019s the asshole:\n\nShe was nasty to you, had no empathy or sympathy for how scary a borderline police interrogation can be. She especially had no forethought or empathy for how the cops treat recovering addicts; cops are always suspicious of addicts, recovering or not, and tend to treat them poorly. She assumed your partner was a danger to you, likely told the cops he was a danger to you, and that could have gotten him arrested.", "hmm idk man i mean you called your mom to tell her your partner in recovery was drinking again then suddenly the call ended...I can see absolutely why she would be worried about you. You should have at least texted her and said your phone died but you wanted to check on X before getting back on the call or something \n\nat least light YTA", "You're living with a recovering addict/alcoholic, who went back to drinking under stress in a new place.  You called to vent about it to your mother, then the phone went dead and you didn't call or text back.\n\nHer reaction to call the cops seems a bit much as written here, but I'm betting there is more \"history\" with your partner that you're not offering up in your post.", "NTA. This is outrageous.", "NTA - your mom went scorched earth over a call where you were discussing your SO's behavior \\[something I recommend you don't do with anyone other than a licensed professional in the future\\] and your phone died.  She was disinterested in the conversation until your phone died and then she calls the police for a wellness check?  If you were having a normal conversation with her albeit with some normal venting, your mom was wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy out of line.", "*Your partner is a recovering alcoholic that drank out of a lapse, you called your mother worried, figured she wasn't paying attention because the TV was on in the background, your phone died mid conversation you didn't really care until you found out she called the cops concerned for your well being*\n\nNo wonder she's upset that you told her off after expressing that you're worried. At the very least you know she was paying attention and cares about you. The only thing that was rude of her was laughing after you told her it was scary for both you and your partner.", "NTA. I certainly hope you never speak to her again.", "YTA. If my daughter called to tell me her addict spouse had relapsed and suddenly the phone died and then she wouldn't answer, I would call the police too.

You were telling your mom about a recovering addict who hadn\u2019t relapsed for awhile  was currently drinking/drunk when the call abruptly ended. It\u2019s easy to think the worst in that scenario.

He is actually really gentle and that is one of the things she has criticized about him (Not \"manly enough\" or whatever)", "Thank you, that is a great point that I hadn't thought of.

I didn't have enough characters to get into it in this post, and I wasn't sure I even wanted to mention it, but my Mom has untreated mental illness. That book has been recommended to me before but this time I'm going to actually order a copy and read it", "Thank you for this perspective as a parent, your comment actually made me cry. Even though the cops were scary to deal with, now that so much time has passed the thing that hurts the most is how she reacted afterwards, and since then. I haven't heard from her at all and I noticed earlier this week that she unfriended me on LinkedIn, which is the only social media we both have.", "I genuinely do not believe she thought there was danger. He is a gentle person, sober or drunk. She knew he wasn't even in the house while we were talking (it's a pretty small house) and I was calling from my cell phone. Even if he was violet (which he's not) - it's not like he could have come into the house, ran up the stairs, grabbed my phone out of my hands and hung it up mid-sentence without her hearing a commotion.", "I heavily suspect she lied and said he was a danger to me because the cops repeatedly asked us if we had weapons in the house and didn't seem to believe us when we said no. They kept saying things like \"Only criminals with something to hide don't invite police into their house\" to try and get me to invite them inside. The whole interaction was scary and kind of a blur, but they made us feel like criminals even though we were cooperating.", "No additional history, he was sober for a long time until this situation and is back in recovery now. Never violent to me, or anyone, if that is what you're implying", "You're absolutely right, I shouldn't have spoken to her about it. She has been pretty negative about any partner I've ever had.

I told her the experience was scary for us and asked her to apologize", "I'll accept you judgement. But I have to ask - what is the assumption from a call being dropped mid-sentence?

I'll go ESH, Everybody Sucks Here. \n\nYou're an asshole for not even texting \"phone died, I'll call back later\" after you plugged it in. You vented about a concerning situation then cut off the call, that's legitimately worrying for a parent.", ">flat out said that if she couldn\u2019t apologize for calling the police unnecessarily that I would no longer be speaking to her as I don\u2019t trust her anymore.\n\nOh no, I compelty read the post, which is why this indeed is telling her off. This is like me walking into a pizza restaurant, not liking my pizza and demanding they refund me as an apology or I'm not removing a bad review. You saying you're not longer speaking to her unless she gives an apology is telling her off. If you don't see it as such so be it. You didn't ask, you told her to apologize.", "Yeah, I see now how that could be worrying to her. I guess the part I'm struggling with is that I don't really believe she was concerned for my safety. And if she was truly concerned about me than why has she not talked to me for 4 weeks + now?", "I asked for an apology and she refused to give it. Communicating that this has shaken my trust in her does not mean I have \"told her off\". Where I'm from that language implies screaming and cursing at someone, which I did not do.   \n\n\nI establishing a boundary (to ensure these Wellness Checks don't become a regular occurrence every time she can't reach me) and offered a path to repair the relationship because I genuinely can't trust her anymore. I wrongly assumed a relationship with me was important enough to her to see things from my perspective", "Therefore I judged ESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nMaybe she also feels you purposely didn't text/call after the hang-up to teach her a lesson?", "I didn't leave a judgement because you mother laughed at you when you, as you are saying, \"Asked for an apology\" and said it was a disturbing experience for you and your partner (which for anybody it would be respectfully). You stated you \"Flat out said if she couldn't apologize you wouldn't be talking to her again\". In my experiences, that's telling someone off. It's a one sided mind thinking she can't see things your way and not speaking to her again until she does. It's a double edged sword; maybe you're not seeing things her way and she was genuinely concerned for you and your partners well-being when the phone died and she couldn't contact you? Regardless of that, you're clarifying you asked and not told her that you want an apology. If this is indeed true, YWNBTA as it's a simple case of misunderstanding and she went a little overboard especially with laughing at you when you're understandably shaken up."]}
