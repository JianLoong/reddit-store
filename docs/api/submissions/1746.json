I had gained weight due to this medical condition and also medication and none of my old clothes were fitting anymore. I bought new fitting clothes but for my husband's birthday party, he asked me to wear one of my old dresses that was one of his favorites. To appease him I said yes although I didn't feel comfortable wearing it especially after the weight gain.\n\n\nHe was at the restaurant with his family and friends when I arrived with my sister. As soon as he saw me walking in, he busted out laughing....he pointed at the dress and was going hysterical saying \"oh my God\" I felt so incredibly mad. Especially when the others started laughing as well. One of his friends started whistling in a mocking tone. I turned around instantly and walked out and my sister followed me. I went home and cried a little but he kept calling non stop.\n\n\nHe came home and started talking about how oversensitive I was and that \"it was just a natural reaction\" he had upon seeing me in this dress again after all this time. He said I overreacted and made a scene over nothing. He also said I ruined his birthay and urged me to get therapy for this oversensitivity that I'm inflicting upon him.\n\n\n\nAITA? Did I overreact? He's so upset he refused to even recieve the gift.\n\nEdit! I need to explain the way he laughed more. He first started giggling and tried to cover his mouth then, in a matter of seconds he bursted out laughing. In the middle of the restaurant. The guests were confused then they must've understood why he was laughing because they joined in and his friend whistled at me mockingly while repeatedly turning his head like something caught his \"attention\". Could it be the I overreacted? It could be just me getting overwhelmed because joking and laughing is not new when it comes to him. He's the kind to tease about any and everything even with family. The kids also.\n\nHe also said he was \"caught off guard\" and so I shouldn't blame him for his reaction.", "created_utc": 1667863862, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yp4muc/aita_for_walking_out_of_my_husbands_birthday/", "score": 8799, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

OP, you're NTA.", "He pushed you to wear the dress even though you didn\u2019t want to. \n\nHe made fun of you when you wore said dress. \n\nHe stood by as you were publicly humiliated.\n\nHe didn\u2019t follow you when you walked out and belittled your feelings.\n\nHe told you to go to therapy - not so that you\u2019re happier but so you can stop annoying him. \n\n\nHe tears you down physically and emotionally. He denies any wrongdoing and blames only you. Why are you with him? NTA.", " NTA \n\nYou need therapy, that\u2019s right, but not for your overs sensitivity\u2026but for your own sake/ self esteem/ emotional trauma your husband is subjecting you to. \n\nHis reaction was completely unjustified. This was bound to happen. He guilted you into wearing something you weren\u2019t comfortable in/ he knew you didn\u2019t fit. \n\nHe publicly humiliated you.\n\nHe is blaming you. Gaslighting you. Hasn\u2019t apologised. \n\nGet a divorce pronto, easiest way to drop dead weight.", "NTA!!!\n\nHe never should have asked you to wear something you weren\u2019t comfortable wearing. Then he laughed at you in front of a group of people. It upset you so much you left and cried and he still doesn\u2019t think he did anything wrong. WTF?!?!?\n\nI think you need to reconsider the whole marriage. \n\nIs it possible he asked you to wear the dress specifically to laugh at you?", "Oh girl, oh no. \n\nNTA. \n\nBut he is. What kinda husband treats his wife like this!? What kind of man is he? Im pretty sure if you didn\u2019t know- he just showed you. \n\nHe then turns it around on you and blames you?", "NTA don\u2019t let him gaslight you. This wasn\u2019t appropriate for him to do. His actions put you in a negative spotlight and he then allowed others to mock you. He shouldn\u2019t have laughed and he should have shut down anyone that did. \n\nDon\u2019t be uncomfortable for the sake of other people. Don\u2019t just \u201cwear the dress\u201d next time. No is a complete statement.", "NTA and my jaw dropped. I legitimately cannot imagine my husband even thinking of doing that. I can't imagine my 12 year old thinking that's appropriate behavior. Is this an isolated incident, or is this how he behaves?\n\nWhat is the point of being married to someone who thinks publicly humiliating you is a totally cool and normal thing to do? This whole incident just feels like a \"tip of the iceberg\" thing - he'd have to be so selfish, cruel, and childish to do this. And then to attack you for it? AAAAH\n\nAre there any upsides to being with this guy?\n\nEdited to add: maybe you SHOULD go to therapy to do some deep thinking on how you deserve a partner who loves and respects you.", "Honey, I would talk to a professional, but about your husband. That man is a huge \"red flag\" \ud83d\udea9\nNTA, the important thing is that you are better and healthier than when you were sick, And if your husband can't fell happy for you, for your health, and only cares about your appearance, then I'm sorry to tell you that he's not a good man.", "NTA. Next time he tries to initiate sex and he takes off his clothes, laugh at his dick.", "NTA. That was a dirty rotten thing he did. Even if he didn\u2019t mean to play a trick on you by telling you to wear the dress (and I\u2019m not totally convinced he didn\u2019t do that on purpose), he should not have just burst out laughing at you, gotten everyone else to do the same, and then scolded you for being upset about it.\n\nMaybe you should pack your things and stay with your sister for a while, until he comes to his senses and apologizes to you.", "I am proud of you for walking out when you were treated that way. What was done to you is reprehensible. He can either go to marriage counseling or you can think about whether or not you want to continue being in an abusive relationship. Because that\u2019s what you\u2019re in. NTA.", "NTA.   Hope he doesn't overreact when you serve this AH with divorce papers.", "NTA - please don't subject yourself to this.  A \"husband\" doesn't subject his wife to ridicule and encourage his friends to join in.", "NTA. Your husband set you up to be bullied by him and his family and friends. Over your weight. That's not a man who should ever have the privilege of touching you again. Return his gift and keep the money. The only thing he deserves from you are divorce papers.", "NTA. Oh honey this broke my heart. The fact you even had to justify your weight gain is so sad to me. This is your husband, the person who is supposed to love and uplift you through everything. Even if he was trying not to laugh, he was so so incredibly cruel. He\u2019s lucky I wasn\u2019t also dining at the restaurant because I\u2019d have given him an earful even as a stranger. And then the AUDACITY of that man to tell you that you need therapy for being \u201cover-sensitive.\u201d You are not overly sensitive. I don\u2019t typically tell people to throw the whole man away because marriage is complicated, but this man does not behave like he loves you. A good husband in this scenario would, if anything, feel bad that he asked you to wear something uncomfortable and put you in this situation and would do whatever it took to help you feel confident at dinner. An \u201cEhh\u201d husband still laughs but immediately apologizes and follows you out of the restaurant and makes an effort to be more sensitive to things you\u2019re self-conscious about. A bad husband does what yours did but apologizes with an eyeroll at the end of the evening. Your husband is a few notches below that. I hope you DO get some therapy, but I want to see you work on your self esteem, holding boundaries, and to see how wonderful you are and know that you deserve good things and people who treat you well \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA\n\nHE overreacted and owes you a HUGE apology", "Jesus. Fuck this guy. Leave asap. NTA", "NTA. \n\nMan what is wrong with a lot of these spouses in these stories. He knows of your condition and that you bought New clothes. HE asked you to wear that dress even though you were uncomfortable in it and then he laughed at you? What an asshole. If his \"natural reaction\" is to laugh at his wife then my natural reaction to that would be to give him the Finger my god.\n\nOP dont worry about your weight and if your husband starts talking shit i would recommend rethinking that marriage.", "This is like a Carrie moment. Like a supervillain origin story. I would emerge from this stronger than ever, and damn, I would seek revenge. I\u2019m so sorry OP. What he did was horrible and cruel. NTA. Walking away was a totally badass move on your part. Imagine staying. Hell no. Now plot your next move.", "NTA. Like, is he oblivious to the weight gain? Did he think it was going to magically fit and be flattering? This is just bizarre, honestly.", "NTA you deserve better than being married to an asshole.", "NTA and your husband is emotionally abusing you.", "Why are you trying to give a gift to someone who publicly mocked  you? He thinks you're being overly sensitive because he pointed and laughed about your size. I'd return the favor... while he's naked. He shouldn't be so sensitive. NTA", "NTA but your husband and the other people who laughed sure are. A group of grown ass people pointing and laughing at someone they\u2019re supposed to love and support and then calling them over sensitive for not wanting to endure ridicule is embarassing. I hope you\u2019re doing okay, OP, and I hope your husband decides to grow up soon.", "[removed]", "Honey I think he set you up. \n\nThis sounds like a cruel way to humiliate you. He had to have known how it would fit. \n\nThis is not what a partner does. That\u2019s absolutely heartbreaking op. I\u2019m so sorry. \n\nI would seriously evaluate my relationship if this happened to me, and I don\u2019t think I would be able to be in the same home as my partner while I considered. \n\nNTA at all. Not at all.", "NTA. What an absolutely dreadful way to treat someone. Then he made it worse and tried to put the blame on you. He is a complete AH.", "NTA. What he did was cruel.", "NTA. Tell him you'll be just fine wiping your sensitive tears away with the divorce papers you're about to file to get away from him. What an AH.", "NTA if his \u2018natural reaction\u2019 is to laugh/mock you then he sucks.  Chuck his present in the bin", "NTA!!  This is straight-up bullying, and even worse when it's coming from someone who is supposed to care about you.  To try and turn it around on you for ruining his night, is the definition of gaslighting.  Stand up for yourself.", "NTA. So you\u2019ve put on some weight and are insecure about the changes to your body. Your husband, who knows this, asked you to wear a dress he knew you were uncomfortable in. When he saw you in the dress, he loudly laughed AT you, until his friends joined in by also mocking you. \n\nYour husband and his friends are AHs, and he is abusive. You deserve better.", "When he came home, he should have tripped over the bag you packed for him", "There are things marriages shouldn\u2019t surviv. Ritual humiliation is one. You husband is an AH and deserves to be told to GTFO", "Nta. Unacceptable from anyone you deserve better", "Damn I hate to do this, but you need to reconsider your relationship, this is by no means acceptable behavior! To hurt someone who is just coming off a medical treatment in front of people than to gaslight you and make it your fault! I mean where is the joke what is funny here? He is a jerk!", "NTA\u2014your husband owes you a huge apology.  Embarrassing you in front on an entire restaurant and his cretin friends joining in was a horrible betrayal on his/their part!", "NTA, in any way and stay strong. Do not let him convince you this is somehow your fault, that\u2019s gaslighting. \n\nThis story broke my heart for you. No one deserves to be treated like this, especially not by their spouse. He should be encouraging and on your side, not making you the brunt of a joke. \n\nAgain, NTA, and I\u2019m sorry this happened to you. He\u2019s cruel.", "NTA, what a colossal *asshole*", "NTA\n\nIt's a good thing his birthday got ruined. People who laugh AT their partners instead of WITH their partners deserve to get their birthdays ruined. He's throwing a issy fit because he knows he's in the wrong. \n\nPeople can be teasing, but from the moment that clearly hurts someone they should cut it out and apologize. Especially partners who like and are supportive of their partner.\n\nTake the gift back and buy a nice dress for yourself, that fits your current body and makes you feel beautiful and confident. Everyone deserves to feel like that.", "NTA. He's gaslighting you. He behaved horribly, and is blaming YOU for feeling hurt over his atrocious behavior. You don't treat someone you love that way! \n\n\"Could it be the I overreacted? It could be just me getting overwhelmed because joking and laughing is not new when it comes to him. He's the kind to tease about any and everything even with family.\"\n\nTranslation: He's a bully, and so is his family. How would he feel if you pointed and laughed at his \"shrinkage\" the next time he was cold?\n\nHonestly, I think you should leave. You deserve to be treated better.", "You are NTA.  Your husband however is a massive AH.   So is everyone else in the room who laughed along with him.  They humiliated you.  He may even have set you up when he asked you to wear a dress that you didn't fit into so well anymore.   You didn't overreact.   He owes you a HUGE apology and some serious retribution too.", "NTA - he set you up to be the punchline of his 'joke'\n\nHow can he be 'caught off guard' when 1) he lives with you and 2) he *chose the dress*\n\nHe's not sorry, he's just sorry you refused to be his unwilling sidekick in cruel 'humour'\n\nps 'oversensitive' is a buzzword often used by abusive bullies, fyi", "NTA. He knew you were feeling insecure over weight gain due to a \\*medical issue,\\* and to me, it sounds like he told you to wear that dress on purpose so they could all laugh at you. Even if that wasn't his intention, the fact that he and everyone else were just...mocking you? And then he went to try and blame YOU for being upset at being a literal punchline for their amusement? Why are you with someone who disrespects you like that?", "NTA! You deserve better than a husband who is disrespectful and a massive ass. No one should bully and belittle anyone like that. And on top of that, he blamed you for being over-sensitive? He might be gas lighting you. I wonder whether this behaviour is normal for him? If yes, girl, you need some help.", "NTA what he did was incredibly cruel. And he should\u2019ve told his friend to fuck off.", "NTA.  He behaved abominably.  I can't imagine ever  laughing at my spouse for their outfit in public,  much less one I insisted they wear.  \nYou deserve better.  If you do pursue therapy,  I suggest you explore how your self-esteem has become so degraded and focus on building your confidence.  You may find that the problem is external", "NTA so your husband told you to wear something then was caught off guard by it?   And then spent the evening fuming after you very reasonably left after getting laughed at rather than run after you asking forgiveness?  \n\nHe\u2019s an asshole.  You\u2019re married to a selfish, bullying asshole.  He should absolutely know there is a valid reason for you to be sensitive about your weight after you\u2019ve been struggling so hard.  He told you to wear the dress he likes for his own selfish reasons.  Then he chose to laugh at you when you made the effort FOR HIM even tho you weren\u2019t comfortable with it.  Then blames you for the result of his decision to laugh at you wearing what he chose, at the restaurant he chose, around the people he chose to have there.", "NTA. You\u2019re so used to his abuse that you don\u2019t even see it.", "What in the actual fuck. Go stay with your sister and just communicate through your lawyer from now on. That is outrageous behavior. It would be unforgivable to me.", "NTA. This is shameful behavior on your husband\u2019s part. I usually try to see if things can be worked out, but I\u2019m not sure he can come back from this one. And everyone there started laughing with him?? WTH is wrong with those people? I\u2019d ditch them all, honestly.", "NTA. He did that on purpose.", " nta...next time he wears something start laughing and say you look like you have a micro penis in those pants .... see if he finds it funny", "NTA you deserve a partner who respects and cherishes you. Fuck this guy.", "NTA at all. Your husband was cruel, and his behaviour was immature. The fact he started blaming you instead of apologizing should give you pause. He fucked up and then tried to gaslight you. Not a great combination in a life partner.", "for his birthday you should give him divorce papers! \n\njust kidding but seriously he's the asshole here along with the guests not you in the slightest.", "My husband met me when I weighed 120lbs he married me and reminded me I was beautiful at 200lbs+ he never mentions my weight or asks me to wear things that make me feel uncomfortable. \n\nNTA \n\nHe needs therapy.", "NTA\n\nAn overreaction would be walking up to him and dumping his drink on him.\n\nI would be absolutely livid and would likely spend some time away from my husband if he did that.", "Ask him which part was funny? He\u2019s a HUGE AH, you are not and you did not overreact.", "NTA\n\nStop making excuses for is BS. He was cruel, he laugh at you in front of a room full of people, and then he gaslight you when he got home. Please do you a favor a dump his ass to the curve. You deserve better. You deserve to be loved at any size.", "Your husband sounds like a jerk", "NTA and your husband then went on the warpath of gaslighting you into thinking you're the problem and not him. It's time to get out of this relationship", "[removed]", "NTA he knows what he did was 100% wrong, he instantly acted like you were the problem. You made the effort to dress nicely in something you felt good in and he choice to laugh at you instead of saying how nice you looked. Absolutely disgraceful what a sad man. He may come from a family that tease People but that does not excuse his actions absolutely not he is a grown adult.", "It doesn't really matter how he laughed. He laughed and it was meant to make you feel less of a person.  He sounds like one if the assholes who when they know they went to far say \"I am just being real\". A real asshole. He sends up a lot of red flags, and you need to worry about you and not what he, or anyone else thinks.\n\nYou are NTA he is.", "NTA, but don't let him continue to treat you like that. Is he always so cruel to you?", "NTA. Nothing wrong with finding humor in any and everything but there's a line. He humiliated you and then gaslighted you instead of admitting his mistake. Especially if he knows how you are feeling about yourself right now.", "NTA he even told you to wear this dress, for what? Him to overstep your boundaries and try to lower your self esteem or something? Literally return the gift and buy yourself something nice", "NTA he gaslighting you with your the problem in this too", "NTA. He is though. Drop a couple hundred pounds and leave him.", "Absolutely NTA. He belittled and mocked you, publicly, and then tried to blame you and make himself the victim. His behavior was out of line, not yours. You only wore the dress because he pressured you into it, despite you telling him you were uncomfortable. Then he makes you the butt of jokes. \n\nDoes he often pressure you to do things you dislike or use you as the punchline to his jokes? Does he often blame you for his own behavior? Because this situation is not normal or healthy in a respectful relationship.", "NTA. This is straight up abuse from your husband. Don't let anyone sugarcoat it, he purposely told you to wear clothing that was too small for the express purpose of humiliating you. He will try to deny it, but he's actively body shaming you for his amusement. You can do better, OP, and you deserve better.", "NTA, he specifically asked you to wear something he knew you wouldn\u2019t fit into due to your medical condition and then humiliated you. Fuck that asshole.", "Wow, he is acting out super defensively because he knows how cruel he was and doesn't want to admit it. I'm sorry this happened to you.\n\n\nNta", "NTA. That is gaslighting. He asked you to do something and you did in good faith. Then he mocked you and has now made this your fault. You are not over sensitive. He needs the therapy.", "Wow. NTA but your husband is. I\u2019m speechless that someone who is supposed to love you would do this to you. I\u2019m so sorry. I can\u2019t imagine this is the first time he\u2019s behaved like this so I hope this is the last time and you leave him.", "NTA\n\nI don't see how you could have done anything else in that situation, to be honest.  The fact that he doesn't get that is a really bad sign for the future of your marriage.  I'd be looking into marital counselling as soon as you can get it.", "NTA, but your husband is one! What he did was mean, absolutely no other way to describe it. Not sure if he is mean all the time and blames it on you or not but I know I could not live with someone that mean!", "NTA - he is the ahole, he mocked you, you were NOT over sensitive, he ruined his own birthday.", "NTA, I\u2019m so sorry OP. Hugs to you.", "ABSOLUTELY NOT THE AHOLE. Your husband just embarrassed/humiliated you and then GASLIT the hell out of you by telling you you needed therapy. OP take heed and understand that you are perfectly imperfect and no man, woman, or dog should ever make you feel less than. You didn\u2019t ruin his party, HE ruined it by disrespecting the one person he is suppose to care for the most. Please don\u2019t let him continue to knock you down. I\u2019ve lived this and it took YEARS to pick up the pieces. Proud of you for walking out!", "Nta- I don't understand what would even be funny. Is he in a teen drama movie? Woman, what is wrong with him?", "NTA!!! He needs his head removed from his ass. Don't settle for this and don't let him get away with saying you're just being sensitive. Sorry he did that to you. I'm sure you looked beautiful. The fact that you made yourself uncomfortable just to please him and he made fun of you, he clearly doesn't know what he has.", "Jesus, your husband sucks. NTA.", "NTA. omg. that is\u2026 so disrespectful and disgusting. your husband is a fucking asshole. that isn\u2019t normal, husbands *are* supposed to be nice and love/respect their wives. public humiliation isn\u2019t high on the list of loving behavior", "NTA\n\nNo offense, but you shouldn't have to ask that question. If standing up to yourself because you were laughed at makes you think you overreacted, you have to examine this relationship more carefully. I mean, he literally bullied you, and to top it off, he's messing with your head.", "NTA that is cruel & repulsive behavior on his part, and then turning around and saying you\u2019re \u201cover sensitive\u201d/ \u201cinflicting your issues on him\u201d is frankly absurd and disgusting. You deserve better than to be belittled by your own husband, who is meant to be your partner. YOU ruined HIS birthday? give me a fucking break\u2026", "NTA I\u2019m so sorry OP.

I'm so sorry.\n\nNot long after my ex and I broke up, I went for dinner at his house with my kids and his girlfriend. He brought up a surgery I had for a very embarrassing problem, and he just... Kept laughing.\n\nHis girlfriend at the time worked in the field relating to my surgery so she understood it shouldn't BE embarrassing and wasn't funny, so both of us just sat there and stared at him.\n\nIn my case, I got to think, Hey at least he's my ex.\n\nThis is open to you at any time, just saying. What a ridiculous man.", "NTA; what the actual f*ck is wrong with the partners on AITA? I have never seen a larger collection of cruel husbands, wives, boyfriends, and girlfriends in my life.

He pushed you into wearing something you weren't comfortable in and then when you did it bc it would make him happy he humiliated you.

I'm sorry but I low key hate your husband and in no way are you an AH here even a little bit", "NTA you deserve better. He was acting like a high school bully. And then pretended like you did something wrong and refused to accept your gift? Have a serious talk with him or maybe a divorce is in order. No one deserves to be treated that way.", "Oh dear, look up DARVO.\n\nNTA, but your husband 100% is.", "NTA but I suppose punching him in the face was out of the question?", "It's sad so many women come on here and ask if they are in the wrong for the way they reacted to their OWN HUSBAND doing something horrific to them. Of course NTA but jfc have some respect for yourself and leave him.", "You wouldn't openly mock a friend in public, especially over something you know they're already sensitive about.

His reaction was wrong not yours", "NTA.

I'M SO F MAD!\nYou deserve so much better, if my partner laughed at me, ESPECIALLY in front of  other people, I would be printing the divorce papers the next day! \nHe disrespected you and encouraged he's friends to do the same over something that you're clearly not comfortable or have control over. On top of that, tried to play the victim putting the blame on you! \n\nHe doesn't deserve you.", "NTA. You need to leave him.", "NTA your husband is. I would have done the same thing I think.

He\u2019s just a bully and owes you a MASSIVE apology.", "NTA. I'm so sorry that this happened to you and that it was done by someone who is supposed to love you and support you.

The next time he pulls his pants down, give him the same treatment.", "NTA\n\nThat is some textbook gaslighting right there.", "As soon as someone calls you \u201cover sensitive\u201d you owe it to yourself to re-examine the relationship.

As soon as he saw me walking in, he busted out laughing....he pointed at the dress and was going hysterical saying \"oh my God\" I felt so incredibly mad. Especially when the others started laughing as well. One of his friends started whistling in a mocking tone. I turned around instantly and walked out and my sister followed me. I went home and cried a little but he kepf calling non stop.\n\n\nHe came home and started talking about how oversensitive I was and that \"it was just a natural reavtion\" he had upon seeing me in this dress again after all this time. He said I overreacted and made a scene over nothing. He also said I ruined his birthay and urged me to get therapy for this oversensitivity that I'm inflicting upon him.\n\n\n\nAITA? Did I overreact?

I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had someone admit they were initially wrong so eloquently and without snark before on Reddit. Thank you kind stranger, take my upvotes!", "I gave you an award because necessary information is good, but free access to necessary information is even better \ud83d\ude01", "No need! This is a really critical point about how abusers operate and I'm glad you corrected me. I leaned something new and important today, thanks to you.", "I agree! And thank you :) In abusive situations, the abused are often financially abused as well so it\u2019s super important to have free access to this kind of information out there for those who are in need. (But obviously, purchase the book to support the author, if you\u2019re able!)", "Haha, first hand experience FTW \ud83d\ude05", "YIKES! I hope all is well now...thats so frightening how abusers operate.", "Aww thank you. It is now, I\u2019ve spent the past several years alone working on establishing boundaries and un-codependent-ifying myself \ud83d\ude02. I can spot the bullshit from a mile away now - no more rose colored glasses for me!", "My ex used to say this to me which usually led to him pushing me into something or holding my arms so tight I bruised.  \n\nNTA. He is an asshole.", "It's not gaslighting, it's just cruel.", "He's a sadist, he wanted this. He manufactured this whole scenario because he wanted this to happen. NTA.", "Before I even finished reading this post my husband said this! As soon as I got to the part about him \u201crequesting\u201d aka demanding it he said \u201cWhy would he make her wear a dress he knows doesn\u2019t fit right now? And he absolutely knows why his wife got a new wardrobe.\u201d Then when I got to the laughing part he said \u201cYup. He did it on purpose for some reason. If he really loved her he wouldn\u2019t have done that. Honestly he should only care that she feels comfortable and beautiful in whatever SHE wants to wear.\u201d\n\n2 votes for NTA but husband is a huge, cruel AH that doesn\u2019t deserve you or any other person in the world.", "NTA I've a feeling he's done a lot of other awful things to OP that she's not quite admitting to herself yet.", "THIS RIGHT HERE. AND on top of that he enjoyed the fact that everyone else was laughing at you AND one of his friends was whistling?! WTF. Like I honestly get the impression that this man doesn't respect you at all, considering his reaction over your deep hurt and embarrassment (caused by him!) was that you were oversensitive, that you need therapy for that, AND that you had the audacity to ruin his birthday celebration. Yeah, he's piece of work. SMH. NTA", "I want to stand up in my lounge room and applaud you for this comment. So spot-on and clear. I noticed the way she felt she had to justify putting on some weight and wondered if that's a habit her husband has pushed her into by making her always justify the way she currently looks. \n\nPoor OP, I feel so sad seeing posts like this where it's so obvious to everyone that she's being mistreated but she's so used to it she can't fully see it. She feels it though, or she wouldn't have made the post. Hopefully that's a step she's taken that leads her out of this crappy situation.", "He wouldn't be the same man you married if he behaved this way."]}
