The issue was 3 weeks ago.  You reported it to her, and you reimbursed her for the lost key (by watching her dogs for free).\n\nThis is 100% on her now;  not you.", "\"Am I morally in the hook for reimbursing her for the car?\"\n\nNAH  That's what insurance is for.  Further, she should have taken it to get re-keyed/programmed day 1.", "Eh I mean, you can't be sure that the car was stolen because you lost the keys (unless the keychain was engraved with the car's license plate or something), so I don't think you should be responsible for paying back the car itself, and your friend doesn't seem to have asked that of you so I wouldn't worry too much.\n\nNTA", "> My reasoning for possibly not being at fault is that if she had bought a new key, the old one would not work electronically anymore and the car would have been harder to steal.\n\nSorry to say this part is incorrect. Keys are coded to the car, not the other way around. \n\nThis means that if you make a new key for the car, it doesn't prevent the old keys from working, it simply adds a new one. \n\nIt's more complex than a door key, because cars have immobilisers and smart electronics that help validate that the key is genuine, but creating a new key doesn't prevent the old keys from working. \n\nIt is a huge job to replace the locks and ignition on a car, as they're all coded to the VIN number, the idea being that if you lose all your keys, your manufacturer could make one that will work with the car regardless. It's much easier to copy an existing key, but you can create a brand new one without them at greater expense. \n\nHowever, as for the rest, you made a reasonable offer to cover the costs of a new key, which they accepted. The car was stolen, and they will need to claim on their insurance.", "NTA - Insurance will pay for it.  Keys get lost.  You paid her back for it.  Not your fault if someone figured a way to steal it that may not even have anything to do with the key.", "NTA. You offered to reimburse her and she\u2019s had three weeks to rekey her car. This is not on you.", "You offered to pay to rekey the car and she refused. We also don\u2019t know for sure the key was used to steal the car. The key could actually be in a storm drain or out to sea by now. NTA", "Going on the information present, YWNBTA. It's a little weird to me that she turned down the offer of a new key in favor of having her dogs watched free for a week, though.", "NTA\n\nYou offered her compensation in the form of a new key and she quested that you compensate her with a free week of dog sitting, you complied.\n\nIt was obvious that, with the key missing, there was a possibility of it getting stolen using the missing key. The fact that she didn't think ahead and request you to compensate her in a way that would protect her from that (i.e. you paying for the locks to be redone on her car) isn't on you.", "NTA  \nYou wouldn't be the asshole for not reimbursing the car. You told her right away, and the first thing she should have done was go to the dealer and get it reprogrammed with a new key. Now, I would have expected you to pay for that, whether with cash or free dog sitting, because you lost the key. But the fact that she didn't get the key changed after 3 weeks takes you off the hook for the car in my book. I'd be curious to see what the insurance company does in this situation. I'm not sure that they can avoid paying just because the key was lost 3 weeks ago. But it does kind of seem like might be found pretty quickly, because it was probably just some kids going for a joyride when they found the key and it happened to open a car nearby.", "NAH. You informed her right away and it's been weeks, she had time to rekey the car. You should have paid for that though.\n\nYou don't owe her for the full car, that's what her insurance is for.", "NTA. Simply finding a key doesn't give someone the right to drive away in the car.   The thief is the AH.", "we could debate the morality for hours. \n\nif i were you, i\u2019d make sure that i\u2019m covered ***legally.*** bc that is what is going to matter.", "She could (and should) have had the keys / locks reprogrammed.

One, you took all the steps you needed to take, including suggesting and offering to re-key the car. Two, this is a hazard people taken when they ask people to housesit/petsit/carsit, what have you. Mostly, you're acting in good faith and you've paid her back for the initial fault already (i.e., you watched the dog's for free like she wanted). I also can't even tell if what you did had anything to do with the car being stolen -- it sounds like she had the car keys electronically replaced? I can't get a sense of the timeline.\n\nReimbursing a car is a lot of money and that's why she has insurance. Let them sort it, one way or the other. Your involvement in this is over unless she can really prove you losing her key is the reason why the car was stolen.", "OP you're trying to justify not being at fault when the situation started with you losing her key. If that didn't happen then her car wouldn't have been stolen. As a friend you should really try to do right by your friend regardless of who is at fault.\n\nYTA", "YTA because YOU lost the damn key.

It depends on the manufacturer. I have a german car. For my brand, when a new key is added or recoded, then all keys to the car need to be recoded. I lost a key, bought a new one.

OP informed the owner right away that the key was lost. At that point, the owner knew that there was a risk of the car being stolen.

IMO, you lost the key and immediately tried to fix the problem. She on the hand didn\u2019t take the issue seriously enough and waited. If she had gotten the key reprogrammed IMMEDIATELY then I doubt this would have happened. I had my car broken into and my purse w/ my extra key in it stolen. I didn\u2019t even park that car at my house that day since I knew that they had my drivers license. I parked it at a friend\u2019s backyard and got the car key reprogrammed and replaced NEXT DAY. Never had a problem with it. Yes it\u2019s okay to feel guilt and you can offer to help pay some of it if the insurance doesn\u2019t pay, but you are not on the hook for the whole thing.
