{"id": 28988, "submission_id": "178red6", "title": "AITA for telling my sister her jealousy over something that happened at my wedding is stupid and pointless and that it\u2019s really not my problem causing her to cry?", "selftext": "Sorry for the long title. This whole situation is unbelievably stupid.\n\nI (40M) recently got married to my girlfriend of 3 years Lexi (36F) but I\u2019ve known her for 12 years and this is a second marriage for both of us. We met through work when we worked for the same company but were both very good friends for many years before we got together. So I knew her when she was married to her ex-husband and she knew me when I was with my ex-wife. She came into the relationship with 2 daughters, Hannah who is now 14 and Daisy who is now 6 and I\u2019ve had the joy of knowing them as the kids of one of my best friends and as my own stepkids. Their father left when Lexi was pregnant with Daisy and nobody has seen or heard from him in 7 years, so he completely abandoned Lexi and the girls. My own marriage broke down a year later in 2017 due to my wife cheating. It was a shitty time all round and Lexi and I relied on each other a lot but our friendship didn\u2019t progress romantically until 2020.\n\nI love both Lexi and the girls very much but I have never tried to force myself as a father to them, since I knew Hannah remembered her bio dad real well and has struggled immensely with his abandonment. It happened naturally when Daisy called me Dad one day and hasn\u2019t called me anything else since. Hannah has also  started referring to me as her dad but still calls me by my first name. \n\nAnyway, at the wedding reception once all the speeches and stuff were out of the way, my mom grabbed me and told me that Lexi and the girls had a surprise for me. Basically, I was pulled away and Hannah and Daisy asked me to officially adopt them. I never expected this and was so over the moon I cried tears of joy so of course I said yes. \n\nWord quickly got out and ever since my sister  Claire has been insanely jealous. She has stepkids of her own and they have a mom very involved in their lives snd they do not view Claire as a mom at all. She has tried to push it and it\u2019s caused bitterness between them. My sister has made some incredibly bitchy comments saying it\u2019s not fair that she\u2019s been involved with her stepkids a lot longer and she is only viewed as their dad\u2019s wife whereas after just \u20183 short years\u2019 I\u2019m already a dad.\n\nI\u2019m honestly sick of her trying to ruin my happiness so I told her her jealousy was both pointless and pathetic and it\u2019s really not my problem at all that her relationship with her stepkids is different than mine and I made her cry.\n\nShe is now saying I\u2019m an insensitive AH as she doesn\u2019t have bio kids and it\u2019s the closest she\u2019ll get even though I don\u2019t have bio kids myself.\nMy mom says she is being childish but some others think I need to show compassion. Personally I think the reason why I have such a great relationship with my girls is because it happened naturally, I have them time and space and I did things with them in mind. I didn\u2019t just expect to be viewed the same as their actual mom, whereas Claire did. I\u2019ve always been well aware of the fact that Hannah spent a very long time missing and yearning for her bio dad and I have always kept that in mind as I\u2019ve always had her and Daisy\u2019s best interests at heart.\n\nETA: Claire is 50 and my BIL is 55. My step-nieces/nephews are 27, 25 and 22. She\u2019s been with my BIL for 15 years and married for 12 so it\u2019s not like the kids were very little when she came into their lives so I don\u2019t get why she\u2019s so pissed off they don\u2019t consider her as a mom. She wanted the mom experience as soon as she was involved with them but they were too old for that I suppose.\n\nShe was also never really interested in kids until she met my BIL but was more concerned with raising his kids equally as hers rather than try for a bio one with him.", "created_utc": 1697410283, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178red6/aita_for_telling_my_sister_her_jealousy_over/", "score": 1296, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Assuming their bio mother is a decent person, that last thing you want to do is to estrange your step kids from them. That would be harmful for everyone. If step mom is a decent person, the kids have plenty of room in their hearts for both. She won't be \"mom\" but there could be a special relationship. I'm sorry for her that this didn't happen", "NTA. \nYour relationship with your stepkids is none of your sisters business and there\u2019s no reason for her to be personalizing your kids\u2019 decision as a reflection on her or about her.

Should you show compassion? Absolutely. That means validating her feelings, empathizing with her, being willing to listen to her within reason, not rubbing it in her face, etc. But if they think it means you should refuse to adopt these two kids because Claire didn\u2019t get that opportunity or to pretend that you aren\u2019t these girls\u2019 dad around her because it hurts her feelings, then sorry, that\u2019s not compassion, that\u2019s enabling.
