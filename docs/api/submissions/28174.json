Be happy for him.", "Nope\u2026 people making you jump through hoops like run to emergency rooms because they ODd don\u2019t get trust. It\u2019s aggravating enough having to put up with their shit. Of course you have cause to doubt him\u2026 he downed so much cough medicine he had to go to the ER. I would however use this moment of sobriety in his life to inform him that he actually needs help and this hiatus doesn\u2019t mean anything unless he gets help to address why he was doing this in the first place. He might stop drinking cough syrup.. but the problem isn\u2019t going away. It will also manifest itself in the form of other addictive or destructive behaviors. Now that he isn\u2019t drinking the cough syrup he can get to the real issues. If he doesn\u2019t get help \u2026 you can\u2019t help him and he\u2019ll just be a dry drunk", "NTA. It\u2019s better to doubt addicts since the vast majority will relapse & it will help *you* to cope better when they do. That being said, you should always be supportive when they do make that effort & it\u2019s best to not let it show that you doubt them. Unless your brother was horribly offended by your comment, I would think it\u2019s probably fine to just let it go & be there for him.", "NTA.  They call it bottoming out for a reason.

He is addicted to DXM, which he consumes by drinking entire bottles of cough syrup around 2 to 3 times per week. I love my brother so much, but at the same time, he's had substance abuse issues for the past 2 years or so, and I am burnt out.\n\n\nAnyway, a bit more than a month ago, my brother had a nasty reaction to the DXM. He called me up, and he weakly asked me to come to his apartment asap because he wanted me there. So I came to his apartment, and he was a mess. He didn't know where he was or who he was, and he kept muttering gibberish. I took him to the ER. While we were waiting at the ER, he told me \"I'm going to become sober, I can't use this stuff ever again\". I just grew exasperated with him, and I coldly said \"yeah, whatever\".\n\n\nIt's been a month since his bad trip. And, to my astonishment, my brother has been sober for the entire month. I can see the effects that sobriety has on him. He's exercising more, and he's so much more relaxed and not-scatterbrained. Also, he's taking his studies more seriously, and he has joined his university's computational physics club, and he's getting along with good role models.\n\n\nAITA for doubting my brother?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The last thing I told my brother before he ODed on heroin was how proud I was that he got clean.\n\nThat being said if your brother really is getting clean and getting his life together I would encourage him. It sounds like he really is making some positive changes. Addiction is such a hard thing to watch someone you love struggle with. I really hope he stays sober.", "An addiction can definitely be something you use only a few times a week", "You\u2019re projecting & you\u2019re wrong.", "WTF?  Are you delusional?", "Well, not really. It would be like calling someone an alcoholic because they get drunk a few times a week, but function just fine the rest of the time and don't have overwhelming cravings for alcohol. By your definition, most college students would be alcoholics.", "I'm not saying that if you do something a few times a week you are addicted to it but you can be addicted to something and only use it a few times a week.", "I am currently in recovery and there was plenty of time I was only using it a few times a week but I was still abusing substances. And addicted to it!", "Do you know someone who wants to think they\u2019re definitely not an alcoholic/addict who binge drinks/gets drunk or get high multiple times a week?  Regularly?  Because yes, that is very often addiction.  There\u2019s stages.  There\u2019s not a clear dividing line between \u201ccan\u2019t enjoy a game without three beers\u201d and \u201cdrinks vodka to get through morning classes and rides a moped because he lost his license to a DUI.\u201d  There\u2019s a lot of stages in the middle.\n\nTell whoever it is they should quit intoxicants for sixty days to give their liver a break to regenerate damage and their digestive system to recover and see how many excuses they come up with about why that\u2019s unnecessary/excessive/an overreaction.\n\nIf somebody just can\u2019t bear to quit using whatever it is they might be addicts/alcoholics.\n\nSober October or January is a thing.

Just because it\u2019s common doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s okay or healthy or sustainable.", "You absolutely can be an alcoholic and only consume it sometimes.    There are many phycological factors that go into being an addict.", "Addiction looks completely different for everyone. You can do drugs every other day and be burned out on the off days and then you would only be using 3-4 times a week but you would definitely be taking a toll on everything in your life living like that and still only using a few times a week"]}
