I wasn\u2019t too thrilled about it, but my wife and I have been as supportive as possible. She still lives at home with us, so we've all had to adapt to a baby in the house. My wife and I have 2 other kids, one of which (Ryan), is 8, and has bad ADHD. He\u2019s very energetic and is always running around the house making noise. We're all used to how he behaves, and nobody ever had a problem with it, until Madison brought a baby into the house.\n\n\r  \nEverything was fine until Madison started complaining to my wife and I that Ryan was repeatedly waking up the baby after she\u2019s finally been settled down to sleep, by making loud noises and barging into her room to look at her and try to wake her up from her sleep to play with her. She'd complained about it a few times and so I told Ryan that he needs to keep in mind that the baby is trying to sleep so he has to keep it down a bit, and he seemed to understand what I was saying. I also reminded Madison that Ryan can\u2019t help how he behaves and that he is naturally loud and full of energy.\n\n\r  \nI heard nothing about it for a while, so I assumed that it was sorted, but I was in the kitchen one afternoon and I heard shouting coming from upstairs, so I went up so see what was wrong. I went up to see Madison angrily shouting at Ryan, who was in tears. I asked her what the hell was going on and she explained that once again, Ryan had barged into her room shouting while the baby is sleeping and as a result had woken her up. I told her I didn\u2019t care what Ryan had done because it was no excuse for making him cry. She obviously didn\u2019t like that I wasn\u2019t on her side, so she started criticising my parenting skills and saying how I need to start disciplining Ryan properly. I snapped back at her and told her that if she doesn\u2019t want to have to deal with Ryan, then she shouldn\u2019t have had a child in my house and if she doesn\u2019t like it, she can get out. She didn't take me saying that very well and stormed off after. She's refusing to apologise and has pretty much been avoiding speaking to me since, which I think is quite petty, but it is what it is.

Regardless of Ryan's ADHD, he is old enough to know not to enter rooms he isn't supposed to and not to try to wake up a sleeping baby! \n\nThis isn't about him being loud and rambunctious. He's not playing in the living room and making noise. He's actively seeking out spaces he's not allowed and doing things he shouldn't. And you are not doing him any favors by allowing this to continue without discipline. \n\nMadison is a 20-year-old new mom. First-time parenthood is stressful for anyone, and you're making her life harder by refusing to effectively parent your younger child. \n\nMy non-expert armchair diagnosis is that you are treating Madison poorly because you're disappointed that she became pregnant and had a baby. If that's the environment you are going to provide her, she would be better off moving out (if that's financially feasible) because she doesn't need to be undermined and judged all the time.", "YTA- you\u2019re letting Ryan run wild and using his ADHD as an excuse. It would be one thing if Ryan was playing loudly in his own room and waking the baby. But he\u2019s barging into Madison\u2019s room over and over and over. An 8 year old can absolutely understand privacy and boundaries. Except he\u2019ll never learn because you\u2019re just making excuse after excuse for his shitty behavior. Clearly you give zero shits about your daughter and grandchild.", "What the fuck do you mean \u201che can\u2019t control how he behaves\u201d?\n\nA medical condition isn\u2019t a free pass to do whatever he wants, or for you to let him.

Which is a reasonable expectation with or without a baby.", "YTA \n\nIf Ryan's ADHD is so bad that he cannot understand not to wake a sleeping baby, he has extremely serious issues. Sounds to me that you are making excuses for his behavior.  Are you providing positive outlets for Ryan's behavior (sports, going outside, medication)? It sounds like you are not. What does Ryan's teacher say about his behavior? \n\nIn terms of her making her brother cry, come on.  He knows better. Its OK to discipline kids. Its OK if they cry every once in a while for a mistake they made, especially if this is an ongoing issue. The worst kids to take care of are those that use their diagnosis as an excuse for their terrible behavior. Its learned from the parents.", "YTA\n\n\nYou are using Ryan\u2019s ADHD to cover up your disappointment of your daughter having a child.

If he doesn't learn to control his behavior and noises now, he's going to get in trouble at school. People in public places like restaurants and stores will be annoyed by his disruptive behavior and you'll be the asshole parents who demands that everyone just tolerate it. Your daughter is struggling to raise her child and you're angry at her for having a baby so young, so you're eager to find a reason to kick her out.

For how long will you be welcome? How will you support the child and yourself? While I believe that you as her parents did the right thing by having her stay at home with you (as I too would likely do in this situation) I do think there is a little bit of \"bite the hand that feeds you\" here. She likely does not pay rent, or bill? I would also assume she gets help from the household with babysitting, or general care with the baby? In which case, she kinda needs to just grin and bear it. She could be in a worse situation (which is not to say she shouldn't complain because others have it worse) but this is the situation, that unfortunately she and the baby daddy created and if living with her brother is too much - regardless of your parenting to him - she should find elsewhere. \n\nUltimately, ESH and N A H.

I wasn\u2019t too thrilled about it, but my wife and I have been as supportive as possible. She still lives at home with us, so we've all had to adapt to a baby in the house. My wife and I have 2 other kids, one of which (Ryan), is 8, and has bad ADHD. He\u2019s very energetic and is always running around the house making noise. We're all used to how he behaves, and nobody ever had a problem with it, until Madison brought a baby into the house.\n\n\r  \nEverything was fine until Madison started complaining to my wife and I that Ryan was repeatedly waking up the baby after she\u2019s finally been settled down to sleep, by making loud noises and barging into her room to look at her and try to wake her up from her sleep to play with her. She'd complained about it a few times and so I told Ryan that he needs to keep in mind that the baby is trying to sleep so he has to keep it down a bit, and he seemed to understand what I was saying. I also reminded Madison that Ryan can\u2019t help how he behaves and that he is naturally loud and full of energy.\n\n\r  \nI heard nothing about it for a while, so I assumed that it was sorted, but I was in the kitchen one afternoon and I heard shouting coming from upstairs, so I went up so see what was wrong. I went up to see Madison angrily shouting at Ryan, who was in tears. I asked her what the hell was going on and she explained that once again, Ryan had barged into her room shouting while the baby is sleeping and as a result had woken her up. I told her I didn\u2019t care what Ryan had done because it was no excuse for making him cry. She obviously didn\u2019t like that I wasn\u2019t on her side, so she started criticising my parenting skills and saying how I need to start disciplining Ryan properly. I snapped back at her and told her that if she doesn\u2019t want to have to deal with Ryan, then she shouldn\u2019t have had a child in my house and if she doesn\u2019t like it, she can get out. She didn't take me saying that very well and stormed off after. She's refusing to apologise and has pretty much been avoiding speaking to me since, which I think is quite petty, but it is what it is.

Ryan has severe ADHD with lots of energy, and Ryan is also showing bad behavior.

Or get her a lock for the door or a sign that says \u201cRyan, no!\u201d?\n\nHaving a baby in the house is difficult, but you had months to know this was coming. You could have helped her move out if you weren\u2019t going to support her. \n\nShe shouldn\u2019t be yelling at Ryan, but you shouldn\u2019t tell her you\u2019ll support her and then not doing that.", "Yta.

You and Ryan both sound like a nightmare. ADHD can be managed appropriately and it sounds like you\u2019re doing jack all to do it.

I have trouble remembering to do something when it is a new \"rule' or routine. I have trouble keeping in mind how important it is to the other person. Having a visual or physical reminder helps with this. A lock would be an accommodation to his adhd to help him remember he's not allowed to barge in. It would also show your daughter that you do care about her feelings and are trying to curb the behavior. ADHD is a reason to ramp up parenting, not give up on it.\nMy 7 year old with ADHD wants to behave correctly, she needs extra help to do that. I can fuss at her to put her shoes on but she's not going to get her brain to cooperate with completing the task. Rather than fuss and fuss and both of us get upset, I literally turn her in the direction of the shoes, wait for her to make eye contact with them, then tell her to put them on. \nWhen her and her siblings are playing a rambunctious game and she's getting too physical, we put boxing gloves on her. This seems counterintuitive but the extra weight and physical sensation makes her more aware of what she is doing and makes her think before she acts. She gets to continue playing instead of time out and she's really proud of herself for behaving and being a good sister.\nMy point is, adhd is not an excuse to do whatever you want and you need to help him realize what he needs to do to help him with his behavior so he can be proud of himself instead of experiencing the wrath and disappointment of the people around him.", "YTA\n\n> barging into her room to look at her and try to wake her up from her sleep to play with her\n\n***HE'S 8!!!*** He's old enough to not do this!!!!  \n\nBe a parent!  \n\n\n> Ryan can\u2019t help how he behaves and that he is naturally loud and full of energy\n\nThis is some really ableist BS.

He doesn't have to because you excuse all of his behaviors on his condition.   Maybe find a therapist in your area to learn how to effectively parent him.

But it happens\u2026 sounds like she had shitty parents so not surprised she ended up pregnant at 19\u2026 probably went looking for validation somewhere else and got pregnant\u2026 cause it\u2019s clear home life revolves around the 8 year old\u2026 it just hurts my heart the validation behind N-t-a is just simply she decided to have a baby\u2026 so that means she deserves shitty treatment from her actual parents", "This is a joke right?", "Super gross.", "ADHD is never an excuse for not understanding there\u2018s a baby sleeping in the house.

But she needs to handle all of her problems and be understanding of the struggles of having a young child with ADHD or she can leave?\n\nHere\u2019s the thing 0P, if she does move out, you are not gonna get to see your grandbaby. Because you basically put it to her that she\u2019s the problem. Because you are unwilling or too lazy to try and set your son up with the basic life skills that he\u2019s going to need to function when he\u2019s older. Having ADHD is not an excuse to not learn. I said it before in a different post, Get him in the physical place. I\u2019m not saying medicated. I have a niece with ADHD and medication was not the best for her. Instead, my sister put her into sport after sport after sport. She would go outside with her and ride bikes and play and run her out. And when my sister started doing that, her grades improved, her ability to focus improved, her ability to interact with other people without frustrating them improved. She became much better at understanding when people would set a boundary with her. I truly recommend you increasing his physical play in a structured manner. It will also help with his behaviors inside the house. Because he is being allowed the opportunity in a structured and acceptable way to let his energy off. In return, you will see an improvement in his ability to follow instructions, and to be more cognizant of the people around him and their needs.", "Sounds like everything would be a lot less stressful if you got your son to behave and actually hold him accountable when he does something wrong.
