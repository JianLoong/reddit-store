Who knows.\n\nI get people saying Y T A because you shouldn't be telling her what to do and what not to do. She is enjoying her life as she should. But I also get being upset that she dances with random men that are then touching her. If she'd be friends with them it would be different, but random people would make me a little upset too.

Say that despite laughing off her previous club experiences of blokes doing these things with her, you actually felt uncomfortable. Explain it is the people with bad intentions behind their actions that you want to prevent. (At least that's the impression I'm getting)\n\nTry to compromise. Offer to go with them. You don't have to spend time within that group throughout the night. Maybe just go and enjoy the music. Ask some friends to join too. This way, you can be near them to keep an eye out if something goes down. Otherwise, they are left to their night out. Out of sight, out of mind.\n\nUltimately, this will not work out for you if your idea is to prevent her from doing what she wants. She is her own person. She can go to the club with her friends if she wants. She knows and accepts what risks are present when out at night, and if she doesn't at 29, I'm worried. It is her decision.\n\nOne thing to note when thinking on this is the age gap. Idc so long as both people know what they are getting into, but that is the key point. You need to know what you are getting into. There is over a decade between you. There will be social and cultural differences as the world is a lot different growing up that much later. It will impact who you are as a person and what you want to do. You have to be aware and accepting of this, otherwise its best to find someone else.\n\nI hope it works out for everyone.", "NTA.

Shall she just stay at home with her BF and ignore her friends now that she's in a relationship? Are you blaming her because men have started dancing with her?

I do disagree with those making a blanket statement about \"creepy older men\", I dont think their age gap is particularly inappropriate but I dont think the age gap is what OP expected.\n\n>Generally speaking women want resources from men and men want sex from women\n\nI think this statement tells me a lot about you. You obviously just want women for sex.\n\n>a better equivalence would be if the man in the post was being DM\u2019d by sex workers on IG and he was buying their content or spending money on them for attention\n\nIts completely different. Buying content from someone is consenual.

Or his occupation?\n\nWhy do men care about a woman\u2019s body count? \n\nSociety gives more power to men? Have you lost your mind? As of 2023 western society caters systematically to women where it doesn\u2019t to men.\n\nMost homeless people are men\nMost people who are victims of violent crime are men\nMost victims of suicide are men\nThe majority of people in Universities are women\nAffirmative action quotas are set up primarily to serve women\nDivorce and family courts are set up to favour women\u2026there are men out there paying child support for children who are knowingly biologically not theirs\u2026how powerful.\n\nMany countries have rape laws which define rape as forced insertion\u2026\n\nMen who want to report a rape or SA are laughed at\u2026\n\nWhere is this power exactly?\n\nIf you are genuinely being harassed or touched in ways that is inappropriate by men\u2026that is a crime punishable with prison time\u2026is this also a symptom of the patriarchy?\n\nAnd anyway, I don\u2019t want to turn this into the oppression olympics\u2026men and women have their own set of challenges on their journeys\n\nWhere are women taught that they must play nice?

I don\u2019t see a single law which benefits men\u2026\n\nAgain, onto the post. If she feels harassed by these men then why not tell her friends so they can help, or security at the nightclub who would deal with it?\n\nI don\u2019t get people like you\u2026on one hand women are equal to men and as capable in all areas (assuming that this is something you prescribe to, tell me if I\u2019m wrong) and then the other hand they\u2019re also damsels in distress who can\u2019t tell a man who is appropriately dancing with or touching her to go away\u2026make it make sense.\n\nI\u2019m slowly removing social media from my life so won\u2019t be doing any further gender reversed posts\u2026I had a point to prove and accomplished that\u2026the differences in the responses were stark.

Again this tells me exactly what your attitude towards woman is.\n\n>It would be interesting to know whether she has offered for OP to go with her\u2026but we don\u2019t know that\n\nShe is going out with her friends. If you can't trust your GF to have a girls night and need to tag along then you are most definitely insecure.\n\n>My point about attention stands\u2026people like positive attention, it makes them feel good. Are you refuting this?\n\nIt definitely makes people feel good but if you dont act on it then whats the problem? Im a straight man, I go to gay clubs with my gay friends and get attention from gay men. Obviously it makes you feel good but its not suddenly going to make you turn gay. Provided you aren't insecure about your sexuality I don't see the harm in having a laugh with the person flirting with you and then letting them know you aren't interested.\n\nSimilarly the attention may make his GF feel good but if she doesn't act on it then whats the harm? If you think that she is going to act on it then you are insecure. If you cant trust her to be out drinking with friends without chaperoning her then you are 100% insecure.\n\n>Notionally, if the scenario was reversed would you still have have the same outlook? A 29 F homebody who was unhappy that her 42 M partner is going to nightclubs and flirting with strange women? Would she be TA?\n\nIf he was the one initiating it then yes he would be an asshole, OPs GF wasn't initiating anything. \n\nId also say the same thing that the relationship is obviously mismatched. \n\n\n>Putting yourself in an environment where you will be grinder on is consensual\u2026it\u2019s what happens in nightclubs\u2026is it right?

A lot of the time its easier for women to nervously go along with it rather than instantly reject someone as drunk men can be persistent and not take no for an answer.\n\nUnfortunately this does happen in nightclubs but it doesn't mean she enjoys it and it shouldn't stop her from having a good night with friends. \n\n>Men and women are different\u2026we don\u2019t need to make this about me and whether my life is moralistic in your eyes\u2026it doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nIt does matter.

If she has men dancing with her id be more worried for her safety rather than accusing her of cheating.\n\nSimilarly I tend to not look at my phone if I'm on a night out with my mates and my GF will always grill me for it.
