While she was in school she gets into this relationship with this guy call him John.Initially she tells us John also went to the same school as her but we later discover that was a lie. And in reality he worked random jobs. In her junior year she ends up getting pregnant by him we beg her to abort the baby. She ends up leaving that semester and we end up helping her raise our grandson. John says he is going to Miami and disappears.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n My daughter moved back in with us and we raised our grandson while she finished her degree online.This whole process we all have gotten close again and we love our grandson. About 1 year and 4 months ago she moved out to her own apartment near by and got a job as well.\n\n  \nShe has been dating and meeting guys on her own now and hasn\u2019t had much luck. She now has been asking me and my wife to introduce her to guys through the Indian community with good jobs that are looking to settle down.\n\n  \nThe fact that she already has a kid and the fact that the kid is half black and the fact she was never married either makes it so much worse. Me asking around just brings more drama to our family and harms our social relationships. Daughter doesn\u2019t see this way she sees it as another form of punishment from us. From what I can tell she doesn\u2019t like the work and effort of being a single parent and thinks her only way of improving her work life balance is finding a man to help split the effort. We have tried to tell her softly that she should stick to Americanized dating as we don\u2019t think she would have a lot of luck.\n\n  \nHowever, she kept pressing us to help her find a guy. The reality is that having children out of wedlock is not part of Indian culture at all, and two the fact that her son is half black will also make it impossible to find a match. She has pressed us to try despite that. But there are two things, 1. Not one person has expressed interest in our daughter, at weddings, prayers no one has approached us to ask us if our daughter was open to meeting their son. 2. I feel that us asking around will make our family look worse if anything and damage our relationships with people in the community.My wife and I have had tense discussions with our daughter, and she views us bad guys.", "created_utc": 1702263961, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18fkrnd/aita_for_not_looking_for_an_arranged_marriage_for/", "score": 996, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

All the asshole votes are from western people who are judging based on western standards or people immediately jumping in the fact that you said the kid was half black. You didn\u2019t say anything about the guys race before it was relevant, so I\u2019m willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. \n\nUnfortunately his race is relevant, the fact that he exists is relevant when you\u2019re thinking about an arranged marriage, that\u2019s what these people aren\u2019t understanding. It doesn\u2019t even really matter that he\u2019s half black, a child out of wedlock (or even a child from a previous marriage) is an immediate dealbreaker for any family looking into an arranged  marriage for their son. I don\u2019t know how your daughter doesn\u2019t understand that. She closed that door when she had the child.\n\nIt\u2019s hard enough to date normally as a single parent with a child in any country. Why on earth would she assume an arranged marriage would be easier?", "NTA all the yt as can fuck right off with no understanding of the Indian community. \n\nYou are trying to protect her\n\nI'm a non traditional as they come with a *gasp* love marraige situation and still understand innately that your daughter, and by her extension, you,  are at best marginally tolerated and at worst,  ostracised and used as an example for young little Indian children like \"look at her alone with a *insert one of the various Indian racist terms for black* child, look at no one wanting her\".\n\nIf you went and tried to get her match made at best you will be ostracised and used to scare little kids with \"look at her alone with racist term baby and how unhappy she is and look at her gall for trying to crawl back into the community and strand one of our lovely men with her racist term baby\"\nAt worst she'll get a match with a literal wife beater who will abuse the shit out of her kid if not force her to leave the child with you as a precondition. \n\nTo everyone my opinion of traditional South East Asian arranged marraige community might sound harsh,  but YOU the Indian know it to be true.  And you need to lay it or for her with those exact same examples. \nIt's hard but she made her bed,  dragged you along with her. She'll have to deal and find someone outside the community or look herself for someone in the wider community who is non traditional", "NTA. As I have quite a few Indian friends, I get how the arranged marriage scene seems to work. Even someone divorced with no kids is a potentially hard match. People have high standards, and want their match to meet those standards. \n\nWhile people are already jumping on you here for pointing out the race of your grandson, I think it is relevant to the struggle to match her. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA for pointing out that others in the community might not want to pursue her for this reason. She is probably much more likely to find a match from Western-style dating. However, do keep an ear and eye open for potential matches for her. You never know who might pop up.", "NTA - It sounds like you are trying to set realistic expectations. The type of men who agree to a traditional arranged marriage are looking for more traditional women. Unfortunately, her untraditional situation does make things harder for her. She would likely have much more success with Western/Americanized dating.\n\nHowever, I do think you need to be a bit more empathetic and reassure her that she can still find love. It just won't be found within a community with such rigid views.", "You are right, a choice has been made. She decided to take the western way. Every action has it's repercussions. She has to accept responsibility for her actions.\n\nIt's going to be almost impossible to find someone in the Indian community who will accept her. Sad state of affairs but it's the way it works and nothing can be done now. \n\nYou can only comfort her.", "NTA. The daughter opted for a \u201cnormal\u201d non traditional to the Indian way of life , had a child out of wedlock. Now suddenly she wants a traditional arranged marriage. Unfortunately her prospects will be low and she needs to look at divorced men with children of her own for that arrangement to work. Else she can try to find love conventionally with regular dating. She can\u2019t go back to traditional after kicking all that away the first time.", "I\u2019m white married for 20+ years to a desi. That was difficult enough. \n\nYour daughter is being hit with a lot of reality about being a single mother. She wasn\u2019t looking to get married when she had parents in the same household.  She needs help and if she thinks an arranged marriage is the answer, she\u2019s barking up the wrong tree. The man may want her, but treat the child poorly. Anything can happen. An arranged marriage may even make her situation harder.  Try to stress to her that while you hope she finds a special husband, that being a single mother is hard and she has your family support. Hopefully as the child grows older, it will be some easier. She thinks she can have it both ways. You can\u2019t just switch from traditional to modern when one gets too hard. \n\nThe process of looking through an arranged marriage is brutal. She\u2019s already at a serious disadvantage for being an unwed woman. She went out of culture with the last man and it\u2019s almost impossible to get her a husband through that pathway, except maybe someone who is similar. \n\nLet her talk directly to a \u2018matchmaker\u2019 and hear for herself. Her biodata will likely be pulled by someone who wants a green card or has some other problem. That\u2019s only going to compound how hard her life is. I agree that she\u2019s probably better off looking on her own. I had 2 SIL who were just divorced from desi men and near 30. There wasn\u2019t much even for them.", "NTA - while it's archaic and as an Indian I hate the practice and culture associated with it, she needs to understand the reality of being a single mother as a marriage prospect in South Asian communities.\n\nHer having a child automatically makes her extremely undesirable in an arranged marriage, unless she's fine marrying some 50+ year old bachelor, who very likely will not treat her well.\n\nIt sucks for her situation, but she's much better off either pursuing men who don't follow that culture or using those Indian dating apps to find a man.", "NTA\n\nHer entire reasoning for wanting an arranged marriage is to have someone take on the extra cost and time of her child. She has to understand that it\u2019s harder to find that in any culture, let alone one where children out of wedlock is taboo. \n\nYou\u2019ve already stepped up in helping her more than you\u2019re obligated to. At some point your adult child has to take care of themselves and I\u2019m saying this as someone outside of your culture. \n\nOn a side note, if she\u2019s struggling financially she should 100% be chasing up her baby daddy for child support payments.", "I have complicated feelings about this post.\n\nI feel sorry for the kid. That\u2019s it. Ultimately, he is the one who will suffer the most. She doesn\u2019t need to marry any person who would look at her son as less than.", "Oof! Desi here, and you're absolutely NTA! Bad idea, reeeeally bad idea if she tries to go the arranged marriage route. **So** bad.\n\n\nThe number of people who think they know better than actual Desi folks how bad the outcome could be is just...umph! \n\n\nListen, not only is any sort of marriage going to be 100 percent a charity case, but depending on what sort of family she marries into, they are going to let her know that every day of her life.\n\n\nAnd that poor kid? That poor kid is going to get ripped to shreds. *Especially* because he's half black.", "The real asshole here is John for getting your daughter pregnant and then leaving her to deal with the consequences of BOTH their actions. The real victim here is that poor kid.", "NTA - your daughter is an adult, a parent, and needs to build her own relationships.  You guys are already supporting her in the ways you should be.  That you are uncomfortable taking on a traditional matchmaking role given that she's made such untraditional life choices is completely reasonable.  \n\n\nAnd please don't take this statement as offering a positive or negative assessment of traditional vs. untraditional life choices.", "NTA. You are more aware of what your community expects from a bride than she is. Everyone calling you a racist is deluded. You love your grandchild and your daughter. She did not respect your culture and now she wants back in. Sometimes that isn't possible.", "NTA. You have supported your daughter and grandchild. She wouldn\u2019t be doing as well as she is now without that support. Instead of gratitude she wants you to do more even though it\u2019s impossible. She sounds like the same stubborn teenager that refused to get an abortion. She chose this life. It can still be a good life with a career and a western husband but it won\u2019t be a life in Indian culture.", "NTA, there's not much you're going to be able to do at this point. She's lucky you guys stepped up so she could finish university.\n\nYou are going to get many 12 year old white kids with no knowledge of the Indian community giving you advice. Ignore them. I hope your daughter in time realizes the mistakes she's made and stops blaming others", "NTA. I\u2019m Indian and sadly, this is just the way our community works and I\u2019m a bit baffled that she doesn\u2019t realise this. If she really wants someone of the same culture then she can find someone on her own. If she wanted an arranged marriage, then sadly that ship has sailed for her - at that point she had no interest in it and like you say, wanted to follow Western traditions. She made that choice and now that is what she has available. Lots of Indians still successfully find other Desis this way! \n\nAfter a certain age and if you\u2019re divorced or have a kid, arranged marriage becomes unviable unless there is a good pool of widowers or divorc\u00e9es in the mix. \n\nYou\u2019re not an AH but this is a sad, but not novel problem. With so many of our parents migrating to Western countries, we Desi kids all struggle, as 1st or even 2nd gen, to find the balance between our culture and Western culture. When we are younger we love to rebel I think 99% of us have done it but your daughter\u2019s rebellion had huge consequences. Most of us eventually grow up and start to appreciate our culture. Perhaps it\u2019s where your daughter is but the truth is when you reject the culture/community-you can\u2019t then be surprised when you\u2019re ready to accept that they turn around and reject you.\n\nIt complicated and you\u2019re all doing the best you can. Wishing you good luck \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. She will be ripped to shreds. Very kindly she is far from what people are traditionally looking for in an Indian or any arranged marriage. She needs to kinda understand and accept that before she is hurt even more.", "Honestly anyone who isn\u2019t Indian is never going to understand the position you and your family are in. \n\nThe fact is that your daughter made a decision to live her like the way she wanted to and now she has to accept the certain consequences that come along with it. \n\nShe knows (whether she wanted to admit it or not) that no \u201cgood\u201d Indian family or boy will be willing to marry never married, single mom of a half black, half Indian child. That\u2019s why she wants you guys to be the ones who face the social and societal wrath that\u2019ll come from trying to find her a match and not have to face it herself. \n\nIt sucks that she\u2019s having a hard time being a single parent and finding a partner but it\u2019s not your job to make it easy on her.", "Nta, the commity is always extremely close nit and indians dont do children out of wedlock. You know the only reason she has to ask is because no one with a son has asked you for her for this exact reason.", "NTA. You are aware of the negative attention that trying to match her up with someone will realistically get her. Not only her but the entire family, including your grandchild. \n\nIf she understood that and thought the potential consequences were worth the risk, perhaps an arranged marriage could be considered as an option. But that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case, instead it seems she does not believe you and are convinced that you are trying to punish her, when in fact you are trying to protect her.\n\nIt is ironic that people are accusing you of being racist when in fact what you are doing is actively *preventing* racism from being directed towards your grandchild.", "NTA\n\nAs a white person with no indian friends, i can still notice these cultural implications. It sounds like it would be humiliating for her and your family, and i\u2019d want to protect her too.\n\nJust be empathetic about it. tell her that she is still worthy of love but she has a lifestyle that the indian community wouldn\u2019t accept and she should seek out people herself. there are other ways to meet people, like you said she can take the \u2018americanized\u2019 route and try tinder or something. you could still make it a rule that you have to meet & approve of them before they get serious", "She chose her path.\n\nUnfortunately not something she can unring.  She closed the door, not you", "No.\r  \nYour daughter made a decision, to have a relationship outside of her customs.\r  \nShe decided that she did not want to continue with the customs of her community.", "Sorry if this is a silly thought, but I wonder if \u201cimporting\u201d a husband from India might be an option? Just thinking in terms of what she brings to the table, the ability to help get someone into the US might be a powerful incentive to overlook the preexisting child", "NTA She grew up in the culture and knew that her actions have consequences. Reality is harsh and she needs to accept that when you step outside of tradition and do something extremely out of the norm, that same community won\u2019t see you the same. Especially with a kid which is permanent. Be honest with her that she\u2019s being rejected. She needs to stop acting like she\u2019s not a single mom now and should try to change her approach.", "I have no insight into Indian culture, but even I can guess that finding her a husband the traditional way is simply not an option after she chose to have her son. She's in denial and blaming you for the consequences of her decisions, but she'll have to find her own husband through modern means. Maybe she could move to Miami...", "NTA. You're just protecting her. That's how the Asian culture is. One of my cousins is married to a Black guy, has 3 kids, and some of her mom's friends talk shit about them all the time.", "NTA", "Idk if you\u2019re TA but you\u2019re likely not wrong that she should stick to Americanized dating. Considering the community she was born into appears to be super racially insensitive regarding her mixed raced baby and wildly judgmental of how he came into this world. That isn\u2019t any kind of environment to raise a small child in, especially if she has other children down the road in a more \u201csocially acceptable\u201d way. Will her first child be treated poorly because he was misfortunate enough to be born?", "NTA and I\u2019m sorry but I have to agree with your culture and I wish that it was like that within my family. I settled down with a teenage dad when I was 19 and it was the worst mistake of my life. It has been nothing but heartache, drama and trauma. If I could turn back time and never have met him I would in a heartbeat as honestly he ruined my life. His ex is a psycho and I have had to deal with that now for over twenty years. It wears you down. I would love to never see or hear that awful woman\u2019s name again. I actually have PTSD from it. \n\nShe needs to just concentrate on growing as a person and mum before worrying about dating I think. \n\nAnd parents should date parents, at least when you are young. It will make things a lot easier as it will be a more balanced relationship. And I am sure I will be downvoted for this as it sounds a bit harsh but unless you\u2019ve been in my shoes don\u2019t judge. \n\nI really do wish her well and hope she finds her happily ever after but it won\u2019t be with someone who won\u2019t date her simply because she has a child. She is setting herself up for heartache. \n\nShe deserves someone who will love her and accept her for who she is. She deserves happiness and a happy ever after but I don\u2019t think it will be where she is looking unfortunately.", "NTA.\n\nThe culture sounds racist af but you\u2019re one person and can\u2019t do anything about that and sounds like you have done well by your daughter and grandson.", "NTA\n\nWhatever objective morals might say about having a child out of wedlock or from a mixed background, the reality in the marriage market is very different\n\nYou haven\u2019t told your daughter that she or your grandchild are lesser, just the truth that she won\u2019t find matches in your community.\n\nNo auntie is going to even suggest her.\n\nMy own BIL is divorced after literally 3 months of marriage - they just didn\u2019t suit so they got divorced, and yet in the 2 years since he\u2019s been ready to look again he gets all sorts of weird matches suggested - women a decade older than him; widowed mothers - nobody of his age is taking him seriously as a prospect.\n\nUnfortunately the stigma against women is much worse.", "Ask her to make a profile on shaadi.com or something, she will understand the reality herself.", "NTA. I\u2019m as white as a ghost and by no means share your culture, but I know how it works. She\u2019s just not going to get anywhere. \n\nHowever, if it\u2019s within the bounds of your culture, and I really don\u2019t know if it is\u2014find John and wring him for child support.", "NTA. A family traditional enough for an arranged marriage is a family traditional enough that her OOW biracial child is a dealbreaker. No sense you pissing everybody off for something that is never, ever going to happen. Is that right? Is that fair? Probably not. But the world is what the world is.\n\n(Incidentally, I\u2019m a white dude who\u2019s had an Indian girlfriend.)", "Get her to watch Indian match maker on Netflix, I have, and I am not Indian. And even I know from watching it how hard it is for a woman with a child to find a match.. \n\nThere was another episode with a male looking for a match but no one was interested because his father went to prison. \n\nNta.", "I\u2019m reading all of the comments from the people who are Indian and I think NTA. I\u2019d encourage you to frame the situation in a way that shows her empathy. \u201cThe other people involved in matches are only interested in women who have never been married and have no children. They are also racist towards Black people. We want you to find a partner who respects and loves you and your son. We support you and are happy to watch baby [one a month or however often] so you can go on dates\u201d", "NTA but I\u2019ve watched Indian matchmaker lol.  Some of the criteria are out there, but I\u2019m yet to see anyone say they want someone who already has a kid\u2026\u2026\n\nSadly you are probably right.", "She needs to find an Indian man from Trinidad with blk family members. They are more fun, open-minded, and something new.", "NTA. This situation sounds like trying to walk into a northern Idaho bar with a Biden campaign worker lanyard and matching T-shirt and wondering why your teeth are missing the next day. Hate and dehumanization are a reality we have to confront. Daughter might as well try to clear a jammed wood chipper with your bare hands while the engine is still running. \n\nEverything here sucks, the daughter is oblivious to the ugliness she asking for, the deadbeat dad should be paying child support, and ma and pa might need to be planning a 529 and college prep for the grandson, as daughter seems content to let the world work things out for her.\n\nOP - your daughter needs to understand that what she is asking for is not going to meet her or her child's emotional, financial, or subsistence needs in a healthy way. Single moms are perfectly attractive human beings to many, many people, but the overall story suggests your daughter might lack the personal strength, maturity, and independence needed to make her situation an opportunity for happiness instead of a burden to the men she is dating. I would have no problem dating a single mom, but would run from someone looking for a surrogate parent for herself as well as her child.", "NTA \nShe took a huge risk and devalued herself\nShe should be thankful to her parents for forgiving her\nAnd before anyone hates this comment, why does no one ask where is the babys father, why did they break up, why has he left, does he pay child support\nShe had an entitled attitude and still does", "NTA. She's asking for a traditional marriage arrangement when she is already in violation of this arrangement.\n\nYou are TA for being concerned how this affects your social standing.\n\nBut its not realistic for her to seek a traditional arranged marriage in her current circumstance and being mad at you when she put herself in this situation is silly. It doesn't make you AH for telling her it's not possible.", "NTA.\n\nAm desi raised in Canada and personally experiencing arranged marriage things. I can say from experience that you are absolutely correct. The culture is way too close minded for your daughter's situation. She sounds desperate right now and this desperation will make her more vulnerable to accepting people/situations that are completely against her American values, which will later leave her feeling terrible and potentially abused. \n\nI know it's hard to look for a partner. The process can be draining. I do feel sympathy for her and hope she finds the strength to get through this struggle.", "I think the arranged marriage would be a bad idea for you and for your grandson and you\u2019re right in telling her to date the American way. I would hate to see the little boy be treated badly by his stepfather and/or new \u201cgrandparents,\u201d and looked down on by your traditional community. \n\nYour daughter chose to reject or at least ignore the rules and constraints of your culture when she got pregnant and keep the baby - having lied to you about her boyfriend- and that\u2019s her prerogative. Be free! Make your own choices. But then don\u2019t ask for an arranged marriage that A, is very unlikely to happen B would probably not be good for the child and C puts the parents in a position of humiliating themselves for an outcome you know won\u2019t work. \n\nYour daughter quite literally made her bed and now she needs to sleep in it. And if I were you I would find John and have his wages garnished for child support. The idea of a tall handsome rich Indian doctor agreeing to this marriage when he could have his pick is unrealistic. Especially since your daughter makes foolish choices and apparently wants someone else to pay the price for it.  \n\nThere are plenty of men who would find a young college educated woman an attractive mate even with a nice little boy. Let her find one on a dating site.", "Have you considered a non-East-Asian matchmaker?  She's been open to dating people from different cultures in the past.", "NTA. I am a (white) widow with 4 kids. All 4 of my children were born inside of wedlock and even I understand that I am no ones ideal choice for their son.  That doesn't mean I don't have great attributes or I'm not a good partner, but on paper,  no one wants a single parent for their adult  successful & unencumbered child unless there's no other choices.", "Good grief. The people here calling out YTA might learn a thing or two about other cultures, actually, instead of trying to force them all into the same moral strictures. This is one of the situations where cultural relativism applies.", "NTA. Your daughter deserves a good, loving husband. You\u2019re telling her she won\u2019t find it via the arranged marriage route.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t take it from you, doesn\u2019t she have any Indian friends that could tell her the same?", "OP I\u2019m an Indian too. You are right but here\u2019s what y\u2019all cal do: \n- ask your daughter to join Indian dating / marriage sites there are so many matrimonial websites \n- consider hiring a marriage broker \n- you are right that it\u2019s going to be a pain to get your daughter married and she\u2019ll struggle to find someone who\u2019s of her age and in similar circumstances the kind of proposals she\u2019ll most likely get is divorced Indian men or way older men - I\u2019d be extra cautious that she isn\u2019t getting scammed / taken on serious dates with the intent of a matrimonial only to be used to get physical intimacy as she\u2019s single with a child and never been married \n- start mentioning in friend circles about how great your daughter is and mention that she\u2019s interested in getting married this way you\u2019re indirectly letting the community know that your daughter wants to settle down this will raise some eyebrows and maybe get the community talking but our community likes to chatter so that\u2019s that maybe there\u2019s someone who knows someone with a similar background and or divorced who\u2019d consider marriage \n- also have a conversation about raising your grandchild the one case I know of is a girl who got married and had a child within one year and then got divorced her parents got her married but they kept the grandchild as most proposals did not want to care for the stepchild if you\u2019d be open to raising the child I would also bring it up seriously. \n- love marriage would be the easiest but if she\u2019s seriously looking to settle down get arranged then use matrimonial sites, community, and marriage brokers!", "NTA...  its a simple clash of 2 different cultures, your daughter has found out you cant cross back over the bridge she has burnt in her culture..  ,,,", "I'm not Indian but I get it.  I do work closely with three different 2nd generation Indian men and I already know what they'll say about this.  NTA.  She's already put so much stress on your family.  How does she not understand this?", "NTA. Firstly, guys opting for arranged marriage are already very conservative (mostly). There's a very small chance that a conservative/traditional guy would want to marry someone who had a child out of wedlock. These guys freakout if the girl even had a romantic relationship(even if there was no sex) before. One of my relatives was married through AM after she got pregnant out of wedlock and had an abortion. The guy knew about it beforehand but still used that to attack, blackmail her. He nearly beat her to death and went to jail for it (also got disowned by his parents). Your daughter deserves better. She'll be better off finding someone by herself.", "Nta", "NTA im Indian, the culture is completely different and you\u2019re doing the right thing OP. Your daughter made her bed and she can sleep in it.", "NTA  She needs to hear it from someone other than yourselves that she is no longer eligible to be a part of an arranged marriage because no one of the status that she is looking for would be willing to have their names and standing in the community brought down by the choices she herself has made. Perhaps a religious leader in your community. She will have to find her own way.", "NTA. Your daughter made a seriously bad lifestyle choice if she wanted to remain within conservative Indian circles. She was young and dumb, as most of us were at that age but hoping to be re-inserted into that lifestyle is looking like a non-starter. On the plus side, there is a great life to be had outside the traditional Indian community and she owes it to herself and her son to embrace it to the full. She's not the first Indian woman to make a non-traditional choice and have a half-black child, pretty sure VP Kamala Harris's mother could give her some advice on it.", "Eee, it's really hard to come up with a judgment here because OP is TA for some things and not for others. \n\nNOT the asshole for not wanting to subject your daughter to a system that will reject her. (I am not south Asian but am very familiar with Jewish matchmaking and there's a bunch of similarities.)  In matchmaking systems people get ranked and if the stereotype makes you a \"low quality\" match that's all you'll get shown. And the other people in the system tend to be ones who want traditional matches. Even if her kid were Indian too, having a baby out of wedlock would make her less desirable in this kind of system. She's better off somewhere where men would get to know her first. Even a matchmaking website. \n\nHowever, I'm getting a bit of an asshole vibe from the \"it would make us look worse\" part and some of the comments.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

While she was in school she gets into this relationship with this guy call him John.Initially she tells us John also went to the same school as her but we later discover that was a lie. And in reality he worked random jobs. In her junior year she ends up getting pregnant by him we beg her to abort the baby. She ends up leaving that semester and we end up helping her raise our grandson. John says he is going to Miami and disappears.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n My daughter moved back in with us and we raised our grandson while she finished her degree online.This whole process we all have gotten close again and we love our grandson. About 1 year and 4 months ago she moved out to her own apartment near by and got a job as well.\n\n  \nShe has been dating and meeting guys on her own now and hasn\u2019t had much luck. She now has been asking me and my wife to introduce her to guys through the Indian community with good jobs that are looking to settle down.\n\n  \nThe fact that she already has a kid and the fact that the kid is half black and the fact she was never married either makes it so much worse. Me asking around just brings more drama to our family and harms our social relationships. Daughter doesn\u2019t see this way she sees it as another form of punishment from us. From what I can tell she doesn\u2019t like the work and effort of being a single parent and thinks her only way of improving her work life balance is finding a man to help split the effort. We have tried to tell her softly that she should stick to Americanized dating as we don\u2019t think she would have a lot of luck.\n\n  \nHowever, she kept pressing us to help her find a guy. The reality is that having children out of wedlock is not part of Indian culture at all, and two the fact that her son is half black will also make it impossible to find a match. She has pressed us to try despite that. But there are two things, 1. Not one person has expressed interest in our daughter, at weddings, prayers no one has approached us to ask us if our daughter was open to meeting their son. 2. I feel that us asking around will make our family look worse if anything and damage our relationships with people in the community.My wife and I have had tense discussions with our daughter, and she views us bad guys.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your daughter made her choices; she cannot change the culture. What she *can* do is not expose her child to a culture that wouldn\u2019t accept him anyway and would make his life more difficult. She\u2019s fortunate to have her parents unconditional love. It\u2019s unfortunate that you hold your social status in higher regard than her ability to have a match made, but at least you\u2019re honest about it.

I\u2019m Indian and I understand the difference between the arranged marriage market in western countries and mainstream dating in those countries. \n\nArranged marriage is conservative and transactional and if you don\u2019t comply with the rules and prejudices (no matter how wrong or infuriating they are) then you aren\u2019t going to have any luck. The overseas diaspora are in some ways even more conservative than people in India because they have retained the mindset of the past generation when they or their parents emigrated from India.\n\nI don\u2019t agree with the conservative value system and even if I manage to get an arranged marriage I would be miserable. I very much doubt that your daughter will be happy with an arranged marriage even if she gets a match.", "NTA - people don\u2019t understand if you want access to traditional marriages you will have to meet traditional expectations.

I'm not Indian, but Asian, and if I was in the same scenario as your daughter, the judgment and rudeness from my extended family and community would be insane. I would not want more attention at all. You are right in that your daughter does not conform to the expectations of your community, and in all likelihood, even if you did manage to arrange a marriage for her, both parties would end up unhappy.\n\nTo add on to that, imagine the racism that her child would face! I am also mixed, Asian and white, and that's fortunate due to the fact that casual racism isn't uncommon in my family, and neither is colorism. If your daughter managed to marry a more traditional Indian man, based on your post, he would likely disapprove of her child because of his race.\n\nYour daughter is being an AH to herself and her kid by trying to marry someone from a community who will likely treat them poorly and disapprove of them. You seem to be trying to protect them both.", "NTA. Meeting new people as a single parent is difficult for anyone from any culture. Asking mum and dad to find someone to volunteer to take on a single mother, without getting to know the mum in a casual dating scenario, is unreasonable.", "NTA, but maybe you can find someone with a child themselves. That's the only was I see an arranged marriage working. Unless your daughter wants someone childless to take care of her kid, then she's a hypocrite asking for the impossible.", "It's a terrible situation but unfortunately it's the way that the system works. You should try to explain in clear words that the type of loving person you would like her to end up with will be extremely difficult to find in the arranged marriage setup considering the preferences of most within the community but that you will try to get the word out that she is interested in marriage. \n\nThe problem with arranged marriages when you don't fit the typical criterion is that when folks start looking at matches there can be so many options and unusual 'profiles' land at the bottom of bulk of peoples lists. \n\nIt's a numbers game. When you have to decide who to meet among the people who sound interesting, (especially if you don't firsthand know the people involved) then most folks tend to try to first shortlist and give preference to people who are superficially ideal- and very few peoples idea of an ideal 'profile' includes 'has children' with even single parents often preferring childless spouses when open to looking at people who were in a relationship before. \n\nIf you look at online arranged portals this is even more strongly the case- how else would one sort through literally hundreds of thousands of possible matches, without trying to use some kind of filter. \n\nA lot of people looking at arranged marriages can be extremely conservative and a previous relationships and child out of wedlock would be a deal breaker for them, and that is after excluding the race of the child which is an automatic veto by a lot of conservatives. \n\nEven those who are open minded will probably end up matching with one of the first dozen options they will meet, as the first choice of most people who are trying to meet people is not 'unmarried young women at the beginning of their career with an interracial child'. While the tag sounds harsh, for strangers looking to see what is unique about each profile this is often what will be put across and she should understand it'll be a long wait to get married with lots of gossiping, judgement from people she will meet, rejections and embarrassing moments of meeting people who may later end things with a 'sorry we don't think it'll work' or the occasional less polite 'sorry you are not ideal'\n\n\nHowever if even after understanding this she still wants to try, maybe you should let her go through the process of talking to people on matrimony portals while you let the community know that she's open to marriage. Your reputation among the gossipmongers is already 'the couple with unmarried daughter with the interracial child'  a fresh bout of gossip may be hard to bear but may be worth the potential of showing that you are a supportive parents, even if it bears no result. And who knows maybe your daughter will find a match who loves her for who she is. \n\nMaybe you should show her the responses to your post. Sometimes hearing strangers tell you the same thing as those close to you gets the message across better.", "NTA. She didn't want to play by the rules. Fine. The rules FUCKIN SUCK. But now she sees that there were benefits to the game. An arranged marriage often guarantees some form of stability - financial, status, etc. so now she wants back in the game after doing something irreversible. Maybe when she was making her choice, she didn't have the best advisors around her. But now I just feel bad for the poor kid who is going to become the target of her inevitable resentment. He deserves better. She needs to get her shit together. Respectfully. There are plenty of men out there to date. If she's unsuccessful there, I doubt an arranged marriage will be successful either. She needs to work on herself, for everyone's sake.", "All the Yta here clearly have no idea. \n\nOP isn't trying to protect their social life because it's already kinda destroyed the moment OP's daughter decided to have a child out of wedlock. And OP is quite supportive because most Indian parents would cut off their kids after this.\n\n\nEven though whether the child is black/white/half asian the fact it is out of wedlock is like a huge crime (ik it sounds exaggerated). The kid would be called names (things no kid should hear) .  For example there were two famous actors who got married and had their first kid within 5 months of marriage and it was a huge issue all over internet about how she was pregnant before marriage.  And yeah PPL here prefer white colour (deep rooted colonialism left by Britishers) .", "NTA. Never did you say you agree with the community\u2019s judgements. Just that they exist and are hard to live with. If people who feel that way about single mothers and black children are prevalent in that circle, she should absolutely stay out of it. Nobody like that should be in her life. She has a baby to protect, and herself. Single motherhood is so hard. But being looked down on and treated badly in exchange for better financial security is, in my opinion, far harder and not something anyone should endure.", "NTA. I am an Indian, and I can say with confidence that you are doing the right thing. The Indian community is not that open to a single, successful guy marrying a single mom who had a child out of wedlock. Even if a guy becomes interested in her, which would be rare, he would face lots of backlash from his family and might even get disowned by his parents. I don't think anyone would risk that. Also, Indians are inherently racist. They won't accept a biracial child, especially the parents and grandparents. At best, she might be able to match up with a divorced guy who is a lot older than him and has children of his own but even those chances are slim.\n\nI know it sounds really harsh, but it is the Indian truth.", "I get it.\n\nShe needs to get reality checked. She needs a non traditional Indian boy. The people you meet at mandir are going to be gossipy repressive tools.\n\nShe's gotta actually date.\n\nNAH", "NTA\n\nGoodness gracious. The audacity of this girl to lead an untraditional life and have a child out of wedlock, and then expect others to clean up her mess with a traditional arranged marriage to a man who will have to take care of her and her child. I commend you for looking after your daughter and putting up with her shit, but this is very much her problem to deal with. It would be unfair to subject another man to an arranged marriage to your daughter with how she behaves. She needs a reality check.", "INFO: Have you consulted with a matchmaker? Maybe you might find one that would be willing to take on the challenge if you aren't.", "NTA. I don't like the idea of arranged marriages and my knowledge of the Indian community is limited at best. But you know the likelihood of finding a match for your daughter in this situation. Having been raised in the community, your daughter does, too. \n\nYour daughter made the choice to live her life outside of the values she knows exists. She chose to keep her child out of wedlock. She knew that decision would make it impossible for an arranged marriage within the community but chose that road anyway. \n\nShe now has a choice to make. Keep dating outside of the community as she has been. Or stop dating that way and accept she'll stay a single mother. \n\nI don't know how blunt you've been, but I think you need to be very blunt. Tell her straight, no one in the Indian community will agree to an arranged marriage for their son with her. This is no longer an option open to her.

You offered her an out. You warned her.", "I agree that it would be actually insulting to other families at this point to suggest such a thing", "Genuine question - if the kid was *not* half black, would it make much difference, or is the out of wedlock part the more pressing issue?", "Normally, I would say arranging a marriage for your daughter automatically makes you the asshole.  Nobody should be forced to marry someone they don\u2019t love\u2026\n\n\u2026but that\u2019s not what we have here.  She asked you to arrange a marriage.

I could wish you were less concerned with how it all makes you look, but I am well aware that wouldn't change the situation that arranging a marriage for her is unlikely to go well. \n\nPerhaps you could offer to connect her with a matchmaker that is outside your culture?", "NTA ur daughter made stupid choices and now wants mommy and daddy to help bail her out.", "NTA.  I'm asian and married to a Caucasian.  I have 2 kids.  If I ever divorce, I know my dating within my culture is very slim.  As nontraditional as I am, I accept it and understand why.

No, I made this decision.\n\nYou daughter needs to understand her decision to become an unwedded single mother made your job to arrange her marriage close to impossible.  Whose mother will approve of such a match to their beloved son?", "It's hard to have an opinion while not a part of the Indian community or culture.. but I feel like she chose American culture and had a child knowing what that would mean for her in the Indian community and the consequence is that she's not that desirable in Indian culture because of her choice.. so..

But, in general, we don\u2019t do arranged marriages here.  My parents said, on that topic, they would never do such a thing for a lot of reasons, but one of them was because in case it didn\u2019t turn out well, they didn\u2019t want to take the blame for that.\n\nYour daughter is going to have a very hard time settling down with a guy as a single mom.  Most men will date single moms but very few will marry them.  I\u2019ll probably get downvoted for this, but that\u2019s how it is.\n\nGood luck to you both.  This is a tough one.", "NTA. I think you have to be realistic about what the expectations are within the Indian community for arranged marriage candidates. I mean the standards are so rigid and arbitrary and often superficial (height, weight, skin color, looks). They\u2019re generally looking for women under 30 and often they don\u2019t even want someone who has dated seriously or lived with anyone. \n\nSomeone who already has a child would be very hard to match, especially since she was not married. Unfortunately there is a lot of racism in the community so the race of the child would likely make it even harder, though the existence of a child is probably a dealbreaker on its own. \n\nBut you should approach her with some empathy. Reading between the lines, you still seem to be resentful that she has made the choices she has and has ended up where she is. It\u2019s fair enough \u2014 she rejected your counsel and has ended up in a tough spot and now wants you to act as if she didn\u2019t make those choices, even though both you and she have suffered reputation-wise in the Indian community. \n\nMaybe you don\u2019t want to help her find a match because you don\u2019t want to deal with further judgment. But maybe focus on the fact that you\u2019re also protecting her from the negativity she will face. Ultimately there\u2019s nothing that would stop her from reaching out to her Indian friends from her younger days and letting them know that she is interested in meeting someone. But she should be prepared that the guys whose families might be willing to consider her could have some issues that she might find to be dealbreakers.", "I just wonder if the real issue is that she got knocked up by a black man instead of a white man.", "I don\u2019t feel good about voting because I feel weird about judging other cultures.

Think of it as a peasant\u2019s version of aristocratic culture.", "The kid being born out of wedlock, from a foreigner and being dark-skinned are all issues for Desis.", "There is a difference between arranged marriage and forced marriage", "You don't understand what he means by arranged marriage. She still gets to choose. It's more like your parents are the dating app.", "I used to have the same understanding of 'arranged marriage' as you, but having since met friends in a wide variety of situations, I've come to understand that the western view of 'arranged marriage = abusive' is not accurate. There's a spectrum of behavior. For many people, especially in the Indian community like OP, 'arranged marriage' just means that their parents or someone else in their family introduced them to someone who they believed would be a good match, and both parties were aware that they were looking at a relationship that, if successful, would soon end in marriage. My friends who have been in these types of relationships still took a lot of time to get to know the person they were being set up with, and could have said no at any point. In most of the cases, they were the ones who asked their parents to help them meet someone by starting to look for someone who might be a good fit for them.\n\nI'm not saying every arranged marriage actually happens that way. I have another friend who is estranged from his family because his parents decided to essentially say that he was engaged to a girl that he barely knew, without him ever asking them to make a match for him, and when he refused to go along, they became very angry with him. And in some cultures and parts of the world, there are still marriages where one or both parties are forced into it, where women and girls in particular are vulnerable to being forced into a marriage because legally, their male relatives have the right to make those types of decisions for them, or where boys are forced to marry their brother's widows even though they might be far too young/not want to. (I've also worked in international human rights and have definitely seen cases like that.)\n\nBut the point is that the term 'arranged marriage' itself doesn't always mean the latter, and when used by Indian communities in the US, it's very frequently quite similar to going to a matchmaker: You are asking someone to set you up with a person they think you would be compatible with, knowing that you both have the same goals about getting married soon. You still have the right to refuse. You still have autonomy and agency. It's only when people are abusive, toxic, and controlling, that the system becomes abusive, too.", "You're talking about \"forced marriage.\"", "As an Asian, getting knocked up out of wedlock is worse.

But that to me is a reason OP and the daughter need to start building a chosen community around this child, one that will accept him in all of the various facets of his identity. The fact that OP is worried about preserving their standing as a member of a community that doesn\u2019t think the grandson should exist, and that OP plans to continue to raise the grandson around those people, really worries me.", "Forget dating and relationships. My daughter before she had her kid was on an amazing track to do great in the business world. Her peers that are now working are making 5-6 times her salary now. The choices we make have huge consequences.", "She has clearly outlined that she believed her daughter should continue to pursue Western dating, because clearly she doesn't believe that being a single mother is something that would be frowned upon in that community. But in cases of arranged marriages, where the ties are being made using the explicit factors or similar backgrounds, culture, race, and success, her situation in unattractive.", "Anti-blackness, like homophobia, was imported to many places through colonialism.", "White ppl don't like anybody that's not white, don't let them fool you.", "My marriage was technically arranged by my cousin (younger than either of us, lol!)

I've been up about 36 hours straight. I missed the very first part and while I can't claim to have an indepth knowledge of Indian culture I don't like it when people talk about things a certain way. I'll take it down if you want. I'm just a bit delirious", "Because it seriously complicates your life? Even in the best of circumstances, you\u2019re signing up for a more difficult path if you get with a single parent.", "Even in America there are men and women who don\u2019t want to date single parents and that\u2019s a valid. It isn\u2019t right but it isn\u2019t wrong either.  One thing we as people have to realize is that every action we take has a reaction. If I was having kids out of wedlock and were single, I can\u2019t be mad at a woman who wants nothing to do with me because of that fact. It was my decision to have a child and it would be her decision to avoid dating me because of said child.", "There\u2019s a difference between understanding something and condoning it.", "Is it really so weird when it adds a whole assortment of complications to your life? There\u2019s nothing *wrong* with single parents, but I\u2019m also going to \u201cjudge\u201d them as incompatible with the life I want because I just don\u2019t have the energy to deal with even the best coparenting situation. A kid is *kind of a big deal*. Of course it\u2019s going to be something people have strong opinions about bringing into their own lives.", "Sad thing is I\u2019ve heard other single moms want the same thing- man who doesn\u2019t have any kids while they have one or more kids themselves.", "(Not targeted at OP)\n\nI love when people point this out, so many older people constantly talking about how people don't take \"marriage seriously anymore\" or some sh*t but don't like to acknowledge the fact that there was no legal way out at one point and there was so much social pressure that even when there was a way out most didn't because they'd lose everything.\n\nI had a coworker of Indian heritage/ culture and she divorced her abusive husband, her sons blamed her and her other family shunned her. She has a strained relationship with her sons now. She survived breast cancer twice, she is an incredible woman it's very sad her culture made things difficult for her.", "Not OP but guessing if a person was raised in a traditional Indian household they'd be considered a better fit.  That's normal- shared values and culture make for smoother relationships in general.", "Probably depend on what the other half is.", "Good man - make them explicitly spell out their own bigotry.  Follow up - if a family asked you if you know of any non-straight Indian men or women, how would you respond?  Would you judge the family and spread gossip or search your network for a suitable alliance?", "Of course he doesn't.", "Yeah - it\u2019s very different now. There is more agency for the the potential partners. Maybe if someone showed up and met her they would be charmed and willing, the problem is that (as someone else pointed out) when you have the budget for a brand new car you\u2019re not going to get the used car when looking on it on paper. And it is literally like that, parents create and submit \u201cbio-datas\u201d to each for this type of arrangement, once the parents approve they\u2019ll pass it onto their child. You\u2019ll never get past the parent stage unless they also have a car that is less than desirable - a car which OP says his daughter does not want.", "Are you Indian?? This is absolutely a big deal.", "I\u2019m not Indian but I grew up in one of the largest Indian communities in my state and have Indian friends and know the thinking of their old school parents. The ship for an arranged marriage has sailed.", "Do you understand how social hierarchies in Indian communities work?", "It is a big deal, you have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.", "She may find someone who does not care that she\u2019s a single mom or even adores it but that\u2019s not going to be the arranged married sort of person. As someone said upstream a family traditional enough to want an arranged marriage is traditional enough that they don\u2019t want an out of wedlock child. \nThat\u2019s the community her parents are in. She rejected that. As she probably should, it\u2019s misogynist imo.  But it\u2019s not up to mom and dad to go barter for her. It\u2019s up to the girl to find a mate herself.", "It only tells us you aren't smart either. She wanted help. He made a judgment call. Get outta here.", "It's not judgemental to play according to the rules of your culture and, in turn, expect your partner to do the same in the confines of a consentual relationship. Unless you think it's judgemental to not screw every person that asks you.", "And the daughter wants to be a racist??? With a mixed child?", "Your club analogy is actually perfect.  Let\u2019s say you were part of Club A but as part of the club bylaws they said you cannot join any other clubs. You decide F that Ima go join other clubs, which is your right.  You decide later that financially it is better for you to go back to club A\u2026 but guess what you can no longer join that club and now you\u2019re crying to your parents that you need be let back in when they know it\u2019s not going to happen? How\u2019s that the parents fault???", "I\u2019m saying that OP is the AH for their attitude towards their daughter and grandson, not for not trying to set her up. Geeeeeez", "As a fellow South Asian, yes it matters more. Because chances are if the child passes as the same race as the new dude they might be a bit more open minded about it. But if at a glance the child definitely looks like it can\u2019t be the couple\u2019s own kid it\u2019s a worse situation to the child out of wedlock crime. Not my opinion, just stating a fact about our culture.", "Did you read the comment I\u2019m responding to? He is literally saying that he doesn\u2019t believe American men will want to date her either.", "Right, but he is saying that America men wouldn\u2019t want to be in a relationship with a single mom who has a biracial child. My argument is based on how America typically dates, which doesn\u2019t have a culture of arranged marriages.", "Right, I\u2019m responding to his comment about America men. And American dating is for love.", "OP, you're NTA. I suggest you have your daughter participate in social interactions and hear from other Indian parents what they consider her marriage prospects to be. It will be a brutal dose of reality and hard for you to hear as well but it will help her gain realistic perspectives in regards to her status as a single mom. \n\nI'm aware of social norms and prejudice towards single moms having children out of marriage and I'm not even Indian. I'm honestly surprised and she sounds a bit oblivious.", "To clarify, I\u2019m replying to OP\u2019s follow-up comments where they have stated things such as, \u201cThe world however views her as less attractive.\u201d They\u2019ve expanded the scope from their original post via these comments.

Please don't be so condescending. Other races are perfectly capable of being racist without having to blame it on white colonialism.", "Ah okay makes sense, thanks for clarifying :)", "So it\u2019s white peoples fault that Indians are racist?", "Indians are not white though?", "Don\u2019t make gross generalizations.", "Nah, it's fine.", "You don't have to date them. Why look down on them? There's plenty of people I wouldn't date, but that doesn't mean they're lacking in some way. I'm just not attracted to them.", "Okay, but it seems you don\u2019t want kids at all. There are people who _do_ want kids and see them as compatible with the life they want but won\u2019t date single parents.", "The thought process is often thinking the man would mistreat her children or (naturally)treat his children differently. Also, baby mama drama is always very real.", "There used to be thriving businesses selling poisons so that an abused wife could kill her husband", "lol again. Racism as a \u201cculture\u201d isn\u2019t anything to get excited about. Have a good one.", "Maybe? Or maybe \u2014 unlike her parents \u2014 she thinks that not every Indian is necessarily an anti-Black bigot and wants to meet one, while not caring about what the racists might think.", "It's not the parents fault that the club is racist. I was just answering the question about how the parents are racist for choosing to be in a club that won't accept their own daughter and grandchild because of how racist they are.", "There is no attitude. OP stated they loves their grandson but understands that it only hinders her ability to be wedded in an arrange marriage.  So don\u2019t geeeeeeeeeeeez me.", "I\u2019m specifically talking about how the parent speaks of their grandchild and seeing as there is a huge colorism issue and antiblackness in south Asian culture that\u2019s an issue. Global really. Also I think they are staying in western country the daughter is just asking for an arrangement while staying in that western country which obviously happens", ">he doesn\u2019t believe American men will want to date her either.\n\nCurrent situation suggests that he is correct though. No matter how hard you clutch your pearls, she's only asking them to find her a husband because American(?) men won't date her.", "Some would. Some would not. Reddit alone should tell you the outrageous expectations American men and man-boys have and how extremely misogynist this culture is.

It is not just traditional Indian culture. \nDepending on the race and politics of the man the kid\u2019s race might not matter but I think we\u2019re fooling ourselves if we think this wouldn\u2019t be a problem for many. And that\u2019s not considering that she isn\u2019t looking for love but for a man to support her. What is she bringing to that party? Just her appetite?", "Agreed, original post is fine but the comments make me think this is actually a fairytale of some MRA-type person.", "Why would that be shocking? Separately from me already knowing that. It\u2019s also true for China, though in China colorism was related to classism, which I know is also intertwined with the caste system in India as well.", "They had a strict caste system with darker skin colors being lower value ***long*** before the English arrived.
