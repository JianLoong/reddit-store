My husband Mike (39M) was with our other three kids holding down the fort. My dog is a mutt and weighs around 90 pounds. His vet thinks he is a lab mix of some kind. He\u2019s the sweetest dog on the planet and so patient with my kids who are all under 7 while he\u2019s around 11 years old.\n\nWhile heading back toward my house there was a couple walking their smaller dog, a terrier of some kind I think, on the same side of the street as I am. The couple was maybe 2 to 3 houses from me at the time when they yelled \u201cCross!\u201d at me over and over. My house was between me and the couple at the time. I stopped for a second and figured they were yelling to let me know they were crossing the street so I kept with my dog and stroller towards home. I had no intention of crossing the street since I was on the same side of the street as my house and had my infant son with me.\n\nThe man became kind of aggressive with me while I kept trying to get to my house and kept yelling Cross over and over. I tried to explain that he was standing in front of my house and I wanted to get my baby home. He told me he didn\u2019t care and it wasn\u2019t his problem. About this point my husband had come outside (that\u2019s how loud this guy was) and told him to leave me alone. This guy turned to my husband and started screaming in his face. Honestly I was scared of this man. He kept going on and on about I had no manners and that since I had the bigger dog it was my responsibility to cross when coming up on others with a smaller dog. \n\nMy dog has never been aggressive with anyone or any other dogs. Like I said we have four kids under 7 and we have 2 cats. He\u2019s a sweet boy. During the entire ordeal my dog just sat down next to me and the baby. He was leashed (unlike their dog) and super calm while their little dog was running all around barking constantly. Mike told them to get off our property as the man had gotten in his face and was in our front yard to allow me, my dog and our baby to come back home. At this point my next door neighbor (who\u2019s house I had stopped in front of during the confrontation) came out as well. He basically escorted the three of us up my drive way so I could get my baby inside who had started crying with all the noise. \n\nBefore the man and his wife finally left he called me an asshole for not following \u201ccommon courtesy\u201d in crossing the street. I don\u2019t feel like I should have been expected to since I was going home and only a few houses down from my house when this all first started.", "created_utc": 1701564494, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/189hl9u/aita_for_not_crossing_the_street_with_my_dog/", "score": 467, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And their dog was off leash too, OFC.", "10000% NTA.\n1) your dog was on a leash & theirs wasn\u2019t.\n2) your dog has no issues with other dogs.\n3) you had an infant in a stroller.\n\nThe proximity to your house has NOTHING to do with it.\n\nIf their dog is the dog with problems THEY need to move, for THEIR dogs safety. \n***IF their dog went after your dog, whether they won or loss, they would be at fault. \n\nNext time you need to call the police and say there is someone with an off leash dog screaming at you and blocking you from getting to your home.", "Next time call the cops that you are afraid of the man preventing you from going into your house and that you have a baby.

That\u2019s really all there is to say- he\u2019s the irresponsible one and he\u2019s the one who should\u2019ve crossed if he was so concerned about his (unleashed) dog getting into trouble. The audacity.", "NTA. The person who is uncomfortable passing by another dog is the one who should cross. You had a dog and an infant, you should not have had to cross the street by default due to safety. They are not only entitled by expecting you to cross, but also by walking with their dog off leash.", "NTA, and also wrong. \n\n\"Common courtesy\" is that if YOU don't want to walk near someone? YOU cross the damn street. Plain and simple.", "NTA. If this happens again, scream \"LEASH!!\" until the dumbass gets the hint.", "NTA.  He didn't even have his dog on a leash and \"the people with the bigger dog cross the street\" isn't a thing anyway.", "It doesn't even matter if your house was close or not. If they have a conflictive dog, or a problem with bigger dogs, they are the ones that need to cross the street. Plus you had a stroller and they had what? Their big egos? The nerve of some people...\n\nNTA.", "NTA\nThat guy was an angry idiot. I'm glad you made it home safe", "Absolutely NTA! 2 adults with 1 small dog vs single woman with larger dog AND a 4 month old baby in a stroller? A 3 year old could figure out that the couple should cross! No other info is even necessary. That man was a major AH who still didn't even back down when he realized he was blocking you from your own home, or when your husband, and even the neighbor came out? Honestly, you should report him. He's unhinged and a menace to society. If he does that in public, wtf does he do behind closed doors???", "NTA\n\nFirst, your dog was leashed.  They were in the wrong for not leashing their dog.    \nNext, you don\u2019t always need to keep dogs away from one another.  My dog loves to meet new dogs and sniff butts.  If we get fairly close to another dog while walking, I always ask if their dog is dog friendly or if we need to detour.  Frequently, the dogs sniff one another, and then we move on.\n\nThird, he was blocking your home.  He was the one who wanted to avoid you, so it was HIs responsibility to cross to avoid you.    \nSorry you met an AH there.", "Let me get this straight. Your dog was leashed? Theirs was not?

When I see another dog, I pick Fred up fast and, if necessary, *I cross the street.*", "How exactly is screaming going to calm his unleashed  dog down? NTA.

If their dog is the reactive one, that\u2019s their problem to solve. Nothing was stopping them from crossing yet they chose to escalate the situation. They were completely out of line.", "NTA.  Anybody have cameras that caught this confrontation?", "NTA. It seems their dog takes after the owner. Yap yappity yap thinking they\u2019re king shit. Or maybe vice versa.

My real thoughts about that man would get my comment removed, but suffice to say he is 1000% in the wrong and a rude narcissist to boot. Sidewalks are for everyone, if they\u2019re uncomfortable with that then they need to stay home. My (small) dog is very friendly, but I always keep him leashed and near me and won\u2019t let him approach other people/dogs unless they\u2019re okay with it. It\u2019s that simple. If I\u2019m ever uncomfortable bringing him past someone/another dog, it would be my responsibility as a dog owner to remove both of us from the situation. The audacity of that man is astounding. I admire your family\u2019s self control because I would have reacted in a much louder and angrier manner.", "I have never heard of this \"common courtesy\" of leaving your side of the street because you have a bigger animal. WTF is that?", "100% nta. Theyre welcome to cross the street if they feel uncomfortable with their unleashed, untrained dog. It\u2019s just so rude that they expected you to get a stroller down and up another curb with a large dog to allow them to cross. Common courtesy is just moving over on the sidewalk so there\u2019s room for everyone", "NTA. This is not a common practice at all! I have a large lab mix who is 90lbs and if a man was yelling at me to \u201ccross\u201d the street while he was standing in front of my house I would have told him to F off and probably call the police.", "NTA haha what? if they do not want to be near your dog, they should move. There's no \"bigger dog\" rule. I'm sorry he screamed at you, his behavior from the start was aggressive and arrogant. \n\nMy dog does not always react well to other dogs because we have had to many run-ins with owners who do not control them. She has been jumped on and growled at by dogs passing on the sidewalk, and she's 70lb of mush. She won't hurt anyone but she will posture if she thnks they are getting too close now.  So it's MY job to remove her. If there's another dog coming our way, we pull over and sit until they pass. If there's an unleashed dog that comes up to us, I will defend us both and have no qualms about it. It's the owner's problem for not following laws and having common sense.", "Nta common courtesy is to leash your dog, which they didn't do, which you had done. Maybe and this comes down to training I don't cross the street with my dogs, they are both trained to 'sit' when I want people to pass us or 'ignore' if I need to pass people. Sounds like they have a poorly trained dog and expect everyone to accommodate them.  Because personally I would have told the guy 'my dogs are sitting you figure your own dog out'", "Nope. My dad has an extremely dog reactive 90lb pitbull. Guess who has been trained to SIT AND STAY on a short lead while the other dog goes the other direction. This works because he's in a small apartment complex, knows the neighbors with dogs, and asks nicely if it's someone who doesn't know Bubba.", "NTA\u2014A calm, well-mannered on-leash dog being walked by a person with a baby in a stroller is not obligated to cross the street.  I had a small dog who would not hurt a fly and was always on a leash, but I would pick him up and cross the street to avoid encounters with larger dogs or even other small, but clearly overly excited dogs.  Applause for your neighbor who stepped up to help you, btw.  And if anything like this happens again, call the cops and start recording the miscreants with your phone to have a record to show the police.  Unfortunately, the idiots know where you live, so you may want to invest in a security camera system and watch your dog when he\u2019s in your yard, in case the idiots try to poison him.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019d crosspost this to r/EntitledBitch, tbh", "I would have yelled back at them \"leash, leash, leash!\"", "NTA that man is deranged and a menace. They should be fined for not having their dog on a leash and it would be their fault if it got hurt. Common courtesy would be to let a woman with a stroller (or anyone) WALK TO THEIR HOUSE. If they didn\u2019t want to cross the street they could have\u2026. STOOD STILL. Good lord.", "The RULE is have your dog on a leash.  That's not only \"common courtesy\" but it's usually the LAW.\n\nNTA of course", "NTAH.  If he shows up again, remind this wanker that there are leash laws as well.", "NTA if they're afraid of your dog, *they* can cross the street.\n\nThat being said, is your dog a pit bull mix?

A person cannot stay away from the small dog in front of their home and still go home.\n\nSo like, the situation is just full of reasons that are sufficient and not mutually necessary for the guy to be astonishingly wrong.\n\nAgain, broadly, you are 100% right, just highlighting that the house point does add to the absurdity.", "This right here! Call the police! An off-leash dog and screaming AH is never a good combo!", "Yes, exactly this!  That guy and his wife wouldn't know common courtesy if it bit them in the rear end.  Them trying to enforce rules they made up themselves is ridiculous.  They were incredibly rude, demanding, aggressive, and very likely breaking leash laws.", "As someone who has an asshole for a dog, I agree. We're the problem so we need to come up with solutions. My dog would absolutely instigate a fight and then lose so for everyone's well-being and peace of mind, we move and actively avoid others on walks. To leave the situation up to someone else who doesn't know my dog is an asshole is negligent.", "ooooh, well played.", "Police will be RIGHT over.", "Again, report it NOW. THIS incident has an uninvolved witness (the other neighbor) Even after the fact having on record may encourage this guy to avoid her street in future", "I\u2019m kinda convinced a majority of people that own dogs are assholes. It\u2019s wild the amount of people that won\u2019t pick up after their dog, keep it under control, or give it enough care and attention. Maybe I\u2019m biased since my dog is my baby though.", "Yeah, this is the real key, it's totally irrelevent that they were almost home.", "Yes! My dog is a bit of freak show on lead, so we always step aside and I put him in a down as people and their dogs go by. My problem is other people seeing me do this, and come up to us anyway to try and have the dogs make friends. I am like, read the room here!", "Right? Once I was out for my morning walk, and who should come walking down the sidewalk right toward me but a skunk! You can imagine how fast I crossed the street, LOL. \n\nBut you're exactly right- the one who has the problem is the one who needs to cross the street. This whole \"the owner of the bigger dog needs to cross the street\" is not a thing. And yelling \"Cross!\" is not exactly a way to win friends and influence people. If there was a compelling reason I could not cross the street (I had a broken leg and was just standing with my dog in a tiny strip of grass while he did his business) I would say, \"I'm so sorry- my dog doesn't always get along well with other dogs. Would you mind crossing the street?\" I'll bet OP would have done it gladly if they hadn't been such jerks about it.", "This is a great suggestion, IMO.", "Brilliant.", "Check on what the fine is for unleashed dogs in your municipality and scream that back, too!", "your last sentence/question is likely why his dog is so neurotic!", "I was thinking the same thing, he\u2019s lucky he didn\u2019t scream in my husband\u2019s face after yelling at me.", "really loving the visual of your chihuahua squaring up to a completely indifferent police dog.", "I also have a chihuahua that thinks everyone needs to bow down to him. I usually take him and my chow mix together on walks and somehow he is less of a dick on walks with her. I call her his emotional support animal.", "Or they could pick the stupid rat up and save everybody the trouble.", "Pitbull mix would change absolutely nothing in this scenario. Get outta here with that trash.\n\nClear cut, NTA.", "No he\u2019s not a pittie mix. He\u2019s lab and likely a heeler mix based on his size and coloring per our vet. He\u2019s a big doofy ass dog who wouldn\u2019t attack a burglar if someone broke in but rather beg for ear rubs. He may also knock you over with his tail wags.", "When we had terriers (Scottish) who were assholes we would always cross the street to not encounter other dogs unless the other party crossed first. I had the terrible dogs so why would I make someone else cross?", "That is the rule. Know your dog, if it\u2019s unruly, take care to not let that impact people. Yelling at you to cross is the cuntiest most agro entitled thing I\u2019ve ever heard of", "fr. plenty of dog owners want their dogs to meet other dogs. it\u2019s not fair to expect people to just assume. it\u2019s also rich that this guy is standing in front of her house, yelling at her to cross, and it\u2019s \u201cnot his problem\u201d. whose problem does he think it is, exactly? nta.", "It is. This guy is both an idiot and and asshole", "It's not even rule or no rule, it just makes basic rational sense.", "This is what I always do. I have a chihuahua and she barks a good bit. When I see someone coming with a baby or big dog or for any reason I always cross the road. Even if it is one person by themselves I do it because I know my dog can be annoying", "This is what I do! My dog is iffy with other dogs so I keep her on a short leash and don\u2019t let her get anywhere near other dogs. It\u2019s my responsibility to keep her safe and out of trouble.", "That is the rule.", "I have a small, old (17m), occasionally grumpy dog.  (He was so sweet with other dogs till he lost his vision.). I always pull him away from other dogs if they get close and I\u2019ll happily cross the street if there\u2019s not enough room.", "If only the other man hadn\u2019t been so busy flapping his gums about he would\u2019ve noticed his dog was the hyper one running about mindlessly.", "This is why I always cross the street.  But I also don't have an infant in a stroller.  I of course wouldn't have asked her to cross the street and my dog would always be on a leash.  Why, you ask do I have my dog on a leash, because I love my dog.  \n\nThat couple was, rude selfish, and does not love their pet.  \n\nOP was definitely NTA!", "I always cross the street now with my dog because he\u2019s very chill around people he knows but is skittish when it\u2019s other people/dogs he doesn\u2019t know. It\u2019s just easier to keep it separated.\n\nBut I\u2019m also 8.5 months pregnant now and once I have my son and am pushing a stroller/walking the dog I\u2019m pretty sure I won\u2019t be crossing the street more than necessary. I would assume most people would cross or at least walk in the street for the duration of my passing since it would be a tight fit with the stroller, dog, me and another person and dog lol", "Scared they might get bit, probably.", "This is already a lost cause obliviously but picking up your dog every time you see another dog or person or stroller or w/e will just make it more tense in these situations", "I mean look at the behaviour of the owner.... Where would the dog learn any kind of manners from, because you can't teach what you do not possess.", "this right here. This is intimidation and harrassment and you want it on record", "Well, the majority of *people* are assholes, so....yeah.", "Same! I've got 2 reactive dogs I walk separately and use headcollars + harnesses to keep contained. There's only 1 neighbor in my area that doesn't have an attitude about my dogs and even stopped me when I was checking the mail to let me know she'd reroute if she saw us out. She was a total sweetheart and said I should be able to take them out without extra stress.\n\nIt's so sweet and I feel bad because I know my pups would love a friend, they're just loud and dumb in public \ud83e\udd74", "My parent's Pomeranian tried to take on a moose. The moose was not concerned.", "that too.  sounds like the yippy lil thing needs a good dose of air jail anyway.", "She would be an asshole for owning a pit bull mix with 4 kids.", "You shouldn\u2019t humour these ppl OP even if he was a pitty mix it would change nothing. Only part of what that guy said that was worth paying attention to was the \u201cyou can\u2019t reason with these people\u201d and apply it to the guy saying it \ud83d\ude02 NTA both this guy and the dude in your story are wild", "Exactly, and I have a Border Collie dog that's lovely but scared of bigger dogs and doesn't get along with certain breeds so sometimes if she's acting particularly nervous about an upcoming dog, I'll cross the road. My dog's the one with the problem so I cross the road unless they do first.", "Same. I have a hound who is insane when in our neighborhood (different dog when in the downtown area) plus two other dogs. I always cross when others are coming. I grumble under my breath when people cross to my side of the street, but I still move. \n\nAnyone has the right to walk where they please. I'm the one with the issue. It's unreasonable to think my neighbors need to accommodate it.", "I've come to the conclusion that all smaller dogs are arseholes by nature.", "I came here to say that I do that with my Rat Terrier, too.

I always give people and other dogs space when walking my Scottish Terrier. But he's actually pretty nice \ud83d\ude01", "Yes. I'm surprised I didn't see this comment sooner.", "Solidarity from one reactive dog owner to another. My boy is a rescue and I don't know what he went through before he came into my life, but he carries on *a treat* when in range of another dog, wanting to get over to them, barking and jumping - only to freeze with his tail between his legs once he gets there. \n\nI go out of my way to choose walking routes that are quiet because despite his issues he still deserves exercise and the sensory stimulation of being able to wander and sniff, and have been known to double back and take a side street if we're approaching another dog. The amount of people that let their dogs go off leash and call out things like \"don't worry, he's friendly!\" is appalling! \n\nYeah, your dog might be friendly! I don't know if mine is\\*, that's why he's wearing a harness with a bright orange \"DO NOT APPROACH\" patch, and we have a bright orange leash with \"CAUTION\" printed up and down it. \n\n\\*I should mention that he's lovely with dogs and people he's familiar with, but he's basically the embodiment of \"what if we turned the concept of stranger danger up to 11 and ripped the dial off\" when out and about", "You can't reason with these people. No matter how many tragedies you link or statistics you share, they'll always choose their dangerous pets over the humans around them who are in danger, because some people want to feel like they're the special exception instead of acknowledging reality.

My Chihuahua is getting better, but he is very reactive other dogs.  It's my job to scan the environment and control how near we get to other dogs.  Sometimes that means crossing the street; other times it means picking him up.  And sometimes it means doing both.  He is considerably less reactive than he used to be, but I never expect other people to try to make things easier for him.  My job.", "OP should really see if they can charge him with trespassing, harassment, making threats, or all three.", "My dog was badly abused when she was younger, and she's afraid of men and other dogs.

I have the reactive dog; it's my responsibility to keep her safe and others safe.\n\nMy biggest fear is a friendly unleashed dog who thinks they're going to come over to my dog and make a new friend.
