My husband Mike (39M) was with our other three kids holding down the fort. My dog is a mutt and weighs around 90 pounds. His vet thinks he is a lab mix of some kind. He\u2019s the sweetest dog on the planet and so patient with my kids who are all under 7 while he\u2019s around 11 years old.\n\nWhile heading back toward my house there was a couple walking their smaller dog, a terrier of some kind I think, on the same side of the street as I am. The couple was maybe 2 to 3 houses from me at the time when they yelled \u201cCross!\u201d at me over and over. My house was between me and the couple at the time. I stopped for a second and figured they were yelling to let me know they were crossing the street so I kept with my dog and stroller towards home. I had no intention of crossing the street since I was on the same side of the street as my house and had my infant son with me.\n\nThe man became kind of aggressive with me while I kept trying to get to my house and kept yelling Cross over and over. I tried to explain that he was standing in front of my house and I wanted to get my baby home. He told me he didn\u2019t care and it wasn\u2019t his problem. About this point my husband had come outside (that\u2019s how loud this guy was) and told him to leave me alone. This guy turned to my husband and started screaming in his face. Honestly I was scared of this man. He kept going on and on about I had no manners and that since I had the bigger dog it was my responsibility to cross when coming up on others with a smaller dog. \n\nMy dog has never been aggressive with anyone or any other dogs. Like I said we have four kids under 7 and we have 2 cats. He\u2019s a sweet boy. During the entire ordeal my dog just sat down next to me and the baby. He was leashed (unlike their dog) and super calm while their little dog was running all around barking constantly. Mike told them to get off our property as the man had gotten in his face and was in our front yard to allow me, my dog and our baby to come back home. At this point my next door neighbor (who\u2019s house I had stopped in front of during the confrontation) came out as well. He basically escorted the three of us up my drive way so I could get my baby inside who had started crying with all the noise. \n\nBefore the man and his wife finally left he called me an asshole for not following \u201ccommon courtesy\u201d in crossing the street. I don\u2019t feel like I should have been expected to since I was going home and only a few houses down from my house when this all first started.", "created_utc": 1701564494, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/189hl9u/aita_for_not_crossing_the_street_with_my_dog/", "score": 940, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And their dog was off leash too, OFC.", "10000% NTA.\n1) your dog was on a leash & theirs wasn\u2019t.\n2) your dog has no issues with other dogs.\n3) you had an infant in a stroller.\n\nThe proximity to your house has NOTHING to do with it.\n\nIf their dog is the dog with problems THEY need to move, for THEIR dogs safety. \n***IF their dog went after your dog, whether they won or loss, they would be at fault. \n\nNext time you need to call the police and say there is someone with an off leash dog screaming at you and blocking you from getting to your home.", "Next time call the cops that you are afraid of the man preventing you from going into your house and that you have a baby.

That\u2019s really all there is to say- he\u2019s the irresponsible one and he\u2019s the one who should\u2019ve crossed if he was so concerned about his (unleashed) dog getting into trouble. The audacity.", "NTA. The person who is uncomfortable passing by another dog is the one who should cross. You had a dog and an infant, you should not have had to cross the street by default due to safety. They are not only entitled by expecting you to cross, but also by walking with their dog off leash.", "NTA, and also wrong. \n\n\"Common courtesy\" is that if YOU don't want to walk near someone? YOU cross the damn street. Plain and simple.", "NTA. If this happens again, scream \"LEASH!!\" until the dumbass gets the hint.", "NTA.  He didn't even have his dog on a leash and \"the people with the bigger dog cross the street\" isn't a thing anyway.", "It doesn't even matter if your house was close or not. If they have a conflictive dog, or a problem with bigger dogs, they are the ones that need to cross the street. Plus you had a stroller and they had what? Their big egos? The nerve of some people...\n\nNTA.", "NTA\nThat guy was an angry idiot. I'm glad you made it home safe", "Absolutely NTA! 2 adults with 1 small dog vs single woman with larger dog AND a 4 month old baby in a stroller? A 3 year old could figure out that the couple should cross! No other info is even necessary. That man was a major AH who still didn't even back down when he realized he was blocking you from your own home, or when your husband, and even the neighbor came out? Honestly, you should report him. He's unhinged and a menace to society. If he does that in public, wtf does he do behind closed doors???", "NTA\n\nFirst, your dog was leashed.  They were in the wrong for not leashing their dog.    \nNext, you don\u2019t always need to keep dogs away from one another.  My dog loves to meet new dogs and sniff butts.  If we get fairly close to another dog while walking, I always ask if their dog is dog friendly or if we need to detour.  Frequently, the dogs sniff one another, and then we move on.\n\nThird, he was blocking your home.  He was the one who wanted to avoid you, so it was HIs responsibility to cross to avoid you.    \nSorry you met an AH there.", "Let me get this straight. Your dog was leashed? Theirs was not?

When I see another dog, I pick Fred up fast and, if necessary, *I cross the street.*", "How exactly is screaming going to calm his unleashed  dog down? NTA.

If their dog is the reactive one, that\u2019s their problem to solve. Nothing was stopping them from crossing yet they chose to escalate the situation. They were completely out of line.", "NTA.  Anybody have cameras that caught this confrontation?", "NTA. It seems their dog takes after the owner. Yap yappity yap thinking they\u2019re king shit. Or maybe vice versa.

My real thoughts about that man would get my comment removed, but suffice to say he is 1000% in the wrong and a rude narcissist to boot. Sidewalks are for everyone, if they\u2019re uncomfortable with that then they need to stay home. My (small) dog is very friendly, but I always keep him leashed and near me and won\u2019t let him approach other people/dogs unless they\u2019re okay with it. It\u2019s that simple. If I\u2019m ever uncomfortable bringing him past someone/another dog, it would be my responsibility as a dog owner to remove both of us from the situation. The audacity of that man is astounding. I admire your family\u2019s self control because I would have reacted in a much louder and angrier manner.", "I have never heard of this \"common courtesy\" of leaving your side of the street because you have a bigger animal. WTF is that?", "100% nta. Theyre welcome to cross the street if they feel uncomfortable with their unleashed, untrained dog. It\u2019s just so rude that they expected you to get a stroller down and up another curb with a large dog to allow them to cross. Common courtesy is just moving over on the sidewalk so there\u2019s room for everyone", "NTA. This is not a common practice at all! I have a large lab mix who is 90lbs and if a man was yelling at me to \u201ccross\u201d the street while he was standing in front of my house I would have told him to F off and probably call the police.", "NTA haha what? if they do not want to be near your dog, they should move. There's no \"bigger dog\" rule. I'm sorry he screamed at you, his behavior from the start was aggressive and arrogant. \n\nMy dog does not always react well to other dogs because we have had to many run-ins with owners who do not control them. She has been jumped on and growled at by dogs passing on the sidewalk, and she's 70lb of mush. She won't hurt anyone but she will posture if she thnks they are getting too close now.  So it's MY job to remove her. If there's another dog coming our way, we pull over and sit until they pass. If there's an unleashed dog that comes up to us, I will defend us both and have no qualms about it. It's the owner's problem for not following laws and having common sense.", "Nta common courtesy is to leash your dog, which they didn't do, which you had done. Maybe and this comes down to training I don't cross the street with my dogs, they are both trained to 'sit' when I want people to pass us or 'ignore' if I need to pass people. Sounds like they have a poorly trained dog and expect everyone to accommodate them.  Because personally I would have told the guy 'my dogs are sitting you figure your own dog out'", "Nope. My dad has an extremely dog reactive 90lb pitbull. Guess who has been trained to SIT AND STAY on a short lead while the other dog goes the other direction. This works because he's in a small apartment complex, knows the neighbors with dogs, and asks nicely if it's someone who doesn't know Bubba.", "NTA\u2014A calm, well-mannered on-leash dog being walked by a person with a baby in a stroller is not obligated to cross the street.  I had a small dog who would not hurt a fly and was always on a leash, but I would pick him up and cross the street to avoid encounters with larger dogs or even other small, but clearly overly excited dogs.  Applause for your neighbor who stepped up to help you, btw.  And if anything like this happens again, call the cops and start recording the miscreants with your phone to have a record to show the police.  Unfortunately, the idiots know where you live, so you may want to invest in a security camera system and watch your dog when he\u2019s in your yard, in case the idiots try to poison him.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019d crosspost this to r/EntitledBitch, tbh", "I would have yelled back at them \"leash, leash, leash!\"", "NTA that man is deranged and a menace. They should be fined for not having their dog on a leash and it would be their fault if it got hurt. Common courtesy would be to let a woman with a stroller (or anyone) WALK TO THEIR HOUSE. If they didn\u2019t want to cross the street they could have\u2026. STOOD STILL. Good lord.", "The RULE is have your dog on a leash.  That's not only \"common courtesy\" but it's usually the LAW.\n\nNTA of course", "NTAH.  If he shows up again, remind this wanker that there are leash laws as well.", "NTA if they're afraid of your dog, *they* can cross the street.\n\nThat being said, is your dog a pit bull mix?

There is no genetic reason for Pitties to be more aggressive, they are just as domesticated as any other breed so there has to be some other reason for the behavioural issues.", "I would bet money that more children are injured (fatally or otherwise) by other children, or at the playground, than by any dog breed.\n\nSo, by your logic, we should probably should shame people for having more than one child and for taking them to playgrounds, too.", "And if there is any possibility of an issue, have your dog on a fu*king leash.", "And in my area there is a leash law so I would for sure tack that on. They don\u2019t play around with that here.", "Argue with the science, not me, lady", "This. Whilst I currently do not have a dog. I have walked many Friends dogs. And, If I'm unsure I avoid other people's dogs. But, if a Dog, is Off leash, How are you supposed to Avoid it??. I've literally had to scoop up King Charles Cavs. Because the Off Leash Dog, got Agressive.", "I hope your dog has a good time without being bothered without her comfort.\n\nThis is the main reason why I had to drill my dog full-force as she proceeds towards therapy dog certification -- she's friendly and can't understand that other dogs might not be. From the time we'd adopted her, she'd listen in any situation besides when she thought she could make friends. I've finally gotten her to the point where she'll ask to see upcoming dogs by laying down until released... but now she's automatically laying down every block or so in anticipation of getting the opportunity to play with everyone and everything she sees."]}
