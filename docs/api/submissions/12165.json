Just was awkwardly throw in last second.\n\nYTA. You mentioned you don\u2019t even know what the conversation was about.

And the parent who wanted to continue to ignore the toddler\u2019s excitement and pride (and sounds like the child altogether) was in the right because he was talking to family? He was sacrificing the feelings and growth of his child who is too young to understand, to coddle adults who could easily rationalize pausing a conversation for 5 minutes. Yes, a child needs to learn to function in society but not at the expense of them feeling safe and loved in their own home by family. No wonder she\u2019s shy (scared) around them! And why is it only OPs responsibility to watch the child? Dragging it out 3 days is too much but it sounds like her feelings were never validated and therefore difficult to let go of. If someone gets angry and chastises me for wanting them to witness a step forward in their child\u2019s growth and then dismisses my feelings, that makes them an asshole. It was a lovely moment spoiled by dad\u2019s priorities. Hopefully there will be a man in her life that doesn\u2019t get his panties in a wad when he has to pay attention to her.", "I'd say YTA for trying to shame him into compliance by stating he has a 'cold heart' and now continuing to carry on the manipulation attempt by sulking.\n\nNeither sound like adult communication tactics if I'm honest.", "YTA - interrupting conversations is rude", "ESH.\n\nIf he doesn't usually brush you or your daughter off, then why didn't you at least figure out what the conversation was about before insisting?\n\nAnd yes, he should have been enthusiastic and supportive. He should understand your point of view, and he should give your words weight. Especially if you spend more time with your daughter and understand her moods better.", "Esh. I get what you are saying but demanding he immediately stop his conversation to watch is not great. Instead you could have managed your daughter\u2019s expectations as well as asking your husband his availability. \u201cDaughter would like you to come see her dance!

You're 100% right that his daughter should be the most important person in his life, except if he has other children. Any father who disagreed should never have become a father. The fact that he doesn't see it that way is very concerning in my opinion. The fact that he dismisses your anger and concerns so easily and seems to have a complete lack of empathy is another one.

He was just talking with his family who were staying for dinner according to OPs comment, and even though it depends on how she asked and if the conversation was very heavy, the normal response of a loving dad would have been to be excited about her daughter sharing her first dance with him and his family.

I'm sure others have pointed this out, but you're basically teaching your daughter that it's okay to interrupt people who are busy just to get your own way. Your daughter is at an age where she's going to look at the behaviour that's being modelled and imitate that behaviour. Think about that. \nAlso, the fact that you told your husband that your daughter should be the priority etc is nothing more than a guit-trip and I'm glad he called you out on it.

You don't think that's a little childish?", "Actually it's rude unless it's an absolute emergency to interrupt someone.

They come up with a system where she grabs her dad's arm, and he puts his hand over hers to acknowledge her, so he can address her at an appropriate break in the conversation.", "I think it\u2019s reasonable to tell a three year old she has to wait until daddy is off the phone.

There is no reason to suggest that when you know absolutely nothing about this family.", "Oh for goodness sake OP has already stated the 3 year old doesn't like showing anyone \n\nSome three year olds are shy and toddlers are bloody stubborn \n\nYou haven't been around many kids if your first thought is \"red flag, that kid doesn't want to act like a show pony\"", "Not really. A tap on their shoulder or something is on e thing but to completely interrupt and expect someone to completely change what they're doing isn't ok.", "You can absolutely start to teach 3 year olds that they need to wait sometimes and can't always interrupt people. This is a pretty common thing they learn in preschool.", "3 year olds may not fully understand the whys, but they are capable of waiting. You can teach toddlers to start practicing patience and not everything is \u201cright now\u201d", "Absolutely. There are supportive ways to respond to a young child that both acknowledge their presence and clearly show that you're busy and they'll have to wait a moment.", "It\u2019s typically more feasible to redirect a toddler rather than teach them to be patient. It\u2019s why the terrible two\u2019s (and three\u2019s) are even a thing. They don\u2019t have the reasoning skills to understand patience and their worldview is very immediate. I think that\u2019s what OP is referring to when she says that she pulled her husband away from his family because she wasn\u2019t sure that her toddler would do the dance later."]}
