Would be different story if the dad watched it with a grumpy face but no he didnt so there is no way he is an ass for asking to not be interrupted rudely like thats again.", "Ikr ??? Like how important could this conversation really have been for a five minute delay to ruin it", "Ummmmm\u2026..who said she didn\u2019t politely ask him for a minute so he could watch? That still qualifies as an interruption, no?", "Well said", "Could be read that he thinks the accusation itself is ridiculous because it\u2019s patently untrue. OP is milking it a bit.", "We never hear that he disagreed with the statement. We heard that he thinks OP is ridiculous, which holding a grudge over this conversation for several days and then showing it off to the internet kind of supports. For all we know, he thinks she ridiculous for saying that his daughter isn\u2019t the most important person to him.", "But that\u2019s basically what he did. He just wanted an appropriate time to do that instead of teaching the kid that interrupting any other thing to focus only on them. It\u2019s raising a child with proper manners in mind while also giving them the appropriate response as Op said he did\n\nYes, loving your child and cheering them on is especially important. But keep in mind that you don\u2019t want to raise them to be people who don\u2019t take others into consideration. There\u2019s another comment here where a parent made that mistake with their child", "They were family. One hopes they thought the child was cute.", "It does matter to an extent because if they\u2019re just shooting the shit about the Yankees then that could\u2019ve waited a few minutes", "So if a special moment is happening with your child, but you\u2019re in the middle of a conversation, your SO should just not tell you? You\u2019d rather just miss the moment? OP said if she waited, the chance might have been gone.", "Appropriate time? Dude wasn't curing cancer. He was bsing with family.", "Bluey is the best kids show ever made and nothing will ever change my mind. Have you watched the duck cake episode? Tears. Every time.", "My mom came up with the same thing back 25+ years ago, she called it the interrupt rule. I could put my hand on her arm (and therefore focus on what I wanted to tell/ask her), she knew I wanted to talk to her (and therefore could look for an opening in the conversation), and whoever she was talking to didn't get interrupted.", "Oh my fucking god.\n\nA child being a bit iffy with one of their parents when they\u2019re fucking 3 isn\u2019t a red flag. It\u2019s a toddler.\n\nWake up to yourself.", "At 3 my sister was literally scared of everything from birds to dogs and literally cried the first time she had to participate in a school play as a kid. My parents were advised to get her into an extra curricular dance class to boost her confidence and ability to be in crowds. At 19 now she is one of the most confident people I know and still loves to dance at University. Her initial shyness and stage fright had nothing to do with abuse. Some people just need help to gain confidence", "Sharing with dad is not acting as a show pony. Not wanting to share with the rest of the family is very normal.", "And you're assuming she's being sad for days over him saying don't interrupt my conversations. As I said at the beginning there's a lot if info missing and you're all siding with him without even considering that it is very possible that there's a bigger issue going on here.", "> And you\u2019re assuming she\u2019s being sad for days over him saying don\u2019t interrupt my conversations \n\nIt\u2019s not an assumption it\u2019s the premise of the post\n\nEdit: premise is the wrong word to use I meant to say ending", "I have a child that only shows me things also and NEVER shows anyone else. NTA, if this can build their confidence and show that their father has the confidence and adoration in them it really matters.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nA three year old wanted to show her dad her dance. I bet the family probably thought it was cute. I feel bad for your daughter OP. Your husband DOES have a cold heart if he thinks you\u2019re being ridiculous for saying your daughter should be the most important thing in his life. She should be the most important thing in his life. Certainly enough to take five minutes to watch her dance.", "NTA. If the 3yo is shy, you pay attention when they actively seek it out. As they grow older, you teach them the manners. You\u2019re encouraging them to do the opposite of their nature. \n\nIf it\u2019s a constant occurs because they\u2019re NOT shy, that\u2019s when you work on not interruption when they\u2019re that young. Again, You\u2019re encouraging them to do the opposite of their nature. \n\nIt\u2019s all about encouraging the appropriate middle ground - the outgoing learn to rein it in as appropriate and the shy learn to interrupt some of the time.", "Heyy look at all the people with no children, having so much to say. That\u2019s cute. NTA by the way.", "I think it was fine to interrupt your husband and I think it\u2019s fine that was not happy about it. You\u2019re not going to agree on everything. I do think you should not continue to be upset over it. It\u2019s time to kiss and make up.", "YTA... Your husband did what you asked and didn't embarrass you in front of the family, he let you know he thought it was rude in private afterwards and you are complaining that he has an opinion. He respected you enough to watch the 3yo \"dance\" and not say anything in front of everyone, but that's not good enough... He can't even let you know privately that what you did was rude.", "NTA. Has your husband heard of the song \u201cCat\u2019s in the Cradle\u201d?", "My SO and I don\u2019t even have kids yet. However, I\u2019ll bet everything I have that if I interrupted any conversation he was having to say our child wanted to show him a dance that she was too shy to show him before he\u2019d immediately stop talking to watch. NTA and I\u2019d be as pissed as you are if he reacted like your husband.", "NTA- kids can be moody especially toddlers- it\u2019s on parents to accommodate small requests. And he was talking to his parents- who will understand and be ok with postponing their interaction- a 3 yr old child or 60-70yr old man/woman. Next time record the dance and send him the video, if he asks why dint u call- tell you did not want to interrupt", "Right?? My 19 year old son will interrupt me fairly regularly to info dump about cars and or video games. Do I give a shit about either of those topics? Nope. But I will listen carefully because I friggin love this kid. \n(I do chat with him about being considerate of other people's time, and encourage him to ask rather than interrupt people, but he's really comfortable with me and sometimes forgets social conventions)\n\nIt should be exciting to watch your toddler kid showing off skills they have learned. In a couple of decades he will wonder why his daughter doesn't share any information about her life with him anymore.", "He wasn't irritated that she wanted to show her \"dance\", he was irritated that he was interrupted in the middle of a conversation with guests to watch his daughter flail around (like hes probably seen 100 times and will probably see many more times.)", "His daughter, his child, his baby. Not \u201cyour daughter\u201d. It\u2019s not the neighbor\u2019s kid putting on a show for the 12th time. It\u2019s his little girl wanting to show her father a dance. To make him proud and show her love and joy. These are the moments that shape a person\u2019s life. The moments and feelings that are remembered. One day that joyful smile and eyes full of innocent love will go away if he\u2019s not careful and it won\u2019t come back.", "Did I miss where OP said the conversation was serious? Or where she said she jumped into the middle of the group and dragged him away without explanation? I\u2019m confused as to why going up to your husband at a family gathering, excusing yourself and telling him his daughter wants to show him a special dance is considered such a rude behavior. This was a family gathering not a business meeting. Is his wife supposed to stand 3 feet behind him until he addresses her? If he addresses her at all.", "Heck, I did that for a kid I didn't know at an outdoor event I went to last weekend. Because, you know what, they're kids!\n\nHow any parent could treat their kid like that breaks my heart. \n\nOP is NTA", "Exactly man. I\u2019m on the spectrum and as a kid would interrupt my mom to explain the entire plot of a SpongeBob episode or ask her opinion on my artwork in the middle of a phone call. When I was old enough to conceptualize it, she told me I needed to be patient and hold onto my thoughts while other people are busy. She always gave me the time of day when she could though. If she had just brushed me off, I imagine I would have grown up far less comfortable sharing serious stuff with her.\n\nETA: and even with that, my parents will still pause to talk to/check in on me if I need. If the kid had screamed bloody murder or started sobbing, would the dad have asked them to wait until the convo was over?", "Glad your mom encouraged you while also helping you navigate social expectations! \nSpongebob is the best, might have to watch some with my son for the nostalgia", "Not really, no. I mean, you do actively teach them this stuff, but it doesn't connect till the brain is ready for the connection to happen. Meanwhile, you have to choose what you can and can't teach delays for. Kids that young also deflate easily, and lose their enthusiasm for doing something in a heartbeat. I learnt the hard way that are are absolutely things I should drop everything for so I can foster a growing skill. And I should do it multiple times. \nThere absolutely are things where a child can be taught to wait. Showing off a skill that they have no real confidence of their own in yet is not one of them.", "Yes and no. Regardless of what people are talking about, interrupting them is rude. \n\nWhile I understand your point, you also don\u2019t want to set the precedent that it\u2019s okay to interrupt others.", "Wow, are you always this pessimistic?", "Doing tricks on demand is a show pony"]}
