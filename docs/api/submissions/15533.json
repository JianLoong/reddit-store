We don\u2019t know what the circumstances were. Was she pressured into having them, did she get ppd after the birth, was a closed adoption an option,etc? \n\nBeing able to birth a child doesn\u2019t automatically make you maternal and it doesn\u2019t seem right to vilify that. \n\nThis situation is obviously messed up, but there\u2019s a lot of missing info of how this family got to this point.", "She doesn't.
