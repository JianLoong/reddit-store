{"id": 27636, "submission_id": "16sasg2", "title": "AITA for telling someone that not everyone likes eating salads like them", "selftext": "Last weekend me, my boyfriend, my friends and two of his friends went on this weekend getaway to this beautiful beach town. We had concerts lined up and rented out a huge bungalow and that's why we bought so many people with us. Me and my friends are all 21. My bf and his friends are in their mid 20s byw. \n\nNow my bf has this friend P who is a holistic nutritional coach. There were two incidents that muddled up the waters this weekend and both of them happened at the dining table.\n\n1. P was helping my bf lose weight. She went on and on about cutting out sugar completely and was judgemental over every single food item he was having. She made an open ended statement at the table \"I think it's better if sugar didn't exist at all. All these junk didn't exist at all\". I told her to chill and a little bit of this and that isn't gonna kill anybody or affect anyone's weight loss journey. She disagreed vehemently but then I stated that I also lost 40lbs recently and I didn't do restrictive dieting. I ate everything. I ate mindfully. I worked out consistently. I don't hate my life. I don't hate the food I ate. But she said I don't know what I was talking about and discouraging everyone. I shrugged it off because I didn't want to argue anymore. People who have a problem with over eating are going to snap and gain back all weight in strict diets and I don't encourage it really. \n\n2. We were having dinner. I have this friend J who is the type of girl who eats whatever she wants and still stays thin. We had ordered briyani that night. I always have a small appetite so I tend to split briyani into two. But J was the opp of me. She can have a whole briyani by herself and eat some more. Anyways P interrupts J while she is devouring her briyani and tells her that she shouldn't over eat like that, it's unhealthy. J is the non confrontational type but I could see how J had become upset after that comment. To break the tension, I said something like \"haha it's okay, we go to the gym 6 days a week and break our back. Let her have one night with her old lover\"  P once again told us \"yeah but she should be more aware of what she is putting inside her body. That is a ridiculous amount of food etc etc etc and went on and on about it\". I snapped and said \"comon P, we are on a vacation, not everyone wants to eat salads like you. Some of us just want to have fun\". But then P once again stated that J shouldn't be like this be like that. I told her that I think it's inappropriate she should comment on J's eating habits. She refuted that she did the same with my boyfriend and I told her well he's your friend and idk what kind of dynamic you share, but you just met us so I think it's rude to make assessments like that. I think you should apologize to J.   \n\nP was really upset after that and started crying to her friend. My bf thinks I should have just let it slide as she only had good intentions but my friends think she deserved it. It felt like having a therapist with is who was constantly psychoanalyses us. It was tiring. There were other incidents where she made subtle comments about food as well btw.", "created_utc": 1695693328, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16sasg2/aita_for_telling_someone_that_not_everyone_likes/", "score": 173, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Saying something once in a non judgemental tone is ok. To continue is rude and pedantic. I was going to have a salad for dinner, I think I will order a patty melt and a vanilla shake instead in honor of P. NTA.\n\nETA\nMy lazy butt waited too late to order the patty melt. I am going to add bacon, a few slices of ribeye steak, some cheese and smother it in a generous dollop of the most fat laden dressing to the salad I planned eating at first. Its a salad, right? Malicious compliance. - lifts a fork to P-", "\"P\" doesn't sound like a very good nutritional coach if they don't realize that some sugars exist in almost all foods we consume.\n\nId have told \"P\" I didn't even want her around.

WTH is wrong with her?? You're NTA", "NTA.  Having good intentions doesn\u2019t excuse bad behavior.  The road to hell, etc.  What if J was someone who struggled with an eating disorder?  P had no way to know whether she might be, and that kind of judgmental diatribe can be extremely harmful to someone dealing with eating disorders.", "Eating disorder survivor here.\n\nP speaks like they have an eating disorder. That being said that is absolutely no excuse to treat other people like this and actively contribute to the incidence or this disease.\n\nYou are NTA. In fact, in recovery we're taught about intuitive eating. And how one day is never going to change the way you look. We're taught to avoid the cycle of shame and guilt and be OK with having days where we eat whatever the hell we want.\n\nYou are doing the right thing. People like P make me so fing mad though.", "NTA - P was definitely over stepping, if she gives unsolicited advice she should expect unsolicited feedback.", "NTA, its not P's place to tell J how to eat, unless J asked P for help, which it doesn't seem they did. Its well and good to want to eat healthy yourself, but its annoying when someone tells people they should follow their eating habits when they didn't ask", "By letting it 'slide' the boyfriend was implying that the OP should have just allowed P to bully and shame J about her food.  P was overstepping and absolutely deserved to be shut down.\n\nNTA", "NTA and frankly if your bf approves of this behavior remind him that THE INSTANT his \"Friend\" triggers someones eating disorder that it will be on BOTH of them her for acting this way and him for encouraging this behavior.  She doesn't know what people are going through or what their life has been and since she finds it acceptable to do this to random people she has NEVER met then there is a 100% chance she will eventually do it to someone who is trying to get over an issue and trigger a relapse.", "NTA - P is a health nut that needs to mind they're own business instead of being a health food dictator", "Nta.\nThis person sounds like a total pita. You don't get to police other people's food choices.", "NTA - P is a real kill joy. She's very rude for policing other guests' eating habits. Soon, she won't be invited anywhere.", "NTA.\n\nP sounds like one of those people who makes her opinion on one subject the sum total of her personality. Maybe it's how many eating fads I've seen come and go over the years, but honestly, your way of eating is probably healthier and more sustainable long-term than whatever P's advocating.", "NTA. Every nutritionist I know (people with degrees who actually know what they are talking about) would say that P is not only full of shit, but that her ideas are dangerous and unhealthy.", "NTA\n\nP is being overbearing and needs to take a hint.", "NTA.  I would either refuse to share a table with her or come to the table with nacho sauce and add another spoon to my plate every time she doubled down.  Unless someone has confused arsenic and coffee creamer, people need to keep unsolicited dietary feedback to themselves.\n\nEdited to remove duplicated word.", "NTA she didn't have good intentions. She just sat around the table and judged everyone for what they were eating. I believe her intent was to put herself above people who don't eat exactly like her.", "P needs to be put in corner to rage eat an almond \n\nIf I were the girlfriend I would have door dashed the best Indian restaurant to have a samosa chaat delivered to me", "Nta\n\nWhat people eat is none of your business unless you're a paid professional working with a client.

A lot of eating disorders begin because they are shamed/controlled/pressured to eat or look a certain way. \n\nYour bf friend, P, needs to be reminded that sugar and fats exists in all foods naturally (fruits, vegetables, etc.). So don\u2019t know how she eats since she is against sugar. \n\nAlso everyone is different when it comes to nutritional and caloric needs. Like your friend, J, she might/need to eat high caloric meals to maintain her caloric/nutritional needs due to a fast metabolism which can be caused by exercise, medical condition, or naturally. \n\nIf P was concerned or genuine she wouldn\u2019t be ranting and raving about how it\u2019s ridiculous that J is eating such foods. Also who gives advice or critiques about the eating habits/food consumption of someone that they don\u2019t know?  \n\nAgain NTA, P needed to get a reality check and be put into her place. P faced the consequences of giving unwanted advice. P is just upset that you didn\u2019t take/endure and sided with her bs like everyone else.", "I suggest disinviting whoever invited her next time", "i bet P is a vegan.", "So judgy on holiday.
