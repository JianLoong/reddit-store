We had concerts lined up and rented out a huge bungalow and that's why we bought so many people with us. Me and my friends are all 21. My bf and his friends are in their mid 20s byw. \n\nNow my bf has this friend P who is a holistic nutritional coach. There were two incidents that muddled up the waters this weekend and both of them happened at the dining table.\n\n1. P was helping my bf lose weight. She went on and on about cutting out sugar completely and was judgemental over every single food item he was having. She made an open ended statement at the table \"I think it's better if sugar didn't exist at all. All these junk didn't exist at all\". I told her to chill and a little bit of this and that isn't gonna kill anybody or affect anyone's weight loss journey. She disagreed vehemently but then I stated that I also lost 40lbs recently and I didn't do restrictive dieting. I ate everything. I ate mindfully. I worked out consistently. I don't hate my life. I don't hate the food I ate. But she said I don't know what I was talking about and discouraging everyone. I shrugged it off because I didn't want to argue anymore. People who have a problem with over eating are going to snap and gain back all weight in strict diets and I don't encourage it really. \n\n2. We were having dinner. I have this friend J who is the type of girl who eats whatever she wants and still stays thin. We had ordered briyani that night. I always have a small appetite so I tend to split briyani into two. But J was the opp of me. She can have a whole briyani by herself and eat some more. Anyways P interrupts J while she is devouring her briyani and tells her that she shouldn't over eat like that, it's unhealthy. J is the non confrontational type but I could see how J had become upset after that comment. To break the tension, I said something like \"haha it's okay, we go to the gym 6 days a week and break our back. Let her have one night with her old lover\"  P once again told us \"yeah but she should be more aware of what she is putting inside her body. That is a ridiculous amount of food etc etc etc and went on and on about it\". I snapped and said \"comon P, we are on a vacation, not everyone wants to eat salads like you. Some of us just want to have fun\". But then P once again stated that J shouldn't be like this be like that. I told her that I think it's inappropriate she should comment on J's eating habits. She refuted that she did the same with my boyfriend and I told her well he's your friend and idk what kind of dynamic you share, but you just met us so I think it's rude to make assessments like that. I think you should apologize to J.   \n\nP was really upset after that and started crying to her friend. My bf thinks I should have just let it slide as she only had good intentions but my friends think she deserved it. It felt like having a therapist with is who was constantly psychoanalyses us. It was tiring. There were other incidents where she made subtle comments about food as well btw.", "created_utc": 1695693328, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16sasg2/aita_for_telling_someone_that_not_everyone_likes/", "score": 508, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, she needs to mind her damn business and keep her mouth shut because she is going to cause people to develop really unhealthy habits with food.

Good on you for standing up to her and sticking up for your friend!", "Sounds like P was bringing her work self to a casual social setting, which is often not appropriate.

You can\u2019t monitor and judge others based on your own eating habits and what you may believe to be right. Even if she claimed she was a nutritionist, none of you are her clients. \n\nNot to mention what she said about sugar. Our bodies need sugar. It doesn\u2019t have to be processed, but lots of foods like fruit have natural sugars that we need to function. \n\nOP you definitely are not in the wrong, especially because the whole confrontation was started by P and you were only trying to deescalate and change the subject. If P was really that concerned for you guys, she should have brought it up after dinner, in a way that wasn\u2019t attacking your food choices and eating habits", "NTA. P sounds absolutely insufferable.\n\nI would have taken a huge scoop of biryani, leaned right into her face, and shoved the biryani in my mouth.\n\nSeriously people like that need to mind their damn business and stop getting their health information from Goop.", "NTA.\n\nP's approach to nutrion will make people develop  eating disorders. Restrictive diets are often bad for your physical and your mental health. \n\nLooking out for healthy food, non-processed food without huge amounts of sugar and salt, I am all for it.\n\nBut eating should never be a chore and a diet shouldn't make people miserable. \n\nMany people can lose weight by cutting off processed food and sweets, smaller food portions, with more vegetables and less meat. Plus a more active lifestyle with gym or walking, biking, using stairs instead of elevators.\n\nAnd a small treat like a favourite meal or a small piece of chocolate or dessert is more helpful in the long run.", "Exactly my thought.

I'm not bashing people who eat healthy or eat junk food but I am against people like P who basically critics people on everything they eat. \n\nO p you are NTA and your boyfriend should open up his eyes and realize that not everyone wants to be policed and critique about their eating habits or weight every single moment of the day", "I don't think p should have said anything!

This is her thing and her only thing.   Calling herself a coach without understanding what the word means.   You only get to coach people that willingly engage with you for your coaching.", "Sounds like she's just a person with a very unhealthy relationship with food who copes by telling herself that she's the only one who has it right and managed to turn that into a profession. \n\nAlways suspicious of anyone who subscribes to foods as having moral value - \"sugar is evil, junk food is bad, salads are pure\" etc.  Food is food, guilt is not an ingredient in any of it.", "You don\u2019t need to eat glucose, your body is able to create glucose through Gluconeogenesis in the liver and kidney", "[removed]", "[removed]", "All those types of people are good for is causing eating disorders.

Just reading about P was mentally exhausting, I can't imagine OP putting up with someone like that. Good on OP for snapping, which I feel should've been sooner.

I don't think in general anyone should offer unsolicited advice.

But they're chemicals, just like any medication, and there are safe dosages, safe routes of administration, and potential side effects and interactions.\n\nIt's like people hear the word 'natural' and all sense flies out of their heads \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
