Babies throw up alot. And are you telling me she left your child with you while you were sick?", "She left you WITH a toddler while you were super sick?

I'm doubting this kid has never spit up or fully vomited.\n\nIf your wife is currently in treatment for this aversion, then she should follow the strategies of her counselor---and I don't think that would be \"Leave the house for a week if someone is ill.\"\n\nIf she is not currently in treatment then she needs to be.

Imagine you being on a business trip and your kid gets sick.", "From the information given I would say NTA. The fact she left the child when the child wasn't sick is not okay at all. Especially if you're so sick to the point that it's been days.

And what was she doing at her mother's that meant that she couldn't have her child there? But most importantly, given that you clearly had a stomach virus of some sort (food poisoning wouldn't have lasted this long), why would she leave a HEALTHY toddler in the house with you when you were violently ill and likely contagious, while she left? Is she usually so irresponsible or indifferent to your child's health and welfare?", "NTA and I can\u2019t believe she left the kid with you when you were sick! Wow nice mom.", "NTA but your wife definitely is! How the hell did she manage to have a baby? They throw up.

She needs therapy and you need a partner who doesn't dissappear at the sign of vomit, especially with a child in the house.", "NTA \n\nI think there's other issues here at play, tbh. It goes deeper than her fear. This is something you both need to sit down and talk about honestly.

It does sound as if she needs some sort of intensive counseling, especially since the two of you have a child.  Kids throw up all of the time.  If she refuses, I would take a hard look at my marriage if I were you.", "NTA - she can leave you (not very caring but you are an adult) but how can she leave your while sick WITH THE CHILD - and how can her own mother enable that?

If her phobia is that bad, why hasn\u2019t she gotten treatment for it, if only for the sake of your child? And , despite her phobia, has she even checked up on you to see how you are doing?

Anything smaller? Not happening, so I get how bad phobias can be.\n\n\nI'd ask her to come grab the kid, but until you are no longer vomiting, you shouldn't ask her to come back.", "NTA. OP, what happens if you or your child gets a chronic illness that involves nausea? Does she just never come home? The fact that therapy is just too hard for her to even consider is my problem here. Three years is a long time to have a child and expect to disappear every time a stomach virus comes along. Now, I can be petty when it comes to making serious points, but I would be tempted to just continue to tell her either I or the baby were sick until she got fucking tired of staying at her mom\u2019s and got some therapy, or admitted that her family just wasn\u2019t important enough to make an effort for and started divorce proceedings.

It's an entirely involuntary physical reaction that I don't think there's a fix for.\n\nI also have a toddler. Toddlers get sick. They bring bugs into the house. The thing that made me saddest last time he was ill wasn't that I was throwing up, it's how useless I was while he was actively throwing up and could only be of help in-between because I had to either leave the room and be out of ear shot or I was just throwing up with him which doesn't give much room for being soothing. \n\nI am *furious* with your wife.

Fight or flight would kick in and I would remove myself from the situation, no matter what it was. It consumed my every day, the fear of both being sick and seeing sick so I can understand why she fled.\n\nHowever, this is something that she needs help with, and only she can take that step. I've had CBT, read the books, done the exposure etc. It is HARD. The exposure was awful, but it works. I always say I'm a recovering emetophobic because I think its something I'll always have, but I can cope with it a lot better now.

My partner came down with a horrible stomach bug a few months ago and couldn\u2019t be left in any room without a bucket beside him. Somehow, someway, I managed to sit and comfort him every time he was sick and even empty out that nasty bucket. It was like in those moments, my fight or flight kicked in and my brain actually went \u201cYou love him so much. You have to fight.\u201d Trust me, I shook with anxiety the whole time but you do tough things for those you deeply care for.\nI really hope your wife is able to work through her fears and be able to support you & your little one in these moments in the future!", "Nah, dont ask her to come home. Let her stay with mama since that's her obvious level of immaturity. Parenting a child with someone this self-centered will be a nightmare. Spare yourself and your child the pain and move on. Find someone who takes the whole sickness and health bit seriously.", "Wow you're focusing on the wrong issue here. Your wife just left you at the drop of a hat when you developed an illness that could've potentially left you severely dehydrated and even led to death. That sounds crazy to me. I get the phobia but I can't even imagine leaving my husband (even without the toddler element) alone in a situation like that. I'd have stayed at least to make him juices etc and make sure that he was staying properly hydrated.", "NTA but your wife is.

You could not have communicated it to your child and both gotten sick to the point of needing hospitalization or even dying. \n\nIn September 2021, my middle daughter's so called best friend who was WELL aware of her T1 Diabetes and the implications of illnesses that cause vomiting and or diarrhea claimed this same phobia and left my daughter in a coma and a pool of vomitted up bile on their bedroom floor in college (literally three weeks into their first, freshman semester). My daughter had gotten sick 48 hours before after this same 'friend' made some other shady decisions that also impacted my daughter. When I called for the welfare check because I felt something was off, my daughter was literally less than 10-15 minutes from death with a core temp of 85. She spent almost a week in a coma and I spent the remainder of 2021and most of 2022 literally fighting for her life on a daily basis due to the damage done. Every one of her heart valves is now damaged. She has minor brain damage impacting her short-term memory. She went legally blind due to her blood glucose being so incredibly high when she was found and some of the life saving treatments causing cataracts (she just had her first surgery and now has vision in one eye again). This is not to mention the mental health impact because my daughter not only was left to die by and lost her best friend, but because that person and the other two roommates harassed my daughter, verbally attacked her and then told many lies to insure she was cut off from the entirety of her social support network.\n\nRegardless of your wife's phobia, her response is incredibly selfish, uncaring, and dangerous/deadly. I would reconsider even having her back in the home at this point. If her phobia is so severe she would risk two lives like that and then gaslight you into it being your problem, then she should perhaps not be in the marriage or you know get some freaking mental health help. \n\nI'm sorry, I don't normally go off on rants like this, but I know the potential impact of her actions all too well and the pain of almost losing my daughter obviously wrote deeply on me. Those two had been friends since around second grade, and solid best friends since at least seventh. At her request, I had personally taught the friend everything about T1D and what to do in various situations, including such as what actually happened. In previous circumstances, this same friend had called me when she was concerned about my daughter's health in the moment, but she had changed a lot their senior year. There's a ton more to this story, obviously, and my daughter is no saint, but if the situation had been reversed and the friend were laying there in a pool of blood (daughter has a terrible phobia of blood and also of anything medical, to the point of it causing psuedoseizures in the past), my daughter would have stayed and moved heaven and earth to help her friend. I see what your wife did here as quite equivalent to what was done to my daughter, and it is absolutely unacceptable for any reason.", "NTA.

Forget all the phobia but to leave someone sick and feeling terrible AND have to take care of a young child for FIVE days is horrible. This goes beyond her phobia, this is selfishness and a lack of compassion. She just left, she didn't try to bridge the gap of helping you and your child while dealing with her phobia.

Would she run out the door, leaving the child alone, and sick until you got there to care for your child?  Would she force your child to suffer being sick alone so your wife didn't see her getting sick then bail as soon as you got home?  This situation, while infreguent, is not good, at all.  If your wife is refusing therapy of any kind to deal with her phobia, you're going to have a bigger, potentially more dangerous issue in the future if your child is the one who gets sick under mom's watch.", "Does your wife do other things to indicate she is only there in the good times?

Ditching you with the kid for five days and then getting hostile about coming home seems to indicate a bigger problem.

Personally, I would not stay with someone who is this self involved and insistant on enabling their own mental illness. \n\nPhobias can be hard, but a good partner and parent will work on it and get over it enough to function like a decent fucking human being.  I try to avoid giving people advice to break up or reevaluate their relationship, but this one situation says a lot about who she is as a person. Your kid will be affected by this.

Let her know that her reactions could negatively affect your child and pass on phobias to them.  She may also need medication.

The beauty is that you can tailor the education to the child and make sure your child has a good grasp of the information before moving on. Many schools in the US push kids through without ensuring they\u2019ve grasped the information much less mastered it. Different states have different regulations and many require either a year end test or review with a certified teacher. \n\nMy kids are still young so some subjects like history and science are interest led while math and language arts are more structured. This school year is when I plan on making science and history more formal as he\u2019ll be in third grade. For example my son(8) is a huge history buff. He\u2019s recently gotten into wanting to learn about military and war history. We\u2019ve done units on the civil war and revolutionary war. For the civil war we read a book on the Battle of Gettysburg. A major battle in the war and the reason the north won the war. We were on vacation at the time so while driving home we made a special side trip to take him to see the battlefield. While there we did a guided tour of the battlefield and learned even more about significant events within that particular battle. \n\nWhile we were on vacation we took our kids to museums and did dives into the natural and social history of the area we were in. Since he\u2019s still young we don\u2019t go super deep into things as that can get above his head but he\u2019s getting a good baseline for further learning later. For science we\u2019ve done things like weather studies then visited a nearby weather research station, we\u2019ve studied dinosaurs and then taken them to museums dedicated to dinosaurs, etc. \n\nMy son struggles with language arts though. He\u2019s super smart but he doesn\u2019t enjoy it because it doesn\u2019t come as easily as other skills. So we\u2019ve been able to really dig deep on an individual level to help him figure out how he best learns this subject so he can master the skills. Instead of just moving him though before he ready to move on I\u2019m able to spend as much time as he needs on it until we feel comfortable with moving on. In many public schools it\u2019s hard to get that kind of individual attention for kids  because they have to cater to the whole and if you live in a more rural area many services aren\u2019t available. \n\nWe also do co-op so he gets to meet with other homeschooled kids weekly for more structured learning. He does summer camp for two weeks every summer, municipal sports in our town, we get together with friends often, and I will sign him up for supplemental classes like art classes as they come available. Music lessons on are deck for him soon as well. Homeschooling has been really positive for us. When my husband\u2019s grandfather was dealing with health issues we were able to go be with him often and that gave us more time with him than we would\u2019ve had if he was in public or private school. I live 1,000 miles away from my family so being able to take a few weeks to go visit them during the quiet time of year means there\u2019s no break in his schooling and we don\u2019t have to tailor our schedule strictly to the school schedule. We can also take time off when we want because we choose to school year round so we don\u2019t wind up with gaps in learning.", "Wow. That's so interesting!
