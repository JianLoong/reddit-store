Babies throw up alot. And are you telling me she left your child with you while you were sick?", "She left you WITH a toddler while you were super sick? Phobia or no phobia, your wife is a jerk.", "NTA, and you've been accommodating this during the 3 years you've had a child? I'm doubting this kid has never spit up or fully vomited.\n\nIf your wife is currently in treatment for this aversion, then she should follow the strategies of her counselor---and I don't think that would be \"Leave the house for a week if someone is ill.\"\n\nIf she is not currently in treatment then she needs to be.  This is aggravating to a spouse, but an untenable situation for a parent.", "NTA. \n\nEven if she got the most insane case of emetophobia, she is also a mother and wife. Het priorities are messed up. Imagine you being on a business trip and your kid gets sick.", "From the information given I would say NTA. The fact she left the child when the child wasn't sick is not okay at all. Especially if you're so sick to the point that it's been days. I get she has a phobia so her leaving cause she's absolutely terrified is fine but to abandon her child when they are perfectly fine is fucked up.", "NTA.

And what was she doing at her mother's that meant that she couldn't have her child there? But most importantly, given that you clearly had a stomach virus of some sort (food poisoning wouldn't have lasted this long), why would she leave a HEALTHY toddler in the house with you when you were violently ill and likely contagious, while she left? Is she usually so irresponsible or indifferent to your child's health and welfare?", "NTA and I can\u2019t believe she left the kid with you when you were sick! Wow nice mom.", "NTA but your wife definitely is! How the hell did she manage to have a baby? They throw up.

She shouldn't have become a mother if her phobia is so out of control she has to abandon her family for days at a time.\n\nThis should have been addressed a long time ago. She needs therapy and you need a partner who doesn't dissappear at the sign of vomit, especially with a child in the house.", "NTA \n\nI think there's other issues here at play, tbh. It goes deeper than her fear. This is something you both need to sit down and talk about honestly.

It does sound as if she needs some sort of intensive counseling, especially since the two of you have a child.  Kids throw up all of the time.  If she refuses, I would take a hard look at my marriage if I were you.", "NTA - she can leave you (not very caring but you are an adult) but how can she leave your while sick WITH THE CHILD - and how can her own mother enable that?

If her phobia is that bad, why hasn\u2019t she gotten treatment for it, if only for the sake of your child? And , despite her phobia, has she even checked up on you to see how you are doing?

If you never talked about it and had kids without her considering this then she is the A H. Regardless, if she is not in therapy for this then she is the A H.. she should at least be taking steps to get better so she can potentially be there if really needed. \nI hope you feel better soon and can work this out for future situations. \n\nFor those commenting saying she\u2019s the A H, if you have never had a debilitating irrational phobia it\u2019s hard to understand but she would be experiencing fight or flight and even if she stayed with them she would likely not be able to care for her child.", "I knew about the phobia going into our marriage.

Anything smaller? Not happening, so I get how bad phobias can be.\n\n\nI'd ask her to come grab the kid, but until you are no longer vomiting, you shouldn't ask her to come back.", "NTA. OP, what happens if you or your child gets a chronic illness that involves nausea? Does she just never come home? The fact that therapy is just too hard for her to even consider is my problem here. Three years is a long time to have a child and expect to disappear every time a stomach virus comes along. Now, I can be petty when it comes to making serious points, but I would be tempted to just continue to tell her either I or the baby were sick until she got fucking tired of staying at her mom\u2019s and got some therapy, or admitted that her family just wasn\u2019t important enough to make an effort for and started divorce proceedings.

What does she do if SHE'S the one puking?", "I can't handle hearing other people vomit without immediately getting nauseous and frequently puking myself. It sucks. I hate it. It's an entirely involuntary physical reaction that I don't think there's a fix for.\n\nI also have a toddler. Toddlers get sick. They bring bugs into the house. The thing that made me saddest last time he was ill wasn't that I was throwing up, it's how useless I was while he was actively throwing up and could only be of help in-between because I had to either leave the room and be out of ear shot or I was just throwing up with him which doesn't give much room for being soothing. \n\nI am *furious* with your wife.

Sure, phobias are a real thing and there's something psychologically going on.. but with how she's functioning rn, she's not only affecting her own quality of life, but people around her!

You shouldn't have been left to take care of the child 24/7 when you needed support. You're perfectly entitled to be upset.\n\nI also see her side, because at my worst, I'd have rather have died than seen someone be sick. Fight or flight would kick in and I would remove myself from the situation, no matter what it was. It consumed my every day, the fear of both being sick and seeing sick so I can understand why she fled.\n\nHowever, this is something that she needs help with, and only she can take that step. I've had CBT, read the books, done the exposure etc. It is HARD. The exposure was awful, but it works. I always say I'm a recovering emetophobic because I think its something I'll always have, but I can cope with it a lot better now. At my worst, I couldn't even have my living room curtains open in case someone walking by got sick, whereas now if I see it, my heart races for a minute but I carry on.
