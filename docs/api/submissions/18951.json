You were sick and this woman literally left you to take care of your child on your own?? Gtfo.", "NTA. She left you to care for your 3 year old alone while you were dealing with an illness, like she only cares for her own health, but not her child's well-being? She thinks you're the selfish one? How would she feel next time she gets the flu if you said \"sorry, I'm terrified of the flu, I'm leaving you alone with our child until you're 100% better\"? So much for \"in sickness and in health\".", "NTA. I'm emetophobic, I still clean up vomit because sometimes you have to do that \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\n\nI say this gently: your wife needs to work with a professional on this. People vomit.", "NTA  \n\n\n5 days is a really long time to be gone because of the possibility that you could puke more, and leaving your child with you alone while your sick seems completely bananas, why not take your kid? why leave them with you when you could get them sick as well and prolong this? if you and your child got sick and were puking for like a back to back two weeks would being gone for a month be justified in her mind or something? no disrespect to her extreme phobia but wow, what even?", "NTA, because she left the 3 year old.", "NTA I\u2019m confused, how has she dealt with your child? Babies throw up alot. And are you telling me she left your child with you while you were sick?", "She left you WITH a toddler while you were super sick? Phobia or no phobia, your wife is a jerk.", "NTA, and you've been accommodating this during the 3 years you've had a child? I'm doubting this kid has never spit up or fully vomited.\n\nIf your wife is currently in treatment for this aversion, then she should follow the strategies of her counselor---and I don't think that would be \"Leave the house for a week if someone is ill.\"\n\nIf she is not currently in treatment then she needs to be.  This is aggravating to a spouse, but an untenable situation for a parent.", "NTA. \n\nEven if she got the most insane case of emetophobia, she is also a mother and wife. Het priorities are messed up. Imagine you being on a business trip and your kid gets sick.", "From the information given I would say NTA. The fact she left the child when the child wasn't sick is not okay at all. Especially if you're so sick to the point that it's been days. I get she has a phobia so her leaving cause she's absolutely terrified is fine but to abandon her child when they are perfectly fine is fucked up.", "NTA. Tell your wife to get some help because she\u2019s a mother and children throw up.", "NTA\n\nShe left you and your child over you getting somewhat sick? That\u2019s nuts.\n\nAlso don\u2019t most wedding vows say in sickness and in health?", "NTA- 100% using it has an excuse if no one\u2019s thrown up in 2+ days", "NTA.  How TF does wife expect to raise a child if she just peaces out at the slightest hint of vomit?  Look, I get that a phobia is a phobia but her reaction 5 days later is thoroughly unacceptable and not indicative of her having any interest in being a partner here.", "NTA\n\nAnd it's very concerning that she left your toddler alone with you while you were so very ill, while she took off for nearly a week already. \n\nFirst of all, how were you meant to take care of a 3-year-old, who needs constant supervision, meals made, etc., while you were so ill that you were vomiting constantly? And what was she doing at her mother's that meant that she couldn't have her child there? But most importantly, given that you clearly had a stomach virus of some sort (food poisoning wouldn't have lasted this long), why would she leave a HEALTHY toddler in the house with you when you were violently ill and likely contagious, while she left? Is she usually so irresponsible or indifferent to your child's health and welfare?", "NTA and I can\u2019t believe she left the kid with you when you were sick! Wow nice mom.", "NTA but your wife definitely is! How the hell did she manage to have a baby? They throw up. And her leaving your toddler with you while being so sick is incredibly selfish and irresponsible. She sounds like she needs some therapy!", "NTA. She shouldn't have become a mother if her phobia is so out of control she has to abandon her family for days at a time.\n\nThis should have been addressed a long time ago. She needs therapy and you need a partner who doesn't dissappear at the sign of vomit, especially with a child in the house.", "NTA \n\nI think there's other issues here at play, tbh. It goes deeper than her fear. This is something you both need to sit down and talk about honestly. She could be exhausted from all the responsibilities a 3 year old entails plus from whatever is going on in this marriage and at home. \n\nGet some marriage counseling as soon as you're feeling all better. Don't let this thing btwn you fester.", "NTA Your wife left a 3y old child with a person who is already sick. I understand her phobia but isn't that how relations work ? A little adjustment from both ends.You were okay with her being away even in the past and not taking care of you while you were sick.But she can't even come back despite leaving her child", "NTA.  It does sound as if she needs some sort of intensive counseling, especially since the two of you have a child.  Kids throw up all of the time.  If she refuses, I would take a hard look at my marriage if I were you.", "NTA - she can leave you (not very caring but you are an adult) but how can she leave your while sick WITH THE CHILD - and how can her own mother enable that? Children get sick - she chose to be a parent so she needs to step up - she needs to get treatment for her phobia before it turns her into a neglectful parent.", "NTA - You're a grown up, suck it up as you did. BUT, there is a child involved, I am assuming both you are the parents.  So not only did you suck it up, you took care of your child while doing it.  THAT my friend is a Varsity Adult move.", "NTA. If her phobia is that bad, why hasn\u2019t she gotten treatment for it, if only for the sake of your child? And , despite her phobia, has she even checked up on you to see how you are doing? The fact that you had to text her made it seem like she was out of contact for all those 5 days. It seems like she would at least have checked to see if you *and your child* were OK.", "NTA", "NTA. My kids have been ill to the point of throwing up multiple times. Not just as babies. How has she handled this? I know nothing about this phobia but this feels unreasonable and not fair to your kid. It\u2019s not fair to you either, but that might be a separate issue. \n\nI\u2019m having a hard time not judging her. I think it\u2019s more than reasonable to expect her to come home.", "Severe baby syndrome. Highly unlikely of ever being cured. What a shame. NTA by the way. People get sick all the time. What happens when she gets sick? Does she go into a coma? How were you taking care you your child? I don\u2019t know how bad your stomach bug was but why didn\u2019t your wife take your child at the least? Honestly this sounds like she took the opportunity to take a vacation from you two and doesn\u2019t want it to end.", "Jesus, if my husband pulled something like that, he would be getting his divorce papers right now.
