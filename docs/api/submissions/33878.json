His phone comment is a bit of a red flag unless that\u2019s just his utter eve rant sense of humour", "Nta. Replace him with someone who WILL.", "Absolutely bring this up, as long as you weren\u2019t intentionally eve\u2019s dropping I would even mention the conversation you overheard and let him know at least from your perspective that really upset you and made you feel unvalued", "How is this nsfw?", "NTA. Your boyfriend is old enough to know better. You spoke with him about this before\u2026but perhaps it has been too long. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to have a follow up discussion. \n\nINFO:\n\nIs your boyfriend thoughtful in other ways? Maybe gift giving is a source of anxiety for him. Some people hate picking out gifts.", "NTA, although I don't see where you actually addressed his poor gift giving.  Did you tell him that you felt like he didn't put any thought into it? I would let him know that getting junk just for the sake of saying he got you something is worse than just admitting that he doesn't want to exchange gifts.", "I wouldn't \"confront\" him.  I'd just stop buying him gifts. Or limit the shopping experience to five minutes at the corner gas station.\n\nNTA, though.", "NTA.  And instead of embarrassed and hurt you should be pissed.  This man is supposed to love you and instead he doesn't even feel bad flat telling people he got you \"just a bunch of random last minute crap\".  Does that sound like the words of someone who loves and respects you??  Now is the time to sit down and be honest with yourself and look at how often he makes you feel this way and all the times that his actions don't line up with his words.  I have a very strong suspicion that this is not a one time thing and is instead a pattern of crappy behavior.", "He knows what he's done. You could try asking him why he thought you might fancy salt and pepper shakers, however, if he plays dumb, I would calmly tell him that next time you'll reciprocate with something similar.

I'm 35, and if I gave my gf that last-minute gift, she would rip me a new asshole. God damn I feel sorry for you. Btw I'm a salt and pepper shaker collector, lol", "NTA.  You would be n AH to yourself if you put a second more time and effort in this relationship.  His conversation with his brother told you what he thinks of you and it is that you are not worth his time and effort.  No need to confront him, that takes more time and energy, just leave.  There are plenty of people out there that will value you.", "NTA\n\nYou have to confront him because it is bothering you.  If you don't, then the frustration will just continue to build until it erupts.  It is completely in bounds to express your disappointment.  \n\nAlso, you might consider giving him a list.  He may actually be relieved if you did.  I know that you would rather he be thoughtful and pick stuff out after reading your mind, but clearly this is not the boyfriend you chose, and though some people have that skill, others do not.  If he is a good boyfriend in other ways, you may need to take the reins in this one area.", "My wife and I decided long ago not to give each other gifts for birthdays or Christmas and to focus more on our girls.  I think this may be an example why.  Your bf admitted he just picked up some random crap which shows he wasn't even thinking about it and no, you're NTA because for you, this was important.  Maybe do the same for him next year or on his birthday, IF you're still together.", "Why bother confronting him? Leave.", "YTA if you continue to buy him nice gifts.  But him random last-minute crap and see what he thinks", "Absolutely NTA.  You already gave him an out on the responsibility and he said no.  Then what did he give you?  \"Just a bunch of random last minute crap\".  The disrespect.  I hope this man is showing up meaningfully in other areas of your life.", "NTA\n\nHe really fucked up when he used his outside voice with his brother\n\nHope you can keep your cool when it inevitably comes out, and he can step up at least one notch from complete ass hat", "NTA\n\nIt is very appropriate to bring this up.\n\nYou bought him nice thought out presents and he buys you a few cheap bits of crap. To add insult to injury he then goes on to boast about it to his brother, and how insulted you are by this.\n\nMaybe you need to be looking for a new BF", "NTA - You have every right to bring it up and discuss it. But I also want you to accept that this does not equal \"every gift from now on will be how I want it\". You care about this a lot and put the time into it, that is not the same for everybody and sounds like it's not the same for your boyfriend. \n\nIf everything else about him is fine, he just sucks at giving gifts, great. That's a small issue. That's not a groundbreaking issue. That's not a \"what the fuck is wrong with you\" issue. That's one tiny thing that he's not perfect at, and that's ok. \n\nHe can care about, love, and respect you, without gift giving being part of it. I have a feeling this sub will tell you he's a demon in mans clothes and I just REEEEEEEALLLY don't think that's how it goes here.", "INFO - You\u2019re just talking about gift giving, not anything else. How does he treat you otherwise?  I had a bf who would either forget or give last minute gifts most of the time. However, he would go out to the car and warm it up before I got in, he\u2019d stop by the grocery store if he noticed I was out of milk, paper towels, etc. he\u2019d walk my dog if he was over and it was rainy.  In other words, he showed me everyday that he cared, not just during holidays or birthdays.", "She\u2019s asking if she would be the AH for addressing it.", "She's asking she would be the AH for addressing it \"again.\" It seemed like addressing it the first time was hinting that they could skip it."]}
