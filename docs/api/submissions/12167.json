Rented a condo with a pool by the beach. Pool had an incident that resulted in it closing. (Drunk injury of another resident, blood in water.) Spoke to the company. They said we could get a refund if we wanted to leave or they could move us to a different location. \n\nWe moved and OMG. It was so nice. They gave us a full house with its own pool. We fell in love with the location. Next year we brought more friends so we could rent the same house.

AirBnBs are the wild west, and it's *extremely* unusual for the platform to provide a solution like in this post.

We have an amazing management company. You can not half ass your management of a property. Either you have to be responsive and right there, or you have to hire an amazing manager. \n\n I'm with you. I used to use small companies to rent and when I rent now, I still try to find that, but it's become so hard. Literally no one wants to google a few keywords or go to more than one site. We get the majority of our bookings from vrbo or airbnb which imo is so silly, because you can book directly from my management, and it's slightly less money! We also have to pay through the wazoo to keep up our listings on both sites. I just hate them, but they have a monopoly. I still need my manager and they do a bang up job. Yes, they take a big commission. Worth it, it's literally stress free for me.", "I miss when Airbnb was a cheaper alternative to hotels, I used to use them frequently when I had extended stays and wanted access to a kitchen. Now they let hosts charge absolutely batshit insane cleaning fees or allow them to make ridiculous cleaning rules for guests like making them wash sheets and towels before leaving. \nI now use hotels almost exclusively, even if I need a kitchen I look for one of those suite/apartment hotels that offer kitchens. \nAirbnb has gotten so ridiculous.", "You got all your money back and you\u2019re still there?

That friend is wrong, and you are right to ask for money back... however I am dubious about how quickly the poll turned green. For it to go that filthy in a short period of time is suspicious. I have a pool and also live in FL, and when our pool pump went out it took longer than 36 hours for the pool to start showing light algae in the pool. That is most likely because the pool did not have anywhere near enough chlorine in it to help keep the water clean, the pump filtration was likely already close to being fully clogged which put extra pressure on the pump, and all the other filter baskets that catch leaves/debris (if it is outside a screen) were not emptied out. All of these things would have put extra pressure on the pump and it is no wonder it failed. \n\nNTA. They promised a pool for your duration, no one came out to assist - In places where there are many pools in peoples property... you can get someone out within 1 to 24 hours.

If the owner has a problem with that, they should take it up with AirBnB, not the customer. It's rough (and does seem a little ridiculous to me), but that's how working through a company works, no?

He's right, of course, lol. \n\nI'm way old, so I remember that way back in the day, it was actually the norm for a vacation rental to be cheaper than a hotel, and you had to do your own cleaning and throw the towels/sheets in the wash. Now it's not the industry standard, and I think that's a good thing. I wouldn't trust a guest to do proper cleaning/washing, as an owner or a guest, and frankly they shouldn't be asked to do that anyway.", "> Where is it written they must find reasonable time? Who would enforce this?\n\nIt's not \"who would enforce the resonable time\", but rather \"who would enforce him having to leave immediately?\"\n\nCourts generally operate on a standard of \"Reasonableness\", as in what would a reasonable person do or think?
