You have very solid logic and are making a good decision to wait to have kids until you can afford them. The offer of having them sooner if they can give you the financial support to take care of them is very sound and frankly generous. No one else has any business dictating if and when you and your husband have children, family or no, and you are being generous to give them a choice in the matter. \n\nWith that said, your husband is right that you could have been nicer  about it. You\u2019re not the ah because it sounds like they\u2019ve been badgering you about having kids, and it\u2019s your and your husband\u2019s decision, but not being the asshole doesn\u2019t do much to protect the relationship with your in laws. I think it wouldn\u2019t be amiss to apologize for how you spoke to them but be clear that you just can\u2019t afford kids yet, and if it\u2019s important to them to have grandkids before you can afford them, you need their help to be financially stable enough to afford kids.\n\nAlso a quick side note that I really don\u2019t like how they speak about wanting grandkids \u201cwhile they can enjoy them\u201d. No one should be having children just because they want to have fun with them. It\u2019s a huge commitment and responsibility.

You were just turning the situation around on them to get them to see the light. I don't think it was harsh at all. It's not up to them to dictate when or if you even have kids.
