That other woman could have offered up their seat if they were so worried about it.  \n\nIf the elderly woman asked you to swap, or the driver asked you to swap, and you said no, this would be a different story.", "Honestly, if you had a legitimate reason -- and a physically taxing job would do it -- AND the lady who was standing didn't ask/insist or seem to be in distress... I would say NTA. Assuming that someone is capable or is not capable of standing on a bus based *solely* on age is honestly kinda ableist... you don't know what hidden disabilities (or even an acute illness) someone might have that would make it difficult or impossible for them to stand.\n\nFor the record, I'm all for giving up one's seat to an elderly person if you're able-bodied. But strangers can't assume someone is or isn't just because they're \"young\". And nobody else was willing to give up their seat, so I'd say there were probably plenty of other AHs on the bus who could have but simply didn't.", "NTA. The elderly lady in question didn't even ask. I'm not sure why this woman felt the need to butt in. It reminds me of how my aunt always treated my grandma like she was glass and it irritated her to no end.

My feet hurt to the point that I'll stand on one foot to give the other foot a bit of a break. Every time I get on a bus or streetcar after work, I pray there will be an empty seat. Sometimes there is, and other times there isn't. I'm glad that, in this case, there was a seat for you.\n\nThe elderly woman herself said she didn't need the seat. I think it's fine that the other woman asked you (I've done the same myself), and, at least from your post, the woman asking didn't make any judgemental comments to you afterward (if she did, though, then NTA).", "Man, I was ready to blast you, but if you really were hurting, NTA.", "NTA I am a woman and I once gave up my seat to an elderly person. My husband and child were sitting next to me and didn't offer either. Many people should have offered but no one else did. I know what it is like to work on your feet for 16 hours and how painful it is, so I don't blame you. I think society has moved away from being compassionate and respectful towards others.

Or they are just fit. Old doesn't mean ill or fragil. The elderly woman didn't asked for the seat.
