I said well he was my boyfriend at the time and I felt you two were getting too close and she asked me to leave and shut the door in my face and my parents took her side and before I left my mom said \"oh honey Nick is coming for Thanksgiving your cousins and Sister missed him \".

Your sister not understanding social cues is not a reason to need help getting undressed by your boyfriend.  That's something way beyond Asperger's syndrome and/or autism.  It's creepy!  You are not overreacting and your parents are massively under reacting.  This is a situation which could lead to serious danger for your sister.  Even if your ex never touches her except to undress her (just writing that grosses me out) it could cause her to be too trusting of other men who just might assault her.  Please remind your parents and that ex of this.  If they care for her they should be trying to protect her and teach her better safety skills than this.  If your sister is having this much difficulty, this could even be a situation where Adult Protective Services needs to be notified because she really is in a bad situation.  I don't know the level of assistance your sister needs, but it doesn't sound like she's fully independent.  Yes, she needs a friend.  No, she doesn't need one who undresses her.

You deserve better from family and partners.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou sister is a vulnerable adult who cannot care for herself. Nick was grooming her to take advantage of that.

You being jelly is reasonable especially if he hes helping her get undressed if they did anything or not that's still weird and a reasonable reason to get jelly. And for your parents to invite him to Thanksgiving  is rude mabey the next Thanksgiving or another father away date but so recently after the break up is rude and so if you need a bigger break from him and that means not coming to Thanksgiving they should understand. Sorry if this doesn't make sense I have a hard time explaining stuff lol.", "Ummmm NTA at all and I\u2019m really creeped out for you.", "NTA...drawing baths is a bit 2 personal. You had boundaries and he made you feel bad for them. He could still be friends with her if he wanted and they invited him so you two can get back together", "Wow just reading this it cannot be true surely!!\nBut if it is you and your parents think it's OK for a grown man to undress your 23yr old sister. \nI have experience of asperger's and she would not need this level of help. You are making excuses for a relationship that if true is inappropriate. Also he gets to be treated more as family than you , he is moving you out bit like a cockoo. Again if true you need a long hard look in the mirror if you seriously think any part of this is ok.", "INFO: was there grooming going on? Sounds like you may have been targeted because you had a socially naive sister who was vulnerable. It may also be the opposite, that you chased off a gem of a guy. There's not enough info to go on.", "I'm going to go with ESH, but also leaning towards NTA just based on what he did while helping her into the bath.\n\nYou should definitely edit to add that Nick was helping her undress and get in and out of the bath, not just only getting the bath ready for her. That seems like a MAJOR boundary to cross to me. It seems weird to me that your parents wouldn't have found that inappropriate at all. Not having him do that feels like a very appropriate and necessary boundary to set, especially to safeguard your sister.\n\nYes, there are things you could have done differently, like talking with Nick about how his behavior towards your sister made you uncomfortable before taking the nuclear option, but in the end that doesn't really matter because, to me, he definitely crossed a boundary that you shouldn't cross with the sibling of a partner.\n\nAgain, it's weird that your family is prioritizing Nick's feelings over yours. I just don't get it. Also, from reading the comments, your grandma was the one that potentially paranoid/concerned about Nick's behavior, but now she's letting him move in with her? I'm so confused.", "Need more info. \n\nYou say she has Asperger\u2019s, but any comorbidities? I ask because I have it too, but it sounds like she could other cognitive issues.

It doesn't seem like you and him had much discussion on this issue before breaking up with him. I see where you're coming from but I feel like we're lacking lots of context to determine if their relationship.was inappropriate.

I agree that your ex and parents are way out of line and he\u2019s definitely being inappropriate with your sister.\n\nBut wow\u2026do your parents expect your sister to dictate your love life.

I'm so confused.

That is weird stuff.", "If you don't think that someone with Asperger's can be groomed, then you don't understand how autism/Asperger's works. As someone who has an exceptionally high IQ and who is autistic (and whose diagnosis is technically Asperger's), I was a victim of a great deal of sexual coercion and inappropriate sexual behaviour because that IS \"social behaviour\" and as bright as I was intellectually, I was desperately lonely and wanted to be liked (as it sounds Annabelle is) and had ABSOLUTELY NO UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WAS APPROPRIATE OR INAPPROPRIATE in the context of male/female interactions, crushes, sexual relationships, etc. because people in my life, much like you, assumed that intellegence = functional understanding of reciprocal relationships.\n\nNo one explained consent to me, or that I could withdraw consent if I was uncomfortable, or that I didn't have to do things with men that I liked or wanted to like me if the specific things they were asking of me made me feel wrong or uncomfortable.\n\nNo one explained that sexual behaviours would have emotional repercussions. No one explained that neurotypical people would misinterpret my totally innocent sensory seeking behaviour as sexual - that \\*I\\* wouldn't even understand that I was just seeking sensory input and that it DIDN'T HAVE TO BE SEXUAL - and that I would be shamed and ostracised for being \"oversexed\" when all I was looking for was a cuddle or a pet. \n\nYOU COULD NOT POSSIBLY BE MORE WRONG if you think that someone with Asperger's or autism, because they are \"rational\" will understand that they can \"shut things down when they get uncomfortable\". THAT IS A SOCIAL CUE. Moreover, anyone who has had ABA (Applied Behavioural Analysis) \"therapy\" ... which is most autistic/Aspie people in the U.S. of several generations at this point . . . has been taught NOT to trust their instincts, that their autistic instincts are inherently wrong, and instead to seek external validation and approval. It's one of the reasons autistic/Aspie people are so likely to be the victims of sexual abuse; because we are taught to ignore our own feelings of discomfort LITERALLY BY OUR SUPPOSED \"AUTISM THERAPISTS\" and trust neurotypical people to tell us when something is okay or not. Which often means relying on predators to tell us whether or not they are sexually preying on us. \n\nThis is a shitshow and OP is NTA.

Is she on par with her age or is she of lower functioning mentally than her chronological age?", "And had you been conveying this sentiment to him all along?

Making a bath is not a big deal. It's basically turning on the water and maybe some bath soaps or bombs or whatever.

My arm was in a soft cast from wrist to shoulder, I couldn't get it wet, couldn't use it, so my friend helped me wash everything I couldn't reach one handed and with my hair.

Does she go without showering unless someone helps remove her clothes?!\n\nIf it were me, I would find other family members to stay with or hang out with to clear my head and go low contact with the people directly impacting my mental health (or the immediate family and ex in your case). Just make sure you have a healthy support system \u2018cause you are definitely not getting it from your family. If anything they are gaslighting you.\n\nNTA", "Maybe you should go watch that movie Single, White Female. Reading through your comments, this whole situation sounds weird and there are too many contradictions for me to be able to make a determination here.", "NTA. *Your boyfriend undressed your 23 year old sister 4 times and gave her a bath?!?!* And YOU'RE out of line? Yeah, absolutely not. When she ends up pregnant, try not to say, \"I told you so.\" For some crazy reason, your parents have basically given your sister to your ex boyfriend. That's crazy, but there's nothing you can do. Good job in ending that relationship. Stay far away from that circus. I'm sorry the people around you have such terrible judgment.", "Why. Is. He. Drawing. Her. BATHS!!!!!! She\u2019s 23. Not 3. \n\nEw \u2026 just ew.\n\nI don\u2019t think Nick AND Annabelle are trying something. I think Nick is taking advantage. \n\nNTA.", "This kinda hops around.  Last night you saw him reading to her but then didn't talk to them for 2 months?  I'm a little confused", "NTA  \nI have good friends with Asperger's. I myself am on the spectrum. It is not some debilitating condition that requires 24h support. Either you have the wrong condition in the post, or she is playing everyone.", "How is this grooming just curious", "Gradually getting someone to trust you, making that person think it's normal to let them take your clothes off and having her bathe when he is around.", "Right... Besides the fact that OP claims she just broke up with Nick last night then proceeds to say her parents and sister haven't talked to her in two months over it... how does that work?!", "He\u2019s giving me sir cristian cole vibes. Big yikes", "Exactly. But does she have a strong sense of boundaries? A sense of self preservation against people with predatory intentions?", "I wonder if the parents are hoping this turns into a relationship and they can transfer the responsibility to a spouse if she gets married. *shudder*", "levels aren't used either. \n\nNor is High and Low functioning. Those all go back to Mr. Asperger the nazi guy who used functioning levels to determine which folks were useful in the death camps. \n\nI'm an adult autistic human who was diagnosed at 47", "Well, yeah.  If my bestie broke her arm or something, I'd help her bathe.  But this whole situation is odd.", "B-I-N-G-O", "Sweet people don't take their ex girlfriends families away from them this guy is a psycho & your fam is stupid for allowing him near them. NTA.", ">Girl, just no. \n\n>I'm 26(M)\n\nUm... INFO: which is it?", "Yes this is a real issue. Im appalled that the parents are so appallingly comfortable with this walking red flag of a guy. Nick."]}
