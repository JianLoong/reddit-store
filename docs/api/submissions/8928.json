He and my mum have 2 kids in 9 years of marriage, I\u2019m not his own and it\u2019s clear I\u2019m a reminder that his wife was a non-virgin divorced woman before him so of course I\u2019m being treated like a guest and my mum is allowing it because she thinks the sun shines out of his ass. He doesn\u2019t need my money to pay rent, plus I don\u2019t have much and he wants \u00a3100 per month. We still have lots of time for this but I bet his own kids won\u2019t be paying rent while they\u2019re in school. \n\nMy A level exams (uk school system) start mid April and last up to July. I\u2019m doing STEM subjects and I\u2019m hoping to fulfil my offer for a medicine course at a good university. I\u2019m aiming for A* A* A* A which will take a lot of studying, and if I have to get a job it will be difficult to maintain that level of studying that I need to do. \n\nI\u2019m literally moving out in September. (Idk if the university finances differ in the USA and Ik this platform is predominantly American, so in the UK uni is funded by loans, and these loans cover everything and are 100% my responsibility and my parents won\u2019t be financing anything).

Her house is an hour away but my school is in the middle (30 mins each way if that makes sense). She said she has a guest room free so I can save my money for uni. This benefits me most so I took her up on the offer. \n\nMy mother keeps crying that I\u2019m leaving already, so my step dad is annoyed. We got into an argument where he said he\u2019s just treating me like a tenant to prepare me for the real world, so I said \u201cdo tenants not have the right to leave?\u201d Which annoyed him further. My step dad says im hurting my mother and taking resources from my aunt because im \u201ctoo entitled\u201d to pay rent. This is just what\u2019s best for me. I said I\u2019d visit.

Tell her no matter what stepdad's excuses are, you're very aware of how the real world works, and in the real world acing your exam, getting scholarships, and getting a good degree will help you a LOT more than some 'tough love' life lesson that leaves you with worse grades and a worse education.

My dad made me pay rent increasing by $100/month until I moved out. I was a little shit that didn't feel like working and didn't feel like working for a job, didn't have any intention to go to school. I needed that lesson.\n\nYou don't look like you're in that situation.

(Trying to think how to say it, because I've never thought I needed to before!)\n\nLook, if a family can't survive on 1 (or 2!) incomes, then obviously more work needs to happen. That should *always* fall on the parents where possible, but sometimes it's not. So if there's a financial need, then yeah, adult children, maybe even older teens might need to chip in if they can.\n\nWithout that financial need, the only reasons for children to contribute to the household finances are 1) because they want to, 2) to learn income-management skills, and 3) to teach responsibility.\n\nFrom what I've read here, there's no financial *need*. You don't want to pay rent, you're trying to save money for school, so that's the income management, and you've made arrangements which will allow you to meet your goals... which is the responsibility thing.\n\nI don't know you as a person, or your family, so IDK if this is accurate. You might have really poor financial skills, and it's possible step-dad *is* trying to teach that. However, if you're reading this situation as coming from a place of spite, and you don't think it makes financial sense, whether you're right or wrong, you wouldn't *learn* anything from what he's trying to teach you.\n\nMeanwhile you can't stay there without paying, you're an adult and can choose to move out, and your aunt is an adult who can choose who stays in her home.\n\nI don't think you're doing a single thing wrong here. Your aunt isn't doing anything wrong here.\n\nIf your step-dad is coming from a negative place with this, then he's the AH. If your mom knows this and isn't defending you, she's a (lesser) AH.\n\n... as a side note, I'd strongly suggest \"paying rent\" to yourself while you're in school, into a second savings account if you can have one, or to an adult you can trust not to touch it, if you have one. Really it'd just be another savings account, but it will help you to build a habit of paying rent *and* saving money every month. \n\nFor example, my child's plan for when working begins (already started with the odd job-for-a-neighbor, lol) is to use half of each paycheck for spending. The other half will be divided into rent, savings, and \"sharing\". \n\nSavings is an account my child will manage alone. Sharing is for gifts for others and/or for charity. Rent is paid to me, but then I place it in a savings account for when my child is ready to move. It will go to rent eventually, I'm sure... first last and deposit, most likely. \n\nYou could do the same with your aunt, or even on your own, if you like!\n\nSorry your family is going through this, but no, you're not the AH!", "NTA. Your Mom's husband is an ass. The rent was to make him feel better about having you live there. You are an adult. You made a wise decision. No one would pay rent if you have an alternative.

No no, I must be completely ignorant to how things work. I kept repeating \"Not until I'm working\" and various things alluding to the fact that there was more at play and it was a family decision but they kept pushing it until I was forced to say \"I gave them money out of my student finance while I was at uni to pay their bills. I. Don't. Pay. Rent.\" they got very quiet and didn't bring it up again after that. \n\nGoing to uni in the UK is very much preparing you for the real world. Halls is a gentle introduction to being a tenant. You'll have to do food shopping and cook (generally, I know some do but my uni didn't offer any catered halls) but not be responsible for bills besides the rent, probably have a cleaner for communal areas etc. Then after first year you'll most likely move into a house with friends and be a proper tenant with all the bills and responsibilities of looking after a house. All while studying and managing a budget of income that comes in 3 lumps (cos that's totally how the world works). \n\nOn that note some things you should be aware of, it can take a few days for your first payment to come in after you start and you'll probably have to pay a deposit for your halls on results day so you'll need a few hundred pounds available to cover that and those first few days food etc. Also your halls rent schedule might not line up with student finance payments, you might find yourself having to pay an extra few weeks rent up front out of a student finance payment that expected those weeks to be covered by the next one. You should also look up a SF calculator if you haven't already to check how much you actually are eligible for. I know it can get complicated where step-parents are involved. You say he doesn't need the money you would be paying him. If he has a high income you need to make sure that his income is not included or you could end up getting very shortchanged.\n\nVery much NTA, I hope you enjoy living with your Aunt and are able to get those A\\*s now you're away from your stepdad.

If it starts to impact you, ask to see a school counsellor and talk to them. If you can afford it, find a private counsellor who specialises in family trauma, and can take you on as a low income patient and offer a discount. I expect if you go to your GP, their services are massively overstretched right now and you'll be waiting months. If you need to take a years break before uni, do it, don't get hung up on the \"if I don't go now, I won't succeed/won't be a doctor/I won't have the funding/I'll fail/I'm a failure\" arguments.

Don't be afraid to use these services if you need to. There will also be a fund for students who are struggling financially. You may be offered a loan, or it maybe a grant if you describe your situation and prove you can't pay your bills at any stage. Also, if anything happens and you need to defer for a year, or you struggle and find yourself only able to complete half your modules one year, then half the next (meaning an extra year at uni) do it. \n\nI'd also recommend you have a free, complimentary chat with a solicitor (first 30mins is free) about your rights, as I believe that you can claim maintenance until you are 20 years old, so long as you are in approved higher education courses, and over 12 hours a week.\n\nAs a side note, it's worth considering that your step-father is likely jealous of you. You are on the fast track to an amazing life, and he had nothing to do with it. He didn't create you, and it sounds like hasn't been a great support for the years he has been around. He is aging and who knows, maybe he is going through an early mid life crisis.

That isn't your problem though, she has made her decisions and continues to do so. Don't get sucked into their shit anymore, look after yourself, start making boundaries.
