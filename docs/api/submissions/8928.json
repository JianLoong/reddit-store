He doesn\u2019t need my money to pay rent, plus I don\u2019t have much and he wants \u00a3100 per month.

Her house is an hour away but my school is in the middle (30 mins each way if that makes sense). She said she has a guest room free so I can save my money for uni. This benefits me most so I took her up on the offer. \n\nMy mother keeps crying that I\u2019m leaving already, so my step dad is annoyed. We got into an argument where he said he\u2019s just treating me like a tenant to prepare me for the real world, so I said \u201cdo tenants not have the right to leave?\u201d Which annoyed him further. My step dad says im hurting my mother and taking resources from my aunt because im \u201ctoo entitled\u201d to pay rent. This is just what\u2019s best for me. I said I\u2019d visit.

Tell her no matter what stepdad's excuses are, you're very aware of how the real world works, and in the real world acing your exam, getting scholarships, and getting a good degree will help you a LOT more than some 'tough love' life lesson that leaves you with worse grades and a worse education.

My dad made me pay rent increasing by $100/month until I moved out. I was a little shit that didn't feel like working and didn't feel like working for a job, didn't have any intention to go to school. I needed that lesson.\n\nYou don't look like you're in that situation.

Your mother hasn't supported you at all here and can't complain that you've got out of this toxic situation.", "NTA. I'm in the US but know a few people who have done the exams and uni where you are, and those exams need to be your priority. Whatever gives you the option to concentrate on that is what you need to do. \n\nSorry your mum and stepdad don't see it that way, but don't let them impact your entire future with their stunts.", "NTA I would also recommend a call to the child benefit agency, especially if your mum and stepdad are not contributing anything to your aunt as they're likely still claiming the child benefit they'd be entitled to while you're still in full time education.", "Dude if your in the uk and still in full time education then they\u2019re still getting child benefit for you. I\u2019d see if you can get that transferred over to your aunt or yourself.", "NTA\n\nYou step father wanted to play the \"real world\" card but it back fired. In the real world parents don't try to pull down their children, but support the to a higher level. It kind of come with being a parent. And if your own mother let's this behavior continue then she is no better than him. \n\nPlease move out to your aunt's and do what you need to do. It's for the best. \n\nWish you all the best!", "No, man, you're doing well for yourself. Your stepdad is an asshole, and your mom is his enabler. I'm really sorry that you have to be in this situation. Try to help out your aunt inasmuch as possible - maybe do the shopping, learn some cooking, ask her what she needs.", "Your stepdad caused this chaos and now he wants you to PAY to fix it. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. If your mother wanted you to remain, she would act like a mother and not charge you rent while you are in school preparing for uni.", "NTA and a special award for your aunt coming in clutch with the room.\n\nGood luck with your exams!\n\nETA: In principle I would agree that if you were staying at home, you should be paying rent but only IF you were no longer in the education system. This is the time when you should be preparing for your future, not prematurely providing for it.", ">My mother keeps crying that I\u2019m leaving already,\n\nShe's crying and she's hurt but she's not stopping him, is she? Which says it all.\n\nDefinitely NTA. Go live with your aunt, study in peace, ace the A-levels.", "NTA. I'm in the UK (F50s) and in my view you don't pay rent while you're in FT education, not least because the government is still providing funding and tax credits. \n\nYour job right now is to focus on getting your uni place. I can't help wondering if at some level he's trying to sabotage that. Don't let him. If your own mother won't stand up to him for you, go to your aunt. Put a hard deadline on it to reduce the risk of it derailing you as you'll be starting revision soon.", "Yes you are", "Yesss! This is the best advice and I hope OP reads this and takes it in. Also, when you finally reach your goal and become a successful person (cause I know you will) don't let these so called parents take advantage of you. There will be a time when they will come to you for money.  It's always for money! They will use the \"but we are family/I'm your mother/I raised you/you owe me or us\" Just know you don't owe them anything. You take your aunt's offer and you make sure to always find a way to show her how much you appreciate her! Even in the most simplest way like legit telling her straight out or going out of your way to help her with even the smallest thing. When she tells you no, it's ok you tell her to let you do it. Like carry the groceries... and you tell her you appreciate her so much and you just want her to know it and that's why you made breakfast or did extra chores, carrying the groceries, washed her car... OP I wish you the best!", "I'm sorry, but for some reason I read your comment in the voice of Phoebe like \"don't do it Monica, for god's sake DON'T DO IT\"\n\nAnd suffice to say, you are right, and NTA OP. You are not going to be a \"burden\" to them, and they are well equipped to visit you if they do care enough.", "Tell her that if she actually protected you like a mother instead of letting her husband treat you in such an awful way, you wouldn't be leaving.", "Exactly this. OP isn\u2019t the one causing the upset, but I\u2019m sure the stepdad is the type to blame others for the chaos he causes. Mom can either stand up to her husband, or accept that he\u2019s pushing her child out of the house.", " Your mum is upset that you're leaving already but you'd be leaving anyway come September.", "Reading between the lines here, but it sounds to me like having an adult conversation with the step dad would achieve nothing.", "Ooh yes. If you're 18, you should have one. If parents didn't set it up, then one would have been opened for you when you were about 3 - it started with \u00a3250 and grows quite nicely. My young teen's is worth around \u00a31k now.", "The aunt may be entitled to the child benefit payments when they move in with her", "It's hard sometimes when emotions come into play. It's easy to say it on the outside looking in, but when it's your mom crying and another adult in your house shouting at you, sometimes things can get all turned around and hard to sort out. A little external validation that they're on the right path can mean the difference between caving and standing one's ground.", "Found the step dad."]}
