I decided to give her a voucher for a private alpaca hike as a present. We all like animals but I also thought it would be a good opportunity for some family time, maybe including our parents and her kids.  \nOver time, I've asked her every few months if she had some plans already, not to push her to do it but simply for planning reasons, so I wouldn't be on vacation then or something. She was always dismissive of the idea, not directly saying she didn't wanna do it but always like \"I don't wanna think about it right now, we'll have to see ...\" giving off the vibe that she was a bit annoyed by the inquiry and not keen on doing it at all, so I left it at that.  \nThe time passed and nothing ever came of it. I recently noticed that the voucher would expire at the end of this year and I didn't want it to go to waste, as it a) would have been sad but also b) the hike was fully prepaid, non-refundable and not that cheap (200\u20ac) because it is exclusive to the group with a dedicated guide.  \nA few days ago, I thus texted my sister via WhatsApp, saying:  \n\"Hey, how are you and the kids? How is it going? Just a quick question: do you already have some plans for the alpaca hike? I noticed that the voucher expires by the end of the year and it would be a shame if it would expire unused, also as it was somewhat pricey. Do you wanna do it? If not I would also take the voucher and go in your place. Have a nice day!\"  \nI didn't receive any answer whatsoever. Today I saw her at an unrelated family gathering. Towards the end I asked her \"did you read my message?\" she was like \"yea ...\" and I responded \"and you didn't wanna reply or ...?\". She said \"No it wouldn't have been nice ...\". Then I took her aside and asked what the problem was.  \nShe then started to quietly yell at me that it was totally disrespectful to watch so closely what happened to the gift and that she would never \"ask for a present back\", especially in that \"demanding tone of mine\", being extremely pissy about it. I went ahead and explained that it was really not my intent to upset her, that I thought she maybe had forgotten about it in the stress with the kids and all, and that it wasn't an allegation or criticism. Also I reiterated that I by no means am asking for anything back, I'm just offering to jump in to prevent the voucher from expiring unused if she didn't wanna go.  \nShe wouldn't have any of it, insisted that it was \"totally weird and inappropriate\" and that it wasn't my business what happened with her presents. She then explained that I \"don't need to worry about it\" as she would do it but without me and that she wouldn't talk about it anymore. I'm pretty sure that she wouldn't have done it at all if I hadn't said something and the main reason she's now doing it is spite.  \nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1696605043, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/171eu8q/aita_for_reminding_my_sister_a_voucher_for_an/", "score": 237, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This sounds like a gift maybe you should have bought for yourself and you could have planned and invited the whole family. By giving it to your sister (who I don't know if she actually wanted something like that) you gave up your right to have such an investment to what happens to the gift. Maybe she wants to go with her besties or something. Maybe she sold it to someone and bought something she had actually wanted. I don't know and it's no longer really your business.\n\nEdited to add: It kind of also sounds like a kind of a gift that requires work on her part. The tour is paid for, but she has to schedule it and ask everyone and make sure the date is agreed upon (assuming she wanted to bring all of ya'll) and corral the kids, etc. And depending on how division of labor goes in her nuclear family, this might have required a lot of work on her part (having to get the kids ready and catering to them).", "YTA - when you give a gift it is no longer under your control. You\u2019ve released it into the world. You have made a gift into an *obligation* which is really unpleasant.", "YTA, mild.  Your sister has the right to do with the present as she wants, and your constant reminders are, at best, intrusive.  In addition, your present seemed as much for yourself as for her.\n\nNext time, buy a present for her and just let it go.", "YTA--- you kept reminding her over and over about the unused gift...and then said that you'd take it back...\n\nNormally when you gift someone something, you don't badger them over and over until they use it....its on her to use to voucher, not for you to micromanage when and how they use it.", "YTA - You gave her a gift and then continually harassed her about using said gift. Also, for giving her a gift that was something you clearly wanted and expected to be included in the use of. Even if she only goes now out of spite, so what!?! At least the money won't be wasted, which is what you claimed your issue was.", "YTA\n\nYou gave her the voucher and then you stalked her about it. Do you do that with all gifts you give?\n\nThats just weird.\n\nWhat if you gave her a purse? And if you didnt see her using it, would you ask her every couple of months if she was going to use it? And then would you ask her if she doesnt want to use it, can you have it back to use instead. \n\nThis is the same thing.\n\nIf she uses it, she does, if she never does, its her business. You already paid for the voucher and gave it to her so its hers to waste or not. But quit bugging her about it.", "YTA.  Once you give a present, it is out of your hands, out of your life, and should be out of your head.\n\nIt isn't your sister's duty to report back to you what she did with it.  Her present, her choices.   And giving her a present that you expected her to use on your parents, as well as her own kids, isn't a present; it's an obligation.\n\nYour sister is right to be angry.   You're nagging her about something that was supposed to make her happy.  You're acting as if she owes it to you to go on the trip.  You're acting as if you still own it, so she owes it back to you.\n\nWhen you give a present, let it go.", "YTA once you give a gift it's on her if she lets it go to waste.

Take the hint she doesn\u2019t like the gift and leave her alone.", "YTA. It\u2019s weird to micromanage a gift. Never give a gift that you aren\u2019t okay with going to waste because sometimes it just happens.

A gift is to be given and let go. It doesn\u2019t matter what the recipient does with it, it\u2019s a gift! Why did you give her the gift? Was it something you wanted for yourself? Can\u2019t you get something similar for yourself? It reminds me of someone that \u201cgot me\u201d and edible gift, and after a few days started helping themselves to it! Lol.

Please respect boundaries. Your sister has vocalized why she is upset. The community has spoken. Please seek professional help.", "Wow, all the people here giving the Y T A votes are being weirdly aggressive and hostile about it just like the sister.. I'm side eyeing y'all hard as heck.

If you wanted to go on a family hike you could have arranged that separately.", "It's her gift and her choice what she does with it. I would think twice about giving her gifts in the future.\nYTA", "Soft YTA but I understand you not wanting it to go to waste.

You wanted to go on the alpaca ride. You wanted to include your parents and kids. You wanted family time. You tried to give yourself a gift. When you didn't get what you wanted you bugged your sister about it enough to make her angry. That's always asshole behavior. You should have asked your sister if she wanted to join and planned the excursion, since it's what you wanted. She should have received a gift that wasn't for you.", "Don\u2019t give these kind of gift if you can\u2019t forget about it and move on. Don\u2019t give gift that requires a follow-up and an additional accountability from the person that receives the gift to the gift giver. It\u2019s a one way thing.

I said what I said.", "YTA. It was a gift you gave her, and judging by her response, it's likely she gave it to someone else.", "I think it is weird to keep asking about it repeatedly. Maybe after a year or so, I can see asking once, but if she seemed uninterested in doing it, just let it go. Once you give a gift, it's the person you give it to's choice to do with what they want. I'd say YTA on this.", "YTA \n\n& the sheer amount of comments you've already replied to, with great detail, and, rather defensively most of the time - since this thread has been posted is just another indicator of how high maintenance you might be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n end run on sentence", "NTA.  \nHave you considered that she really didn't want it an regifted it?

She definitely regifted the voucher though.", "NTA I don\u2019t see anything wrong with asking about it, especially to your sibling", "NTA.\n\nAll the opposite votes are really blowing my mind.", "NTA. Normally when you give a gift you don't ask about it, but a voucher like this seems different to me, because the giver gets reminders that it is about to expire. Your sister is being petty here\u2014if she doesn't want to go she should see to it that someone else gets to. It's weird to me that she is being so defensive about it when you have made it clear you are not judging her if she doesn't want to go, you're just trying to let someone have its value.", "YTA\n\nBecause here\u2019s the thing, you gave her the voucher to use as she sees fit so that means you don\u2019t get to decide when or even if she uses it. Also did you ask her if that was something she\u2019d like? Because before you buy someone an event you should be sure that they would like the specific event you\u2019re thinking of, unless you can afford to take the chance of wasting the money should they not actually want to go. If you wanted to take her on the hike then you should have made that the gift , like basically a voucher but it\u2019s between the two of you. Then when she\u2019s actually available to go you buy the tickets. \n\nThere is also the possibility that she lost the voucher and didn\u2019t want to tell you because you\u2019d already spent money on it.

I decided to give her a voucher for a private alpaca hike as a present. We all like animals but I also thought it would be a good opportunity for some family time, maybe including our parents and her kids.  \nOver time, I've asked her every few months if she had some plans already, not to push her to do it but simply for planning reasons, so I wouldn't be on vacation then or something. She was always dismissive of the idea, not directly saying she didn't wanna do it but always like \"I don't wanna think about it right now, we'll have to see ...\" giving off the vibe that she was a bit annoyed by the inquiry and not keen on doing it at all, so I left it at that.  \nThe time passed and nothing ever came of it. I recently noticed that the voucher would expire at the end of this year and I didn't want it to go to waste, as it a) would have been sad but also b) the hike was fully prepaid, non-refundable and not that cheap (200\u20ac) because it is exclusive to the group with a dedicated guide.  \nA few days ago, I thus texted my sister via WhatsApp, saying:  \n\"Hey, how are you and the kids? How is it going? Just a quick question: do you already have some plans for the alpaca hike? I noticed that the voucher expires by the end of the year and it would be a shame if it would expire unused, also as it was somewhat pricey. Do you wanna do it? If not I would also take the voucher and go in your place. Have a nice day!\"  \nI didn't receive any answer whatsoever. Today I saw her at an unrelated family gathering. Towards the end I asked her \"did you read my message?\" she was like \"yea ...\" and I responded \"and you didn't wanna reply or ...?\". She said \"No it wouldn't have been nice ...\". Then I took her aside and asked what the problem was.  \nShe then started to quietly yell at me that it was totally disrespectful to watch so closely what happened to the gift and that she would never \"ask for a present back\", especially in that \"demanding tone of mine\", being extremely pissy about it. I went ahead and explained that it was really not my intent to upset her, that I thought she maybe had forgotten about it in the stress with the kids and all, and that it wasn't an allegation or criticism. Also I reiterated that I by no means am asking for anything back, I'm just offering to jump in to prevent the voucher from expiring unused if she didn't wanna go.  \nShe wouldn't have any of it, insisted that it was \"totally weird and inappropriate\" and that it wasn't my business what happened with her presents. She then explained that I \"don't need to worry about it\" as she would do it but without me and that she wouldn't talk about it anymore. I'm pretty sure that she wouldn't have done it at all if I hadn't said something and the main reason she's now doing it is spite.  \nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Even if it wasn't the event itself that excited her, it could have been a good reason to spend some time with the family, which was part of the idea. Not to demand that she does it, but to give her the option if she should choose to so so. Don't really see what's wrong with that.", "I get your point. It is well possible that she regifted it. That actually would have been fine so it's not wasted. But wouldn't the respectful thing to do then have been saying \"listen, thanks for the gift but it really isn't my cup of tea. I gave it to xyz so it doesn't go to waste, she probably enjoys it more than I do.\"\n\nWould that have been too much to ask?", "Actually, OP said they asked about it three times a year for three years, so nine times!", "The analogy is wrong. The bottle of wine doesn't expire if it isn't being drunk, it only gets better and appreciates in value. The voucher doesn't. It become useless after it expires and looses its entire value.

For example, I once gifted a wine tour to a close friend.  Instead of making any arrangements, I let her know, \"I want to pay for you and your husband to go on this wine tour.  Please let me know whenever you want to go, and I will purchase the tickets for you\". Then, I left it alone and waited for her to decide when she wanted to go, which she did over a year later (busy working parents).\n\n***Note***: I only do this with people whom I have a very close relationship with so that they feel comfortable contacting me to \"cash in the gift\".  Also, I always accompany the promise of the experience with an actual gift (e.g., a bottle of wine for the friend above).  \n\nThe beauty of this is that: 1) they don't feel pressured to use it; and 2) if they don't use it, they still got an actual gift and I did not waste money on an unused experience (I have only done this with a few people and they all \"did the experience\").\n\nI have also given people gift cards, but only if I know they will use it (e.g., a gift card to their favorite restaurant).", "NINE TIMES made me think of Ferris Bueller", "Saying the comment is valid is perceived as \"nah it's not like that\" by you?

Still I fell like a clear statement on her side could have easily prevented the argument.", "No, where does it say that? All I wanted is preventing the gift from becoming useless by letting the voucher expire. If she had given it to someone else who might enjoyed it, fine by me. I just didn't want the money going down the drain.", "So OP didn\u2019t say that it had to be with him, right?", "The alapaca one was the last one and it was in 2020, so yea ... may have been a while but yea I learned.", "Yea, that's noted. The last one was 3 years ago, so yea.", "How do you know for a fact it hasn\u2019t been used?\n\nAlso, you didn\u2019t really answer the question. You\u2019re saying you would have been completely fine with her giving away the gift and not cared at all? You wouldn\u2019t make any comments to the effect of her giving it to someone else?", "Look all I can do is assume based on the information you have given us, but from my view she probably didn't particularly want to do the tour. She probably liked the thought of a family vacation that she didn't have to plan or do anything for where all the people she loved were happy (in which case you not doing the planning, but deciding on the activity would be the worst parts). It's also possible that her regret was more about not wanting to do whatever her prior obligation was. Like if I can't go on a family vacation because I have to work, that sucks even if I'm not excited about the vacation.", "Maybe, but she clearly didn\u2019t think of it that way. And that\u2019s fine. \n\nI feel like basic understanding and emotional intelligence tells you that you ask someone about an event or experience like this twice and when they don\u2019t respond or are non-committal you take that as an answer and leave the ball in their court. That you didn\u2019t do that makes me wonder if this is a larger personality trait that your sister is responding to and not just this instance.", "I'm agreeing with the above comment but it sounds like something I've said to my brother before when he'd been banging on about doing something I wasn't really bothered about doing, I'd have only done it for him. He went with a new gf and invited me, 'oh shame I missed out sounds fun' lol\n\nBut I actually don't think you're an AH. I agree with a lot of the comments (was surprised at the y t as) initially but I think when it's someone so close to you and like an actual experience day you'd know if they'd done it and she hadn't brought it up so you asked about it. I think in reality most people would do that if the other person wasn't like look stop talking about it altogether (the sisters comment about I don't want to think about it now sounds like she meant she doesn't want to go nor talk about it) but she didn't communicate that, if that's the case.", "But if she wasn\u2019t really into in then you are a shitty gift giver. It doesn\u2019t matter how you feel about it, it\u2019s her gift.", "You didn't give her the option. You insisted. You asked every three or four months. Now you asked for it back. It's not yours. Leave it alone. It doesn't matter what she does with it. If it were me I'd frame it and leave it on my wall just to irritate you every time you see it, but I'm spiteful like that.", "Yes, she didn\u2019t owe you an explanation and you shouldn\u2019t expect one. Also the fact you made her gift about you (hounding her\u2026which yes you did, wanting to make sure it coincides with your dates so you don\u2019t miss it, asking for it back if it goes unused) sounds pretty selfish and like a burden for her/gift for you more than anything.", "This is not accurate at all. If she decided top pour the wine down the drain, that is up to her. A gift is freely given with zero strings attached. She has every right to pour it down the drain without saying anything to you.", "Listen, I understand why this bothers you, but the point people are trying to make is that it is viewed as uncouth to give a gift and then ask whether it's been used, or ask for it back, no matter what it is.\n\nPerhaps giving vouchers and/or gift cards that expire isn't something that really works for you, because there's always a chance that it will get forgotten, go unused or not be valued as much as you want. I agree with you that it's wasteful, but unfortunately, once you give a gift, you don't have control over that. \n\nYou've asked enough about it that it's gone from, how did you like it?, to it being rude.", "If you had not hounded her about it every 4 months for 3 years then it would not have been inappropriate to now be like \"hey, did you ever use that alpaca experience? I just noticed it is going to expire at the end of the year.\" But you literally asked her about a gift from three years ago 10 times. I'd much rather not receive a gift then be made uncomfortable by the giver hounding me. I'll go as far as to say that once you give it you shouldn't ask about it. Otherwise no one would ever feel comfortable return an ill-fitting  sweater they receive at Christmas, regifting things they can't use, etc. and it just makes for more clutter/more stuff in a landfill.\n\nThinking about it now I remember I bought my much younger sister a gift card to do indoor skydiving for 2 when she was in high school. It was expensive for me at the time, but something I thought she'd enjoy. That was 8ish years ago and I have no idea if she ever used it. Doubtful, because I feel like she prob would have sent pics or something when she did. But I don't know for sure because I NEVER BOTHERED HER ABOUT IT.

When we give gifts, we'd like to think that the person will be excited and follow-up with us (e.g., \"we went on that alpaca hike and it was awesome\", or even \"that sweater you got me is so soft\"), but they are not required to do so.
