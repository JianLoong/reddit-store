I can PROMISE you, you're NOT going to remember a damned thing that happens in the ceremony even if you write every word yourself.  Let her have this, because if you start out your marriage by refusing to be sensitive to her cultural and linguistic heritage, you're starting off on completely the wrong foot.  \n\n\nBut you need the interpreter for everyone that does not speak Spanish, not just yourself.", "Random idea, maybe learn the language of the person you are marrying?

If you don't love them enough to learn their language, should you really be marrying them? \n\nYTA", "YTA, it sounds like a bilingual ceremony. I dont see any reason why the ceremony should be monolingual. As long as the BIL is either prepared to translate on the fly (very difficult) or prepared with the material the officiante will say, he should be able to duplicate everything the officiant is saying. If individuals from each side participate, some speeches need to be translated, and others can be written in the program without repeating them outloud. Make sure to have a second microphone for BIL.", "He will, there will be a translation", "OP literally said there will be translation", "Is there literally anything that can be spoken during the ceremony that would alter the legal meaning of the written marriage certificate provided by the state?", "This is stupid.    \n\n\nThe marriage ceremony has zero to do with the legal contract (which is not a contract, it's a license).  They are completely separated - you can do either without the other.  Yes, yes, yes, you can tell me that \"in my heritage, it's a contract\" - I'm aware that some religious traditions still have a contract.  But the vast majority of people do not have a contract at marriage, and even for those that do, that \"contract\" is not a legally binding one.", "I've attended a bilingual wedding, fully translated.  It was long and dreary, but it happened.", "You don't expect the dead or god to answer anything.", "What is an officiant in Wedding?", "Is that true about the spoken part?  Or just the paperwork ?", "He has more chance of remembering it if he understands it. And why is he the only one that has to be sensitive to her culture and linguistic background?? What about his?? It\u2019s a marriage. Not just a wedding.", "There is a difference between conversational language learning and legal jargon language\u2026 it is possible he speaks well enough to get by, but this is a bit different\u2026", "Not ideal especially if the bride's brother is translating for the groom.  In any case, the best situation is if the service is in English, and the brother translates into Spanish for the family.", "He wants to understand what the actual person conducting the ceremony is saying at the time they are saying it. That isn\u2019t unreasonable. Also, translation has room for error. I would not be comfortable with this either. They are entering into a legally binding contract. He needs to understand what is being said.", "Here, the marriage licence needs to come before getting married, just getting that doesn't mean the couple is legally married. \n\nA ceremony of some sort is needed. It can be small, but requires someone legally able to perform the marriage plus 2 witnesses - so at minimum 5 people need to be present. The ceremony is part of the legal process of getting married and the signing of the registry is a part of that.", "I got married in Spain and the ceremony did have a legal contract when I signed the marriage certificate. To end the marriage would require a full divorce so how can it have no legal element?", "Getting married is very much a legal contract - regardless of which country a couple gets married.  And religion now (in this modern day) has nothing to do with it.  The priest or whoever the church leader is - requires by law to be registered to preform marriages.\n\nSigning the wedding certificate and all the related paperwork is legal.\n\nYou better get off that high horse before you fall off.", "This is stupid. A marriage license is the document obtained *before* getting married. When you marry you get a marriage certificate. This is a legally binding document, with far reaching legal implications. And if you do sign a marriage contract too, which is common in many countries, this is binding too, like any other contract. There\u2019s no such thing as a non binding contract.", "Yes this.  Is there anything that could be spoken during the ceremony that would impact the terms of the written legal marriage certificate?", ">The marriage ceremony has zero to do with the legal contract (which is not a contract, it's a license). They are completely separated \n\n\nDepends where they are eg in the UK the marriage ceremony in church is legally binding, the couple sign the marriage registry as part of the wedding ceremony.", "Funerals are for the living, so is mass and weddings. Must\u2019ve missed the memo you got, haven\u2019t heard a dead person say \u201cthat was a heck of a service\u201d.", "Person performing the wedding. He got ordained or approved or something.", "I've never encountered any \"legal jargon\" in a wedding.", "Let me guess, american?", "What country are you talking about here?", "Yes, in the US, you obtain the paper license, you have some kind of ceremony, then you sign the paper with the officiant and witnesses.  \n\n\nBut there are NO requirements to the ceremony.  If you don't actually have a ceremony, no one will ever know.  It is not a contract, and even if your religious tradition has a contract during the ceremony, that process DOES NOT become part of the legal marriage framework.  The law of contract does not apply to the law of marriage.  \n\n\nAnd before someone tries to say \"but prenuptial agreements are contracts\" - sure, the court will honor a contract related to the relationship.  But no one is going over the terms of their prenup in the marriage ceremony.  So again, the idea that you need to understand the ceremony because it's part of a contract- that's just hogwash.", "Yeah, but in Spain you can't have a rando marry you in any language you want, it has to be someone with the legal authority to do it, and in one of the official languages of the country. Plus the actual contractual conditions, such as if you're combining finances or keeping everything separate, are filled months beforehand when you go to the registry to put in the paperwork and have it signed before witnesses. You do sign the certificate at the ceremony but it's just a ratification of the actual important matters that you already presented at the registry.", "Interesting. In my country that must be a government approved official ( but they are like employed by the government). \n\nOnce I was at the ceremony where bride and groom were from different countries and there was an official translator as well so it was in two languages.", "There are a alot of terms you might not use in common speech\u2026 whosoever has a problem speak now or forever hold your peace yada yada is a bit different from daily conversation", "English actually not that it should matter??", "Nationality has got nothing to do with it.  Both bride and groom have a legal right to understand their vows.  And as far as OP knows, they can be agreeing to handing over their bank account details, passwords and pay in the ceremony and the translator (the bride's brother) doesn't say that in English.", ">But there are NO requirements to the ceremony.

It is not a contract, and even if your religious tradition has a contract during the ceremony, that process DOES NOT become part of the legal marriage framework.  The law of contract does not apply to the law of marriage.\n\nNow it's my turn to say \"this is stupid\".  Here in Australia - there is very much legal requirements for the ceremony.  There are certain words which the couple are to say to each other to make it legal.  And there is a requirement for a ceremony, even if it's just the celebrant, the couple, and two witnesses.  This can be done anywhere, in your bedroom, in the park, backyard, anywhere.  And the wedding certificate is signed by everyone and then the celebrant registers it afterwards.", "There most definitely are legal requirements to the ceremony. For example with regard to witnesses. If you don\u2019t meet these requirements you\u2019re marriage certificate won\u2019t be registered and you won\u2019t be legally married. The marriage certificate is legally binding and has huge legal implications.", "But those are phrases he could learn specifically if he really wanted to", "You\u2019d like to think you\u2019d trust your future spouse not to do that if you\u2019re going to marry them, you need to get out more", "Yeah, this is the case here in the US, too.  Fundamentally, that *is* the ceremony.  The fact that it's often significantly expanded from that doesn't change that what they keep claiming is somehow separate from the ceremony is the ceremony itself.", "A witness is not a requirement to the ceremony.  It is a meta-requirement - someone must say they observed, but there is nothing in particular which they must observe.  What I CLEARLY meant is that there are no legally operative words, no promises which must be made,etc.  There are NO such particular requirements in the United States anyway.  I am very rarely willing to say this - but I highly suspect there are none in any state.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNothing particular happens in the ceremony which has any legal impact.  That is the essence of the claim I was disputing and your ridiculously contrarian objections notwithstanding, that is the absolute truth.", "Thanks so much for this.  I didn't think the American legal system in regard to weddings was that much different to the Australian system.  If we drag the ceremony down to the bare basics, it can be done, all over, in less than 15 / 20 minutes.  But it is considered a ceremony.", "This *is* the ceremony.  The part where you have an officiant recognized by the state and 2 witnesses and you all sign the legal documents which the officiant files with the state.  That's it.  It isn't separate from a ceremony, it *is* the ceremony, at its most basic, stripped down level.  It doesn't have to be some big formal extravagant affair, but yes, that ceremony is a requirement.", "Wow.  So argumentative.  None of which makes any sense.", "That\u2019s just not true. The pair, the officiant and (most often) the witnesses must sign the marriage certificate. In those cases the witnesses aren\u2019t required to sign they are required to witness the couple signing. The only exemption I know is Virginia. You\u2019re also death wrong on it not being a contract or even legally binding. If you don\u2019t believe me read the bar information of, for example, New York (or any other state except for Virginia): https://www.nycbar.org/get-legal-help/article/family-law/marriage-is-a-contract/\n\nOf course you can get legally married at the court house and than have an unofficial \u201cceremony\u201d elsewhere without any legal proceedings, but that\u2019s not what OP is talking about."]}
