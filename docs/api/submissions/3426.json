If they have financial issues they could have 1.) not gone to McDonalds but made inexpensive food at home, or 2.) told you to please send $ for your child for McDonalds.  Instead they chose to deny her food & make fun of her.  To call them the A is an insult to A.  They're slime.", "NTA - I\u2019m prepared to be downvoted but my parents used to make sure I had cash in case we are out at a sleepover. It wasn\u2019t always accepted but it was always offered. I can understand you not thinking about it before hand and I can understand the other kids parents having the expectation that if they went out to eat your kid would be able to pay for herself. Unless the parents were rude about it or something I think it could just be an honest mistake or miscommunication.\n\nEdited to change to NTA I missed the part in the post where the parents where making fun of a child for not having food! I had originally read it as 14 yr olds being brats to each other which should be shut down by parents but a drive through with a bunch of children in the car can be hectic and I try to give people the benefit of the doubt.", "NAH \n\nI think definitely inconsiderate. I didnt think about money but I was more thinking about certain houserules where theres no unhealthy food etc. But I dont think qualifies as AH if you REALLY feel like u need to feed your daughter Mac.", "I would also ask some careful questions of your child. If she \"ran to you\" there might have been more going on. Being upset/humiliated is enough for some child to literally run to their parents, but not all. And if they refused to buy her food at McDonald's, after inviting her over, and laughed about it... What else happened/happens at their house? Who else doesn't get McDonald's and laughed at for it?", "NTA. If you can\u2019t afford to feed a child, don\u2019t invite a child over for a sleepover.

That\u2019s a special kind of cruel.", "And I mean, my mom definitely took us kids and our friends to McDonald\u2019s on a budget. \n\nShe\u2019s say \u201chey kids, I\u2019m on a budget so we\u2019re ordering off the dollar menu\u201d and we\u2019d all get McDoubles or the other cheaper items \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I've never had kids of my own, unfortunately. However, if I were staying over at someone else's place, the expectation would be that I'd be fed there (and the same if anyone stayed at ours).  \n\n\nMy parents and our neighbours were all living on budget - all the fathers were coalminers - but there's no way that a child would have gone hungry, particularly when the child was an invited guest.   \n\n\nIf the plan was to stop over at a cafe, then our mums would all have made certain that we had spending money (or would have made an excuse to decline if that were a problem).   \n\n\nMy mum and dad would have gone hungry themselves, rather than fail to feed a guest. I know that for a fact...One time, we had a family wedding down in England - we lived in Central Scotland. My cousins were over from Canada. They stayed with us for most of their visit, but we all travelled down to Essex for the wedding and stayed with relatives.  \n\n\nMum and Dad took the cousins and me to the Tutankhamen Exhibition. (I think this was the summer of '72.) My parents bought souvenirs for the cousins, but not for me. (They couldn't afford it and guests came first.) Similarly, when we went to a restaurant afterwards, we all had a main meal, but only my cousins were offered dessert. My parents weren't cruel - they couldn't afford to pay extra for all 5 of us in a London restaurant, but they made sure that the guests were catered to.  \n\n\nSimilarly, if we had unexpected guests arriving at a mealtime at home, Mum would say that she'd get her meal later...It was what you did when there wasn't enough money to go round.   \n\n\nMaybe there was some kind of a class difference. I recall there being a discussion about this at school one time and better off kids in my class saying that there would be no way they'd do without their meal to let a guest get fed.", "This is my level of petty too! I've done it twice for my daughter. First was fifth grade field day, friend said grandma was bringing friend group subway for lunch. Day of- friend group was ignoring her and grandma brought subway for all but my daughter. (4 or 5 girls) her whole class got an impromptu pizza party from yours truly. Second time was her 8th grade dance. She had made plans with some friends, they decided she could no longer go with them bc they had dates now and she didn't. My daughter and about 15 other dateless kids got a party bus, group pics with a parent volunteer photographer, and dinner at a local restaurant. (Way overboard for an 8th grade dance, but I'm petty so...)", "Exactly- a couple boxes of pasta and some sauce would feed everyone for less than the price of one McD\u2019s combo meal.

OP you are NTA and if they couldn\u2019t or even just didn\u2019t want to pay for your daughter they could have asked you to send her with food or money to get her own food. I\u2019d often go to sleep overs with 5-10 bucks to help order pizza or get snacks. Laughing at a hungry kid is just weird and cruel.\n\nIf you get any more info please share, my brain is having a hard time understanding why anyone would treat your kid this way and not expect you to help her. My curiosity is killing me.", "For real though, this was the easiest solution other than being a dick to a kid. Like this is exactly what we did when I went to my friend\u2019s house and they were tight on money. My mom or grandpa sent me with money to go rollerskating or whatever we were gonna do.", "THIS! \n\nThere is nothing wrong with being on a budget and going to McDonald's or hosting a sleepover, it's ok to ask other parents to send money for activities.\n\nOP is 100% NTA", "Agreed! I hope OP knew they were leaving the house also before she dropped off her daughter. I would be pissed if I dropped my daughter off for a sleepover and then got a call from her in McDonald's drive thru not knowing they were going anywhere. When my kids have sleepovers, if we were going somewhere the parents knew about it at the time of the invite.", "Well no, if they're too poor to feed the kid they can tell her parents as much and ask for them to give her money to bring along for food and what food they plan to get.", "Or you do what I did, and skipped dinner myself so ALL the kids could have something. Either way, you FEED KIDS IN YOUR CARE.  PERIOD. You don't know what their home life is like, so you feed everybody.", "Ok... So they're both stupid cheap and unhealthy?\n\nWhich is fine for a sleepover...I guess my point is either way, they should have provided for all the kids.\n\nWe definitely cannot get grocery store pizzas that cheap in the US.  Our local grocery here in Kansas does very good take & bake pizzas for $7 which I've always thought was a really good deal.  Good large pizzas with plenty of toppings...", "Agreed, definitely still cheap options.
