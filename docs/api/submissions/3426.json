When it was dinner time they told us they were going to grill outside, they set the table and it was around 6pm in the afternoon. Summernight, lovely evening.

I was really hungry but was to shy to say anything.. later that night the parents called us down to the kitchen and I was told that my friend was going to have a late night snack and I could wait in her room again.. by this time I was super hungry (9 pm ) and haven\u2019t eating anything since breakfast. I remember trying to say that I was hungry and the mother just looked at me and said \u201cdid you not eat before you came here? You can eat when you get home tomorrow\u201d\n\nI went back to my friends room and called my mom and told her what happened. This was such a weird thing. Because when I had friends over, my mom would never let anyone leave hungry. And if somebody stayed over it was more of my mom trying to make my friends favorite food and snacks. And Everyone I went to did the same thing, you give your guest food, especially if they are staying the night.. My mom was so weirded out by this that she faked a reason for me to come home. Since it was my moms coworker she did not what do make a big thing out of this and I agreed with her since I went to school with my friend as well. My mom came and picked me up.

My best friend growing up had parents who would punish her by denying her food, clothes, a not 100yr old mattress\u2026 she stayed at our house as often as possible and always slept in my bed and was fed by us and I am weary of sleepovers too for this and other reasons. I\u2019m actually glad your daughter still talks to her because who knows how they treat her.. them getting her food and not your daughter could literally be something for them to say to her later when they won\u2019t give her food saying how it was so special they got her food but not her friend or some fucked up shit.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, they were abusing your daughter.

But at no time did they offer her any food or drink other than water. \n\nAt 9:30 at night my daughter called me crying. She was extremely hungry. I was shocked. I had always made sure to offer their daughter something at my house. I immediately went and took her home.

And guess what... if my friends ever stayed over... they were ALWAYS fed. These people are NOT poor. They are child abusers.", "Exactly. We had extra tickets to a theme park and brought our kids friends. Money was tight, so we all took a trip to the grocery store to pick out our lunch rather than eat there.
