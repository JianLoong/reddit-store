They didn't. NTA.", "OBVIOUSLY NTA.\n\nBy the way, your daughter RAN to you, meaning that she wasn\u2019t feeling good with those people.", "NTA....And then I would have went into McDs and ordered a whole bunch of value meals and desserts then called some REAL friends or some cousins or whatever over and had an all night binge movie fest and let her brag about it at school in front of this kid (yeah I'm petty).", "NTA\n\nYou saved your daughter from humiliation and likely not having a meal that night. How could they go out for fast food and not spot your daughter one meal then let you know in the morning when you picked her up? They even laughed at your daughter not being able to get anything. The adults sound like bullies.\n\nI\u2019m glad your daughter texted you and you didn\u2019t hesitate- she won\u2019t forget how you showed up for her. I\u2019m amused by their surprise when you rolled up to that McD\u2019s to essentially rescue your daughter from that situation. What the hell did they think was going to happen?", "NTA \n\nWho actually goes for food and doesn't get the kid with them anything....That's just horrible...", "Nta", "NTA.\n\nDon't let whoever is telling you otherwise convince you that were in the wrong. If this had been a matter of budget then any decent human being would have been humiliated and deeply apologetic. They would not have turned things around on your daughter and humiliated her instead. This was bullying, pure and simple, and kudos to you for putting an end to it.", "NTA. Your daughter contacted you because she was uncomfortable in the care of other adults. She ran to you, obviously wanting to be extracted from the situation. Your first duty is to your child. You absolutely did the right thing.", "NTA they are bullies and any parent that would do that to another child shouldn't be trusted with someone else's child. You did the right thing.", "NTA. Honestly, if you are on a budget so tight you can't afford to feed your daugther's friend, either you don't invite her to the sleepover, either you just.... maybe... just maybe... don't go to McDonald's ?!?!\n\nThose people are mean. I am glad you were there for your kid.", "NTA: They clearly invited her to bully her, you responded in the most appropriate way possible-- showing your daughter you believe her when she asks for help and showing up to back her up. That's why when you showed up, she ran to you.  Good man.\n\nEdit: really hope the point of the adults wasn't to destroy her friend's friendship with her and cut off the other kid. Ask your daughter how her relationship with that kid really is.", "NTA\n\nIf they were so dirt poor they couldn't afford a macdonald meal they should have told you. Asshole parents. I was poor as a kid and yet my parents always had something to offer to friends the few times I would have them over. Not even sharing the food? Just cut contacts", "NTA. If they were on a budget enough to not be able to treat her, don't bring her in the first place.", "NTA.  Their financial situation is not your concern.  Your daughter is.  I doubt this is the case otherwise they wouldn't be at McDonald's purchasing food for everyone else but  your child.", "NTA it sounds more like they were just being cruel rather than being on a budget. You don't take a kid somewhere and get everyone else food except that child, laugh about it and then expect pity because you \"have a budget\". That's just cruel and they are bullies", "NTA", "NTA!! They were *deliberately* humiliating and excluding your daughter, no amount of money you could have given them would have fixed that! Anyone who's telling you that you might be the asshole here is unfathomable... I would starve before I let a kid in my care go hungry.", "NTA. There\u2019s an expectation that when you have people over, your kids friends, you\u2019re able to provide for them for the time being. **Or** you agree on payment etc. beforehand.", "You and your daughter were both smart. She felt uncomfortable and called for help and you were smart to drive over and get her. She\u2019s lucky she knows she can count on you, and that you were there for her when she needed.", "Never heard of that popular sleepover game called starve your guests?/s NTA", "NTA, if your kid has a sleepover you either inform the parents that money will be required for a planned activity, or you pay for it yourself. You don't just refuse to feed a child who is in your care for the night and then laugh about it.", "NTA - The whole family is complete trash. If they were too poor to feed a kid then they don\u2019t need to host sleepovers. Make every effort to keep your daughter from them in the future.

I\u2019ve been in this situation and spotted a meal that wasn\u2019t planned or called in my credit card to pay for one. Kids that age plan erratically and don\u2019t fully communicate.

Do you think their daughter or other children are being denied food?\n\nIt sounds like this is a behavior or punishment they may use on their current children.  This is abuse and many children go without eating.  Sometimes their only meal is at school.", "McDonald's is expensive, if they had enough money to buy McDonald's for others they had plenty to buy some frozen party food.", "NTA. If they\u2019re on a budget, then no one should be at McDonald\u2019s. If they\u2019re on a budget, they should not have agreed to take in someone else\u2019s child for a sleepover.", "NTA. I have a rule with my son\u2019s friends (their parents are totally cool with it) if they are with me they will be treated like my own child(ren).

I mean they could have told you at pickup asking for repayment or when she called asked you to Venmo money really quick. Instead they were perfectly happy to sit there eating in front of her laughing while she had nothing.", "Nta at all!!!", "NTA. The very fact that they were laughing about it shows this was not financial, this was bullying her and you did the right thing.", "You are completely right. There might some kind of jealousy and bullying that your daughter is too young to process.", "**NTA** \n\nYour daughter is lucky you were there to rescue her. \n\nWhomever is telling you that *being on a budget* gives someone the right to take a guest to McDonalds, buy food only for themselves and laugh at her, is out of their minds.", "NTA", "NTA, and 'budget' is a completely bullshit answer.

Being on a budget is fine,  being complete jerks towards your daughter is just rude.   I'm glad you went and got her and showed her that you will not allow people to treat her that way.", "Nta you did what any good parent would do and protected your daughter. Nothing about laughing at a kid not eating is ok. You're a good mom tell the people who say you were wrong to kick rocks. You did exactly what she needed you to do.", "NTA\nI once read that in many countries in Northern Europe it is not customary to feed a guest even when you are eating.  However, I doubt that it is customary to laugh at a hungry child.\nRegardless , even if it is not expected of them to feed her, you are definitely NTA for coming to get your hungry child.", "NTA if they are \u201con a budget\u201d they could have made a meal for everyone at home cheaper.", "They couldn't afford to buy her McDonald's and they bullied her about it? How embarrassing for them. NTA.", "NTA - By inviting her to a sleepover, they agreed to care for her.

You don't let one kid watch the other eat while getting nothing if it was a money thing they could have mentioned it before hand", "NTA.

They shouldn\u2019t of gone to McDonald\u2019s if they couldn\u2019t afford to feed the child they had with them. As a parent if I invite a child somewhere then that means I pay for things.
