It\u2019s not unheard of either.", "I\u2019ve only let her have sleepovers with cousins or my bestfriend  house, (kids are the same age and we raised them together since birth) so I trust her, usually I don\u2019t let my daughter sleepover anyone else\u2019s , look like I got reminded why, what I get for trying to go against my gut \ud83d\ude44", "Yeah this is a crazy weird situation that seems like some type of bullying and I would want to know how long it has been going on and in what other ways it manifests.", "I was actually wondering if it could warrant a call to CPS.\n\nThough that might be more trouble than its worth with all the horror stories surrounding CPS.", "Still I had friends' parents basically do this.  We'd have to beg to be allowed to SPLIT a frozen burrito.  We were 13.\n\nMom and dad fed themselves to obesity. (Like ordering 2 pizzas for the family of 4. Kids wait until mom and dad finish the first, then all 4 split the second. But you don't get more than one slice of Mom and dad are still hungry.)\n\nIt's no wonder that when I got older I realized that both kids had eating disorders.", "A McChicken is $1 in the states?!? A McChicken is $5.89+tax (14%) in Canada and that isn\u2019t even for the meal, just the sandwich.", "They wanted to feel superior by all of them I\u2019ll treating a child and their daughter to feel above others on her stupid birthday. Absolute lowlifes!", "Nobody ever said that??\n\n1. Friendships don't require sleepovers. \n\n2. Being poor doesn't excuse cruel behavior. Being poor doesn't make you bring a child to McDonald's so you can laugh in their face about not feeding them. That's malicious behavior.\n\n3. There were a lot of ways for this situation to be resolved with compassion (such as asking op to bring snacks for her daughter) and the fact that the parent's decided to taunt her tells me that they probably are not actually poor/on a tight budget. That was a suggestion someone unrelated to the situation made. We don't know their financial situation.", " I was thinking maybe some where older and did drive themself so it was conflict between the children, the situation is different if the parents where there they should just pay and clear it afterwards with you, don't  buy her anything and laugh is insane,  but in first place they should have clear it ahead that they even gonna go you have to know where your child is in case of emergency.  NTA", "You\u2019re a good mom for picking her up and not letting her spend anymore more time with the people who laughed while she\u2019d go hungry", "Good Mum!  Yeah  if they can laugh about her hunger , what can they do more  and what are doing to their own kids. Scary stuff.", "I think you did great. She had a cell phone right? It worked exactly as it should have. \n\nI should add, my kid is 7. Very different situation. I didn't mean to come off as judgemental.", "By itself no, not enough to call CPS in my opinion. And you don't want to make things worse by asking leading questions to a child for what might just be a really awful one time experience. But asking generally about how things went before McDonalds or about what things are like when they've spent time at the people's house before and how everyone was treated at the house, would hopefully give OP enough information to know if something more than removing their own child, is necessary. This is a worrisome, but may not be indicative of how they treat their own children or general behavior. Sadly, some people treat people outside their own family (even children) worse than their own. But the opposite is also true, so open eyes and ears are definitely warranted. Also, OP definitely has the right to contact them and demand an explaination for the situation and their child's treatment during an invited sleepover.", " I am glad you were there for your kid.", "it varies by state and location. mcdonalds menu pricing is not static, and each physical store is actually a franchise licensed by a franchise holder. the franchise holder sets the pricing based on the region's economic statistics ie the average wages of the people in the area.\n\nfor instance, a mcchicken in my town is 2 dollars, but a mcchicken in the city 40 miles away is 4 dollars. they charge more in areas where they can get more. in some places they have to lower prices or they simply woudln't get sales as nobody would eat there.", "a US McChicken is like a CA Junior Chicken, as opposed to the CA McChicken or McCrispy", "Yep!! My daughter went to a birthday party that was swimming and McDonalds and I asked the mum if she needed any money for it. She said she was paying for Happy Meals but if she wanted anything else then yes. I thanked her, we stayed at McDonalds anyway (you tell a 9yo his sister is getting McDs and he isn't lol), spent some time getting to know the parents of her new friends and got some birthday cake for our troubles.\nWe were the only people who asked AND who stayed.\n\nIf you can't afford it for everyone, nobody gets it.", "I was thinking this, when my son wanted a friend to come with us on an outing, I let his folks know we were going to grabbing lunch out, they said \"great, we'll give him some lunch money\"...we paid for his lunch of course because we invited him, so he could use his money for an extra drink or in the gift shop. I would never dream if inviting a child out/over and not feeding them x", "Exactly. Or you say, \"We're having a sleepover, please bring a snack to share!\" If you can't afford to feed everyone, just make it clear up front how food will be handled.", "Oh no it was two children (mine and theirs) both are 14", "No your fine, I don\u2019t like sleepovers either, for this exact reason much can go wrong.", "I mean it doesn\u2019t matter. She was in their care for the night. It was their responsibility to feed her.", "It's literally called the $1,$2,$3 menu now.", "That makes more sense. Although I\u2019m still jealous, a jr chicken is over $3 plus tax.", "That\u2019s a good idea as well.", "Our $1,2,3 value menu has four items all are $2.39+", "Niiice.

Around $10 or more. Not that you have to go with the pricier pizza, but there's cost differences here.", "I'm lucky if i can get a frozen pizza for less than $10, and they aren't even \"luxurious\". Unless you mean those little mini single-serve pizzas?", "It's different. All those companies are providing me a service that I signed up for and while I thinking tracking is bad, there is an actual business purpose to it.\n\nCredit Cards = Credit Reports, Fraud, etc\n\nUtility Company = Tracking usage for billing, forecasting future peak usages, etc\n\nCell Phone = GPS and other Location services\n\nWhat the fuck does McDonalds need my information for?", "Good idea, I will.

That cancels out ALL my burgers, trust me.\n\nSo which one is it?", "You aren't really wrong and the amount of people who have no concept of the potential consequences of letting corporations track us for $1 off fast food is disheartening.\n\nThat said, you're probably being downvoted more so for the way you articulated argument, which doesn't pair well with a username containing the word \"hippie.\"", "Thanks for giving me hope there are some sane people left.", "Why try?", "That's what I'm asking you, my dude.
