Dad married K 4 years later. K has a daughter E (22) from a previous relationship. K and E are easily the most entitled, spoil and rude people I've ever met. \n\nThey never treated me like family, K has done everything possible to push me away from the family. I haven't been in any family pictures since i was 14. I was never allowed on any family vacation/activities. Per K' request my dad banned any family members from giving me any gifts for my birthday/holidays. She always hated me. I can't even remember all the times i cried because of the things she would say to me.\n\nE was the favorite child. Whatever she wanted they would get it for her. Me? I had to work if i wanted something. School supplies? Work for them. My clothes don't fit me anymore? Work for new clothes. \n\nE liked to break my stuff and i would be grounded because i got mad at her. My last straw was when she cut all pictures i had of mom. Dad found me crying and when i showed him the pictures he told me to let it go.\n\nI packed a bag and when to stay with my grandparents. I was 17. Dad never came for me. Never called or texted me either. \n\nHe reached out to me when i was 20, apologised and said he wanted to reconnect. I told him if he wants that he will have to work very hard to earn a relationship with me since he hasn't been my dad since i was 12 and in 3 years i haven't heard from him at all. He said he'll do anything to be my dad again. Since then I've been LC  with him because i don't feel like he's putting enough work into our relationship.\n\nI finished college last year and he attended the ceremony and after that we spent the entire weekend together bonding. It was the first time i felt like i had a dad in almost 13 years.\n\nI wanted my dad to attend the wedding a guessed but i don't want K or E there. I talked to my dad about it and he was ok with attending as a guest (my grandpa will be walking me down the aisle) but he was really mad when i said i will not invite K and E. His reasoning is that they are his family so that makes them mine too and he doesn't want them to be excluded. He then said he will not attend if they aren't invited so i said \"ok. I guess then you won't attend my wedding and our relationship is over since you're choosing them over me again. It is my wedding and i don't want those disgusting people there. Please don't contact me again. Go be with your perfect little family and forget i exist. You have practice on that. Goodbye\" then i blocked his number. \n\nSome family members reached out to me and told me i should be the bigger person and maybe the wedding could be what's going to fix our relationship. My grandparents said that it's my big day and i shouldn't have people that make me uncomfortable there. J and his parents agree that i shouldn't invite people that hurt me just because they are legally considered family. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nUpdate\n\nThe situation has blown out of proportions. K' family has been blowing up my phone sending me death/rape threats and what's worse is that they have send the same threats to mu grandparents. I had a panic attack so bad when my grandma called me and told me so I'm currently that I'm currently in the hospital. J' mom is with me and J and his dad went to my hometown to bring my grandparents here because I'm honestly scared something may happen to them. \n\nI don't know what to do. This has turned into a nightmare. And before you suggest a restraining order, in my country they won't give you one unless they actually hurt you. J aunt has offer to have us move in with her across the country and as much as we love our life here we will accept her offer.\n\nEdit: a lot of people keep asking why K and E want to come to my wedding when they clearly hate me. I don't think they want to come. I think it's the fact that i don't want them there that makes them want to come. They're not used to being told no.\n\nEdit: I've had some comments saying i should expose their treats on social media and i think I'll do that + tag all of them. I can update after i do that if y'all what me to.\nThank you for all the comments and messages!", "created_utc": 1670548287, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zgif45/aita_for_not_inviting_my_step_mother_and_her/", "score": 2058, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA.", "NTA\n\nDad's got a lot of nerve after he's stepped aside and given free rein to SM/SS to treat OP horrendously, cutting up pictures of her mom, no presents ever and none from anyone else, had to earn even her school supplies. He had no rights to a damn thing from OP or her grandparents. Wish she could have moved in the grandparents sooner, and glad she has a caring fiance' and future MIL & FIL. \n\nDeath/Rape threats are serious. Dad should be ashamed for creating a situation that made this a response by adults to a young couple and their grandparents. Dad should be the one to address this dangerous behavior and end it.", "Holy cow. I can see all that based on the update!\n\nNo one should \u201cbe the better person\u201d to people who make no effort. \n\nWipe them completely", "I was thinking of the wedding out of \"Kill Bill\". I am so sorry that OP is having to deal with this level of insanity.", "My son had a stepmonster too. She treated him like he was just there to watch his siblings. My son is now grown 26 and his dad got divorced and she is almost completely out of his life except she still has his brothers that he loves and has a great relationship with. I have always said that if I see her and it's not his wedding or the birth of his child I'm going to finally confront her on how she treated him. I knew and had always said I would take his dad back to court because of how she treated him but he didn't want to hurt his dad and his dad didn't find out until a couple years ago but he has never told his dad what she did to him and I don't think he ever will. \nI'm so sorry they treated you that way and I wouldn't invite them either. You don't need people at your wedding that were mean and spiteful to you. I'm glad you went no contact with your dad because he is letting them do this to you and thinks it's OK. It's not and she cut you dead mom's pictures was an evil move I would have left too. Who needs people like that in your life. Op you deserve better and sound like an amazing women don't let them bring you down.", "don\u2019t let those monsters anywhere near your wedding. what a vile threesome they are. embrace your new life with your family that loves you \ud83d\udc95", "Start a journal in which you list - and possibly save - all threats and harassments from your father and stepfamily. That might be very useful one day.", "NTA.  YES post their threats in public, tag them all.  But what the hell is your DAD saying about all that?", "When people tell you to \"be the bigger person\" they are telling you that your fears and concerns and feelings aren't important because it makes them feel uncomfortable that you have those fears, concerns and feelings.  Stand your ground, block everyone you can and beef up security.  NTA.", "NTA. You invite people you want in your life to your wedding.", "NTA.\n\nOP, don't just call them out on social media: **call the police** \\- even if you can't get a restraining order, notifying them of the threats may help create a paper trail if the unthinkable happens.", "Wow that escalated quickly. NTA obviously. I, uh, really don't have any other advice other than when \"Death/Rape\" threats are involved I'd say get away from there unless you have private armed security.", "YTA. Your father let you down again. In keeping contact with him, after all the bullshit, you will devalue yourself.", "Don\u2019t give in to them. Your father is a dirt bag! I remarried and my husband is good to my son. He couldn\u2019t find a woman who could love his daughter or at least support her. Shame on him. Anyone who would threaten his daughter should be cut from his life.", "Are we just glossing over the \"Death/Rape\" threats here?", "Yes, exactly.  My sister used to be horrid to me and my parents would just tell me to ignore it because \u201cyou know what she\u2019s like\u201d.  At almost 30, I finally blew up and told them that that\u2019s no excuse, and that they were treating the symptoms and not the disease.  And that just because it\u2019s easier to tell me to ignore it than to address her behaviour didn\u2019t give them the right to emotionally manipulate me. Then I told them that I would either go LC or NC if they kept pressuring me to spend time with her (the whole thing started because we lived in the same city and they pushed me to meet up with her, even though I told them she was always awful and it wasn\u2019t pleasant spending time with her). And then I stopped speaking to them for a few weeks.\n\nThey finally took it to heart and started speaking to her about her behaviour.  It\u2019s gotten much better - not sure that her nature has changed but she has stopped being so horrid to me, so we can at least be civil.", "OP\u2019s SM exposure should absolutely say something like \u201cthese are the people Dad refused to come to my wedding without\u201d."]}
