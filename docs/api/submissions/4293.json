Dad married K 4 years later. K has a daughter E (22) from a previous relationship. K and E are easily the most entitled, spoil and rude people I've ever met. \n\nThey never treated me like family, K has done everything possible to push me away from the family. I haven't been in any family pictures since i was 14. I was never allowed on any family vacation/activities. Per K' request my dad banned any family members from giving me any gifts for my birthday/holidays. She always hated me. I can't even remember all the times i cried because of the things she would say to me.\n\nE was the favorite child. Whatever she wanted they would get it for her. Me? I had to work if i wanted something. School supplies? Work for them. My clothes don't fit me anymore? Work for new clothes. \n\nE liked to break my stuff and i would be grounded because i got mad at her. My last straw was when she cut all pictures i had of mom. Dad found me crying and when i showed him the pictures he told me to let it go.\n\nI packed a bag and when to stay with my grandparents. I was 17. Dad never came for me. Never called or texted me either. \n\nHe reached out to me when i was 20, apologised and said he wanted to reconnect. I told him if he wants that he will have to work very hard to earn a relationship with me since he hasn't been my dad since i was 12 and in 3 years i haven't heard from him at all. He said he'll do anything to be my dad again. Since then I've been LC  with him because i don't feel like he's putting enough work into our relationship.\n\nI finished college last year and he attended the ceremony and after that we spent the entire weekend together bonding. It was the first time i felt like i had a dad in almost 13 years.\n\nI wanted my dad to attend the wedding a guessed but i don't want K or E there. I talked to my dad about it and he was ok with attending as a guest (my grandpa will be walking me down the aisle) but he was really mad when i said i will not invite K and E. His reasoning is that they are his family so that makes them mine too and he doesn't want them to be excluded. He then said he will not attend if they aren't invited so i said \"ok. I guess then you won't attend my wedding and our relationship is over since you're choosing them over me again. It is my wedding and i don't want those disgusting people there. Please don't contact me again. Go be with your perfect little family and forget i exist. You have practice on that. Goodbye\" then i blocked his number. \n\nSome family members reached out to me and told me i should be the bigger person and maybe the wedding could be what's going to fix our relationship. My grandparents said that it's my big day and i shouldn't have people that make me uncomfortable there. J and his parents agree that i shouldn't invite people that hurt me just because they are legally considered family. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1670548287, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zgif45/aita_for_not_inviting_my_step_mother_and_her/", "score": 505, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Best of luck to you OP for your wedding day and creating your own nuclear family and stick with your very wise decision to not invite toxic people to a celebration of love, hope and new beginnings.", "Nta I like being tiny", "NTA. Wedding are not about anyone but you and your soon to be spouse. Stick to your guns here and remember, anyone telling you you should sacrifice your comfort and happiness on your wedding day doesn\u2019t give a fuck about you. This day is about you. Your father has shown you who he is, believe him.", "NTA\n\nYou are creating a new extended family who supports you. \n\nExcellent reply to the sperm donor. He needed a reality check badly.\n\nCongratulations on your wedding.\n\nEvery time cruel and malicious words came out their mouths it was an opportunity to change.\n\nEvery time they approached you with their atrocious behavior was a second chance that they squandered.\n\nThey had plenty of opportunities time and again before you moved out to work on their relationship with you. They didn't. Their loss.", "NTA- How does it go? If you're the best at digging holes, they give you a bigger shovel. Being the bigger person, putting up with it, has only been rewarded by giving you more to put up with and be the bigger person about. Inviting these people to your wedding will only result in further bad experiences for you to be told to 'let go' of. You do not owe anybody the chance to ruin your day.", "Your grandparents are great. If they are his parents (rather than your mom's), they're unbelievably great.", "He stood up for them so easily but never you. Even on your wedding day. He's still not even trying to be a father.", "NTA. Don\u2019t back down.", "NTA. If K and E are there they will do something to ruin your wedding.

Why would he allow you to be excluded when you are his family and therefore they should treat you right? Your dad has some major issues if he thinks it\u2019s appropriate to ask two people who made it their business to ruin your life and run you off to be invited to your wedding. Your dad made a very u fortunate choice for himself. Also, you are the bigger person. You left a horrible situation and not once did you do anything to them. I\u2019d honestly create a message to copy/paste to everyone on the dad\u2019s side of the family and send it to them telling them everything they\u2019ve done to you then block them. They can defend his ridiculousness to someone else. Also a wedding isn\u2019t a therapy session. It\u2019s about you and your fianc\u00e9 not about fixing family issues. Not the place nor time for \u201creconciliation\u201d.", "Nta you ARE being the bigger person by moving on and finding happiness. You aren't chasing them around demanding attention.

Don't invite those ppl. They will mess it up. Don't do it. Enjoy your day. And block the flying monkeys. They didn't live your experience or experience your heartbreaks.

Because that is the biggest pile of manure I've ever heard!\n\nNo, you do NOT have to be the \"bigger person\" by letting your \"father\" and his family walk all over you. No, it is NOT up to you to fix this. And I don't know what weddings these people have been to, but the ones I attend are about two people joining together, not some BS family reunion where abusers get forgiven.\n\nNTA, and stand firm!", "NTA. to be honest you should cut your asshole dad out of your life completely. he shouldn't be given the honor of walking you down the aisle or even be at the wedding because he failed you your whole life.", "NTA", "NTA. I had similar family dynamics to you: step mother and her three favoured daughters and me; also left when I was 17; also had my father ask to be part of my life again; also was disappointed by his constant choosing of his wife and step daughters over me. Like, I\u2019m not saying he can\u2019t do things for them or love them or whatever but it was always at my expense, so 10 years ago (which was probably 10 years too late for me putting up with their BS at the cost of my self esteem), I finally cut all contact and while it took me a good few years to heal, I\u2019m happier now.\n\nAll this to say, it\u2019s your day. It sounds like your father checked out a long time ago so now you get to do what you need to be happy. Best wishes for your wedding and I hope you have many happy years with your future spouse.", "I may sound mean and I'm sorry.. But if it was me I'd go NC with dad as well as the others. How can a father allow his child to be treated this way? How could any family member? I'm so sorry this happened.", "NTA that day is celebration don\u2019t let anyone take that away from you.

Total nc.", "Why do you have to be a bigger person?  Your wedding should be full of love. You should be surrounded by people whom you love and who love you back. I mean, isn\u2019t that what the day is all about?  You owe her, her daughter, and your dad nothing.  If she and her daughter show up on your wedding day, wouldn\u2019t that kind of put a damper on things?  Sounds like she might end up making the day about her and her daughter anyways. I just see a wedding full of stress and anxiety if they show up. Enjoy yourself. It\u2019s about you and your new husband. Not about pleasing anyone else. End of story.", "NTA, just be prepared for the possibility that he might try to show up anyway and possibly try to bring the wicked witches with him.", "NTA. The concept of \u201cbeing a bigger person\u201d is bullshit. All it means is that the \u201csmaller\u201d person refuses to behave appropriately and the group as a whole would rather sacrifice someone to \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d than confront bad behavior, demand accountability, and implement boundaries. Your relatives want you to suffer to make things easier on them. Do not allow it. Cut off the dead weight and enjoy your wedding. Congratulations.", "Well he\u2019s got a hide doesn\u2019t he. You have absolutely every right to deny those vile women to one of the most important days of your life. After everything they have done to you they don\u2019t deserve shit. Your \u201cfather\u201d isn\u2019t worth the breath. It is not up to you to fix the relationship- these people abused you for years!

Well this is just how I am, not putting up with crap. lol", "exactly it's so infuriating!", "So true! Why is it the younger person\u2019s task to accomplish? Why should the victim forgive or ignore how they were abused? On their wedding day!

Lowest fucking bar on the planet and they couldn't manage it, yanno?\n\nI'm sorry about your dad but you did the right thing. He has shown you where his (selfish and warped) priorities lie and his behaviour works only continue to hurt you or you kept him in your life.\n\nAs for the people who think your wedding should be the setting for a happily-after-ever-esque family patch-up, that's a very selfish thing to say about your wedding, especially with no sign of remorse from either of them in all these years.
