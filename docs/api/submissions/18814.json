I will not get into too many details as his death was very public with some national coverage, but needless to say it was a horrific event. My family now holds a yearly memorial for his children and wife who he left behind.\n\nWhile I wholly support his wife and children and feel terrible for them, he was a horrible person while he was alive. Not only was he verbally abusive and extremely controlling, but he also was a serial cheater who could not keep it in his pants. His cheating and abusive tendencies were more or less an open secret and most people did their best to avoid him at family gatherings. \n\nHowever, as soon as he passed it was like my entire family completely forgot who he was. He became a perfect martyr that everyone remembered fondly and I was scolded by my family anytime I would imply otherwise.\n\nWhile I always avoid these yearly memorials my mother and father have been attempting to guilt trip me into attending the next one and we ended up having a heated argument during a recent family gathering where my extended family was present. The fight began like this:\n\nMom: \u201cOP can you please come to uncle\u2019s memorial on (date)? You never attend any more and you need to be more supportive of your and aunt and cousins.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cMom I already told you I have an important meeting that night that I can\u2019t miss, I\u2019ll visit them next month when I\u2019m in town.\u201d\n\nMom: \u201cOP you are disrespecting your family and more importantly you are disrespecting your uncle. Every year that you\u2019re not present you are spitting on his legacy. You should be ashamed of yourself!\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cMom I already told you I can\u2019t come, please just drop it\u201d\n\nAt this point my mom starts crying and my father starts yelling at me.\n\nDad: \u201cOP I raised you to have more respect for you family what is wrong with you!?\u201d\n\nI have had this conversation with my parents yearly and it almost always ends with me apologizing to my mom and doing something special to make up it. I\u2019m not sure why but this particular year something in me just snapped.\n\nMe: \u201cI am tired of everyone in this family treating (uncle\u2019s name) like he was a good person. He was an asshole, and I\u2019m not sad he\u2019s gone! You want to talk about disrespecting his legacy? His legacy as an abusive husband and a serial cheater? Why does everyone in this fucking family pretend like he had even one good quality? All of you talked shit about him CONSTANTLY and said he didn\u2019t deserve his wife or kids. Luckily now he has neither, and his life insurance is paying for the kids college funds. Please explain to me how that isn\u2019t a happy ending!?\u201d\n\nAt this point my other uncles and aunts got up from the table to comfort my mother who was sobbing and I left before anyone could stop me. My younger family members agree with what I said but all my uncles and aunts think I was wrong for speaking about my dead uncle like that.

That's completely nuts. NTA.
