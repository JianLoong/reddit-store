I will not get into too many details as his death was very public with some national coverage, but needless to say it was a horrific event. My family now holds a yearly memorial for his children and wife who he left behind.\n\nWhile I wholly support his wife and children and feel terrible for them, he was a horrible person while he was alive. Not only was he verbally abusive and extremely controlling, but he also was a serial cheater who could not keep it in his pants. His cheating and abusive tendencies were more or less an open secret and most people did their best to avoid him at family gatherings. \n\nHowever, as soon as he passed it was like my entire family completely forgot who he was. He became a perfect martyr that everyone remembered fondly and I was scolded by my family anytime I would imply otherwise.\n\nWhile I always avoid these yearly memorials my mother and father have been attempting to guilt trip me into attending the next one and we ended up having a heated argument during a recent family gathering where my extended family was present.

I\u2019m not sure why but this particular year something in me just snapped.\n\nMe: \u201cI am tired of everyone in this family treating (uncle\u2019s name) like he was a good person. He was an asshole, and I\u2019m not sad he\u2019s gone! You want to talk about disrespecting his legacy? His legacy as an abusive husband and a serial cheater? Why does everyone in this fucking family pretend like he had even one good quality? All of you talked shit about him CONSTANTLY and said he didn\u2019t deserve his wife or kids. Luckily now he has neither, and his life insurance is paying for the kids college funds. Please explain to me how that isn\u2019t a happy ending!?\u201d\n\nAt this point my other uncles and aunts got up from the table to comfort my mother who was sobbing and I left before anyone could stop me.

I think the more rigid, principled people were the younger ones. I say that because it's easier for younger people to see people and events as either-or. I'm around the same age as OP fwiw.\n\nThe older generation, being older, have lived with and known the uncle for a very long time, essentially all of his life. OP hasn't known him nearly as long as his older family members. When you haven't known someone for a long time (or when you've known someone for a relatively short amount of them), anything you learn about them seems \"bigger\" and more of a reflection of their personality. To the older generation, they see the kid the uncle was who they grew up with, along with the teen, then young adult, the matured adult, etc. (using \"mature\" developmentally, not necessarily mentally because cheating is immature). The uncle was the brother of OP's mom. This is just my thought, but the older generation sees so much more of the uncle as someone who repeatedly cheated. I could easily see that they see his uncle as all of these other attributes they saw in him growing up, while also being a cheater. It seems like OP just seems him as a cheater.\n\nTo the older generation, there's way more to consider because people aren't black-and-white. The younger generation, who likely didn't get the chance to know him as in-depth, wouldn't see the same person. They'd see a cheater first, or similar, without the nuance and complexity of knowing his life as much. They'd know much less about him and anything that wasn't experienced with him firsthand, which would likely be the majority of his life, would've been told to them. The younger people in the family agreeing with OP even more msked me think that's what's going on. I mentioned my age earlier because I remember when younger (not that much younger but still! Lol), thinking bad personality traits about someone was more reflective of them than the good ones, and those negative traits were *THE* defining characteristic about them. I don't think the family would downplay or dismiss the uncle was a cheater, but that he's much more than that. Not much information is given about the uncle so no way of knowing other traits about him. But I believe the rest of the family know but just don't think bringing it up will help or change anything. Yes, they've all talked shit about him in the past about it, but they all already know and discussed it throughout the years. To them, they'd probably ironically be beating a dead horse.\n\nYeah I typed a lot just to respond about the generational thing lol but I highly doubt the older generation don't consider the cheating. I think they don't let their opinions boil down to him simply being a cheater. I don't think for one sec the older generation would continue this if he was, say, an arsonist, murderer physically abusive, etc.\n\nI agree for the most part that OP is NTA and his mom should've dropped trying to get him to go when he clearly doesn't want to and said it multiple times. I think OP is a little bit of an AH for how he snapped at his mom at the family gathering. Also for saying the death contributed towards a happy ending. Someone being a cheater is not reason for them to be dead. It's also not clearly not a happy ending for his mom who lost her brother then hearing her son say her brother's death was deserving (OP didn't say that, but that's the sentiment I got from reading that part).\n\nSorry I wasn't originally planning on typing this much, it just happened :)", "Bit difficult.

Some people feel you're not supposed to speak ill of the dead but I don't see why you have to pretend they were great either.", "NTA", "INFO: Why is there an annual memorial for your uncle?  Does your family have annual memorials for all deceased family members or was there something special about him?", "I've said this before on a previous post, but dying doesn't automatically make someone a good person. A dead asshole is still an asshole. I hate when people try to pretend otherwise.\n\nAnd I can bet you that some of the older generation of your family secretly agree with what you said, but it's not like they can come out and say it since it's \"not right to speak ill of the dead\". NTA. Many of them are thinking it, and by pushing you over and over again all this time, they forced you to say it out loud. They knew you were more stubborn and stuck on this. If they wanted your mouth shut, they should have sealed their own.", "They are worried you will tell the truth about them after they die. \n\nNta", "NTA", "NTA. Sounds like you tried for a long while to deflect and decline, but your family wouldn't take a simple 'no' for an answer.", "Intergenerational differences causing a breach in taboos. You were being polite but they kept pushing,again. Then tried to manipulate you,again. NTA", "NTA. Everyone has their own way of grieving, they should respect yours. Even if your choice is to stop grieving. Everyone has their own way of remembering,  they  should respect yours. Everyone has their own opinion and you are entitled to  yours. At the point where you make it clear that you don't want to take part, they should drop the subject. I personally feel that if this happened many years ago, the group mourning should stop. There comes a point where constantly going back to tragedy is like picking at  a scab. But that's just me and I know some family members will get great comfort from group remembrance.  Other family members just like the drama or a good get-together. You should, at this stage, be free to choose your response.", "NTA. The fact that they\u2019re holding yearly memorials and guilting people into attending is probably a symptom of his abuse. Those he hurt need professional help, not willing participants in a ritual that prolongs their pain.", "I am not sure I agree with this.\n\nBut to me, we don't speak ill of the dead means ypu don't well say mean thing about them.   It doesn't mean ypu have to say nice things about them.\n\nThat's why We never talk about my aunt late husband.", "We did for my uncle. He died in the night (like 2am) and we were there with my aunt and cousins. They\u2019d been with him all day and hadn\u2019t eaten so we took them to the only place open. Dennys. Then it just kind of became an annual event to go to dennys on the day he passed as a little remembered and a way to honor him with some Moons over Myhammy.", "OP didn't interfere with their personal reaction to it. They did with his. It is wild to me to see you say everyone's reaction to something like this is their own and just sympathize with the people who won't let people handle it their own way", "Saying the truth about someone is not talking ill of the dead.", "That is such an awesome book, the whole series is amazing really.\n\nBut yeah, with OSC pirating is really the way to go.", "If the deceased person behaved so badly that they deserve the mean things that are said about them, what is so awful about saying those things?\n\nAll we owe the dead is the truth.", "How many years ago was this?", "So they are being subjected every year to something they don't want. Being reminded every year of a version of a person that didn't exist and trying to heal from his abuse of them only to be prevented from moving on with their lives because of your family's annual martyrization of him? Holy cow, NTA.", "So this isn't  even for them?! What is up in your family?", "I can agree with that. Fair enough. I just didn\u2019t think of it that way. The way I though it went down was they are still grieving and OP is really pretty good to move on with life. So in my initial interpretation, OP wasn\u2019t grieving but the others are. That\u2019s why I said softly\u2026", "The timing isnt OPs fault though, thats entirely on the parents.", "Then we don't owe him respect.", "Petra failed and passed out from exhaustion because she was a women, he was very clear on that in Ender's Game.  \n\n\nIf you re-read the book with a critical eye you will see that his conservative morals crept in in absolutely terrible ways.  That whole scene literally hurt my heart as a young girl, that someone with such an interesting and seemingly deep story and moral lessons could not even see women as fully human.", "Yeah, but if you look back at the books - specifically at all the stuff in the Bean spin-offs where characters wax on about having children being the biggest possible deal - you can see where his underlying emotional issues bled through into the text.", "Well he does admit human are varelse. Himself first I guess.", "Makes me wonder if there's a part of them that wants to possess the virtues they talk about in their books but can't quite get there for one reason or another.", "But wait, the writing & his perceived views are conflicting, so which are a lie?"]}
