She can be a little sensitive to matters relating to sex and topics of that nature. \n\r\nNow my girlfriend Kate didn\u2019t want to hangout this weekend because she\u2019s on her period and had some bad cramps so she didn\u2019t want to do anything. Yesterday I told her I\u2019d drop by to bring her some food and snacks, she asked me to bring her some tampons because she was out, I said sure no problem. Now I didn\u2019t feel like paying a $1.50 for a reusable bag so I just carried it in my hand.\n\r\nI got to Kate\u2019s house and I rang the bell only for her mother to answer. She freaked out on me, she said I shouldn\u2019t be carrying something as sensitive and embarrassing as tampons out for the world to see, she didn\u2019t want her daughter embarrassed. Further she said that I was a man, and men shouldn\u2019t know about this kind of stuff, that it was private and that I probably got the wrong ones anyway.\r\nI told her that Kate FaceTimed me so that I could buy the exact ones she needed. She said that it still didn\u2019t matter, that I was beyond stupid for not putting them in a bag. I was mean mugging her the whole time, I rolled my eyes extremely hard and handed her the food and tampons. Kate came in by this point and walked me back to my car and saw me off.\n\r\nShe texted me later saying that while her mother was wrong for how she reacted and for treating me like crap and she\u2019d talk to her about it, I was rude to her mom and that I should have gotten a bag for the tampons.\n\r\nSo reddit am I am AH for being rude to her mom and not getting a bag for her tampons?", "created_utc": 1681762430, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pv3oy/aita_for_not_putting_my_girlfriends_tampons_in_a/", "score": 156, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her mother's attitude is just nuts.", "NTA - just because your MIL would be embarrassed doesn't mean your wife and the rest of the world should be. Your responsibility is to care for your wife, not care for your MILs insecurities.", "NTA. Quite the opposite.. being man enough to go get the tampons and to make sure it was the ones she wanted with food as bonus. Being a prude about hygiene supplies is the MILs own choice.", "INFO: How old are you both? You're NTA either way but if Kate is an adult living at home she needs to start setting serious boundaries with her mom. If you're both still teens, I cut Kate some slack for trying to minimize conflict with her mom, but eventually if she's going to be in a relationship she will need to start sticking up for her bf with her mom.", "NTA, and frankly your MIL's societal ideals are completely outdated, 50% of the worlds population needs some forms of tampons / pads and it's time we stop trying to hide that. Personally I think you should out of spite bring tampons to the house whenever needed w/o a bag just for your MIL to see.", "NTA but if Kate\u2019s relationship with her mother is a source of tension for her, it may be best for you to make some compromises not to add fuel to fire.

If it was your FIL being squeamish about tampons it would still be somewhat pathetic  but understandable for an older man. But for a woman, even an old and uptight one? FFS MIL get a grip! And you didn't even call her stupid, you only expressed it with your bodylanguage, which is both justified and subtle.", "NTA. Her mom was being weird and your gf was throwing you under this very small bus because she's used to picking fer battles I assume.

Sorry about her mom, she\u2019s old fashioned and just silly.

Just in case.", "What bs is this? Kate's mother has internalised a whole heap of misogyny, and it sounds like she's infected Kate with it too.\n\nBe careful with this relationship. Strict gender roles are not easy to live with, and you might only find out the worst once you have kids.\n\nNTA with bells on.", "After reading so many posts on this site by and about men horrified at the sight of feminine hygiene products, this post is so refreshing! There is nothing shameful about pads or tampons. Your girlfriend's mom has very outdated ideas about natural bodily functions. She should get over it. You deserve only thanks for bringing your girlfriend what she needed for her period. You don't owe anyone an apology. Even if you do apologize, it seems like this woman is going to stay mad. NTA.", "NTA. Getting them at all should have been appreciated and their whole argument is sexist and pointless to begin with. Most women are beyond thrilled if their man will even buy them let alone carry them without acting like they\u2019re carrying a bomb.", "NTA\n\nUnless you were walking around them tucked behind your ear like a pencil.\n\nYour GF is right though, you don't need to be rude to her mom just because her mom is rude.  It creates unnecessary problems for your GF.  In the future, let your GF deal with her mom, kill her with kindness.
