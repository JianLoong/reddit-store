The time is now 230pm. My daughter (8f) asked my mom (50f) if she was going to be able to do that, my mom looked her in the eyes and promised they would. So we rode with her to get it done, the setup takes over an hour and they finally get started I took a look at the piece on the leg and from looking I knew she was going to be there all day/night. So I took my kids home to play games, watch a movie and enjoy the rest of the day. Around 10pm my kids are tired and headed to bed except my daughter is now crying her eyes out asking why grandma lied to her, doesn\u2019t like her. My wife and I calmed her down talked to her and she eventually got to sleep. My mom then knocks on my door at 11:30pm all smiles of her new tattoo, I told her I wasn\u2019t happy, my daughter just spent the last hour crying, wondering why her grandmother lied to her, my mom acts like it\u2019s not a big deal and says \u201cI came back I promised I would\u201d at 11:30pm at night the kids are asleep and all the stores are closed. She now wants to come back tomorrow and I told her if my children don\u2019t want to go with her or talk to her anymore she\u2019s not welcome around us anymore.
