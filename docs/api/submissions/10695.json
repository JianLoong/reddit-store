Even though the room they would be moving into is bigger than the one at their place.  \n\n\nI have a bit of perspective from both sides, as we lived in a pretty big house but had more people living in it than we had space. It was a split foyer house; two bedrooms, a bathroom, living room, kitchen, and dining room upstairs; two bedrooms, a bathroom, a 'family room' and a laundry/storage room that remained unfinished for tax reasons.  \n\n\nMy parents had the biggest room when we first moved in, and I was in the smallest and shared with my older sister, because at the time I was three months old and she was three years old. We all stayed upstairs because it was safer and easier for my parents. I should also mention that the biggest bedroom in the basement was for my half-sister, who was splitting her time between our house and her mom's house. Three years later, my brother is born and the game of bedroom ring around the Rosie starts.  \n\n\nMy parents moved into the bedroom downstairs, my half sister graduated from highschool and moved in with a friend for college, my older sister and I got bunk beds and slept in my parents old room together, and my brother was put in the smallest room by himself. Not that he slept in there much anyways. Two years later, my youngest sister is born.  \n\n\nBaby is put in the small nursery room, my sister and I take my half sister's old room and share it, after painting half the room hot pink and the other half bubblegum pink. My brother got our old room to himself because he has autism, and when he was little he needed his own space to cool down.  \n\nA few years later, I decide that I'm old enough to have my own room, and also my sister just doesn't want to share everything with me anymore lmao. So little sister is moved in with my brother because they ended up becoming besties, and I moved into the tiniest room in the house.  \n\n\nHere is where I can understand where your step daughters are coming from. Teenagers need a lot of space, and I wasn't even a teenager yet when I decided I didn't want to share a room with my sister anymore. I love her to death, she is my best friend in the whole wide world, but she also annoys the shit out of me sometimes. My sister also wanted privacy because she WAS a teenager, and she was going through very intimate changes that she didn't want her little sister to see. She wanted a space to have friends her age come over and hang out in, she eventually started dating and didn't want her little sister third wheeling when they played video games. I get it. I get why your fiance is desperate to give the girls more space. Because they are probably nagging the shit out of her to fix the space issue when she doesn't have that option. It would piss me off too.  \n\n\nI'll skip the rest of the bedroom roulette we had in that house, because it ultimately doesn't matter. My older sister has moved out and been living on her own for a while now, and we have moved to a new house. My younger brother and sister both have their own rooms upstairs, and my parents get the master bedroom upstairs as well. I am now in your daughter's position, where I basically have the whole basement to myself. And this basement is gigantic.  \n\nI have my own room and office, which are connected by a jack-and-jill bathroom that only I use. I have my own laundry closet with my own washing machine and dryer that came with the house. There is also a laundry closet upstairs, and you couldn't pry my mom's machines from her cold dead hands. The space I have is insane, all I really need is a kitchenette, and I basically have my own house down here.  \n\n\nI would sooner move out than share a bathroom with my brother again. Deadass, if I had to share a bathroom with my brother again, I would move in with my sister. So I get where your daughter is coming from.  \n\n\nAs for advice, I guess I don't have any. Moving out into a bigger home is logically the best solution, but no one is going to be happy to do that. I can also tell you from experience, moving out of your childhood home during school sucks some major donkey balls.  \n\n\nMy best advice would be to just not move in together. You guys can still be a couple while apart. In social psychology, it's called Living-Apart-Together. Many couples do this for many reasons, and the situation you described is exactly why some people chose LAT. If you're worried about how not living together would affect your relationship, get some marriage counseling. I mean, I think everyone should do marriage counseling before getting married, since I know that couples who do counseling are statistically more likely to stay together and report having more fulfilling and happy relationships. But still. Look into the LAT relationship style, and talk to a counselor. You don't have to end your relationship just because you can't live together. And just because you can't live together now doesn't mean you never will! Your kids will eventually get their own places, and then you guys can be together all you want! It's certainly not ideal, but if all other options are no good then waiting might just be the best solution.  \n\n\nAs a joke suggestion, why don't you have your fiance move in and the step daughter's can keep the old house to themselves? One of them can move into mom's old room, and now they don't have to share literally anything and they get a whole house of space! They can come over and visit whenever, you guys can go over and visit whenever, you can still financially support them, etc. It's technically unfair to your daughter since she only gets a basement and they get an entire house, but...", "YTA.  Do you really expect fiancee to move in with you under these circumstances?  Your daughter can either share the basement with the other 14 year old, or take the upstairs room by herself with the other two sharing.  Or just don't move in right now. Or get a bigger place. Or you could even give up the master for the office so that the girls  have a bigger room.

Because it's not fair to move the daughter out of the room she decorated with her mum, I get that, but the 2 girls are moving from the home they lived in with their Dad... which isn't fair on them either, and they're all making all of the sacrifice anyway.\n\nExtension or wait until all children are out of the house and, in your daughter's case, more emotionally distanced from the the room,  to cohabit together.

They decorated her room together. \n\nBut I need to know the circumstances regarding his fianc\u00e9es kids. Did their dad die or did their parents just divorce (not making light of divorce, just trying to get the bigger picture)? I think that the answer to this question will determine exactly how empathetic op needs to be. I know that sounds awful, but I couldn\u2019t think of a better word. I just mean that, if the step kid\u2019s dad died, then he should be a little more understanding of his future wife\u2019s defensiveness and her desire to protect and advocate for her children. If their father is still alive but their parents are divorced, I would understand wanting to protect op\u2019s daughters memories a little more. Does that make sense? I don\u2019t know how to word it. \n\nEither way, I think communication *with the children* is key here. I mean, obviously op\u2019s daughter is his priority, just like his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s daughters are her priority. And I think that openly communicating what the circumstances are with them would help a lot in the long run. Even if you\u2019re not their dad, they will at least be appreciative of the fact that you respect them enough to listen to and consider their input. And your daughter will feel heard in her frustrations and fears. I mean, you don\u2019t want to shove your future step kids into a space with no room, but you also don\u2019t want your daughter to be concerned about her mother and their bond being erased. \n\nEither way, blending a family is hard, especially when the children are all close to *legal* adulthood. They didn\u2019t grow up together. It will be harder to foster a relationship between them and you definitely can\u2019t force it. All you can do is introduce the proper tools, provide a healthy example, and let them nurture it if they choose to do so. \n\nOp, does your daughters stuff take up the entirety of the basement, barring the bathroom? If not, is it possible to convert the space into two rooms? If it does take up the entirety of the basement, is it possible to condense her space without disrupting and ruining her and her mother\u2019s work?\n\nI\u2019ve noticed that you seem to be pretty angry in your replies. I definitely understand your frustration and stress regarding this situation. Finding a solution that works for everyone is not going to be a cakewalk. But you need to understand that going into this marriage and situation angry is not helpful. It won\u2019t help you, your soon-to-be wife, or her kids. And while your child is your priority (which she should be), you need to understand that your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s children are her top priority. And at the rate you are currently at, you are running the risk of alienating not only your step children, but you future wife as well. \n\nI really think you need to go into this with an open mind. I am not advocating for you to push your child and her needs to the back burner, but I think you need to get the perspective of the whole thing. Your fianc\u00e9es children matter too, which is why I think they should be included in the discussion. You don\u2019t have to do everyone together the first time. Maybe ask your fianc\u00e9e if you can speak to her children and discuss what they want. Let them know what your ideas are and see if they\u2019re receptive. If they\u2019re not, go back to the drawing board. Speak to your daughter (maybe with the fianc\u00e9e present) and ask her what her thoughts and feelings are. Don\u2019t let your fianc\u00e9e try and guilt her into anything, but do let your fianc\u00e9e make her thoughts known. \n\nBest of luck to you op. This is an incredibly sticky and difficult situation but I do hope that you are able to find a compromise that works for everyone, your daughter included. \n\nI will say NAH, only because no one as been an ah yet.
