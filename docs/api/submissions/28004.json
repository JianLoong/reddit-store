I said yes and we excitedly started discussing wedding visions. It\u2019s important to mention my twin messaged me a seemingly random date for Aug 2024 while I was on vacation. When I questioned it she simply said \u201cmy wedding\u201d This exchange of messages took place before my fianc\u00e9 proposed to me. \n\nAfter our trip, we attended a dinner at my parents house with family, my twin, and her fianc\u00e9 in attendance. She got engaged Sept 2022. Over dinner everyone was curious on when we were planning on getting married so we honestly answered \u201cmaybe July 2024\u201d I will also say before our response together, I jokingly said \u201cAug 1 2024\u201d and everyone laughed including her fianc\u00e9. I did explain it was a joke afterwards just to make sure everyone knew I wasn\u2019t serious.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 actually picked the time of year himself. When he explained all his reasonings I agreed we could look for dates in July. Later that week I had a call with my twin and she brought up the joke date asking if I was serious. I explained no it was a joke. She asked if we were serious about July to which I told her yes. She told me my fianc\u00e9 and I were being disrespectful and she expected an apology from him for choosing that time of year because we knew she already had a set date in Aug. I explained we did not pick that time of year with any intentions of hurting her feelings or being malicious or evil. She did not care. The phone call ended after she explained she could not put into words correctly how she felt and she would contact me later.\n\nShe never reached out so I waited until the next day to call and talk to her. I asked if she\u2019d had time to figure out the right words so I could understand how she felt. She told me she didn\u2019t need to explain anything because she\u2019d already told me she felt disrespected. The call then devolved to her basically screaming and yelling at me. She requested that I not talk to her about wedding related things until I have a set date and venue with a deposit put down.\n\nThe basic message I got from her is she does not want me to get married before her even if it\u2019s only by a month. Other than that it is very hard to get her to clearly communicate exactly how she feels or what she means by what she has said. \n\nThere are other conversations that took place between the dinner and the last phone call with her but I feel I have included the most important information.\n\nOne of my fianc\u00e9\u2019s reasons for that time of year are specific to a family member\u2019s health. I did not tell my sister this as I did not feel it was my place. Since then my fianc\u00e9 has had a discussion with her fianc\u00e9 and disclosed that information.

It feels very much intentional, even if you say it is not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni am not calling you an asshole but I see where she is coming from, from the outside it really looks like you have rushed to be the first one married As soon as she had a date.", "INFO: where will these weddings be taking place? Will family members need to travel to them?\n\nIf your sister genuinely doesn\u2019t want you getting married at any time before her, AND if you\u2019re both going to get married in a place where nobody important needs to travel to the wedding, I\u2019d say N T A.\n\nBut if she\u2019s just upset because you\u2019re creating a situation where people will have to choose which wedding to attend because they\u2019re less than a month apart, then YTA. She picked her date and told it to you before you even got engaged.", "Two weddings within 30 days is a big ol burden for family and will be hard for everyone to attend both. I get that your twin is upset. It is kind of a poor manners move to scheduling your wedding 30 days before her already schedule wedding. I get the extenuating circumstances but it's just not polite or respectful.\n\nYTA but not a super big one", "Yta.  She tells you when her wedding is and you come back from vacation and \"joke\" your getting married august too only to say \"no not really that wouldn't be cool actually were getting married a few days before that\". So how was saying august a joke that's essentially the same. You do seem to have gone out of the way to have your wedding before your twins and so close to it.\n\nWeddings take prep and planning. dresses can take 12-18 months , venues are booked out at least a year in advance, and so are caterers and good djs/bands and photographers. If your fiance wants july, then july 2025 makes sense. Otherwise you are trying to plan a wedding in the next 9 months. Which yes can be done depending on the type of wedding, but I've a feeling you don't want to just turn up at the courthouse.\n\nAnd if its july for the health of a family member, why wouldn't you have said \"well you know how sick is, doctor gave them 10 months, and fiance really wants them there. So we'll be getting married in July so they can be there. I know that's close to yours but we're planning a much smaller ceremony and celebration. I think it should work out OK.\" And there isn't a weeding that you can plan in 9 months that you can't plan in 6 or 7 months.\n\nBy planning a wedding 1 month before your twins wedding, you're expecting your shared family and friends to travel and pay for the expenses to go to both weddings and any wedding activities so close together.\n\nAlso, in the run-up to the wedding, she'll be busy planning her own wedding, maybe having a hen do. And she'll be doing lots of organising and last-minute prep. And hoping for help and support from her family. Having yours the month before uses up everyone's spare time, and desire for prty planning, not to mention needing to recuperate and rest.\n\nSo you have your wedding in July and then go on your honeymoon to come back for your sisters wedding which will most likely be the first time seeing everyone from your wedding who will ask questions like, how was the honeymoon. Did you enjoy your big day? So now your twins' wedding is about you too.\n\nYes no one gets to declare a wedding month or whatever, but you do want to be considerate to other people, which your decision isn't. Honestly, it does seem deliberate.", "Using a family members health as the reason seems silly when you're waiting *7 months* any way. Are they ill? Like, how is 7 months a hurry? I know weddings can take time but those are usually blow out weddings. If this family member is really important to your husband why wait so long, am I missing something?\n\nReally not sure if you're the AH but seems weird to put it so close to her date. And honestly it would be nice for your family members to be able spread out the dates and costs of it all. Even June would be better, May best.\n\nedit: **9** month wait! not 7. Even worse.", "Honestly ESH. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much that you\u2019re getting married before her, it\u2019s that it\u2019s so close together. There are going to be people who can\u2019t make it to both and may chose to come to only one of the two, and there are inevitably going to be comparisons between the weddings and she may feel as if she\u2019ll have to compete with yours since yours is first. \n\nShe was likely looking forward to being the centre of attention for a while (and let\u2019s face it, most brides want just a little bit of time of it being all about them) but now you\u2019re both going to have to share the limelight\u2026there will be two rounds of dress shopping, two rounds of bachelorette parties, people asking both of you about your wedding plans.\n\nIt might not be malicious but I can see how she feels you\u2019re trying to steal her thunder.", "Yta\n\nPersonally, I would feel weird about having a wedding so close to my sibling. And if they had announced first, I would definitely think most people would think I had ulterior motives. There's 12 months in the year, and you had to choose the month right before?\n\nIf there are health issues involved, why not have it even sooner? Or are the health issues going to get better? Then have the wedding a few months later.\n\nSome people really love the whole wedding thing. Why steal their thunder?\n\nI wouldn't want to be the one who can't let my sister have her own season.", "YTA. you knew she was getting married in august.", "NAH\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound malicious and there is a health reason\u2026\n\nBUT 2 back to back weddings is really hard for a lot of people to accommodate, especially if travel is involved. Since yours is first, there may be people that only come to your wedding. Additionally, your poor parents will probably be maxed out!\n\nIf you can, I would move it forward more, maybe  May or April, so there are at least a few months difference.\n\nEdit: changes from N T A to N A H because I don\u2019t think the sister is a AH for feeling the way she does", "If it's so urgent to get married for a relative's health and the standard venues are booked, have a smaller wedding on a weekday (less popular) in March, and a blowout 1 year anniversary celebration the following year. Then the relative goes to the earlier wedding, and your celebration/party doesn't upstage your sister. And you get married earlier, which is supposedly your objective.\n\nNo? That doesn't work? Why not? Because you don't want to upstage your sister? Right.\n\nYTA.", "YTA", "I\u2019m sorry but YTA. My brother got engaged 5 months before me. I set a 6 month MINIMUM from the day of his wedding. People deserve their own time in the sun", "2024 is a leap year so there will be 366 days, and you just had to pick a date just before your sister's already set wedding?\n\nYTA.", "YTA. I am a sister and I do NOT need your sister to explain to me why she is upset. Why do you?\n\nShe is not saying you can\u2019t get married before her. She is saying that picking a date a month before hers makes you an a-hole and she is right.\n\nAsk yourself this question: If September were the month your partner preferred, would you be happy w following her wedding?

Nobody owns the day year time or whatever people need to get over themselves when they want to be the center of attention nobody really cares honestly, they go there to celebrate today not to sit there and gloat over the bride", "YTA. you knew it would be bad enough to say 1 august as a \u2018joke\u2019 so don\u2019t act ignorant", "YTA. \n\nShe told you the date. You then scheduled your wedding *a month before* hers after she had a two-year engagement. That\u2019s a major asshole move.\n\nMany family won\u2019t be able to attend both weddings. There is the matter of wedding present competition. And who\u2019s paying for these weddings? Is your father on the hook for them, as is traditional? Or are you paying for them yourselves? If you\u2019re paying for them yourselves, who has more resources and will therefore have the bigger, fancier wedding?\n\nYour sister is perfectly right to be angry. You should delay your wedding to at least six months after your sister\u2019s wedding. You should also apologize to your sister and *hope* you can repair the relationship.", "YTA. Your fiance is also an AH. As soon as you got home you were joking about getting married on August 1, then July. That was before you even searched for venues. \n\nYour sister can see through your lies. You're being malicious and I hope it bites you and your man in the ass.\n\nEdit to add and typo: \n\nYour fiance gave you his reasons for July and you agreed that he can look for dates then. You didn't try for earlier then couldn't find openings, blah blah. You're embellishing the truth. Talking in circles to justify your horrible behavior.", "Yta.\nBut more importantly than a bunch of internet strangers' opinions, I promise you that the people in your life (family/friends) think you've done this maliciously and that you're being petty.\n\nIs that how you want the people you care about to view you as? Some pathetic attention seeker?", "nta. your sister's wedding is 3 years after the engagement while yours is 11 months after. it's her fault for dragging this out, she needs to grow up", "I\u2019m going to give you a soft YTA partly for your behavior towards your sister and partly to yourself. \n\nI\u2019m getting married in two weeks. We started planning on October 1, 2022. We selected our venue first and chose our date with the venue. I would like to add that until you have secured a venue, you do not actually have a date. If you have a dream venue you have to go with what\u2019s available. If you\u2019re doing it in someone\u2019s backyard, then you do have a date. Additionally, at least in the US (I don\u2019t know where you live), planning a wedding in under a year is a chore. Honestly doing it in just over a year is still a chore. We started calling photographers the day after we chose our venue. We spoke with 15 different people before we found one that wasn\u2019t already booked. Hair and makeup I booked within the next month. I called the dress shop I was planning on using, gave them our date and they said you have to be in by the end of October of 2022 or we may not be able to get everything done in time. I\u2019m telling you all of this as a way to let you know the timelines on The Knot or other websites for when you need to do things are not accurate any longer. \n\nLastly weddings are so expensive. And if you are going to be involved in each other\u2019s weddings you are literally just adding extra financial pressure to yourself and your sister, without allowing time to earn and save more money. If you have two bachelorette trips, $$$$. I know I\u2019m making assumptions here, and bachelorette parties are all hypothetical. There\u2019s also bridal showers that would have to be coordinated. Someone in our wedding party basically did the same to us as you are doing to your sister and while I never said anything because they are genuinely lovely people and I just don\u2019t think they thought about it, it rubbed me the wrong way for a long time. This year has been even more expensive due to attending their out of state wedding recently, as well as my fianc\u00e9 going on a multi day bachelor party that required flights. \n\nAs to the illness on your fianc\u00e9s side of the family, I understand that as well. My dad just passed away. It sounds like this person has a severe if not terminal illness, and if so, there\u2019s no planning for when they\u2019ll go. My dad was sick for a really long time. I knew it was coming, fully expected it this year. But he had still been doing ok so when I got the call I was stunned. \n\nI think if nothing else you need to do more research to see if your date is even possible from a venue/photographer/dress perspective. Also think about how even if you aren\u2019t trying to be first, and not trying to take anything away from your sister, that the decisions you are making are in some ways going to have a negative impact on your sister. It sounds like you love her, if that\u2019s true, then take time to process that.", "YTA ya you did choose this date knowing hers. This was really shitty and a lot of people will definitely see it this way too. I say have your wedding the year after or 3 months later because right now it looks like you want to upstage her", "NAH - She's probably feeling sensitive because now she'll have to spend a lot of time supporting you with your wedding during a time when she really needs to be focused on preparing for her own wedding.  \n\nI think it's less likely that she's upset you're getting married before her and more upset that you're getting married so near to her own wedding.  It's especially complicated by the fact that the two of you may have an overlap in members of your wedding parties. \n\nYour sister just wants everything to be right.  She's got this huge event to plan and now something has changed and she has to figure out how to manage this new information.  It's stressful.  The way she handled this was hurtful.  She should not have screamed, but I hope the two of you can work this out.  Communication is so important. \n\nMaybe you can talk with her about what feelings she's having.  See why this feels unacceptable to her.  Then  you can work on an option that will work for both of you.", "YTA", "YTA - anyone with good manners, decent etiquette or love for their sibling wouldn\u2019t want to steal their thunder like this!  Stop blaming your fianc\u00e9e for picking July - it\u2019s your wedding! Also it\u2019s unfair to ask family and friends to attend two weddings so close - to spend on presents, accommodation and outfits!

Yuk!", "NTA\n\nI see a lot of people saying you are jealous and trying to sneak your wedding in but it could just as easily be the other way around. Your twin text you her wedding date right when you went on this trip? That\u2019s suspicious. She either knew you were getting engaged or suspected it. Then quickly sent over the date to force your hand. She had over a year to plan and waited until that moment? She\u2019s upset bc she thought by telling you her date you would have no choice but to book after. That way of thinking is ridiculous to me. \n\nJust get married when you want to and be happy for your twin and her wedding. There doesn\u2019t need to be a competition. If you have a room full of people at your wedding gossiping about how you are married first and your twin is so shameful for having it a month after, you have the wrong type of people in your circle. If you or your twin think that will happen by choosing a July wedding and an August wedding there is a lot more going on here than two couples wanting to be married.", "She gave you a date for her wedding, so you\u2019ve come back with one a month before and you seriously don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that? \n\nYes YTA, it was underhand and mean", "YTA and a major one", "Yta, just book it for the year after it wouldnt kill you.", "INFO - I think it being for health reasons would definitely change the vast majority of people\u2019s perspectives.\n\nI would be interested to know what\u2019s happened since she found that out. \n\nIf she\u2019s still angry then that would be AH territory.\n\nBut without that very important piece of information, it does seem a little odd that you\u2019d choose a date so close to hers.", "NAH. I think both of you just really need to calm down and communicate with each other.", "I\u2019m an identical twin, we both got engaged around the same time.

I don\u2019t think at anytime she was mad my wedding was so close to hers.  \n\nI think your sister doesn\u2019t like the fact that all the attention is not on her. Now both of you are sharing a huge life event within weeks of each other and that attention has now been split between the 2 of you.

I don\u2019t know what your experiences are of being a twin so am saying this with caution. We were always compared growing up, both implicitly and explicitly. We also love each other. However, growing up with these comparisons is hard, really hard.

Whatever feelings you would have in those situations, your sister has now. Except that she had August in the bag already, so its a touch worse for her. \n\nIf you guys had only a few people it common, this would all be stupid to argue about.

And given that etiquette dictates that gifts are not brought to the wedding and may be appropriately delivered up to a year after the date, I think you should keep your mouth quiet regarding that whole topic.  \n\nI am wondering if your partner is game for a May or June wedding.  I think that doing it as much earlier as possible would help to reduce the sense of competition.   (And are we all going back to Iceland for your honeymoon? I will gladly use that as an excuse to go back.)", "My sister is 2 years older than me.

She knew & wanted to put up a stink about it. Then soft Y-T-A because you did already know her date, and 2 weddings plus all their events in the same season for all the same family is going to be very hard for your family. Move yours up sooner if you\u2019re truly concerned about a family member\u2019s health.

If you have a loved one that you know is dying, that's a \"screw the details, we're having a civil ceremony with you and a few close loved ones ASAP\", and THEN you set a plan that takes the normal amount of time and if the loved one is there hurray they get to attend as well, if not then hurray, they were there for the important bit - seeing someone they love form a union with the person they love.  Somehow you and your fiance both believe that letting your sister's wedding pass before you have yours is just too much to ask for their poor, dying relative... but also the 9 months before that, if poor, dying relative kicks the bucket, oh well, tough luck, what more could you possibly have done? \n\n\"*I didn't want immediate NTA answers!\"*\n\nI'm sorry, what the hell does that even mean?

Honestly, this kind of takes precedence for me. I wish so, so badly my aunt could have been at my wedding\u2026 but COVID got in the way, and then killed her. I will never be over that. \n\nGoing forward I would get together with her, validate her feelings, and explain your side with your fianc\u00e9s help. \n\nBut also I lack understanding of sensitive family members. I got married on my only Nephews 1st birthday\u2026 my brother and SIL did not care at all. Just made a joke about us never forgetting our anniversary as he\u2019ll be a great reminder! I\u2019d personally have been stoked I could do all the wedding stuff with my twin", "I was going to say YTA as it felt kind of petty to plan your wedding one month before hers when she already had her date set. HOWEVER, the info about your fianc\u00e9's family member having terminal cancer definitely makes you NTA. And while I appreciate you wanting to leave it to your fianc\u00e9 to share that info, this is your twin sister. Without that info, she can't understand why you're choosing this date, and I'm sure to her it feels like you're trying to upstage her. But anyone with half a heart would understand your reasoning if they had all the info. Talk to your sister, tell her what's going on, and I'm sure she will understand.", "Your wedding has nothing to do with hers and hers has nothing to do with you. You start your life with your spouse whenever you want to. My cousin got engaged 3 years before me, but I had my wedding 6 weeks before hers. She wasn\u2019t happy at first but I didn\u2019t care. It wasn\u2019t a race. And I\u2019m not putting my life on hold because it took her forever to plan/pay for a wedding. We were more ready than she was because she wanted a $30k wedding and we wanted a $10k wedding. She also waited that long because her parents HATED her fianc\u00e9 and were holding out as long as they could in hopes of them breaking up before they had to shell the money out. But I didn\u2019t have those issues either. My whole family loves my husband. Your timeline doesn\u2019t have to coordinate or match up or \u201crespect\u201d anyone else\u2019s timeline. I\u2019d say a month before is NOT shitty in ANY WAY. If you tried to do the same weekend, that\u2019d be mean. But a month apart is plenty of time for family to plan/figure it out. Do NOT change the course/timing of YOUR life to appease someone who\u2019s just trying to compete with you.

It will be just as hard for extended family then too if they\u2019re both within a few months at all. Weddings are expensive and you do what you can when you can.

This is better for traveling family, there's a higher chance the terminal family member can attend without having too many complications, you won't have 2 weddings so close together, your sister still gets the attention and time she want and deserves, you get to come down from your honeymoon phase a bit so you can give your sister your full attention on and around her wedding. A lot of plusses to consider here.", "NTA she texted you knowing you were about to get engaged. She couldn\u2019t have found a date sooner and let you know before knowing you were getting engaged?? Then she\u2019s upset about it after being engaged 2 years? \n\nDon\u2019t think it should really matter since it sounds like not a lot of your family will have to deal with travel. She could have picked a sooner date but why did she tell you while you were on holiday when she knew you were getting engaged? Thats just weird to me. \n\nOP for the family health piece see if you can go sooner. A family friend did a small family only wedding ceremony and then 3 months later did the full wedding celebration. They\u2019re actual anniversary is still the first date. Maybe do a small one in March and then give yourself until October for the big shabang?", "NTA.

It really gives me those vibes.", "I would say NTA for needing to marry earlier than expected due to sickness in fianc\u00e9\u2019s family. Your fianc\u00e9e should reach out to her and explain why he wants this date, and see if they can come up with a compromise, as they seem to be the two who care about the date, and it might seem less like competition to your sister if he\u2019s the one negotiating", "NTA.", "Soft YTA but really more info is needed.\n\nIs all of your families close by so travel isn't a consideration?\n\nDoes school vacations matter for your family members?\n\nOne month apart is really close and sort of disrespectful.

This gave people time between the events, meant we didn't have to overlap on showers, and didn't overtax anyone that was mutual in our wedding parties or in getting everything ready. If she is marrying in August why can't your wedding be in at least June to space it out?\n\nI don't think it's okay for her tell you yours needs to be AFTER hers if you also are specifically looking for a summer wedding, or need it to be sooner rather than later because of someone with an illness and time constraints. But putting yours in a time that might not be even a month apart is not cool b/c your parents attention will be split in the weeks leading up to her big event and it's very avoidable.\n\nPlease rethink what you are doing and sit down and have a rational conversation. Be clear about why you want a wedding in the summer of 24 and figure out how you can space it apart to be respectful of both of your needs.", "She is entitled to her feelings, she is not entitled to be mean just because of those feelings, she doesn\u2019t have to marry first, you don\u2019t owe her that, they chose for whatever reason to have a looooooooooong engagement, you chose, for family/personal reasons to have your wedding soon.\n\n\nNTA, good luck.", "NTA.

She doesn't have a terminal family member to stress about.\n\nYour sister is allowed to be upset, but you're still allowed to have your wedding when you want.

Based on the comments, OP has actually covered most of the bases of complaint for why you wouldn\u2019t want a relatives wedding close to your own. She\u2019s spoken to any family members who have to travel and they all plan to attend both, and she\u2019s encouraged them if they had to pick for whatever reason, to pick her sister\u2019s. So it\u2019s not about guests bailing on sister\u2019s wedding.

But I also endorsed and encouraged a pregnancy announcement from a family member at my wedding and had friends get married within two weeks of my wedding, and didn\u2019t care, maybe I\u2019m not the norm with that. That\u2019s the sort of thing that\u2019s only a big deal if you make it one.\n\nOn the other hand, OP has done an extraordinarily poor job communicating everything in this situation, both to her sister, and even how she prioritized info in this post.

If I ever wanted to announce a date for something like this, I would certainly be making a special effort to avoid timing it in such a way that it did harm to the time, money, and effort OP's then-boyfriend had invested in setting up this proposal.

I suspect their parents compared them a lot bc they went out of their ways to be as different as possible\u2026and when it wasn\u2019t possible, it became a huge competition to see who was better. Very sad. My twin and I are very different people and disagree on some things, but I\u2019m glad we weren\u2019t compared a ton when young.

In Feb. 2018, her boyfriend proposed. In April, she told the bridesmaid friends they'd found openings in their chosen venue in August 2018...one bridesmaid friend told me separately and said that the bridesmaids were trying to plan a getaway bachelorette weekend for me the weekend before our wedding but didn't want to miss the other wedding, which meant I had to text the engaged friend and practically beg her to disclose her date so that my bridesmaids could continue planning without conflicting. It was honestly so tough going to her wedding 2 weeks before mine knowing that my engagement was longer than her entire relationship...simply because I'm an anxious girlie and have trouble planning large things in a short timeframe.  \n\n\nEvery year for several years after, the group text would light up about our respective anniversaries that are 2 weeks away from each other. Hindsight 20/20, if everything for my wedding hadn't been booked and paid for long before she chose a date, I'd have \\*postponed\\* my wedding for a few months just to have it be further away from hers.  \n\n\nOP, this is a complicated situation, but YTA for making that joke and not approaching this sensitively considering the overlapping wedding attendees, the length of your twin's engagement, and logistical strains this might put on the family. If you can, have an empathetic discussion where you all 4 sit down and discuss the unique reasons why you and your fiance must get married sooner rather than later. Honestly - and idk how your twin would feel about this - but I'd even suggest moving the date up more if you can swing it.

If they have any family or mutual friends who live far enough away that they\u2019ll have to fly in, weddings in July and August pretty much guarantee they\u2019ll have to choose one wedding to attend. They should either lean into it and plan weddings close enough in time that people could make one trip, and bridal shower/bachelorette could be joint (but it doesn\u2019t sound like OP\u2019s sister wants that at all), or allow a reasonable amount of time between weddings.\n\nI planned a wedding in 5 months, so I know it can be done. Get married before peak season, or choose a non-Saturday date, and they can even get a big discount compared to their July plans.", "A rush isn\u2019t in 9 months though, if the family member is that ill surely it would be sooner?", "if it was due to an ill family member though, it would be much better then, to have the wedding as a winter/late winter one, right?  The family member wouldn't be as far along.  Generally...and I do mean generally...if a person is terminal and that is the reason for trying to pick a date-its picked for a very soon date.  Not several months out.  Why couldn't she have chosen one just AFTER the wedding?   July-August is very close.  If the date and who was first didnt matter to OP, and the individual had that long of a prognosis...is there any reason she couldn't have had the wedding right AFTER her sisters?    \n\n\nEither way she didnt even talk to her sister. She publically gave a date w/o even trying to discuss it.  And this is after she had teased her sister about having a wedding date right before hers-and they clearly didnt have a good relationship from the sounds of it.", "that sounds entirely lovely! \n\nI'd totally be down to have the sunday wedding after my twin's wedding on saturday - drinking all night and dance till my feet kill me isn't my thing anyway, so I'd have no trouble going to bed hahaha.", "Yeah, sister has clearly rushed since finding out OP was going to be proposed to, and is now expecting to be able dictate the timing of both weddings because she was engaged first. \n\nIt\u2019s way more important that OP and her fianc\u00e9 do what\u2019s right for them, including getting married while the fianc\u00e9\u2019s family member can attend. The timing of her sister\u2019s wedding should be a lower priority, and based on her behaviour she doesn\u2019t deserve to be catered to.", "Because in one of the replies, OP says her sister has been looking at venues for months.", "> they have a specific reason to want to do it as soon as possible, because they want a family member with a terminal illness to be there.\n\nRight, nothing says \u201cthis is urgent and cannot possibly wait\u201d like doing something 10 months from now. I mean, 12 months would be crazy. They couldn\u2019t wait 12 months. 10 months is basically right away.", "If they needed to do it ASAP for a terminal relative?  A wedding can be planned and executed in less than 3 months.  A Christmas wedding would make a lot more sense than delaying it for 9 months just so OP can have it the month before her twin.\n\nThis isn't 9 year olds arguing over something that costs neither of them anything.  It's an adult who decided to schedule a wedding in a way that virtually guarantees no one will go to her sister's wedding.", "When you are sisters and getting married it's best to be married at least 6 months apart so all the family can come if it's 30 days or less a lot of family will need to choose with one to atente", "Exactly. If they wanted to be sure the sick person was there they would do it much sooner not months away.", "I feel like the sick family member thing is a bit weird. If she were getting married next month to accommodate/include the person w/cancer, I\u2019d get it. But her wedding date is almost a year away and she\u2019s claiming now that 1 month will make a big difference?\n\nMassive side eye.", "OP and her fiance have started the planning, and seem to think that they would not be able to have the kind of wedding they want sooner than that.\n\nBesides, the likelihood of the relative being able to attend may depend largely on treatment schedules and cycles, not just whether or not the person has fucking died yet.", "I'm really sorry for what you're going through. I can't even imagine. Wishing nothing but the very best for your family \u2764\ufe0f", "Definitely agree with a lot of this.  \nMy friends are getting married (to each other) fairly soon. Their SIL/sister got engaged a few months before them. She's in Utah. We're in California. A huge amount of her and my friend's family is in Florida and Georgia. \nMy friends are having their wedding here in California.   \nSo, the way things have hashed out is that my friends are getting married Oct 8, and she's getting \"married\" Oct 12th, here in California. Her and her husband to be are getting the license signed at their local courthouse before my friends' ceremony, but they'll be throwing a celebration at a park nearby the new in-laws house.   \nBoth parties are satisfied with this arrangement, as it was communicated well beforehand and with either party welcome to say no. Sister/SIL planned to actually have a December wedding, but knew some of her family members were going to refuse to fly out twice in one year, so it was either have a wedding of five people, or a celebration with thirty.   \nOP choosing a date so close to their sister's without running it by her is definitely an AH move. There's so many different ways to do a wedding. They should definitely find a solution that doesn't mean a wedding a month before their sibling\"s wedding.", "Interesting, down here in the SE, Late-March\u2014June and Mid-Sept\u2014Mid November are prime wedding season.\n\nJuly is too hot.\n\nNow OPs location becomes a factor.\n\nWhere ya at OP?", "July is not peak wedding season.", "The sister doesn\u2019t want OP\u2019s wedding before hers at all. She wants it after, which makes it less likely terminally ill family member would be able to attend.", "They can do a small wedding around his schedules treatments and not wait 10 months and get married 1 month less then 30 days before sister", "I'm so sorry you've been through so much, especially in such a short time. I'm sending you healing vibes and lots of love", ">It seems that Twin knew that OP's fiance was going to propose, and so she messaged a date solely so that she could essentially say \"I messaged you the date before the proposal, and now you cannot get married before that time.\"\n\nOOH, that's a really good point. i missed that. That totally changes the context then. The twin was trying to manipulate the dates to be the first.", "This is a huge guess. There was nothing in the past to support this view", "People don't have infinite resources. Deliberately scheduling your wedding to be a month before a close friend or relatives is a dick move because that means you're effectively poaching guests.", "i said this in another comment, but IMO i don\u2019t think the real reason OP wants to have the wedding in July right before her twin\u2019s is because the family member has terminal cancer.\n\nif that was actually an important reason for having the wedding earlier, then i don\u2019t understand how having the wedding 10 months from now is going to help.\n\ni don\u2019t want to be that guy, but i\u2019m just being logical here. do they realistically think that this family member with terminal cancer will be alive/able to attend the wedding in 10 months?\n\npersonally i\u2019m not buying it, and it sounds like a pretty fucked up reason to cover for spiting OP\u2019s twin.", "i\u2019m pretty skeptical to say the least. yes we don\u2019t have all the details but to pick a date 10 months from now that happens to be a few weeks before OP\u2019s twin\u2019s wedding is pretty suspicious.\n\nwhether this person has been given a year or more to live or not, terminal cancer is no joke, and if this is the real reason for having the wedding before OP\u2019s twin\u2019s, then i would think they would try to plan it a lot sooner.", "Peak wedding season is very location dependent. In the area I currently live in, May to August is considered peak wedding season. And April or September is consider shoulder season.", "Or she was just giving OP a heads up to avoid fate conflicts.* I know she's getting engaged soon and while it's a bit early to send out invites I should let her know what day my weddings going to be on before they start looking at dates* would be a pretty reasonable thought process", "personally i don\u2019t see how this is relevant. OP\u2019s twin had already been engaged and seems to understand that weddings take about a year of planning in advance (given that she told OP good luck with finding a venue, etc.) so that would imply that the twin had already planned the date for her wedding.\n\npersonally this feels pretty spiteful on OP\u2019s behalf to me. OP jokingly tells her twin that she\u2019s going to get married August 1st before the twin\u2019s wedding (which means OP knows that this would irritate her twin), then tells her that she\u2019s actually planning the wedding a few weeks earlier.\n\non top of this, i call BS on the \u2018real reason\u2019 for the July date being that OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9 has a family member with terminal cancer. i don\u2019t mean to be the bearer of bad news, but let\u2019s be realistic: what are the odds that this family with terminal cancer will even be alive/able to attend the wedding 10 months from now?\n\ni know this is a lot of speculation, but based on all of the information i say YTA.", "Maybe. But sister got engaged last Year. Of course assuming she'd b married first.", "It's possible she had the date set in advance but wasn't at the point of sending out invites yet and was giving OP a heads up specifically to avoid date conflicts like this.", "Exactly - unless you are all local and all of your family is in the same town.", "Yeah but like all things in marriage there needs to be compromise. This is all about him and his family at a big expense to hers.", "My dad was like this too, we went on a road trip a couple of weeks before he passed, and I was home to visit when he died specifically because we'd originally been planning on going to the beach that weekend. Having to manage the wheelchair and oxygen all the time was scary, but yeah... he wanted to so we did it. Sorry for your loss!", "Tell me you've never worked in a hospital without telling me... One thing I have absolute confidence in is that when someone has a terminal illness things almost always get progressively worse... the likelihood of this person staying stable for almost a year is slim to none, cancer absolutely sucks the life out of you.", "I agree, OP YTA. I get wanting loved ones to be there but life happens and people won\u2019t be able to come. Someone with terminal cancer may not feel well enough, perfectly healthy people may have a baby (which they wouldn\u2019t even know yet), people will have travel chaos or other plans or accidents or get sick too.", "Then she should have set a date, she had  *plenty* of time.", "Sister got engaged last year, so will have a 2 year engagement. OP doesn\u2019t want a 2 year engagement. It isn\u2019t right for sister to say she can\u2019t get married before her, especially as she\u2019s blocked out basically a year\u2019s time. Nope. OP and fianc\u00e9 can get married at the time of THEIR choosing, not sister\u2018s choosing. If sister wants the first wedding, she better move that date.\n\nHowever, if It\u2019s important enough that this person with terminal cancer attend OP and fianc\u00e9\u2019s wedding, they should probably make it sooner than 8 months away.", "Two years from engagement to wedding is a long fucking time. Unless it's some enormous event she could've set the date sooner and otherwise can't get pissy people will get married in the meantime. You can't claim two and a half years just because people can't get married before or around your wedding.", "At this point I'd want to see a receipt.\n\nOf course the OP's not much better. Saying she has to set the date in 9 months from now for \"terminal cancer\" ... that's oddly specific, quite long if for a terminal diseas, and conveniently right in front of the other date.  \n\n\n(no rush but it has to be in exactly 9 months).  \n\n\nESH", "I\u2019m not a twin, but my older sister (3 years older) and I had a similar relationship. Besides the fact that we look the same, we also have the same mannerisms and even my baby niece thinks I\u2019m her mom. Anyhow, I eloped six MONTHS after she got married and she was pissed. So pissed that for our tenth anniversary this past August, she straight up refused to go to my wedding\u2026we had only invited 20 people, 4 of whom were from my side of the family. My wedding had a total number of 15 people with only 2 from my family. My husband and I wanted to keep it small and intimate, but I really cared about my sister going and she let me down because of some stupid competition. A competition, I might add, that only she cares about."]}
