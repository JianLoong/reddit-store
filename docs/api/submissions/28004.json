I said yes and we excitedly started discussing wedding visions. It\u2019s important to mention my twin messaged me a seemingly random date for Aug 2024 while I was on vacation. When I questioned it she simply said \u201cmy wedding\u201d This exchange of messages took place before my fianc\u00e9 proposed to me. \n\nAfter our trip, we attended a dinner at my parents house with family, my twin, and her fianc\u00e9 in attendance. She got engaged Sept 2022. Over dinner everyone was curious on when we were planning on getting married so we honestly answered \u201cmaybe July 2024\u201d I will also say before our response together, I jokingly said \u201cAug 1 2024\u201d and everyone laughed including her fianc\u00e9. I did explain it was a joke afterwards just to make sure everyone knew I wasn\u2019t serious.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 actually picked the time of year himself. When he explained all his reasonings I agreed we could look for dates in July. Later that week I had a call with my twin and she brought up the joke date asking if I was serious. I explained no it was a joke. She asked if we were serious about July to which I told her yes. She told me my fianc\u00e9 and I were being disrespectful and she expected an apology from him for choosing that time of year because we knew she already had a set date in Aug. I explained we did not pick that time of year with any intentions of hurting her feelings or being malicious or evil. She did not care. The phone call ended after she explained she could not put into words correctly how she felt and she would contact me later.\n\nShe never reached out so I waited until the next day to call and talk to her. I asked if she\u2019d had time to figure out the right words so I could understand how she felt. She told me she didn\u2019t need to explain anything because she\u2019d already told me she felt disrespected. The call then devolved to her basically screaming and yelling at me. She requested that I not talk to her about wedding related things until I have a set date and venue with a deposit put down.\n\nThe basic message I got from her is she does not want me to get married before her even if it\u2019s only by a month. Other than that it is very hard to get her to clearly communicate exactly how she feels or what she means by what she has said. \n\nThere are other conversations that took place between the dinner and the last phone call with her but I feel I have included the most important information.\n\nOne of my fianc\u00e9\u2019s reasons for that time of year are specific to a family member\u2019s health. I did not tell my sister this as I did not feel it was my place. Since then my fianc\u00e9 has had a discussion with her fianc\u00e9 and disclosed that information.", "created_utc": 1696174475, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16x4bc6/aita_for_planning_on_getting_married_before_my/", "score": 124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It feels very much intentional, even if you say it is not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni am not calling you an asshole but I see where she is coming from, from the outside it really looks like you have rushed to be the first one married As soon as she had a date.", "INFO: where will these weddings be taking place? Will family members need to travel to them?\n\nIf your sister genuinely doesn\u2019t want you getting married at any time before her, AND if you\u2019re both going to get married in a place where nobody important needs to travel to the wedding, I\u2019d say N T A.\n\nBut if she\u2019s just upset because you\u2019re creating a situation where people will have to choose which wedding to attend because they\u2019re less than a month apart, then YTA. She picked her date and told it to you before you even got engaged.", "Two weddings within 30 days is a big ol burden for family and will be hard for everyone to attend both. I get that your twin is upset. It is kind of a poor manners move to scheduling your wedding 30 days before her already schedule wedding. I get the extenuating circumstances but it's just not polite or respectful.\n\nYTA but not a super big one", "Yta.  She tells you when her wedding is and you come back from vacation and \"joke\" your getting married august too only to say \"no not really that wouldn't be cool actually were getting married a few days before that\". So how was saying august a joke that's essentially the same. You do seem to have gone out of the way to have your wedding before your twins and so close to it.\n\nWeddings take prep and planning. dresses can take 12-18 months , venues are booked out at least a year in advance, and so are caterers and good djs/bands and photographers. If your fiance wants july, then july 2025 makes sense. Otherwise you are trying to plan a wedding in the next 9 months. Which yes can be done depending on the type of wedding, but I've a feeling you don't want to just turn up at the courthouse.\n\nAnd if its july for the health of a family member, why wouldn't you have said \"well you know how sick is, doctor gave them 10 months, and fiance really wants them there. So we'll be getting married in July so they can be there. I know that's close to yours but we're planning a much smaller ceremony and celebration. I think it should work out OK.\" And there isn't a weeding that you can plan in 9 months that you can't plan in 6 or 7 months.\n\nBy planning a wedding 1 month before your twins wedding, you're expecting your shared family and friends to travel and pay for the expenses to go to both weddings and any wedding activities so close together.\n\nAlso, in the run-up to the wedding, she'll be busy planning her own wedding, maybe having a hen do. And she'll be doing lots of organising and last-minute prep. And hoping for help and support from her family. Having yours the month before uses up everyone's spare time, and desire for prty planning, not to mention needing to recuperate and rest.\n\nSo you have your wedding in July and then go on your honeymoon to come back for your sisters wedding which will most likely be the first time seeing everyone from your wedding who will ask questions like, how was the honeymoon. Did you enjoy your big day? So now your twins' wedding is about you too.\n\nYes no one gets to declare a wedding month or whatever, but you do what to be considerate to other people, which your decision isn't. Honestly, it does seem deliberate.", "Using a family members health as the reason seems silly when you're waiting *7 months* any way. Are they ill? Like, how is 7 months a hurry? I know weddings can take time but those are usually blow out weddings. If this family member is really important to your husband why wait so long, am I missing something? \n\nReally not sure if you're the AH but seems weird to put it so close to her date. And honestly it would be nice for your family members to be able spread out the dates and costs of it all. Even June would be better, May best.", "Honestly ESH. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s so much that you\u2019re getting married before her, it\u2019s that it\u2019s so close together. There are going to be people who can\u2019t make it to both and may chose to come to only one of the two, and there are inevitably going to be comparisons between the weddings and she may feel as if she\u2019ll have to compete with yours since yours is first. \n\nShe was likely looking forward to being the centre of attention for a while (and let\u2019s face it, most brides want just a little bit of time of it being all about them) but now you\u2019re both going to have to share the limelight\u2026there will be two rounds of dress shopping, two rounds of bachelorette parties, people asking both of you about your wedding plans.\n\nIt might not be malicious but I can see how she feels you\u2019re trying to steal her thunder.", "Yta\n\nPersonally, I would feel weird about having a wedding so close to my sibling. And if they had announced first, I would definitely think most people would think I had ulterior motives. There's 12 months in the year, and you had to choose the month right before?\n\nIf there are health issues involved, why not have it even sooner? Or are the health issues going to get better? Then have the wedding a few months later.\n\nSome people really love the whole wedding thing. Why steal their thunder?\n\nI wouldn't want to be the one who can't let my sister have her own season.", "YTA. you knew she was getting married in august.", "NAH\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound malicious and there is a health reason\u2026\n\nBUT 2 back to back weddings is really hard for a lot of people to accommodate, especially if travel is involved. Since yours is first, there may be people that only come to your wedding. Additionally, your poor parents will probably be maxed out!\n\nIf you can, I would move it forward more, maybe  May or April, so there are at least a few months difference.\n\nEdit: changes from N T A to N A H because I don\u2019t think the sister is a AH for feeling the way she does", "If it's so urgent to get married for a relative's health and the standard venues are booked, have a smaller wedding on a weekday (less popular) in March, and a blowout 1 year anniversary celebration the following year. Then the relative goes to the earlier wedding, and your celebration/party doesn't upstage your sister. And you get married earlier, which is supposedly your objective.\n\nNo? That doesn't work? Why not? Because you don't want to upstage your sister? Right.\n\nYTA.", "YTA", "I\u2019m sorry but YTA. My brother got engaged 5 months before me. I set a 6 month MINIMUM from the day of his wedding. People deserve their own time in the sun", "2024 is a leap year so there will be 366 days, and you just had to pick a date just before your sister's already set wedding?\n\nYTA.", "YTA. I am a sister and I do NOT need your sister to explain to me why she is upset. Why do you?\n\nShe is not saying you can\u2019t get married before her. She is saying that picking a date a month before hers makes you an a-hole and she is right.\n\nAsk yourself this question: If September were the month your partner preferred, would you be happy w following her wedding?

You then scheduled your wedding *a month before* hers after she had a two-year engagement. That\u2019s a major asshole move.\n\nMany family won\u2019t be able to attend both weddings. There is the matter of wedding present competition. And who\u2019s paying for these weddings? Is your father on the hook for them, as is traditional? Or are you paying for them yourselves? If you\u2019re paying for them yourselves, who has more resources and will therefore have the bigger, fancier wedding?\n\nYour sister is perfectly right to be angry. You should delay your wedding to at least six months after your sister\u2019s wedding. You should also apologize to your sister and *hope* you can repair the relationship.", "YTA. Your fiance is also an AH. As soon as you got home you were joking about getting married on August 1, then July.

You're being malicious and I hope it bites you and your man in the ass.\n\nEdit to add and typo: \n\nYour fiance gave you his reasons for July and you agreed that he can look for dates then. You didn't try for earlier then couldn't find openings, blah blah. You're embellishing the truth. Talking in circles to justify your horrible behavior.", "Yta.\nBut more importantly than a bunch of internet strangers' opinions, I promise you that the people in your life (family/friends) think you've done this maliciously and that you're being petty.\n\nIs that how you want the people you care about to view you as? Some pathetic attention seeker?", "nta. your sister's wedding is 3 years after the engagement while yours is 11 months after. it's her fault for dragging this out, she needs to grow up", "I\u2019m going to give you a soft YTA partly for your behavior towards your sister and partly to yourself. \n\nI\u2019m getting married in two weeks. We started planning on October 1, 2022. We selected our venue first and chose our date with the venue. I would like to add that until you have secured a venue, you do not actually have a date. If you have a dream venue you have to go with what\u2019s available. If you\u2019re doing it in someone\u2019s backyard, then you do have a date. Additionally, at least in the US (I don\u2019t know where you live), planning a wedding in under a year is a chore. Honestly doing it in just over a year is still a chore. We started calling photographers the day after we chose our venue. We spoke with 15 different people before we found one that wasn\u2019t already booked. Hair and makeup I booked within the next month. I called the dress shop I was planning on using, gave them our date and they said you have to be in by the end of October of 2022 or we may not be able to get everything done in time. I\u2019m telling you all of this as a way to let you know the timelines on The Knot or other websites for when you need to do things are not accurate any longer. \n\nLastly weddings are so expensive. And if you are going to be involved in each other\u2019s weddings you are literally just adding extra financial pressure to yourself and your sister, without allowing time to earn and save more money. If you have two bachelorette trips, $$$$. I know I\u2019m making assumptions here, and bachelorette parties are all hypothetical. There\u2019s also bridal showers that would have to be coordinated. Someone in our wedding party basically did the same to us as you are doing to your sister and while I never said anything because they are genuinely lovely people and I just don\u2019t think they thought about it, it rubbed me the wrong way for a long time. This year has been even more expensive due to attending their out of state wedding recently, as well as my fianc\u00e9 going on a multi day bachelor party that required flights. \n\nAs to the illness on your fianc\u00e9s side of the family, I understand that as well. My dad just passed away. It sounds like this person has a severe if not terminal illness, and if so, there\u2019s no planning for when they\u2019ll go. My dad was sick for a really long time. I knew it was coming, fully expected it this year. But he had still been doing ok so when I got the call I was stunned. \n\nI think if nothing else you need to do more research to see if your date is even possible from a venue/photographer/dress perspective. Also think about how even if you aren\u2019t trying to be first, and not trying to take anything away from your sister, that the decisions you are making are in some ways going to have a negative impact on your sister. It sounds like you love her, if that\u2019s true, then take time to process that.", "YTA ya you did choose this date knowing hers. This was really shitty and a lot of people will definitely see it this way too. I say have your wedding the year after or 3 months later because right now it looks like you want to upstage her", "NAH - She's probably feeling sensitive because now she'll have to spend a lot of time supporting you with your wedding during a time when she really needs to be focused on preparing for her own wedding.  \n\nI think it's less likely that she's upset you're getting married before her and more upset that you're getting married so near to her own wedding.  It's especially complicated by the fact that the two of you may have an overlap in members of your wedding parties. \n\nYour sister just wants everything to be right.  She's got this huge event to plan and now something has changed and she has to figure out how to manage this new information.  It's stressful.  The way she handled this was hurtful.  She should not have screamed, but I hope the two of you can work this out.  Communication is so important. \n\nMaybe you can talk with her about what feelings she's having.  See why this feels unacceptable to her.  Then  you can work on an option that will work for both of you.", "YTA", "YTA - anyone with good manners, decent etiquette or love for their sibling wouldn\u2019t want to steal their thunder like this!  Stop blaming your fianc\u00e9e for picking July - it\u2019s your wedding!

Yuk!", "NTA\n\nI see a lot of people saying you are jealous and trying to sneak your wedding in but it could just as easily be the other way around. Your twin text you her wedding date right when you went on this trip? That\u2019s suspicious. She either knew you were getting engaged or suspected it. Then quickly sent over the date to force your hand. She had over a year to plan and waited until that moment? She\u2019s upset bc she thought by telling you her date you would have no choice but to book after. That way of thinking is ridiculous to me. \n\nJust get married when you want to and be happy for your twin and her wedding. There doesn\u2019t need to be a competition. If you have a room full of people at your wedding gossiping about how you are married first and your twin is so shameful for having it a month after, you have the wrong type of people in your circle. If you or your twin think that will happen by choosing a July wedding and an August wedding there is a lot more going on here than two couples wanting to be married.", "She gave you a date for her wedding, so you\u2019ve come back with one a month before and you seriously don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with that? \n\nYes YTA, it was underhand and mean", "YTA and a major one", "Yta, just book it for the year after it wouldnt kill you.", "INFO - I think it being for health reasons would definitely change the vast majority of people\u2019s perspectives.\n\nI would be interested to know what\u2019s happened since she found that out. \n\nIf she\u2019s still angry then that would be AH territory.\n\nBut without that very important piece of information, it does seem a little odd that you\u2019d choose a date so close to hers.", "NAH.

I don\u2019t know what your experiences are of being a twin so am saying this with caution. We were always compared growing up, both implicitly and explicitly. We also love each other.

This doesn\u2019t make sense", "Ok, but you said it wasn\u2019t a singular person\u2019s decision and then said he was firm on it. So it is a singular person\u2019s decision just not yours.", "Lol if you really wanted to, you can have the wedding after your sisters wedding. You didnt push it to your fiance because it doesnt affect you personally. YTA", "It's clear who's the one that's really jealous between the 2, and it's not op.", "That's a plan. Elope and invite the family members whose health is being considered at this point. And have a first wedding anniversary or belated wedding reception a year from now", "And there are options that don't blow things up for op's fiance too AKA having the wedding when he wants it", "How much distance in time is needed for individuality? I also didn\u2019t say anything about being worried for specific venues. Just that all the ones we\u2019ve looked at so far are unavailable until after June. I think because I\u2019ve been a twin for so long, I don\u2019t see some situations the same way others might see them. I am also very used to my twin sister being more noticed in my family for multiple things, big and small. It has never bothered me and even if it has I keep it to myself because it\u2019s not a big deal to anyone other than myself.", "Thank you. I hope things work out for both couples as well.", "September does not work for the diagnosis of the family member. Thank you for your suggestion though.", "I\u2019m a twin. I wouldn\u2019t do this to my twin it\u2019s really shitty  I get the health concerns but your insecurities of being less noticed etc does not need to be seen by your whole family in this wedding drama. Please move your date to much earlier or later. It gives you and your relationship a really bad look and will definitely affect your sisters views on you"]}
