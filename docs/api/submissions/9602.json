This was never an issue even though the ride is 2 or so hours. \n\nA couple days before my wife went into labor I had a motorcycle accident and broke my collar bone. I was scheduled for an operation on  a monday morning 1st thing. Sunday evening about 2am my wife wakes me up to tell me her water broke. She also tells me \"Don't worry about it i know you have your operation this morning, I'll just take a cab.\" To which I replied \"thats ridiculous, of course I'll take you.   \nI immediatly gather everything together to drive her to NYU. Everything goes relatively smooth other than 30hrs of labor, our baby came out healthy and i was there to see the birth of my newborn. However, I was unable to cancel my appointment because i didn't want to leave my wifes side. After a bit of time i got through to my Dr who said it is imperative that we have the operation before the bone heals while it is splintered... if we don't they will have to re-break it to set it and it may never heal right. They told me they can get me in right away if i head back home to central NJ. I told her what they said and i asked if it was ok with her. to which she replied excitedly \"of course! you should go!\" by the time I had the operation and got back to the hospital another day or so later her entire family was there and the tension in the air was so think you could cut it with a knife. when I finally got to talk to my wife she said she hated that i left her there all alone to which things got heated and the last thing she said to me before i decided to drop it is\"i hate you for leaving me alone like this at a time that i needed you here and i will probably hate you for the rest of my life for it\" I couldn't even make the argument that \"you told me I should go\" This is a 10 year old argument and we NEVER bring it up cause its such a hot button issue, but it has always been in the back of my head wether i was right to go.

Did she not want you to ride it before the accident?", "NTA. She probably wasn't as bothered about it until she realised her family was bothered about it and then they probably exacerbated everything and her perspective shifted. \n\nBut she told you when she went into labour that you should stay home for your operation, and then she told you to go after the birth.

Your wife is being unreasonable and unfair.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't leave to go to the bar with the guys, you literally left to go have important surgery.", "NTA. You needed the surgery. Life happens and you gotta roll with the punches. You were there through the 30 hour labor and to me, that seems sufficient given that family was with her when you came back. I would assume hormones could play a part in reacting that way in the moment, but for the next 10 years after that? That kind of reaction is absurdly disproportionate.\n\nI dont understand why anything mattered other than the baby. To me, the birth of the child is the only focus.\n\nIf your collar bone were to heal improperly it could have impaired your ability to do things with your child for the rest of your life. \n\nDoes she have difficulty being alone in general?\n\nIdk that just seems fcking ludicrous", "It sounds like she was happy for you to go until her family got involved.

You had to take care of a critical medical issue!!! Of course you didn\u2019t plan it anymore than she planned to go into labor that same day. \n\nSorry you\u2019re still suffering on this one. But I hope you can both let it go. 10 years is a long time to hold a grudge.", "NTA - you had a fucking broken collarbone!  How long did she expect you to put off surgery ffs?!  You must have been in pain that whole time.  Let go of feeling bad - you\u2019re allowed to take care of yourself too.", "NAH. The timing was unfortunate, but you had to also fix the bone so you could be strong to look after your child. Your wife gave her blessing for you to go, but also childbirth is rough and it\u2019s valid she regretted it later. However she did have her family there. It\u2019s just a rough situation and emotions are valid on all sides. 10 years later this should be water under the bridge.", "NTA for all the sensible reasons. That being said, how are you mentally coping with staying with someone who's hated you for 10 years and will hate you for the rest of her life? I think if she didn't actually hate you, this argument would have been addressed and resolved 10 years ago.", "I feel like it\u2019s poor decision making to ride a motorcycle when your wife is about to give birth to prevent this exact situation or worse, but based on your question NTA for getting a surgery you needed when you needed it. I do think it was a preventable situation caused by your own choices that was ultimately clearly detrimental to your wife.", "NTA. I know that she just gave birth at the time, but that doesn't make her health more important than yours. Especially when it concerned an operation like that. If she can't realize that, then she's a royal snot and needs to get her head out of her ass. I mean, would she rather you spend the rest of your life in pain just to satisfy her pettiness?", "NTA - The surgery was needed as soon as possible.\n\nIf it is still a hot button issue after 10 years, you should seriously consider couples counseling.", "Are you saying this issue is 10 years old...? Because if so, reddit is not thr place to seek absolution, therapy (either as a couple or alone or both) is a way better option.", "NTA was a necessary surgery. But what is with all the motorcycle comments, for f\u2019s sake. I have ridden my entire life, same as horses, planes, helicopters, cars, bicycles, worked on ships in Alaska. You name it I have probably tried it. So Alaska, deadliest profession right, they made a show about it. Want to know my life changing injury came from. A drunk driver crushing me into my parked car as I was getting into it. Not from any of the other things, just getting into my car on my residential street. I grew on a ranch outside of Sturgis SD, motorcycle heaven and our injury and death rate per capita is seriously low. Have a better chance of getting injured by a cow. Leave your bias at the door people.", "ESH\n\nYou left for vital, time sensitive surgery - not to go have fun. Sure the timing wasn't ideal, but it happens sometimes.\n\nThat said, maybe with your wife's due date fast approaching you should have laid off the more dangerous activities.", "I\u2019d say maybe light ESH overall, though I genuinely emphasize with your wife here. As others have pointed she to deal with her angry family without her partner after the most traumatic medical procedure in her life. She clearly hasn\u2019t dealt with it the best, hence why she\u2019s not off the hook. But you\u2019re an AH for a different reason then you think. \n\nI\u2019m gonna go against the grain here and say YTA, but not for the surgery that was completely understandable. You\u2019re an AH for riding a motorcycle anywhere near your partner\u2019s due date.\n\nMotorcycle accidents statistically have a fatality rate of nearly 30 times to that of car accidents. Even if they don\u2019t end fatally, you\u2019re also by default a lot more likely to be more seriously injured and out of commission unnecessarily.\n\nThere have actually been a few posts on this forum about partners and motorcycles. There was even one about a boyfriend who (understandably) didn\u2019t want his pregnant partner riding motorcycles. Guess what? The commenters agreed that it was a poor choice for the girlfriend to continue to ride motorcycles.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You needed crucial surgery.\n\nDepending on the entire situation, your wife probably isn't even the AH, either. \n\nI wonder if her family manipulated her into thinking you were a bad guy with this and \"brainwashed\" her a bit.

I'd rather have my husband take me to my preferred hospital over 2 hrs away and still be at the birth, have healthy baby and next day husband go-to a much needed surgery than the other way around. She was probably too hormonal and what could you really do at hospital after baby is born. If baby was breast fed, you can't help, if mom was too tired and needs a break she's in hospital, nurses are there to help. My baby was born 2 months early and I had severe preclampsia. My son was in NICU for weeks and I was in hospital 1 week after birth due to my high BP but guess what my husband was there at the birth and he wanted to go home that night because he was exhausted from no sleep.

We are a valley with a lot of hills and winding roads and you fit 700,000 bikers in one small area and you would think we would would have a very large number of accidents. If you look at it from a scientific perspective or statistics the majority of the death and injury is from inexperienced riders, many with no license and are not wearing a helmet. Wear your gear and head protection and learn how to properly handle a bike and your odds of fatality decrease dramatically.

Everyone knows how dangerous motorcycles are, doctors literally call riders organ donors.\n\nYour wife told you to go because you needed surgery. But she\u2019s allowed to be pissed that you even needed surgery and had to go at all.

To extrapolate a little bit (you made a huge assumption about OP so I think I can too) - maybe OP was really worried about the birth, worried about his baby, worried about his wife?

It was surgery and she had your blessing at the time.

Instead of being \u201cright\u201d or \u201cjustified\u201d think about her feelings.  Being married to my wife has allowed me the amazing prospective of seeing life through the eyes of a woman.

My husband went home.", "YTA for doing something dangerous so close to her due date.", "While reading this my thoughts were that OP is definitely NTA but I wanted to cut his wife some slack because I know a women's hormones are completely wonky right after giving birth so it's not fair to call her an AH just for being a victim of her own uncontrollable emotions in the moment. \n\nBut after reading that this happened 10 years ago! And the wife still brings it up, she is a massive asshole and not a rational person. Personally, I wouldn't put up with this.", "You're not back to 100% perfect right and emotionally normal right after you have a baby, your body is still swirling with hormones and stress. Likely the early onset of post partum depression or anxiety exasperated by the stress of disapproving family members.", "The family manipulating the wife crossed my mind as well. Also, I feel like if OP was gonna have surgery, right after the birth would be the perfect time. I feel like lots of couples have someone stay to help for a bit after the baby is born anyway. At least, it's better than waiting until the child is more mobile and more involvement is needed.", "Exactly. That\u2019s what hit me. She was an AH from the beginning for me though. She told him not to even take her to the hospital so he could make it to his surgery without him asking her to make any compromise. That she turned on him after his surgery and told him she would hold on to her anger and hate forever is just petty and evil. NTA Op and you never were at any point based on your post.", "Seriously? How does this get upvotes?\n\nI fucking hate people on their high horse telling others not to ride a motorcycle and subsequently calling them organ donors.\n\nHe didn't volunteer to travel to Ukraine to fight Russia, he rides a motorcycle.

And to the mom too. \n\nLike this feels like people want to be mad at op because he left his wife after birth but had a seriously compelling reason so they can't make the logical or emotional leap so are settling in this.

No big deal. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>You going to apply that to everything equally or just bikes.\n\nI think I already applied it to getting drunk as much as I'd like to, smoking as much as I'd like to, and hunting while drunks.  I don't do those things because they are an irresponsible thing to do when I have dependents (hunting while drunk is irresponsible enough that I didn't do it even before I had dependents).\n\nI apply it to risk, which is the product of a) likelihood of an adverse event, and b) severity of an adverse event.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Cause auto accidents happen, we are all going to be in one and it's a roll of the dice how bad it is car or motorcycle.\n\nOkay, but if you really think this way then you are either lying to yourself, or you are just really, really poorly educated on how risk and probabilities work.\n\nA motorcyclist is 28 times more likely to die in an accident per mile travelled than somebody in a car.  So sure, it's a roll of the dice either way.  But if you're on a motorcycle, it's also 27 more rolls of the dice.\n\nThe likely severity of injury goes way, way up if you're on a bike vs a car.  So even if the risk of a crash is the same roll of the dice either way (it's not, but let's pretend), the risk is much, much higher.\n\nIf you have dependents, then you are likely one of their most valuable assets. You are one of their primary sources of income, care, companionship, and guidance.  When you risk your safety, you are risking the most valuable asset of your dependents.  If you do that irresponsibly, then you are being irresponsible.\n\nIf you want to do it anyway, fine.  Just go buy a really, really nice life/disability insurance policy.", "Just because there are more dangerous activities out there does not negate the fact that it is still more dangerous to drive a motorcycle than it is to drive a car.", "I do not disagree, but they are the same humans who also see car accidents and do not describe cars as negatively.

I have lived rurally my entire life.  I'm not sure how many hospitals were around us, but at least 7.

He loved to fly. However, once mom got pregnant he stopped. He felt it was too risky. His family comes before a risky hobby. He started flying again once us kids were adults.", "Him riding wasn't in question. So why the hell are we bringing it up? No one asked whether he should have been riding. All the people calling him the AH because he chose to ride the motorcycle. What if he chose to ride it because it made financial sense? Or his wife was perfectly fine with it.

It's a lot different in the US, they don't use the kind of bikes on our streets, the bikes they use are generally like the superbikes we see, their transportation infrastructure is far superior which generally means traffic moves much faster. \n\nThat being said, the OP hasn't provided any specifics about the incident and is being judged based on assumptions. It could turn out that the assumptions are correct but till OP confirms, they are assumptions.", "I know that but my main point is we should confirm any assumptions with info requests instead of judging based on those yet unconfirmed assumptions.", "The miles per driven is a spook stat. First it's fatality rate over 100 million miles driven.

I grew up rurally and my town did have a regional hospital. Still, it\u2019s very common for women to choose to drive an hour and a half to the closest big city to get better facilities and physicians. Plus, these decisions are made with the help of a physician.

I was just pointing out that your argument didn't really hold up.", "Devil's advocate: my father got a motorcycle when I was in middle school specifically BECAUSE he was caring for us. It was cheaper to buy his friends (used in very good condition) motorcycle and ride it than it was to pay for gas/etc. for a second car at the time, and he rode that thing unless it was actively snowing, and stayed home when it did. He went all in on safety gear and inspections and rode that thing as safely as possible. His motorcycle meant my sister and I went to summer camp and didn't have ramen noodles every week.\n\nMotorcycles do have higher odds of accidents and injuries than cars, but there are plenty of those from cars as well.

In fact, the majority of pedestrian-vehicle crashes are due to illegal actions from the pedestrian, the main one being jaywalking.\n\n In one study I found that looked at 7000 pedestrian-vehicle accidents, it was found that 80% of those accidents were the fault of the pedestrian. \n\nComparing motorcycling to walking down a sidewalk is a very bad comparison, at least in the way that it doesn't prove your point. Walking on a legal, designated sidewalk is actually very low risk compared to motorcycling."]}
