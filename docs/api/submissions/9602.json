This was never an issue even though the ride is 2 or so hours. \n\nA couple days before my wife went into labor I had a motorcycle accident and broke my collar bone. I was scheduled for an operation on  a monday morning 1st thing. Sunday evening about 2am my wife wakes me up to tell me her water broke. She also tells me \"Don't worry about it i know you have your operation this morning, I'll just take a cab.\" To which I replied \"thats ridiculous, of course I'll take you.   \nI immediatly gather everything together to drive her to NYU. Everything goes relatively smooth other than 30hrs of labor, our baby came out healthy and i was there to see the birth of my newborn. However, I was unable to cancel my appointment because i didn't want to leave my wifes side. After a bit of time i got through to my Dr who said it is imperative that we have the operation before the bone heals while it is splintered... if we don't they will have to re-break it to set it and it may never heal right. They told me they can get me in right away if i head back home to central NJ. I told her what they said and i asked if it was ok with her. to which she replied excitedly \"of course! you should go!\" by the time I had the operation and got back to the hospital another day or so later her entire family was there and the tension in the air was so think you could cut it with a knife. when I finally got to talk to my wife she said she hated that i left her there all alone to which things got heated and the last thing she said to me before i decided to drop it is\"i hate you for leaving me alone like this at a time that i needed you here and i will probably hate you for the rest of my life for it\" I couldn't even make the argument that \"you told me I should go\" This is a 10 year old argument and we NEVER bring it up cause its such a hot button issue, but it has always been in the back of my head wether i was right to go.

Did she not want you to ride it before the accident?", "NTA. She probably wasn't as bothered about it until she realised her family was bothered about it and then they probably exacerbated everything and her perspective shifted. \n\nBut she told you when she went into labour that you should stay home for your operation, and then she told you to go after the birth.

Life happens and you gotta roll with the punches. You were there through the 30 hour labor and to me, that seems sufficient given that family was with her when you came back. I would assume hormones could play a part in reacting that way in the moment, but for the next 10 years after that? That kind of reaction is absurdly disproportionate.\n\nI dont understand why anything mattered other than the baby. To me, the birth of the child is the only focus.\n\nIf your collar bone were to heal improperly it could have impaired your ability to do things with your child for the rest of your life. \n\nDoes she have difficulty being alone in general?\n\nIdk that just seems fcking ludicrous", "It sounds like she was happy for you to go until her family got involved.

You had to take care of a critical medical issue!!! Of course you didn\u2019t plan it anymore than she planned to go into labor that same day. \n\nSorry you\u2019re still suffering on this one. But I hope you can both let it go. 10 years is a long time to hold a grudge.", "NTA - you had a fucking broken collarbone!  How long did she expect you to put off surgery ffs?!  You must have been in pain that whole time.  Let go of feeling bad - you\u2019re allowed to take care of yourself too.", "NAH. The timing was unfortunate, but you had to also fix the bone so you could be strong to look after your child. Your wife gave her blessing for you to go, but also childbirth is rough and it\u2019s valid she regretted it later. However she did have her family there. It\u2019s just a rough situation and emotions are valid on all sides. 10 years later this should be water under the bridge.", "NTA for all the sensible reasons. That being said, how are you mentally coping with staying with someone who's hated you for 10 years and will hate you for the rest of her life? I think if she didn't actually hate you, this argument would have been addressed and resolved 10 years ago.", "I feel like it\u2019s poor decision making to ride a motorcycle when your wife is about to give birth to prevent this exact situation or worse, but based on your question NTA for getting a surgery you needed when you needed it. I do think it was a preventable situation caused by your own choices that was ultimately clearly detrimental to your wife.", "NTA. I know that she just gave birth at the time, but that doesn't make her health more important than yours. Especially when it concerned an operation like that. If she can't realize that, then she's a royal snot and needs to get her head out of her ass. I mean, would she rather you spend the rest of your life in pain just to satisfy her pettiness?", "NTA - The surgery was needed as soon as possible.\n\nIf it is still a hot button issue after 10 years, you should seriously consider couples counseling.", "Are you saying this issue is 10 years old...? Because if so, reddit is not thr place to seek absolution, therapy (either as a couple or alone or both) is a way better option.", "NTA was a necessary surgery. But what is with all the motorcycle comments, for f\u2019s sake. I have ridden my entire life, same as horses, planes, helicopters, cars, bicycles, worked on ships in Alaska. You name it I have probably tried it. So Alaska, deadliest profession right, they made a show about it. Want to know my life changing injury came from. A drunk driver crushing me into my parked car as I was getting into it. Not from any of the other things, just getting into my car on my residential street. I grew on a ranch outside of Sturgis SD, motorcycle heaven and our injury and death rate per capita is seriously low. Have a better chance of getting injured by a cow. Leave your bias at the door people.", "ESH\n\nYou left for vital, time sensitive surgery - not to go have fun. Sure the timing wasn't ideal, but it happens sometimes.\n\nThat said, maybe with your wife's due date fast approaching you should have laid off the more dangerous activities.", "I\u2019d say maybe light ESH overall, though I genuinely emphasize with your wife here. As others have pointed she to deal with her angry family without her partner after the most traumatic medical procedure in her life. She clearly hasn\u2019t dealt with it the best, hence why she\u2019s not off the hook. But you\u2019re an AH for a different reason then you think. \n\nI\u2019m gonna go against the grain here and say YTA, but not for the surgery that was completely understandable. You\u2019re an AH for riding a motorcycle anywhere near your partner\u2019s due date.\n\nMotorcycle accidents statistically have a fatality rate of nearly 30 times to that of car accidents. Even if they don\u2019t end fatally, you\u2019re also by default a lot more likely to be more seriously injured and out of commission unnecessarily.\n\nThere have actually been a few posts on this forum about partners and motorcycles. There was even one about a boyfriend who (understandably) didn\u2019t want his pregnant partner riding motorcycles. Guess what? The commenters agreed that it was a poor choice for the girlfriend to continue to ride motorcycles.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You needed crucial surgery.\n\nDepending on the entire situation, your wife probably isn't even the AH, either. \n\nI wonder if her family manipulated her into thinking you were a bad guy with this and \"brainwashed\" her a bit.

I'd rather have my husband take me to my preferred hospital over 2 hrs away and still be at the birth, have healthy baby and next day husband go-to a much needed surgery than the other way around. She was probably too hormonal and what could you really do at hospital after baby is born. If baby was breast fed, you can't help, if mom was too tired and needs a break she's in hospital, nurses are there to help. My baby was born 2 months early and I had severe preclampsia. My son was in NICU for weeks and I was in hospital 1 week after birth due to my high BP but guess what my husband was there at the birth and he wanted to go home that night because he was exhausted from no sleep.

We are a valley with a lot of hills and winding roads and you fit 700,000 bikers in one small area and you would think we would would have a very large number of accidents. If you look at it from a scientific perspective or statistics the majority of the death and injury is from inexperienced riders, many with no license and are not wearing a helmet. Wear your gear and head protection and learn how to properly handle a bike and your odds of fatality decrease dramatically.

But she\u2019s allowed to be pissed that you even needed surgery and had to go at all.

To extrapolate a little bit (you made a huge assumption about OP so I think I can too) - maybe OP was really worried about the birth, worried about his baby, worried about his wife?

Your actually in more danger as a pedestrian walking down the sidewalk then driving a motorcycle.", "If you're a pedestrian that gets hit, you are more likely to die. However, about 70,000 pedestrians are hit per year in the USA (and as far as I'm aware this number includes accidents where there weren't injuries) and there are around 111,000 motorcycle accidents per year. So the odds of surviving is lower IF you get hit as a pedestrian, but the odds of actually being in an accident in the first place is much higher as a motorcyclist."]}
