She was a NYC resident for years before we met. Her Dr was from NYU and she was adamant about wanting to have the baby delivered with a Dr she was familiar with. We're all good with that. This was never an issue even though the ride is 2 or so hours. \n\nA couple days before my wife went into labor I had a motorcycle accident and broke my collar bone. I was scheduled for an operation on  a monday morning 1st thing. Sunday evening about 2am my wife wakes me up to tell me her water broke. She also tells me \"Don't worry about it i know you have your operation this morning, I'll just take a cab.\" To which I replied \"thats ridiculous, of course I'll take you.   \nI immediatly gather everything together to drive her to NYU. Everything goes relatively smooth other than 30hrs of labor, our baby came out healthy and i was there to see the birth of my newborn. However, I was unable to cancel my appointment because i didn't want to leave my wifes side. After a bit of time i got through to my Dr who said it is imperative that we have the operation before the bone heals while it is splintered... if we don't they will have to re-break it to set it and it may never heal right. They told me they can get me in right away if i head back home to central NJ. I told her what they said and i asked if it was ok with her. to which she replied excitedly \"of course! you should go!\" by the time I had the operation and got back to the hospital another day or so later her entire family was there and the tension in the air was so think you could cut it with a knife. when I finally got to talk to my wife she said she hated that i left her there all alone to which things got heated and the last thing she said to me before i decided to drop it is\"i hate you for leaving me alone like this at a time that i needed you here and i will probably hate you for the rest of my life for it\" I couldn't even make the argument that \"you told me I should go\" This is a 10 year old argument and we NEVER bring it up cause its such a hot button issue, but it has always been in the back of my head wether i was right to go. Her family says i should have stayed and my friends say i did the right thing so i need an unbiased opinion so i can put this to rest for my own sanity.", "created_utc": 1676002084, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10yfsjo/aita_for_leaving_my_wife_at_the_hospital_with_our/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn't leave to go have fun. You left to have vital surgery. Your wife was dealing with post-partum hormones and was vulnerable to disapproving family members. If this lingering resentment is harming your relationship, she may need to see a therapist.\n\nAlso, question, how did she feel about the motorcycle? Did she not want you to ride it before the accident?", "NTA. She probably wasn't as bothered about it until she realised her family was bothered about it and then they probably exacerbated everything and her perspective shifted. \n\nBut she told you when she went into labour that you should stay home for your operation, and then she told you to go after the birth. So NTA, because she encouraged it. \n\nShe might not have realised she needed you there until she was gone, but she can't blame you for that - neither of you realised it would be a problem at the time.", "You are NTA for not being a mind reader.", "Imma go with NTA. a broken collarbone is no joke and even your Dr said it's important to do the operation as soon as possible. Your wife should be more understanding.", "NTA.  Your wife is being unreasonable and unfair.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't leave to go to the bar with the guys, you literally left to go have important surgery.", "NTA. You needed the surgery. Life happens and you gotta roll with the punches. You were there through the 30 hour labor and to me, that seems sufficient given that family was with her when you came back. I would assume hormones could play a part in reacting that way in the moment, but for the next 10 years after that? That kind of reaction is absurdly disproportionate.\n\nI dont understand why anything mattered other than the baby. To me, the birth of the child is the only focus.\n\nIf your collar bone were to heal improperly it could have impaired your ability to do things with your child for the rest of your life. \n\nDoes she have difficulty being alone in general?\n\nIdk that just seems fcking ludicrous", "It sounds like she was happy for you to go until her family got involved. To me it sounds like her family manipulated her to make you seem like the AH when your not. Maybe I'm wrong but she sounded supportive before her family got there", "NTA, you were having surgery not a vacation. I could understand her being upset in the moment because it\u2019s an emotional time but ten years later? Ma\u2019am, get over it, he needed surgery.", "NTA", "NTA. You had to take care of a critical medical issue!!! Of course you didn\u2019t plan it anymore than she planned to go into labor that same day. \n\nSorry you\u2019re still suffering on this one. But I hope you can both let it go. 10 years is a long time to hold a grudge.", "NTA - you had a fucking broken collarbone!  How long did she expect you to put off surgery ffs?!  You must have been in pain that whole time.  Let go of feeling bad - you\u2019re allowed to take care of yourself too.", "NAH. The timing was unfortunate, but you had to also fix the bone so you could be strong to look after your child. Your wife gave her blessing for you to go, but also childbirth is rough and it\u2019s valid she regretted it later. However she did have her family there. It\u2019s just a rough situation and emotions are valid on all sides. 10 years later this should be water under the bridge.", "NTA for all the sensible reasons. That being said, how are you mentally coping with staying with someone who's hated you for 10 years and will hate you for the rest of her life? I think if she didn't actually hate you, this argument would have been addressed and resolved 10 years ago.", "I feel like it\u2019s poor decision making to ride a motorcycle when your wife is about to give birth to prevent this exact situation or worse, but based on your question NTA for getting a surgery you needed when you needed it. I do think it was a preventable situation caused by your own choices that was ultimately clearly detrimental to your wife.", "NTA. I know that she just gave birth at the time, but that doesn't make her health more important than yours. Especially when it concerned an operation like that. If she can't realize that, then she's a royal snot and needs to get her head out of her ass. I mean, would she rather you spend the rest of your life in pain just to satisfy her pettiness?", "NTA - The surgery was needed as soon as possible.\n\nIf it is still a hot button issue after 10 years, you should seriously consider couples counseling.", "Are you saying this issue is 10 years old...? Because if so, reddit is not thr place to seek absolution, therapy (either as a couple or alone or both) is a way better option.", "NTA was a necessary surgery. But what is with all the motorcycle comments, for f\u2019s sake. I have ridden my entire life, same as horses, planes, helicopters, cars, bicycles, worked on ships in Alaska. You name it I have probably tried it. So Alaska, deadliest profession right, they made a show about it. Want to know my life changing injury came from. A drunk driver crushing me into my parked car as I was getting into it. Not from any of the other things, just getting into my car on my residential street. I grew on a ranch outside of Sturgis SD, motorcycle heaven and our injury and death rate per capita is seriously low. Have a better chance of getting injured by a cow. Leave your bias at the door people.", "ESH\n\nYou left for vital, time sensitive surgery - not to go have fun. Sure the timing wasn't ideal, but it happens sometimes.\n\nThat said, maybe with your wife's due date fast approaching you should have laid off the more dangerous activities.", "I\u2019d say maybe light ESH overall, though I genuinely emphasize with your wife here. As others have pointed she to deal with her angry family without her partner after the most traumatic medical procedure in her life. She clearly hasn\u2019t dealt with it the best, hence why she\u2019s not off the hook. But you\u2019re an AH for a different reason then you think. \n\nI\u2019m gonna go against the grain here and say YTA, but not for the surgery that was completely understandable. You\u2019re an AH for riding a motorcycle anywhere near your partner\u2019s due date.\n\nMotorcycle accidents statistically have a fatality rate of nearly 30 times to that of car accidents. Even if they don\u2019t end fatally, you\u2019re also by default a lot more likely to be more seriously injured and out of commission unnecessarily.\n\nThere have actually been a few posts on this forum about partners and motorcycles. There was even one about a boyfriend who (understandably) didn\u2019t want his pregnant partner riding motorcycles. Guess what? The commenters agreed that it was a poor choice for the girlfriend to continue to ride motorcycles.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don\u2019t think your wife is TA here either\u2026 she just went through something traumatic, her hormones are insane right now, and she was obviously persuaded by her family that you did something wrong.", "NTA", "NTA- You weren't going to play poker and drink with the boys. You needed crucial surgery.\n\nDepending on the entire situation, your wife probably isn't even the AH, either. \n\nI wonder if her family manipulated her into thinking you were a bad guy with this and \"brainwashed\" her a bit. She had no problem, until they were there. It seems like they made your wife, who had just given birth, worry and hate you for nothing. Some pregnant women and women who have just given birth aren't necessarily known for rational thinking.", "NTA. It was an urgent medical requirement for you and she should have been honest with you if she didn't want you to leave.", "NTA. I'd rather have my husband take me to my preferred hospital over 2 hrs away and still be at the birth, have healthy baby and next day husband go-to a much needed surgery than the other way around. She was probably too hormonal and what could you really do at hospital after baby is born. If baby was breast fed, you can't help, if mom was too tired and needs a break she's in hospital, nurses are there to help. My baby was born 2 months early and I had severe preclampsia. My son was in NICU for weeks and I was in hospital 1 week after birth due to my high BP but guess what my husband was there at the birth and he wanted to go home that night because he was exhausted from no sleep. Was I mad, no. Did I feel alone, no because I was in hospital with all nurses helping me and my son. NTA you were there for most important part and you had reason to leave.. for an important surgery you needed", "NTA.  The surgery wasn't optional, you needed to have it before your bones could heal so that you didn't end up with long term issues.  Getting bones rebroken is not minor.", "NTA, it's patently absurd that SHE demanded to have the baby so far from home AND is now acting like you went to a party instead of having an urgently needed surgery!\n\nShe owes you a massive apology and her family the truth!", "You are NTA for following a Drs advice to avoid a permanent disability. I can\u2019t believe this is an argument.", "NTA but if she's still using this 10 years later to win arguments or make you do stuff, then that's a big red flag. Counselling urgently needed.", "NTA, you could have had permanent damage if you didn't go to surgery right away... like never being able to hold your baby because of the pain level damage. A broken collar bone is no joke, and when they don't heal right it can seriously f up your life. You were there, you saw your baby born, you were with her through the labor, through all of the important parts. You didn't leave to do something fun or because you were tired or you just didn't want to be there.", "It's not like you left mid birth, she wanted a taxi and you took her, you were with her the whole tike and you made sure she and baby were healthy and all OK.\n\nShe was fully aware you needed treatment and told you to go. She wasn't alone she had her family there.\n\nHer behaviour was unfair.\n\nNTA", "NTA your wife is unreasonable and crazy....have fun for another 10 years", "NTA\n\nNow if the operation in question had been a vasectomy...", "NTA. You were told you could go and it was surgery. If she really didn't want you to go she should have actually said something about it rather than said go.", "NTA and her family convinced her you abandoned her while you were gone. She really needs to get over herself.", "Agreed that N T A for getting surgery, but... honestly, OP, YTA for needing it. Why were you doing something so high risk when your wife was at the end of the pregnancy, thus upping the odds you wouldn't be able to be there for her? Couldn't you lay off the bike for a little while? Have you talked about this in the context of being around for your wife and family? \n\nDo you know what paramedics call motorcyclists? Road pizza / Organ donors.", "[deleted]", "Absolutely. The fact that OP even managed to get as far as through 30 hours of labour with a broken collarbone makes him a hero and that's what his wife has got to be made to see.  she is being utterly ridiculous and I agree with the people who say that is probably her friends and family who put this idea into her head that he was in the wrong. After all she had been happy with him going for the surgery beforehand. She sounds a bit flaky", "That was my thoughts exactly.", "What's with it is average rates of motorcycle injury are about 1% per year, meaning if you ride for 10 years you have about a 10% likelihood of injury. 80% of those accidents are fatal. \n\nA ranch in SD probably is far lower than the average rates, and the odds that OP lives on a ranch in SD are also fairly low. So it's nice that it's safe(r) for folks in Sturgis, but other folks \"bias\" is also your situation being a major outlier. It's not so much for the majority of riders.\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your accident and hope you are managing OK. Greetings from a fellow chronic pain haver - it sucks!", "Donorcycles", "Are you OP?", "I manage okay mostly ignore as I can and get a lot of massage therapy. But Sturgis has the biggest motorcycle rally in the world. We are a valley with a lot of hills and winding roads and you fit 700,000 bikers in one small area and you would think we would would have a very large number of accidents. If you look at it from a scientific perspective or statistics the majority of the death and injury is from inexperienced riders, many with no license and are not wearing a helmet. Wear your gear and head protection and learn how to properly handle a bike and your odds of fatality decrease dramatically. I have been on the back of a back when it laid down as a teenager and my helmet and leathers made it to so I had a sprained wrist and knee. Not enough to give it up for me personally.", "Donor kebab if they hit a fence"]}
