It's cool that I didn't get an invite, since I also could not have come due to the cost, but I only found out from another friend 9 months later.\nShe didn't end up getting married, and blew everything off in the last minute.", "NTA saving for your house deposit is significantly more important \u2014 whether that makes you an asshole or not is basically irrelevant.", "Please read my post in fully before accusing me of lying or not doing my research.", "I hate to tell you this, but that is more than likely the response you'll get. Don't be afraid of it, accept it. Putting your entire life on hold to go to a wedding is monumentally irresponsible.\n\nPut that 10k towards a house and a start towards your future child's future, and then ask said child down the line if they think you should have shelled out that kinda money instead of doing right by yourself and them.\n\nYour kid will likely at least be happy that their parent isn't a doormat and is willing to stand up for themselves and put their responsibilities first.", "And to that your answer might be: \"Indeed! And that's why I expect she'll understand.\"", "Thank you for explaining. Island hopping will certainly increase the prices", "NTA. I'm Aussie, so I sympathise in regards to the distance and expense to get to certain other countries. Seeing all these replies being like \"what? You can fly anywhere for less than x if you plan well\" seem to be missing that the wedding date is set, it might be set during a time of year when travel to that area becomes more expensive and you have no choice to travel at a less expensive time, or to a less expensive place and stay in less expensive accommodation if there's limited options.", "I don't see anywhere that her partner agrees. OP actually said that if it wasn't for her objecting, he would go. \n\n\nOn the other hand, she keeps saying things like \"we wouldn't even spend all that money on ourselves for a vacation\", which I think is a problem. It's not a vacation, it's a trip to visit family. \n\n\nI think the post was framed in a misleading way. They are not spending 10k because the sister chose to have an extravagant destination wedding, they are spending 10k to visit his home country that he hasn't seen in years, for a once in a lifetime event like a sibling's wedding.\n\n\nI mean, if not for this, then when? Are they never going there again?", "It takes a while but eventually you do stop caring. Build your own life and own your choices. If people ask why you don't visit, be honest but not snarky.

Don't expect your 90 year old grandma to make the flight.)", "NTA\n\nYou live abroad.

They struggled in every way. Then, one of the spouses got a fantastic job that finally acknowledged the education from the motherland and got them set up with a decent pay, the ability to cut down to a single job each, guaranteed US citizenship, and excellent insurance. The probationary period was just a month in at the time of this story. In comes the toxic family. \"Your one and only younger sister is getting married. It's your responsibility to take care of us but since you've run off to another country to live in luxury, the least you can do is attend.\" The wedding date wasn't set yet, so the young couple requested holding off for just 2 more months so the job would no longer be probationary and their roots could finally take hold. There was another date that would have worked for both the groom's and bride's side (from religious perspectives as well). Now at this point, the entitled parents and sister had already come to the US to their home, abused the hell out of them (a couple of times life threatening), shopped on their dime, and used the baby and faaamily as an excuse to get both a Niagara Falls and extended Disney/SeaWorld/Universal trip out of them. But because of the request (how dare they!) the entitled family doubled down on the earlier date as a test of loyalty. They ended up going (the newly hired spouse taking a few days but the other having to take a month off from multiple jobs) and risking the life they finally were getting a grip on. The families joining in marriage were actually quite well off financially and in terms of societal status, so they wanted for nothing. But the selfish people who own their own car and live in America, aka this young struggling family, were clearly living the luxury life and therefore required to bring regular and wedding gifts for everyone you could imagine (their full luggage quota was mostly gifts, there was also an expectation to leave behind their nicer clothes and things for whoever wants them there...they live in the US, they have permanent access to luxury). This wedding was halfway across the world, took at least 2 days to travel between the countries, and so many vaccinations required (kind of difficult, especially when there is no insurance), not to mention no consideration of whether international travel with a baby was even something they could or should, much less want to, do. They had been trapped in the abuse to such an extent that not going was never an option.\n\nBut the universe watched out for them. Turns out the boss of the boss of the newly hired employee was from the same motherland and understood more than one could ever expect. When the request escalated to his level, he weighed the qualification credentials and the excellent employee he was getting against the guaranteed job termination and decided to work it out so that there was a penalty but not loss of employment. Eventually it all worked out, in a way that one could not have imagined, much less hoped for, but it worked out.", "They can suck it up and deal with it. If its an issue, its their problem."]}
