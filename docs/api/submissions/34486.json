A gift is a gift, and you're financially treading water.\n\nThat said, if Mark is rewriting history and going so far to suggest you start payments- your relationship with Mark is pretty much. If you don't pay him back small amounts, he will hold it against you. If you pay him back, he might be okay with maintaining a relationship but you will likely be rightfully resentful and distrustful. That isn't to say starve yourself or be on the verge of homelessness, but that's the reality.", "Definitely NTA.

Ultimately, this is him panicking and applying pressure needlessly to an already communicated agreement previously established.", "NTA\n\nIt was a bit daft of him to say it was a gift and didn't need paying back.  He really should have said it was a loan but don't worry about paying it back until you are able to and there is no time limit.  \n\nAs it is he gave you the money and said it was a gift.
