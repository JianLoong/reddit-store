Grandpa made a big deal out of nothing on a possibly unpopular side note, feeding your kid soda on a regular basis (or anyone) isn\u2019t good.", "This grandparent sucks and you should scream from the rooftops defending your child. This has nothing to do with your child being autistic and everything to do with your grandparent being a huge AH. \n\nTell every single family member who will listen his stupid and controlling this is. \n\nalso tell your grandpa unless he apologizes he can spend every celebration alone by himself because he\u2019s a bully. Then get all your family members on your side!", "NTA", "NTA - your grandfather should learn to mind his own business and not police what other people choose to eat and drink. If anyone ruined anything, he did. Your mom needs to back down and back you up. If this is hard for her to get, it's time to question the family dynamics between her and her father and take a nice hard look at whether everything is nice and healthy there.", "NTA your grandfather ruined it.\n\nTell your mum that no one else had their drink choice policed. Just your son. Why is that?", "Grampa is the A.\n\nI did go on a date once where I only wanted water. The guy took it as an insult. Me thinking he was cheep. I told him I had been planning on having dessert. Now I changed my mind. He wonders why he didn't get a 2nd date.\n\nAnyways. We are always trying to get children to drink more water! Soda is a horrible habit that too many of us have.\n\nThe only thing I can possibly think...my daughter's children have a great grandfather. Going with great grampa to get a soda is a rare and wonderful treat. Maybe, for your grandfather, soda has special memories?\n\nMaybe, if your son ever faces a situation like this again, request the soda to go? Soda is literally...restaurants make so much money on soda. It's not even like that much bang for Grampa's buck!\n\nWhat a weird thing for his great grandfather to be a jerk about? Your son did absolutely nothing wrong.\n\nDid your grandfather grow up with food insecurity?", "Sounds like grandpa comes from the generation of you eat what I give you or else. Not healthy. And your mom flipping? She\u2019s still acting like a kid afraid of her dad. Shame on her. NTA you are.", "NTA obviously \n\nAll i can say is literally what the fuck. Why does anyone even care. There are so many other things to think about than someone elses soft drink choice *eye roll* \n\nGood on your son for drinking water, its good for you. \n\nFrom a nanny\u2019s POV: Before trying to control what a kid does, i ask myself, \n\n1) is this hurting anyone now or in the future? \n\n2) Is this legal/safe/moral? \n\n3) Are they happy? \n\n4) Why do i want it to change? \n\n If those questions are satisfied then so am i. Apply it here and granda seems even more unhinged. \n\nPick your battles because some things matter and some things don\u2019t. This doesn\u2019t matter. Its a glass of water. Let the boy drink for fucks sake.", "NTA \n\nyour son is autistic so it makes the situation worse. But even without that\u2026 if a kid just wants to drink water : let him drink water. This shouldn\u2019t even be a subject first.", "NTA \n\nYou're not the only person who doesn't understand this. What the fucking fuck? I had friends growing up who whose whole family would order water because the soda cost money. And I had other friends whose family would announce it was okay to ordee a soda. So like that's a thing, I guess. But I've never ever seen someone get insulted you chose water. I'm [probably] not autistic and I prefer water over other drinks. I know a lot of people (2 autistic, the rest neurotypical) who haaaaate fizzy drinks. Water is also best for you and literally necessary to stay alive. Choosing water is so normal and so common I can't believe he even noticed. \n\nYou and your son didn't do anything wrong.
