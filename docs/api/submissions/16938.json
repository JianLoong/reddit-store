It's great you have a good relationship with your MIL but she's ultimately his parent and having an occasional personal gift only from him is incredibly normal. It seems like he may be generally glad that you 2 have a good relationship, but he'd like some recognition that she's his mother, not the mother of both of you.

He is so glad that I have her as my mom as well. That wasn't always the case and it took time. Jealousy is not a pretty look, and your husband should be happy and proud that you two have each other and get along. Reddit is FILLED with horror stories of MIL and DIL relationship problems.

Wtf is his problem?", "NTA \n\nYou love your mil as if she was your own mother and she feels the same about you. Does your husband realize the gift that is? Most men dream of that.\n\nI'm in the same situation. My mother hated me and was very abusive and my mil took me in as if I was her own. My husband never got jealous like yours. He is such an asshole to throw that in your face. My mil  passed away a few weeks ago. What I would give for just one more Mother's Day with her. \n\nPlan a special day or meal with your mil alone. Dinner would be good so you can leave your husband out of it and make it obvious he can't come.", "NTA-he\u2019s jealous about something and you need to talk together to get to the bottom of it.

Have you been giving joint gifts the last 14 years?", "I want to say NTA but kind of feel like ESH. \n\nYou should be able to feel like you can have a special relationship with her, but I think you should both communicate about it better so you can be aware if there's boundaries that he feels uncomfortable with you crossing. If money is an issue, he should've thought about the gift with you in mind - maybe talked about it with you but it isn't like it's Christmas, so you shouldn't feel obligated to get some $500 gift. Maybe get her a card or something smaller that's affordable or you find cute. You're NTA because you have a certain feeling about it. I think YTA if he's brought this up in the past that your relationship with her might be hurting his with her or something. Need more context. \n\nIt sucks and I feel for you though. I don't have a relationship with mine either.", "Definitely NTA. He knew you wanted to get her a gift too, and probably knew how much you care about her. If he really felt uncomfortable with you buying her something, he should have discussed it with you.", "NTA. Mother's day is about celebrating mothers, it doesn't HAVE to be your mother. And if his mom is like a mother figure to you, you are in the right to be upset that you can't buy her a gift.", "NTA for being hurt.  However you would be if you don\u2019t let it go and let him have this one.", "NTA, but your hubby is! He KNOWS your situation. He knows everything you went through with your mom. He knows how much you love his mom and you are so thankful for that relationship. And he has the nerve to say.. NOT YOUR MOM, MY MOM!! While he can get his mom anything at anytime, it\u2019s the fact that he\u2019s never taken an interest in it before, even though you asked him, then boom gets it.

He can buy his mother a mother's day gift if he wants, even without telling you. It's his mom, not yours.

You are seprrate people with your own relationship to her. If you want to celebrate  your mil you don't have to buy a gift.

And I\u2019m very sorry - if you can accept that on the internet, that you had a abusive mother. You obviously have a bond to your mother in law. She sounds like an amazing mom. Perhaps you can make her your own special gift? Even some flowers you pick, go a long way. If she loves you like a mother, she will love anything you give her. Maybe even write her a thoughtful letter. I bet she\u2019d cherish that over any gift. You\u2019re not the Asshole for your feelings - no one but you knows how you feel and your feelings are valid. He may have snapped in that moment thinking he already did a great job. As someone with an abusive parent, people with supportive parents don\u2019t usually understand.", "This is beyond Reddit\u2019s pay grade. My own mother was abusive and contradictory, and I had to get a lot of therapy for that. He didn\u2019t get his mother a gift AT you. He wasn\u2019t trying to rub it in your face.

Also, color me doubtful that he felt the need to say it was his own mom for no reason whatsoever, and in her post she doesn't say unprompted either... in any event I'm thinking that this just should not be a big deal at all, him buying his mom a present should not be a subject of consternation, and OP making it that is problematic.", "It's so weird to me because I love when my friends call my mom, mom.

How did this turn into him villainizing her? Are husbands not allowed to buy a gift for his own mom? The fact op is coming here to complain about it is what's weird.

I said I wondered if he did it to get the task off my shoulders. Which I would appreciate wholeheartedly.

This year he just bought something on Amazon\u2026 it\u2019s weird for our family. Hope you can understand.", "It\u2019s super childish for her to be upset he bought his mom a gift.

Context matters.", "He\u2019s allowed to get his mom a present, op is asking if she\u2019s an asshole for being upset which no, pretty reasonable. They ALWAYS do it together and instead of the husband sitting her down respectfully and explaining that he wants to do something special for his own mom this once, he blindsided her and made a rude remark instead of actually explaining.", "I\u2019m not sure which comment you mean. I did see a comment by OP saying she wouldn\u2019t feel upset if he\u2019d just told her. If he had plans to get a gift on his own, why not tell her that when she first asked about Mother\u2019s Day plans?\n\nI think it\u2019s the delivery in the \u201cshe\u2019s my mom, not yours.\u201d Husband knows that his mom and wife have a mother/daughter bond, and he knows his wife\u2019s traumas and difficulty around this day. So his comment isn\u2019t innocuous, it\u2019s emotionally and negatively charged. I think if she questioned him, it was about why he suddenly changed gears after eleven years without giving her a heads-up so she would at least have more time to plan a gift herself.", "I get that he acted out of character.  My point is that you should try to find out why - that\u2019s the really issue, not who bought the bird feeder or who picked out the cake plate.  Have you asked him?", "She can get her own gift. It\u2019s his mother. She needs to get over it.", "NTA. I don\u2019t think your the AH for this. You\u2019ve been together a long time, she\u2019s your MIL and it sounds like this is a mutual relationship you both feel where it\u2019s like mother-daughter. That seems pretty normal to me and I don\u2019t see the issue with wanting to come up with a gift for her. Your husband should talk to you about how he feels instead of lashing out and saying things such as this. It\u2019s nasty.", "Adult siblings usually give their mothers separate gifts no? Why didn\u2019t OP just pick something herself?", "YTA\n\nGet her another gift if you like.", "YTA. You don't get to co-opt his relationship with his mother. You can share her sure, but that does not mean you get to dictate or get hurt because he *checks notes* bought his own mother a gift for mother's day. No one is stopping you from getting her a gift. Budget is tight? Make her something. If his mum truly is as important to you as you say she is, then you would focus on her and what you can do for her, rather than how you feel about it or the fact that she is his mum and not yours. You don't get to make your trauma his trauma, and by extensions, his mum's trauma. Instead of being happy you have a mother figure in your life now, you're instead trying to take it away from your husband as if he can only have a relationship with his own mother with you involved.", "wow what a move on his part.

She can't buy a separate gift.", "A very very soft YTA. it IS his mom, hes known her since, well, birth and you only for 14 so years. Yet u call her mom which, sorry but if I had a husband calling MY mom HIS mom I'd be a little weirded out. Especially with your abusive backstory, it kinda sounds like she's your medicine or you're replacing ur own mom instead of getting help for your passed trauma. It especially sounds like that since you got seriously angry about ur husband simply buying a gift for HIS OWN MOM. That's perfectly reasonable for a son to do. and it is a tad reasonable for him to get so protective and territorial of his mom and maybe a bit weirded out that his wife Is acting like his mom is hers. So.. get help some other way girlie. Therapy, meds, whatever u need.", "YTA - In what reality does he need to talk to you before he buys his own mother a gift for Mother's Day? Sucks that yours sucks, and its awesome you & his mom have such a great relationship -- but you have *zero* reason or right to be upset with him here. No listed previous issues over MIL leads me to conclude the \"it's my mom not yours\" was his direct response to you *being upset he bought his own mother a gift without running it by YOU* rather than his general outlook on your closeness. If so, then you've used it disingenuously here to cast him as petty or jealous instead of correctly answering you why its ok for him to choose & buy her a gift on his own. He's married but he's still a son, so he 100\u2105 gets to pick a gift for his own mother without your input whatsoever. Simply, everything's not about you and he's done nothing here to \"hurt\" you. The fact that you usually choose together & money's tight doesn't change anything. Combined it comes across as justification to insert yourself into Main Character status in a mother-son relationship that doesn't require you, even as it welcomes you. Pot her a flower & bake her a lasagna if money's that tight; or else thank your husband for taking care of it ahead of time and soothe your feathers. \n\nI cannot imagine my spouse being \"hurt\" when I walk in with a Mother's Day gift for my mom. I would assume he was kidding at first, then I'd tell him exactly what yours told you once I realized he was serious.", "NTA\n\nWhat is up with these comments. Yea great that is his mom and not hers technically. But she's been calling her mom for years and are apparently very close. Does the fact that she didn't come out of her vagina mean so much to everyone here. That's her mom too now. Husband and the people commenting here can suck it. \n\nTo address what the husband did. Nothing wrong with buying a gift on his own. But in a marriage communication is key. Why didn't he say something to op all the times she asked him. Or before buying it cos he knows she's been asking about it. Especially if the norm is to buy the gift together.  \n\nOP, with the comment your husband made and the his actions there's something deeper going on with him. Idk if he's jealous or something but you need to have a chat with him.", "NTA in any way. And your husbands coment is just awful, especially knowing that his mother is basically the only mother you have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut INFO: How did you handle mothers day the last 13 years? It's very odd to me that this problem popped up ater such a long time in your relationship.", "NTA - super confused why people are accusing you of trying to steal his personal relationship with his mom, when you usually do gifts together and you mentioned you have a super close motherly relationship with her. We always hear how marriage is about marrying \u201cinto the family\u201d and essentially merging families, I can see if the husband suddenly pulled the \u201cbut shes MY mom not yours\u201d angle and got her a generic amazon gift without telling OP that OP would be taken aback by that. None of this is a big deal but I really dont like how some YTA comments cant empathize with the fact that you\u2019d be confused why he would do this behind your back. Some commenters are right, it could be a sign that hes not as comfy with your tightness with his mom as you previously thought, or he has some hidden feelings about it.", "NTA. I have been married to my husband for 17 years and together for 21.

All I can chalk it up to is that none of these people are married or have close relationships with their inlaws.", "NTA- so, my personal experience is probably clouding how I see this but I end up buying most of the gifts for my husband\u2019s family.  If I\u2019m stuck, I let him know and we work together on it.  We\u2019re married and when it comes to certain things, like gift giving, we function as a unit.  \n\nI am also close with my mother in law.  I am fortunate to have a good relationship with my own mom but I very much consider MIL a second mother.  If my husband bought her something and then threw \u201cit\u2019s my mom!\u201d In my face, I\u2019d be pissed.  I think it\u2019s that second part I take issue with.  It was really uncalled for, on your husband\u2019s part.  AND especially since he knows it\u2019s a hard day for you.  He was really being a jerk.  \n\nWrite your mother in law a note and let her know how much you love her.  She will treasure that as much as a gift.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is your problem again?", "Info - You said that money was very tight.

I can understand him wanting to celebrate his mother but he should find a way to balance your needs as well.", "NAH. \n\nYou can still get her a gift from you, he can give his gift from him without consulting you. \n\nIt is his mum, but I\u2019m sure she has enough love for the both of you!

Comments on this subreddit really love to psychoanalyze every person based on one post. I think your husband should be able to pick out a present for his mom by himself, but I think it's an AH move for him to say that he doesn't know what to get when you asked him. If he really wanted to get her something himself then why not just tell you instead of blindsiding you by getting one when you already made it clear that you wanted to pick one out together.", "The guy had an idea and clicked a couple buttons on Amazon.

You consider it nice to sit down together and buy her something, but he wanted to buy her something by himself.", "Im gonna go against the grain here and say NTA. If you have been giving joint gifts the last 11 years, your husband could have at least communicated to you that he wanted to do it alone this year. I don't take this as you hijacking his mom but more that you're hurt by the sudden lack of communication on his part.", "Bake MIL some cookies.", "Yea soft YTA.

OP can get her own gift, and agree even if it's something crafty/handmade if they're on a budget that would be very meaningful too", "That was my thought too, that maybe leaving OP out of the gift buying process this year was thoughtless but not intentional and then when OP expressed feeling hurt by it he acted defensive and said that rude comment. \n\nI think he was wrong to do that and OP is NTA, but I thought that scenario made as much or more sense than what a lot of people assumed about him taking these steps because of feeling like his relationship with his mother was stolen or something.", "A lot of people use this sub as a way to find people they feel justified in abusing as viciously as they can within the rules of the sub.", "The question was, AITA for being upset?

Now OP doesn't disclose how she reacted to him saying he already bought a gift for his mom, only that he felt the need to reaffirm that his mom is not her mom. Which in my eyes is not fair. When you're married, your mom becomes family(-in-law) to your partner as well. As OP describes it, she is just as much a daughter to her mother-in-law as a full sibling would have been. \n\nAnd seeing your mom getting close to your partner doesn't give you the right to claim them.
