To you, it\u2019s some junk from Amazon. To him, it matters. \n\nPlus side, more presents are better. Why not get your MIL something from you this year as well? Husband gets to show mom he thought of her and have that special connection; you get to pick/make something to honor your special connection, and mom gets two presents. \n\nReal talk: people who don\u2019t know don\u2019t understand how complicated having an estranged mother can be.

It's great you have a good relationship with your MIL but she's ultimately his parent and having an occasional personal gift only from him is incredibly normal. It seems like he may be generally glad that you 2 have a good relationship, but he'd like some recognition that she's his mother, not the mother of both of you.

Maybe get her a card or something smaller that's affordable or you find cute. You're NTA because you have a certain feeling about it. I think YTA if he's brought this up in the past that your relationship with her might be hurting his with her or something. Need more context. \n\nIt sucks and I feel for you though. I don't have a relationship with mine either.", "Definitely NTA. He knew you wanted to get her a gift too, and probably knew how much you care about her.

Perhaps you can make her your own special gift? Even some flowers you pick, go a long way. If she loves you like a mother, she will love anything you give her. Maybe even write her a thoughtful letter. I bet she\u2019d cherish that over any gift. You\u2019re not the Asshole for your feelings - no one but you knows how you feel and your feelings are valid.

I call her mom and we are very close, I care very deeply for her.

I have been talking with my husband about ideas for Mother\u2019s Day for his mom so we could get her something special and he always says he doesn\u2019t know. When I brought it up again, he says, oh I already bought her something. He threw it in my face that it\u2019s his mom and not mine. Am I the asshole for my feelings being hurt?

It especially sounds like that since you got seriously angry about ur husband simply buying a gift for HIS OWN MOM. That's perfectly reasonable for a son to do. and it is a tad reasonable for him to get so protective and territorial of his mom and maybe a bit weirded out that his wife Is acting like his mom is hers.

Sucks that yours sucks, and its awesome you & his mom have such a great relationship -- but you have *zero* reason or right to be upset with him here. No listed previous issues over MIL leads me to conclude the \"it's my mom not yours\" was his direct response to you *being upset he bought his own mother a gift without running it by YOU* rather than his general outlook on your closeness. If so, then you've used it disingenuously here to cast him as petty or jealous instead of correctly answering you why its ok for him to choose & buy her a gift on his own. He's married but he's still a son, so he 100\u2105 gets to pick a gift for his own mother without your input whatsoever. Simply, everything's not about you and he's done nothing here to \"hurt\" you. The fact that you usually choose together & money's tight doesn't change anything. Combined it comes across as justification to insert yourself into Main Character status in a mother-son relationship that doesn't require you, even as it welcomes you. Pot her a flower & bake her a lasagna if money's that tight; or else thank your husband for taking care of it ahead of time and soothe your feathers. \n\nI cannot imagine my spouse being \"hurt\" when I walk in with a Mother's Day gift for my mom. I would assume he was kidding at first, then I'd tell him exactly what yours told you once I realized he was serious.", "NTA\n\nWhat is up with these comments. Yea great that is his mom and not hers technically. But she's been calling her mom for years and are apparently very close. Does the fact that she didn't come out of her vagina mean so much to everyone here. That's her mom too now. Husband and the people commenting here can suck it. \n\nTo address what the husband did. Nothing wrong with buying a gift on his own. But in a marriage communication is key. Why didn't he say something to op all the times she asked him. Or before buying it cos he knows she's been asking about it.

We always hear how marriage is about marrying \u201cinto the family\u201d and essentially merging families, I can see if the husband suddenly pulled the \u201cbut shes MY mom not yours\u201d angle and got her a generic amazon gift without telling OP that OP would be taken aback by that. None of this is a big deal but I really dont like how some YTA comments cant empathize with the fact that you\u2019d be confused why he would do this behind your back.

Now OP doesn't disclose how she reacted to him saying he already bought a gift for his mom, only that he felt the need to reaffirm that his mom is not her mom. Which in my eyes is not fair. When you're married, your mom becomes family(-in-law) to your partner as well. As OP describes it, she is just as much a daughter to her mother-in-law as a full sibling would have been. \n\nAnd seeing your mom getting close to your partner doesn't give you the right to claim them.

There are also budget friendly options: flowers, chocolates, it doesn't have to be an expensive gift! NAH", "NTA. He\u2019s allowed to buy her whatever he wants. She\u2019s allowed to buy her whatever she wants. \nHe said something factual yet hurtful, and she is upset that he bought his own mother something himself. If it was that important, she needed to make it very clear. He\u2019s only also the asshole if he won\u2019t let her put her name on the gift as well.", "INFO: Has he just bought it, or has he GIVEN her it? If the former, can't you just sign it from both of you? If the latter, did he send it from both of you or from just him?\n\nAlso, what has happened the previous 13 years? Did you always end up buying her something because he couldn't decide? Has it always been from both of you?", "There\u2019s too much information missing here to determine NTA or not. \n\nCan I ask though; is there any reason why you\u2019re not being highlighted and celebrated?\nYou say you have a daughter - *you\u2019re* a mom. I\u2019m not trying to downplay or take away from the fact that you have had it rough with your own mom; or from this issue/question. I\u2019ll just state it seems odd that you have to almost replace your mother with your husband\u2019s mother. (That\u2019s what you\u2019re describing here IMO.) You totally can love and have a relationship with her, but I think on this day, it might be more generationally worth your time to celebrate with your daughter. If your husband includes you both, great. But it sounds like your husband is being passive aggressive and feels like he has to compete for his mother\u2019s attention and affection.\nI suggest making new memories, and honor what you do have. And I would hope your husband would be helping your daughter to celebrate you. I\u2019m sorry this is such a rough time OP.\n\nEdit: spelling", "YTA, he bought his mother a gift for mother's day. How is that throwing anything in your face? Are you speaking figuratively or literally? You're reading far too much into this. He is entitled to buy his mother a gift if and when he feels like it. Why would you think after 14 yrs together he would all of a sudden be bothered by your relationship. Your relationship with your own mother has nothing to do with your husband and his mother's relationship.", "This, anyone saying OP is NTA is missing that OP is upset that hubby has a good relationship with his mother that she cant inject herself into.\n\nOP's history sucks, but it doesn't sound at all like she's not being supported and hubby's mom has been good to her. That's not an invitation for OP to wedge herself into their relationship.", "?  When you get married, you are supposed to treat your spouse's parents as your own as you are all family.\n\nThat's true if they were not married and did not have children sure.\n\nBut likely over there is he is expected for support in taking care of his mother for one reason or another.\nMy partner has done things for my parents and I have done things for his parents.  Because we're family, not roommates.\n\nIf the husband had an issue with the relationship, he could have picked a better day than mother's Day.  That feels like weaponizing an issue that his wife didn't know about.  And if he had an issue with it, he should have said something.", "I also look at this from the perspective of, what if this poor guy literally was scrolling on Amazon late at night and got a quick gift to get it out of the way not knowing he was triggering world war 3 \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02! \n\nI do however disagree with your last couple sentences. How would alienating him and being petty solve anything? If he truly does feel like OP is hijacking his mom, I do not think that purposefully making it obvious that he can\u2019t go to a dinner planned with her is going to solve the problem, would escalate it more than anything. That would be the true asshole move in my opinion", "Agreed and I also think she should see a therapist about her mommy issues.", "I don\u2019t think we have enough info to know if it was on purpose though. He might of just saw a gift he liked while scrolling on the web and bought it on a whim. Sounds like he just wasn\u2019t thinking twice more so he purposefully bought a gift quicker than OP for the sole purpose of making sure she had no say in his mother\u2019s gift", "\u201cOur gifts are usually super personal or handmade\u201d. Does he get an actual say in this? Maybe he rather just buy her something and you push for it to be something more special? And maybe that\u2019s why this year he rather do something he wanted?", "I hate to be the one to bring this up but.... if getting Mom the absolute most perfect special gift is so goddamn important why is this conversation happening 3 days before Mother\u2019s Day. \n\nAlso, OP has a daughter.... I have to assume at some point husband has picked out a gift for daughter to give his wife? Do those gifts not count? Why does this have anything to do with who picked out the damn gift???? Why the hell is the gift so important??? Showing people you care doesn\u2019t have to cost any money & it shouldn\u2019t be happening only 1 day of the year!! \n\nI tried to play this scenario out in my head & I can\u2019t think of any other way to respond to anyone who would be critical or upset about me buying a gift for my mother ... um... she\u2019s my mother. Go get your own gift if it\u2019s all about you.\n\nGuaranteed Mom will not care who picked it out the gift. This whole situation is utter nonsense. I could maybe see my 5 yr old twins having this conversation. 2 adults... No", "That\u2019s just a fact.  \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "OP, I\u2019m really sorry about this thread. I feel like a lot of commenters aren\u2019t taking the time to actually understand the core issue here. They think it\u2019s an issue that he bought a present on his own *at all,* not that he changed your over a decade long tradition on a whim and threw that nasty comment in your face. I really hope you don\u2019t take your husband\u2019s comment or many of the comments here to heart, and I hope you\u2019re able to have a happy Mother\u2019s Day despite it all.", "Like op says she talks to her mil more than her husband does. Who\u2019s stopping him from calling her mother more or visiting her? These comments saying she\u2019s stealing his mother are just insane.", "I lost my mother at 17 in a car accident, I recently got married and can't tell you how much I wished she was there \n\nSo trust me when I say I get it. I get wanting to be included and show your appreciation and love to this woman \n\nBut in the kindest possible way, your husband is right, that is his mother and he should be allowed to pick a gift without consulting you.\n\n\nJust imagine if your child ever thought they couldn't buy you a gift without talking to their spouse. They really really want to give you something to show how much you mean but they are put down and criticised for it.", "It's not about the gift. It's about the fact that OP doesn't have a Mother. It's the fact that OP has become close with her MIL in the absence of her own Mother. Which likely elevates the relationship with respect to its position in her world. She attempts to engage her husband in a discussion about what to get her MIL, saying she's excited and looking forward to it. Husband refuses to engage.   \n\n\nI'd be happy if my wife and Mom had such a close relationship after her Moms passing. I'd be more than happy to engage with my partner about her excitement over buying my Mom a Mothers Day gift. I would do everything in power to support and cultivate that relationship knowing how much it did for my wife.  \n\n\nThen husband buys a gift on his own, completely ignoring all the context I just laid out. When OP is understandably hurt given that her own husband doesn't seem to care enough to make the effort to understand why OP was excited or why she was hurt.   \n\n\nWhen OP expresses how his actions hurt her, he then ESSENTIALLY throws it in her face that her mother is dead. \"Don't be mad at me for ignoring your emotions and experiences when it's not my fault that I have a Mom.\" When, clearly, it isn't about the fact the he \"has a Mom' and she doesn't. What an incredibly cruel and thoughtless thing to say. I would feel absolutely ashamed of myself if I said that.  \n\n\nClearly her husband isn't expressing himself properly or communicating his emotions and thoughts honestly. And that's giving him the full brunt of the benefit of the doubt. Sadly, as an adult, it's ones responsibility to check their shit, not there partners responsibility to put up with it.", "Like people have never came to Reddit and give a version of a story that made them look like a saint.", "Have you ever like, genuinely cared for another person or their emotions or their experiences? Like, your logic reads as sociopathic. Do you believe you have carte blanche to say anything to your partner so long as it's a fact? That doesn't bode well for your emotional connections with others in the future.", "Sure, but why does a gift have to break the bank? Go to the dollar store, buy a mason jar, get a sheet of paper, and write out a bunch of happy memories of time spent with MIL, and fill the damn jar with it. It will cost less than $5 and I'm sure she'll love it.  Hell, make a coupon book of experiences for MIL to redeem at a later date, like a walk in the park together, or a home-cooked meal over at theirs. I came up with both of these ideas in less than a minute.", "Have you ever actually lost a parent? Or dated someone who lost a parent? \n\n\nI lost my mum. Nearly lost my dad too. \n\nBut I never tried to control or take over the relationship between my husband and his mother. He doesn't need to consult me to get her a present. He puts my name on the card or I send flowers but at the end of the day it is his mother. \n\nI had mine. She is gone. It sucks. It sucks everyday. It doesn't give me the right to intrude on their relationship", "Given that the second half of her comment is *but wouldn\u2019t it be better if we picked something out together*, overall that reads to me he was never super gung-ho about this but she probably guilt tripped (whether intentionally or unintentionally) him into letting her weigh in on his present to his mom the past decade.", "I don't disagree, but that is not what this post is about. \n\nIt is about OP feeling the TA for feeling hurt because her husband blindsided her and communicated like a spoilt bratty child rather than a grown man and husband. \n\nI would suggest DMing your gift idea to the OP though, as I think she should make something this year. Not only will a thoughtful gift like that mean a lot, but it will probably also upstage the husband's gift lol! \n\nCan't help but wonder if maybe the husband has actually gotten like a spa treatment for wife and mom as a gift or something and that is why he is being cagey and weird all of a sudden?...", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. I\u2019ve also nearly lost my dad, and my mom\u2019s health is poor so I\u2019ve been in fear of losing her for years. And that\u2019s the relationship that works for you and MIL. There isn\u2019t anything wrong with that. But you\u2019re presuming that OP is \u201ctaking over\u201d the relationship when that isn\u2019t what happened. OP has said in comments that her husband encouraged them to be close and told OP that his mom is her mom too. MIL loves OP as a daughter and treats her as such. OP loves her MIL. MIL is capable of loving her son and daughter-in-law and having a relationship with the both of them, which they\u2019ve done for eleven years.\n\nThis is a tradition they\u2019ve done for eleven years. There is *nothing wrong* with Husband wanting to get a gift just from him, he just needed to communicate that. Instead he changed that tradition and then made that \u201cshe\u2019s my mom, not yours\u201d comment to OP when that contradicts everything he\u2019s said and done in the past.\n\nOP hasn\u2019t been intruding. She was *invited.* It\u2019s not good to explicitly invite someone into your family and then treat them as lesser than.", "I agree with that I feel as if he feels some pressure from her and is doing this because he wants some independence. He\u2019s allowed to do what he wants to do", "Considering that they both want to get her something and OP\u2019s mention of a tight budget, I think it\u2019s reasonable for them to pick out one item together. If there were never any other hints, it just seems like he lashed out about it. If they\u2019re a reasonable couple, he could have talked to her about how he felt. I wonder if she now feels she can\u2019t even add her name to the gift and can\u2019t afford another gift to put her name on. I know it would make me feel guilty that I had nothing nice to give her.\n\nETA: I don\u2019t think she\u2019s wrong for feeling excluded. And I think maybe the husband has a reasonable answer for him wanting a gift from only him/picked out by him. I just think he could have explained instead of reacting how he did.", "I honestly agree. He might also be exhausted at OP\u2019s seemingly constant need to try and use his mom to help cope with her own childhood trauma. He just wants his mom to himself for this one time which I don\u2019t think is necessarily abnormal. Its a big job of emotional labor to have OP rely on his mom for therapy and fatigue for him is going to be natural. Whether it\u2019s subconscious or not he definitely meant SOMETHING with his comment", "How? No where in the post does it say that he told her she can\u2019t take some construction paper and make her a card that says I love you", "I feel like there's a whole lot of context missing from that. I doubt hubby escalated from OP saying \"I'd like to be involved in buying your mom a present\" to him immediately throwing it in her face.", "Oh come on. Given the history, you know that was an antagonistic and emotionally charged comment. \u201cShe\u2019s my mom, not yours\u201d when he knows OP\u2019s biomom is abusive, when he knows this day is difficult for her, when he knows OP has had a mother/daughter relationship with his mom for over eleven years, when he has actively encouraged their relationship in the past so this reaction comes out of left field, when he knows he and OP have had the tradition of getting the gift together.\n\nSometimes stating a \u201cfact\u201d can be hurtful if done maliciously, as it seems this was. And this can\u2019t even be classified as a fact because they do have a mother/daughter relationship and the husband has *told OP* that his mom is *her mom too* in the past.", "You\u2019re taking it that way due to the OP not being descriptive, I do believe in gender roles im not sexist I just know I\u2019m an emotional being compared to the men I know like my brother and my boyfriend I\u2019m sorry that upsets you"]}
