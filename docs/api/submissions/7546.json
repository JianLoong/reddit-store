And on the night before I left, my father, took me out to dinner. I had kinda been expecting that he would pull this stunt of isolating me from everyone else to start interrogating me. So no surprise but I was still bracing myself for the bombardment of questions. \n\nOnly that wasn't what happened. We didn't even get out of the neighborhood before he starts talking about on how difficult the following conversation was going to be. Begins by saying that he knows he was a horrible father and that he didn't want to be like his dad and make excuses for it. Goes on about on how I ended up getting the brunt of the shitty dad (I am the baby of a big family). He was doing great in the sense of being financially secure and achieving more academically than was ever expected. But he was miserable and took it out on the family. Mostly just being nitpicky and just tearing anyone down that caught his eye. There was some other stuff but you get the idea.\n\nPoint being he admitted all of this and said he was sorry and that he wants to be apart of my life now. It's been almost a whole month and I still can't even begin to picture ever forgiving him. Literal years have gone by where I only saw him maybe 3-4 times a year. For good reason being as being around him tends to end in either a \"You should be doing more/better\" or \"You won't be able to get far in life without taking my advice\"\n\nThe reason why I'm posting this here is that my mom and sister have been texting me about it being a good thing. Personally just felt like a bomb went off and now I'm trying to pick up the pieces. It also felt very sudden, no warning just bam heavily charged emotional rant (I didn't really say much, just tried to keep my cool). \n\nAnyways, I think he was actually being genuine about the apology but it seems like a cheap Band-Aid being slapped on a gaping wound. I had started therapy last year, and I was doing good. I was healing from events from childhood that stemmed from him. But since December, it's like he tore the stitches out and tried to pour alcohol on it so \"it wouldn't fester\". That's what my mother and sister think I'm doing, that I'm holding a grudge. \n\nIt doesn't seem like enough, but I don't think that anything he says or does will ever be enough. Spent 18 years under his roof and dictatorship, spending money and time right now to fix the issues that he caused. One \"I'm sorry\" isn't enough or maybe I'm asking for too much.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673938759, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10e5lsu/aita_for_not_forgiving_my_father/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Well although it's better that he apologized it still doesn't fix anything. What happened happened. Actions have consequences, regretting them does not negate these.", "NTA\n\nAn apology does not mean that you have to forgive the person immediately - or ever.\n\nIt sounds like you are working on your trauma from growing up.  Processing his \"confession of guilt\" has set you back some, but you'll work your way through it and be stronger.\n\nTell your mom and sister to butt out.  You need to deal with this on YOUR emotional timetable, not your family's.\n\nIt's ok if you are never able to forgive your father.  Only you can make that decision.\n\nHugs and Good Luck", "I think this is way above this sub-Reddit's pay grade. You have 100% valid reasons to not forgive in this matter. You also have therapy planned. Start there as that will help you weigh up things better. A road starts with the first paving stone being laid. Maybe take this situation as the first paving stone?", " NTA. You\u2019re allowed to come to a place where you accept someone\u2019s apology in your own time. You can sit with what they said as their apology for as long as you need to. They offer the apology - but it still has to be accepted. You may decide not to accept it, ever. That\u2019s your choice and those are your consequences.   \n\nYou can feel whatever you want, however you want to, for as long as you want to, about this situation. These are your emotions, and your thoughts, and your feelings. Not anyone else\u2019s. Apologising to someone does not mean an automatic acceptance on their part. You do not have to swallow hurt feelings because someone apologised. You can still hurt and it\u2019s OK to say, I\u2019m not forgiving you at the moment.", "You are NTA and you don't owe anyone forgiveness, especially after literal decades of torment capped off by one blindside apology. And tell your mother and sister to back off- it's none of their business if or when you ever forgive him. Keep going to therapy, OP, and I hope you continue to find some healing for yourself.", "NTA. Trust is built slowly but lost quickly. 18yrs of losing trust out ways giving trust quickly. Your choice - you can accept the apology and also not give trust.", "NTA\n\n> The reason why I'm posting this here is that my mom and sister have been texting me about it being a good thing.\n\nIt's good in the sense he's trying to grow from his mistakes, but being sorry for the damage he inflicted doesn't make it go away. You have no obligation to forgive him: forgiveness is for the abused, not the abuser, and it is never owed.", "NTA - I don't like the whole concept of forgiveness because, in reality, they can't take back all the hurt you've experienced and no matter what you won't forget what or who caused it.\n\nHowever, you can try and give them another chance Only time will tell whether or not they are being sincere and actually try to make up for their past mistakes.\n\nOfcourse that's only if you're willing to let them and there's always the risk of getting hurt again.", "NTA. Your mother and sister need to understand that there\u2019s no timeline for forgiveness. If it\u2019s forced, it just isn\u2019t going to work.  It\u2019s great that your dad opened up to you and acknowledged his faults as a father, but it doesn\u2019t mean that the trauma of your past didn\u2019t happen.  For them to say it\u2019s a \u201cgrudge\u201d shows how much they are downplaying it all.  You don\u2019t have to do anything - if at all - until you\u2019re ready. And it isn\u2019t going to happen overnight. Unfortunately, families have a way of glossing over uncomfortable situations. Perhaps your therapist can help you figure out how to manage your mom and sister.  You are not obligated to mend your relationship with him for anyone else. If you chose to go down that road, do it because you want to and are ready.", "NTA People can apologize, you don\u2019t have to accept their apology. \n\nI had a pretty absent father growing up and my Dad made some big mistakes. He has apologized and I told him what I needed moving forward. I needed to see change, and I needed us to build a future relationship where there was a significant effort on his part. We are pretty good now.\n\nCut to my Mom. I grew up living with her and I went through a lot with her. She has said a cop out sorry like your Dad. I\u2019m 34 now, and I\u2019ve told her I can\u2019t go on pretending like it\u2019s enough. It\u2019s therapy together to hash it out and talk about the truth so we can have any hope of a relationship that is something real, or I can\u2019t do it anymore. It\u2019s that pr we go no contact. I told her I\u2019ll give her time since I can tell she\u2019s not ready yet, but I won\u2019t wait forever. I gave her a timeline of a year to start therapy together. She has to commit or I\u2019m done. \n\nI don\u2019t have the answer for you, but I\u2019m here to tell you your feelings are valid and you don\u2019t owe forgiveness to a single apology for a lifetime of hurt.", "NTA\n\n\nIt's progress that he's admitted his failings, but that doesn't mean you have to forgive him. \n\n\nYou decide if and when he's forgiven. Only you. Tell your family to make their own decisions and leave you to make yours.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He was very distant and he would go out most nights. He wasn't very nice to my mum and would constantly shout at us. He never hit us though. He was very strict with us and I hated him for it.\n\nWe lived in a rough area and the friends I had growing up went into drugs and burglary whereas I didn't. \n\nWhen I was older I found out a lot about his childhood. He was pretty much beaten daily by his parents and he didn't go to school. He didn't achieve much and he didn't want that for us. He had never been shown how to be a parent and it just didn't come as naturally to him and he did what he could to keep us on the straight and narrow. \n\nWhen I got older he mellowed out, probably because his work was done and he could see that we were all doing well for ourselves. I thought that I could either be pissed off with him for being how he was or just accept that it was his way of caring and just enjoy being friends with my dad.

Drawing from my own CA experience and the stories of many others, I believe this situation is extremely rare.
