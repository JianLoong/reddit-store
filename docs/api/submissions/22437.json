So I just don't tell people very often.\n\nI met Daniel (32M) and eventually told him about my autism. He was really supportive. One of the things I do is dance (terribly) to get out energy from the day. \n\nBut my dancing is bad, private, and not something I do around a lot of people. It's one of the few socially acceptable stims I have ever been able to do, because I did dance as a kid and no one teased me for it.\n\nDaniel has ADHD and we met through a support group/meet up in our area. We have been involved romantically for 6 months, friends for about a year before that.\n\nI found out that Daniel has been taking videos of my dancing and sharing with his sister + Mom. He thinks it is adorable, but I am horrified. He showed me the chats. He was not making fun of me. His sister was not rude about it.\n\nBut his mother called it \"hippie dancing\" and asked if I smoked weed. (I do) She seemed to think it was weird I dance during the day when no one else is around.\n\nWe got into a screaming match about the videos and I had a panic attack. I ended up unable to function for most of the day and my best friend came over to help me. \n\nDaniel tried to get me to talk to him, but I was so upset that I just kept pushing him away when he tried to hug me. He eventually packed a bag and left for his friend's house.\n\nIt took me most of the day to calm down. My best friend thinks he was an asshole for it. \n\nI think the relationship is so damaged I don't know if I trust him. I danced around him because I thought he understood it was my way of being happy but I didn't want it shared with others.\n\nMy mother thinks I am taking it personally and that he was doing something my Dad did a lot with her (taking cute candid.) My dad, who is also on the spectrum, said that Mom was okay with it. He said he would never have done it if she said no. She liked the candid pictures.\n\nHe has tried to text, but I always say \"I am not ready to talk now.\"\n\nHe sent me an apology text and said I could send whatever video to my parents if I wanted. I said that is not the point and if he can't get it why are we dating?\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1689534879, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151er4h/aita_my_boyfriend_sent_a_picture_of_me_dancing_in/", "score": 101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Consent is not a new concept. This is so far out of bounds.

While his impulsivity likely played a part, it doesn\u2019t make you an asshole.

He should have gotten your permission before sharing the photos.\n\nThat being said, I do think you might be over reacting a bit. It seems there was no ill will and no one took it poorly.

It not only has broken your trust in him but it turned something that was private into a show. It made you feel shamed for something that brings you happiness and that is not okay. Your feelings are valid and you have the right to be upset with him for doing something upsetting. I would wait until you have had some time to process and think about things. Once you have I suggest you have a very open talk to him about how this made you feel and why. When you do have this talk discuss boundaries with him and if he can't respect those boundaries then that is on him. You will have done all you could.", "NTA.

If you feel upset and violated take the time to deal with it.\n\nConsider if he knew this was a private thing you wanted to keep to yourself.

Aside from from pretty universally accepted \u201cdon\u2019t take videos of me in the bathroom and send them to grandma\u201d rules it\u2019s a good idea to clarify what stays between us and what\u2019s out for public consumption.\n\nIt seems like there was a massive communication breakdown here, you said the comments were not malicious so it seems like he made a genuine mistake.  Is it worth throwing everything away?  That\u2019s up to you.  Does he have a habit of disregarding your feelings?  Is this the first strike or the 10th?  Does he deserve some grace because he misjudged a situation and you know he would never intentionally hurt you?  Is he an inherently cruel person or did he make a colossal mistake as us humans do?\n\nI agree with you that sending a \u201crevenge\u201d video of him to your parents isn\u2019t the point, but it does sound like he is contrite and is trying to find a way to apologize beyond just saying \u201csorry.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll have to make your peace with this in your timeline, you\u2019re wise to tell him you\u2019re not ready to talk now when you\u2019re not.

We have always called it imagination play; he plays out scenarios in his head or re-enacts his day\u2026 (He also stims with his fringe or tapping his legs).

He already finds it embarrassing if others hear him doing it.", ">Daniel knew it was a stimming activity and that it was private.\n\nThis is all I needed to read.\n\nYou made a boundary clear. He chose to put his own needs over yours and violated your boundary. You trusted him to show your true self and your form of stimming and he shared it without your consent.\n\nThat is hurtful and disrespectful. I am sorry that he hurt you like this. This is NOT an over-reaction. We are always telling people to have boundaries and get out of relationships when a partner tramples over their boundaries. Same applies here. \n\nI'm sorry that your mom doesn't get it either. You deserve better than what happened. I hope you feel safe now. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You have the right to get upset about it.

I thought that was just common courtesy. I might be going too far in my desire not to cause offense. \n\nMaybe talk sincerely with him, before you toss him over the side?

NAH, and best of luck.", "[deleted]", "INFO: Did Daniel know that this was a boundary of yours prior to recording and sharing?\n\nTo clarify, that is something that he should have kept private and requested your permission to share, but I do think that your reaction may not be justified if a hard boundary hadn't been set.

All the kids who would flip each other off when the teacher wasn't looking to get you to react and get in trouble all year?\n\nThat doesn't change as everyone becomes adults, people find more clever ways to do shit like that.

Always going to be something.", "You thought \"he understood it was your way of being happy but I didn't want it shared with others\". Why?

He is also ND. I was so embarrassed at first. Until I realized that just like your boyfriend, he did it because he thinks I'm adorable. I even found out he listens/watches the videos when he's having a difficult day. \n\nI understand why you got upset, but please remember this was out of love. You are adored. Consider it might be some internalized ableism causing you to feel so upset. From his perspective, you're simply a beautiful human that brings him joy.\n\nETA: None of what I said above is meant to mean that what he did is okay. It's obviously not, and he made a stupid mistake. But it doesn't mean there isn't more going on that should be explored, even single.", "See like I want to agree with you but I\u2019m going with an ESH, the glaring issue to me is that you both supposedly have cognitive functioning issues ie autism and adhd yet you haven\u2019t acknowledged that his own diagnosis is also wrapped up in all this too. He\u2019s probably impulsive and doesn\u2019t think much before doing things which normally I would fault someone but not really in this scenario. If you\u2019re both seeking out meet ups and support groups I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s not neurotypical either seems kind of wrong to immediately go to a defcon 10 response.", "NAH\n\nThere\u2019s a couple things going on here. \n\nHe shouldn\u2019t have taken or shared those videos, but he didn\u2019t do it maliciously, and he is trying to make amends. \nYou are overreacting by most standards, but your reaction is due to a rather unique and understandable set of factors.\n\nAll these things are true at the same time. If you\u2019re asking for permission for this to be a deal breaker for you because you can\u2019t see yourself trusting him again, you have it. If you\u2019re asking for permission to forgive him and move forward, you have that, too.", "Perhaps you both can go to couple counseling to sort it out? I feel that he\u2019s in the wrong, but his intention is not malicious. He sounded like he wanted to share his joy with his family. Unfortunately, he shouldn\u2019t overstep your boundary in order to do that.\n\nMost important is how both of you move on from here and know that boundaries cannot be stomped on. If you two can\u2019t, then it\u2019s time to break off.", "YTA you don't get to start screaming at someone just because you're upset.", "NAH. He doesn\u2019t sound like he had ill intent and it makes sense that you are bothered because your privacy was intruded upon. I think it definitely could have been a conversation instead of a blow up, but at the nothing was done to hurt the other and there was no reason to put a dent in the relationship.", "LOL instead of telling him you weren\u2019t happy and talking to him like a person you just started screaming at him? Just for that YTA I mean what kind of adult acts like that?", "INFO\n\nDid he know it was a private thing you were willing to share with him, but not the world?", "It really depends on if he knew that you wouldn\u2019t want him to do that. If he did know, then NTA and you would be right to react however you want to. If he didn\u2019t know, then YTA for over reacting and should accept his apology while making sure that he knows that is not ok in the future.

It would be one thing if he just thought it was cute and was taking them for himself and never showing it to anyone. That would still be kind of weird anyway but sharing them just makes this feel extra icky. I really don't know how to rule here because he was definitely in the wrong regardless of if his intentions were pure. And I can understand her knee-jerk reaction of yelling at him in the moment. But this is been dragging out for a week and she's giving him the silent treatment. This needs to be resolved one way or the other. If she doesn't feel safe around him anymore then she really has no choice but to break up with him. IMO she is justified to feel the way she does, but it's time to have a talk with him and either break up with him or move past it. It isn't right to drag this out any longer.", "I thought it was two close family members? Where did he put it online??? That changes things for sure.", "That is kind of the thing that I am feeling. It might not be something other people feel is wrong... but stimming is so intimate. My mother wanted my brother and me to be liked, well behaved, and successful. I am thankful she got us help but the masking is exhausting and fairy dancing helps me feel more in control of myself.\n\nThe fact that he not only taped it, but showed people... horrifying. I have weird stims that I do when alone and thinking about sharing a home with someone who would show them to other people... Makes me itch. \n\nI can't do that.", "He showed people I don't know well enough to stim in front of MY stimming, a private moment that I trusted him with. You don't get to show \"the joy\" I bring you when it is traumatizing for me.", "Because most autistic people have been punished, mocked, and bullied severely for stimming to the point that they learn to mask as a trauma response.  It's not because she was dancing, it's because she was stimming.\n\nif you needed to do a thing (stim) to regulate your nervous system and you were punished and mocked for it, to the point where you only did it it private, and forced yourself to not do it in public even when you needed to you would see the difference.  This is not a metaphor.", "it doesn't \"show\" autism, op was stimming which is a trait of autism, and many autistic people (myself included) don't like showing their stims to people they don't trust. \n\nmany autistic people get mocked and made fun of, and seeing said stimming can give bullies a weapon to use against autistic people. Im not saying the bfs mom and sister are bullies, its just a reason why many don't like it\n\nanother reason is that its a very personal thing, as it lets autistic unmask and and relax. I'd compare it to singing to yourself while you're in the shower, or if youre dancing around like no ones watching. its something that many neurotypical people do, and they find it embarrassing when caught. that's how many autistic people feel while theyre stimming.\n\nnote: everyone does stim, autistic and other neurodivergent people just do it more than our neurotypical counterparts", "thats still a shitty and kinda gross generalization of autistic people. autistic people aren't \"super geniuses\", theyre just people.", "People generally don't need to be explicitly instructed to not take and share embarrassing pictures of someone.", "Again, unmasked as i was raised to mask it. The deeper issues really lies with your up bringing and how you were taught to show/pretend you were not autistic.", "I have told him.", "This is perfect", "Yes op did comment it elsewhere", "No comment on your judgement, but autism and other neurodivergent diagnoses are not by definition mental illness. Typically those of us with mental illness (like my CPTSD) see the illness as something to be managed through therapy, medication, etc. Neurodivergence tends to be a social term that describes someone with certain neurological characteristics that may or may not require psychological/behavioral management.", "I don't trust anything sent through FB is not gonna somehow end up online at some point.", "I don\u2019t blame you. I saw you commented on other folks asking for info that you\u2019ve told him before that it\u2019s private. I don\u2019t get how he thought \u201cprivate\u201d meant \u201crecord me and share it with your family\u201d.", "The masking is exhausting, so why mask?", "I completely agree with you. It was a stupid mistake and he obviously shouldn't have done it. But you're carrying this out far beyond what's reasonable. Either break up with him, or be willing to understand the \"why\" to his mistake so that you can find forgiveness.", "That wasnt what i askd.", "Right, \"generally\". OP's boyfriend is also neurodivergent.", "Then you're definitely not the ah. Also not sure why you all downvote questions. It's necessary info imo\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "That's... Pretty paranoid. \n\nLook, it sounds like you've made up your mind. He made a dumb mistake, and you responded in kind. You're not an asshole for that. But having your mind made up about the future of the relationship and making him wait and grovel for a week, and still going strong, when you have already decided you're done with him does make you an asshole.", "Because if we don't most people won't interact with us. Which is kind of important to have a job, or go shopping. I don't remain friends with people who need the mask though, or who break the trust that letting the mask down entails.", "You asked how dancing, which is this person's stimming (self soothing) behaviour is revealing that their autistic. Stimming while shared with some other neurological deviations is mostly attributed to autism. For someone who stims it feels incredibly, hyper, obvious to other people and honestly, it often is easily recognizable as something strange to outsiders, due to the behaviours looping nature. While an outsider might not specifically identify autism they do identify the strange behaviour and the person not being normal, which is what this person was trying to avoid.\n\nGenerally, non neurodivergent people get very frustrated or annoyed at stimming and reactions range from demands to stop fidgeting to throwing you down hall and kicking in your ribs because you're being annoying on purpose. If somone is dealing with the trauma from those kinds of situations just being identified as unusual is going to feel very threatening, and if it was shared by somone you trust would feel like a massive betrayel even though there may not be a negative reaction. \n\nAlthough aside from all that there is probably a much more practical reason, the boyfriend showed them the conversations, there is a good chance he mentioned they were autistic.", "NTA. As a person with ADHD, we often do things impulsively, without thinking about the consequences. HOWEVER, something I\u2019ve worked hard on myself personally, is recognizing when I\u2019ve done something wrong or hurtful to another person, and sincerely apologizing and making up to them. It seems that at first BF had no ill will, the fact that he cannot recognize what he did wrong, nor does he understand that he broke your trust, is what\u2019s important.\n\nI\u2019d just like to add one more thing. When I was younger, and I\u2019m sure even now, my parents would tell me I saw the world very black-and-white. The idea of I did something wrong, let me take the literal thing I did wrong and let the other person do it to me was a very common response for me. And, if it were me, even now I might need something spelled out explicitly to understand. I get caught up in the literal, actual thing that I don\u2019t even think about the implications and what it MEANS to the other person. If you feel like you are able, I would have a serious talk about this with him and tell him exactly what\u2019s going on in your head, about how it was more about the breach of trust (if I understood correctly) than the specific circumstance of recording you dancing. But please, I\u2019m just a stranger on the internet. You do what you feel the most comfortable doing.", "NTA- He violated your privacy and we made you a joke to his family.\n\nHe did not have your consent.", "You could not have handled this any better.   I'm sorry you are going through this.", "I'm not autistic, though I do have ADHD, but I don't stim. Even so, if someone surreptitiously recorded me doing *anything* personal and private and shared it with anyone else, I doubt I could ever trust that person again.\n\nNTA, and I hope OP dumps the AH.", "I think that's reasonable.  You're entitled to privacy.", "Fuck, I have a \"waiting for the kettle to boil\" dance that's probably an adhd thing and I would be mortified if someone videoed my dumb ass to share it without my knowledge, no matter the intentions. Like, if you find it cute, great, tell *me* not the world.", "He videoed without her knowledge or consent and shared it, she didn't tell him no because she had no idea he was doing it. Ffs, no-one should have to tell their SO not to take and share videos of them, the SO should be asking permission.", "This is a great comment."]}
