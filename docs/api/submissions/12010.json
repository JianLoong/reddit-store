I\u2019m going to call him Richard Head.\n\nRichard thinks I\u2019m a screw up because I got Jack\u2019s deadbeat mom pregnant when we were in high school, and I think he\u2019s a hypocrite because his son is 30 years older than his daughter so I\u2019m pretty sure she wasn\u2019t planned either. He also has that old school thing where he thinks little girls should be princesses and little boys should be toughened up. I think toughening up a 3-year-old sounds cruel. He thinks boys need more than time out. I\u2019ll leave it there. He\u2019s also seems to think I should just mean to Jack. One time we were waiting to sign our kids out and he told me I was making my kid a wuss because I stopped tickling him when he told me to and I should make him try to fight back or something. Uh, he's 3? I\u2019m 5 times his size, dude. What\u2019s he supposed to do fend me off? I\u2019m trying to play with him, not teach him to survive in the wild against a pack of tickle wolves. He thinks I spoil him because I pick him up when he wants me to. I think the only way to spoil a kid is buying them everything and letting them get away with things they shouldn\u2019t. Its not like Jack acts out all the time, he\u2019s just really affectionate. I think it\u2019s cute.\n\nHere's where I might be the asshole: yesterday when I was walking into the school to pick Jack up, Richard decided to start giving me crap again about how my son is spoiled and I need to stop coddling him. My son wasn\u2019t even there, so I\u2019m not sure what I was doing this time to piss him off. I usually just ignore him, but Jack\u2019s mother pulled some bs the other day, so I was already in a protective mood. Richard is always complaining that his son never answers his texts, so when he started with me, I told Richard that I don\u2019t need the opinion of someone whose son doesn\u2019t even want to talk to him. He told me to go f--- myself and that I should learn to keep it in my pants. I told him that if he can\u2019t handle that his son doesn\u2019t like him, maybe he should either stop being a jackass or toughen up. He told me that my son should\u2019ve been in a condom. I told him that he should\u2019ve gotten a vasectomy 30 years ago.\n\nSomeone's mom stepped in, and Richard stomped into the bathroom. She said that I was overreacting. I said te treats his daughter like she\u2019s the queen of England, but thinks my son is spoiled because I hug him and don\u2019t give him outdated punishments. She said that it was generational, and that I can\u2019t blame an old dude for thinking that. I said that I\u2019m tired of him giving me unsolicited bad advice. She said that I\u2019m going to have to get over it, because I\u2019m a teenager and people are going to do that. That I\u2019m acting like an angry kid and not a parent.
