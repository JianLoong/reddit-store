I\u2019m going to call him Richard Head.\n\nRichard thinks I\u2019m a screw up because I got Jack\u2019s deadbeat mom pregnant when we were in high school, and I think he\u2019s a hypocrite because his son is 30 years older than his daughter so I\u2019m pretty sure she wasn\u2019t planned either. He also has that old school thing where he thinks little girls should be princesses and little boys should be toughened up. I think toughening up a 3-year-old sounds cruel. He thinks boys need more than time out. I\u2019ll leave it there. He\u2019s also seems to think I should just mean to Jack. One time we were waiting to sign our kids out and he told me I was making my kid a wuss because I stopped tickling him when he told me to and I should make him try to fight back or something. Uh, he's 3? I\u2019m 5 times his size, dude. What\u2019s he supposed to do fend me off? I\u2019m trying to play with him, not teach him to survive in the wild against a pack of tickle wolves. He thinks I spoil him because I pick him up when he wants me to. I think the only way to spoil a kid is buying them everything and letting them get away with things they shouldn\u2019t. Its not like Jack acts out all the time, he\u2019s just really affectionate. I think it\u2019s cute.\n\nHere's where I might be the asshole: yesterday when I was walking into the school to pick Jack up, Richard decided to start giving me crap again about how my son is spoiled and I need to stop coddling him. My son wasn\u2019t even there, so I\u2019m not sure what I was doing this time to piss him off. I usually just ignore him, but Jack\u2019s mother pulled some bs the other day, so I was already in a protective mood. Richard is always complaining that his son never answers his texts, so when he started with me, I told Richard that I don\u2019t need the opinion of someone whose son doesn\u2019t even want to talk to him. He told me to go f--- myself and that I should learn to keep it in my pants. I told him that if he can\u2019t handle that his son doesn\u2019t like him, maybe he should either stop being a jackass or toughen up. He told me that my son should\u2019ve been in a condom. I told him that he should\u2019ve gotten a vasectomy 30 years ago.\n\nSomeone's mom stepped in, and Richard stomped into the bathroom. She said that I was overreacting. I said te treats his daughter like she\u2019s the queen of England, but thinks my son is spoiled because I hug him and don\u2019t give him outdated punishments. She said that it was generational, and that I can\u2019t blame an old dude for thinking that. I said that I\u2019m tired of him giving me unsolicited bad advice. She said that I\u2019m going to have to get over it, because I\u2019m a teenager and people are going to do that. That I\u2019m acting like an angry kid and not a parent.

My own kid laid down the law on kisses at a very young age and I respected that.  As a result I still get hugs and cuddles now that they are older.  It\u2019s so important to respect boundaries and teach them that you respect theirs so they can learn bodily autonomy.", "NTA. I'm 36 and my children were planned, and I'd say you're NTA and doing an amazing job. I know a few people who became parents before they were ready and I've used them as role models in my parenting because they put more thought into how to raise their children than many people who followed the \"typical\" path of becoming a family. \n\nIgnore that dude, though. He sounds like he's looking for an excuse to start a fight, and you don't need that.", "You sound like a good dad!!!", "NTA- This nosy madam needs to learn to button it, you are absolutely not obliged to put up with random strangers' unsolicited and backwards advice just because you are younger than them. Your life is none of their business. You sound incredibly mature, responsible and kind, and like a lovely example of masculinity. You had me at 'tickle wolves', that's such a 'my dad' thing to say and he's awesome. He was 30 when I was born and he had the exact same attitude as you. You and he have a 'parenting gene' that I failed entirely to inherit and I look at it like I look at people who can multiply 5 digit numbers in their heads: impressive!", "NTA! You can defend yourself no matter what age you are! You also should protect your son from assholes like Richard! That woman was incorrect as I\u2019m sure you know. You do NOT have to get used to people trying to tell you how to raise your son. You didn\u2019t ask him for advice. He shouldn\u2019t have given it!", "NTA - It\u2019s not generational, being an ass is still being an ass. Richard needs to mind his own business.", "NTA, fuck that guy.", "NTA. you sound like a better parent than many people far older than you. Your son is lucky to have a loving and affectionate parent. You really can\u2019t overstate how valuable it is to have a parent who loves you and actually wants to spend time with you. I know this post has a million comments but I really hope you see this and know how good you\u2019re doing. Screw the angry old guy, you\u2019re killing it", ">Should I have kept my mouth shut? AITA?\n\nHell no!!! Hell NO!\n\nOne thing is offering some advice (even if unsolicited) in a nice manner, a couple of times. Now when the advice comes too often and it's more like someone criticizing you: hell no don't shut up! \n\nThat dude needs to look at his life instead of bothering with your life. I'd be talking back to him ANYTIME! Everyone else saying that you overreacted (as in, you didn't \"keep the peace\") because the guy is from a different generation is just enabling him. You protect yourself and your kid, this guy can go take a hike.\n\nSo N T A", "NTA\n\n>She said that it was generational, and that I can\u2019t blame an old dude for thinking that.\n\nMan learned how to use a cell phone at some point I presume.

Nta", "I will never understand the generational argument.\n\nOur society has moved on and shown that what previous generations believed was wrong, and we have since changed. That is how it works.\n\nYou don't get to say 'Well, I was around before this current stuff, therefor I don't have to change.' Cause yeah, you do. We collectively agreed what you did and believed was wrong.\n\nOtherwise, we just give all these awful people a pass because things used to be different, and we may as well not changed a fucking thing. \n\nIf things were good before, they wouldn't have changed.", "If anything, i bet the chimpanzee can act more civilized than an aggressive unhinged richard if hes trained :))", "My kids are OP\u2019s age. This might have been generational from my grandparents, but my parents and I side with OP\u2019s style of parenting. I call BS. OP was right. Did he go nuclear on him? Yes. He wasn\u2019t reacting to a single dig, he was reacting to ongoing harassment. NTA.", "If anyone was acting like an angry kid was the old dude, who is probably used to just dishing out and not taking it. Because ooohh \"generationaaaall\"! That doesn't excuse disrespect, some older people think that it's ok but then backtrack once they taste some of that and get all butt hurt!\n\nI bet that after this that guy will not even speak to OP directly, will mutter under his breath or something", "Apparently being an adult is allowing someone to insult and berate you just because they are older", "[removed]", "Nah. Ask him why his son declines to speak to him. Bet it's because of his parenting choices.", "Exactly this. What a mature, kind parenting approach from OP! OP, you are raising a son who will know what respecting boundaries looks like and only knows love and kindness from his dad. Good on you! NTA, and ole Richard Head (giggle) needs to fuck right off to fuck-off ville. His parenting style made his son not talk to him. Why would you ever take any advice from him except to do the exact opposite? (which you already are! keep up the great parenting job!)", "Forgot to say.  Keep loving your kid and respecting his boundaries.   You're a good dad", "He wanted a punching bag and folded the instant the bag punched back.\n\n[Needs to harden the fuck up.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unkIVvjZc9Y)", "I caught that too.
