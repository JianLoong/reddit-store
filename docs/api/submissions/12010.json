Everyone gets unsolicited parenting advice I know, but I\u2019m sure you can imagine that people get pretty rude about it because of my age. You get used to it.\n\nThere\u2019s this one guy at Jack\u2019s preschool who still gets under my skin though. I\u2019m going to call him Richard Head.\n\nRichard thinks I\u2019m a screw up because I got Jack\u2019s deadbeat mom pregnant when we were in high school, and I think he\u2019s a hypocrite because his son is 30 years older than his daughter so I\u2019m pretty sure she wasn\u2019t planned either. He also has that old school thing where he thinks little girls should be princesses and little boys should be toughened up. I think toughening up a 3-year-old sounds cruel. He thinks boys need more than time out. I\u2019ll leave it there. He\u2019s also seems to think I should just mean to Jack. One time we were waiting to sign our kids out and he told me I was making my kid a wuss because I stopped tickling him when he told me to and I should make him try to fight back or something. Uh, he's 3? I\u2019m 5 times his size, dude. What\u2019s he supposed to do fend me off? I\u2019m trying to play with him, not teach him to survive in the wild against a pack of tickle wolves. He thinks I spoil him because I pick him up when he wants me to. I think the only way to spoil a kid is buying them everything and letting them get away with things they shouldn\u2019t. Its not like Jack acts out all the time, he\u2019s just really affectionate. I think it\u2019s cute.\n\nHere's where I might be the asshole: yesterday when I was walking into the school to pick Jack up, Richard decided to start giving me crap again about how my son is spoiled and I need to stop coddling him. My son wasn\u2019t even there, so I\u2019m not sure what I was doing this time to piss him off. I usually just ignore him, but Jack\u2019s mother pulled some bs the other day, so I was already in a protective mood. Richard is always complaining that his son never answers his texts, so when he started with me, I told Richard that I don\u2019t need the opinion of someone whose son doesn\u2019t even want to talk to him. He told me to go f--- myself and that I should learn to keep it in my pants. I told him that if he can\u2019t handle that his son doesn\u2019t like him, maybe he should either stop being a jackass or toughen up. He told me that my son should\u2019ve been in a condom. I told him that he should\u2019ve gotten a vasectomy 30 years ago.\n\nSomeone's mom stepped in, and Richard stomped into the bathroom. She said that I was overreacting. I said te treats his daughter like she\u2019s the queen of England, but thinks my son is spoiled because I hug him and don\u2019t give him outdated punishments. She said that it was generational, and that I can\u2019t blame an old dude for thinking that. I said that I\u2019m tired of him giving me unsolicited bad advice. She said that I\u2019m going to have to get over it, because I\u2019m a teenager and people are going to do that. That I\u2019m acting like an angry kid and not a parent.

You sound like a really good dad to your boy and have all the right parental instincts (whereas age has not helped Richard find his).

I can only imagine it\u2019s worse for you. I think you put him in his place. He went off & threw a tantrum. Anyone who continuously gives advice that someone doesn\u2019t want is the AH. You\u2019ve been kind for a very long time.\n\nThe woman who protected the old man & different \u201cgenerational values\u201d can get over the fact you finally stood your ground. He was disrespectful. Good case of he FA&FO to me. \n\nIt sounds like Richard & the mom expected you to respect him due to age, sorry but that\u2019s long gone in today\u2019s world & good riddance.

You didn't instigate anything, you merely replied. There's no rule that says that you have to agree with other ppl's opinions. (And you clearly know better than the both of them!).

Keep being affectionate with your little boy. You've seen first hand what kind of men \"toughened boys\" become. I feel sorry for his daughter, because the rest of the world is not going to think she is royalty, so she might have a rude awakening in front of her. Plus is must be very limiting only to be allowed to be dad's little princess. Girls also want to climb trees, get dirty, play sports and whatever else boys are normally allowed to do.", "NTA. Sounds like the guy deserved it. And no, you do not have to put up with unsolicited advice, just because you're a teenager. Tell them all that you're perfectly capable of parenting your son and that their opinions and/or advice are not needed or wanted. Also, your age has nothing to do with it. People who think they know better are going to spout off at any parent with young kids. You weren't acting like an angry child. You were acting like a fed up parent.

You're the one being the mature adult towards some intrusive busybody.

Good grief, people need to mind their own business.  Sounds to me like you're doing everything right by your son.", "NTA.
