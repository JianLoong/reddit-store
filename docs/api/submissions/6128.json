This was a tattoo that he had done ~5y ago and it\u2019s honestly not even that big (8cm by 8cm). It illustrates a tic tac toe game with three hearts in a row, and there are a series of dots beneath it that map out the phrase \u201cI will always love you\u201d (ie there are no letters but the number and spacing of the dots translate to that). \n\nNaturally this makes me incredibly uncomfortable and I have it staring at me every time we\u2019re intimate, at the beach, getting changed, etc\u2026 I\u2019ve explained to my partner that this makes me incredibly uncomfortable and that it pains me to have to think about him \u201calways\u201d loving someone else every time I see him topless. I went so far as stating that I wouldn\u2019t want to say yes to a proposal if he hadn\u2019t taken steps to remove it. \n\nInitially, he cited that this would be expensive to have removed, though he later went for a trial session where they laser off a pixel or two to make sure there are no allergic or unusual reactions. He also affirmed he\u2019d have it sorted and that he\u2019d remove it. \n\nFast forward a year later, and he still hadn\u2019t gone in for a proper first session. Money is not really a constraint anymore (he\u2019s mentioned getting more tattoos). I tried to ask him calmly what the plans were and I did my best to explain gently how it hurt me to see. He said he didn\u2019t want to get it done at the moment because it hurt too much, and that he\u2019d do it in his own time. He added that it\u2019s unreasonable for me to \u201cdemand\u201d he have it removed and that I\u2019m being disrespectful. \n\nThis is the last thing I\u2019d want to be! I love this man to bits and would love to get a sense of I\u2019m being totally out of line here.

I would never ask someone to remove a tattoo.", "NAH it's his body so he has the last word, specially when money and pain are present. He obviously made something dumb when younger, but who doesn't? And you are free to express your feelings towards it and to tell him your boundaries, as long as it is respectful,  however in MY opinion it would be to much to break up with him because of that. Maybe some therapy would help you with that. And how about cover it with another tattoo?", "NTA  This is why you don't put non spouses names on your body.

Tattoo removal is super painful, especially on ribs.

He knows thats what it actually means.  You seem to be adding a different meaning to it.  I wish I had the excess money and time to remove my first tattoo but I dont.  Looking at it reminds me I was young and stupid once unless he regularly does things that make you think he is still hung up on his ex then its time to let it go.", "soft YTA.

I don\u2019t have tattoos because even getting them seems painful.

In my opinion you shouldn\u2019t even be having to press the issue\u2026he should be wanting to do it THE MINUTE you expressed it bugged you.  Are you being jealous? You bet, and nothing wrong with that.  Please make sure you put up pictures on your nightstand of any and all old boyfriends.   Maybe he\u2019ll start to understand.\n\nAnd yes, I know I will be downvoted by the his body his choice brigade\u2026and folks\u2026I do get that,  but it bothers her, he should be willing to do it.

You need to learn how to deal with your insecurities internally and not to put the burden on others. \n\nEXPECTING him to change this tattoo is a massive overstep.

Tattoo removal has come a long way and is no longer a big deal. Depending on the density and colors of the ink, it takes 8-12 sessions to achieve a full scar-less removal.

You can\u2019t demand that somebody modify their body, even if it makes you uncomfortable. He sucks for his cavalier attitude towards the situation - I get the impression he\u2019s stringing you along with the I will do it in my time business and think he should probably just be direct in telling you that he doesn\u2019t want to do it because of xyz , or maybe he likes the tattoo and wants to keep it and is afraid to tell you that.

It seems a silly thing to fixate on, if you both really love each other. If he wants other tattoos, he could just cover it up. I know guys that I think just really, truly, would not even think about it being there and would not have some hangup about the ex. I don't know the situation, but as long as it's a good relationship, respectful and honest and all good things, I say let it go. It's his body.", "Thank you! Definitely in my head a little on this one. Consensus seems to be that IATA, so I\u2019m off to apologise!", "NTA, I think it's preettyyy reasonable on your end to want this to happen. I can see how to him it's not really a priority, but if it bothers you that much and you've made that clear, it should become a priority if he really wants to have a life with you. Also, I don't understand how he doesn't want to do it now because it hurts too much...? Will it hurt any less later..? Also, he could probably just get it covered up with something else.

If \"I don't want to feel insecure for the rest of my life\" is one of them, that's more than valid. \nSo, NTA for giving him the option (aka \"remove it or I'll break up because I personally can't deal with this\"), if that's what this is leading to.

They\u2019re going to understand that it is a very satisfying relationship and it is understood that there will be times of occasional conflict. \n\nBut describing your marriage as having its ups and downs suggests a great deal of conflict. And it\u2019s not a good marriage if there is a great deal of conflict. The fact that you\u2019re still in it, doesn\u2019t really impress me.", "God, what types of relationships are you in that you don\u2019t get this?", "No worries, sometimes you just need an outside perspective", "Yeah that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying he should just be direct with her with his feelings either way.", "This is an incredibly naive take.", "or being very honest and not giving a social media picture of a real relationship.", "No that\u2019s being realistic.", "I submit that any healthy relationship has its ups and downs. Perhaps we\u2019ll need to agree to disagree.", "Your comment has no nuance at all, just anger. Try having a discussion.", "I would say that a good marriage is 80% up and 20% down, maybe 70/30.  Saying \u201cmy marriage has its ups and downs\u201c implies closer to 50/50, especially when using it as a descriptor of the relationship. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to be talking about how marriages have difficult times and it\u2019s important to be patient and committed, etc. But to just say \u201cmy relationship has its ups and downs, but I\u2019m planning on getting married.\u201dThat sounds bad to me.\n\nImagine asking your friend about his relationship and saying \u201chow are you and Janine?\u201c And he says, we have our ups and downs, but I still love her.\u201d\n\nThat sounds very questionable to me.", "Again, I agree with that. But I think that if that phrase comes to mind when describing your marriage, then there are too many downs for the amount of ups. \n\nImagine someone selling you a used car and saying \u201cthe car has its problems, but\u2026\u201d\n\nAgain, it goes without saying that no used car is perfect; so if someone chooses to describe it as \u201chaving its problems,\u201d then it\u2019s probably not a very good car.", "Imagine comparing a marriage to a car\u2026", "If someone can't be honest with me about the car, I'd wonder what deeper issues are being hidden.", "I think mdj is going to have some rude awakenings in the coming years", "Imagine being unfamiliar with the concept of an analogy.", "It has nothing to do with honesty. Again, no used car is perfect; so it goes without saying that there will be minor problems.

Getting a cover-up tat wouldn't be as bad, he should do that. NAH, because he should have known not to get one dedicated to someone.", "NAH.

I would have eventually gotten it removed on my own anyway because it was no longer significant to me, even though to this day my tattoo ex and I remain very close friends nearly 15 years later. \n\nHowever, I will say, my ex who paid for the removal ended up being extremely controlling, jealous, and narcissistic and this was one of the many reasons I should have realized it sooner.
