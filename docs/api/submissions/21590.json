This is a huge violation of trust and if she isn\u2019t aware that\u2019s really wrong. Both the men are gross and this sounds illegal", "NTA\n\nSharing explicit contents without the permission of everyone in the content is beyond AH. It can actually be a felony in some states/countries...", "NTA Ummm tell him to sit down, open his phone and show you everything. Sending/receiving vids and photos of someone without their consent is a crime. I would tell him your going to talk to the police because you have no idea how many people have access to images of you. Then pack your stuff and leave.", "NTA\n\nYour husband and Jimmy are both completely out of line.\n\nSharing nudes and sex videos without permission is a huge violation of trust.\n\nIt shows that he doesn't care about your sexual limits,  your privacy,  your autonomy,  or what you want.      If you were just dating I would call it a red flag and tell you to dump him, because this is the sort of boundary-pushing behavior that escalates,  but you've been married for some time so I don't know what's going on here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo,  men do not share sexy pics of their wives.   For various reasons,  not the least of them being that we actually respect our wives.  But also that we generally don't want other guys getting ideas.  That sort of picture sharing is practically an invitation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not saying your husband wants Jimmy to have sex with you,  but he certainly doesn't not want that.    I would not be surprised if he suggests some swinging to you in the near future.\n\nIf you don't shut him down here he will probably want to go farther.     He will keep crossing your boundaries unless you put a stop to it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I have to ask how long he's known Jimmy.  Because with the 10-year age difference and with them spending a lot of time together.  I think it's possible that Jmmy has been grooming your husband.   It sounds silly,  your husband is in his 40s and when you think of grooming you think of kids,  but it isn't silly at all.  No one is immune to that sort of manipulation.", "NTA   This is beyond weird into illegal.   Not having your consent for this is disgusting behavior.  I doubt it's only Jimmy getting these pics.  Can you go forward with him after this betrayal?  If not, time to lawyer up and leave him.", "NTA. This isn't normal behavior. If my husband did this we'd be over immediately.", "NTA\n\nNow you also have to ask the question who else has your husband and jimmy sent the photos and vids to, and who else did those they sent them to, send them  on to others,  and so on.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a breach of trust at the highest and most intimate level.  \n\nDont know how you would ever be able to  trust him in the future.  Maybe he and jimmy have videoed other people without their knowledge.  \n\nGiven how he had no problem sharing intimate pics/vids of you, that leaves you in a very vulnerable position. He or someone else he shared the pics/vids with may have even posted them on the internet for the world to see", "NTA\u2014This is super weird, and as a man approaching 40, I would never disrespect my wife like this.

I would assume your husband has continued to share pics without your knowledge until you're 100% sure or not! I would also check your home for hidden cameras!", "NTA. You (and possibly the new gf) are unwilling participants in some kinda kink. And that's not cool. Partners should consent to each other's kinks. It's kinda a big rule.", "It doesn't matter what other people do or what may or may not be normal. What matters is that you did not consent to having your personal photos and videos shared.

This is horrifying. And I'd be single so damn fast his head would spin. Just the amount of gross disrespect and icky implications....", "No, that isn\u2019t normal at all.
