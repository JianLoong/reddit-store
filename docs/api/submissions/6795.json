I've literally never heard of that before", "NTA. She threatened to ruin your wedding day. Well, now she doesn't even get to be a guest. No wonder you don't get along well with her. She's toxic.", "NTA. Most mothers aren\u2019t in the wedding party. They\u2019re the Mother of the Bride, that\u2019s their role for the day, and it\u2019s ridiculous for her to act the way she is.", "NTA\n\nI've been to a ton of weddings, and not once has the mother ever been in the party? (usa) assuming this is a traditional western wedding this is an outrageous demand/expectation.", "NTA. It's your wedding and you get to choose who stands up with you.\n\n\"Mother of the Bride\" is typically its own role in a wedding. Your mom should be happy with that role. I gather it's not unheard of for a mother to be a Matron of Honor, but it's still unconventional, and if you don't really get along with your mom, i totally understand why you wouldn't want to even consider that.", "NTA. WHAT mother wants to be a bridesmaid at their daughter's wedding?", "NTA. Wtf. Why would she even want to be a bridesmaid? Either way, your wedding, your rules. Her hissy fit goes to show that she isn\u2019t mature enough to handle this role. Maybe a little niece or little cousin could fill the role instead? Might fit the theme a little better", "Good Lord, why on earth would your mother think she'd be an ideal bridesmaid?  \n\n\nNTA.", "NTA YOUR wedding. YOUR rules. She can go have fun at a wedding where she is not trying to wrest some control from THE BRIDE. Mom sounds like she may have some narc tendencies, best to keep her at arm's length. Congratulations, and DEFINITELY keep that security plan in place and hand out her photo to all and give them specific instructions to have her removed for trespassing at the venue. \n\nI am really sorry that you have to deal with a parent like this. Some parents don't get they DON'T raise children...they raise humans to BECOME adults...their control has to be loosened over time, but unfortunately, if the parent refuses to loosen, the offspring will just break those ties rather than staying chained.  Some people are okay with controlling parents, psychologically HEALTHY ADULTS are not. \n\nKeep that shine spiny and your boundaries strong. Don't let her get into your head, this is YOUR WEDDING. Enjoy this great day with people who love and support you instead of those who try to tear you down.", "Wow. Mom is the AH here. \n\nFirst of all, it would be unusual to have the mother of the bride be a bridesmaid. \n\nSecondly, no one has a right to throw a fit about not being asked to be a bridesmaid.

Either way NTA your wedding, your choice.\n\nEdit typo", "My mom's my best friend and she wasn't a bridesmaid at my wedding.\n\n\nLike she isnt concerned that she is not in a formal role of mother of the bride, but thinks she should be a bridesmaid?  Oh so she can be up front for attention?\n\n\nMake sure to give security pictures of her to ensure she isnt let in.\n\n\nNTA", "Ummm....what??? No, NTA. That's a super weird thing of her to assume, and threatening to ruin your wedding was WAY TOO FAR. It goes without saying that you can have whomever you want in and at your wedding. I do hope you don't invite her back if you make amends as it doesn't seem like she's stable enough to trust (speaking from experience).", "NTA. It is not traditional for a mother to be a bridesmaid because you know they are supposed to be maids so it is a bit odd she would expect to be included. Now if you wanted her as a bridesmaid that would be perfectly fine but if you don't then that is fine too as it is entirely up to you not her. Her reaction really confirms she shouldn't be at the wedding whatsoever", "NTA I have never ever heard of a mother being a bridesmaid, even the most entitled mothers usually just want to wear a bridal gown and BE the bride. That's real weird. You were right to not have her in the bridal party!", "NTA \n\nNever ever have I seen a mother as a bridesmaid!\n\nPlus she is toxic \n\nSo meh!
