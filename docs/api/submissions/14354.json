She had a premature delivery that lead to complications and eventually, she passed away an hour after giving birth to our daughter. My daughter too had resulting complications which meant she had to be kept in a NICU for the first 2 months of her life. \n\nNeedless to be said, the entire ordeal was hard on us, especially her mother, who was a single mom to her only child. Fortunately, my daughter's condition grew better after those initial 2 months, and is as lively and joyful as any other 1 year old.\n\nIt was my baby's first birthday a few days ago. It was bittersweet. I wished my wife could've been here to see our baby girl on her first milestone.  I wanted to honor my wife's memory and also make my daughter feel the presence of her mother on her special day. My wife used to have a talent for stitching, and she'd taught me a lot of it too. \n\nMy wife had worn a beautiful dark green gown for her maternity shoots. She looked absolutely radiant in it that day, but after that she never wore it again. She said she wanted to see my daughter wear it one day. The gown was left forgotten there with her entire pile of clothes after her death. I didn't want to go through her stuff since it would've been too much for me.\n\nHer words, the grief of knowing that my wife never got to know her daughter and my daughter's birthday were what motivated me to get up one day, go through her closet and cut up that green gown into a tiny frock for my daughter. And my daughter looked absolutely adorable in it. That colour suits my daughter just as it did to my wife.\n\nI dressed up my daughter in the gown for the birthday party. My MIL saw her in it and immediately knew that this was that dress. She pulled me aside, in tears, and asked me why I would destroy her daughter's dress. I told her what my wife had said, that this was her wish too. She said that my wife would've meant that for when my daughter was old enough to fit into the gown. That she could've also said that assuming she would be alive to see her in it, and that her death negates what she said. Her dress held a memory of my wife that no longer existed now because of what I did.\n \nI told her that the dress had been lying forgotten in the closet along with all of her other belongings. All her other special dresses are still there, her wedding gown, her baby shower dress, everything was still intact and perfectly preserved in her closet. It was just this one dress that I used. The dress she specifically mentioned she wanted our daughter to wear one day. I honoured her wishes, a little earlier than intended.\n\nThe argument escalated, with other people joining in and taking sides. Soon, my MIL left, along with most of the guests. She isn't replying to my calls. All our relatives have mixed opinions about this.\n\nI am devastated. All I wanted to do was make this birthday extra special for my daughter. Instead, her entire day ended in tears. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681039948, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ggv6f/aita_for_repurposing_my_late_wifes_gown_for_my/", "score": 4897, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You created a beautiful tribute to your wife. You now have your wife\u2019s maternity shoot photos and your daughter\u2019s first birthday photos wearing the same piece of clothing. There\u2019s not only still the memories of your wife wearing it but now new beautiful memories of your daughter wearing it. \n\nI WAS going to go with N A H owing to your MIL still grieving her child, but given how she took an already difficult event and attached bad memories to it by escalating the argument and invoking the other guests, I\u2019m giving YOU the benefit of the doubt.", "NTA.  \n\n\nYou honored your wife and extended her love and presence to your daughter. And as you said, it was a dress, she only wore for her maternity photo shoot. Maternity shoots weren't even a thing 20 years ago, so it doesn't have the same gravitas or historical importance as other dresses, such as the wedding dress. You did absolutely nothing wrong.    \n\n\nBut grief is a tough thing, and people grieve in different ways, and grief isn't always rational. Your MIL is being irrational right now. Hopefully she will calm down and eventually apologize to you.", "NTA. I think your wife would have been delighted to know that her dress was right there to accompany your daughter on her first birthday. I understand why your MIL would be upset but she doesn't have any authority over your wife's maternity dress.", "NAH. Your daughter's first birthday is unfortunately also the first anniversary of your wife's death and that is a hard day (as I am sure you know). Your MIL is probably fighting all kinds of feelings and was overwhelmed by seeing the dress and realizing that the future she had hoped for her daughter was lost forever and she might have complicated feelings towards your daughter that she might be afraid to even voice. \n\nBut what you did was a beautiful and lovely thing. I would frame side by side pictures of your wife and daughter both in the dress and put them in your daughter's room.", "NAH. I don't think MIL is an AH; repurposing an adult's dress for a 1 year old is your choice, but it also means this isn't a dress your daughter will now get to wear over and over again because she'll grow out of it. I can see why MIL was upset. That said, you aren't an AH either. It's just a sad situation for you all.", "NAH.  It sounds like your MIL is understandably upset and grieving in her own way.  It\u2019s not fair to you that she is lashing out about the dress but I don\u2019t think it makes her an AH in this circumstance.  Give her some space for the time being and reach out in the relatively near future (~1 month) if you haven\u2019t heard from her.  You\u2019ve already apologized so continuing to reach out will likely only serve to make her more resentful.  \n\nGood luck, OP.  You\u2019ve been through a lot and it sounds like you\u2019re trying to do your best in a terribly difficult situation.  There really is no playbook for navigating these kinds of situations and you\u2019ll undoubtedly upset people along the way, but that does not always mean you\u2019ve gotten it wrong.  This is a good example of that.", "NAH, It's quite touching what you did and at the end of the day the dress belongs to you by default. \n\nBut...... you've overlooked your MIL also lost a daughter, so it may have been better if you told her of what you wanted to do, just so she was mentally prepared to see the dress again.", "NTA\u2014 even if she didn\u2019t understand the choice, she chose to ruin the day. \nYou can\u2019t keep your house a museum to your wife\u2014 you found a beautiful way to live with her memory and keep it alive. \nIt\u2019s kind of you to invite your wife\u2019s mother and other family to your daughter\u2019s birthday party but you don\u2019t really have to anymore. She should understand that if she makes a habit of attacking you, she won\u2019t get invited anymore. I get that it\u2019s sad for her to lose your daughter and be at the mercy of her husband to get any access to your granddaughter but that\u2019s how it is.", "It's not their decision. You haven't done anything wrong.\n\nNta", "NAH - you and your MIL are still grieving and everyone grieves differently. You did something to honor your wife in a way you felt appropriate. Your MIL has a different perspective. I think, to mend some bridges, have a conversation with MIL about how to continue honoring your wife going forward and also what to do with her belongings.", "NAH, you're all suffering here  Nobody was deliberately looking to hurt anyone else, it was just a hugely difficult day all round and emotions spilled over.  Anger is often used to mask other emotions, being angry, upset and blaming you would have been easier to cope with than the devastation of the anniversary of the loss of her daughter.", "First - the most sincerest of condolences on your loss.  \nSecond - NTA. You\u2019re in a difficult enough situation.  You are doing the best you can.  Honoring your wife\u2019s wishes the best way you can is beautiful thing.  \nYour family will have mixed emotions about  everything you do because your wife isn\u2019t there.  It may be difficult for many years but they\u2019ll come to accept that you\u2019re doing the best you can.  Good luck, OP.  Hugs from a stranger.", "NTA  this sounds like a good way for you to process your grief and include your late wife's memory in an important milestone for you daughter.  You likely will keep a few important dresses for your daughter but it's unfair to expect you to keep them all.  It's a shame that .your in laws reacted so poorly.  Happy Birthday to your daughter!", "Idk about aita but I'm ugly crying rn", "NAH. \n\nYour MIL lost her only daughter, and your baby's birthday is the anniversary of that life-rending tragedy. It would be both wise and kind to include her in future birthday plans both for her grieving process and for the benefit of your daughter.", "NAH.\n\nYou are grieving. Your MIL is grieving. Grief can cause us to have almost a primal protection over things we used to barely give a second thought to, even when we feel we are working through our grief. \n\nYour MIL reacted to something her daughter loved, but only used briefly, being re-purposed. This was something her daughter once wore, and she reacted in the way that came most naturally to her and her grief in that moment. \n\nYou created a beautiful thing for your daughter out of a beautiful thing purchased to celebrate her existence. The wound is still fresh for your MIL, as I\u2019m sure it still is for you, and she\u2019s reaching the anger stage of her grief, which more comes in random tidal waves than anything. \n\nAny of your wife\u2019s belongings can still be used by your daughter when she grows up. Things that were cherished by her that can allow your daughter to feel close to her. \n\nYour relatives have mixed emotions because no one is in the wrong. This day would have ended in tears regardless. It\u2019s the reality of one of the many firsts your wife, and your MIL\u2019s daughter, will miss. Everyone is still grieving, and ready to put their emotions on something else.", "NTA sounds like a lovely thing to do for your daughter. My mum died a couple of years ago. She used to wear very full skirts that contained a lot of fabric. My lovely friend used the fabric from some of her favourite skirts to make teddy bears for me and my children. \n\nWhen your daughter has grown out of the dress maybe you can save it for if she has a daughter or put it on a special teddy or doll for her to keep. \nI can understand this would be an emotive situation for your MIL but she can\u2019t expect you to keep everything that meant something to your daughter as is.", "NTA. That was a touching tribute.  I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "You are NTA, OP. \n\nGrief is such a heavy and difficult thing the go through and live with. Your MIL wants to preserve her daughter\u2019s memory with possessions, but her granddaughter is what keeps her daughter alive, not a dress. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you lost your wife and your daughter lost her mother. I\u2019m so sorry for all of you still navigating the channels of grief. \n\nYou did nothing wrong and, in time, your MIL will (hopefully) see that and apologize.", "I think you knew your wife meant your daughter to wear that dress when she was all grown up and you knew the dress was important to you MIL too. Your wife left the dress to your daughter as it was. You had a nice thought but it didn't go as you planned. Still I think it would be too strong to state that you're the a-hole. So NTA. \n\nEverybody seems to be very emotional because the death was not too long ago and it was not expected. I feel for you. Take some good pictures of your daughter in the green dress. Or have a professional photoshoot. Put the picture next your wife's in the same dress. Send those to your MIL too. She will come around.", "I am so sorry that what you wanted to do as a beautiful tribute was reacted to by others\u2019 grief so negatively. NAH. Grief sucks and everyone\u2019s grief journey is different.", "NAH - because you destroyed the gown, your MIL for making things more difficult than they needed to be. \n\n\nBut you are both grieving and I'm not about to call you both TA because of the way you are grieving, because you are both at the centre of the loss and you are both not thinking 100% clearly.", "NTA, that dress meant your wife had a physical presence at her daughter's first birthday. I personally would of loved that idea. Yeah it might of been earlier than intended but your wife also intended to be there for that for that moment. I think it was a beautiful gesture and while I understand MILs grief she over reacted and couldn't see it for the wonderful act it was.", "NTA. I thought it was going to be the wedding dress. \n\nThis was a lovely idea. Your MIlL is obviously struggling with her grief. Give her some space and when you\u2019re both ready, maybe ask her if there\u2019s something special she\u2019d like to keep?", "NTA. It's easy to understand why some people are upset, but I think the sentiment is touching. Your daughter might also find it touching when she's older. Or she might be upset. There's still the wedding dress and my advice is to protect it with your life.", "NAH. Just a lot of people with very raw emotions trying to deal with grief in their own way. There's no logic here, nobody is acting out to purposefully spite anyone else, and nobody is being unreasonably selfish. The worst that could be said is that someone is not handling their grief very well, and... I mean, who does?", "NAH but I would save the rest of your wife's heirlooms for when your daughter is old enough to appreciate them.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. NTA. You did a nice thing that was motivated by love. Hopefully your MIL will see that one day when things are less raw.", "NTA, your MIL is grieving but her creating a scene at your daughters birthday party is unacceptable. I\u2019m sure your wife would have loved that her dress and in turn she herself was present at your daughters birthday. Your MIL need to learn to respect you as your daughters only parent, or understand that she\u2019s going to kill a relationship with her granddaughter.", "NTA you have ownership over the dress.", "1000% NTA\n\nMIL Is trying to fill a daughter sized hole with a dress. It won\u2019t work.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for both of your losses and SO GLAD your daughter is thriving.", "NTA she is your wife and it's your choice how her intentions are interpreted.so sorry people are doing this to you.", "NTA- I think it\u2019s lovely what you did. I hope you have lots of pictures of her in her beautiful dress. It\u2019s even so much more special that you made it for her. Now she has a connection to you both. A touching way to remember her mom, and a keepsake from you.\n\nI\u2019m sorry her party turned divisive and ended in anger. You are both just grieving in your own way. Hopefully some space for a few days will allow you both to process. Maybe once the dust has settled you can have a little photoshoot with your little girl in her dress with her grandma. Then you can have some special new memories in the dress. Maybe even take some pictures of her in places or doing things your wife liked while in the dress too?\n\nHope you all find healing, so sorry for your loss \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. What you did was a wonderful tribute to your late wife, and now the dress can be preserved as a keepsake for your daughter. When she's old enough to understand, you can tell her the story behind the dress. \n\nYou had the best of intentions and it's just a shame that your MIL was triggered so strongly by the sight of the dress. You had no way of anticipating that kind of reaction. Like you said, the dress had been laying there unnoticed since your wife's death.", "NTA", "NTA. This is about you, your late wife and your daughter. Your MIL needs to realize this. I think what you did was lovely and your daughter will appreciate it when she's old enough to understand.", "Nah!! and I'm so very sorry!", "NTA but almost NAH. You had every right to do what you did and it would be reasonable to expect your MIL to approve of it. However she is also grieving so whilst her reaction/attitude is wrong she should be given a lot of leeway. \n\nI think a face to face conversation after a couple of days will settle it and likely have you both crying together apologising to each other", ">\tNeedless to be said, the entire ordeal was hard on us, especially her mother,\n\nDying can be a very traumatic experience. I can\u2019t imagine how you\u2019d get back up from that.", "NTA - I would have said no As here if not for the escalation of the mil. Her concerns were valid, but after you explained your side it's just like crying over spilled milk & trying to make you pay for it", "Dude you\u2019re amazing. You did I thing wrong. These people suck.", "When your daughter outgrows the dress, save it for her future child. If you saved the rest of the fabric, make a quilt.", "NTA - wow, she was way offbase.", "NTA! It is so sweet. She can feel close to her mother!", "You're obviously nta, how you and your daughter grieve and find joy is yours and yours alone.", "NTA whatsoever. You have now made a beautiful and sentimental reminder of your wife. It\u2019s something your daughter can pass down to her kids and have them wear it on their first birthday. \n\nYour MIL is way out of line. It wasn\u2019t your wife\u2019s only dress. I\u2019m sure there are plenty of mementos of your wife for your daughter and MIL to have. She doesn\u2019t get to decide what happens. You do and you did a great job.", "NTA\nYour MIL ruined your daughter's bday and is doubling down and isolating you from your late wife's family.\nUnfortunately, for your and your daughter's wellbeing, you may have to cut her out of your life", "EDIT: \n\nNTA\n\nI originally commented YTA, and made a large blurb on how OP should have been more respectful of the the dress but realized that may have been too harsh. A recent death in my family and the way relatives have squabbled over each and every aspect of his legacy has lead me to develop a very cynical view on grief and the way people process death. I am a much more discreet and private individual myself. I projected these feelings when I shouldn\u2019t have; OP has the right to grieve in his own way, and this was probably the best way to do it. So again, my apologies.", "NTA.\n\nThis is just weird on MIL's part (and a bit yours for the preserved 'baby shower dress').\n\nThese dresses now belong to you (presumably). So, you get to choose what to do with them.\n\nYour wife said she hopes your daughter will wear this someday--she very likely said a lot of things during her pregnancy about her hopes for her child. That doesn't mean the dress was particularly sentimental, and certainly not that it absolutely had to be preserved until the point your daughter fits it (or if and when she is herself pregnant).\n\nShe also 'wanted to see' your daughter wear it. The fact that is tragically not possible isn't changed regardless of what happens to the dress.\n\nThe memories are the memories and the photos, ffs. I have no idea what your MIL was going on about.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss, and you seem to understand how much your MIL is grieving. She is in fact an AH here and needs to let you live and use your things and your late wife's things as you see fit and raise your daughter as you wish.\n\nLet it lie. Your MIL may recover some sanity about this. I'm sorry your family sees fit to get involved; they have nothing to do with this and if they mention it to you, you need to tell them so.\n\nAll the best to you and your daughter.", "NTA, but they are for making a big deal about it and leaving. \n\nThe MIL is still grieving, but she was the AH. It\u2019s not her call and it\u2019s not a dress left to her, she\u2019s just in grief.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Give her space because she may be feeling raw right now.\n\nBut you, in no way did anything wrong. If you still have all your wife\u2019s clothes maybe look into creating something like a pillow for your daughter as another way to connect your daughter to her mum.", "NTA  at all and a lovely way to incorporate your wife's memory into the birthday.    I'm sorry that the drama ruined the party.", "NTA I think you should have a heart to heart with your MIL after things have calmed down a bit. You're both dealing with the loss differently and that day was definitely going to bring back some sad memories. \n\nYou should explain how you did what you did to honour your wife's wish/memory and in a way have her there for your daughter's first birthday, but also recognise your MIL's feelings and how you should have discussed it with her or given her a heads up before doing so. \n\nI'm sorry for your loss, Happy Birthday to your daughter and I hope you reconcile with your MIL.", "Nta. You're all grieving, she's used this instance to take her frustration out, unfairly so, but grief makes us all a bit crazy. Give her time. If she's a quality person, she'll want to be back in your daughter's lives and apologize.", "NTA. Because what if your daughter didn\u2019t want to wear that dress when she got older? Then no one would have seen her in it. But if your daughter decides to have any kids, she can dress them in it for their first birthday too.", "NTA - I\u2019m so sorry for your loss, what you did was incredibly heart felt and beautiful. I\u2019m going to say something that may come across as harsh but I think MiL needs some logic and realism once she\u2019s calmed down. Your daughter is a separate person to your wife. She will not be able to dress Daughter up in your wife\u2019s preserved clothing and have her daughter back. Let\u2019s be real for a moment, will your daughter grow up to be the same size and shape as your wife? What if she\u2019s a lot bigger or far too small? Will MiL put pressure on her to be the same size so she can wear her dead mothers clothes? What if your Daughter doesn\u2019t *want* to wear the clothes? I have the horrible foreboding feeling that MiL is going to put a lot on your daughter now she\u2019s lost hers. With the new dress your daughter has a beautiful heirloom that\u2019s something of BOTH her parents now. The dress her mother wore and the dress her father made with nothing but love in his heart. I think that\u2019s a far more valuable momento than a dress that was worn once for a photoshoot. She has something extra special now and you made that happen for her. She\u2019s a lucky little girl to have you.", "NTA. You honored the spirit of your wife\u2019s wishes while living with the realities of life with her gone. Keep being a thoughtful parent.", "NTA You are all grieving, your hearts are broken.  Mil is a bad griever in this instance.  She failed with the one person who is hurting as much as she is.  You will grieve in your way, she will grieve in hers.  You will both fail each other because the hurt is too great to bear at times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni am so sorry for your hurt on that day and all the others.  I am glad you have a thriving daughter to embrace.  Be well.", "NTA\u2026I have an unhealthy emotional attachment to objects from my past and realize that it is due to being unable to process unresolved feelings from my life. I essentially boxed and stored them and left them to revisit later. It\u2019s less about the objects themselves but the feelings and memories that they evoke. I\u2019m now in my 60\u2019s and many items remain untouched and their stories unpackaged.\n\nI commend you for the courage to revisit a difficult experience and literally fashion a beautiful and special commemoration of your wife\u2019s dress, your hands together with your daughter for her first birthday. You are doing what your MIL is also needing to do but is extremely difficult\u2026grieve and let go. It takes time and your MIL obviously had her own meltdown upon seeing the dress\u2026NTA.", "NTA What you did was heartfelt and amazing! Grieving is hard. It's one garment. I hope she comes around. Best wishes, you're doing fantastic as a father so far.", "Nta. Grief can be irrational, but that doesn\u2019t excuse people from being assholes while they\u2019re grieving. Repurposing the dress, you did a lovely thing, for your daughter, your late wife, and yourself. It could\u2019ve been a lovely thing for MIL too, but it\u2019s not your fault she\u2019s not receptive to it now.", "You did nothing wrong.  You did a wonderful name.", "NTA - of course MIL is still grieving... but did everyone forget you are too.  \n\nI'm sorry for your loss and I'm sure the dress was beautiful. Take the dress and go do something fun just the two of you. It doesn't matter what it is. Maybe take good photos and find someone who can combine the pictures of your daughter and wife in the same dress, and display it proudly in your home. It could be a beautiful way  to celebrate the love of both of them.\n\n I'm sorry that your MIL's grief overshadowed the celebration.\n\n Make good memories. Enjoy life.", "Hopefully she will calm down and eventually apologize to you.", "Nta, I think this is a very beautiful way to have your wife celebrating with you. I understand why your MIL got upset, but at the end of the day, you did something nice and thoughtful with the dress.", "You did absolutely NOTHING wrong!  NTA.", "NTA. You did a beautiful thing for your precious daughter. I\u2019m sure your wife is watching over you appreciating how you honored her. I\u2019m sure your MIL is just going through a hard time and got emotional, which is understandable since she lost her daughter. She didn\u2019t handle it the best and that put quite a damper on things but just know that it\u2019s not your fault. I\u2019m sure she feels guilty on her end too. I wouldn\u2019t reach out anymore. If she wants to see her granddaughter she\u2019s going to have to reach out to you anyway. I\u2019d just wait it out and tell her you are sorry it was hard for her to see the dress altered but that you didn\u2019t do anything wrong and you did a nice thing. \n\nI\u2019m also really really sorry for your loss. You seem like such a great dad and are doing everything to do what you can for your family. Your little girl is in great hands.", "Clothes don't hold memories, people do. You made a beautiful memory for your daughter, your MIL made a horrible one.", "NTA, you did a really wonderful, beautiful thing. As a motherless daughter I would've LOVED something like this. So sorry for your loss friend.", "NTA. I personally would have waited until the daughter was old enough to understand the significance because there's no way she'll remember her first birthday. But you had every right to do it whenever you wanted. Grandma should not have made a huge scene over it.", "NTA", "Absolutely NTA!! What a beautiful, thoughtful, loving gesture, and even more meaningful because you had the ability to create it yourself. I am so very sorry for the pain you all suffer and I\u2019m sure your poor MIL was lashing out blindly but that doesn\u2019t make it any less hurtful for you. I\u2019m so sorry. Please don\u2019t doubt yourself or what you did; this was a wonderful thing! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "NAH, just people grieving differently. I\u2019m sorry for your loss and glad your little girl is doing well. You both interpreted what your late wife said differently. I\u2018d definitely have taken it like your MIL but don\u2019t think your way was wrong either - it\u2019s easy to see it like that when you\u2019re not involved in the situation. Your MIL is grieving her only child so I\u2018m not prepared to call her an AH over this on the first anniversary of your wife\u2019s death. Likewise, I wouldn\u2019t have cut it up for a 1yo simply because she\u2018ll be grown out of it within weeks, but certainly won\u2019t call you an AH over doing it because it felt right. \n\nI hope you\u2019re all getting support for your grief. \ud83d\udc99", "Nta at all. Honestly NAH, your MIL is obviously still grieving as I'm sure you are, too. It sounds like she was overcome by emotion, but you didn't do anything wrong. I think it was a beautiful thing you did and I bet your daughter looked beautiful in it. I'm so sorry for your loss. Let your MIL be, she probably just needs time.", "My condolences. nta.. but some distance between you and your mil... is in order.. you late wife's belongings are yours and you will be eventually  moving on with your life..expect more blow ups..", "NAH. It's a tough situation. I get MILs feelings, but you created a beautiful keepsake for your daughter. Can the photographer who did the maternity shoot take photos of your daughter in the dress and maybe stitch a maternity image together with daughter in her dress? Or have the dress shadow boxed or preserved, maybe one day her daughter can wear it too. A beautiful tribute to your wife that can span generations?", "This is the simplest case of NTA I\u2019ve read on here yet. Your MIL does not get to dictate how you honor your late wife. I think what you did with the dress was beautiful and your wife was certainly smiling down on both of you. She would definitely be disappointed in the rest of the family, because they are the ones acting like AHs. MIL took a special day and made it all about her, not about your daughter or your wife.", "NTA!!! Lots of great comments here.", "NAH - you made a mistake. A dress your daughter could have kept her whole adult like is now a dress she will grow out of in a few weeks. It's disappointing but you were doing the best you could through your grief. I'm so sorry for your loss.", "I hated when people take sides (except on Reddit). All the people on the birthdayparty should have tried to calm MIL down and build bridges instead of polarize.", "This is the big thing for me. For her to be unable to give son in law the benefit of the doubt OR prioritize her granddaughter (both of whom are just as bereft by this death as she is) it telling. OR, for that matter, the spirit of what she *knows* her daughter would have wanted. \n\nIt\u2019s a dress. Her daughter can\u2019t wear it anymore. Her granddaughter is experiencing an incredibly meaningful moment and getting joy out of it, which is the point. \n\nDoes MIL honest to Jesus think her daughter would approve of how she behaved today? I think not. She\u2019s not protecting her late daughter\u2019s wishes or belongings. She\u2019s holding other people responsible for preserving her memories of her daughter. Which is unfair.\n\nAnd to involve the other guests rather than just excusing herself quietly is inexcusable.  Your granddaughter and son in law are what you have left of your daughter. Not her dresses that don\u2019t belong to you in the first place. If you want to risk losing them over a dress, then you can go home and cry over pictures of her in the dress and leave your son in law and granddaughter out of it. \n\nOP, I would be firm about this. While grandmother is grieving, this explains her feelings but not her behaviour. Reassure your daughter that her mother would be proud and that seeing her in that dress was a beautiful thing. And let your MIL know that, while you appreciate her grief, you will NOT allow your daughter to take the brunt of her projections. You and MIL at least HAVE memories of your late wife to cherish. Your daughter deserves to feel a connection to her. \n\nAnd until MIL can appreciate and honour that, then she will not be welcome into your lives or to share in the memory of her daughter alongside the two of you. She can share her grief in solidarity with the living, is she can stay at home and mourn her daughter alone", "I could not agree more. OP created a beautiful story around both his daughter and late wife, using a meaningful momento. His daughter will always cherish both sets of photos, and he gave what would otherwise be a garment with sadness attached a new purpose and a new life. I think it's beautiful.\n\nI feel for MIL because she too has experienced a significant loss. People grieve in different ways. But to vilify OP for what was a lovely, thoughtful way of honouring his wife is what makes this NTA instead of NAH.", "I agree! Also NTA. I know the MIL is grieving her daughter & it\u2019s very hard on a mother but this day is about her granddaughter. He didn\u2019t ruin the dress, throw it away or do anything to disrespect his wife\u2019s memory. He actually did something beautiful that honored her and his daughter! \nSending you love and happiness OP! You deserve it", "MIL definitely made it all about her. Not the baby, not even OP\u2019s late wife.\n\nI was skimming the post at first and with the way MIL reacted I thought it was the wedding gown OP repurposed. Repurposing the maternity dress for the first birthday was an amazing idea. It\u2019s like, hey baby\u2019s finally here and can now wear the cloth covering the then-bump on mommy\u2019s belly!\n\nIf anything I\u2019m glad it\u2019s only baby\u2019s first birthday. At least she won\u2019t remember how awful people acted.\n\nHugs, OP!", "And how the I want to see my daughter wear it someday was interpreted by OP was his right. He lost someone too and he wanted her to share a part of his daughter's day. \n\nThis was his right. Maybe MIL.needs a little distance. She ruined what should have been a happy day. Thank goodness his daughter will have no memories of that day.", "This \u2b06\ufe0f", "I agree with the thoughtful post above and just wanted to add that you sound like an awesome Dad.", "Totally agree, well said! Also, there's no guarantee your daughter would have ever worn the maternity dress for a shoot. She may decide to not have kids, it's not a given that that is her path. This way she got to wear it like her mom wanted in such a beautiful tribute.", "She needs to remember HE is grieving too", "I agree, it likely took her by surprise and she didn't handle it well, doesn't excuse her behaviour but as you said, grief isn't always rational.", "I agree completely. When the late mother said she'd like to see her daughter wear the dress \"one day,\" it could be interpreted as wearing it when it would fit her (my thinking too) or modified so the daughter could wear it any point in the future.\n\nMy late mother's wedding dress was kept, but coffee spilt on it before it was packed away for 3 decades. This meant there was no way my sister could use it when she got married. Instead, my sister cut off a piece and sewed it into the train of her gown. If I get married, I'm going to use some of the fabric to create a flower to wear on my dress. It's been repurposed, and since our mom was an excellent crafter, we're using it in a way that she'd love.", "There is no guarantee his daughter would ever need a maternity dress. Or fit the same size as her mother. \nAnd I doubt anyone wears a maternity gown \u201cover and over\u201d anyway.", "Not only lost a daughter but the birthday is the first anniversary of the daughter's death. I definitely agree NAH and this is just a hard situation all around.", "Agreed, except please do not send the images to your MIL unless she specifically asks. Keep those to yourself.", "OP didn\u2019t destroy the gown. He repurposed it beautifully. His wife has tons of clothes and possessions to save. Also why should MIL have any say on what he does with the maternity dress? He is the father of the baby. He has more right to that dress than she does.", "It's also the anniversary of her daughter's death.", "He means his wife's mother?", "Ok but dress styles change a lot. By the time the daughter is old enough to really wear the dress it\u2019s likely to be very out of fashion. I.e get one or two photo op wears for the same purpose of putting it next to the picture of mom.  So I maintain NAH.", "I could never wear any of my mother's clothes, even if I wanted too. I am several inches taller and a completely different build. So saving clothes with that intention is always a crapshoot. \n\nAlso who knows if daughter will ever have her own children there is no guarantee that she would ever have need for a maternity dress.\n\nInstead, OP made sure that she got to wear the dress. He can save the baby dress (and also presumably the rest of the stress material). I would suggest he get professional photos of his daughter in the dress and then they can have the pictures side by side, which would be a beautiful memento for his daughter. .", "His wife wanted their teen daughter to wear a maternity gown? I doubt that. \n\nAnd what if she\u2019s significantly larger than her mother? Never gets pregnant? Doesn\u2019t want the gown???", "The daughter is only 1. I think explaining that much is a little beyond her.", "The child is 1 year old, she won\u2019t be able to cherish this moment for at least another 9-14 years when she\u2019s old enough to understand. The grandmother didn\u2019t ruin this moment for the baby, the baby has no idea what\u2019s going. Doesn\u2019t make sense", " Happy Birthday to your daughter!", " I hope she comes around. Best wishes, you're doing fantastic as a father so far.", "There's also the fact that there's no guarantee the daughter will have a similar enough body type to her mother to wear it, even if she does decide to get pregnant and have a maternity shoot. I know I certainly wouldn't be able to wear any clothes my mother wore at my age (no, not even if I lost weight, our body shapes are just that different), so if she had left me a wedding gown or a maternity gown like that it would not have been usable for me except as fabric.", "Obv, either way it'd need to be altered. My only point was taking it from an adult dress to a dress for a 1 year old was a dramatic change and I can see why MIL was shocked and upset. Doesn't mean OP is an AH in any shape or form.", "This, there\u2019s no guarantee she would make it to the age of her being able to wear it as well. I understand MIL is grieving, but she is still on the verge of AH here. I\u2019m sure her daughter would be pissed how she handled things, NTA", "Yes, and she made it about herself and created a scene for something that could have been a private conversation at a later date.", "He hadn\u2019t mentioned her at all at that point and the last person he did mention was his daughter. \u201cher mother\u201d then implies his late wife.", "My mom saved her wedding dress for my sister and I. Even if she was deceased, neither of us would/could wear it. My mom is tiny, the dress is extremely dated, and we wanted our own memories.", "NAH. I am so sorry for your loss.\n\nYou're both grieving. This should never have escalated into an argument and all the people around you who joined in, rather than try to calm you both down, are AHs. You did a beautiful thing, but your MIL interpreted it differently. If you lost your only child, you might be overly-sensitive about keeping her memory too. \n\nLet her know that you aren't trying to be disrespectful towards your wife's memory, and make sure she knows that she's welcome in her granddaughter's life. You'll both have an easier time getting through this if you support each other. And you both have in common the love you feel for your little girl. This should be stronger than any material object.", "NAH.  \nI can see both sides of the issue here. I can imagine she was looking forward to seeing her daughter wear that dress when she was older, so would be a hell of a shock to see it early with no forewarning.", "First... I'm so sorry for your loss, it's great to hesr your little girl is thriving!\ud83d\udc95\n\nAs for judgement....Absolutely not! What a beautiful tribute! I may have felt differently if it was her actual wedding gown as in the future your daughter may want to wear it herself.  Honestly though even if you did your heart was in the right place and you transformed it for her own daughter and in no way tarnished her memory. You can still preserve the green dress for future granddaughters on their first birthday!\n\nYour mother in law is grieving too and I'm sure it was just a shock for her to recognize the dress. Grief creeps up on us in the weirdest ways at the strangest times. She handled the situation poorly but her feelings were what they are, though we may not understand them they are valid to her. Give her some time and when she is ready you can have a nice conversation. She won't stay away forever she'll want to see her grand baby.  \ud83d\udc95", "NAH. It is incredibly sweet that you made your daughter a special outfit for her birthday. It is also understandable that MIL is still struggling with the grief of losing her only child and is misdirecting that grief.", "NAH.\n\nIt is difficult for you, you lost your wife, but it is also difficult for your MIL, she lost her daughter.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you all are going through this. Good luck.", "NAH. People grieve differently. \nYour MIL lost her child. You lost your wife. \nShe has a right to her feelings as do you. I don\u2019t believe any side has malicious intend, just opposing views on the matter. You both need time and space to grieve and to heal. Bereavement counselling would be a good idea too. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "NAH\n\n\nFeelings are weird and illogical. Just chalk it up to her grief. That was probably one of the best things you could have done with that gown.\n\nOnly other alternative I could see:\n\n1) Bury it with her. \n2) let it sit in the closet forgotten. \n3) donate it to a thrift store. \n\nNone of them bring your wife back. And none of those have anything to do with your wife's association with that dress.", "NAH\n\u201c I honoured her wishes, a little earlier than intended\u201d\n\nNot about to call anyone an asshole. But confused, you say you know it was supposed to be for later, but you did cut it up earlier? So it makes sense why your MIL was shocked and super upset because it was supposed to be for when she was older. Especially because her birthday isn\u2019t just her birthday, her little girls anniversary is also the same day.\n\nEdit:\n\nFrom OP\n\u201c I feel like my wife's death may have negated her earlier words that said my daughter could wear that gown. And also that my wife meant it as to when my daughter would be old enough to fit into the dress, especially when she was alive. This is a memory I may have unintentionally destroyed\u201d\n\nDidn\u2019t see the above before so this clarifies it for me. Not gonna call OP an asshole cuz obviously this situation sucks. But if your wife said specifically this dress is for your child when she grew up, of course your wife\u2019s mommy is gonna be like WTF. She wants to do what her daughter wanted, to preserve her goals in life because her daughter isn\u2019t able to.", "Just like you, your MIL is grieving, so maybe that\u2019s why she reacted the way she did. It doesn\u2019t make it right but when we are hurting we make mistakes.\n\nYou are absolutely NTA. What you did with the dress, I think is beautiful and very loving towards both your deceased wife and your little daughter \u2764\ufe0f\n\nThe guests who were taking sides on the other hand are absolutely the a-holes here. They should have diffused the situation instead of escalating it. Wtf is wrong with them?", "If I'm baffled just reading their reaction I can't imagine how hurt and confused you must be.\n\nTHAT is not just a genius idea, it got directly to the heart of your loss and your child's. Your daughter now has a dress she'll treasure forever, connecting she with her mother forever.\n\nSO NTA. I'm so sorry for your and your daughter's loss.", "NTA\n\nIn my opinion if all of the other dresses of your wife remain as they are and you only used the dress your wife specifically wanted to be her daughters then it's fine imo.", "Nah. On the one hand, your gesture was very sweet and I'm sure your daughter looked adorable in the little green dress. On the other hand, you have rendered that dress unusable past that one day. You'd think, for such a sentimental piece, you would want it to live longer than just for one day. Kids notoriously grow out of clothes so quickly. So I understand your mother-in-law's perspective. She would probably prefer to preserve her daughter's stuff for much longer, presumably so that your daughter can have it one day and use it as an adult, when she would have more knowledge about the importance of it all. Right now, she's still just a pooping lump with no real opinion one way or the other. She doesn't know what you trust her in, it could have been a potato sack. NAH, because grief is a terrible thing and I know you're both just trying to hang on to her where you can.", "You didn't do anything wrong.", "NAH just because you're not thinking straight, OP obviously that your wife meant that she wanted me to wear the dress when she was old, not that you destroyed it, even so you did it with good intentions and about her MIL well she is within her right to feel that way since in his eyes you are destroying part of what reminds him of his daughter", "NAH but I'm inclined to agree with you MIL. \n\nNow when your daughter grows up and actually understands the significance of the dress, she will not have an opportunity to wear it and feel close to her mother. She's a baby, it doesn't mean anything to her now.", "Please make sure you add things that deter mold and moths from the closet! I just wanted to add that because I have thought clothing was safe in a closet before only to find that it wasn't.", "NAH. This is obviously difficult and emotional on both sides. I understand why you did what you did, I also understand why her mother is now grieving that she\u2019ll never see her granddaughter in the same dress as her daughter. To you, the material being the same is important to remember your wife now. To her mother, the form being the same is also important to remember her later. It\u2019s hard. I don\u2019t want to judge anyone in this situation, but it is really regrettable that your daughters birthday was ruined because of it. I hope with more time and space the two of you will be able to talk it through. \n\nI do have to wonder how your daughter might feel say 16 years from now when she looks at her mother\u2019s maternity photos and knows she doesn\u2019t have that dress to wear anymore. I completely understand your decision here, because you\u2019re feeling the grief right *now*, but in the long term, your daughter will only be able to wear that dress once and won\u2019t be old enough to remember it. Perhaps in a few years you could ask your daughter if she\u2019d like to repurpose the dress again, maybe incorporating the fabric into a new dress, if she\u2019d like a way to wear it for a special occasion.", "NAH. MIL is grieving in her own way. She will either come to accept your decision or not. It\u2019s not up to you to heal her. If there is any fabric left from the dress, use it to make a pillow or something and give it to her. Might help. \n\nAnd for daughter\u2019s second birthday, when the little dress you made no longer fits her, find her a beautiful doll or teddy bear to wear the dress forever and gift her that. She will always have her mom nearby.", "I would have been inclined to vote N A H except involving the other guests. Why the fuck does family get involved except to deescalate. Whoever jumped into the fray is an AH. NTA.", "NTA. Grief is hard, and it is very unfair and comes in waves, and everyone copes differently. With that said, I do not believe you were an ah and your MIL is slightly entering ah territory for me. As you mentioned, you\u2019ve saved many of your wife\u2019s gowns and clothing that she will be able to wear if she so chooses one day. It was a beautiful tribute to your wife and as time goes on, I can only hope for you and your daughter that your MIL understands and can come to terms with your tribute.", "Wtf. Nta! You did a beautiful thing to honor your wifes wishes and keep her memory in the present instead of past. Its understanding your mil might get emotional but if shed wanted the dress as a special memento she could have asked. Turning your daughters birthday into a spectacle is unforgivable. She honestly sounds more like an attention seeker than a grieving mother.", "Sorry for your loss. Keep doing what youre doing and dont doubt yourself.  That was a beautiful tribute to your wife and gift to your child", "NTA \n\nI think what you did was very sweet.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s about the dress, I think maybe your mother in law still has a lot of grief and anger over her daughters death and as this birthday is also the anniversary of that death she was feeling rare anyway and it all spilt over onto you,", "OP if you have remaining scraps of the dress use them to make a stuffed toy. If you know your wife's favorite animal it could be additional touch to see to make it in that shape. \n\nOther clothes probably would be better off repurposed as well. It does no good for memory for textile it's attached to be eaten by moths and grow fragile with time.", "NTA! I think that is one of the more beautiful things I have ever heard. What a wonderful way of including your wife on your daughter\u2019s first birthday. I don\u2019t think your mother in law is TA either. She is just still dealing with her grief and lashed out.", "You did nothing wrong.  MIL is acting out of grief NAH", "NAH\n\nIt is one dress of many.  She has other dresses that you maintained for when the daughter is older.\n\nEveryone there is still in grief.  The 1st birthday and the 1st anniversary of passing - it was a hard day for everyone involved.", "No honey, NTA!! I'm so sorry for your loss. I think you did a wonderful thing for your daughter by making that little dress for her! You honored your wife's wish for that dress!\n\n Your mil is way off base here, as well as all the other people who left the party.", "NTA. \nI feel your MIL is setting up an unhealthy dynamic where she sees your little girl as a part of a shrine to her mum rather than a person in her own right. \n\nShe also ruined what was supposed to be a celebration of your babies first year and upset a grieving husband. Her grief does not give her a free pass to do this. \n\nPersonally I would forgive in the sense that I would allow her to repair the relationship with yourself and your daughter (as much as possible) when she is ready but I would not forget and I would not be inviting her to another birthday celebration. I would also not be inviting any of those who chose to escalate the conflict.\n\nEdit for typo", "NTA.  It is a beautiful tribute to your wife and daughter.", "NAH\n\nEmotions were running high on both sides. You possibly could have mentioned it to your mil tho, just to lessen that gut sucker-punch she probably felt.\n\nI doubt your daughter would have wanted to wear it as her own maternity dress anyways, even if the dress did fit, considering her mum died in childbirth. I\u2019d be linking some pretty negative energy to it in all honesty.\n\nIm sorry for your loss but you did something amazing for your little girl, even in the run up to such a seesaw of a milestone. You may want to think about securing the rest of your wife\u2019s belongings tho, especially any sentimental clothing, Incase your mil decides to \u2018save\u2019 them herself.", "NAH. I imagine her mother is feeling, even if she doesn\u2019t know it, like your daughter took her daughter from her in a way. This may have been triggering for her. \n\nYou are raising a baby by yourself. You did something beautiful for her. You made no missteps.", "NAH\n\nI'm sure your wife meant when she was older. However I can see both sides of this. You're both grieving. Neither of you did anything wrong.", "NAH\n\nYour MIL was hurt by any change in her plans for her daughter. It just poked the wound. It can take something really small to reactivate fresh grief in something like this. \n\nIt sounds like she expressed her hurt and then left. That's okay. Leave her alone until she reaches out. You can say you're sorry you didn't think to tell her in advance, and that it must have been a shock. \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong, but she didn't either, unless it was to be a little unaware of how her grief is affecting her judgement.", "NTA and it is nobody's decision.  Everyone is still understandably grieving, but they were out of line.", "NTA it was a beautiful and thoughtful gesture. One never know what the future may bring and the fact that you didn't wait for that dress to maybe be used by her when she grew up but decided to repurpose it for your daughter now is incredibly valuable.  \n\nI am so sorry for your loss and continue to be an amazing dad for your daughter.  \n\nAlso, never doubt you fulfilled your wife's wishes to the letter. If I understand correctly, you repurposed yourself from things you learned from her sewing skills and used that to have your daughter wear her dress. I'm sure she'd be insanely proud.", "NTA\n\nYour wife's possessions became yours to do with as you choose. Even once your daughter grows, there's no guarantee she would be a similar size to her mother, and no guarantee she will have children, either. I suppose it could have become a prom dress instead, but I still feel like this was a lovely way to honor your wife. There must be additional fabric left, so perhaps it can be turned into other things as well. Hair bows can span many ages, perhaps it could be the birthday tradition to have her wear a bow made from her mother's dress after this?", "NTA. That was a beautiful way to honor and include your late wife. You absolutely did nothing wrong and while you MIL is still grieving, as are you, she ruined your daughter\u2019s day by focusing on her grief over everyone else\u2019s.", "Absolutely NTA. Her husband and daughter are her next of kin and get to decide how her wishes  for them are fulfilled. Yes ofc MIL is grieving too,  but to leave her own granddaughter\u2019s birthday party and to fight with you on such an emotional day over this is an AH move. If the dress was that important to her she had a whole year to request it! It sounds like she is just channelling her feelings into a ridiculous argument as she doesn\u2019t know how else to release them. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry for all of your loss, and your idea to put the baby in the gown your wife wore for the maternity shoot is a beautiful tribute to when the 3 of you were together. MIL needs understand that she is not the only person who has suffered the loss, and if she wants to be part of her granddaughter\u2019s life then she needs to respect her father and respect her daughters memory together.", "NTA and I don't think MIL is either. I think she's most likely having a hard time with the grieving process. Family members hopping in and taking sides are AHs in that situation though.", "NTA. And the dead don\u2019t care about the belongings they\u2019ve left behind. They\u2019re never going to use them again.

If it was a wedding dress you'd definitely one but this was a maternity dress and as your daughter gets older and learns why her mother isn't around there's a good chance she'll opt out of going through a pregnancy herself and then she'd never wear the dress this way you got to make it into a special dress to celebrate the milestone she did make it to and you have enough materials left over for prom or something.", "NTA.\n\nThat was a beautiful thing to do. There are still other dresses that the child can wear like the wedding dress, that is if the child wants to. There is no guarantee that once grown up, the child will even like the style of the dresses enough to use or wear them. At least, OP has already honored his late wife's wishes and has made beautiful memories that the child can look back on. \n\nMIL is grieving. And like I always say, I will not even wish the death of a child on my worst enemy. The pain is not only immense but inexplicable. But involving others in the matter was completely uncalled for.

You cannot afford to have her tainting your daughter's life events with her grief and / or bitterness. Life does go on, especially when you have a little one to raise.", "I'm sorry about your loss. That was the sweetest thing you did for your daughter. It's not like you put the dress on some other woman. Your  MIL was really  out of line, and so were the other people who sided with her. Maybe instead of trying to keep reaching out to the negative people in your life, you can focus on the positive. You have a daughter to raise and healing to do at the same time. I'm so glad your baby survived. I wish you all the best.", "NTA. Grief can cause strife among family, I hope with time your MIL will heal enough to realize her reaction was wrong. I have so much empathy for you both because of this difficult situation. With time your MIL will hopefully see that what you did was a tribute of love.", "NTA. Your grief is deeper than anyone else's, and you're dealing with it in a healthy way, honoring your wife while still moving forward. I'm sorry your MIL doesn't understand.", "NTA. Your MIL ruined her daughter's first birthday over something that wasn't her business.

I think it is an awesome way to make a connection between your daughter and your wife. \n\nA lot of people talk about wanting their daughters to wear their dresses, etc. but fashion changes a lot over 20+ years, so there is a reasonable expectation that your daughter might not even like the dress when she is old enough to wear it and may wear it out of obligation to you for a memory of your wife that she will never have and not because she actually loves the dress. I think that making her the dress now is more impactful because that will be something she shares with you and she can look back on it as one of her cherished baby items.\n\nWhile you and your MIL have lots of beautiful memories of your wife, your daughter will never know her that way. I wouldn't worry too much about your MIL, she is just hurting because it is a reminder that her daughter is gone on the anniversary of her passing. She just needs some space.", "NTA.  That's a wonderful way to remember your wife.  All the relatives' opinions are unimportant because repurposing the dress was very meaningful to you!  I'm not sure why your MIL was so upset about it since you said other nice clothes are all intact.  Everyone will remember your wife in different ways and this was important to you - make sure you get some good pics of your daughter wearing it, because the pics of her in the dress and the pics of your wife in the dress are going to be something your daughter may want to see when she's older.", "This is such a beautiful idea  and I can\u2019t imagine your sorrow I cannot imagine. After all you\u2019ve been through. How can anyone criticize this? It\u2019s heartbreaking. This dress could be passed down for generations with the story of this devoted father, grandfather great grandfather. Or she could dress her favorite doll in it. \n\nMy children cherish some of the things my mom made for them. And there\u2019s no story behind it like this. \n\nYou are a prince of a fellow. That\u2019s all. I\u2019m so sorry and I hope and pray for you and your daughter for a happy peaceful life.", "NTA \n\nEveryone is still raw from an unbelievable loss. I suspect given a little time she will come around. She lost her daughter and she is stuck in mom mode where she made the decisions about her daughter. She is wrong but I would cut her a little slack on this one and give her a little time to calm down and process it. Then when you have made amends perhaps you could offer her a few articles of clothing. The wedding dress needs to be preserved for your daughter to decide what she wants to do with it but some of the other items can be given to her mom. It takes years to get to the point where you are ready to let go of things. I think your idea to make your daughter a dress was fantastic especially because your wife wore it while pregnant with your daughter.", "This made me tear up, because it is such a beautiful tribute to your late wife (may her memory be a blessing.)

I sympathize with MIL, because she\u2019s grieving her daughter. But what if your daughter doesn\u2019t want or can\u2019t have children? She might never have occasion to wear the full dress. Like you said, you fulfilled wife\u2019s wish just probably about 20 years earlier than expected.", "The dress you made can be preserved for when and if your daughter gives birth to a girl in the future. It'll be easier to put that dress on the baby in the future than to try to get a grown woman to wear that as a wedding dress. You won't know her taste or body type. She might not even want to get married. MIL is grieving, but so are you. Her daughter left a gift behind that she should want to  help you raise in her honor.", "Unfortunately emotions are all over the place for the both of you on this first anniversary of your wife/her daughter's death. \n\nGive her space and time and hopefully the relationship doesn't have to go sour.", "NTA at ALL! So sorry for your loss and I bet more than anything it was jarring for the MIL to see the dress when she wasn\u2019t expecting it and the memories it evoked. She probably wasn\u2019t prepared for that but her response is disgusting. What you did was thoughtful, honoring to your late wife and 100% the right thing to do! Save the photos and write out a memory of the thought befhind it for her to savor later! You are such a good dad and if MIL is going to act like that she\u2019s not invited next time! Follow your gut on parenting!!", "NTA. 1. The dress belongs to you now. Anything that your wife owned that she didn\u2019t leave to someone else  you have a right to do with as you please. 2. If she cared so much about the dress or any of the possessions she\u2019s had a year to ask for anything sentimental. 3. Are maternity shoot dresses even that important out of all the outfits that can be worn? I\u2019ve never heard anyone claim they were really special so it makes me feel like she\u2019d have had a problem regarding what piece of clothing you used. \n\nEveryone who left should be sent a message about how they ruined your daughters day. This was supposed to be a happy occasion and instead they ruined it by arguing about a dress that no one has worn in a year and that nobody has asked for in that same amount of time. Yes your mother in law is allowed to grieve, many of us will probably never know what it\u2019s like to be a single mother to an only child and then lose said child but her grief doesn\u2019t outrank anyone\u2019s. Her grief doesn\u2019t make her opinion law. She was t the only one who loved her daughter.", "NTA\n\nIt was a raw moment for MIL, being a death-day and birthday on the same day.

It is so terrible that what is typically a joyful time was so tinged with grief for each of you. \n\nOP, you did nothing wrong. You were honoring your wife\u2019s intent.

But I also give your MIL a very very soft YTA.  Grief makes us do funny things and search out unexpected outlets.", "NTA. What a great way of honoring you wife and daugnters mother on such a big day. \n\nI get that it is probably hard for your MIL, but you can't preserve everything in perfect condition forever, and it is up to you to find out what to save, what not to save and to make it into new things that can make new memories for you all.", "NTA. You honored your late wife and did something extraordinary for your daughter. Yes, emotions were undoubtedly high with it being your daughter's birthday, and the anniversary of your wife's passing, but it doesn't excuse your MIL's behavior.

Best to you and your daughter.", "NTA I understand your mother in law and is grieving and this was absolutely your call to make.\nNo matter what she was feeling, this was neither the time nor the place to bring it up.\nIt should never have escalated.\nI am so sorry you experienced that", "NTA. But with a bit of a disclaimer about your mother in law grieving. It was an entirely appropriate thing to do. You haven't ruined any memory, if your MIL feels that way then she ruined the memory for herself. And her logic of maybe seeing your daughter wearing the dress as an adult is foolish. Maybe it was what your wife meant but expecting you to keep the dress safe for decades just hoping it will fit is silly. \n\nMothers (and fathers too for that matter) can get this idea they know their kids better than anyone. And for much of their life it's true. Then they become adults, they change and spend their lives more and more with someone else. At the end I'm certain you knew your wife better than her mother. And with that knowledge you made a thoughtful tribute. It's understandable your MIL is upset and part of her will always grieve. But that doesn't mean you were wrong. I wouldn't apologise to her, but I would certainly empathise and say I understood she was hurt and that it wasn't the intention. But your decision was based on what you felt was suitable and in line with your understanding of what your wife would have wanted.", "NTA.  You did what you thought was right to fulfill your wife's wishes.  Her mother is understandably upset about the death and this is a place she can put her grief.", "NTA. Just because your wife could fit the dress doesn\u2019t mean adult daughter could. My mom saved a dress from her young adult years that I was never able to zip up. I am not saving dresses for my daughter because even at 10 I know she will be much slimmer than me. Saving clothes for others rarely works out as planned.", "NTA Obviously MIL has some unresolved anger issues regarding OP\u2019s wife\u2019s passing. Totally understandable but she\u2019s definitely misdirecting it towards OP.\n\nIt might be that she blames OP and the baby for the tragic loss of her daughter in some way and hasn\u2019t processed her feelings; one year may not be enough. \n\nShe might feel guilt about these feelings and trying to celebrate her granddaughter\u2019s first birthday put her in a weird place mentally/emotionally. Not to say I condone how she handled herself, which was really awful, but I think she\u2019s still struggling with the loss.\n\nOP had the \u201cadvantage\u201d of knowing his wife\u2019s wishes and of being able to find a way to move forward in his grief by creating this special dress for his daughter. I think that MIL was blindsided and felt that OP was able to \u201creplace\u201d his wife while MIL still feels the void of her daughter\u2019s absence. If OP had mentioned his plans for the dress to MIL, this may have gone differently. \n\nThis is just an awful situation where no one should be called an Ahole but it is understandable that MIL acted like one as OP has presented it. I just hope they will all get through this and find peace for the sake of the baby.", "NTA...I don't know any man who would do such a beautiful thing. Give your MIL the benefit of the doubt. She's still hurting too. Your daughter is a lucky girl!", "NTA. This was a lovely tribute and your MIL needs to let you make decisions about your wife\u2019s things. I now she\u2019s grieving, but so are you. She can\u2019t rightfully say what your wife would\u2019ve wanted in this kind of unprecedented situation. \n\nPerhaps when you are ready to tidy up some of your wife\u2019s things, because there will come a time where you\u2019re going to start making decisions about getting rid of stuff, give your MIL the chance to go through the stuff and pick out items she\u2019d like to keep before getting rid of anything. Hopefully, that will cut down on issues in dealing with her.", "NTA Not only is that a dress she wore specifically with her baby in mind, making it the prefect thing to give to her baby now.  Who knows what might happen to any of your wife's clothes between now and when your daughter is grown.", "NTA. I'm so sorry for your loss. People grieve in different ways. There is nothing wrong with what you chose to do with the gown. But also, I understand how and why it would stir up feelings in your MIL. It would have been better if she could have had the grace to see your side, but, in that moment, she didn't or couldn't.\n\nIt is hard to react rationally to the loss of a child. In this situation, without leaning *too* much into psychology, it seems to me that her reaction wasn't truly about the dress, but about the loss of her daughter. This is just a guess on my part, but she may, subconsciously and irrationally, blame you for the loss of her daughter. The dress, being a maternity dress, is especially pointed. I say this not because I think you are to blame \u2014 you aren't \u2014 but because it may help to understand the scale of her feelings over a thing that, to be honest, doesn't matter. The dress itself may have been forgotten, or damaged if you had set it aside. I think this is more about  having a place to put all of the feelings of sorrow, rage and loss that your MIL may not be able to otherwise express. (I imagine you share many of these feelings too.)\n\nYou can only control your part in this, and that can mean giving her the grace she could not give you. Let her be upset and also let her know you want her to be part of her granddaughter's, which I think will be more important to all of you in the long run.", "NTA. I thought what you did was a beautiful gesture. I don't think your MIL is an AH either. This is a grief she'll never get over. Grace is appropriate in this case especially for yourself.", "NTA.

Her mother is grieving and still can\u2019t bear to let any surviving piece of her daughter go. \n\nNo one here is an asshole, and in time your mother in law will come to see that. Since she is avoiding calls try to send a card to your mother in law saying that you\u2019re sorry you didn\u2019t warn her and that you can see how she\u2019d be shocked and hurt that you didn\u2019t tell her you\u2019d done this ahead of time. Let her know that you want her to be a part of your daughter\u2019s life and to help you tell her about her mother so that she grows up knowing about who her mom was. Let her know you did what you think was best and you understand she feels differently but that you don\u2019t think either is wrong. You wanted her daughter to be a part of your daughter\u2019s special day and that was your way. Let her know that you will save some items for when your daughter is older and invite her to help you pick some to save. \n\nContinue this as a tradition as your daughter gets older, and in time let her pick which item she wants to use for special occasions. Then save the dresses, shirts, and frocks you make from your late wife\u2019s clothing and create a hope chest of the things you gave your daughter that were once her mother\u2019s.\n\nShare the chest with her and take pictures of the before and after, and as she grows and learns how to stitch the change, so that you can show her this is what your mother had and this is how it was changed for her. These pictures will become a treasure. \n\nSave the wedding dress and even if she picks something else on her wedding day, she can choose to display the dress or take a part of her mother\u2019s to incorporate into her dress if she wants so her mom is there. \n\nKeep being an awesome dad and teach the stitching to your daughter to keep her mom a part of her life.", "NTA\n\nYour MIL is grieving, but she's incorrect about the memory no longer existing after you altered the dress down. Repurposing the dress doesn't make everyone forget it was the dress from the maternity shoot. Your MIL probably meant that the anticipated scene of her granddaughter wearing the dress as an adult is now unlikely to happen, but that's still not necessarily true. Depending on how much material is left, you may still be able to have the primary garment fashioned into something your daughter can wear as an adult/when she's fully grown. Baby clothes don't use that much material, unless it's thrown out there's probably a LOT of fabric left over to make a longer lasting keepsake for your daughter. You may even be able to match a matching item for your daughter and her grandmother, like purses or something that they can each have one of.", "NTA  Your MIL is grieving & being unreasonable.  Just because she wants it all preserved intact doesn't mean that's what you have to do or even what your DD will want.  I think what you did was beautiful.", "NTA grief doesn\u2019t always make sense and I am sure she is just reacting emotionally but trying to give it a reason. You keep doing what your doing. Your MIL needs to understand your lost your wife and your daughter lost her mom. You get to decide how to grieve and honour your wife. You know best in this situation and although your MIL probably wasn\u2019t trying to hurt you, it seems like she is playing who knows your wife best.

If she could have taken 5 seconds to actually think, it would have occurred to her that her daughter's blood runs through her granddaughter's veins.  And that making her granddaughter's day special would have been one way to continue to bond with the daughter she lost.

She\u2019s clearly not dealing with her grief very well (which is perfectly normal though sad). IMO, keeping clothes for sentimental value can be nice, but keeping every single item a person left behind exactly as they left it is not healthy and will prevent folks from growing. She seems to think tangible things ARE the memories, but they aren\u2019t. She thinks if she can keep everything her daughter left behind exactly as it was, then it\u2019ll feel like she never passed and can just pick up those things and live the life she lost. Being a mother who lost a child must be so devastating and confusing because, you\u2019re not the next of kin anymore. You don\u2019t get to make decisions anymore, everything will feel out of your control (though clearly it is for everyone, parents fulfilled a place of care for their child\u2019s entire lives and now they can\u2019t care for them anymore). The grieving process is long and complicated and different for everyone, which is why I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth forgiving her, but what you did was a beautiful tribute to your wife, and a beautiful gift to your daughter. You are actively trying to have your wife as a part of your daughter\u2019s life, and keep her close. Your MIL should not have said what she said, but grief has no logic to it sometimes.

You created a beautiful tribute but make certain you don't alter many of her clothes so that your daughter can decide when she's old enough.", "NTA at all..You did a beautiful thing and I'm sure your wife is watching from heaven, absolutely thrilled to see her baby girl wear her dress. I have a 6 month old and I'm sitting here balling my eyes out at the mere thought. You did a lovely thing. MIL is just grieving. I would like to think she will eventually come around. I know it's hard, bit try be kind when she does. Grief does weird things to us. She doesn't know what to feel. She probably felt the devastation of losing her all over again, in that moment. I'm sorry they caused you so much anguish. I hope you guys all find some peace. I can only imagine the pain you've all carried the past year. Sending you patience and courage from far away. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA - your MIL is grieving, people grieving are not always rational. You honored your wife's wish with an otherwise not significant dress. It's not like you cut up her wedding dress (save that for your daughter's wedding one day). You did a beautiful thing, your MIL is just not in a mental state to be happy.", "NAH. All of you are still grieving and the 1 year anniversary is the hardest. For you the dress for your daughter provides some closure. For others it made the loss the highlight. Sorry for all of you. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\nYou knew your wife best and her wishes. Everyone else can go away.\n\nHave a hug from a fellow dad.", "Im so sorry OP for what you are going through. You are NTA in the slightest. As a momma I would hope my husband would do the same with my old fire uniform for my son. Your daughter and you will have this memory. Down the line if she so decides to have kiddos pass the outfit along. This could be a very special thing that passes down through family. I can understand it  bringing up feelings for MIL but her response is uncalled for. Shes projecting emotions. As a momma i know your wife would have loved this idea. You have so many other pieces for her down the line. You can even keep the scraps for her to use in future for something. Dont let MIL and family make you feel bad for this. You're a great dad. Im sending all the good vibes and hugs your way OP.", "NTA at all, but...if I do have bio-kids, you've given me the perfect tradition I wanna start. That's beautiful!!\n\nThe only thought I have is if your daughter might be upset later-- this was the dress most connected to her mom because of what her mom said, and she might be sad not getting to use it as intended when she would probably really love a connection to her mom. Is there enough dress left over to make something else for her as a grown up preparing for her first child? Maybe a blanket or something? (Might be the perfect project for her Mom's baby shower dress?) Just something she can hold as an older teen/adult that's really special.", "NTA but ur MIL isnt the asshole either. You both are just grieving and have different point of view. I can see both sides of the story, this is a hard situation for the both of you.\n\nMaybe call her and just apologize and mend the situation, its a hard time for the both of you, your MIL just lost a daughter so im sure she wants to preserve everything that once belongs to her. You lost your wife, and you are trying to remember her and fulfill her wishes the best you can.", "NTA. My heart breaks for you! I think that using your wife's dress like that was a beautiful gesture. Please don't feel bad for doing what you did. \n\nYour MIL was way out of line! I can cut her some slack because she's grieving, and your daughter's birthday is going to be a source of pain for her, but she was cruel to you. Might I suggest that you remain Low or No contact for a while until cooler heads prevail?", "NTA, and it\u2019s a lovely idea. I think it\u2019s great that you\u2019re bringing these memories of her mother into her life from the beginning, rather than saving so many for adulthood - it\u2019s like she\u2019s always there, just a little.", "NTA. Does the MIL really think that your daughter will wear it, someday, long in three future, IF she becomes pregnant? I think the frock was a fitting tribute.", "Am I the only one who kinda sees the mother's point?\n\nLike I get altering the dress...but for a 1 year old? You've reduced the fabric significantly...and for a 1 time use? And a time she won't even actually remember? I can see why the mother would be shocked and upset...", "NTA. It was a maternity photoshoot dress, that is not the kind of thing people preserve as a cherished memory, the photos are there for that. But cut MIL some slack, losing a child is difficult and she doesn't seem to be handling it well.", "NTA. And cut MIL off for a bit....she'll come begging back. Make a different family for yourself.", "You are NTA!!!!\n\nWhat you did was perfect and a beautiful way to remember and honor your wife on your sweet baby girl's first birthday.\n\nYour wife is smiling and proud. Good job, dad! \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA.", "NTA.  This was a beautiful tribute.  If it had been a wedding dress, I could understand your MIL being upset.  But having your daughter in it on her first birthday, and having those photos and your wife\u2019s tribute to her, and your tribute to your wife all wrapped up in one moment is thoughtful.", "NTA, mister. Things are just that; things. If this was your wife's wish (and it's a lovely one, great job on pulling it off. I'm all thumbs with sewing! ), then you did the right thing. MIL is probably just raw and feeling out of control about the situation and her emotions, which is natural. Is there any way you could make her memento out of the fabric of the gown for her to keep?", "So the other adults left a 1 yr old's bday celebration in huff over her dress? I really hope the child was too young to pick up on all that. Ugh. NTA.", "NTA. Maternity dresses aren't really things passed down.\nConsidering your wife loved to sew she may have envisioned exactly what you did.\nI honestly now wish I would've had my maternity dress for photos made into a dress for my daughters 1st birthday. So special and sweet. When you're daughter is older she will want to pick her own maternity dress most likely.\n\nYour MIL is grieving yes but starting an argument and gathering others on a super difficult day was in appropriate. You are an awesome dad!", "NAH. I can understand both viewpoints. Sorry for your loss. Happy Birthday to your little one.", "Nta putting the emotional attachment asside your daughter might not even had liked the style of the dress when she grew up and even then who knows if she would even want children when she grows up. You gave a new purpose to the dress. And if she decides to have a daughter in the future they can wear grandma's dress. There are plenty of clothes to give your child as she gets older. Honestly, if you have the space, I'd vaccuum seal all of them and save them til she can wear them, and then you can let her decide what she wants to keep and wear for herself.\n\n(And as an unrelated side note, if and/or when you feel ready to be another relationship, keep in mind you're not looking for just for yourself. I've seen a lot of posts on here where the stepmother sours the family dynamic. Sometimes it's because they reject the child and try to push them from the family and others it's because the stepmother pushes too hard on the child to acknowledge them as a parent when they don't want to. You seem like a good father. I trust you'll make good judgements.)", "NTA.  You did an amazing thing. From one dad to another, you did it right man.", "Jesus Christ there can be no judgment here other than NAH, I\u2019m so sorry you are going through this. I\u2019m so sorry for you MIL too - just gut wrenching. \n\nI will tentatively say that one day most of those clothes of you late wife will have to go somewhere and I want to very very gently say to your MIL she might need to prepare herself for that.", "As a person who sews, I would love it if my clothes were cut up and sewn back up for my daughter or family.", "Your mother in law is the asshole. Carry on doing what you are doing. You are a beautiful father. Good on you", "NTA.\nI think what you did was beautiful and meaningful and your daughter will some day be very grateful for this, and probably use this dress on her future daughter.\nAs you referred, there are other important gowns you preserved that your daughter may someday use and you did not destroy your wife\u2019s dress, you gave it a new purpose and honored her memory.", "You AND your mother in law are NTA, you're both experiencing grief in your own ways. Hopefully you can reconnect following this and understand that Yiu both are doing your best to honour your late wife's memory.\n\nThe guests seem to be the assholes in this one, unless there were any that were actually trying to de-escalate the situation.", "Hey OP, you get to choose what\u2019s best for your own child. You created a memory for her and yourself, so you managed to go through your grieving process the most grandest way possible by doing what an amazing dad could do. Please don\u2019t take it personally as your MIL clearly is very hurt in terms of losing her daughter. You\u2019re clearly NTA. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss and I wish you nothing but love and warmth to the both of you. \n\nOh and take a bunch of pictures of your daughter in that amazing dress you created because you\u2019ll have this beautiful story to tell her once she gets older. I\u2019ve been going through a lot of old pictures of friends and family recently and the feeling of those memories you create from the past become core memories. Good luck OP \ud83d\udc95", "Hmm im not sure its a difficult one. You're not an asshole but for the sake of voting YTA. Your daughter cant cherish that dress as a baby, she would have been able to cherish it as an adult for many years though", "I can see her point, but it was not her decision, and you are not psychic. As I get older, I sometimes get upset and I cannot hide it even if I know I should. Even if I try really hard. \n\nWhat a difficult day.  My heart goes out to both of you.\n\nLet the dead bury the dead.  What's done is done and you must move on. I am sure if you had known how upset she would be you would have done things differently, even if only giving her a heads up so she wasn't caught off guard. Let her know that. I wish you could come together and do something special to make a substitute memory.  And if there are some more remnants, is there a way you can incorporate them into a keepsake for her? A peace offering, unless that would trigger her.\n\nSo very NTA.", "NTA- your MIL over-stepped. I'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA.\n\nConsider the alternative \u201cplan\u201d of your daughter wearing it as her own maternity gown in the future. There is no guarantee she will ever be pregnant herself, and if she does she may want to chose her own gown at that point and not be pressured into wearing this one.\n\nThis was a good way of passing it to her while you can still appropriately make that kind of decision for her and draw a connection to her as a baby to her pregnant mother. Probably the best possible plan.", "Nta, not only did you honor your wife, YOU MADE the dress as taught by your wife, I can\u2019t imagine your grief and love as you did it.  ((((Hugs)))) all the best to you and your daughter.", "Hopping on to say thay OP should change their locks. This type of behavior usually leads to escalation and I wouldn't want MIL pr anyone else to think they have a right to take OPs late wife's things. \n\nIt's so sad so many people left a one year olds birthday party. I'm so sorry OP.", "Completely agree, but I do think OP should cut MIL some slack on this and give her a few days. Yes, it is his daughters first birthday, but it's also the anniversary of the death of OP's wife and MIL's only daughter. That can be a lot to work through and you can not really prepare for it.", "OP not only are you NTA, but that is one of the most beautiful ways to repurpose a dress I've ever heard. It will be so meaningful for your daughter too when she is older, a special connection to the mother she never knew.", "The dress was meant for the daughter when it would fit her, when she was older and could treasure the dress that was her mother's, not to be destroyed so you could put it on a baby. You are so wrong.", "Also people keep saying \"maternity dress\" like that's a thing. Some massive tradition that people pass down generation to generation.\n\nThis is some random dress she wore one time in some photos. She probably wore a hundred things while pregnant. The fact that she wore it in those photos making it \"special\" also means it was well documented. She's got 100 other items of clothing that have more memories in them. She'll have tshirts more special than this dress, because that Tshirt she loved and wore often is way more \"of her\" than a dress she slayed in a couple hours one day.\n\nBut even in terms of one day dresses \"maternity dress\" isn't a thing. If OP cut up her wedding dress to make a smock the child will fit into for 5 minutes, that might be different.", "You make a valid point about the anniversary of her passing. Here I was thinking that recognizing the dress just caught her off guard but you are absolutely right...I didn't even connect the two events.....that adds a whole other layer to the grieving family.", "My thoughts exactly. MIL is dealing with the anniversary of that loss and got hit with a probably a pretty big shock she wasn\u2019t expecting.", "I wouldn't say that, MIL took it too far the moment she involved other guests, that's vile. She's horrible for that. Grieving is one thing but she's still vile for involving other people, she did it with malicious intent\n\nNTA", "What about the literal pile of the mom's clothes that daughter can still wear?", "True, but it was a maternity dress. That's several steps away from a wedding dress and not far from casual. If she's getting this worked up over a maternity dress she could easily get triggered by anything remotely nice that she had once worn. MIL needs to regulate her emotions and not blame others for making her feel them.", "But MIL reacted selfishly. It\u2019s one thing to be upset and to discuss it later (what she should have done), but it\u2019s another to throw a big fit to where others put there views on it, then leave along with most of the guests. This was her granddaughter\u2019s birthday party. She should have sucked it up and stayed.", "I dont think she chose to. I think it was the first anniversary of the death of her only child and the dress was a shock. \n\nIf op wasn't also grieving he may have considered this but he didn't and that's understandable. \n\nNAH", "I don't think the mum's an arsehole though.", "Understandably given the shock and situation. I can't call either of these people asshole", "It could have been anticipated. It wasn't and that's not unexpected either. No assholes", "The likelihood of his daughter keeping a *maternity dress* that will be in all likelihood at least 20-30 years out of fashion her whole adult life is pretty vanishingly small. \n\nThe tiny dress can also be kept, maybe put on a special bear or doll. \n\nThe original fabric can also be repurposed if only a one-year-old-size dress has been taken from it.", "But who\u2019s to say the daughter would have the same body type? I think it\u2019s a great idea. Instead of waiting 20 years she can have that connection now. And they can save the dress for her future daughter", "It makes perfect sense. The entire ordeal was hard on the family,  especially her mother, his wife's mother, his MIL.  \nWhy was it hard to understand?", ">That said, MIL probably needs counseling because she probably resents your daughter for your wife's passing\n\nThat's a fucking leap and a half, Jesus. Did you stop to think that perhaps the anniversary of her daughters death might bring some complicated feelings? Do we really have to go straight to \"she resents her granddaughter for killing her daughter\"??\n\nAlso, there's no clock on grief. Maybe she is seeing a counselor, maybe she can't afford the hundreds of dollars a session to see a counselor? How the fuck do you know?\n\nFucking armchair psychologist up here.", "Hi, so after my wife's death, her side of the closet was left completely untouched. Even the door wasn't opened anytime because she had closed it, and I didn't want to disturb that. Her mother too visited us from time to time, but like me, she too avoided the spots that reminded her of her daughter too much. Especially her closet.\nIt was only when I thought of this repurposing idea that I went and opened the door in a long time. The dress was hung up like she had left it after that photo shoot. I will do as you suggested and put the rest of her things in a box when I get the courage to.\nThank you so much for your kind wishes.", "Also if MIL would have wanted this dress so badly, which may or may not be understandable (even if she isn't entitled to it) she could have communicated that. It's been a year. I'm not saying you can't grieve for years, but if you want belongings of the deceased, you should probably bring that up within a few months. To, you know, prevent them from being trashed/sold/or used as the new owner sees fit.\n\n Come on now.", "I think the line \"it explains her feelings, not her behavior\" is so important. So often we let ourselves or others get away with acting a fool because of feelings when in reality that is seriously inconsiderate and emotionally immature. You don't get to force your feelings on everyone because you're having them.", "Exactly. That may have been her daughter's dress, but she was OP's *wife*. And I think MIL can't get over that OP's relationship and knowledge of her wishes takes primacy over MIL's.", "Since the birthday and death day are the same day, it\u2019s the first anniversary of her only child\u2019s death. I would kind of give her a pass for acting irrational and touch base in a bit when emotions aren\u2019t so raw. First anniversaries are hard.", "Plus... honestly I couldn't wear a maternity dress of my mom's if she passed after giving birth to me. It'd be anxiety inducing and traumatic for me.", "Think about the clothing your parents wore before they had you - there\u2019s 0% chance this dress would be added to OP\u2019s daughter\u2019s regular wardrobe of the future. Fashions change.\n\nAlso good point about having children. Who knows what this child is going to choose to do with her life, it\u2019s a weird, pressurey assumption to keep it for her to wear \u2018when she\u2019s pregnant\u2019. Yick", "Totally agree. What did it for me was MIL saying her death negates what she said. No, it does not. MIL is grieving but has forgotten that OP is grieving too.", "How is everybody overlooking the implication that Dad may have done the conversion work himself?\n\nBecause that would be super awesome.", "NAH. Let's ignore MIL for a moment. If wife were alive, she might be posting AITA for being upset that my husband cut up a dress I wanted my daughter to wear when she was old enough to fit into it?\n\nIt's very doubtful this is what wife wanted, but we'll never know. While MIL was upset to see a dress meant for her own daughter who was supposed to still be here, she is also defending the wishes of her daughter. The fact that daughter is gone doesn't change what \nthose wishes were, actually the fact that someone else made a decision on her behalf makes the fact she is gone more pronounced.\n\nOP is NTA for doing something in his mind to bring mom and daughter together in a way, but nor is MIL for being upset that the dress can no longer be used in the future. It was OP's decision to make, but that doesn't mean it wasn't hurtful to other people. OP may be honoring his wife's wishes but I doubt she meant this.\n\nCould MIL have left instead of expressing her shock and devastation? Yes - but there still would've been drama either way. And in her mind, defending her daughter takes priority and I can't fault her for that. NAH all the way.", "Not to mention she walked in having no idea about the dress. That must have been a fucking gut punch", "Suppose the daughter never wants children, or has fertility issues. Should she not be able to wear the dress until she gets pregnant, because it's specifically a maternity dress? Nit-picking when and how exactly she should be able to have it is pointless. The effort OP put into making a smaller dress makes it a new garment that shows love from both parents, and not just an outfit that may or may not ever fit the child for so many reasons.", "Why? Who is to say that daughter would even want the maternity dress as an adult? This is a v sad situation, but the dude is not \u201cso wrong\u201d for repurposing his deceased wife\u2019s clothing to make a special dress for the little girl who lived.", "What if she wants to wear something else when she\u2019s older and not feel pressured to take photos in her dead Mom\u2019s dress? What if wearing the same dress her mom had worn then died in childbirth is severely anxiety inducing when she is herself pregnant?", "No. This is such an unfair take.", "Ah yes, have her wear the cursed dress. \nNothing says healthy pregnancy vibes like wearing the dress that your mom wore before she died in childbirth.", "This. My mother always wanted one of us to wear her wedding dress. She saved it for 40 years and not one of us ever wore it - different body types, different styles, etc... \n\nThe fact is, styles change and the possibility is quite slim that daughter would be able to or choose to wear that particular dress in the future.\n\nNTA. OP, I love what you did. If there is enough fabric, I'd actually use it to create treasures for her for other keepsake moments - small things she can tuck away and carry with her like maybe another dress for her second birthday (assuming enough fabric), a bow for her 3rd birthday. \n\nAnd, I love the idea of framing the side by side photos of your wife in the dress and daughter at her first birthday. Give it time. The day also commemorates the loss of your MIL's only daughter so emotions were already extremely high. Hopefully within the next week or two she will realize that she was being silly. Her reaction was not about the dress.", "It does. A first birthday is a happy occasion but in this case it is extremely bittersweet because it is the first anniversary of the mother's death, which is an incredibly painful moment. \n\nI am not going to call a woman mourning her only child an asshole for having a bad reaction on the anniversary of her child's dearth but OP is also very much not an asshole.", "This is absolutely beautiful.

But I also don't think she went up to guests and went \"tell him he is an asshole\", I think the argument became heated. \n\nMy guess is if it wasn't the dress it would have been something else because of how emotionally fraught the day was. I bet the last place the MIL wanted to be was a party and maybe she should have stayed home but she also loved her granddaughter and I am sure she wanted to be there. Grief is a very complex thing.\n\nAnd on the anniversary of her daughter's death, she saw a dress that she probably hoped her daughter would wear again (future children) being repurposed and it was a very blatant reminder of the fact that her daughter was gone and I so have some sympathy for her.", "I don't know, I feel Grief is a very nuanced topic. I don't mean to say that \"If you're grieving, you can't be held responsible for your actions\", but anniversaries are notoriously difficult days that are hard to comprehend if you haven't been in that circumstance yourself, as well as it affecting different people in different ways\n\nGiving benefit of the doubt, it reads to me like MIL had a lot of emotions going on, and the first thing out of her control was a straw that broke the camel's back. I feel she was wrong here, certainly, but understandably.

Obviously not the whole dress, you can make a shorter dress either way.", "If the daughter ends up having a baby in 20+ years time then she can use her 1st bd gown for the kid.", "I think it's that the mum and husband had different interpretation of the meaning of the wife's wishes. The mum thought that to honor the wife's wishes the dress would be amongst those that are perfectly preserved so that the daughter could one day wear it as the wife had expressed was her wish. Hearing the husband say that the dress had not been preserved and was just laying forgotten in a closet is hard to hear on the anniversary of the death of your daughter. It doesn't matter that a maternity dress is not commonly thought of a special. The wife had expressed that it was special to her. Especially if it was the one used for the photoshoot. It's not just any maternity dress.   \n    \nFrom the husband's view he sees it as fulfilling her wish. He even used the skills he was taught by her to make it happen. He obviously was not trying to be malicious but he could have at least warned her or tried to include her in the process of making this gesture to celebrate the life of the wife. I personally feel he was over zealous and should have waited for the daughter to fit into the dress so that she could understand the significance and fully participate in the moment too. But if that's his coping mechanism that's fine. He just needs to remember that it's hard for others too and afford them the same grace that is being extended to him.   Nobody here is the AH. The situation is the AH.", "> MIL needs to regulate her emotions and not blame others for making her feel them.\n\nReally? Or how about MIL is clearly still grieving, and that takes exactly as long as it take? You don't get to rush grief, unfortunately. \n\nYes, she overreacted. I'd like to see how you handle your only grandchilds first birthday being the first anniversary of the death of your own daughter! She needs to come to terms with the fact that she will be confronted with these feelings every single year for the rest of her life. That's fucking hard, and who the fuck are we to judge?\n\nYou're response is incredibly glib, and I'm sorry we aren't all perfect specimens of humans, completely under control at all times.

Have you *ever* been around a child? Even early elementary schoolers talk about sentimental value from things from deceased people they know. Preschoolers whose parents are deployed understand the sentimental value of their parent\u2019s jacket or something in their absence. Missing people and finding comfort in memories you\u2019ve made or times you were brought close to them is not a concept that suddenly emerges in middle or high school.

Hopefully the MIL turns out to find it sentimental later on in life aswell.", "LO might understand that there is anger and resentment directed at her.

The only time she\u2019ll be able to wear it is when she is pregnant. So that\u2019s presumably about 20+ years away. Dad is supposed to preserve and store the dress for the next couple to several decades, as well as all the other dresses for events that are regarded as actual cultural tradition (wedding, baby shower, etc) without any regard to the grief that brings him? And even if he does that, he\u2019s supposed to be all gung ho and not have any complicated feelings about her wearing it to a maternity shoot? In my personal opinion, it seems like it would be a lot more triggering in that context, considering the daughter would be so close to the circumstances that literally killed her mother.

Next time, instead of asking a bunch of strangers with NO medical backgrounds to give you opinions on grief, talk to your therapist.\n\nThis situation is firmly in the ESH category. Period. You and you mother in law are in the throes of grief. Instead of waiting for the appropriate time and moment to gift your daughter an ADULT dress, you ruined the dress. You did this with the intention of feeling close to your wife and to have the same for your daughter. But your daughter is an infant. She does not feel her mothers presence by wearing that dress. She literally can't. She is a baby. And the fact is, you ADMITTED to having your wife's baby clothes. You should have dressed your daughter in age appropriate clothes, especially since you had them. \n\nInstead, completely understandably, you latched onto what your wife said about wanting to see her daughter in this dress. So you took an item with EXTREME sentimental value and cut it up and made it disappear. Of course your mother in law would be upset and have a negative reaction. Not to be an ass, but her grief is so much worse than yours, and you need to have some empathy for that. She just lost a child of near 40 years. And then to have someone DESTROY a SAVED artifact is heartbreaking and devastating. In that moment, you were killing her daughters memory by destroying her things. Even if it was to create a dress for her daughter.\n\nPlease, please, please, apologize to your mother in law. Not because you're the AH, but because both of you are suffering in different ways and are handling it differently. Tell her you never meant to ruin a gown for your wife and that you got carried away with the need to feel as if she was still alive and part of your life in some way. In a way, you needed to see that dress on your daughter. Life is short. I'm sure you're afraid of your own mortality after what you experienced. But it doesn't negate the fact you took an item from a shrine, that had age appropriate alternatives, and you destroyed it. Its only use now is as a baby dress that can never be used again, and will never hold any special significance to your daughter because she cannot remember it.", "Nah. But perhaps wait to cut anything up until your daughter can actually remember wearing the stuff. You're taking away opportunities for your daughter to be old enough and aware enough to learn about her mother, and the memories behind a certain thing or outfit.

I am happy that you have saved her special dresses & hope some day your daughter may make use of some of them, especially the wedding dress in some way.

She probably didn't ask about it because she thought you were keeping it for the future. If you told her you wanted to make space, I'm sure she gladly would have kept it for her granddaughter. Instead, you cut up your wife's dress to make a frock that can only be worn for a very limited time. Your daughter will grow out of it in the very near future. She will not remember wearing it. And now she will never again be able to wear the dress as her mom once did.", "NAH, I can see OP's point in wanting to use the item now and making something that would fit; but I also understand how her mother (and maybe also the deceased) would want the item preserved as it was made. This is assuming of course that the child will want to wear it eventually (regardless of assumption now, the kid could be a man, or may just want to make any dresses handed down into slacks/waistcoats etc later), and that it would fit them and be their style; it is also possible that other members of the family might appreciate some/one of the custom pieces themselves by which to remember their lost loved one.\n\n\nAll that said, I think there is an option here that might be manageable and might smooth things over.\n\n\nIf OP, either by finding the original order/shop, or ordering swatches of fabric till they find a match, can get the same material again; presuming that the baby dress was just taken from the biggest solid piece/s of the dress. It could be feasible to replace the cut portion of the dress to restore it to its former glory. If say, a waist seam would be a problem (a fitted top of the dress might already be a separate piece of the pattern to thr skirt parts), OP could attach a belt of gathered material over the seam to hide it etc. There are tons of ways to hide fixes and alterations (also a good idea to make any changes with extra wide seams so that they could be taken out if needed.\n\n\nAny extra fabric bought or used could be kept to make any further small dresses etc for the baby/kid as they grow, and the original dress and it's miniature counterpart(s) could be stored together to eventually be gifted as a set to the child when they're an adult/having a kid/getting married etc. \n\n\nHaving something their mum made first, then their dad remade a little, then their dad remaking the original, to me, seems a nice little bit of family history, and they all might cherish the story and the items of things being mended (the dress/es and the relationships) as needed.\n\n\nTake care OP, while I would expect it might go without saying at this point, and it can sound trite; I am so sorry that you've suffered such a loss as you have, and I hope you are gentle with yourself and others when it comes to the complicated feelings that happen along the path of grief that you all must now travel. I hope you can be good company and support to one another, while you and things change and you navigate how best to process and proceed. Theres no hard/fast/reliable rules for grieving, and we will all do so in our own ways; I hope everyone who loved your wife can stand together and weather the storms and preferences and any issues that arise, and that you each understand that different perspectives about the importance of things are normal. Nothing that happens to any item can hurt you as much as losing your wife did, and I expect the same carries for everyone else, I trust, regardless of current emotional feelings and with due reverence to the fact that your daughters birthday is also your wife's death-day, that you all appreciate that there is still a lot of hurt there and that you can muddle through without any lasting offence or misgivings.", "Also!!! OP if your wife bought the gown last year I would see if you could buy another one for future use for your daughter.

I mean, this wasn't even a wedding (or another occasion) dress, it was a dress the late mother wore to look good in her pregnant photos and never wore again. Even her wish that the daughter might wear it some day was probably her sentimentally thinking about her daughter one day having children of her own, not a serious expectation that her grown daughter would wear her decades-old maternity dress.

For all we know, she would have thought of it herself if she had lived, and I think we can safely assume her husband knows her wishes and level of sentimentality as well or better than her mother. I\u2019m a mother of a small child, and I actually wish I had thought of this for my little one\u2019s birthdays.

The birthday dress could now becomes an heirloom dress for girls in the family, to be passed down to OP\u2019s daughter for her future daughter(s) or granddaughters (whichever applies).", "2 identical dolls too as if it's a favourite when very young, OPs daughter may not like when it needs to go for a wash or mend. Always best to have a duplicate.", "You are right. All the more reason to repurpose it now. It will bring happy memories later and maybe feel like a part of her mom is with her.", "NAH. \n\nShe's grieving her daughter. You're also grieving your wife. I think you're probably both doing the best you can. Now, we're allowed to be judgey here, so I'm going to add: I do think your wife probably meant that she wanted your daughter to wear the gown itself, and your daughter will not remember her first birthday, so I'm not sure making a one year old's birthday dress out of it was the right call, but I think you were coming from a good place.", "NTA, and your MIL owes you an apology for trying to tell you how to remember your wife.", "NTA. I think what you did was a beautiful way to honor your wife.", "I would go as far as ask a photographer to photoshop them together so OP has a mommy and daughter photo.", "I\u2019m going to go full NAH *except* the other guests who got involved.\n\nGrief is weird.", "Or 4) Give it/ alter it for your daughter when she's older like the mother originally requested (so she can  wear it more than once or do what she wants with it)", "His daughter can still keep the dresser whole adult life. If she has a daughter she can let her wear it. If she has a son she can let him wear it!", "How do you know what his wife would have wanted better than he does? I genuinely would like to know. How do you know what his wife would have wanted?", "NTA if my mother had died giving birth to me, there\u2019s no way I would ever wear her maternity dress when I was pregnant. Too sad and also could feel like bad luck. I think what OP did was a beautiful way to honor his late wife\u2019s wish that their daughter would wear her dress. \n\nI am very sorry for OP\u2019s loss and that this turned out to be a source of contention on the baby\u2019s first birthday.\n\nEdit: typo", "There was never any guarantee that the daughter would grow up to be the same size as her mother so she could wear that dress.  Having it repurposed for her now guaranteed she would be able to wear it, and now she can set it aside later for her own baby, years from now.  That\u2019s the conversation OP can have with his MIL once she calms down.  Of course, that\u2019s assuming he ever wants to talk to her again. After her behavior, I\u2019d be wary of ever being around her unless she profusely apologizes.", "I think you need to calm down.  \n\nTrue, I didn't think about the anniversary of her daughters death but it's na\u00efve to not think there might be some mixed emotions looking at her grand daughter, it doesn't mean she doesn't love her though. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Also, there's no clock on grief. Maybe she is seeing a counselor, maybe she can't afford the hundreds of dollars a session to see a counselor? How the fuck do you know?\n\nobviously I'm just a random person on the internet and without any psychology qualifications but it's just my read from reading the post. OPs MIL broke down over a dress; even if it's not what my guess is, she needs or needs to continue grief counselling.", "I don't think at 1 year old the daughter can understand the specifics of what is going on, but she will definitely pick up on the tension and upset. Children that young are particularly in tune with the emotions of their caregivers. They have to be. They depend on them for survival. \n\nDaughter may not understand the reason for her grandmother getting so upset, but it was probably very distressing to have such a commotion. \n\nThe grandmother is grieving her own daughter. If she had quietly left, talked to OP later, then it would be perfectly understandable. Instead, she turned what was supposed to be a fun get-together into a battle zone. That was cruel to the granddaughter too.", "Grandmother absolutely ruined her birthday though. Even if she will forget it, she spent her birthday watching her grandma cry and her entire family in hysterics. Probably her dad cried too, as he is the one who had to celebrate on the very day he had lost his wife. While I do understand that grandma is grieving her daughter, it was very selfish of her to cause a scene and ruin the day for everyone else.", "She lost her daughter. I\u2019m sure she didn\u2019t mean it. I hope MIL apologizes when things are less raw.", "I would go one step further and say that MIL also blames the baby for taking her daughter.   And the baby wearing her daughter\u2019s \u201cdress\u201d in a new way just pushed her over the edge.", "I remember being a little girl wanting to wear my mother\u2019s very beautiful wedding dress when I got married. It was handmade by my great-grandmother.\n\nMy mother is a bird-boned 5\u20192\u201d. I\u2019m 5\u20198\u201d and of hearty Scandinavian stock from my dad\u2019s side. She had to let me down gently at around age 11 that it was unlikely to be feasible.", "They could also possibly find a doll that would be the same size for the dress and can dress it in this? That or adjust the dress again to fit a doll.", "I think the act of the daughter's dress being destroyed for the baby probably invoked stronger emotions than you're accounting for. Probably, in grief, grandma had to talk herself out of seeing her daughter dead for the sake of her granddaughter. This isn't a rational thought, but grief isn't rational. \n\nThen the dad destroys the daughter's maternity dress for the granddaughter's first birthday and the anniversary of her daughter's death. That's a really blatant representation of her irrational grief, with a nice side of representing the medical trauma too.\n\nEdit: This isn't to say that the husband was wrong, just that it sounds incredibly difficult if you're not ready for it and on board.", "Then it's NAH", ">obviously I'm just a random person on the internet and without any psychology qualifications but it's just my read from reading the post. OPs MIL broke down over a dress; even if it's not what my guess is, she needs or needs to continue grief counselling.\n\nYou don't know enough about the situation to make any conclusions.  Yeah, it's concerning that a dress caused this much of a reaction.  That's not any indication as to whether or not she is seeing someone about her grief.\n\nIt's a fucking process, sometimes it takes years to move past loss. With help, or without. \n\nBut to suggest that this poor woman, who suffered the worst loss a parent can suffer, resents her innocent granddaughter for the fucking loss is vile. That's such a serious accusation and you're making it based on fucking nothing.\n\nYou are not a psychologist, you are not a psychiatrist, you are not a mental health professional. You are imminently under qualified to say shit like that. If you were a professional, you'd know damn well that there isn't enough information here to know a fucking thing about this woman's life and what she needs to heal.\n\nGrief is a fucked up thing, it makes people do weird shit they normally wouldn't, and frankly, I'm fucking sick of the armchair psychologists in this fucking sub who seem to think that there is no excuse for having an emotional reaction to a situation,  or condemning people as assholes when they aren't assholes. They're grieving. There's a fucking difference.\n\nWe should be more understanding of that fact, not rushing to condemn people for losing control. Emotional regulation isn't easy for everyone, even under normal circumstances.", "I agree with NAH. MIL was inappropriate but is also grieving so I'll cut her some slack, which doesn't mean OP did anything wrong or has to accept the MIL's words.", "I agree. We could be wrong of course, but a mother who lost her child was acting crazy at the anniversary of her death. In other news, the sky is blue. Probably NAH if she apologizes.", "/u/Profesvgh is a bot that stole part of this comment: /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ggv6f/aita_for_repurposing_my_late_wifes_gown_for_my/jfk7i4g/", "I agree. Pregnancy is already a mix of hormones and anxiety without trying to attach a sentimental item where the outcome was tragic the first time. Even knowing that her mother died from complications giving birth will probably bring the daughter anxiety if she ever decides to have kids.", "> Yeah, I feel like Grandma is probably struggling not to blame the baby for her daughter's death...\n\nI feel like on some level, Grandma blames OP for her daughter's death.", "Widowest?", "And when would she wear a maternity dress?  I think the chances of that are low, even when or if she gets pregnant some day.  From the title I thought it might be her wedding dress which I could sort of understand.  But a maternity dress?  MIL needs some counseling here and if she gets this upset over this dress, what\u2019s she going to do the next time OP does something in raising his daughter that she doesn\u2019t like? OP is definitely NTA."]}
