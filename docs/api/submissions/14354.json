She had a premature delivery that lead to complications and eventually, she passed away an hour after giving birth to our daughter. My daughter too had resulting complications which meant she had to be kept in a NICU for the first 2 months of her life. \n\nNeedless to be said, the entire ordeal was hard on us, especially her mother, who was a single mom to her only child. Fortunately, my daughter's condition grew better after those initial 2 months, and is as lively and joyful as any other 1 year old.\n\nIt was my baby's first birthday a few days ago. It was bittersweet. I wished my wife could've been here to see our baby girl on her first milestone.  I wanted to honor my wife's memory and also make my daughter feel the presence of her mother on her special day. My wife used to have a talent for stitching, and she'd taught me a lot of it too. \n\nMy wife had worn a beautiful dark green gown for her maternity shoots. She looked absolutely radiant in it that day, but after that she never wore it again. She said she wanted to see my daughter wear it one day. The gown was left forgotten there with her entire pile of clothes after her death. I didn't want to go through her stuff since it would've been too much for me.\n\nHer words, the grief of knowing that my wife never got to know her daughter and my daughter's birthday were what motivated me to get up one day, go through her closet and cut up that green gown into a tiny frock for my daughter. And my daughter looked absolutely adorable in it. That colour suits my daughter just as it did to my wife.\n\nI dressed up my daughter in the gown for the birthday party. My MIL saw her in it and immediately knew that this was that dress. She pulled me aside, in tears, and asked me why I would destroy her daughter's dress. I told her what my wife had said, that this was her wish too. She said that my wife would've meant that for when my daughter was old enough to fit into the gown. That she could've also said that assuming she would be alive to see her in it, and that her death negates what she said. Her dress held a memory of my wife that no longer existed now because of what I did.\n \nI told her that the dress had been lying forgotten in the closet along with all of her other belongings. All her other special dresses are still there, her wedding gown, her baby shower dress, everything was still intact and perfectly preserved in her closet. It was just this one dress that I used. The dress she specifically mentioned she wanted our daughter to wear one day. I honoured her wishes, a little earlier than intended.\n\nThe argument escalated, with other people joining in and taking sides. Soon, my MIL left, along with most of the guests. She isn't replying to my calls. All our relatives have mixed opinions about this.\n\nI am devastated. All I wanted to do was make this birthday extra special for my daughter. Instead, her entire day ended in tears. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681039948, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ggv6f/aita_for_repurposing_my_late_wifes_gown_for_my/", "score": 404, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You created a beautiful tribute to your wife. You now have your wife\u2019s maternity shoot photos and your daughter\u2019s first birthday photos wearing the same piece of clothing. There\u2019s not only still the memories of your wife wearing it but now new beautiful memories of your daughter wearing it. \n\nI WAS going to go with N A H owing to your MIL still grieving her child, but given how she took an already difficult event and attached bad memories to it by escalating the argument and invoking the other guests, I\u2019m giving YOU the benefit of the doubt.", "NTA.  \n\n\nYou honored your wife and extended her love and presence to your daughter. And as you said, it was a dress, she only wore for her maternity photo shoot. Maternity shoots weren't even a thing 20 years ago, so it doesn't have the same gravitas or historical importance as other dresses, such as the wedding dress. You did absolutely nothing wrong.    \n\n\nBut grief is a tough thing, and people grieve in different ways, and grief isn't always rational. Your MIL is being irrational right now. Hopefully she will calm down and eventually apologize to you.", "NTA. I think your wife would have been delighted to know that her dress was right there to accompany your daughter on her first birthday. I understand why your MIL would be upset but she doesn't have any authority over your wife's maternity dress.", "NAH. Your daughter's first birthday is unfortunately also the first anniversary of your wife's death and that is a hard day (as Insane sure you know). Your MIL is probably fighting all kinds of feelings and was overwhelmed by seeing the dress and realizing that the future she had hoped for her daughter was lost forever and she might have complicated feelings towards your daughter that she might be afraid to even voice. \n\nBut what you did was a beautiful and lovely thing. I would frame side by side pictures of your wife and daughter both in the dress and put them in your daughter's room.", "NAH. I don't think MIL is an AH; repurposing an adult's dress for a 1 year old is your choice, but it also means this isn't a dress your daughter will now get to wear over and over again because she'll grow out of it. I can see why MIL was upset. That said, you aren't an AH either. It's just a sad situation for you all.", "NAH.  It sounds like your MIL is understandably upset and grieving in her own way.  It\u2019s not fair to you that she is lashing out about the dress but I don\u2019t think it makes her an AH in this circumstance.  Give her some space for the time being and reach out in the relatively near future (~1 month) if you haven\u2019t heard from her.  You\u2019ve already apologized so continuing to reach out will likely only serve to make her more resentful.  \n\nGood luck, OP.  You\u2019ve been through a lot and it sounds like you\u2019re trying to do your best in a terribly difficult situation.  There really is no playbook for navigating these kinds of situations and you\u2019ll undoubtedly upset people along the way, but that does not always mean you\u2019ve gotten it wrong.  This is a good example of that.", "NAH, It's quite touching what you did and at the end of the day the dress belongs to you by default. \n\nBut...... you've overlooked your MIL also lost a daughter, so it may have been better if you told her of what you wanted to do, just so she was mentally prepared to see the dress again.", "NTA\u2014 even if she didn\u2019t understand the choice, she chose to ruin the day. \nYou can\u2019t keep your house a museum to your wife\u2014 you found a beautiful way to live with her memory and keep it alive. \nIt\u2019s kind of you to invite your wife\u2019s mother and other family to your daughter\u2019s birthday party but you don\u2019t really have to anymore. She should understand that if she makes a habit of attacking you, she won\u2019t get invited anymore. I get that it\u2019s sad for her to lose your daughter and be at the mercy of her husband to get any access to your granddaughter but that\u2019s how it is.", "It's not their decision. You haven't done anything wrong.\n\nNta", "NAH - you and your MIL are still grieving and everyone grieves differently. You did something to honor your wife in a way you felt appropriate. Your MIL has a different perspective. I think, to mend some bridges, have a conversation with MIL about how to continue honoring your wife going forward and also what to do with her belongings.", "NAH, you're all suffering here  Nobody was deliberately looking to hurt anyone else, it was just a hugely difficult day all round and emotions spilled over.  Anger is often used to mask other emotions, being angry, upset and blaming you would have been easier to cope with than the devastation of the anniversary of the loss of her daughter.", "First - the most sincerest of condolences on your loss.  \nSecond - NTA. You\u2019re in a difficult enough situation.  You are doing the best you can.  Honoring your wife\u2019s wishes the best way you can is beautiful thing.  \nYour family will have mixed emotions about  everything you do because your wife isn\u2019t there.  It may be difficult for many years but they\u2019ll come to accept that you\u2019re doing the best you can.  Good luck, OP.  Hugs from a stranger.", "NTA  this sounds like a good way for you to process your grief and include your late wife's memory in an important milestone for you daughter.  You likely will keep a few important dresses for your daughter but it's unfair to expect you to keep them all.  It's a shame that .your in laws reacted so poorly.  Happy Birthday to your daughter!", "Idk about aita but I'm ugly crying rn", "NAH. \n\nYour MIL lost her only daughter, and your baby's birthday is the anniversary of that life-rending tragedy. It would be both wise and kind to include her in future birthday plans both for her grieving process and for the benefit of your daughter.", "NAH.\n\nYou are grieving. Your MIL is grieving. Grief can cause us to have almost a primal protection over things we used to barely give a second thought to, even when we feel we are working through our grief. \n\nYour MIL reacted to something her daughter loved, but only used briefly, being re-purposed. This was something her daughter once wore, and she reacted in the way that came most naturally to her and her grief in that moment. \n\nYou created a beautiful thing for your daughter out of a beautiful thing purchased to celebrate her existence. The wound is still fresh for your MIL, as I\u2019m sure it still is for you, and she\u2019s reaching the anger stage of her grief, which more comes in random tidal waves than anything. \n\nAny of your wife\u2019s belongings can still be used by your daughter when she grows up. Things that were cherished by her that can allow your daughter to feel close to her. \n\nYour relatives have mixed emotions because no one is in the wrong. This day would have ended in tears regardless. It\u2019s the reality of one of the many firsts your wife, and your MIL\u2019s daughter, will miss. Everyone is still grieving, and ready to put their emotions on something else.", "NTA sounds like a lovely thing to do for your daughter. My mum died a couple of years ago. She used to wear very full skirts that contained a lot of fabric. My lovely friend used the fabric from some of her favourite skirts to make teddy bears for me and my children. \n\nWhen your daughter has grown out of the dress maybe you can save it for if she has a daughter or put it on a special teddy or doll for her to keep. \nI can understand this would be an emotive situation for your MIL but she can\u2019t expect you to keep everything that meant something to your daughter as is.", "NTA. That was a touching tribute.  I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "You are NTA, OP. \n\nGrief is such a heavy and difficult thing the go through and live with. Your MIL wants to preserve her daughter\u2019s memory with possessions, but her granddaughter is what keeps her daughter alive, not a dress. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry you lost your wife and your daughter lost her mother. I\u2019m so sorry for all of you still navigating the channels of grief. \n\nYou did nothing wrong and, in time, your MIL will (hopefully) see that and apologize.", "I think you knew your wife meant your daughter to wear that dress when she was all grown up and you knew the dress was important to you MIL too. Your wife left the dress to your daughter as it was. You had a nice thought but it didn't go as you planned. Still I think it would be too strong to state that you're the a-hole. So NTA. \n\nEverybody seems to be very emotional because the death was not too long ago and it was not expected. I feel for you. Take some good pictures of your daughter in the green dress. Or have a professional photoshoot. Put the picture next your wife's in the same dress. Send those to your MIL too. She will come around.", "I am so sorry that what you wanted to do as a beautiful tribute was reacted to by others\u2019 grief so negatively. NAH. Grief sucks and everyone\u2019s grief journey is different.", "NAH - because you destroyed the gown, your MIL for making things more difficult than they needed to be. \n\n\nBut you are both grieving and I'm not about to call you both TA because of the way you are grieving, because you are both at the centre of the loss and you are both not thinking 100% clearly.", "NTA, that dress meant your wife had a physical presence at her daughter's first birthday. I personally would of loved that idea. Yeah it might of been earlier than intended but your wife also intended to be there for that for that moment. I think it was a beautiful gesture and while I understand MILs grief she over reacted and couldn't see it for the wonderful act it was.", "NTA. I thought it was going to be the wedding dress. \n\nThis was a lovely idea. Your MIlL is obviously struggling with her grief. Give her some space and when you\u2019re both ready, maybe ask her if there\u2019s something special she\u2019d like to keep?", "NTA. It's easy to understand why some people are upset, but I think the sentiment is touching. Your daughter might also find it touching when she's older. Or she might be upset. There's still the wedding dress and my advice is to protect it with your life.", "NAH. Just a lot of people with very raw emotions trying to deal with grief in their own way. There's no logic here, nobody is acting out to purposefully spite anyone else, and nobody is being unreasonably selfish. The worst that could be said is that someone is not handling their grief very well, and... I mean, who does?", "NAH but I would save the rest of your wife's heirlooms for when your daughter is old enough to appreciate them.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. NTA. You did a nice thing that was motivated by love. Hopefully your MIL will see that one day when things are less raw.", "NTA, your MIL is grieving but her creating a scene at your daughters birthday party is unacceptable. I\u2019m sure your wife would have loved that her dress and in turn she herself was present at your daughters birthday. Your MIL need to learn to respect you as your daughters only parent, or understand that she\u2019s going to kill a relationship with her granddaughter.", "NTA you have ownership over the dress.", "1000% NTA\n\nMIL Is trying to fill a daughter sized hole with a dress. It won\u2019t work.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for both of your losses and SO GLAD your daughter is thriving.", "NTA she is your wife and it's your choice how her intentions are interpreted.so sorry people are doing this to you.", "NTA- I think it\u2019s lovely what you did. I hope you have lots of pictures of her in her beautiful dress. It\u2019s even so much more special that you made it for her. Now she has a connection to you both. A touching way to remember her mom, and a keepsake from you.\n\nI\u2019m sorry her party turned divisive and ended in anger. You are both just grieving in your own way. Hopefully some space for a few days will allow you both to process. Maybe once the dust has settled you can have a little photoshoot with your little girl in her dress with her grandma. Then you can have some special new memories in the dress. Maybe even take some pictures of her in places or doing things your wife liked while in the dress too?\n\nHope you all find healing, so sorry for your loss \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. What you did was a wonderful tribute to your late wife, and now the dress can be preserved as a keepsake for your daughter. When she's old enough to understand, you can tell her the story behind the dress. \n\nYou had the best of intentions and it's just a shame that your MIL was triggered so strongly by the sight of the dress. You had no way of anticipating that kind of reaction. Like you said, the dress had been laying there unnoticed since your wife's death.", "NTA", "NTA. This is about you, your late wife and your daughter. Your MIL needs to realize this. I think what you did was lovely and your daughter will appreciate it when she's old enough to understand.", "Nah!! and I'm so very sorry!", "NTA but almost NAH. You had every right to do what you did and it would be reasonable to expect your MIL to approve of it. However she is also grieving so whilst her reaction/attitude is wrong she should be given a lot of leeway. \n\nI think a face to face conversation after a couple of days will settle it and likely have you both crying together apologising to each other", ">\tNeedless to be said, the entire ordeal was hard on us, especially her mother,\n\nDying can be a very traumatic experience.

It is so sweet. She can feel close to her mother!", "You're obviously nta, how you and your daughter grieve and find joy is yours and yours alone.", "NTA whatsoever. You have now made a beautiful and sentimental reminder of your wife. It\u2019s something your daughter can pass down to her kids and have them wear it on their first birthday. \n\nYour MIL is way out of line. It wasn\u2019t your wife\u2019s only dress. I\u2019m sure there are plenty of mementos of your wife for your daughter and MIL to have. She doesn\u2019t get to decide what happens.

You instead cut it to pieces for a 1 year old who wont remember or appreciate any of that sentiment, which was most likely the sole purpose of your wife\u2019s request. She\u2019s also going to grow fast and spend almost no time in that dress. You should have been more patient and waited until she grew up to fit her to that dress. I\u2019m not really sure how you could misinterpret this, unless you were trying to speed-run your wife\u2019s last wish to get some closure. Unless you have the skills to fix that dress somehow, your daughter will never get that special moment back in a way that she\u2019ll truly appreciate it. The only way to even partially fix this would be to find and use another of her special dresses.", "NTA.\n\nThis is just weird on MIL's part (and a bit yours for the preserved 'baby shower dress').\n\nThese dresses now belong to you (presumably). So, you get to choose what to do with them.\n\nYour wife said she hopes your daughter will wear this someday--she very likely said a lot of things during her pregnancy about her hopes for her child. That doesn't mean the dress was particularly sentimental, and certainly not that it absolutely had to be preserved until the point your daughter fits it (or if and when she is herself pregnant).\n\nShe also 'wanted to see' your daughter wear it. The fact that is tragically not possible isn't changed regardless of what happens to the dress.\n\nThe memories are the memories and the photos, ffs. I have no idea what your MIL was going on about.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss, and you seem to understand how much your MIL is grieving. She is in fact an AH here and needs to let you live and use your things and your late wife's things as you see fit and raise your daughter as you wish.\n\nLet it lie. Your MIL may recover some sanity about this. I'm sorry your family sees fit to get involved; they have nothing to do with this and if they mention it to you, you need to tell them so.\n\nAll the best to you and your daughter.", "NTA, but they are for making a big deal about it and leaving. \n\nThe MIL is still grieving, but she was the AH. It\u2019s not her call and it\u2019s not a dress left to her, she\u2019s just in grief.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

One day she\u2019ll be able to look at her mothers maternity photos and her first birthday photos and be able to share why the dress she\u2019s wearing is so special. You created a beautiful memory out of your grief you\u2019ve been feeling. Your MIL is allowed to feel upset but that doesn\u2019t mean She gets to take it out on you. Give her space because she may be feeling raw right now.\n\nBut you, in no way did anything wrong. If you still have all your wife\u2019s clothes maybe look into creating something like a pillow for your daughter as another way to connect your daughter to her mum.", "NTA  at all and a lovely way to incorporate your wife's memory into the birthday.    I'm sorry that the drama ruined the party.", "NTA I think you should have a heart to heart with your MIL after things have calmed down a bit. You're both dealing with the loss differently and that day was definitely going to bring back some sad memories. \n\nYou should explain how you did what you did to honour your wife's wish/memory and in a way have her there for your daughter's first birthday, but also recognise your MIL's feelings and how you should have discussed it with her or given her a heads up before doing so. \n\nI'm sorry for your loss, Happy Birthday to your daughter and I hope you reconcile with your MIL.", "Nta. You're all grieving, she's used this instance to take her frustration out, unfairly so, but grief makes us all a bit crazy. Give her time. If she's a quality person, she'll want to be back in your daughter's lives and apologize.", "NTA. Because what if your daughter didn\u2019t want to wear that dress when she got older? Then no one would have seen her in it. But if your daughter decides to have any kids, she can dress them in it for their first birthday too.", "NTA - I\u2019m so sorry for your loss, what you did was incredibly heart felt and beautiful. I\u2019m going to say something that may come across as harsh but I think MiL needs some logic and realism once she\u2019s calmed down. Your daughter is a separate person to your wife. She will not be able to dress Daughter up in your wife\u2019s preserved clothing and have her daughter back. Let\u2019s be real for a moment, will your daughter grow up to be the same size and shape as your wife? What if she\u2019s a lot bigger or far too small? Will MiL put pressure on her to be the same size so she can wear her dead mothers clothes? What if your Daughter doesn\u2019t *want* to wear the clothes? I have the horrible foreboding feeling that MiL is going to put a lot on your daughter now she\u2019s lost hers. With the new dress your daughter has a beautiful heirloom that\u2019s something of BOTH her parents now. The dress her mother wore and the dress her father made with nothing but love in his heart. I think that\u2019s a far more valuable momento than a dress that was worn once for a photoshoot. She has something extra special now and you made that happen for her. She\u2019s a lucky little girl to have you.", "NTA. You honored the spirit of your wife\u2019s wishes while living with the realities of life with her gone. Keep being a thoughtful parent.", "NTA You are all grieving, your hearts are broken.  Mil is a bad griever in this instance.  She failed with the one person who is hurting as much as she is.  You will grieve in your way, she will grieve in hers.  You will both fail each other because the hurt is too great to bear at times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ni am so sorry for your hurt on that day and all the others.  I am glad you have a thriving daughter to embrace.  Be well.", "NTA\u2026I have an unhealthy emotional attachment to objects from my past and realize that it is due to being unable to process unresolved feelings from my life. I essentially boxed and stored them and left them to revisit later. It\u2019s less about the objects themselves but the feelings and memories that they evoke. I\u2019m now in my 60\u2019s and many items remain untouched and their stories unpackaged.\n\nI commend you for the courage to revisit a difficult experience and literally fashion a beautiful and special commemoration of your wife\u2019s dress, your hands together with your daughter for her first birthday. You are doing what your MIL is also needing to do but is extremely difficult\u2026grieve and let go. It takes time and your MIL obviously had her own meltdown upon seeing the dress\u2026NTA.", "NTA What you did was heartfelt and amazing! Grieving is hard. It's one garment. I hope she comes around. Best wishes, you're doing fantastic as a father so far.", "Nta. Grief can be irrational, but that doesn\u2019t excuse people from being assholes while they\u2019re grieving. Repurposing the dress, you did a lovely thing, for your daughter, your late wife, and yourself. It could\u2019ve been a lovely thing for MIL too, but it\u2019s not your fault she\u2019s not receptive to it now.", "You did nothing wrong.  You did a wonderful name.", "NTA - of course MIL is still grieving... but did everyone forget you are too.  \n\nI'm sorry for your loss and I'm sure the dress was beautiful. Take the dress and go do something fun just the two of you. It doesn't matter what it is. Maybe take good photos and find someone who can combine the pictures of your daughter and wife in the same dress, and display it proudly in your home. It could be a beautiful way  to celebrate the love of both of them.\n\n I'm sorry that your MIL's grief overshadowed the celebration.\n\n Make good memories. Enjoy life.", "Hopefully she will calm down and eventually apologize to you.", "Nta, I think this is a very beautiful way to have your wife celebrating with you. I understand why your MIL got upset, but at the end of the day, you did something nice and thoughtful with the dress.", "You did absolutely NOTHING wrong!  NTA.", "NTA. You did a beautiful thing for your precious daughter. I\u2019m sure your wife is watching over you appreciating how you honored her. I\u2019m sure your MIL is just going through a hard time and got emotional, which is understandable since she lost her daughter. She didn\u2019t handle it the best and that put quite a damper on things but just know that it\u2019s not your fault. I\u2019m sure she feels guilty on her end too. I wouldn\u2019t reach out anymore. If she wants to see her granddaughter she\u2019s going to have to reach out to you anyway. I\u2019d just wait it out and tell her you are sorry it was hard for her to see the dress altered but that you didn\u2019t do anything wrong and you did a nice thing. \n\nI\u2019m also really really sorry for your loss. You seem like such a great dad and are doing everything to do what you can for your family. Your little girl is in great hands.", "Clothes don't hold memories, people do. You made a beautiful memory for your daughter, your MIL made a horrible one.", "NTA, you did a really wonderful, beautiful thing. As a motherless daughter I would've LOVED something like this. So sorry for your loss friend.", "NTA. I personally would have waited until the daughter was old enough to understand the significance because there's no way she'll remember her first birthday. But you had every right to do it whenever you wanted. Grandma should not have made a huge scene over it.", "NTA", "Absolutely NTA!! What a beautiful, thoughtful, loving gesture, and even more meaningful because you had the ability to create it yourself. I am so very sorry for the pain you all suffer and I\u2019m sure your poor MIL was lashing out blindly but that doesn\u2019t make it any less hurtful for you. I\u2019m so sorry. Please don\u2019t doubt yourself or what you did; this was a wonderful thing! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "NAH, just people grieving differently. I\u2019m sorry for your loss and glad your little girl is doing well. You both interpreted what your late wife said differently. I\u2018d definitely have taken it like your MIL but don\u2019t think your way was wrong either - it\u2019s easy to see it like that when you\u2019re not involved in the situation. Your MIL is grieving her only child so I\u2018m not prepared to call her an AH over this on the first anniversary of your wife\u2019s death. Likewise, I wouldn\u2019t have cut it up for a 1yo simply because she\u2018ll be grown out of it within weeks, but certainly won\u2019t call you an AH over doing it because it felt right. \n\nI hope you\u2019re all getting support for your grief. \ud83d\udc99", "Nta at all. Honestly NAH, your MIL is obviously still grieving as I'm sure you are, too. It sounds like she was overcome by emotion, but you didn't do anything wrong. I think it was a beautiful thing you did and I bet your daughter looked beautiful in it. I'm so sorry for your loss. Let your MIL be, she probably just needs time.", "My condolences. nta.. but some distance between you and your mil... is in order.. you late wife's belongings are yours and you will be eventually  moving on with your life..expect more blow ups..", "NAH. It's a tough situation. I get MILs feelings, but you created a beautiful keepsake for your daughter. Can the photographer who did the maternity shoot take photos of your daughter in the dress and maybe stitch a maternity image together with daughter in her dress? Or have the dress shadow boxed or preserved, maybe one day her daughter can wear it too. A beautiful tribute to your wife that can span generations?", "This is the simplest case of NTA I\u2019ve read on here yet. Your MIL does not get to dictate how you honor your late wife. I think what you did with the dress was beautiful and your wife was certainly smiling down on both of you. She would definitely be disappointed in the rest of the family, because they are the ones acting like AHs. MIL took a special day and made it all about her, not about your daughter or your wife.", "NTA!!! Lots of great comments here.", "NAH - you made a mistake. A dress your daughter could have kept her whole adult like is now a dress she will grow out of in a few weeks. It's disappointing but you were doing the best you could through your grief. I'm so sorry for your loss.", "I hated when people take sides (except on Reddit). All the people on the birthdayparty should have tried to calm MIL down and build bridges instead of polarize.", "This is the big thing for me. For her to be unable to give son in law the benefit of the doubt OR prioritize the feelings of her granddaughter (both of whom are just as bereft by this death as she is) it telling. OR, for that matter, the spirit of what she *knows* her daughter would have wanted. \n\nIt\u2019s a dress. Her daughter can\u2019t wear it anymore. Her granddaughter is experiencing an incredibly meaningful moment and getting joy out of it, which is the point. \n\nDoes MIL honest to Jesus think her daughter would approve of how she behaved today? I think not. She\u2019s not protecting her late daughter\u2019s wishes or belongings. She\u2019s holding other people responsible for preserving her memories of her daughter. Which is unfair.\n\nAnd to involve the other guests rather than just excusing herself quietly is inexcusable.  Your granddaughter and son in law are what you have left of your daughter. Not her dresses that don\u2019t belong to you in the first place. If you want to risk losing them over a dress, then you can go home and cry over pictures of her in the dress and leave your son in law and granddaughter out of it. \n\nOP, I would be firm about this. Let your daughter know they while grandmother is grieving, this explains her feelings but not her behaviour. Reassure your daughter that her mother would be proud and that seeing her in that dress was a beautiful thing. And let your MIL know that, while you appreciate her grief, you will NOT allow your daughter to take the brunt of her projections. You and MIL at least HAVE memories of your late wife to cherish. Your daughter deserves to feel a connection to her. \n\nAnd until MIL can appreciate and honour that, then she will not be welcome into your lives or to share in the memory of her daughter alongside the two of you. She can share her grief in solidarity with the living, is she can stay at home and mourn her daughter alone", "I could not agree more. OP created a beautiful story around both his daughter and late wife, using a meaningful momento. His daughter will always cherish both sets of photos, and he gave what would otherwise be a garment with sadness attached a new purpose and a new life. I think it's beautiful.\n\nI feel for MIL because she too has experienced a significant loss. People grieve in different ways. But to vilify OP for what was a lovely, thoughtful way of honouring his wife is what makes this NTA instead of NAH.", "I agree! Also NTA. I know the MIL is grieving her daughter & it\u2019s very hard on a mother but this day is about her granddaughter. He didn\u2019t ruin the dress, throw it away or do anything to disrespect his wife\u2019s memory. He actually did something beautiful that honored her and his daughter! \nSending you love and happiness OP! You deserve it", "MIL definitely made it all about her. Not the baby, not even OP\u2019s late wife.\n\nI was skimming the post at first and with the way MIL reacted I thought it was the wedding gown OP repurposed. Repurposing the maternity dress for the first birthday was an amazing idea. It\u2019s like, hey baby\u2019s finally here and can now wear the cloth covering the then-bump on mommy\u2019s belly!\n\nIf anything I\u2019m glad it\u2019s only baby\u2019s first birthday. At least she won\u2019t remember how awful people acted.\n\nHugs, OP!", "And how the I want to see my daughter wear it someday was interpreted by OP was his right. He lost someone too and he wanted her to share a part of his daughter's day. \n\nThis was his right. Maybe MIL.needs a little distance. She ruined what should have been a happy day. Thank goodness his daughter will have no memories of that day.", "This \u2b06\ufe0f", "I agree with the thoughtful post above and just wanted to add that you sound like an awesome Dad.", "Totally agree, well said! Also, there's no guarantee your daughter would have ever worn the maternity dress for a shoot. She may decide to not have kids, it's not a given that that is her path. This way she got to wear it like her mom wanted in such a beautiful tribute.", "She needs to remember HE is grieving too", "I agree, it likely took her by surprise and she didn't handle it well, doesn't excuse her behaviour but as you said, grief isn't always rational.", "I agree completely. When the late mother said she'd like to see her daughter wear the dress \"one day,\" it could be interpreted as wearing it when it would fit her (my thinking too) or modified so the daughter could wear it any point in the future.\n\nMy late mother's wedding dress was kept, but coffee spilt on it before it was packed away for 3 decades. This meant there was no way my sister could use it when she got married. Instead, my sister cut off a piece and sewed it into the train of her gown. If I get married, I'm going to use some of the fabric to create a flower to wear on my dress. It's been repurposed, and since our mom was an excellent crafter, we're using it in a way that she'd love.", "There is no guarantee his daughter would ever need a maternity dress. Or fit the same size as her mother. \nAnd I doubt anyone wears a maternity gown \u201cover and over\u201d anyway.", "Not only lost a daughter but the birthday is the first anniversary of the daughter's death. I definitely agree NAH and this is just a hard situation all around.", "Agreed, except please do not send the images to your MIL unless she specifically asks. Keep those to yourself.", "OP didn\u2019t destroy the gown. He repurposed it beautifully. His wife has tons of clothes and possessions to save. Also why should MIL have any say on what he does with the maternity dress? He is the father of the baby. He has more right to that dress than she does.", "It's also the anniversary of her daughter's death.", "He means his wife's mother?", "Ok but dress styles change a lot. By the time the daughter is old enough to really wear the dress it\u2019s likely to be very out of fashion. I.e get one or two photo op wears for the same purpose of putting it next to the picture of mom.  So I maintain NAH.", "I could never wear any of my mother's clothes, even if I wanted too. I am several inches taller and a completely different build. So saving clothes with that intention is always a crapshoot. \n\nAlso who knows if daughter will ever have her own children there is no guarantee that she would ever have need for a maternity dress.\n\nInstead, OP made sure that she got to wear the dress. He can save the baby dress (and also presumably the rest of the stress material). I would suggest he get professional photos of his daughter in the dress and then they can have the pictures side by side, which would be a beautiful memento for his daughter. .", "His wife wanted their teen daughter to wear a maternity gown? I doubt that. \n\nAnd what if she\u2019s significantly larger than her mother? Never gets pregnant? Doesn\u2019t want the gown???", "The daughter is only 1. I think explaining that much is a little beyond her.", "The child is 1 year old, she won\u2019t be able to cherish this moment for at least another 9-14 years when she\u2019s old enough to understand. The grandmother didn\u2019t ruin this moment for the baby, the baby has no idea what\u2019s going. Doesn\u2019t make sense", " Happy Birthday to your daughter!", " I hope she comes around. Best wishes, you're doing fantastic as a father so far.", "There's also the fact that there's no guarantee the daughter will have a similar enough body type to her mother to wear it, even if she does decide to get pregnant and have a maternity shoot. I know I certainly wouldn't be able to wear any clothes my mother wore at my age (no, not even if I lost weight, our body shapes are just that different), so if she had left me a wedding gown or a maternity gown like that it would not have been usable for me except as fabric.", "Obv, either way it'd need to be altered. My only point was taking it from an adult dress to a dress for a 1 year old was a dramatic change and I can see why MIL was shocked and upset. Doesn't mean OP is an AH in any shape or form.", "This, there\u2019s no guarantee she would make it to the age of her being able to wear it as well. I understand MIL is grieving, but she is still on the verge AH here. I\u2019m sure her daughter would be pissed how she handled things.", "Yes, and she made it about herself and created a scene for something that could have been a private conversation at a later date.", "He hadn\u2019t mentioned her at all at that point and the last person he did mention was his daughter. \u201cher mother\u201d then implies his late wife.", "My mom saved her wedding dress for my sister and I. Even if she was deceased, neither of us would/could wear it. My mom is tiny, the dress is extremely dated, and we wanted our own memories."]}
