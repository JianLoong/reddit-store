Hasnt spoken a single word with my sister since that day.", "OP and the others choosing not to attend are not at fault here. OP's brother and future wife are unfairly excluding OP's sister based on the fact that she breastfeeds (something about which they seem to be ignorant/have ignorant views). Nobody has to support the couple or their rules _or_ accept their invitation just because it's \"their day.\" If your \"rules\" for your wedding are asinine, then you're an asshole for making them. If a bunch of your family members are boycotting your wedding, you should ask yourself, \"Am I being an asshole?\"", "Just replying to say THIS RIGHT HERE!!!!! Support for daughter and grandchild.", "We laugh, but I have seen this happen. I'm not assigning any moral judgment to it. But it's a thing", "Let me guess: the bride doesnt want kids at the wedding. \n\nBut with HER sister its different. Not with HIS sister, obviously because: no kids", "This . .  makes me so sad . . that women's breasts are considered so indecent, or ugly, or whatever people think is wrong with them, that it becomes a horrendous difficulty for mothers to breast feed their infants.", "I\u2019ve seen many a woman breastfeed. Friends, family, family friends. I have seen none of their nips. \n\nI just . . . look slightly over their head while they get baby situated and the conversation keeps chugging along. It\u2019s not just not a big deal it\u2019s not a deal at all. It\u2019s an anti-deal.", "I hope the dress code says no plunging neck lines, as it would be distracting.", "There are babies as young as seven to ten months who can start to run, and the average for most children to start weaning is a year to even two years old. It's not unexpected nor is it something that harmed anyone in the process.", "Oh I completely agree that she shouldn\u2019t have to do that. \n\nUnfortunately, if they are really insistent on her not doing it inside with everyone else and the venue doesn\u2019t have anything else to offer it\u2019s a better solution to sit in a car that can be heated instead of being just outside. \n\nRegardless the sister and nephew should clearly be invited and she should be allowed to feed him anywhere they are.", "Tbh, looking back doing both made everything so much easier since daddy could also feed her and I could take some breaks\ud83d\ude05", "But FaMiLy!!!! /s", "That's quite nice!"]}
