Last minute thing, I'm very happy for him. My twin sister has just had her first baby, and as such is breastfeeding. Baby will still be 100% breastfed (if all goes to plan) by the time the wedding happens.\n\nMy brother and soon to be wife doesn't want any kids under ten at the wedding, but the brides sisters infant is allowed to attend. We assumed my sister would be allowed, too, so didn't really question it. The babies are the same age.\n\nLast week my brother corrected us and said our nephew wasn't invited. He didn't specify past that for a bit, but later did reveal that its because they don't want her breastfeeding and attracting attention. \n\nMy sister doesn't think she can attend and so he said that was fine, they wouldn't account for her. She got really upset (later blamed it on hormones, but she's always looked up to him so I think it meant more to her that she's saying). So, basically, she is no longer invited to the wedding. \n\nI later on informed my brother that he could take me off the invited list, too, because I wouldn't be attending without my sister and nephew. Word got out among our family and two younger siblings have also decided they aren't going now.\n\nIts created a bit of a situation as you can probably imagine.\n\nOur brother is pissed as all hell. He's calling me and telling me I've ruined his big day, begged me to speak to the younger two, asked me to attend, etc. I've always been firm in my no.\n\nOur parents \"stepped in\" and are doing the whole \"You need to support your brother,\" Blah blah. No one, besides the three siblings who also aren't attending, are on my side. I was thinking it was because my brother is just the favourite (oldest, golden child) but now I'm wondering if I was seriously out of line.\n\nAITA?

It is about a celebration with family and friends.

Not to mention nursing a baby isn\u2019t a huge deal. She\u2019ll probably want to go somewhere quieter than the reception to do it or be quite discreet because babies often don\u2019t nurse super well in busy, loud environments anyway.

Or it\u2019s all about a fake image of a happy family he\u2019s trying to present. If anyone ruined his big day it\u2019s him and his soon to be wife. Good for OP and his other siblings for having their sister\u2019s and nephew\u2019s  backs. Too bad their parents couldn\u2019t do the same. But they shouldn\u2019t try and intervene.

We\u2019re supposed to be respecting boundaries nowadays. Not forcing adherence to others wishes and demands.", "I mean choosing to call out the hypocrisy isn\u2019t really being an asshole. If the only concern is her breast feeding openly, she can go to another room or out of sight. It\u2019s a bs excuse because chances are the bride wants her sister there bad enough to deal w her own niece or nephew but doesn\u2019t want her soon to be sil there enough to be willing to. Or the groom. Either way.", "Manipulate how?", "> We\u2019re supposed to be respecting boundaries nowadays.\n\nOP's boundary: a double standard is being applied to his sister and he wants to stand by her.\n\nWhere's the issue? There's a very good reason why the other 2 siblings so easily established that same boundary for themselves.", "I\u2019m sorry but this is just a stupid comment. \nI won\u2019t be explaining that again cause you and I have prolly different cultures and opinions."]}
