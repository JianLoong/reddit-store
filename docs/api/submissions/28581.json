I mean there are so many organizations that have expressed and talked how wrong that word is. You are so far from the jerk op. Your son is lucky you are standing up for him. I despise the R word and constantly have to ask people to not use that word around me because it is offensive especially since I have two sons with special needs. One having Autism. I have had people tell me it\u2019s okay for them to use it because they aren\u2019t talking to me which is wrong and nonsense and just makes me mad. It\u2019s  just awful that people are like that.

My son crawled under the table to avoid all the people (new place, tons of people, new smells, just overwhelmed), and K started laughing and drawing attention so that even other customers were looking.

Both my son and K deserve a good Christmas. \n\nI brought all this up privately, in person with her, with the expectation she'd talk to D and possibly K... she didn't. D found out days ago, and that's why she came up with the \"Christmas at moms house\" bs. She never told him.

But I have receipts so....\n\n\nThe rest of the family was told my experience, and that they're welcome to form their own opinions, I just want nothing to do with K. Literally everyone has taken my side; this is such a ridiculous situation. But I thought maybe if I laid it out, and a bunch of internet strangers all agree it's BS, maybe she'll see.
