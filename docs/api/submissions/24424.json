My wife is a beautiful person but with too kind of a heart. For some reason, she can never say no to her family and as of late has become a babysitter.  \nIt all started about 2 years ago when L's sister Q (28f) had her second child with her ex-BF, the pressure of being a single mom with 2 kids got to her, and being the kind older sister she is L decided to babysit. Now L had planned for this to be a one-time thing but over 2 years, it's become so frequent. Now I don't dislike my Nieces, but L and I for now are child-free and due to this have lost privacy of our own. Before anyone says anything, I don't mind watching the girls when it is important, but watching your kids so you can go on a week-long Vacay to Cancun in the middle of the year is insane, almost as insane as L and I taking them to daycare.  \n2 days ago Q dropped the girls off at our house again, she wanted to go to a party. I stopped her and gave her back her kids and told her, no. Wednesday is date night, and for the past month, it has been taken over by 2 cute adorable, crazy loud girls. I told her we have plans, she begged and pleaded and I told her no. Q leaves, and I go to the dry cleaners to pick up my stuff guess what I came back to, you guessed it, L with the girls. I ask L what happened and she says Q begged her, and she couldn't let her sister down. I told her tonight is date night, she said she knew. I asked her when was the last time we had a date night, and she said last week, I said without the screaming toddlers, and she looked puzzled. I'll tell you 4 months ago. When was the last time we had a vacation, she couldn't answer. We've put everything on hold just so that her sister can go party, vacations, and hook up with random guys.  \nI know these girls' teachers' names, allergies, and drama. I know about how one of them detests oranges, and the other wants a pet dog that they want to name Butterdash. I've watched their stupid cartoons with them when there's an issue in school who do you think they call not Q, it's us We are not their parents, their actual parent is off doing only God knows what. L replies she knows but she doesn't like seeing Q struggle, I told her to grow a fucking pair, her sister is using her, and has pretty much made her a parent to kids she didn't want, the girls weren't in the room for this conversation they were downstairs watching Owl House.  \nWe didn't speak and surprise surprise, Q doesn't pick the girls up till today, I feel bad for what I said but I also feel, more time is being put into these two girls than our own relationship, our wedding anniversary shouldn't be spent babysitting", "created_utc": 1691770909, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15odbgq/aita_for_telling_my_wife_to_grow_a_pair/", "score": 135, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You need to ask your wife why she cares more about not letting her sister down than letting you down.  Why are the needs of her sister being placed before the needs of your marriage?  It's clear you love these girl and your wife.  But you need to talk to your wife and make her understand that enough is enough.", "NTA.

She is most definitely using your wife as an on-call babysitter and it's affecting your marriage.  Enough would be enough for me on this one.  No more babysitting unless it is an actual emergency and I think the rule should be that BOTH of you have to agree since both of you are involved.", "NTA. It's time for things to change.

And by the time you get done parenting them....  you will be over your child rearing phase...all of what you had in you for kids, *your (our)kids* will have been drained away by your SIL and her selfish life style. So if your wife is okay with these girls being her kids, okay. \n\nThen you wait for her answer and see what she chooses. Her family or yours", "NTA.

It\u2019s absolutely fine to help out friends or family sometimes but this is beyond excessive. You\u2019re absolutely right she\u2019s being used. Could you have been kinder? Yes. But we\u2019re all human and I understand why you snapped. You weren\u2019t even saying no to babysitting, you were saying no to babysitting that night because you hadn\u2019t had any quality time with your wife in 4 months. This situation is not sustainable, it\u2019s going to hurt your marriage in an ugly way. Your wife is an asshole for not knowing/caring, or even REALIZING how much you miss her and how much it\u2019s affecting your relationship. Either she has blinders on or you come second in every situation and that isn\u2019t how it should work. \n\nIt\u2019s also very unhealthy for her to not have boundaries for her own sake. She needs to put her foot down for herself and for the sake of your marriage.\n\nI think in the meantime you should apologize for losing your temper and admit you were wrong for HOW you went about it, but you and L are overdue for a long heart to heart.", "You should have a more in-debt talk with her, calmly, and explain to her the things you\u2019d rather do with her than babysit. Explain to her that in a case of emergency you\u2019re still willing to babysit, but not as a substitute for daycare/school, and not for dates, parties and vacations. That that is not necessarily normal to do for family, no matter how much she loves her family. She can show her love in other ways, not by taking over as a parent. Good luck! NTA.", "INFO: Does your wife have other immediate family in the local area besides her sister? \n\nYou say that she can \u201cnever say know to her family\u201d, so I don\u2019t really know if this is an issue with  the sister, Q, or if her other relatives do similarly selfish things. If her other relatives don\u2019t do stuff like this, and are also in the area, then it may be worthwhile to reach out to them to see at least if Q is relinquishing her children solely to ya\u2019ll all the time or if she\u2019s inconveniencing multiple people. If she\u2019s inconvenienced multiple people, then there\u2019s power in numbers and you stand a better shot of getting actual change. \n\nI don\u2019t see that same change happening going forward if it\u2019s just you and your wife against Q. Q clearly has a hold on your wife, and has already shown she is willing to go around your boundaries. And, frankly, your wife isn\u2019t much better if ya\u2019ll have already had the conversation about not watching the kids so often\u2026.which I don\u2019t know that you actually have besides when you confronted her after this last time\u2026and she decided to do so anyways. Because she could\u2019ve said no too, regardless of her sister asking, but she didn\u2019t. \n\nOverall, I think you need to have a serious discussion with your wife about this as well as about the future. Because, from previous precedence\u2019s of stories like this on this site, what usually ends up happening is one of three things: the grandparents step up, the child/children get(s) taken by CPS, or another relative of the bio parent takes in the kids rather than let CPS take them and put them up for adoption. I highly suspect that, if the first option didn\u2019t happen, your wife would want to do option three, and it sounds like you are no way on board with that. \n\nThat is not to say that I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve done a good job of making the best out of a bad situation and trying to bond somewhat with the girls\u2026Butterdash is an awesome name by the way\u2026but I have concerns\u2026mainly because from how you talk about them, the girls, it makes me think you would have a hard time bonding with any non-bio kid. And that\u2019s okay\u2026you just need to know that up front. That being said, it would mean that, if your wife was all gung ho on option 3, I don\u2019t think your relationship would be beneficial to any party involved in the situation: not you, not your wife, and not your nieces. All that would result is resentment\u2026which is clearly already happening.\n\nAlso, before I forget, to go back to the original issue, despite asking for info instead, I do not think you were a jerk for what you said. I probably wouldn\u2019t have phrased it the exact way you were doing it but, at the same time, I completely understood what you were saying and thought it was something your wife needed to hear if she\u2019s serious about ya\u2019ll\u2019s relationship.", "Esh, your wife for being a doormat. \n\nYou for saying grow a pair. That was not the way to approach this subject with your wife. How would you feel if your wife said that to you? Would you be interested in actually listening what she had to say?\n\nSit down have an actual conversation. Discuss how you miss the romance. The date nights the vacations.", "YTA \n\nFor the way you worded it. She may be feeling pressure from both sides and be stuck in the middle. \n\nThe sister is an AH, so let\u2019s get that out of the way. \n\nYou\u2019re handling things correctly with her sister, but YOU may need to grow a pair and have an honest conversation with your wife. \n\nHave you talked to your wife about this? Why she feels obligated? To what extent is she willing to do this? Is she hurting or helping her sister, the kids, herself, you? How she thinks it\u2019s impacting her relationship with you? Where do her priorities lie? \n\nIf she can be honest, you\u2019ll have a better idea of whether or not your goals align.", "YTA because of how you spoke to your wife. I'm interested to know if you've had sit-down, civil conversations before you exploded at her. Now her sister is absolutely in the wrong and is awful for pushing off her children to you but you have to understand that you aren't the only one under stress here, so is your wife. Her sister chose to have kids and they are her responsibility. You are child free whether you chose that or not and she shouldn't be taking advantage of your wife like that. She sees you two as free babysitters because she thinks you don't have any responsibilities when in reality, you should be spending this time to help grow and develop your relationship and creating fond memories with each other. I think you need to apologize to your wife for exploding but then sit down and have a conversation about establishing boundaries with the sister. Also take some time before the conversation to think about your wife's motives for constantly accepting having to watch them. She's probably worried about where they would go if she says no. This could put them in vulnerable situations with strange men or home alone, etc. Just be careful about this and have a real conversation with your wife instead of a one off comment that clearly hurt her feelings. If you haven't, it may be time to talk about expectations for kids of your own. Maybe she wants kids and this is the only way she feels she can have any. I know that's a lot of maybes but it's worth trying to see her side and talking to her. I wish nothing but the best for you two and those little girls and hope you can all find a solution that's best for everyone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Besides that, OP clearly adores the kids so this \"concern\" seemingly comes out of nowhere to me.", "Sounds like they\u2019ve had plenty of conversations over the time this has been going on.  Being nice isn\u2019t working.", "Let me explain. Based on how he's written his post I don't think \"adore\" is the right term. He's clearly a good guy that realizes that the kids are innocent of being brought to their house and so he is treating them well by interacting with them and not making them feel like a burden, despite his own frustrations about the situation. But his emphasis on the fact that his own wife is  neglecting him and their relationship because they always are taking care of those kids, paints a different picture, one in which he has the potential to come to resent the kids, in addition to his wife, due to them being an obstacle in the relationship. And that is exactly how people that cannot bond with non-bio kids feel, and frankly leads to another concern that I didn't even bring up. \n\nHe says that they are child-free \"*for the time being\"* and emphasises the reason being so that they (he and his wife) can have their relationship and go on \"date nights\", etc. Whenever a guy uses the words \"child-free\" though it sort of throws my hackles up because do they just mean.... for now? Or, do they even want children at all? Most men I know that try and post pone having kids, despite wanting kids, do it for financial reasons, not for going on date nights and just enjoying the relationship. I'm not saying I cannot be wrong, but even if an unintentional pregnancy were to happen, and he and his wife would have their own kids, the end result, in my opinion, would be the same. Their bio kids would also become barriers to that type of freed up life from being \"child free\" and going on \"date nights\".\n\nAnd if that's the case, and he isn't being honest about that to himself or others, then that is going to cause issues down the road, ones that everyone involved will suffer for. First and foremost, due to the fact that his wife seems to take to motherhood by her willingness to watch the nieces, and also due to the fact of the likelihood of option 3 happening, from my previous comment, which is the one where the wife would want to adopt the nieces if it came down to it.", "Didn\u2019t sound like it to me.

You're not her legal guardians, you have no legal obligation.\n\nIf she doesn't pick them up, follow through.\n\nRemind your wife it's not just her time she's giving - it's yours as well. Her saying yes to her sister is saying no to her life and yours, and is letting you down. *She's prioritising her SISTER HAVING FUN over CELEBRATING HER MARRIAGE WITH YOU.\n\nTheyre both taking you for granted. The sister, taking care for granted. The wife, for your acceptance of it.\n\nIt's amazing you've stepped up and become solid role models for the girls, but you shouldn't have to when they have an able bodied parent.\n\nIf your SIL must require you to babysit, outside of emergencies, you should set a minimum amount of head's up time to lend a hand, like at least two week's notice. If it's shorter than that, either charge her money, or refuse (and call cops if she leaves them).\n\n###I would like to add: before you lay down the law hard, make sure to talk to the girls- let them know you love them, and they're not doing anything wrong, but you don't have time to see them as often. Even if sister doesn't talk you down to them for refusing, if they've established a routine with seeing you frequently, and that stops with no explanation? They can't help but feel that they messed up. Reassuring that it's not them, and not personal, will help your bond, may help them to their mother about not taking up your time, (\"muuuuum, uncle said he doesn't have time,\"), the abruptness would probably be harmful and negatively affect their self confidence.\n\n\nYou're a person, not a doormat. A brother in law, not the father of the kids. You've been doing her favours, but you're not a charity. She cannot refuse to care for her own children.\n\nAnd if your wife accepts- call the sister back, or leave the house whilst they're there. You had plans to go for dinner? Eat out by yourself. Go see the movie. Her choice if she sends kids back and joins or stays back to babysit.\n\nYour wife is a sweetheart, needing a wake-up call. An iron fist in a velvet glove- be firm and clear with your boundaries, but don't insult or hurt her", "NTA. She really needs to set some boundaries with her sister. Single parent doesn't mean going out whenever you want, having someone else take the kids to school and going on vacation without the kids. Single parent here. All my vacations were with my kid. The only times I went out of town without him was for work. They were 3 day trips and seemed to last forever. \n\nYou need to have a good talk with your wife and let her know how her constantly putting her sister and nieces ahead of you makes you feel. She needs to know what it is doing to your marriage. Do not give her an ultimatum. Those never work out when it comes to family. \n\nTry to come up with a solution,. Maybe she doesn't take the nieces for two weeks. Make her sister take care of taking them to and from daycare. This way, it gives you both a total break from them for a bit. Then, maybe she watches them one night every other week. The only exception would be emergencies. Make her take her kids with her on vacation. \n\nYou also need to have the daycare take your information off their records. Your sister in law needs to make sure that is taken care of.", "Some of these comments are very harsh towards your wife.  It's not about \"growing a pair\" (BTW she already has them, they are just internal :).   To me, it doesn't sound like she is purposely sabotaging \"date night\".  She feels bad for her nieces and wants to provide them what their own mother/father are not.  That doesn't make her a bad/weak person.\n\nAnyway, I think the term you are looking for is \"appropriate boundaries\".  Maybe your wife (and her family) never had clear relationship boundaries, and this is why she finds it hard to say no.  I'm so glad these girls have both of you!!!  They clearly love you and you have provided them consistency that their parents have been unable to so far.   Not sure why you are childless, and it really doesn't matter as long as you and your wife are on the same page about this (are you???).  \n\nATEOTD, these children did not ask to be born to shitty parents.  Is it your fault?  No.  But do you have some obligation to them?  I would say maybe.  Does Q's behavior rise to the level or child protective services involvement? (Abandonment, neglect?)  You and your wife may want to talk about the \"WHAT IF?\" scenarios.  Are you both willing to step up to parent these babies if needed?", "Not being able to pay for rent or food is a \u201cstruggle\u201d Not being able to go out when you want to is called being a parent.", "NTA. I also want to adopt a dog just so I can name them Butterdash."]}
