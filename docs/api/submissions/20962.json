If by that, you mean the death penalty, I highly suggest revising that viewpoint. Currently, if a monster wants to SA a child, they SA them and then leave (generalized statement), because if they kill the child they know the penalty is more severe, so they let the child live. \n\nIf all sexual abusers are sentenced to death, it gives the monster incentive to kill the child as well, because either way it\u2019s the same punishment: Death.\n\nI agree that the consequences for many sex crimes is too lighthearted, some don\u2019t even get jail time.", "Yikes!

I've read a few papers about language acquisition in infants and toddlers and obviously there's a consensus about speaking to them like they're \"adults,\" or at least older than they are. But a few papers/studies have discussed the benefits of *having conversations* with babies. They point out that if you speak to them like you're having a conversation, even if they can't fully participate, you teach them the rhythms, cadences, and patterns that are involved in the language you're teaching them.\n\nIt used to be thought that repeating words to children until they \"get it\" was how to teach language, but that's more or less been disproven. In my own professional experience, children can and do repeat words they've heard, but usually (again, in my experience) it's like they're sampling the flavor of the word and trying to see how it \"tastes\" when they say it. But I'd say that the children I've worked with have benefitted from how I speak to them.

Probably not.\n\nBottom line being, how can you be mad at yoga lady who doesn't respect OP's son's boundaries and feelings and in the same thought infer that OP's wife is a bad guy for expressing her honest feelings?
