So MIL regularly tries to force one on her, which invariably makes 3yo scream.

Consent applies to children when it comes to hugging.", "NTA And let's  hope she never had kids", "NTA you respect your child's right to consent to be touched. If you forced your child to hug her, then you would be the AH. Children deserve respect just as much as adults. Well done for standing up for your child and advocating for him.

That's one of the great middle-class cliches; the unwanted display of familial affection from an overbearing auntie. Comedians use it in their stand-up routines. You see it on TV all the time. It made me realize that the boundary wasn't where I thought it was; that society had normalized something inappropriate. Not in so many words, of course; I was like ten at the time. \n\nBut here's the thing: \"the time\" was around 1982. So this wasn't some new thing being pushed by the \"woke mob\" - forty years ago, kids were being taught bodily autonomy and personal boundaries in school. \n\nBut some parents just don't like their kids telling them \"no.\"", "She was put out that the son was 'disobeying' her.

If they say no, I offer a high five if they don't wanna do that, I wave. I get very annoyed when my brother and sister-in-law encourage them to hug me even after they have said no.
