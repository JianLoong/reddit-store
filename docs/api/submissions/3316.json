{"id": 3316, "submission_id": "z5k5yz", "title": "AITA For Not Paying An Artist The Full Amount She's Asking?", "selftext": "So here's the story:\n\nI was commissioning a $50 piece of an OTP I ship from a cartoon I watch. It was just an SFW picture of the ships fully clothed in bed. It is a little steamy, as one girl is on top of the other girl and they're pretty clearly in a major lip lock and blushing as they're doing it. So I ask an artist to make this piece and she says its possible for her to make the piece. She says that she typically takes 50% of the payment before and 50% after. So I agree and send her $25. A few days go by and she sends me a FULLY COMPLETED picture of the two girls I asked for lying next to each other in bed. Pretty obviously what I DIDN'T ask for. I tell her this and she says that she's not comfortable drawing what I asked for in terms of them being in the positions they are. I ask her why she didn't just tell me that at the beginning of the commission and she says she needed money, so she was willing to take what she could get. So I asked her to change it to what I asked so I would be satisfied with her drawing. She said no and then told me to send the remainder of the payment. I told her I would NOT be doing that unless she did as I asked and send me an altered picture of what I originally asked for.\n\nI'm not gonna ask her to send me back the $25 I initially sent as she still did do half of what I wanted, but I'm not gonna send her the other half of the $50 if I'm not satisfied with the final piece. She told me that I was scamming money from her and that I had to send her the last of the money. But I'm adamant about not sending her money unless I feel satisfied with the service she provided. And as she only did half of what I asked, I feel only half satisfied. I understand not everybody is comfortable drawing what I asked with one person being on top of the other, but I feel it's not unreasonable to not send her full payment if I'm not satisfied with her work.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1669502437, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5k5yz/aita_for_not_paying_an_artist_the_full_amount/", "score": 679, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When I wanted to commission a drawing of a transformer to the specifications of a kid in my clinic as a gift when he got his kidney, she said that her friend was better at that kind of thing and turned the commission over to them. The kid was thrilled, so I was pleased, and my daughter didn't take on something she would not have enjoyed, and her friend who did need the commission was paid a fair wage for her work.", "Every artist I've commissioned from has either had it on their commission sheet or told me up front what they are and are not comfortable with. If I asked someone to make a drawing of my cat and they sent back a drawing of someone else's cat I wouldn't pay them either.", "299-northstar: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think I will.\u201d", "I\u2019ve heard stories of prostitutes giving a client his money back, that\u2019s got to sting worse then taking the money and running as you would assume in that case they\u2019re just scammers. But giving the money back basically saying you look or smell so bad that I won\u2019t touch you even if you paid me.", "I\u2019ve given money back when there\u2019s been a miscommunication about what they were looking for/what I provide, or on a couple occasions when I felt ill and couldn\u2019t complete the session (I have diabetes and Crohn\u2019s, it occasionally happens). I try to be clear that it\u2019s nothing against them, it\u2019s either a miscommunication or a me issue. But yeah, it probably stings, and I do feel bad, even if it\u2019s the least-bad option.\n\nBut if someone gets violent or aggressive or continues to do something I don\u2019t like after I ask them to stop (first politely, then sharply, unless it\u2019s something really egregious and then I go straight to sharply) then I kick them out. No refunds. And I don\u2019t feel bad about that.", "NTA. I'm an artist who works off commissions. She didn't do what you asked her to do, and was pretty blatant about it. She's even admitted she lied to you in order to get the cash and was never willing to do it the way you wanted it. You're under no obligation at all to pay her the balance.", "NTA", "NTA. As someone who also does commissions, she\u2019s certainly the scammer here. She should\u2019ve been upfront and you guys could\u2019ve compromised for a lower price. She played you and herself.", "NTA\n\nSend her back the picture with confirmation of delivery and a separate communication requesting a refund. I'd also go so far as to leave a review that although the artist is skilled, request for commissioned pieces are accepted for monetary gain when the artist has no intention of fulfilling the contract and still demands payment.", "NTA- I'd have reversed the charge on my card. She lied AND gave you something you didn't request. And who is that uncomfortable at fully clothed romantic cuddling?  I mean,  I think that is what you requested.", "NTA. SHE said YOU were scamming when they admitted they never intended to make the promised item? Nope.", "Shut UP TROLL. Elaborate or go away NTA Op.", "They are t allowed to take payment tho I assume. Otherwise that\u2019s just a scam"]}
