{"id": 3316, "submission_id": "z5k5yz", "title": "AITA For Not Paying An Artist The Full Amount She's Asking?", "selftext": "So here's the story:\n\nI was commissioning a $50 piece of an OTP I ship from a cartoon I watch. It was just an SFW picture of the ships fully clothed in bed. It is a little steamy, as one girl is on top of the other girl and they're pretty clearly in a major lip lock and blushing as they're doing it. So I ask an artist to make this piece and she says its possible for her to make the piece. She says that she typically takes 50% of the payment before and 50% after. So I agree and send her $25. A few days go by and she sends me a FULLY COMPLETED picture of the two girls I asked for lying next to each other in bed. Pretty obviously what I DIDN'T ask for. I tell her this and she says that she's not comfortable drawing what I asked for in terms of them being in the positions they are. I ask her why she didn't just tell me that at the beginning of the commission and she says she needed money, so she was willing to take what she could get. So I asked her to change it to what I asked so I would be satisfied with her drawing. She said no and then told me to send the remainder of the payment. I told her I would NOT be doing that unless she did as I asked and send me an altered picture of what I originally asked for.\n\nI'm not gonna ask her to send me back the $25 I initially sent as she still did do half of what I wanted, but I'm not gonna send her the other half of the $50 if I'm not satisfied with the final piece. She told me that I was scamming money from her and that I had to send her the last of the money. But I'm adamant about not sending her money unless I feel satisfied with the service she provided. And as she only did half of what I asked, I feel only half satisfied. I understand not everybody is comfortable drawing what I asked with one person being on top of the other, but I feel it's not unreasonable to not send her full payment if I'm not satisfied with her work.\n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1669502437, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z5k5yz/aita_for_not_paying_an_artist_the_full_amount/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were paying for a custom piece of art and she did not provide it. It's not even that you're \"not satisfied\" she literally didn't give you what you wanted. It's like ordering a pizza and being given a calzone instead. She should have turned down this job if she wasn't comfortable doing it. And even if she thought she could do it initially and had a change of heart she could have messaged you and asked if you would accept an alternative piece of art.", "NTA, if anyone is scamming it's her. She admitted to taking a job she wouldn't complete because she \"needed the money.\" Don't pay her anything more if she's not going to give you what you asked for.", "NTA. I'm someone who has done a fair amount of commission work, and all artists should tell commissioners up-front if they're comfortable drawing the requested subject matter or not, even if they need the money. From what you've described, it sounds like she made a piece entirely different from what you requested, and it's not reasonable to force someone to pay for something they didn't even ask for. She should've told you beforehand what she was comfortable drawing so you two could've compromised.", "LMAO the absolute nerve to take your money and then go \"awe gee actually I'm not comfortable with doing the very thing you hired me to do \\*shrug\\* Oh well! now pay me the rest you owe me for that thing I didn't do!\" Cheeky bastard!\n\nHahahahaha. NTA. She's lucky you even gave her the 25 dollars. I'm usually very defensive of artists and their commissions, but this one just is a no from me.", "NTA - and you aren\u2019t scamming the artist. They were trying to scam you. She knew when she took the commission that she had no intention of drawing what you asked for. She\u2019s lucky you aren\u2019t making a fuss about getting your deposit back.", "NTA, the artist did not complete the contract. They did not submit the artwork you asked for, so therefore they are not entitled to full payment. You sound reasonable, submitting full payment once the agreed upon services are rendered. The artist should have declined the work and given you your money back if they had such objections. ETA: honestly I think you\u2019d have a good case to get your $25 back but I probably would let it go bc it wouldn\u2019t be worth the hassle.", "NTA she went into it intending to scam you.", "When I read the title I thought that you would be an asshole but nope, not even a tiny bit. She scammed you pure and simple. NTA. And I'd be requesting a refund of the deposit from whatever platform you used. If it was something like etsy I'm sure they will sort it, especially if you use the messages as evidence.", "NTA - she didn't provide you with the service she promised and then called you a scammer? I'd be livid", "NTA\n\nI'd also leave a review stating that she ok'd your commission, took half the money, and only then told you that she wouldn't draw what you wanted and tried to hit you up for the rest. She is not professional and this is probably not the first time she's pulled this.", "NTA\n\n\u201cshe needed the money\u201d\n\nshe says you scammed her. she knew she wasn\u2019t going to do what you asked and still took your money.\n\nshe should have been upfront.", "NTA\n\nShe scammed you.\n\nShe accepted your deposit knowing she was not going to create what you asked for. Did not communicate that to you. Then did what she wanted to do and had nerve to ask for the rest of the money.\n\nDon't give her another dime. Block her.", "NTA she didn\u2019t deliver what was agreed upon.  If she wasn\u2019t going to do the job she was commissioned to she should have passed on it.", "NTA! If anything, she is the scammer. If she didn't feel \"comfortable\" drawing what you asked for, then she should've turned down your offer. Dont pay her the remaining money, AND she owes you your money back.", "NTA.  If this was commissioned through a site or a contract was signed I would advise reading the fine print about your options and obligations.  OP's not the AH here, but there may be additional considerations.  If it was a less formal thing no done through any particular site, I'd say hold firm.  The artist should have been upfront about their unwillingness to make the piece they were paid to.", "NTA. She tried to scam you; if she wasn't comfortable she shouldn't have told you she couldn't do it. I would not send her the remaining money.", "NTA, don't send her shit. \n\nIf I ask someone to set up a stone pathway for my patio and they did it in wood tile they ain't getting paid until its done right.\n\nSimple transaction logic dude. You want product A for 50 dollars, she gave you product B. She doesn't get agreed upon payment when she didn't deliver product A.", "NTA, and ask for your down payment back. She knew she wasn\u2019t going to do what you asked when she took the job, so she got your $25 under false pretenses", "NTA \n\nShe owes you a refund. She did not complete the commission as asked; she did her own version. You owe her nothing because she refuses to do the piece you asked for and she agreed to.", "NTA\n\nShe accepted your order under false pretences, with no intention of completing it as you requested.", "NTA.\n\nUsually I\u2019m all about supporting artist, but what she did was fraudulent. If you don\u2019t want to draw the commission, don\u2019t take the commission. \n\nYou don\u2019t do the job in the way you want it and then demand full payment.", "NTA. She did not complete the piece you ordered so you owe her nothing", "NTA you would be even within your rights to return the picture and receive your $25 back - as the work wasn't what you asked for. But the way artist is acting she wouldn't agree so that would be hassle.", "NTA You set the terms and made it clear what you wanted, she agreed with no intention of delivering.\n\nNot paying her the second half isn't enough. You really should try to get the downpayment back because what she did is absolutely not acceptable, she basically scammed you. If she wasn't comfortable with your request she should have declined, end of story.", "NTA, you didn't get what you paid for.  \n She should have given you your money back. She knew she wasn't gonna do what you want, yet she kept the money and wants more?

I wouldn\u2019t display what you describe at any place I\u2019ve worked. If you mean no nudity, say that. SFW is a pretty useless term, really. I\u2019ve had friends work for porn websites.

Her reputation isn't going to be very good if she keeps this up, which as an artist is very important. \nAnd if she was strapped for money as she says she was, she would've done a drawing even if she wasn't comfortable with it. Her saying she'd do something, and giving you something completely different is or is at least a kin to fraud. At the very least she was scummy for doing this, and should do the original drawing or refund your money, but I would not pay her a dime more and move on. If anything, write an honest review that while you love her artwork she did this to you and you won't ever trust to buy from her again.
