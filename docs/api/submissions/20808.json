This could at least show some initiative in your agreement to let him in your home.", "Dave sounds like my husband, or my husband's attitude for a while. My husband didn't want ANY ole' job, it had to be one up to his standards.  \n\nI told him, in no uncertain terms, that my job alone could not pay for our house mortgage and taxes, insurance, and all the utility bills we have together.

Or he has a very serious mental illness", "I find it amusing that it\u2019s  a good reason for his wife to leave but not a good enough reason for the sibling to opt out.\n\nI know someone who lost his job because the journal he worked for was going out of print. Had months of notice to line up new work. Months to figure out cheaper living arrangements and trim expenses. He did nothing. Made a cursory search for jobs and refused work that he was qualified for because he wouldn\u2019t be paid for seniority he did\u2019t have.  Eventually non-payment of rent caught up to him. Since he was a long-term tenant, landlord worked with him for months to work something out. Landlord told him he\u2019d have to start the eviction process and did he understand what that meant if the process was completed? Got evicted and had to be forcibly removed. Prevailed upon a friend for a temporary place to stay. Used the address to apply for temp work and tried to establish legal presence at his friend\u2019s. Got evicted again. Turned down men\u2019s homeless shelter and work rehabilitation program because the work was too menial. Was able to maintain temp work based on previous address but went to a homeless shelter. Has been living out of the shelter and doing the same temp work for the last 3 years. \n\nThis long-winded story is your brother\u2019s future. You don\u2019t need to have a hand in delaying the inevitable\n\nNTA", "Salary doesn't determine his worth as a human being, but if he's going to insist on using that as a metric, right now Dave is worth $0. And literally anything is going to look better on a resume than a giant three year gap where the only explanation \"my pride/inferiority complex was calling the shots.\"\n\nYou're NTA. \n\nIf he ends up homeless, this is a deliberate choice that he is making. And not letting him drag you down there with him needs to be your choice.", "NTA the family is just looking for someone to blame about the situation that they dont want to take accountability for.", "That argument might\u2019ve made sense for, like, a month. It\u2019s been 3 years.", "Also he\u2019s quite possibly not worth the same anyway if he hasn\u2019t been keeping his skills up and keeping up with the industry and advancements in the roles he wants.", "He\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t call the cops and report the car stolen.", "Ops brother is also hurting himself because when they see a huge gap in employment, they want to know why and a lot of places may not want to hire him.", "it's being petty, he isn't going to find a job while homeless there is basically no chance of that. OP is choosing to let the brother suffer the consequences of fucking up and seems to be a whinny ****** about their family not being happy about that. Like yeah no shit the family aren't happy, OP you need to deal with that and not go complaining on an internet forum. It's not like difficult to see why they would rather you help him out. You don't have to do anything you don't want to but there's going to be consequences. A lot of them will remain pissed off at you and might think you are a bit of prick, you just gotta either make peace with that or get your brother some help.", "right now it's impossible to be hired in the same status he was, the way is search for anything to start geting on his feet again, there is no shame on starting over at the bottom", "Obviously, just that his excuses are stupid and make no sense", "I've never heard of this saying before...huh", "OP might well find themselves estranged from a lot of their family over this tho, and personally I will find it very funny.", "but I'm only saying facts, not that I agree with them", "My hubby is an avionics tech. He left defence, then covid hit, and planes stopped flying, which meant no one was hiring because they could do flight maintenance on a skeleton staff. My hubby went into traffic control and then construction. When the planes started flying and companies started hiring again, he bumped into an old co-worker who asked if he was interested in getting back into avionics, and hubby sent his resume. That co-worker got him through the resume phase, but hubby still had to prove himself in the interview phase (it helped that the company had had their eye on hubbys old team and had been hoping to poach them to the private sector pre covid anyway).\n. It was a couple of years doing traffic control and construction that set him apart from the other applicants because 1 he didn't sit around waiting during covid, he got off his butt and was willing to do anything to stay busy and of those two jobs he did do, one of them taught him to be flexible with his thinking and has taught him new ways to look at problems which has already helped in his first year back in aviation.\n\nOPs brother needs to stop thinking his resume alone is going to be enough to get him a job and he needs to start looking at other options that can help him get to his goal otherways.\n\nAs for OPs question, NTA especially as OP noted that everyone who is calling them TA aren't stepping up to offer their beds and couches because they know Dave is just going to freeload", "He might have been very well paid for his experience and position for his old job though. \n\nAnd thinks that it works like if you still have that job.\n\n\nIt does not though", "If dude is in such a bad place that he has lost his *wife* and his *house* then he's 98% in the mindset of \"everyone else's fault\" and that's possibly in the blaming wheelhouse.", "It wouldn't be much of a loss if the family does that. If the 42 year old was willing to let his wife and home go because of his ego, then he deserves everything he gets and the rest of the family deserves there karma too.", "UPS has the ninjas around here. FedEx actually comes up and rings the doorbell. With UPS, I actually have to either refresh the tracking info or constantly look outside to see if they've shown up.", "Last time they tried the run up and stick a delivery notice to the door before the delivery window I called there customer service and told them if I didn't get the package delivered in the specified delivery window then I was calling Amazon to report the contractor. Not only did I get the package less than 20 minutes later I got an apology call from a manager.", "maybe but OP just sounds annoying complaining about it, actions have consequences, they can choose to not help their immediate family because they think the brother is in the wrong that's fine, but I really don't see the point of complaining about the family being pissed off at that on Reddit. What fucking else did they expect?", "Least they chucked it at your door... They've left packages at the end of my driveway, it's 1/16th of a mile long next to a busy highway.  Somehow we haven't lost anything yet.  Our local USPS is the worst by far, if they have a package to deliver to the door but don't want to?  They'll leave the \"sorry we missed you\" card in the box so we have to go to town and get it.", "Some common sense maybe.", "It might be time to get a second Ring to yell at them through XD", "This happened to me this morning. My Amazon package said delivered and the image included definitely was not my front porch. Took me a minute to realize it was an odd shot of the garage door on the other side of my house. Pretty sure they were standing in my bushes to get that angle.", "Where in the hell did I say any of that? Reading comprehension is cool. If you have the means to take time off and enjoy your life, no one is paying your way.", "Oh, I can comprehend you just fine. Thanks for checking! You responded to someone\u2019s comment that unless you\u2019re one of the most privileged, people have to work, \u201cadvanced bootlicking.\u201d \n\nThen you tried backpedaling. \n\nInsulting the intelligence of people who explain why work is necessary is no substitute for wit or debate.", "I left a really toxic job once - I gave notice but I did not have another job lined up. When I was honest during interviews, no one liked that. Then I started to tell people I had to relocate because my partner got his dream job, people LOVED that and I started getting offers...", "Fed Ex delivers my stuff...to other people's homes.  Gets the signature and everything.\n\nDecompose in Hades, Fed Ex.  Where are my shoes?", "What ended up happening to your sister?  Did she have the wake-up call she needed and get it together?  I have a sibling who I definitely believe will put me in this position one day.", "She kind of has it together but yeah, she had to hit rock bottom.  I turned her down, she ended up getting some help from another relative that just ate up money.  Always full of big ideas, and she never did the work to get there.  \n\n20 years plus she's still indigent. But we are still talking and wouldn't be if I'd taken her in.  \n\nShe very much is of the mindset well I had a house once I will again but doesn't get that she needs to work.  Not spend every cent thay comes her way.  That sometimes you can't take a vacation even if you really need one.", "She didn\u2019t say the pride comment to him. She suggested he apply to work at UPS which is a good idea. She\u2019s fine at her job.", "Mine still lives at home and refuses to work because she doesn't feel she can physically.  The doctors can't find anything wrong.  I feel for her for that and wonder if it's mental health.  She refuses to accept that it might be mental health related and won't get evaluated. But she also doesn't really get that when you want something, you have to work for it.  She's put my parents in a horrible position.  Everyone loves her, but if you're well enough to go with your friends and suddenly too ill when it comes time to do the important stuff like applying for job, getting everything in order to get a job, and lay around and sleep all day every day, no shame hitting up everyone in the family for money because of no motivation to try, completely irresponsible, etc., I feel like it's a serious problem.  I truly wonder if she even cares.  Our family panics that she will ruin her life, but she is calm and cool.  I don't want her to end up homeless one day, but at this point, I think she will.  She's extremely lucky she has my parents and what they've put up with over the past eight months.  It's an excuse for everything.  She takes nothing seriously.  She's already asked to live with me when I first got a house, and I quickly said no.  No one even knows what to do at this point.  Speaking to her has not worked.", "It's so frustrating. Very similar situation with my parents but eventually my sister burned that bridge too.  To the extent she didn't even attend our father's funeral.", "Wow.  That's terrible.  I'm so scared for what the future will bring at this point.  It will create, if it hasn't already, a lot of resentment in the family.  I hate that she watches my parents and other sibling go work their asses off every day and thinks there's no issue.  My parents should be thinking about retirement, not how they will have to work until they're dead to support her.  She's been very selfish.", "I ordered 4 boxes of 6' long rubber landscape edging, 6 pieces per box. Each box weighed just shy of 50 pounds, and was, of course, 6' tall. I can pick up 50 pounds, but when the object is several inches taller than me, it becomes a challenge. Fedex guy delivered them to my neighbor. Thankfully he left them at the bottom of their stairs (they have outdoor stairs to their front door that are about 10 feet up from the sidewalk). Even more thankfully, a (different) neighbor came by while I was dragging the dead weight into my yard and helped me carry them not only to my house, but through the house and to the back yard where they belonged (my plan was to unpack the boxes and carry 2-3 pieces into the back yard at a time, which I could manage solo).\n\nIn a weird twist, that guy would deliver almost all their packages to my house because I don't have outdoor stairs like they do. It was a clear case of \"whatever I can do to do the least work possible without getting fired...deliver light things to the place with fewer stairs, deliver heavy thing to the place with lots of stairs in a way that no one's camera will catch me!\"\n\nOur UPS guy is solid gold, though! He once found me while walking my dog to hand me a package when I told him through my doorbell to leave it, I was just up the street walking my dog and would be back shortly. \"A few seconds to prevent a package theft is time well spent!\" He also walked an 8x10' area rug to my back door when I wasn't home and delivered my grill to my back door even though I was home because he \"could see it was a grill and would go in the back yard.\" I've also seen him help people carry heavy packages into their homes (most of us have half a flight of stairs just inside our front door...only my immediate neighbors have moved theirs outdoors)."]}
