He is homeless because he chooses to be.  \n\nWork and pay your bills and have a wife and house OR do nothing and be homeless.\n\nHe had options.  He doesn't get to pick 'don't work and freeload off my unwilling relative'. \n\nFor what it is worth I've been in a similar situation with my sister but years ago and did not let her move in.  With perspective that comes with time it most certainly the right decision for both of us.", "NTA.  Dave made his choices and that includes not working.  He's looking to freeload off you. He's NEVER going to get a job as long as somebody is taking care of him.  The family can either offer to let him live with them or back the hell off.  Don't give in - you'll never get rid of him.", "NTA since he can\u2019t pay his bills and is getting foreclosed on I\u2019d say his current worth is 0. So any job is a step up. He did this to himself because his ego won\u2019t let him earn less. Less is still more than nothing. Tell your family that you can\u2019t support him when he did this too himself but they are all free to take him in.", "NTA. Dave knows what he needs to do in order to not be homeless.", "NTA - Dave is either an idiot or isn't giving the whole story about why he doesn't have a job. His logic about salary negotiations went out the window about 6 months (maybe a year because of COVID) after he got laid off. He now has a 3 year gap on his resume with no explanation beyond stubbornness. \n\nTell your brother that your family members (whoever is giving you a hard time) are very concerned about his situation and he should reach out to them for a place to stay.", "NTA, the ones who disagree can take him themselves", "NTA. Stick to your guns. You get to set the rules. He needs to have a job before he moves in and he needs to have a plan and a move out date in place before he sets foot in your house. At any point he is unemployed while living in your home, he has X number of days to move out. That will help you get rid of the freeloader. Many states have tenancy laws making it difficult to throw someone out once they have taken up residency in your home. In some cases you need to go through the entire eviction process. Can you imagine what your family members would think of you then? BTW,  Don\u2019t forget to indicate what bills he\u2019s responsible for and what chores you expect. If he wants someone to cook and clean for him in needs to move back in with his mother.", "NTA", "NTA. He needs to get his head out of his ass and get a job. Tell your family members that Dave will be happy to hear that they are allowing him to live with them.", "NTA - Might hurt him in the salary negotiation process? He knows he doesn\u2019t HAVE to tell a potential employer that he\u2019s currently employed? He already has a gap in his resume. He\u2019s lazy.", "NTA - You are NOT allowing your brother to be homeless.  It is entirely HIS DECISION.  You are under no obligation to provide free room and board for him!  You presented a reasonable option for him to have a place HE REFUSED!  \n\nIf your family is upset, ask them \"So why don't you let him stay with you?\"  \n\nThen ask your brother, \"How is you plan working for you?  Lost a job, a marriage, and a home, doesn't seem to be panning out?\"", "NTA it's your house, but as someone who really struggled to become less reclusive after Covid, I think there might be more to it, and your brother might need serious help.", "NTA. Brother has a bad case of denial, (in truth, he'll never make what he did) that wasn't penetrated by even the threat of losing his own home. He had plenty of time during that process to swallow his pride, take any job and save his home. He chose not to. Also, if he had totally identified with his job his ego could have taken such a blow that he's in a state of depression. Still, only he can fix himself. Hopefully, he'll get help", "YOU didn\u2019t \u201callow\u201d your brother to be homeless. HE made that choice. Period", "Im sorry but after three years out of work, a divorce and a foreclosure Dave\u2019s not worth anything anymore so he really should accept the fact that noones gonna pay him a lot.", "NTA- Let's take a quick count of what he's lost: \n\n1. His wife\n2. His house\n3. His pride\n4. His relationship with you\n5. Likely, more possessions than you know about\n6. His mind\n\nOf all the things he hasn't lost, his dignity. He's chosen this hill to be homeless on. Your family should pick up his slack and not be butthurt that you won't. Your family = TA as well. You've made good choices, OP.", "NTA\nI used to work at our county welfare department. I remember a man who was holding out for a high paying job. I suggested he apply to UPS. He said no, he was too good to work at UPS. I remember thinking to myself \u201cyou\u2019re too proud to work at UPS but you\u2019re not to proud to apply for welfare?\u201d Your brother appears to have a similar attitude. He\u2019s too proud to take just any job, but he\u2019s not too proud to mooch off of you. Don\u2019t let him. With his attitude, he may never find a job, and may never move out if you let him move in.", ">Dave is still stubbornly interesting he\u2019s not working for less than he\u2019s worth\n\nHe's being paid exactly what he's worth at this point. Seriously, any job is better than no job, and your stipulation is very reasonable.

My income was literally a third of his, I told him he could stay here, he ate all my food, then he tried to tell me I would have to go without so he could borrow money for cigarettes and I laughed in his face and explained why that isn\u2019t going to happen, he woke me up all night long going in and out in and out to smoke cigarettes, I\u2019m fairly certain he smoked inside when I was at work even though it\u2019s absolutely prohibited by me and my landlord, and after two weeks I woke up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night and I found out he had taken my car after I specifically told him he was not allowed to drive my car especially not in the middle of the night. And I\u2019m kind of grateful he did that because it gave me an excuse to kick him out. I couldn\u2019t tolerate him being here waking me up all night eating all my food not contributing anything, he would clean but I don\u2019t need a housewife.", "Yeah I\u2019m not sure why he thinks taking a low pay job means that sets his new pay rate when his current pay rate is zero."]}
