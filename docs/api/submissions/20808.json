This could at least show some initiative in your agreement to let him in your home.", "Dave sounds like my husband, or my husband's attitude for a while. My husband didn't want ANY ole' job, it had to be one up to his standards.  \n\nI told him, in no uncertain terms, that my job alone could not pay for our house mortgage and taxes, insurance, and all the utility bills we have together. I told him that MANY times and finally got so angry I told him that if he didn't get ANY job that he would be living with his sister in her 1 bedroom apartment. \n\nHe has a seasonal job the first half of each year.

So he\u2019s not taking another job until he finds one that pays like his old job did.\n\nThis is ridiculous.

If you allowed him to move in, he would never work and never leave.\n\n>My family members are on me about how could I allow Dave to be homeless but I don\u2019t see anyone else offering their spare rooms and couches to Dave.\n\nThis should be your standard response. \"I'm glad you're so concerned. Dave is lucky to have you! When are you letting him move in?\"", "Re: a job that pays less, beggars can\u2019t be choosers.\n\nRe: your family who accuse you of letting Dave go homeless, since they\u2019re very concerned, suggest they make room in their lives for Dave so he won\u2019t become homeless.", "NTA\n\n1) You're not allowing your brother to be homeless. He is choosing to be homeless.\n2) Supporting someone's bad choices is codependence, not love.\n3) A 3 year gap in employment, and now bad credit, is a much worse look than a lower paying job.\n\nOne key thing though is *how* you communicate this to him. \"Fine, be homeless?\" Feels a lot different than \"Hey man I love you, but I think you're making choices that are hurting you and I can't be part of it.", "NTA...Is dave aware of what he's actually worth with no job and home foreclosure?", "NTA - Your house, your rules. (This is also how someone ends up being permanently out of work for the rest of their life.) Dave is going to have to suck it up and just get an effing job, or be homeless (or live - freeload - off someone else).", "NTA. He is unemployed because he has some other kind of hangup which he is hiding behind arrogance. Absolutely do not get financially entangled with him.", "NTA.\nHe is a 42 year old man. You're not wrong for deciding not to baby him, and certainly not wrong for expecting him to get a job.\nIf your family members are so upset about poor Dave's situation, they can house him. You don't have to.", "If he\u2019s not willing to get a job to have free housing, he\u2019s about a lazy of an AH as I\u2019ve seen on here. NTA", "OP's brother would be a perfect fit as a UPS Driver; he doesn't have a wife to come home late to anymore!", "Plus UPS jobs pay very well (at least in the US) and they get a ton of overtime plus great benefits and  pension.", "Tell your family members if they feel so strongly about this, then they should offer up their house, I\u2019m sure they will give excuses for NOT doing it.", "Once he's moved in, it'll be very difficult to kick him out.", "having welfare shouldn\u2019t be shameful and I don\u2019t know how someone could work at the welfare office and be shaming people coming to collect? Now I think YTA lol", "And to your family members, yeah if they have a problem with Dave being homeless then they are welcome to invite him to live off of them.", "You forgot, he also lost his savings", "Yes. That gap of unemployment is a red flag to employers and will make it a lot harder to get another job.. especially one that pays what he thinks he's worth.. which in reality isn't much. He's not worth enough to work those lower paying jobs. Apparently his wife(ex) doesn't think he's worth it to be with. The lender to the home doesn't think he's worth working with to keep his home. And OP doesn't think he's worth dealing with. \n\nOP stating that he just gets a part time job is more than fair.. it's actually overly generous. So yeah, homelessness is on the brother. OPs family need to find a way to support the brother if they're so concerned. OP doesn't have to and never has to support any siblings in any way. That's the parents deal. They made him. Technically, parents don't have to support their children when they are adults, but because they brought this up it's on them again.", "u/kaludiasays...I agree with most of what you said, except the part about 6 months to find \"acceptable\" work. Dave has already had **3 years** to find work. Yes, I understand he wants a job that's \"up to his standards\". However.....ANY job(s) at this time are better than none. \n\nIf I was Dave's family, I would not allow him to live in my house without an existing job because he's already proven that he's a freeloader. He's used up all his savings to pay for his expenses up to this point. There isn't any indication that he would do any differently in his brother's home.", "I disagree with your assessment of the previous comment. People who CAN work and choose not to should be shamed for applying to get subsidies. It's all about attitude. \n\nThat's a totally different mindset than the person who comes in and is working day labor jobs, applying everywhere they can to get a stable income and may need interim help until that happens. Those folks can take my tax dollars any day of the week.", "You\u2019re missing the point. The commenter isn\u2019t shaming welfare, but the fact is that there is a stigma associated with welfare. So if someone is willing to have the stigma of being on welfare, but doesn\u2019t want the stigma of having a low paying job, that says something about them. They\u2019re not thinking logically or like an adult, and it looks like they just want handouts.", "I think you should be ashamed if you're on welfare and are perfectly able to work but don't wanna. It's fine to take if you need help between jobs but not instead of a job.", "I agree that there should be no shame in needing help and welfare. However thinking that one is \"too good for\" or \"above\" a job is a shamefull attitude to have. I think everyone should want to provide for themselves rather than living off of tax payers money if they have the ability, health and chance to do so. This is comming from a Scandinavian socialist btw. I am all for helping those who need it.", "He probably also doesn't realize that employers look at gaps like this and often ask what someone did in that time (hoping to hear like, volunteer work or anything else productive) and all he'll have to say for it is that he couldn't get a job.\n\nHe is setting his own worth at zero, and the longer he waits to work again, the less he'll actually be worth to any future employer.", "I\u2019m a skeptical person too, so I do think it would serve as a bit of a test, too. Is he willing to walk the walk if it\u2019s a path towards the work he wants when given a \u201cclean\u201d slate? although i know not all jobs lend themself to this. (for example, i don\u2019t have a full time job right now but I have part time work at the rate I would normally charge. it\u2019s not enough but i\u2019m at least being paid what i\u2019m worth for the small amount of work i\u2019m doing)", "if you\u2019re working at the welfare office I\u2019d assume you\u2019d be more professional is all I was implying. Obviously OP from the story is NTA", "Another Scandinavian socialist chiming in here. I've been on welfare for a while because of mental health and difficulties finding a job, but I've always applied for anything I could. Now I'm getting off welfare, taking an education in healthcare and getting a job. But I have former friends who just freeloads on the system and they REALLY grinds my gears", "Exactly. If someone has a decent employment history, gets laid off, and immediately starts delivering pizzas while looking for a better job, future employers don't say 'I'm not hiring a pizza delivery guy'. They say oh yeah, this person paid their bills.  Good on them.", "The commenter didn't say anything, he had a thought that he kept to himself. Nothing unprofessional about it."]}
