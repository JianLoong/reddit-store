This could at least show some initiative in your agreement to let him in your home.", "Dave sounds like my husband, or my husband's attitude for a while. My husband didn't want ANY ole' job, it had to be one up to his standards.  \n\nI told him, in no uncertain terms, that my job alone could not pay for our house mortgage and taxes, insurance, and all the utility bills we have together.
