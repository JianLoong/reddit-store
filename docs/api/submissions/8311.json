Because you make both people drive to get to your place for one to be disappointed and drive there for no reason. Selling online is shit, I agree. I've done it many times. But I would never line up two buyers at the same time. If the first one doesn't show up, then you text the next. \n\nFrom the buyers perspective,  I live far out of town. A 2 hour round trip from the city. If I find something online, shedule a time and start driving, but get a message that the item is gone by the time I get to town I would be pissed. Of course the first guy is an ass for being late, but things happen and if he had to organise a trailer etc, he could be running late. That's why I went with everybody's shitty. \n\nFor people to say never hire a trailer before getting the item. They certainly don't live far out of town. I don't do the trip twice to pick something up secound hand. Why would I waste time and fuel to go twice? That's why you ask for more pictures and talk to the buyer. If in the end you don't like it, you can still refuse to buy, but otherwise being prepared safes so much hassle. And you don't have to put a deposit down that doesn't even count for some people.

You sold something to the highest bidder.", "INFO:  Was he only coming to *look* at it, like a maybe? Or had he intended to buy it, to which you had agreed and then reneged? \nBecause NTA if it's the former.  YTA if it's the latter, in which case the only way to fix it is to give half the bonus 300 to the dude which would still put you 150 extra ahead, cover his costs/time and level your karma after having broken your word.", " NTA", "not your problem.  nta.", "First come, first serve, NTA", "How long was it between \u201cI\u2019ll be there in an hour\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m 20 minutes away?\u201d  NTA I\u2019m just curious", "NTA.  Who wouldn't sell to the first full price buyer?  I understand the disappointment of the second buyer but he was a dollar short and an hour late.  That's on him.", "Yeah, he was already offering $300 less, I bet he would have showed up with $500 less than asking and said that's all he had.", "Second buyer drove three hours but I only found that out when he arrived, first buyer was unknown.", "> him to be getting aggressive\n\nThat's because he low-balled you and was going to resell it t a profit.", "He was low balling because you said it needed to be moved ASAP.", "Gotcha.", "Just so you know, he was never planning on showing up on time.  This is a common MO for scummy people buying things\n\nSay you offer something for $2000, \n\nHe says \"I can give you $1700\", and when he shows up he only has $1500 on him, take it or leave it.\n\nHe shows up with a trailer and says \"I had to rent this trailer and drive two hours to get here, you should knock $100 of the price\"\n\nAnd on top of all those things, he tells you he'll meet you at 10:30 but changes at the last minute to be later.  He was always planning on showing up later, he is just hoping that you have to sit around for a couple of hours getting annoyed so that you're more likely to take his lowball offer \"just to get rid of the thing\".\n\nHe's angry because the above didn't work.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  I wouldn't be surprised if he was lying about getting the trailer and being \"on his way\".

Online selling is a pain in the butt and he likely knew he was risking not getting the thing by being late. And it's not your fault even if he did hire a trailer. But it's pretty likely he knew someone with a trailer, so I doubt. We know at least three people who we borrow trailers from, and sometimes people borrow ours. It's how it works.", "NTA - You snooze, you lose. It\u2019s his fault for being late.", "That's because those people are looking to re-sell it.", "The only people who should be strung along like that are scammers."]}
