He was low balling you with his offer and then late.", "NTA. You sold it to the highest bidder and go your price which is exactly what you want. The other buyer offered less, so you would have waited for the second buyer to make his offer anyway.", "NTA, he wasted his own time stopping to pick up the trailer, which is probably what made him late.", "NTA. \nBet he would have turned up 2 hours late, nickel and dimed ya then asked to borrow your trailer", "NTA\n\nWhile he was probably late because he was renting a trailer, he was still an hour late.

He expects you to sit around for an hour and turn away someone who is willing to pay full price that is right there when they are supposed to be? No way. He's late, that's on him.

This happened to me before. Misunderstanding when selling some furniture on Craigslist so the original person I had promised the piece of furniture to didn't get it. He was also really pissed and sent me a nasty message.\n\nSorry to the original buyer. That's kinda just the reality of selling things online to strangers. Both buyers and sellers are super flaky and you can't count on anything until you either have it in your hand, or have it out of your hand.", "NTA he should have showed up on time.", "YTA.  The time to tell him the deal is off is when he told you he was going to be late.  You wanted to keep him as a backup in case buyer 2 didn\u2019t buy it.  Buyer 1 communicated with you that he was running late.  He didn\u2019t just ghost you.", "I did think that. I thought he also may have just said that to make me feel bad for not selling it to him.", "That\u2019s what I thought\u2026 it just made me think for him to be getting aggressive that I may have done something wrong.

I remember it being a dark and empty parking lot.\n\nBut apparently 2 teenage girls also wanted the puppy and were riding their bikes that same morning and got stopped by a cop that questioned why they were out that early. The cop apparently felt so bad thinking he was the one that stopped the teenage girls from getting this puppy that he told the pound what happened and they gave it to that family instead.\n\nI was heartbroken. \n\nI just remember that story everytime i hear about first come first serve.", "2nd buyer also drove three hours to look at it and was 15 minutes early.", "I have a feeling that\u2019s what happened.", "In any case, if you say there is a second buyer coming, you should know there is a risk of them getting the machine. Could be that he just likes the nose of the second buyer better, he doesn't have to obey by any conditions to whom he wants to sell (fcfs or best).", "I hadn\u2019t told him that it was best offer or fcfs. Although surely it\u2019d be best offer on something if he was trying to offer me $300 less than the amount I wanted and I was very clear I had other potential buyers lined up on the same day. He had also organised with me on Tuesday to come look at it Thursday, I said fine but if it sells before hand I would let him know as to not waste his time, his response was \u2018cool!\u2019", "Yeah, like I said if he was aware that it could sell before he got there it\u2019s his bad. I don\u2019t think this is your fault in any way shape or form, just trying to help show his point of view. I do understand him being upset, that\u2019s a natural thing to feel, but taking it out on you like that wasn\u2019t the appropriate response."]}
