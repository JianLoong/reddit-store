Have you two discussed what chores must be done and how often or are they open for discussion? Just saying since often it's the case that one person thinks their way is the only way and the other has to go by it. It rarely works out in the long run if there isn't room compromise or at least a healthy discussion. Many people think their level of cleanliness is right, from slobs to neat freaks, and that anything less is being a slob and more is excessive.  And it can vary per chore. Open discussion about what people want to be done and what chores they like to do or find important can help balance things out, of course in the process making sure nobody gets an unfair workload.\n\n Metawork is definitely a chore and it's often overlooked by the ones that don't do it, but it can also be taken advantage of. Once saw an excel where one part got equal chore points for discussing meeting up with friends as the other got for dishes, or got nearly the same amount of points for planning what to pack for a kindergarten kids back pack every day as the other got for actually packing said bag and dressing the kid etc. Funny enough this excel was published in a paper as a great example of how to divide chores correctly. one party basically did mostly thinking, decisions and communication with friends and family while the other was left with the large majority of the actual chores.", "NTA, but I\u2019m really not sure what future this relationship has.

We rarely have to spend the whole hour getting done daily what needs to be done with four of us working on them. It allows for variety and choice that feels less like your being forced to do something, and it doesn't put a specific burden on any one person to do the lions share of the chores. Everyone also has a cheat day, they can choose to use it on any day, so if someone is having a bad day, or just tired from work, school or lack of motivation that day they get the time to decompress and shed responsibility for that day, but it has to be made up on their day off. \n\nWe made the chore chart together, it helps all parties understand the expectations, it helps all parties get what they need to make it work, and again it feels less like something you're being forced to do, and more like something your doing as a team to support the team. \n\nIf he wants a list have him sit down with you and create the list so he has something invested in it as well, he will be more likely to engage in a list he helped create, than a list handed to him. \n\nGood luck", "NTA and do not allow him to do this.

Ideally you won't have to teach him forever. If you feel like he is still not really caring to do things right after a while, you can then split up.
