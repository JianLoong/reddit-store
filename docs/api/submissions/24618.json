Have you two discussed what chores must be done and how often or are they open for discussion? Just saying since often it's the case that one person thinks their way is the only way and the other has to go by it. It rarely works out in the long run if there isn't room compromise or at least a healthy discussion. Many people think their level of cleanliness is right, from slobs to neat freaks, and that anything less is being a slob and more is excessive.  And it can vary per chore. Open discussion about what people want to be done and what chores they like to do or find important can help balance things out, of course in the process making sure nobody gets an unfair workload.\n\n Metawork is definitely a chore and it's often overlooked by the ones that don't do it, but it can also be taken advantage of. Once saw an excel where one part got equal chore points for discussing meeting up with friends as the other got for dishes, or got nearly the same amount of points for planning what to pack for a kindergarten kids back pack every day as the other got for actually packing said bag and dressing the kid etc. Funny enough this excel was published in a paper as a great example of how to divide chores correctly. one party basically did mostly thinking, decisions and communication with friends and family while the other was left with the large majority of the actual chores.", "NTA, but I\u2019m really not sure what future this relationship has.

We rarely have to spend the whole hour getting done daily what needs to be done with four of us working on them. It allows for variety and choice that feels less like your being forced to do something, and it doesn't put a specific burden on any one person to do the lions share of the chores. Everyone also has a cheat day, they can choose to use it on any day, so if someone is having a bad day, or just tired from work, school or lack of motivation that day they get the time to decompress and shed responsibility for that day, but it has to be made up on their day off. \n\nWe made the chore chart together, it helps all parties understand the expectations, it helps all parties get what they need to make it work, and again it feels less like something you're being forced to do, and more like something your doing as a team to support the team. \n\nIf he wants a list have him sit down with you and create the list so he has something invested in it as well, he will be more likely to engage in a list he helped create, than a list handed to him. \n\nGood luck", "NTA and do not allow him to do this.

I live with a partner who used to make me feel absolutely awful whenever I failed to get a task absolutely perfect or, if, say, the kitchen or the bathroom was getting dirty and I failed to clean it yet. I have to say, this DOES NOT help us. We don't need to be approached with negativity or accusations whenever we fail to do things perfectly, as long as we are open to learning and improving. It sounds to me that the guy is willing to learn and just needs a little bit of help at the beginning. I don't think the 40/60 thing is fair... You share the house, you split the chores 50/50. Ideally you won't have to teach him forever. If you feel like he is still not really caring to do things right after a while, you can then split up.

In order to get his buy in I let him choose the chores he preferred, as long as we ended up with the same level of effort. I didn't care which ones I did, and he had stronger preferences. I then proceeded to give him no advice about his chores.  I don't care as long as they're done. Luckily, he wasn't enough of a jerk to just not do them. Since we jointly agreed on what an equal division of labor looked like it helped us realize how much work it took to be in an equitable relationship (plot twist, more than you think). We don't need a chore chart anymore because we both know what it feels like to pull our equal share. I recommend this method to everyone now.

Who wants their partner to think they're incompetent? I don't get how the strategy works in their minds? Like do they really think we can see them as selectively stupid about housework and not generally stupid? That they can behave like a whiny 8 year old all damn day, and we'll still somehow think they're hot that night. We should respect their judgment as an equal partner, but accept that they're totally not lying when they say they don't understand how a vacuum cleaner works. They giving us a choice between thinking they're less competent than an 8 year old or that they're liars. How is this supposed to work for them? Great! You got out of 20 minutes of housework, but your wife's skin crawls when you touch her now. This is not a smart tradeoff.", "As the girlfriend of a man who\u2019s parent also did everything for him and also was a bit of a dumb dumb when it came to housework- you\u2019re all good my guy, it\u2019s the effort to improve that matters!! \ud83e\udd0c", "...late 90s?

This one happens to be where he moved in to her place but still wiping a dirty table is not something that needs to be told by the person who lived there longer. And it is a personality flaw most guys have. I moved into my ex-husband\u2019s house (where he lived during his previous marriage then after his divorce a with his kids). But once i moved in, it was \u201ci\u2019d do it if you told me or asked me to do it\u201d. It sounds biased because of my experience but this happens all the time regardless of who moved where.

Yes, there can be a splitting of domains along gender lines, which is it\u2019s own thing, but just as every driver should fill their own gas tank without being asked, everyone should put dirty dishes they helped generate in the dish washer without being asked.

There is something dirty. Not worth noticing because someone will come and fix it and the next time you see it it is clean. \n\nI never was spoiled like that. I was lazy af though. But my mother never cleaned up my messes so when I \"didn't see\" something being dirty it remained dirty until it was so dirty even I could see it. Then I had to clean it and it was harder to clean because it was already dirtier than it should've been. Because of that I now see immediately if something is dirty and cleaning it is so much easier if done immediately.", "Ugh.

I'd imagine he will end up doing a lot more than 60% of the physical chores then! He'll quickly learn how much mental load it is to have to treat him like a baby due to his weaponized incompetence, and then have another conversation about how you could both take on half of the mental load and half of the physical.

It's so frustrating how many men do this - \"I'll help, just tell me what to do\" is only acceptable if you're a guest at somebody's place and offering to help them in a place *you don't live in*. If I'm going to be their manager, I'm not going to then do their tasks with them, after I've worked out what needs to be done and given them a list. And even if I am their manager, my staff don't come up to me and go \"Job done, what's next?\": staff that aren't 15 years old know that they have several tasks that they have to complete every x days or weeks or whenever they need to be done.
