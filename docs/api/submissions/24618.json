Have you two discussed what chores must be done and how often or are they open for discussion? Just saying since often it's the case that one person thinks their way is the only way and the other has to go by it. It rarely works out in the long run if there isn't room compromise or at least a healthy discussion. Many people think their level of cleanliness is right, from slobs to neat freaks, and that anything less is being a slob and more is excessive.  And it can vary per chore. Open discussion about what people want to be done and what chores they like to do or find important can help balance things out, of course in the process making sure nobody gets an unfair workload.\n\n Metawork is definitely a chore and it's often overlooked by the ones that don't do it, but it can also be taken advantage of. Once saw an excel where one part got equal chore points for discussing meeting up with friends as the other got for dishes, or got nearly the same amount of points for planning what to pack for a kindergarten kids back pack every day as the other got for actually packing said bag and dressing the kid etc. Funny enough this excel was published in a paper as a great example of how to divide chores correctly. one party basically did mostly thinking, decisions and communication with friends and family while the other was left with the large majority of the actual chores.", "NTA, but I\u2019m really not sure what future this relationship has.

And even if I did phrase it like that, he might wipe the crumbs on the floor because I didn't specifically tell him that they should go in the trash.", "I think you're confusing men with \"people who were raised in a barn.\" Most adult men do know that a dirty, sticky table should be wiped down before one eats at it.", "This. I feel like the initial table setting incident was a simple misunderstanding. I took it as some game pieces or maybe the game box still on one end of the table while he was setting up dinner on the other end. Totally normal to leave some stuff on one end of the table if it\u2019s just a couple eating dinner on the other end, I leave paperwork/mail on the table as I set it for dinner when it\u2019s just me and my spouse. No big deal. OP seemed to blow that incident out of proportion and as a way to get some petty revenge against him she starts micromanaging and giving him more chores. \u201cManaging\u201d the household chores counts as work now? Come on it\u2019s chores not a Fortune 500 company. This couple\u2019s lack of communication is sending it downhill fast.", "Except THINKING about chores IS a chore. Communication is a chore - and a time consuming one. I was a PA for a while and 70% of my job was planning and communication, before getting things out into action.", "He hasn't really talked about chores at all, and has had no problem with the frequency of these tasks. I think I'm very middle of the road when it comes to cleanliness. \n\nSocialising is not a thing I've counted as a 'chore'. Just the things inside the house. I thought him doing 10% more in return for me carrying the responsibility and being aware of everything seemed fair.", "I edited my original post to elaborate, but it wasn't just 'some stuff to the side', it was sticky from spilled drinks and there was barely room to eat. \n\nI'm not looking for revenge, I just can't imagine spending as much time doing chores, while managing his chores on top of that. I'd like him to ideally share half of these responsibilities, but if he doesn't want to / can't do that, I think it's fair he takes on more chores.", "60/40 because he doesn't expect me to teach him, he expects me to point out and tell him every single thing that must be done around the house, indefinitely. That means the responsibility is only on me, because I either didn't do something or I didn't tell him to do something. And that means I need to be aware of everything going on in the house at all times. That's not fair to expect of a partner and to expect 50/50 chores on top of that.", "Look up Fair Play deck and book. \n\nAnd add \u201cmake chore list\u201d, \u201cmanage chores\u201d, and probably \u201cmake meal list\u201d, \u201cgrocery shopping list\u201d, etc to the list of chores, then give yourself fifty percent, including all the mental tasks you listed. Don\u2019t let them stay invisible!", "Please consider this is hard wired into him through his parents or grandparents or whoever his caregivers were doing everything for him.  You will not be able to retrain him.  You will either have to pay for a cleaning service or end up doing 90% of the housework every night after your day job.  Unless he is very good looking and funny, in that case keep him around while you search for a better man.", "I\u2019m a mother and even I refuse to mollycoddle my teens. His mom trained him wrong. \nHe\u2019s 26! Ask him to use his brain cells otherwise you will be his mama all his life. \nThe only exception if he\u2019s diagnosed functioning autistic. I have a family member like that who truly cannot understand so his mom created a basic step list. Using your table example setting table means \u201c clear mess off table, wipe off table, put tablecloth , lay plates and silverware, keep water/ juice glasses ready\u201d\nAnd he uses this template every time. But also he\u2019s a under 15. \nIf you have to tell an adult all of this then your 60:40 division of labor is fair", "Honestly, you're both being immature about this. You were NTA until you started insisting he should pull 60% because you made a list. Some of the best relationship advice I ever got was that both partners should try and do 70% of what needs to be done. Granted, this is tougher with someone that can't even wipe off a table but when both of you are trying to pawn off some of your share on the other it's a recipe for resentment.", "One you have looked into weaponised incompetence and mental load, ensure you share it with your BF. And make sure he reads it, and understands it. If he still disagrees, then you have your answer for how the rest of your relationship will pan out and you\u2019ll have a decision to make\u2026", "What he is doing is called weaponized incompetence. He knew damn well that he should *at minimum* clear the damn table before it could be set. Unless he is a legitimate imbecile, this is completely unacceptable. NTA", "I cant believe the solution was for him to have his whole fucking apartment rather than shaping up and doing his chores.\n\nI mean I can believe it. But I cant believe that i can believe it.", "Well I hope OP would have connected the dots if he was. I used to live with a guy whose girlfriend broke up with him over the state of the main shower (I had an ensuite).", "There are some things that can get a little aggregous, like using more than 5 squares of toilet paper or me clearing my throat too loud (I was choking on water).", "OP replied to the same comment you replied to, saying that the table was sticky and gross. Crumbs, pens, paper, dice, empty cans, nearly no room to actually sit and eat dinner. \n\nAnd yeah, managing the household can count as a chore. It's the whole mental load aspect of it. There's a comic that people have linked to in other comments (I don't have the link myself) called The Mental Load that explains it pretty well. Basically, being the one who has to manage all this stuff can put a lot of mental stress on a person.", "I mean you\u2019re right but: \n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/qO2HYlDVpq", "That's what I said no? But there needs to be a balance. In the excel I referred to things that take a lot of time and effort to do were equal or badly balanced with tasks that really don't take much time or effort. Like the backpack example, for a kid that age the effort of planning what is packed can't possibly amount to the same amount of points as actually packing the backpack and getting the kid ready. Or having a conversation with a friend shouldn't be the same as more demanding physical chores. Planning is work but so is work, if half of a couple is doing all the work the other can't possibly spend a similar amount of time and effort on just planning these things. well of course if they both feel it's okay than it is, but often this is a way to resentment.\n\nI plan for a living, but I wouldn't dream of telling someone spending time and physical effort for example an hour or two that me setting pretty much the same plan for his work with small modifications is equal to his effort. I can literally plan what 12 workers do in a week in less than a day. \n\nFor that reason I think a cut like op did is probably about fair, but it's left for them to decide what they feel is fair.", "In my opinion it may totally be fair. He probably doesn't want to discuss or think of these things but there still probably should be a discussion to avoid resentment. Most of my comment was just in general and not really meant towards your case. I think often people get too into who's right and who's wrong instead of trying to find a way to work as a team with rules or divisions they can both be happy with. And yeah men most often don't care, or want to do, discuss or plan these things. \nThis seems to be the case with your relationship as well. He needs to see the value of you planning these things, but again he should realize a discussion would probably be in his best interest too. Not saying your division is wrong in any way, but just that he feels heard, otherwise even if he doesn't seem to care, in the long run it may lead to arguments that could have been avoided. If he isn't willing to have that discussion calmly and share his point of view he doesn't really have a leg to stand on when complaining about how you plan them.", "this is the best answer", "Haha lol", "\u201cKeep him around while you Look for a better man\u201d dear god I really hope you don\u2019t have SO and if you do they should leave bc you obviously look for other partners while committed to one which is wrong. You either break up and go find one or stick with the one you got.", "It's not for making a list. It's for him expecting me to always be aware of everything that needs to be done and instruct him, in everything that doesn't have a 'set' schedule.", "The mental load(not just making a list) accounts for about 30-50% of household labour. (depending on size of home, pets, kids, etc). Giving him only 10% more on chores is still generous.", "But you used the phrase \u2018actual chores\u2019. And obviously your job is important, because otherwise they wouldn\u2019t pay you to do it. If one person has to do ALL the planning in order for anything to get done, I think it is fair that they get a lot less physical jobs to do. Cos personally my ADHD self finds carrying out a list of tasks a LOT easier than drawing up a list of tasks and keeping all that in my head. Although the sad truth is I would just do everything myself because I am terrible at delegating.", "So I have had to reflect on this with my marriage. My wife\u2019s therapist suggested a whiteboard. However the whiteboard isn\u2019t to be unitarily filled out by my wife. We both need to write stuff on it within columns ME / WIFE. I need to make an effort to do so. I have severe ADHD where my actions can vary dependent on how bad my attention deficit is and now we\u2019re in the steps of getting help for me. \n\nPoint is I have an issue that I want to solve. I am actively working with my wife to solve it. Kinda sounds like this is a division problem not a team solving problem. Im also married though and not dating this person. Not sure if that matters. \n\nI could be over simplifying what you\u2019re saying too like he doesn\u2019t do the most common sense things? Like take out the trash if it\u2019s too full without you asking cause that\u2019s BS and I would say NTA."]}
