This has just happened within the past hour.\nFor a bit of context.\nI 24F met my fianc\u00e9 25M (FH for Future Hubby) in 2021. MIL and FIL are alcoholics and drug addicts.\nWith that said, let us start the first of many posts I will be making about this family.\n\nThis year I just found out that my twin sister  24F got diagnosed with breast cancer. We had made plans to visit my family over in Mexico to see her on the  25th-30th of December for 5 days. His mother had just called me and is now trying to get me to cancel my plans because \u201cIt\u2019s not fair that we see my family more over the holidays and she feels insulted.\u201d I have not seen my family since 2020 and this will be the first time FH meets them in person. We are also planning on getting engaged while in Mexico. We are leaving tomorrow to visit his family on the 23rd and 24th of December 2023 His mother decided to wait until the day before we leave to tell me that her plans changed. She is now hosting Chrismas on the 24-25 and expected us to be there since we already RSVPed yes. I tried telling her the situation, that we would be leaving at 6 am Christmas Day to take our flight over to Mexico. She started screaming at me over the phone telling me that I\u2019m an ungrateful asshole and that we RSVPed yes so we can\u2019t change our plans now when she's been waiting so long to see us. (we live 2 hours away from her and until recently we used to go there every weekend) I\u2019m not sure what to do, FH is at work and I'm home with our pets. I\u2019m usually a non-confrontational person but this has hurt my feelings. She has just insulted me once again and expecting to get her way. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the asshole for making the plans with my family but that\u2019s what she\u2019s making me feel like. while writing this post, she and her sisters began sending me nasty texts all about how I'm a horrible person for \u201crefusing FH to see his family\u201d\n\nhe\u2019s been in low contact with her for a while because she\u2019s like this. \n\nThank you for reading! I will be online all day to hear any suggestions and to see if I am the AH.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014UPDATE\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFH just came home for lunch, apparently, MIl has been spam-calling him since she and I spoke. She is saying that I was the aggressor, she started her crocodile tears and spun the story to make her the victim luckily Mil and her sisters had sent me some horrible texts that I could show him. He is appalled by this behaviour, We still plan on going to Mil\u2019s since SIL is going to watch our pets, we had made the decision wir would stay at Sil\u2019s for our visit instead of staying at Mil\u2019s and Fil. Even though she has taken to FB to call me out for stealing her son (again) after this holiday season we are finally going to No contact. Thank you all for your advice and I am glad I am not in the wrong I will update you on the 31st if any of you are interested. I will also respond to any Private messages I receive before tomorrow.

She pulled this stunt deliberately as a power play. There's a reason you fiance went lc with her. And he should be standing up to her now. Your sister is your priority now. Good luck to her, and to you.", "NTA.  You rsvped for a specific date, not a commitment to her whims. She's being unreasonable.  \n\nShe probably is going through you because he's low contact with her already and thinks she can manipulate you easier with guilt and bullying.  \n\nIf you can send him a text without disturbing his work, give him a heads up via text that his mother is pressuring you to change your plans.  She probably tried to pressure him first. \n\nGo visit your family,  see your sister and get engaged.", "Your RSVP was contingent on the ORIGINAL date she planned to host.

Next year I will do the same unless you adjust how you are speaking to me and speak to me in a respectful tone. \n\nI was diagnosed with the BRCA (breast cancer) gene last year. Just had a double mastectomy. Please get tested for BRCA. Even if you don\u2019t have the surgeries now there are much better ways to detect cancer now.", "NTA start setting stiff boundaries", "You are definitely NTA.\n\nRemain calm and respectful when speaking with/texting her but set your boundaries and hold your ground.\n\nIf you give in to her now, she will expect you to give in always.

She changed it so that voids the agreement.  Why are you even giving her space in your head?", ">we RSVPed yes so we can\u2019t change our plans now\n\nYou RSVP'd *for the original dates*. She is the ones who changed the plans *knowing* you had other plans. This was intentional to try to force you to choose her over your family.\n\n>he\u2019s been low contact with her for a while because she\u2019s like this.\n\nTime to switch to *no* contact, imo", "NTA\n\nCalmly state, \"We RSVPed for the 23rd and 24th.

You didn't agree to come to an event held on a floating date.", "NTA. First of all, RSVPs are for a given date, so she doesn't have any kind of etiquette grounds here (of that matters to you). Second, feel free to just block her. Like you don't have to take her bullying", "NTA\nI think you are about to find out how the rest of your life will go with her as a MIL. Your FH really needs to step up or I would reconsider the relationship. You also should visit r/JUSTNOMIL , lots of great advice found there.", "Block all their numbers.

This sounds like you're giving mixed signals", "NTA.  You absolutely can change your plans, and should in this case.

You made plans already. Your MIL can pound sand.", "NTA - she changed the dates, you didn't RSVP for those dates. Based on the way she's been treating you, I'm not sure why you and FH would still plan to go to her house.\n\nYou and FH will need to be on the same page about how to handle his mother, your FMIL.

Find someone else to take care of them ASAP.", "NTA. I get having to do it after Christmas because your SIL is watching the dogs, but honestly I would try to see if you can find another sitter last minute.

He has to ha dle it, cut contact, change your numbers etc. \n\nBoundaries are your best friend.", "So sorry you are going through this stress. Of course you should not cancel your trip, sadly i myself am familiar with this \"whose family is more important\" game at holidays. My mil is nowhere near as aggressive as yours, but there has been plenty of whining and pouting (and even some mild sabotage) so i know how hard it is to deal with. But she knows that she doesn't get away with that stuff with me, and my husband has also become amazing at shutting it down right away. \n\nBut they do test boundaries a lot before they understand it gets them nowhere. If you go over there before christmas, do be careful about attempts to sabotage your trip since its so close. It could be a sudden \"emergency\". Or more guilttripping. Or trying to get you to sleep in and miss the flight. People like this are willing to go pretty far in getting their way since the whole point is to show you who's boss this time and set the rules for the future. So be careful and i hope you have a wonderful reunion with your family!", "Lamento mucho lo de tu hermana Op, espero que ella recupere pronto su salud, es bueno que vayas a verla porque seguramente esta asustada y el apoyo familiar le vendra muy bien, por supuesto que eres NTA, tu suegra est\u00e1 totalmente equivocada.", "NTA.

No contact is the only thing that\u2019s going to save your sanity. I\u2019d suggest skipping their house altogether this year. She\u2019s going to cause drama and try to sabotage your trip. If you have someone else that can take your pets I\u2019d suggest not leaving them with his family.  Also if the rsvp comes back up you rsvp\u2019d for the original dates. Not the changed dates. Your original plans can\u2019t be changed. That\u2019s on her for changing, not you. Go see your sister.", "You\u2019re so NTA. Best wishes for you and FH. I hope that things get better for your sister. I have a feeling that FH and you will be going no contact with his parents in the future. Sorry about that, it always sucks when the most disrespectful and biggest problems in your life are family. Hope you guys have a wonderful holiday.", "NTA. You are hella brave for even going, especially if you have already reached the decision to go no contact. I would have just gone seen SIL and left it at that.\n\nOh and also...seriously it's not a horrible thing for you to visit your ill sister and your family for christmas considering it's been so long since you have seen them. It's not a competition on who spends what time with whom at christmas. You don't have an allocation of how many hours each person gets. Plus if there is a yearly allocation she gets to have hers evenly distributed  whereas your family have to have them in bulk", "NTA it's good your FH supports you too and can see how toxic his mom is.

Just do it now.", "you RSVP'd to her ORIGINAL plans. you did not agree to her new plan, however. she's trying to make you feel guilty and blame you for the problems she's causing. she's infringing on your time. she's just hoping to convince you you're the one who ruined the gathering. she abandoned the plan. she decided to try and manipulate you. most definitely NTA.

Sounds like you got a good in FH.", "NTA, and would love updates!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would drop the pets over SIL's house and **not go over 'MIL's' house.**\n\n***WATCH out that MIL does NOT rip up your tickets & passports so you can't go on the trip,***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou didn't RSVP b/c she changed the date.\n\nSorry to hear about your sister. She is the most important one to see now.", "NTA. But why would you go at all. I\u2019d say have fun, but I doubt you will. I hope the second half of your family trip is better.", "NTA \n\nyou know your SIL is going to cancel pets sitting at the last minute. Prepare a back up plan now.", "\"We are leaving tomorrow to visit his family on the 23rd and 24th of December 2023 His mother decided to wait until the day before we leave to tell me that *her plans changed*. She is now hosting Chrismas on the 24-25 and expected us to be there since we already RSVPed yes.\"  **You** had plans to leave for Mexico on the 25th. You didn't agree to her changed dates. **NTA** Safe travels to see your family in Mexico.", "I have a hard time believing you really can't tell if you're TA or not in this situation.", "NTA!! As a breast cancer survivor, I\u2019m telling you, your sister needs all the support she can get right now, so your trip home to Mexico is the first priority!! I would go NC right now, I wouldn\u2019t wait after the holiday season, and would find an alternative plan for the pets (wouldn\u2019t trust SIL\u2026).", "I would start the no contact now. Your FMIL is a classic narcissist\u2026 always the victim, never the villain.", "Get a new pet sitter, just in case MIL decides to follow SIL over to your house. Lock up inside the house as though you will have unwanted company, especially all valuables. Maybe invest in some security cameras.\n\nEdit: NTA", "!updateme", "Seriously, don\u2019t do this to yourself OP. Speaking as someone who was perpetually the middle man between hubs and his family, it will only lead to pain. No matter how hard you try. It eventually blew up in my face in epic proportions, no matter how hard I tried, and is still a point of contention.  I couldn\u2019t make EVERYONE happy, therefore the family problems must be my fault. \n\nIf they\u2019re not willing to speak and manage their own family relationships, there\u2019s no reason for you to get in the middle. Don\u2019t light yourself on fire to keep someone else warm. No matter how much they mean to you.", "You're gonna go NC after Christmas? Yeah, that will teach her. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nIn all seriousness, you're doing absolutely nothing here but being a doormat. Even if you don't know it she's does and she's treating you accordingly.", "Avoid the rush, go no contact now. Seriously, why on earth would you subject yourself even one more time to this lunatic?\n\nDrop off the animals separately, but do not visit MIL.", "Go visit your family, OP. Your FH deserves to meet them!", "Stop answering the phone. This way she can not say you said anything.", "No. Just text her that, then leave it. If she calls and yells, hang iPhone immediately. She seems the type to just keep shouting so you can\u2019t respond. If she does it twice in a row then text you\u2019re blocking her for failure to treat you with respect.", "You RSVP'd to the original plans. Not every and all changed plans from here to eternity. That is not how RSVP works.", "I have never tried screaming, crying and and swearing at someone to attend my Christmas party, but that's a very interesting tactic! NTA. Was she yelling racist epithets while telling you you were cordially invited to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ chez Mil?", "Honestly I would tell her you will no longer accept phone calls from her so you can have a text paper trail\u2026 I\u2019d also not be alone in a room with her either so she doesn\u2019t spread lies about interactions with you.", "Tbh, I wouldn\u2019t trust your SIL to watch your pets. I would find someone else. Who knows if they would get \u201clost\u201d or \u201cpoisoned\u201d or \u201cstarved\u201d.", "To be very honest... why aren't you going NC *now*? I'd trust some random guy off the street to watch my pets vs. your in-laws. \n\nUnless you ***seriously*** trust your SIL, I'd find a different way for their care, and then... just cut them off. Be done. Not \"They go to him from now on\", you ***actually*** go Full No Contact, and have a much happier life.", "I don't understand why you wouldn't go NC right now.\n\nWhat's the point of spending some miserable days there? Will that make you and your spouse happy?", "Personally I think I can get where OP is coming from with that. First, they have to take their pets to SIL bc she's watching them while they're in Mexico. Secondly, they're likely not going just for MIL -- there will be other family and they're staying with SIL.\n\nIt could also be an attempt at self-preservation. Considering the options are: 1) don't go at all and deal with the nuclear fallout as MIL and her flying monkeys descend from every angle (yes, she could just block them and whatnot, but when visiting family, especially given the context at the start, who wants to field that while trying to focus on their own family) - especially if SIL is still watching the pets and MIL finds out they were in the area and didn't show. Or 2) go and try to enjoy spending time with the non-jerk family members, therefore placating MIL and assorted monkeys and dropping the NC bomb at a time where OP and her partner are more equipped to field the fallout. Speaking as someone with a similar family, you'd be surprised how much \"being a doormat\", or as I call it, picking/timing your battles, can actually be a great tool in minimizing damage to yourself as you navigate getting out/NC.", "Enjoy your Christmas in Mexico  to the fullest! I love MX and have been there 7 times.", "I second this, refuse to talk to her on the phone, get everything in text, and SCREENSHOT it, in case she figures out that texts can be deleted..", "That's what I don't get."]}
