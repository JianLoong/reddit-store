This has just happened within the past hour.\nFor a bit of context.\nI 24F met my fianc\u00e9 25M (FH for Future Hubby) in 2021. MIL and FIL are alcoholics and drug addicts.\nWith that said, let us start the first of many posts I will be making about this family.\n\nThis year I just found out that my twin sister  24F got diagnosed with breast cancer. We had made plans to visit my family over in Mexico to see her on the  25th-30th of December for 5 days. His mother had just called me and is now trying to get me to cancel my plans because \u201cIt\u2019s not fair that we see my family more over the holidays and she feels insulted.\u201d I have not seen my family since 2020 and this will be the first time FH meets them in person. We are also planning on getting engaged while in Mexico. We are leaving tomorrow to visit his family on the 23rd and 24th of December 2023 His mother decided to wait until the day before we leave to tell me that her plans changed. She is now hosting Chrismas on the 24-25 and expected us to be there since we already RSVPed yes. I tried telling her the situation, that we would be leaving at 6 am Christmas Day to take our flight over to Mexico. She started screaming at me over the phone telling me that I\u2019m an ungrateful asshole and that we RSVPed yes so we can\u2019t change our plans now when she's been waiting so long to see us. (we live 2 hours away from her and until recently we used to go there every weekend) I\u2019m not sure what to do, FH is at work and I'm home with our pets. I\u2019m usually a non-confrontational person but this has hurt my feelings. She has just insulted me once again and expecting to get her way. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the asshole for making the plans with my family but that\u2019s what she\u2019s making me feel like. while writing this post, she and her sisters began sending me nasty texts all about how I'm a horrible person for \u201crefusing FH to see his family\u201d\n\nhe\u2019s been in low contact with her for a while because she\u2019s like this. \n\nThank you for reading! I will be online all day to hear any suggestions and to see if I am the AH.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014UPDATE\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFH just came home for lunch, apparently, MIl has been spam-calling him since she and I spoke. She is saying that I was the aggressor, she started her crocodile tears and spun the story to make her the victim luckily Mil and her sisters had sent me some horrible texts that I could show him. He is appalled by this behaviour, We still plan on going to Mil\u2019s since SIL is going to watch our pets, we had made the decision wir would stay at Sil\u2019s for our visit instead of staying at Mil\u2019s and Fil. Even though she has taken to FB to call me out for stealing her son (again) after this holiday season we are finally going to No contact. Thank you all for your advice and I am glad I am not in the wrong I will update you on the 31st if any of you are interested. I will also respond to any Private messages I receive before tomorrow.

So stop handling her for him, you're taking on a burden that's not yours.\n\nObviously your trip can't be cancelled. NTA", " NTA. You can't ask people to RSVP, then change the plans and expect people to come at another moment because they RSVP'ed for the original moment. \n\nAlso, you should visit your sister. And your MIL can do whatever pleases her, but I'd suggest 'work on jealousy issues'. You don't have to allow her to yell at you. Just say: 'I can hear that you are very emotional about it, but I will not allow you to yell at me. So I am going to hang up on you. If you want to discuss this matter, please call be back when you are able to discuss it in a reasonable tone of voice.'", "NTA.  Do not change your plans.  She pulled this stunt deliberately as a power play. There's a reason you fiance went lc with her. And he should be standing up to her now. Your sister is your priority now. Good luck to her, and to you.", "NTA.  You rsvped for a specific date, not a commitment to her whims. She's being unreasonable.  \n\nShe probably is going through you because he's low contact with her already and thinks she can manipulate you easier with guilt and bullying.  \n\nIf you can send him a text without disturbing his work, give him a heads up via text that his mother is pressuring you to change your plans.  She probably tried to pressure him first. \n\nGo visit your family,  see your sister and get engaged.", "Your RSVP was contingent on the ORIGINAL date she planned to host. But since she changed the date, the RSVP no longer applies. Also, you need to go see your sister. NTA.", "NTA. MIL, I am going with my sister this year. Next year I will do the same unless you adjust how you are speaking to me and speak to me in a respectful tone. \n\nI was diagnosed with the BRCA (breast cancer) gene last year. Just had a double mastectomy. Please get tested for BRCA. Even if you don\u2019t have the surgeries now there are much better ways to detect cancer now.", "NTA start setting stiff boundaries", "You are definitely NTA.\n\nRemain calm and respectful when speaking with/texting her but set your boundaries and hold your ground.\n\nIf you give in to her now, she will expect you to give in always.  Think of her as a toddler who is throwing a tantrum.  Be the adult who can be patient but firm.\n\nI wish you the best.", "NTA.  Tell her you RSVP'd the original date. She changed it so that voids the agreement.  Why are you even giving her space in your head?", ">we RSVPed yes so we can\u2019t change our plans now\n\nYou RSVP'd *for the original dates*. She is the ones who changed the plans *knowing* you had other plans. This was intentional to try to force you to choose her over your family.\n\n>he\u2019s been low contact with her for a while because she\u2019s like this.\n\nTime to switch to *no* contact, imo", "NTA\n\nCalmly state, \"We RSVPed for the 23rd and 24th. We can still come those days as promised. We cannot come on your new dates.\"\n\nIf she continues to fuss: \"We have other obligations, so we cannot switch our schedule to match yours. Have a lovely Christmas and we will see you in the New Year.\"", "You're insulted she even suggested this. Bam, two can play that game :)", "NTA don\u2019t change your plans and stop engaging with her. Let her son deal with her foolishness. Since she doesn\u2019t know how to act like an adult she shouldn\u2019t have access to you.", "Nta. Block her and let him deal with his parents. \n\nTake this as notice that she will be this person in your life forever. Boundaries will be an absolute necessity. Make a plan. Make sure he has a spine.", "NTA. That is not how RSVPs work...you can't change the date and say 'oh you RSVP'd so you have to come'. Get FH to deal with her, she sounds like a bully. Go and see your family and have a great time in Mexico. \nPersonally I would not visit them at all.", "Nta you go with your original plans.", "NTA. RSVPs go both ways.", "NTA\n\nThis is just her way to manipulate and pull a power play.  She changed the date on purpose just to do this.\n\nThink of this as a good test for FH.  He should prioritize your already made plans and you.\n\nHer changing a date does not make it your responsibility to change your lives.\n\nGo on your trip, enjoy your family.", "NTA.  Her comment that you RSVP\"d so you have to show up is ridiculous.  The plans have changed. You only agreed to the original plans on a fixed date. You didn't agree to come to an event held on a floating date.", "NTA. First of all, RSVPs are for a given date, so she doesn't have any kind of etiquette grounds here (of that matters to you). Second, feel free to just block her. Like you don't have to take her bullying", "NTA\nI think you are about to find out how the rest of your life will go with her as a MIL. Your FH really needs to step up or I would reconsider the relationship. You also should visit r/JUSTNOMIL , lots of great advice found there.", "Block all their numbers. If they want to talk to you - they can't. Let them talk to their son instead. You my dear don't have to waste one breath on these excuses for family. Focus on your engagement, and on your sister!\n\nBUT - when you do come back engaged, ensure that you are 100% NC with them. Let your FH handle as much as he is comfortable. Cause dollars to donuts their level of crazy will only escalate from here on out. Doing their best to ensure that your FH is fully reliant on them...", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
