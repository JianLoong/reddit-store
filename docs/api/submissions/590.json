L's mom is hella abusive, and went to jail for it before. L seems to follow after her mom though because she hits me, but we're just messing around. It's a ongoing joke that she's my mom. She does it constantly though and it went from gentle smacks to actual hitting. Plus, Whenever I try to block it she does it more. Even when we aren't messing around she's super stubborn and never listens to me. I have to stay friends with her though, since our parents are close. So that brings us here.\n\n   So today, I was helping L clean her room and their were really old, gross cups of hot chocolate. She asked me to clean it was super chuncky and I can tell it wont come off so I offered to just let it sit in the sink for awhile. She says to just wash it and I say that I can't, so she starts saying that she's done it before and her parents have too. So I'm accustomed to her stubbornness so I just go try to wash it. Obviously it doesn't work and a bunch of it sticks to the side. So I let it sit in hot water. L's mom came over to the kitchen and saw the cups and they were still pretty gross at that point so she started yelling at L. She told L she has to stay home for Halloween so to make up for it I even sent L's mom a whole ass essay of why she should be able to go. L is now not talking to me and only giving yes or no answers when ever I try to talk to her. \n\nAITA for getting her in so much trouble?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the advice, I didn't think it was such a serious situation before. I had thought about telling my school about L's mom before, but I never thought it reflected on how she treats others. My plan is to tell my mom and see what she says to do from there.

She sees the treatment her mom gave her as normal. She is following the pattern of \u2018love\u2019 shown by her mother and she needs help now or she will continue to be hurtful and destructive. \n\nPlease talk to your parents or another trusted adult and get her help! You need a break from this toxicity and she needs help to see her destructive behavior", "NTA. You didn\u2019t get L in trouble; L did. Had she not left cups in her room and washed them after use, they wouldn\u2019t need to soak. And *you shouldn\u2019t be doing her dishes*! Also, L *shouldn\u2019t be hitting you*! Your intentions weren\u2019t to do anything but get the hot chocolate out of the glass. If L\u2019s mom flipped out, that\u2019s not on you. I\u2019m sorry L is blaming you but it\u2019s probably easier for her to blame you than face the facts which is that she has a bad home life with an abusive parent. That\u2019s not fair to you though. Maybe spend some time with other friends.", "NTA and you really need to have deep conversation with your parents for your and your friend sake.\nBecause it definitely can worsen with time and bring them much more stress.\nBetter to do before your friend really crossed the line cause a constant stress, there are currently no conditions that her behavior would improve and it can end really bad for her and apparently for you.\nLike what would happen if she'd full mental breakdown because of abuse when you will be together?", "NTA - but have you talked to your parents about the way that L's mom treats her?  The fact that L is acting out the abuse on you is worrisome.   You do NOT \"have to stay friends\" with someone who assaults you.  You can be friendly, but you don't have to be friends.  Maybe your mother can intervene and suggest that L's mother calm the f\\*\\*k down?\n\nAs far as the grody cups go, L's mother is batshite crazy to go that nuts over a dirty cup. THEY WERE IN THE PROCESS OF BEING CLEANED! At 15, L. doesn't have too many trick-or-treats left, and this punishment seems inappropriately severe.", "NTA, you may feel like a bad friend now but it is probably for the better. I have also been in a situation where a friend has abused me; it starts out as a joke and then quickly turns violent. I would recommend talking to your parents immediately, the behaviour L is exhibiting is very concerning and she is clearly mirroring her mother. This is not your fault and please end the friendship if her hitting continues.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
