When we met we both had very little and we quickly worked our way up. I graduated college and started teaching and he moved from apprentice and became a skilled tradesman. The thing is, I started teaching, and absolutely hated it. My first year I was teaching, working on my masters full time as well and dealing with a small child- I always felt like I was on the verge of a breakdown. Against his advice, I left after my first year but my SO convinced me to not leave the profession entirely and to try again. I did. I tried a different age group and hated it even more. During that year I was diagnosed with anxiety and the stress caused me to breakout something terrible. I decided to leave the profession and look for something else. \n\nThe thing is my SO is not happy about it at alll. He is a hard and diligent worker and thinks that at this age and stage in our lives, we don\u2019t have the luxury of leaving stable careers just cause it\u2019s too hard. He says his job is hard too but he goes there everyday because he has responsibilities to take care of. \nWhile I was teaching we bought a very large house(his choice I wanted a more manageable townhouse) and a luxury sport car(his choice again). With a bachelor\u2019s, teaching experience and an unfinished master\u2019s degree in teaching, I have struggled to find a new job that was paying any close to what I was making as teacher. I ended up having to Sub to bring in some income because his alone cannot cover all of our expenses. My SO looks at this as backward because I am making considerably less money doing almost the same thing,  while he is stretched thin paying for most of our many many bills. I contribute what little money I make, and supplement by doing 95% of the childcare and 100% of our home care and cooking, esp since I am off a lot of days and throughout the summer and he works long hours year round. I have even signed up to go finish my masters in something else so I can get a better job soon. \nHe refuses to downgrade our lifestyle because he said I am the one who flunked out of our partnership and put us in a difficult position and now he is very bitter about it- he brings it up constantly and uses it as- what I feel- a weapon. \nAITA for leaving my job and putting us in this position?", "created_utc": 1689515276, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1516qm6/aita_for_leaving_my_job_and_making_my_husband_pay/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Quitting a job is something that should be decided together.  You don\u2019t get to dip on your job without running it by your partner.  Hate to break it to you but most of us aren\u2019t working for the fun of it.  It\u2019s a means to an end.  We work to keep a roof over our heads, food on the table and for extras when we can afford it.  I didnt work for 14 years to raise my son.  My husband and I agreed on it.  I went back to work this year to pick up insurance for our family.  We are partners.  My husband and I make these decisions together.", "YTA. I'm not sure why you would think quitting was ok when you were aware of your living expenses and you didn't have a back up plan. It really sucks to work at a job you hate but you should have made a plan to do something else before you quit. That wasn't fair to your husband. Would you be ok if he came home today and said he quit his job because he didn't want to be the only one working? There's no shame in not liking what you trained for but you definitely need to to replace your income before making such a huge decision.", "YTA for quitting without a viable plan. He probably needs to find someone who matches his ambitions.", "YTA and he\u2019s right, you don\u2019t have the luxury of not working and having all ends met. You need to be an adult and find a job that will help pay the bills.", "YTA half of adults hate what they do but don\u2019t have a choice but to power through.", "YTA", "YTA.", "ESH.  As a former teacher, I get that it is tremendously stressful and has a major impact on your health.  If a person hasn't ever been in the classroom themselves, they simply don't know what it's like.  Even spouses don't really get a \"view from the trenches\" perspective.  That being said, you've coasted a bit and now you need to get out of that mode.  You needed to come up with an exit strategy before exiting.\n\nYour husband wanted \"the lifestyle.\"  Now he wants to maintain the lifestyle.  When circumstances change, lifestyles sometimes need to change.\n\nYou say you have a lot of days off.  Have you considered tutoring on those days off?  It's a lot less stressful, you can set your own schedule, and you can pick and choose who you work with.  Set a reasonable rate and you'll have customers.  Have you considered proofreading research articles/theses for other students?  Again, it's a service people are willing to pay for.  At least you'll have money coming in.\n\nSign up with a temp agency.  Discuss your skill sets with them.  You've spent two years managing a group of roughly 30 people who have different personalities and skill levels.  Don't sell that short.  You've used people skills to deal with parents and administrators who can, quite honestly, be batsh\\*t crazy.  Don't sell that short, either.  Use the temp jobs to bring in money and sort out what options are appealing to you.\n\nWhen I decided to leave teaching, I put a plan in place before I left.  I've tutored and proofed for other people, so I knew I could use that to stretch my income.  I had 15 years of experience as a paralegal and 5 years' experience as an insurance adjuster.  I'd been laid off by the insurance company I worked for but they held us to a 2-year noncompete agreement so I used the English degree they paid for to segue way into teaching.  I used my teaching skills to segue into something else.  I decided to get my adjusters' license back.  Then I signed up with some independent adjusting companies.  I signed on to work one hurricane for one of them.  I worked 7:00 - 5:00 with a one-hour lunch in an airconditioned office and earned $5k a week for the duration of the assignment.  Between storm assignments, I worked as a secretary through a couple of different staffing services/temp agencies.\n\nI kept looking for jobs that appealed to me, but I had money coming in, which was important since I'm single and have to pay for everything.  Finally, I spotted my \"dream job.\"  I went after it aggressively.  I made sure to tell the recruiter I was working with that I viewed this as my last job search because I want a long-term, committed relationship with one employer.  I now work from home 7:30 - 3:30 with a half hour lunch.  I'm earning over $65k and only working 37.5 hours a week.  Very little work stress and a very comfortable schedule.  Many companies will pay you to work for them while you acquire your required adjusting licenses.  Some states don't even require you to have a license.  My company pays for licensing and Continuing Education, work computer, full health coverage, 401(k) match, HSA, etc.\n\nESH but not too late to save the situation.  You need to apologize to your husband for not having an exit strategy in place.  He needs to reconsider his lifestyle expectations.  You should both talk with an independent third-party to help you work through this situation and get back on the same page.", "YTA, without a doubt", "YTA\n\nSo you just quit your job and forced all the financial burden onto your husband with no warning?

YOu don't trat your partner like that, weaponizing the fact that kids make you feel safe because it will be harder to divorce you.", "YTA. But it's time to do anything you both can to make your lives better. That means sell the luxury car. That means cut all nonessential expenses. And while doing that, keep looking for other work.", "ESH. You need a plan and your husband needs realistic expectations", "INFO: Why did you agree to buy the big house and expensive car if it was \"not your choice\"? Did your partner go behind your back to buy these or did you agree to his suggestions?\n\nElaboration on why I ask:\nIt reads as though you are taking your hands off the responsibility of all those expenses because it was \"not your choice\", but in my opinion, if you agree to buy things that are your partner's suggestions, they are still your choice.\n\nI also miss clear communication here: He buying things that aren't your choice, you leaving jobs and making life and career choices without communicating about it... I would advise talking to each other.", "If my partners job was causing him a great deal of anxiety and he couldn\u2019t deal with it, I would want us to downgrade. I would rather have a smaller house than an unhappy partner.

Lol\nThis is way too big of a life decision to make alone and severely impacts him too.", "YTA. You should\u2019ve found another job before quitting. You are parents with a child. Major decisions aren\u2019t made unilaterally in a marriage. No one forced you to sign the note to buy that house.", "Let's reverse the roles here...  as you stated, your husband's job is hard.  He decides to quit before you and let you support the family while he works out what to next.  Wouldn't you be resentful of his choice and the burden it put on you?  You have caused him great stress to suddenly be the only earner.  You need to communicate with your spouse.  These decisions do not affect you alone, they affect your entire family.  I'm sorry, but it was selfish of you to quit before you had something lined up. I understand wanting to quit for your mental health, and I applaud anyone who makes the difficult decision to change careers,  but you went about this the wrong way.  My spouse is considering changing careers right now as well.  We have discussed it, and I support him 100% - I want him to be happy.  We both understand that it will most likely lead to a pay cut, so we are preparing our finances to be able to maintain our lifestyle.   The difference with us is that there is communication and compromise.  He knows he must continue to work in his current position until he has a new job.  I would find it completely disrespectful of him to up and quit, leaving all financial responsibility to me.  We are a partnership.  Please just try to think about the situation if the roles were reversed - how would you feel?", "YTA for quitting without having a new job lined up. I mean, did you have ANY sort of plan of what you were going to do when you quit?", "YTA. You could have looked for a well paying job while teaching. You could have even gotten your masters at night while still teaching. You never should have quit before finding a suitable job to take its place. So yeah, I have to agree with your husband. The house and car were bought when you could afford them, though he should have taken your input more seriously, but it wasn\u2019t a problem until you quit.", "  There\u2019s enough here for a therapist to unpack for at least a year. Please go seek their help. \n  Suffering for a job that causes high anxiety is inhumane. Ignoring a spouse\u2019s wishes regarding the size of your house and buying expensive cars is unhealthy for your relationship and just dumb financially. His berating you is only compounding the stress of the situation. \n  You do have other options with a teaching degree - maybe seek out corporate training jobs. Look into a certification in it not another masters. The contractor route is an excellent way to experiment with new roles.\n  Be brave. Best of luck", "ESH. He's right, you fucked up,  but he's being a dick about it.\n\nIf you can't hack the work you're in, you hold on until you find something else. Bailing to be a stay at home mom is not that", "ESH, you for quitting without realizing you were only unloading all your responsibilities on your husband's shoulders and him for choosing to be bitter and frustrated about it instead of choosing one of the only two options: accepting the situation or filing for a divorce.", "Yeah, YTA for quitting without a back-up plan.  It seems so strange to me that you could actually be working towards your master's in teaching and hate it.  Did you do no student teaching before?  This is a strange story and I just don't understand.", "I don't think anyone is an asshole.\n\nHowever, with all the expenses y'all have, quitting without a backup is a bad idea, especially if you don't have savings to fall back on till you find something else.\n\nIt seems like you had a communication failure.", "Firstly, finish your masters. That will make you more employable. Secondly, take a job while looking for another job. For example, could you work in an education non-profit? Or for the school board? YTA for leaving a job without a plan to at least replace some of the income you lost.", "YTA \n\nThat is a marriage decision and you literally are doing the same thing for less money. I\u2019m a hard worker too and if my spouse just quit their job and I was shouldered with that, I would consider divorce. \n\nHe didn\u2019t marry a SAHM, he married someone on their way to a career.", "ESH: neither of you are behaving like marriage is a partnership. Are you on the deed to the house? Then you agreed to buy the bigger house. You can\u2019t blame him for \u201cinsisting\u201d when you went along with it. He shouldn\u2019t have been inflexible but you didn\u2019t stop it either. Did he just come home with the car? He\u2019s an asshole. Did you push back and say no to this arrangement? It feels like the two of you are not able to communicate with one another. \n\nYou don\u2019t quit a job without a backup as a parent. Full stop. Again, you didn\u2019t communicate with him or find an alternate even temporarily you just quit. I understand mental health is rough but a lot of us don\u2019t have a partner contributing financially and it\u2019s all on us. We don\u2019t just leave a job and end up homeless with our kids in foster care. We apply to other jobs. We get therapy. We take meds where that\u2019s appropriate. We make a plan for a career change. You had all those options as well but instead you just assumed your partner would accept you being a SAHM and the sole breadwinner. Clearly he isn\u2019t ok with that. \n\nI think you need individual therapy to work on a life plan that will work for you, but the two of you need marriage counseling STAT if you want to stay in this marriage.", "Absolutely NTA.  I taught for 15 years and I 100 oercent understand the burnout. All these people saying, \"Just do it if you have to,\" - it's not that simple. My experience is that once you are that burned out on any giving profession, you actually, physically cannot do it anymore. So I empathize completely. \n\nBeyond the very relevant details that it was your partner who chose to up your living expenses, it sounds like he is thinking in terms of career - i.e. too big picture. I recommend just getting a regular job. You'll advance pretty quickly and won't need to worry about more schooling. Whether it's admin at a learning center or temp-to-perm, the skills you have honed over years of teaching will serve you well in your typical office environment. Just take it one step at a time. \n\nYou don't have to become rich by tomorrow, you just need to bring home a paycheck.

Any college degree will get you in the door plenty of good jobs.. find one.", "ESH. He should have listened to you when you said you were unhappy, but it's unfair to expect him to completely take over finances without at least a discussion. Also, he needs to realize that trying to maintain your current lifestyle\u2014especially the big house and sports car\u2014on less money is just unsustainable.\n\nMy husband once rage quit a job\u2014right after I got laid off, mind you\u2014without taking to me about it and it caused us a LOT of financial troubles even though he was only out of work for about two months. Additionally, my line of work is a bit more niche than his, so he likely could have found a job easily while still working.\n\nI was still receiving severance, but going from two incomes to just my severance in an expensive city was really difficult and put a HUGE stress on our marriage. I was deeply upset by his thoughtlessness and selfishness. We got through it, but it wasn't a good time.\n\nEdited: misread part of the post and changed my judgement", "YTA all around. Poor guy.", "I am really surprised by the amount of YTA. \nI agree that you should have held your ground more with your husband about his luxury lifestyle initially but not surprised you didn't. From what you have written I get the impression your husband gets his own way often. In this society many couple stretch themselves very thin in order to keep up with the Jones. \nI'm sorry to hear you have experienced high stress and anxiety due to work and don't blame you for packing it in. You have done well not to stop entirely, well done for continuing your education, continuing to look after your family and attempt to bring some money into the household.\nI understand your husband's frustrations but you are not a money tree for his lifestyle. I wonder how he would feel if you suffered a physical disablement that prevented you from certain work. \nIn my opinion you have suffered from mental health issues during which you did very well to keep going in some capacity. If he is not willing to compromise on his luxury lifestyle to support your health, I don't know what else you could do. \nSociety needs to take a good look at what is more important... health or stuff!", "Esh. Yes, you should do what you love and change careers if you\u2019re unhappy, but you need a plan. Especially with a small child and significant bills.
