This meant carrying our luggage up and down stairs, through train stations, and onto platforms. After the first couple of train changes, I was getting exhausted. I was already carrying my own suitcase, and my girlfriend asked me to carry her heaviest suitcase as well \u2013 the one with my suit inside.

I felt like it was unfair that I had to carry both my luggage and her largest suitcase, while she only had to deal with her smaller suitcase. Finally, I told her that she needed to carry her own suitcase, as I couldn't keep doing this for the rest of the trip.\n\nShe got upset with me and told me that I was being unsupportive and selfish. She argued that I should be helping her out, as we were going to the wedding for her family. She also pointed out that since my suit was in her suitcase, it was only fair that I help carry it. I tried to explain my point of view, but she didn't seem to understand where I was coming from. We ended up arguing about it for a while, and she eventually carried her own suitcase, but she was clearly annoyed with me for the rest of the day.\n\nSo, AITA for telling my girlfriend to carry her own luggage? I feel like it's reasonable to expect her to handle her own belongings, especially since she chose to bring so much stuff.

Stairs could still be a bit annoying, but at least you wouldn't be hauling heavy cases all over the place.\n\nWhat did she bring that made the case so heavy, anyway? Clothes alone are typically pretty lightweight, so I doubt it was the five dresses that were making it so heavy.", "YTA - hey bud, just a suggestion: don\u2019t get married or have kids.

Being in a relationship means sometimes helping each other. The fact that you chose a suitcase that was too small to fit your suit, so you had to pack it in hers, while still feeling entitled to berate her for \"overpacking\" earns you a YTA. You both could have agreed to book a trip with fewer changes (which can sometimes be more expensive) or to hire a porter. \n\nYour gf may have packed more than necessary for the trip, but at least she got to learn that you aren't going to be there for her when things are difficult, even if it's a minor inconvenience such as carrying a suitcase from one platform to another.", "INFO: What else was in your GF's suitcase besides your suit?", "I am also a light traveler, I even carry my own suits.

It begs the question, if she knew she'd have to carry her own stuff, would she have been more conservative with her packing?\n\nOn the other, you're her partner, of course you should help her with her bags. Partnership, remember? I mean, you can go down the whole \"gender equality\" rabbit hole, but you'll soon run into the argument that women have **alot** more stuff to carry around to look good, which isn't really fair either.\n\nI suggest you both need to try to be a little more considerate.", "YTA you said yourself your suit was in one of the suitcases otherwise you'd need a suitcase as well.", "ESH to me helping her with her luggage implies sharing the responsibility of carrying the luggage.

When you are a team traveling together, it is a team task to carry all the luggage. This should be a non issue if you both genuinely want the other to have a fun time. My husband and I take turns carrying the heavy bags, it's as easy as \"hey this is getting too heavy for me, could you carry it for a while?\" Never a \"this is your bag therefore yours to figure out\" fight. If one of us knowingly packs something unreasonably heavy then a discussion is had in advance over how that item is handled, for example: I really want to pack jugs of heavy juice, so i ask him and if he says it's too heavy then I decide if it is worth it to carry on my own.", "YTA.\n\nFirst off, five dresses is not excessive for early May when the weather doesn't know what it wants to do, for a three day affair/wedding (so you know, multiple events), in a foreign country where you don't really know what to expect.

You also get to wear it to every event and no one will bat an eye over that. The benefits of being a man and not the **sister** of the bride. \n\nThirdly, why the hell do you want to teach your girlfriend a lesson? Persumably you like her. I dunno about you, but I like to help the people I like.

This incident occurred in real time. Assuming you are stronger than your gf you should have helped her, but more strongly insisted on helping by carrying her lighter suitcase only, the logic being you had two bags in total to manage, so she should deal with the heaviest single bag on her own. But you should have helped her in the moment. Then after the trip, discuss her packing habits and intervene before departure next time, to keep things lighter for everyone.", "Info: \n\ndo you like her personal style and the way she looks? Having her stuff is what helps her look the way that attracted you to her. \n\nDoes she generally ask for help with manual tasks? \n\nDo you always let her book travel?

My luggage is designed to attach to other bags for ease of use.", "Not going to vote on this one. But put your suit in your suitcase for the trip back, this will remove her excuses.", "NTA, gotta go against the grain here.  I travel with my husband when he works out of country.  The first thing he tried teaching me was to pack smart & light, 2 nd was that he has his own luggage and work case/ computer to carry, and cannot physically Sherpa my things around the world.   Your not wrong, and she needs to learn.  How I learned? Having my checked bags lost more than once on international flights, because I had to have stuff\u201d just in case\u201d\u2026wow.  Hard lesson being in Warsaw in the winter with no clothes\u2026or my favorite, having two teenagers in Madrid try to pick pocket my roller case because I was dragging it behind me.\nMy husband never checks bags, Carries a duffle and his work case only. And he uses business suits for meetings.  So you are not wrong other than you need to pack your own stuff.  Rule number 3.", "Men are 2x strong in the legs and closer to 3x stronger in the upper body.

It was also the lightest, given it just had dresses and a couple pairs of shoes. If she's carrying anything you'll end up using, like a hair dryer or shampoo, then help carry the blasted suitcase without complaint. She was toting that, and that weight adds up much quicker.", "NTA-ish. I\u2019m like your girlfriend. I don\u2019t want to pack light. I like having options, depending on weather, etc, and I don\u2019t expect anyone else to carry my luggage. It\u2019s my choice to bring so much. BUT- it would have been nice for you to help out occasionally without complaining.", "NTA \nI think since you are technically using the suitcase it makes sense for you to share some of the responsibility of carrying it, which you did for a period of time. It would be kind of you and good for your relationship to give her the occasional hand with it, helping out a bit. \n\nBut expecting you to do it the whole trip? No way. Not carrying her stuff isn't being \"unsupportive\" of her or of the wedding or her family and i don't see how who the trip is for is relevant. \nWhile it's true that women's dresses take up more space and require bigger luggage, she probably didn't need to pack 5. That's her choice and her consequence. It's not fair of her to assume you should just carry it for her, in fact it's sexist. If she knew she was going to need help with it she should have asked if that would be alright with you before the trip.", "NTA. Next time you need to make it clear everyone is going to be responsible for carrying their own luggage.  If someone wants to overpack that\u2019s fine as long as they are the one with the consequences.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong for asking for help putting it up or taking it down from storage.

Can you guys stop and ship some of this stuff back to your home area? So no one has to carry it?", "NTA, its equal share for both parties involved and isn't fair to be expected to carry it at all times because you are the guy.

I tried to explain my point of view, but she didn't seem to understand where I was coming from. We ended up arguing about it for a while, and she eventually carried her own suitcase, but she was clearly annoyed with me for the rest of the day.\n\nSo, AITA for telling my girlfriend to carry her own luggage? I feel like it's reasonable to expect her to handle her own belongings, especially since she chose to bring so much stuff.

But I wouldn't try to phrase it in terms of fairness. Just how exhausted you were.", "It sounds like OP did help by carrying it for \u2018x\u2019 amount of trains. I don\u2019t think he made her carry it for the entire time. They should have taken turns carrying it to be fair. \n\nESH", "I mean it's her family function, how much stuff would be too much? She might carry gifts for her family also she's a female she would obviously need much more accessories than her bf. Sometimes even small things take up space is suitcase because they don't fit well. She could have her periods and would be carrying 2 extra clothes. Who knows.", "Honestly my petty ass would have pulled your suit out of my suitcase and made you carry it while I carried only my things. Since that\u2019s the game you want to play.", "She said she offered to help multiple times...", "Shoes can get pretty heavy if they are chunky. Dresses can get heavy if they have lots of fabric vs bodycon. Either way, the size of the suitcase is also an issue, too.", "Not in Europe and especially not for train travel. It does not exist here. \n\nAlso OP, really? You're making your gf carry the heavy suitcase because you're tired? YTA.", "That makes too much sense !", "Uh.. in a backpack? In one slightly larger suitcase? \n\nLet\u2019s not act like her bringing two large suitcases was the only solution lol", "If she was feeling really vindictive she could remove his things from her bag and tell him to look after his own things, at least for the return trip. He seems to be bragging that his stuff all fit in a carry on but it apparently did not.", "One suit. His stuff is maybe 10% of that suitcase. If I pack one dress from my girlfriend can I expect her to carry my luggage. I think if we aren\u2019t sexist we know the answer. \nUnfortunately I am sexist and I feel OP as the guy in relationship should have handled the situation better and he should know it\u2019s his job to carry the heavier stuff. He should also be able to stop wife from packing ridiculously for a trip since that is going to be a major problem.", "Does she \u2018need\u2019 more accessories or does she want them?", "I mean they both have wheels...", "Wasn\u2019t saying it about her relationship specifically, but the whole \u201cgentlemen are a dying breed, and the only men worth being in relationships with\u201d", "Yeah not in the UK either.", "He didn't though, he put it in her suitcase. He was fine with it when it was convenient for him, but not ok with it when it wasn't.", "But how much room does a man's suit take up? They are pretty large. No way it would go in his suitcase.", "Maybe both, who knows. She might carry some things for her sister and mother which would be available with her and not with them....why is it a topic what she needs and what she wants. They both could have negotiated on how they would have carried all the luggage. And if the bf doesn't wants to help he should take out his things out of her suitcase.", "I mean, it\u2019s a 3 day weekend for a family wedding so there might be multiple events and men can get away with wearing slacks and a button up to all and then the suit for the wedding. Women\u2019s clothing (base pieces and accessories) are a lot more distinctive than men and therefor more noticeable if you repeat. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for her to want a different outfit for each even which would result in a lot of clothing. Especially if heels are involved. This isn\u2019t to speak on a judgement but for some reason men act like women like having cosmetic pressure put on them and like they won\u2019t have shit said about them if they don\u2019t abide by beauty standards (including not repeating outfits for an event)", "Well there must be some reason they both were complaining about carrying them and trying to pawn off responsibility for them on each other\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "\u201cWomen with self-respect and who want to be treated well need to be taken down a peg\u201d is what I\u2019m reading from you.", "He literally carried it though why should  he have to  carry a heavy ass suitcase the whole time just because one thing of his is in there  I think it's  unfair for her  to expect him to carry it the whole time I think k they should take turns IMO", "He got tired of carrying a heavy suitcase that\u2019s almost entirely full of her things. \n\nThere\u2019s literally no reason for him to carry it the entire time just because he has ONE SUIT in it. If she can\u2019t carry it at all, maybe she shouldn\u2019t have packed it.", "He did help though, he did carry it, he just wasn\u2019t willing to carry it the whole rest of the time, also she had stuff in his bag.", "There were more stairs than she realized, but it's pretty easy to realize she probably thought she would use the wheels to move their luggage around. That's why it has them.", "The women who demand \u201ca gentlemen\u201d are typically not very respectful people themselves", "Did you see all suitcases have wheels? So it means just carrying it off and on the train and then wheeling it around. It's really not that hard.", "He's a grown man could have negotiated better", "And you\u2019re basing that off\u2026 what? Can you point to precisely what in the other commenter\u2019s post tells you that she\u2019s not a respectful person? \n\nHere\u2019s what I think. I think you think women who want to be treated respectfully don\u2019t get to assert that\u2019s how they want to be treated. So here\u2019s a question: why does asserting that you want someone who treats you respectfully mean you are not only not a respectful person yourself, but that you don\u2019t deserve what you\u2019ve asked for?", "Ok I didn't see the wheels but my point still stands you say it's not that hard so why couldn't she wheel it then or why couldn't they take turns???", "She\u2019s a grown woman, could have made better decisions", "It's always men who have 'grown' used as an adjective for them.", "I just don't understand why it's such an issue? I've travelled with my husband with more and heavier luggage and I used to always try and carry them, but he'd always offer to take over. After two kids and two C-sections my back is messed up so lifting up heavy things is kind of hard and he always does the heavy lifting. We've had plenty of silly argument over the years but this just seems like such a non-issue to me? If you're young and fit it's not that hard for either of them to carry them and if you're in a loving relationship you enjoy helping each other out? If this is an issue already I worry about their future.", "The issus is that he was carrying it by himself and was getting tired that's why I said they should take turns because I did see some good points with some comments that he did put his suit in her suitcase however she chose to pack heavy did she really need five dresses for a three day trip I don't really care about that I'm just saying if he's  tired and exhausted so why couldn't she carry it for a bit the whole he's a man and should do all the heavy lifting isn't really a good mindset imo it's ok if you disagree that's my opinion it shouldn't just be him helping her but them working together taking turns carrying it", "And also I do agree that if you love someone you should help them out so even if he wouldn't have put his suit in the suitcase he still should have helped her but he shouldn't have had to be the only one to carry/wheel it"]}
