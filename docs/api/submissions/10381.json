Recently I have been feeling like I never get any alone time. I travel for work maybe every two months and will go hang out with friends for a couple hours every so often. So my bf has time to relax and have the house to himself. He however, NEVER leaves. He doesn\u2019t go out to do anything or hang out with anyone. The most time I get to myself is the 45 minutes between when I get home from work and he does. I am starting to lose my mind, I really just want some time to relax in my own home instead of having to drive to a coffee shop or something just so I can watch a tv show he doesn\u2019t like. \n\nI causally mentioned he go do something this weekend and he got upset and said that this is his house too and I can\u2019t make him leave. I agree with him about that, I just want to know if I\u2019m TA for asking him.\n\nEDIT: \n\nI\u2019m seen a lot of comments about this so I wanna address a few things. I was trying to keep my post short but definitely left out some details. He does pay for rent which is why I said I understand him not wanting to leave. We are both introverts so we like our time at home, my point wasn\u2019t that I need a separate room or he is controlling. Sometimes I just wanna blast music and dance around in my underwear, Make food in the shared kitchen, watch tv without another person, etc. I n in on that sounds selfish but I hav won\u2019t had a day where no one was in our house since last May. I love him but I need time to not see another person too. I realize I could compromise more too but I have been for months and I really just want one day to myself. \n\nFinally, I did not say it in a mean way, at least I don\u2019t think so. I simply asked him if he wanted to go to the range this weekend and I could hang at home. He said he had no money and I told him I could help if he wants to go, I would just like a few hours at the place to myself. Then the moment about I can\u2019t make him leave came up. \n\nI hope this helps!

You're not TA for asking, but he's not really TA for wanting to be at home. This could be an indicator of overall compatibility, or it could just mean that the two of you shouldn't live together at this stage of your relationship. If you can afford it, consider an occasional weekend package at a hotel or B&B for some time alone. Otherwise, you're going to have to take your time \"alone\" with him in the apartment, which means there need to be times when you're unavailable, he's not allowed to disturb you, and he does not get to comment on what you're doing (or not doing) before, during or after. When the lease is up, the two of you may need to decamp to separate households. He could see it as a rejection so be prepared for that if you choose to do it.", "It\u2019s natural to want some alone time at home.  My sister and I text each other \u201cHome Alone\u201d memes when our respective husbands are gone for a while!\n\nI\u2019ve never asked my husband if he would go somewhere so I could have the house to myself.  I\u2019ve wanted to, but that\u2019s a big ask.  It would hurt his feelings too.  Instead, I try to find ways to be by myself  like going in my home office, with my headphones on, doing whatever, or going outside in the yard doing things there.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t call you an AH for asking this, but it was a bit insensitive.  This is a challenge all couples face and you just have to find a way to get some alone time.", "NAH.  You both seem to have different needs around space.  Is a larger apartment an option?", "i mean you could explain to him how you feel if he doesn't already know that you need some alone time? it's true that you can't make him leave so YTA in that sense, but perhaps try to communicate to him about it in a better way. though maybe at the same time maybe moving in together wasn't the best choice for you two if it's affecting you this much.", "NAH here.  Your ask didn\u2019t seem confrontational or snide, but if it was then you are the AH.  \n\nYour partner may be very introverted and jus to refer to stay home.  That\u2019s okay.  If you think it\u2019s depression, perhaps raise his getting help.  \n\nI get wanting time in your own dwelling on your own.  Maybe talk to your partner about that desire and see if maybe there\u2019s a way to make that happen?", "NTA for asking, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you communicated your reasons for asking very well at all. This is not a \u201cI casually mentioned this without expressly telling him how I feel\u201d situation. You need to actually tell him that you need privacy sometimes for your own sanity. Not everyone is like this and it\u2019s not fair that you\u2019re expecting your partner to read your mind. My husband is also a homebody and gets way more time in the house by himself because of our work schedules. I had this exact conversation with him, and so now he occasionally takes the dog for long walks so that I get a couple hours in the evening to myself if I need it. But we\u2019re communicating with each other clearly about our needs instead of dropping each other subtle, impossible to interpret hints.", "Maybe TA. It seems to me there is something else to this. Why are you not getting to watch shows you like? Does he commandeer the television and refuse to let you watch, despite your asking?\n\nI\u2019m also curious, what\u2019s to stop you from just taking a sick day at work? Not perfect, but it seems like a short term solution. \n\nThat said; some people don\u2019t like going out and doing things. I know I\u2019d be pretty offended too if my wife tried to push me out of the house.", "I'm more concerned about your bf never leaving the house. It sounds like you are his sole emotional support, and if so, you're probably burned out from that as well as needing some time alone. \n\nNAH for asking; I would get your bf checked for depression.\n\nETA: I meant not leaving the house for anything other than work, sorry for the confusion. If he's not doing social activities, it leads me to believe the gf is the sole social support, which can be hard.", "NAH. However consider that he\u2019s at work all day and maybe all he wants to do is just stay home and spent time with you. Some people have no desire to go out and do anything, and that\u2019s totally fine. You might need alone time, maybe he doesn\u2019t.", "NAH. If you push him to leave, then you would be though. Is your apartment big enough to be in separate rooms? When my husband or I need space, we typically just \u2018claim\u2019 the living room or bed room, and the other will avoid that room for the day to give some space", "YTA. You going to hang with your friends, was your choice. He didn\u2019t ask you to leave.\n\nYou can simply be an adult, and spend some alone time in a different room of the house.\n\nThe commenters are wild today. No one should be giving OP an N-T-A", "You are not the a-hole if he has asked you for the same thing, you have obliged, which it sounds like, and then he is unwilling to do the same for you.\n\nIf he expects you to provide him alone time in the apartment but thinks you do not deserve it, then I think you have far bigger problems than this issue.\n\nYou cannot force someone to leave a home you share together.  You can ask, strongly suggest, but you cannot force.  So, what do you do?  You can only build out personal time and space within the home you share together, and establish some rules to honor that, if he will not leave.  \n\n* For example, maybe you have the rule that you need some alone time and if you are in the bedroom with the door shut, you need to be left alone while you are in there.\n* Or, if you want to be able to watch a TV show by yourself, then buy that extra TV and put it in the bedroom, and, again, when you are in there with the door shut, it's your time alone.\n\nEstablishing some mutually-agreed upon rules for alone time should be do-able.  You can determine where that alone-space is, and how long is a reasonable time to NOT be interrupted.\n\nGet noise-cancelling head phones that you can wear and when you have them on, listening to a pod cast, music, etc., again . . . same concept . . .this is your time to just be in your own head and not interrupted.\n\nAlso, another bigger picture thought to consider is whether you prematurely made a decision to move in together, or whether this is the right guy for you.  Sometimes, until you live with someone, you do not realize how much they get on your nerves, and ultimately, that you are not that compatible.  You don't really suggest this, but just that you need more alone time than he does.  However, if there is more to this situation than you describe . . . and the fact that he does not seem to want to give you space and you never get to watch what you want to on TV . . . I wonder, then you need to think about maybe more than just how to get space from him in your place together, but whether you should be living together in the first place.", "Well, is he on the lease? does he pay rent there? If yes, then he is entitled to be there as much as he wants. You\u2019re asking him to leave his literal home. \n\nHave a conversation with him, let him know you want some personal space and maybe you all can come up with a solution that works for everyone.\n\nYTA", "YTA. If you want alone time in your house, then move out. It's unreasonable to ask him to leave the house just so you can have it to yourself.", "NTA.\n\nI wouldn't be able to handle it either if my partner never left the house. Sometimes you just need to be alone. \n\nDo you really want to be with someone whose reaction to you telling them your needs is to ca you selfish and assert their rights? Yeah, it's his place, too, and he had a right to be there....but he should be willing to get out of the house for a few hours once or twice a month to give you what you need.", "NTA for exploring a solution to an issue.  His reaction of \"its my house too and you can't make me leave\" is immature and beside the point, like a child rebelling against their mom.  If conversations about compatibility and compromise can't be had, the relationship can only go so far.", "NTA. When we moved to work from home, my spouse no longer gave me any space as he wasn't going into the office ( I already worked from home). I am out a lot, but he hardly leaves and if he does he seems to time it when I am out. Drives me nuts and some of my friends have said same in their houses. \n\nI have hinted and finally asked him. Funnily he brought it up at a party the other night and the couples we were talking with the guys said their spouses had asked the same lol. Wondering if it's just women who need some time to decompress and knowing you have un-interupted time.", "NTA. I need my alone time, I\u2019d seriously not be okay if I couldn\u2019t have it. \ud83d\ude23 I hope you two can communicate on the issue because everyone needs their space.", "NTA\n\nAppropriate space is just important for a relationship as closeness. It does take quite a bit of maturity to understand that people need their own time and space for decompression. Casual mentions won't do, you guys need a full on conversation to come up with boundaries and a plan for both.", "Nta. Partners in healthy relationships care about each others needs and accommodate them.", "NTA but it's not healthy for him to be isolating like this. He should have his own friends and places to go on his own time. I'd check for codependency", "NTA , I actually love my alone time in my house, doesn\u2019t happen often, maybe a couple times a week for short periods of time but it helps me mentally recharge and look forward to seeing/ being with the rest of my family. Everyone needs their space", "NTA, I get it, I need some time for myself too, maybe you should discuss this matter before moving in together. It is kind of difficult. I find a little strange, that he had non social life out the house, is he depressed o has some metal issues? sit with him and talk the situation", "I'm tempted to say yes, for the fact that it is his  apartment too, so he has every right to stay home if he wishes.", "NTA it's one thing if your boyfriend is around but accommodating. It sounds like he considers the TV, music and you attention to be pretty much at his disposal at all times. That sounds exhausting, unfair and unhealthy for both of you.", "Eh, NTA for wanting some privacy. Sounds like you live in a 1 bedroom. Why not get a 2 bedroom so you can have your own space when someone else is in the living room?", "YTA - let\u2019s look at the math: \n\n>I travel for work maybe every 2 months \n\n>the most time I get to myself is the 45 minutes between when I get home and he does. \n\nThis ads up to 4:15 per week for you. x 2 months is 34 hours of alone time every 2 months. \n\nIf you\u2019re gone 2 days every time you leave for work he gets 48 hours solo - 16 hours he has to work (not including his commute), so that\u2019s 32 hours. He\u2019s asleep for about 16 of those, so 16 hours is the amount of \u201calone time\u201d in the apartment he gets to watch his shows and relax every 2 months when you travel compared to 34 hours for you.  \n\nIf you\u2019re gone for 4 days every time it would even out, but it\u2019s also not a situation he\u2019s created, so he shouldn\u2019t be punished if he doesn\u2019t want to leave his home to create more alone time for you when there is likely already an imbalance in your favor.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I totally understand how it feels to not get alone time when someone is always present in the home, and I don\u2019t think you are TA for feeling the way you have and saying something. However, if being at home so much is important to him, then you need to work together to find something that works for both of you. I am an introvert and need a lot of alone time. I discussed this with my husband when we first got together and I call it needing \u201cbubble time\u201d and he totally got it and isn\u2019t offended if I need to bubble. I disappear off to the bedroom to do my own thing, normally watching shows he does not like, and he knows not to disturb me.

There are separate rooms.\n\nWhen I want some time to myself, I don\u2019t ask my wife to leave the house. That\u2019s just a wild request. I just go to a different room.", "But a bigger house would fix that (just having a space to go be alone) and OP suggested it wouldn\u2019t (may not be affordable of course, but compared to living alone would be anyway)?", "Yes, I can see that viewpoint, but I guess my standards are just higher for being an a-hole.  \n\nTo me, she sounds like someone who is maybe not very assertive *(caters to all his TV-watching desires, for example)* . . . did not really understand her own needs for alone-time when she made the decision to co-habitate with someone . . . or has come to realize that he *\"bugs the-ever-living crap out of her*\" only after living with him, and needs more breaks from him than she realized going into the relationship.  I don't think these things make her an a-hole as much as just a human being that needs to find some coping strategies, ***and you're right . . . expecting him to leave his home is not the way to do it.***", "NTA. I went 18 months without ever once being alone in my apartment. I literally handed my bf money and told him to go see a movie or something because I just wanted a couple of hours of being alone.", "NTA. Being at home doesn't make him TA though. What makes him TA is that he apparently has a problem with you watching or listening to anything he doesn't enjoy.", "NTA My hubby and I are both introverts and dislike each other's music and programme choices. (Huge clashes.) But we go into other rooms to read, watch DVD's or listen to music, or dance around crazy, do a work out etc. If your bf won't let you separate in that way and let you do your own thing alone in the space you have, then you may have to get separate rentals when your lease is up.", "I went through much the same thing. I'm generally quite extroverted but I work in a public facing role where I also supervise a large team so there is always someone needing something of me. There was a period when my husband was unemployed and so always home alone and I felt like I never got any silent time to myself. When I eventually told him how much I needed that time he joined a club so that he would be out of the house one evening a week and I could do my own thing. So I absolutely don't think you are an ah. But he also has a right to not want to leave the house. Although I do think that's a bit unhealthy for him. Does he know how much you feel you need the truly alone time - I definitely feel like there is a compromise to be reached.", "NTA everybody needs some \"me-time\" in their own home and especially introverts. You say he is also an introvert so he should understand your need for it.", "This is like a microcosm of what many relationships went through during the pandemic. NAH but you guys need to discuss and come to an arrangement that works, longterm. Because the status quo is not an option.", "I'm like OP in needing alone time, and I can assure you that a larger apartment does not solve the problem.  My house has plenty of space, but that doesn't stop my husband from coming in to ask me a question 10 minutes after I've started watching a movie.  It doesn't stop him from making his own racket that I can hear.  It doesn't stop him from trying to help me when with a project, when I don't want or need help.  Etc.  None of these things he's doing are wrong in any way, but it happens constantly so I can never just relax at home unless he is somewhere else.", "That\u2019s literally where I am at.", "I totally get it.  And reading all of the comments, so many people say \u201cjust go in another room\u201d. It is not the same thing as what you are talking about.   I am in a similar situation.  The only time I am truly alone is when I am driving to and from work which is only 10 minutes each way, so 20 minutes or less each day. Otherwise there is always someone in the house.  Yes, I can stay in my bedroom and close my door but it is knowing that 24/7 there is always someone else there.  Can\u2019t go in the kitchen and cook or clean without someone watching what I am doing or can\u2019t grocery shop without someone seeing what I bring into the house.  Have to be mindful at all times that there\u2019s someone else in the house and the person in my house is an very early riser so I can never even be the only one awake in the morning when I drink my coffee.    I totally understand just wanting some time where you are totally alone.  I do not think it\u2019s unreasonable and you should not have to \u201cgo to your room\u201d to get away.   Adults should not have to stick to living out of their bedroom.", "That averages out to more time for him, but that\u2019s also Saturday through Sunday that he has to take care of the place by himself while you\u2019re off on per-diem racking up airline miles and hotel points, so now we have to take into account the mismatch in uncompensated labor, and it\u2019s still not the windfall of free time you seem to think it is. \n\n*Figure it out*", "I think a lot of people just have more indoor hobbies (painting, video games, crafts, stamp collecting, etc) some people are fulfilled without going outside. I think its a compatability issue or a lack of space issue", "I don't think she meant leave for the whole weekend, just leave to go do something during the weekend.", "They already have the bedroom and living room, they can easily be in separate rooms, adding more rooms isn\u2019t really necessary as they can still only occupy two rooms at one time? What OP is saying is she just wants some house to herself time occasionally which is totally valid and relatable. Even as a kid I cherished my alone time in the house where I could wheel around screaming RATM songs.", "There is something about having the whole house to yourself that is very relaxing, at least for some people. I live in with my spouse and 2 kids. During quarantine, we managed to keep off each others\u2019 nerves. I remember the first day everyone else was out of the house for several hours. I realized I hadn\u2019t had the house to myself for over a year, and the sensation of being ALONE in my own home was wonderful!", "NAH. My suggestion: move out and get your own apt. It'll be a hassle, but it sounds like long term it would be worth it. Having your own space is a need sometimes. If you can afford it, do it.", "NTA", "Could you take a day off work to hang at home while he's at work?", "NTA", "NAH but I feel your pain. Being home alone is wonderful, and I hardly ever get that kind of solitude. Can you take a vacation day from work once in awhile while your BF works?", "Nah. But it seems you both moved in before you were ready. Living alone is awesome. Having a s/o that has a social life is important also", "NTA, that's not alone time. He should understand, it's simple empathy.", "Ha ha! Yes we can get to that point!", "I feel your pain sister! My husband has the Tv on constantly, watching old Westerns, etc. and very loud because he\u2019s deaf.  \\[Insert crazy woman emoji here\\].  I confess I use noise cancelling headphones to make it tolerable.  And when I go to my home office, he comes in ALL THE TIME asking me stuff that is really nothing.  He says he misses me . .. I\u2019m in the next room for GOD\u2019S SAKE.  He has finally realized I truly don\u2019t want or need his help on any project I work on.  We have very different ways of working and he knows to just stand back and wait until I\u2019m done.", "Well that\u2019s also your husband being rude if you\u2019ve asked for alone time. He is being wrong coming and asking you questions etc. It\u2019s much more reasonable to ask someone \u201cHey, I want some time alone, don\u2019t talk to me for a bit while I watch a film, okay?\u201d And asking them to leave the house.", "> he knows to just stand back and wait until I\u2019m done.\n\nAs long as he doesn't stand there and WATCH you work - you know, just in case you change your mind and need his help after all.  Bloody hell.", "Oh, he doesn't do those things when I ask for alone time.  When I ask for alone time, he arranges to go out for a few hours or a day sometime in the near future, because he's not an asshole.  We're talking once a month at the most that I ask for this.  Like OP's husband, *he* gets quite a bit of alone time, because I go out much more often than he does.", "She likes spending *most* of her time with him, I'm sure.  Occasionally she would like to be alone in the apartment, so she can do what she likes there without being disturbed, and without having to think about whether he likes it.  There is nothing wrong with that.", "Ha ha!  Men are so like that, aren\u2019t they?  My dear husband has finally realized it\u2019s best to just let me do my thing, and stay out if my way!", "There's really nothing like it. I don't do anything differently except make more noise, but the freedom I feel is immeasurable. It's exhausting living with someone who is both home all of the time, and doesn't get it.", "Oh I agree but that\u2019s not what she\u2019s describing. And it\u2019s also not fair to ask someone to leave to get that. She could get that by taking a PTO day while he\u2019s at work, but that\u2019s just living with people. But it\u2019s way reasonable to want to have some alone time which she can still have if they get set up for it\u2014he doesn\u2019t have to be forced out for that.", "Yes! I agree, those tIke\u2019s are rare and we love them!", "Yea I totally get where OP is coming from. Having a private room just isn't the same. It's my favorite parts of the week when I'm home alone.", "Some people don\u2019t like relaxing in the bedroom so a separate hobby/game/media room might help?\n\nI think it\u2019s understandable to want the house to yourself but also understandable not to want to go out, especially if you work out of the house and are gone all those hours. But I\u2019m saying part of her issue could be resolved\u2014 it\u2019s not all or nothing. The things she wants could still happen more than they do.\n\nI do think it\u2019s unfair to make people leave their home, especially if the BF is an introvert and works outside the home every day (I know when I didn\u2019t WFH I was too socially exhausted to go out most weekends or nights\u2026 I love the house to myself too but I\u2019d never tell my husband to leave, as he\u2019s also an introvert)."]}
