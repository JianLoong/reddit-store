You're not TA for asking, but he's not really TA for wanting to be at home. This could be an indicator of overall compatibility, or it could just mean that the two of you shouldn't live together at this stage of your relationship. If you can afford it, consider an occasional weekend package at a hotel or B&B for some time alone. Otherwise, you're going to have to take your time \"alone\" with him in the apartment, which means there need to be times when you're unavailable, he's not allowed to disturb you, and he does not get to comment on what you're doing (or not doing) before, during or after. When the lease is up, the two of you may need to decamp to separate households. He could see it as a rejection so be prepared for that if you choose to do it.", "It\u2019s natural to want some alone time at home.  My sister and I text each other \u201cHome Alone\u201d memes when our respective husbands are gone for a while!\n\nI\u2019ve never asked my husband if he would go somewhere so I could have the house to myself.  I\u2019ve wanted to, but that\u2019s a big ask.  It would hurt his feelings too.  Instead, I try to find ways to be by myself  like going in my home office, with my headphones on, doing whatever, or going outside in the yard doing things there.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t call you an AH for asking this, but it was a bit insensitive.  This is a challenge all couples face and you just have to find a way to get some alone time.", "NAH.  You both seem to have different needs around space.  Is a larger apartment an option?", "i mean you could explain to him how you feel if he doesn't already know that you need some alone time? it's true that you can't make him leave so YTA in that sense, but perhaps try to communicate to him about it in a better way. though maybe at the same time maybe moving in together wasn't the best choice for you two if it's affecting you this much.", "NAH here.  Your ask didn\u2019t seem confrontational or snide, but if it was then you are the AH.  \n\nYour partner may be very introverted and jus to refer to stay home.  That\u2019s okay.  If you think it\u2019s depression, perhaps raise his getting help.  \n\nI get wanting time in your own dwelling on your own.  Maybe talk to your partner about that desire and see if maybe there\u2019s a way to make that happen?", "NTA for asking, but it doesn\u2019t sound like you communicated your reasons for asking very well at all. This is not a \u201cI casually mentioned this without expressly telling him how I feel\u201d situation. You need to actually tell him that you need privacy sometimes for your own sanity. Not everyone is like this and it\u2019s not fair that you\u2019re expecting your partner to read your mind. My husband is also a homebody and gets way more time in the house by himself because of our work schedules. I had this exact conversation with him, and so now he occasionally takes the dog for long walks so that I get a couple hours in the evening to myself if I need it. But we\u2019re communicating with each other clearly about our needs instead of dropping each other subtle, impossible to interpret hints.", "Maybe TA. It seems to me there is something else to this. Why are you not getting to watch shows you like? Does he commandeer the television and refuse to let you watch, despite your asking?\n\nI\u2019m also curious, what\u2019s to stop you from just taking a sick day at work? Not perfect, but it seems like a short term solution. \n\nThat said; some people don\u2019t like going out and doing things. I know I\u2019d be pretty offended too if my wife tried to push me out of the house.", "I'm more concerned about your bf never leaving the house. It sounds like you are his sole emotional support, and if so, you're probably burned out from that as well as needing some time alone. \n\nNAH for asking; I would get your bf checked for depression.\n\nETA: I meant not leaving the house for anything other than work, sorry for the confusion. If he's not doing social activities, it leads me to believe the gf is the sole social support, which can be hard.", "NAH. However consider that he\u2019s at work all day and maybe all he wants to do is just stay home and spent time with you. Some people have no desire to go out and do anything, and that\u2019s totally fine. You might need alone time, maybe he doesn\u2019t.", "NAH. If you push him to leave, then you would be though. Is your apartment big enough to be in separate rooms? When my husband or I need space, we typically just \u2018claim\u2019 the living room or bed room, and the other will avoid that room for the day to give some space", "YTA. You going to hang with your friends, was your choice. He didn\u2019t ask you to leave.\n\nYou can simply be an adult, and spend some alone time in a different room of the house.\n\nThe commenters are wild today. No one should be giving OP an N-T-A", "You are not the a-hole if he has asked you for the same thing, you have obliged, which it sounds like, and then he is unwilling to do the same for you.\n\nIf he expects you to provide him alone time in the apartment but thinks you do not deserve it, then I think you have far bigger problems than this issue.\n\nYou cannot force someone to leave a home you share together.  You can ask, strongly suggest, but you cannot force.  So, what do you do?  You can only build out personal time and space within the home you share together, and establish some rules to honor that, if he will not leave.  \n\n* For example, maybe you have the rule that you need some alone time and if you are in the bedroom with the door shut, you need to be left alone while you are in there.\n* Or, if you want to be able to watch a TV show by yourself, then buy that extra TV and put it in the bedroom, and, again, when you are in there with the door shut, it's your time alone.\n\nEstablishing some mutually-agreed upon rules for alone time should be do-able.  You can determine where that alone-space is, and how long is a reasonable time to NOT be interrupted.\n\nGet noise-cancelling head phones that you can wear and when you have them on, listening to a pod cast, music, etc., again . . . same concept . . .this is your time to just be in your own head and not interrupted.\n\nAlso, another bigger picture thought to consider is whether you prematurely made a decision to move in together, or whether this is the right guy for you.  Sometimes, until you live with someone, you do not realize how much they get on your nerves, and ultimately, that you are not that compatible.  You don't really suggest this, but just that you need more alone time than he does.  However, if there is more to this situation than you describe . . . and the fact that he does not seem to want to give you space and you never get to watch what you want to on TV . . . I wonder, then you need to think about maybe more than just how to get space from him in your place together, but whether you should be living together in the first place.", "Well, is he on the lease? does he pay rent there? If yes, then he is entitled to be there as much as he wants. You\u2019re asking him to leave his literal home. \n\nHave a conversation with him, let him know you want some personal space and maybe you all can come up with a solution that works for everyone.\n\nYTA", "YTA. If you want alone time in your house, then move out. It's unreasonable to ask him to leave the house just so you can have it to yourself.", "NTA.\n\nI wouldn't be able to handle it either if my partner never left the house. Sometimes you just need to be alone. \n\nDo you really want to be with someone whose reaction to you telling them your needs is to ca you selfish and assert their rights? Yeah, it's his place, too, and he had a right to be there....but he should be willing to get out of the house for a few hours once or twice a month to give you what you need.", "NTA for exploring a solution to an issue.  His reaction of \"its my house too and you can't make me leave\" is immature and beside the point, like a child rebelling against their mom.  If conversations about compatibility and compromise can't be had, the relationship can only go so far.", "NTA. When we moved to work from home, my spouse no longer gave me any space as he wasn't going into the office ( I already worked from home). I am out a lot, but he hardly leaves and if he does he seems to time it when I am out. Drives me nuts and some of my friends have said same in their houses. \n\nI have hinted and finally asked him. Funnily he brought it up at a party the other night and the couples we were talking with the guys said their spouses had asked the same lol. Wondering if it's just women who need some time to decompress and knowing you have un-interupted time.", "NTA. I need my alone time, I\u2019d seriously not be okay if I couldn\u2019t have it. \ud83d\ude23 I hope you two can communicate on the issue because everyone needs their space.", "NTA\n\nAppropriate space is just important for a relationship as closeness. It does take quite a bit of maturity to understand that people need their own time and space for decompression. Casual mentions won't do, you guys need a full on conversation to come up with boundaries and a plan for both.", "Nta. Partners in healthy relationships care about each others needs and accommodate them.", "NTA but it's not healthy for him to be isolating like this. He should have his own friends and places to go on his own time. I'd check for codependency", "NTA , I actually love my alone time in my house, doesn\u2019t happen often, maybe a couple times a week for short periods of time but it helps me mentally recharge and look forward to seeing/ being with the rest of my family. Everyone needs their space", "NTA, I get it, I need some time for myself too, maybe you should discuss this matter before moving in together. It is kind of difficult. I find a little strange, that he had non social life out the house, is he depressed o has some metal issues? sit with him and talk the situation", "I'm tempted to say yes, for the fact that it is his  apartment too, so he has every right to stay home if he wishes.", "NTA it's one thing if your boyfriend is around but accommodating. It sounds like he considers the TV, music and you attention to be pretty much at his disposal at all times. That sounds exhausting, unfair and unhealthy for both of you.", "Eh, NTA for wanting some privacy. Sounds like you live in a 1 bedroom. What not get a 2 bedroom so you can have your own space when someone else is in the living room?", "YTA - let\u2019s look at the math: \n\n>I travel for work maybe every 2 months \n\n>the most time I get to myself is the 45 minutes between when I get home and he does. \n\nThis ads up to 4:15 per week for you. x 2 months is 34 hours of alone time every 2 months. \n\nIf you\u2019re gone 2 days every time you leave for work he gets 48 hours solo - 16 hours he has to work (not including his commute), so that\u2019s 32 hours. He\u2019s asleep for about 16 of those, so 16 hours is the amount of \u201calone time\u201d in the apartment he gets to watch his shows and relax every 2 months when you travel compared to 34 hours for you.  \n\nIf you\u2019re gone for 4 days every time it would even out, but it\u2019s also not a situation he\u2019s created, so he shouldn\u2019t be punished if he doesn\u2019t want to leave his home to create more alone time for you when there is likely already an imbalance in your favor.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I disappear off to the bedroom to do my own thing, normally watching shows he does not like, and he knows not to disturb me.
