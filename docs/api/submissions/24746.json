Please do whatever is needed to get that help.  Can you reach out to other family members?  Minister?  Family friend?  Make cell phone recordings of some incidents to show to your parents, school counselor?  Tell Jon to report to his teacher/principal, show them the recordings?  \nBe as firm, blunt and insistent as possible with your parents.  My older brother became violent toward me in his teens, only when parents weren\u2019t home.  They refused to get him mental health care for his diagnosed anxiety disorder, and just ignored my reports of his physical assaults.  Finally he threw me down on the floor and my head landed a fraction of an inch from the fireplace hearth.  There\u2019s more, I am here today by the grace of God.  When parents still ignored me, I said \u201che almost killed me today and it would have been an accident and he\u2019d feel really bad, but it wouldn\u2019t make me any less dead.  I\u2019m afraid of him, I can\u2019t control him.  I don\u2019t want him to kill me.\u201d  They still acted unconcerned, but they stopped leaving us alone together.  Still didn\u2019t get him help, but at least I felt less unsafe and I lived to tell the tale.
