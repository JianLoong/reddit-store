My step sister (18) lives in TN and continually reaches out to me for pricing on tattoos she wants but has no plans of commuting to get tattooed by me any time soon. She doesn\u2019t talk to me about anything else just this and shared that she does want a tattoo from me at some point just not soon.(originally she wanted me to do her first)\n\nFor a while I entertained it and told her why I\u2019d charge on any given concept and placement she gave me but told her to take it up w the artist she most would like to do the particular piece and save up a few hundred extra beyond what\u2019s quoted incase it takes longer to do than they anticipated. \n\nRecently she messaged me again about another tattoo and I was done. I told her I can\u2019t quote her anymore if she isn\u2019t going to get it from me and book an appointment bc every artist charges based on the cost of work in their area, their skills and experience, and market value of the area. \n\nShe complained to my mother who shared that she also expected my mom (her stepmom) and her father to foot the bill. Something my mom is very against. Mom believes that if you want a tattoo you should save and spend good money working with a respectable qualified artist bc it\u2019s intended to be with you for life.\n\nI reached out to my sis and told her I am no longer comfortable discussing the issue further and I will not tattoo her until she is able to respect the process that goes into curating a piece for her (she has also asked me to replicate other artists work which I find appallingly disrespectful to the og artist, the client, and my artistry) and ah stage means to actually get to me.\n\nShe said I owe it to her as her brother to help her with this and I\u2019m being unreasonable to refuse tattooing her bc it would \u201cbe good for my portfolio.\u201d What she\u2019s asking for isn\u2019t a style I prefer to do but is totally within my skill set so it wouldn\u2019t actually benefit me at all.\nShe has also shared that she expects a discount or free tattoo from me \u201cbc we are family.\u201d Everyone else in the family insists on paying me so I don\u2019t give out freebees anymore.\n\nI told her I don\u2019t owe her anything and she needs to take this seriously and respect me and my peers. So I stood my ground.\n\nSo.

Pretty clear cut, you haven't done anything wrong and are just setting boundaries.", "NTA big time. Your sister is young, doesn\u2019t understand that in your industry, time very much is money. But it\u2019s not just the time, but the energy you\u2019re spending too, all for no paid sessions. I also get the feeling that she would have no problem taking your design and trying to find someone at the price she wants to pay. You\u2019ve given her good guidance, it sounds like. Totally agree, don\u2019t discuss with her anymore. Family and business don\u2019t mix.", "Nta!!", "NTA for standing your ground against an entitled teen\n\nrespect for your professionalism to the art", "NTA - She is self centered and disrespectful. Yes, you do not 'owe' her this nor other things she adds to the request (free or discounts, copy an artists work). It is concerning she does not listen and shows no ability to integrate your feedback. 'No' is a full sentence. \n\nYou are curating your business, art and livelihood. Your standards are admirable and reasonable. Don't allow this experience to impact your headspace; keep creating!", "NTA, you are just being professional.", "NTA.\n\nYou wouldn't be the asshole even if your first and only answer was, \"Sorry, I'd rather not tattoo relatives.\" No harm in that. But you helped her way more than that, until she started getting unreasonable. At this point, she is drifting into asshole territory and you are not at all.", "NTA, you don't owe her anything. You were right to stand your ground. She sound very entitled and like a huge brat. It will be good for your portfolio sounds way too much like asking you to put out a ton of work for free. You don't have to entertain that or waste your time on quotes she isn't going to follow up on anyway.", "NTA but I do think you let it go a bit far. Easily done though.\n\nI probably would have just nodded and smiled and told her that I will chat to her about it when we meet face to face, she is serious about making an appointment to travel to my shop and has a ball park amount of money saved. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of like a young person repeatedly asking for costing and advice on a components for a computer build when they have neither the funds to make the purchase or are not even locationally able to pick the damn thing up should a fairy pop it into existence. It\u2019s all a bit unrealistic and conceptual.", "Yes", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They treat me as a professional in that setting not as their kid until after the session on personal time. \n\nAlso I plan for art thrives so I only give rough sketches prior to the day of and almost never send the final product unless it\u2019s a long running project an a consistently returning client.

I\u2019m sure she won\u2019t stop at one she doesn\u2019t seem like that kind of person. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever be totally covered but definitely a fair few are in her future IMO."]}
