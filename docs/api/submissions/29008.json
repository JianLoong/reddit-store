You cancelled your friends' vacation?", "how does Palestinians being murdered put you at risk for being a white woman? lmao YTA", "YTA, especially since you don\u2019t plan to pay them back for the flight cost.

How is this even a question?", "YTA for cancelling the whole trip without consultation. I do understand where you were coming from and would probably feel the same way. But there's a need to communicate, and as a minimum try to swap yourself out for someone else who's happy to take on the risk. Either way it's hectic to make an executive decision without a conversation. Why are you planning a holiday with people you can't have a conversation with? Holidays can get stressful, especially when you're tired from travelling etc. \n\nI think it's fair for them to ask you to pay them back for the flights, and tbh you probably should have expected them to ask you (I certainly would have, and would have at least offered during the conversation that I would also have had with them if it turned out, during the chat, that cancellation was the only option). \n\nYou spent $2500, you either lose $2500 or lose $500/get $2000 back. You pay them back the $500 each and you still end up with $1000 back. $1000 back vs $0 back is a no brainer.", "YTA. So they loose $500 each on flights because you made the decision by yourself. A decision that effects them. Not nice. You totally should cover the cost of their flights. You took any final decision out of their hands so you should cop the cost.", "YTA. You robbed them of their money and holiday because you didn\u2019t feel safe. Yes there is some serious shit in Gaza but there are no warnings against Jordan nor has the safety level there worsened.", "YTA, and that\u2019s one reason why you shouldn\u2019t book packages.
