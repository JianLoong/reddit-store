Do you think he has even once tried to see yours? \n\nWomen tend to do a lot of the emotional work of relationships. Often by capitulating to what their partner wants. It doesn\u2019t make you a good wife. It makes you a doormat and a bad example to your children. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to tear you down, OP. I just want you to do sone really serious thinking about your relationship and the things you NEED to resolve with your husband. \n\nYou\u2019re burnt out and the division of labor is not working as is.

I scrolled a while before finding something I agreed with. It doesn't need to be an argument or a confrontation: just count the number of kid-free hours he gets, compare that to your zero kid-free hours, explain that you are going to burst at the seans without some relief, and come to an agreement about how many hours a week you get to take for yourself. You get to decide if you would rather stay home alone, or go out alone, but I *heavily* recommend going out, so you get fresh neuro-stimulation and new experiences. Staying home alone can feel like a relief, but there can also be a sense of resentment when everyone comes flooding back (especially if they come back early, or way too late), and resentment that Dad gets to take the kids out for the \"fun stuff\" that should be done as a family while you sit at home. Make it more than two hours.

It's so tempting!\n\nSo instead of dealing with the kids all on your own start patting him on the shoulder with 'your turn's about 50% of the time, maybe even tell the kids \"go ask dad\" and the like.

You didn't pop out these kids alone. His actions are selfish for a parent. \n\nStay at home mom is still a job. Does he trade off weekends with you so you get time to put your headphones on and unwind? \n\nI am childless, and I game a lot. You're being reasonable about a hobby you both share.

Because he knows you'll do it, and that you won't turn the tables on him because the kids will suffer. \n\nThis issue will only get bigger when the kids do. If he's giving you the silent treatment now, he's not going to suddenly see reason and snap out of it. \n\nIt's time to have a serious think about being a SAHM for much longer, because you will never ever manage to be accommodating enough for his entitlement, and I promise you that if he's not already thinking it, at some point he's going to decide that you have to take whatever he dishes out because he earns 100% of the income supporting your family.", "If I get to shower alone for 10 minutes lmao.", "you deserve better"]}
