You get to decide if you would rather stay home alone, or go out alone, but I *heavily* recommend going out, so you get fresh neuro-stimulation and new experiences. Staying home alone can feel like a relief, but there can also be a sense of resentment when everyone comes flooding back (especially if they come back early, or way too late), and resentment that Dad gets to take the kids out for the \"fun stuff\" that should be done as a family while you sit at home.
