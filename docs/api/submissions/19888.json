Waaay too often girls are not believed in these situations. Again, you may find out that the kids are fine with the BF and this is the dad being an ah, but you cannot jump to conclusions.

He and your wife are co-parents.  He needs to discuss this with her, not you. You should have referred him to his wife to discuss his concerns about things related to his kids.\n2. You should have then promptly gone to your wife, to give her a heads up about the issue, and make sure the two of you are in agreement about the household.\n3. There doesn't have to be anything bad happening for dating teenagers to make a place uncomfortable for younger kids. You may need to discuss boundaries with your son, such as \"no necking (or whatever kids are calling it today) in front of the younger kids.  Take it someplace private.\" And be sure that the teenagers have options with reasonable privacy from the younger kids.\n4. If anything is making the younger kids uncomfortable, they probably won't be confiding in you about it, because they know you'll (properly) prioritize your son.  Depending on the dynamics of the household, they may not feel comfortable discussing it with your wife, their mother.  They may have confided their concerns with their father.  Which would not be an inappropriate thing for kids to do. \n5. If the kids confided in their father about a dynamic in your household that is making them unhappy or uncomfortable, this needs to be addressed by you and your wife, together, considering the needs of both sets of kids. \n6. This may not be the teenagers doing anything bad to the younger kids.  It may be as simple as the older kids monopolizing the living room tv with shows that don't interest younger kids. Knowing about such problems and sorting them is necessary.  You didn't take the time to find out specifics of what the father was concerned about.\n7. If the father does take this to court, the burden of dealing with that will fall primarily on your wife, not you.  Escalating this and causing her problems should be a last resort, and you let this get to the point of the father threatening court without your wife even knowing what is going on. Which goes back to the need for points 1 and 2. \n8. Are you and your wife leaving the younger kids alone with your son and his boyfriend?  The father wanting you or your wife, as adults, to be around when your teenage son has friends his age over (dating, or just friends to hang out) would not be an unreasonable request from the father.", "E S H.

If the teenagers are distracted by hanging out together, that's not good for the kids being supervised.\n\n\"I am not okay with my kids being supervised by their stepbrother, especially if the stepbrother has guests his own age\" is completely reasonable.  \n\nYounger kids at a gathering of teenagers is a situation that can go wrong in many ways. \n\nIf OP acts this way when someone tells him they are uncomfortable with something in his household, I'm very glad the father said he was the one uncomfortable, even if the kids to the father they were uncomfortable.  I can't imagine children dealing with this type of territorial reaction.\n\nOP needed to refer this to his wife, without escalating it.  And the two of them need to get to the root of why the father said the situation makes him uncomfortable, not just assume it is homophobia.  \n\nIn the end, the father having concerns about the place where his kids spend much of their time with their mother is a legitimate issue.  The father has an affirmative obligation to pay attention to his kids welfare and happiness.  \n\nIf it turns out to be homophobia, then it needs to be dealt with. But if it something else, it still needs to be addressed, and the father is 100% right to advocate for his children's place in the blended family.", "Then why not sit both of them down together, since it concerns the parenting of all of the children (OP and his wife's)? \n\nAgain you're inserting stuff into the story that hasn't happened. OP hasn't accused dad of being homophobic and neither am I, but it is a fair assumption that he may be (or is just being downright difficult for the sake of it). \n\nWhy are you assuming the boyfriend is a bad guy? Dad just said that he didn't know him, so he can't know whether he's a bad guy or not.", "Fair enough. We don't have a landline.", "You're not wrong. They don't like talking to each other though. I don't like talking to him either, but such is life.", "Yeah, in future just say I don\u2019t know discuss it with my wife\u2019s lawyer.", "For sure. I\u2019m just saying he could be an LGBT-inclusive creep who assumes all other men are creeps.", "This sentiment exactly. They're openly going after Trans, next up is most likely guys, then more bipoc.\nAnything other than people than look like Warren Buffet will be suspect.", "And it looks really bad when you don't even have them for the time you have. \n\nMost people looking to get more custody for their kids are using right of first refusal to get as much time as they can.", "It would have been if op didn\u2019t nip it in the bud. They have the kids most of the time and the step kids dad didn\u2019t want ops son to have his bf when his kids were with the wife. That would\u2019ve been taking it out on him", "The boyfriend, or OP's son, doesn't have to be the \"bad guy\" in order for there to be issues with the children's comfort and the way the blended family functions.\n\nThe children's father is concerned, and the children's living situation is absolutely his business.\n\n***OP gets an AH for telling a parent that their children's living situation is none of their business. It is, and will always be, the father's business.***", "So he called your personal phone?", "Ah. Well if she prefers you talk to him, then I change my vote. NTA.", "Agreed. OP is right in not letting the guy interfere in his son\u2019s relationship. But antagonizing him isn\u2019t doing his wife any favors.", "NTA - it's none of his business what your son does.", "I mean people having the view of men are creeps plays into the fear mongering that gay men are out there to groom children, so one does support the other even if the dad doesn't think he is homophobic his trains of thought upholds it.", "He\u2019s the unicorn parent that doesn\u2019t want his kids to be near other people and wants them to spend more time alone with screens, learning \u2018just a prank bro\u2019 from TikTok?\n\nNahhh.\n\nI\u2019m a devils advocate for a lot of things but being uniquely concerned about a sibling\u2019s boyfriend as a predator? A real parent concern would be hearing your teenagers having sex, not that he\u2019s dating a diddler.", "That's my immediate assumption. Because men are untrustworthy creeps. \nI know, I am one, and the amount of times it's been proven that other dudes are awful and care for little more than getting their dick wet, damn the consequences, is more than I can count. I do not trust any man around my wife. Thankfully, I trust my wife", "Me too. I have lived here most my life  and hate that DeSantis has gone backwards for women and LGBT+ people.", "It's surreal to think about how I grew up thinking Florida was some kind of gay mecca.", "Only if they name Miami Beach \"Cockerland,\" and the staff uniform is baggy plaid shorts, a shirt in a different plaid, Panama hats with a band and that doesn't match the shirt or the shorts, sandals, and white socks.\n\nAnd re-open Wolfies.\n\nAnd the hidden speakers play Two Live Jews' *Oy It's So Humid!\"", "I don't understand where people are getting the idea that \"don't engage\" is the same as \"give into his bigoted demands\". I'm saying don't give in and don't engage. Ignore him like he's a toddler throwing a tantrum.", "What else would he be calling?", "Yes", "This is a lot of words to say \u201cother men shouldn\u2019t trust me around their wives.\u201d", "Damn you have some internalized misandry to work through"]}
