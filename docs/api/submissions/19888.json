Waaay too often girls are not believed in these situations. Again, you may find out that the kids are fine with the BF and this is the dad being an ah, but you cannot jump to conclusions.

This guy is homophobic and doesn't want his other kids to \"catch the gay\" - it's why he called YOU, not his ex wife, to talk to about this.

He and your wife are co-parents.  He needs to discuss this with her, not you. You should have referred him to his wife to discuss his concerns about things related to his kids.\n2. You should have then promptly gone to your wife, to give her a heads up about the issue, and make sure the two of you are in agreement about the household.\n3. There doesn't have to be anything bad happening for dating teenagers to make a place uncomfortable for younger kids. You may need to discuss boundaries with your son, such as \"no necking (or whatever kids are calling it today) in front of the younger kids.  Take it someplace private.\" And be sure that the teenagers have options with reasonable privacy from the younger kids.\n4. If anything is making the younger kids uncomfortable, they probably won't be confiding in you about it, because they know you'll (properly) prioritize your son.  Depending on the dynamics of the household, they may not feel comfortable discussing it with your wife, their mother.  They may have confided their concerns with their father.  Which would not be an inappropriate thing for kids to do. \n5. If the kids confided in their father about a dynamic in your household that is making them unhappy or uncomfortable, this needs to be addressed by you and your wife, together, considering the needs of both sets of kids. \n6. This may not be the teenagers doing anything bad to the younger kids.  It may be as simple as the older kids monopolizing the living room tv with shows that don't interest younger kids. Knowing about such problems and sorting them is necessary.  You didn't take the time to find out specifics of what the father was concerned about.\n7. If the father does take this to court, the burden of dealing with that will fall primarily on your wife, not you.  Escalating this and causing her problems should be a last resort, and you let this get to the point of the father threatening court without your wife even knowing what is going on. Which goes back to the need for points 1 and 2. \n8. Are you and your wife leaving the younger kids alone with your son and his boyfriend?  The father wanting you or your wife, as adults, to be around when your teenage son has friends his age over (dating, or just friends to hang out) would not be an unreasonable request from the father.", "E S H.

You say \u201ccut a long story short\u201d which I get for word count, but it would be good to know if there is anymore information that might be missing here that helps form judgements.

Virulent and outspoken hatred has become a lifestyle for too many people, I'm so used to the community being harassed, it's hard not to leap to their defense. However, real life and real custody situations can be a lot more nuanced than you might think, and it's important to get to the truth of the matter.", "One of the few sane comments on this post. I believe that the majority of users who are criticizing the father's attitude do not have children or they are teenagers without any experience of life outside the internet.", "What conversation is there to be had here? Honest question.", "At the very least, this situation should have been approached with more curiosity or even a compromise to address the stated concern of an unknown older boy around the kids with more adult supervision for the younger ones only. If the problem really is homophobia, then fuck him, but if it\u2019s a safety concern, OP is TA for not working to coparent peacefully.", "He did not threaten to reduce his days with the kids.\n\nHe called him out for not having the kids on all the days they are supposed to be with him in the first place. He wants to take her to court for more time when he doesn't currently use the time he does have? Laughable.\n\nThis decision involves HIS kid as well. So while he could have talked to his wife about it, he wasn't wrong for standing up for his son.", "No. Don\u2019t humor the homophobes", "Because he called the OP. And how does everyone suck, what was he supposed to do, reply that yes, of course, I will stop my child bringing his partner over, as the entitled homophobe demands?", "Because the dad specifically called *OP* to antagonize him.", "If OP had a *daughter* with a boyfriend, would you still stay that the stepchildren's father would need to sit down and meet with him? I mean, as far as we know, the other dad is a practical stranger to OP's biological kid, so why on earth would they need to have a get-together with him and their significant other?\n\nThat just seems incredibly weird to me.", "Or if the son was just bringing home his straight male best friend?", "I think the real question to ask to determine homophobia vs \u201cmen are creeps\u201d or something, would be\u2014if OP\u2019s son was a daughter bring home her boyfriend, would the ex have the same issue?\n\nIf it\u2019s the latter, ex is telling on himself a bit.", "Sure, he can create drama for them, that's always on the table when it comes to custody.  But that drama is trivial next to capitulating to a homophobe.", "There\u2019s a near 0% chance this ends up back in court. The ex would be laughed out of the court room asking for more custody when he doesn\u2019t even have the kids for all of his currently awarded custodial time. And no lawyer in their right mind would agree to represent him if he tried anyway", "That's all true, except **family court judges have seen it ALL**. That judge will absolutely clue in to his homophobia, and probably dismantle his arguments with more speed, grace, and aplomb than even OP managed in one phone call.", "Why should he tolerate bio dad's comments? It's none of his business. It's not his kid!", "Unless you end up with a bigoted judge, unfortunately.", "I don't mean that the court would make the guy relinquish his rights because of his views. I more meant that it sounds like he's already not using his custody days so who knows if there are other things which would make the court go \"well, actually, it seems better for more custody to go to your ex\".", "How about what exactly did the kids say? \n\nEveryone immediately jumps to \u201chomophobia\u201d .... there\u2019s literally no information in here about these kids & what they actually reported. The Dad said he\u2019s concerned about his kids around an older boy that he doesn\u2019t know. Would that be a valid conversation if ex was parading men in & out of her home? Yes....\n\nFor all anyone knows OP\u2019s son\u2019s boyfriend is a bully to step-kids.\n\nEdit", "I have an ex wife. Always be mindful of what you say in those situations.  It's her home too not just OP's. Technically she should have been the one to tell her ex to mind his business.", "Oh for sure but also don\u2019t digress to an ego war. That\u2019s not at all addressing the issue.\n\nHaving a civil conversation doesn\u2019t mean humouring him. I\u2019d just say \u2018They\u2019re teenagers, it\u2019s fine. I manage who is in the house fine.\u2019\n\nIf he goes into them being gay - you set that straight (no pun intended).", "He could have worded it differently.  If the ex wants to be an ass it's his wife who has to deal with it not OP. OP isn't wrong for ignoring the demand though.", "I think he should have left the coparenting of his wife\u2019s children to his wife. \n\nObviously his son\u2019s boyfriend should be allowed over. That doesn\u2019t mean this was handled well.", "It seems like there are very blurred lines between the three of them, which is not good. All three of them are responsible for maintaining healthy boundaries.", "Also very true.", "He has no authority to tell you how to run your family unless his children are being mistreated. You have the right to set such a limit. Though he might have discussed it with his ex, you could have expressed it in a kinder way.", "I don't know where OP is, and neither do you. All I know is that there are states in the US where I am no longer confident that the father wouldn't prevail because his reasoning is obviously homophobic.\n\nPlease understand that a law has been passed in Florida that if a parent with custody is allowing a child to even socially transition (change name, clothing, hairstyle) that a non-custodial parent who kidnaps the child and takes them to Florida will not be required to return the child. Florida will not enforce other states' custody orders if the child says they are trans and the custodial parent supports it.\n\nI realize that there is a difference between being trans and being gay. I also realize that trans people are an easy target, and that most people who hate one hate the other as well.", "Oh, some lawyer undoubtedly *would*, but that speaks more to the greed of some lawyers than any validity to bio-dad's position.", "I mean I don't think he'd win (and is an asshole) but many lawyers would absolutely represent him if he paid them money tbh", "One would hope, but they can still drag them into court repeatedly on spurious issues without crossing the line to harassment.", "I didn't say he should. But *how* OP engaged the situation is wrong.", "I'm saying that the bigoted ex can't have their parental rights or custody taken away just because they're a bigot. It's not PC or socially promoted, but it's not illegal. A bigoted judge isn't going to punish someone who shares their views, in fact they might reward the behavior, which is why OP needs to be careful.", "> *\"The Dad said he\u2019s concerned about his kids around an older man.\"*\n\nI like how you changed the description in the actual post, which was \"older *boy*\" to \"older *man*\" in order to make it seem more threatening.", "> *\"there\u2019s literally no information in here about these kids & what they actually reported.\"*\n\nBut that clearly doesn't stop you from creating your own narrative about the situation, which, so far, is that the boyfriend is apparently an older man who babysits the kids all day and bullies them.\n\nSheesh.", "Well that would have been the point of contention though. It wasn't as far as is said. The guy didn't call up saying his kids were getting bullied. He said he was concerned about a guy he doesn't know? With a house full of parents? \n\nIt's fair to say there isn't enough info.", "The ex just said an older boy, not older man. This is a teenager so not the same thing in your example. And if it was that the boyfriend was a bully the ex would have said that. You\u2019re reaching for straws on this for why the ex isn\u2019t homophobic.", "He called him though and not her.\n\nWith the situation involving his son as well.\n\nBut I see your point.", "> OP isn't wrong for ignoring the demand\n\nI do agree, but *how* he handled it was just plain awful.", "Considering the wife says he's the asshole seems like she would more then likely try pacify the ex to keep the peace which isn't always the best resolve. OP is right their children are in his house and they are co-parenting, as long as the mother is fine with what's happening and the kids aren't in any danger then the father doesn't get a say. Also he was the one to reach out to OP not the other way round just seems like he's homophobic tbh.", "Ma\u2019am, this is a Wendy\u2019s.\n\nI\u2019m not OP, the comment I\u2019m replying to isn\u2019t OP, and the comment *they\u2019re* replying to also is not OP.", "And I didn't think Florida could get worse Jesus Christ I wish the mouse would just take over the damn state and turn it into the Disney state", "My father tried to do exactly that. Dude got financially bodyslammed by that judge like a Mexican wrestler. Like, the judge went \"full-on Bam-Bam\". My mama's lawyers were laughing their asses off over it. So I'll just say it again: *family court judges have seen it ALL*.", "I asked OP what the ages of all these kids are... But you\u2019re right it is written \u201cboy\u201d. I changed it. Still doesn\u2019t change my opinion. \n\nIt is not crazy for custodial parents to ask questions & raise concerns about their children. OP should have just handed his wife the phone. Why is it so challenging to have an adult conversation? Should be everyone\u2019s goal to be on the same page for the well-being of all these kids.", "Again.... there\u2019s no information here. I\u2019m doing exactly what everyone else is doing creating my own narrative. Sure maybe the dude is homophobic or maybe a million other things. Who knows! That\u2019s my point. \n\nThere\u2019s no information in this post about either implied or stated homophobia & OP was not talking about his own kid. He was speaking to the father of his wife\u2019s kids & states when step-kids ..\u201dare with wife, she makes the decisions\u201d ... so why didn\u2019t he hand the phone to his wife?!? He was not talking about his own son.", "The guy he doesn\u2019t know could be babysitting his kids everyday.... who knows?", "I\u2019m not reaching \u2014 I\u2019m saying there\u2019s no information in which to determine anything about the intent of this conversation other than what was reported. The guy has a concern about a stranger being around his kids too much. \n\nNo one knows what these kids said to their Dad.", "His attitude towards the ex, justified or not, will affect her. Hopefully, there won't be any kind of fallout.", "Agreed. I really hope his wife's ex is just all talk.", "OP needs to have that argument with his wife, not her crazy ex. One simple comment about it being his home is understandable, but his wife and her ex have to discuss the coparenting aspect. If his wife would try to pacify the ex to keep the peace, that\u2019s something OP would need to talk with her about as well. They aren\u2019t his kids.", "With the moms blessing.", "Then the ex shouldn't ring OP he should ring the wife.", "That\u2019s true. Maybe there\u2019s some information missing here about why he\u2019s calling OP? \ud83e\udd14 If so, then I think OP is in the right. Otherwise the ex should be calling the wife."]}
