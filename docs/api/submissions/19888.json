Waaay too often girls are not believed in these situations. Again, you may find out that the kids are fine with the BF and this is the dad being an ah, but you cannot jump to conclusions.

He and your wife are co-parents.  He needs to discuss this with her, not you. You should have referred him to his wife to discuss his concerns about things related to his kids.\n2. You should have then promptly gone to your wife, to give her a heads up about the issue, and make sure the two of you are in agreement about the household.\n3. There doesn't have to be anything bad happening for dating teenagers to make a place uncomfortable for younger kids. You may need to discuss boundaries with your son, such as \"no necking (or whatever kids are calling it today) in front of the younger kids.  Take it someplace private.\" And be sure that the teenagers have options with reasonable privacy from the younger kids.\n4. If anything is making the younger kids uncomfortable, they probably won't be confiding in you about it, because they know you'll (properly) prioritize your son.  Depending on the dynamics of the household, they may not feel comfortable discussing it with your wife, their mother.  They may have confided their concerns with their father.  Which would not be an inappropriate thing for kids to do. \n5. If the kids confided in their father about a dynamic in your household that is making them unhappy or uncomfortable, this needs to be addressed by you and your wife, together, considering the needs of both sets of kids. \n6. This may not be the teenagers doing anything bad to the younger kids.  It may be as simple as the older kids monopolizing the living room tv with shows that don't interest younger kids. Knowing about such problems and sorting them is necessary.  You didn't take the time to find out specifics of what the father was concerned about.\n7. If the father does take this to court, the burden of dealing with that will fall primarily on your wife, not you.  Escalating this and causing her problems should be a last resort, and you let this get to the point of the father threatening court without your wife even knowing what is going on. Which goes back to the need for points 1 and 2. \n8. Are you and your wife leaving the younger kids alone with your son and his boyfriend?  The father wanting you or your wife, as adults, to be around when your teenage son has friends his age over (dating, or just friends to hang out) would not be an unreasonable request from the father.", "E S H.

Is there anything else I can do to make you feel more comfortable?\u201d \n\nBeing an outright dick to a concerned father (and I don\u2019t care why they were concerned) is never the way.", "For someone complaining about people making leaps you\u2019re sure making a lot of leaps. There\u2019s no indication the kids said anything. No one said the kids were being left alone with the older boy, just that he was present in the home. No one said the kids \u201cJOINTLY\u201d did anything. If the kids came together and complained, why would bio dad be calling OP and not going straight to the mom?", "nah it sounds more like they were just talking about stuff they did at home with their stepbrother and mentioned the boyfriends name. then the bio dad was like \u201cwho\u2019s that\u201d and they told him. it\u2019s not automatically homophobia, but be real, if it was a straight girl he wouldn\u2019t have said anything.", ">He should never have called you. He should have addressed his issues with your wife.\n\nHe was concerned about OP's son's older boyfriend being around the kids a lot, so I can see why on this one the ex called OP as someone who'd best know the parties involved. Maybe he just wanted OP to give some reassurance that his son's boyfriend is a good kid, that boundaries are enforced (he's not babysitting / alone with the other kids frequently, or he's really good at it, etc). Because OP would be much more likely to know that than the ex.\n\nI don't know the situation at all here, but it sounds like there's a lot of acrimony from the past. And I wonder if OP immediately assumed a fight, when the guy here just wanted INFO. But again, I should also not try to infer things too much.", "No one said the kids said that they were uncomfortable. The bio dad says that he is uncomfortable. Would he be reacting the same way if it was a girlfriend that was over?", "I would take heat for my kids alot when they were younger. It's easier to say, I have a problem with this then to tell the step dad something they told their dad in confidence.", "My family does. So do a lot of people who own businesses and run them from home. Just because it\u2019s not in your line of sight, doesn\u2019t meant it doesn\u2019t exist.", "Eh, unfortunately this isn't true across the board.  It SHOULD BE the case, but is not.", "Going by all the Y.T.A and E.S.H votes on this thread, so do a lot of redditors.", "That's valid. I just haven't seen one in a while.", "That is something the biological mother should be doing.  The stepfather needs to bud out.", "Then that sounds like a concern to bring up to his ex-wife, not OP, seeing as how the ex-wife has primary custody.", "I have a relative move to Florida about 30 years ago because he was gay.", "That's very true..however my point is that it doesn't warrant the very ott reaction from the op and whilst he gets to skip off into the sunset, his son, the other kids and his wife will be the ones dealing with the fallout. He could have handled this in a morenposifhe and collaborative way with maturity and grace that de escalated the situation. Op should have just told him to talk to the wife.", "No, no forcing please.  If the parent doesn't want it, it's just awful for the kid.\n\nDocument every single custody day that's not taken for sure.  Do not force a dang thing.", "Why didn't bio dad have this conversation with bio mom? My ex would never had initiated a conversation of that nature with my husband. Had he, I would have torn him a new asshole.", "YTA - it\u2019s not your fight. As much as your stance is correct, you\u2019re only asking about how you spoke to him", "NTA. Your son is dating another kid, presumably close to his own age, not a sex offender or convicted criminal. Would bio-dad have an issue if this boy was just a close friend and not a boyfriend? I doubt it! You did \"antagonize\" him, he called you trying to start some shit and you shut him down. Sounds like daddy doesn't care so much about his kids as he does about exerting some kind of control over you and his ex. \n\nTell your wife she needs to stand up to this ignorant ass instead of letting him walk all over her and try to dictate what goes on in HER (and your) house! I assume there's a good reason why he is now her ex. She needs to stop placating him or he will think he can walk all over all of you! Honestly, it sounds like maybe your wife needs to take HIM back to court and get his visits lessened!", "There comes a time in everybody's life when you have to tell someone to \"F\\*ck off and die\".  We all hate coming to that point but sometimes that last button is pushed and you have no other option.   \n\nYou are correct about my house and my rules but it seems you were not given a meeting point; just a demand. \n\nMentioning he does not make his visitation time a priority with his kids drove home his \"My rules not your rules\" attitude.\n\nNTA.  Stay the course and DOCUMENT EVERYTHING!", "I would think the first conversation you should is with kids when they get home, see how they feel", "Would he feel the same if your son was having a girlfriend over regularly? Doubtful. Would he feel the same if you had a daughter that invited her boyfriend over regularly? Again, doubtful. He is just being a homophobe and trying to teach your step kids to be homophobic. \nAs long as your son and his boyfriend are respectful of the rest of the family, there should be no problem whatsoever. (That should be the case for any friend, girlfriend, boyfriend that any of the kids being home, or the parents for that matter. Any guest in your home should be respectful of the rest of the family. No making out or anything inappropriate in front of the family.) You are correct that it is not any of her ex\u2019s business. She needs to stand her ground with him, with you backing her up. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d", "Might just be lacking details here but I\u2019m going to have to say YTA- you did not ask where these concerns came from, did not make any effort to constructively discuss the issue or inquire as to why it\u2019s a problem, you just rubbed his face in the idea that he has no control over half of his kids life (which is categorically false and a *terrible* approach to co-parenting between separated parents) and only escalated the issue pointlessly to make things more difficult for your partner \n\nIs it possible he\u2019s just being a homophobe here? Sure, totally possible. But also possible it\u2019s something specifically about this person that the kids mentioned to him. It\u2019s also possible he just found out they\u2019re around him without supervision, and he just simply wants to know who this person is. \n\nYou didn\u2019t attempt to work through any of this did you? Just immediately made it personal and nasty, and made it clear you\u2019ll do whatever the fuck you want when it comes to his kids. \u201cLacking tact\u201d is an understatement, even if you 100% disagree with him there are so many better ways to come to an understanding than the way you handled this\n\nSo it\u2019s not necessarily \u201cwho is in the right\u201d,  it very well could be you who\u2019s right here, but you handled it terribly from the way you described this going down", "YTA. He is their father and he had a concern about who spends time around his children. You could have addressed it like an adult and shown a modicum of concern for his kids (\u201cHas something happened that the kids didn\u2019t share with us? Have they expressed discomfort themselves, or is it that this person is unknown to you?\u201d)  Instead, you made it about you with the your house/your rules position, insulted him and upset your wife. You didn\u2019t need to do any of those things. If this becomes a bigger conflict, it\u2019s because you handled the situation so poorly.", "Where are you getting \"older adult male\" from, or that the kids are uncomfortable? OP clearly refers to his son's boyfriend as \"an older boy\", and that this dude's presence is making the **ex** uncomfortable, not the ex's kids.", "Hey weirdo why are you refusing to reveal the age of the boyfriend", "The kid\u2019s perspective \u201colder boy\u201d would be seen as a man to young children. Yes he might be a teen, but to young kids the two are essentially the same", "Exactly this. I live in a very blue state and still know several people that think like the bio father. They're not blatantly homophobic in public, but it's an entirely different issue for them when it hits close to home.", "You're making assumptions about a situation where there isn't nearly enough context. And then you're calling me a homophobe for just pointing that out. You're just a judgmental prick.", "We have no idea whether OP's stepkids are \"young kids\" - for all we know they could also be teens wanting to cause shit for their stepbrother.", "Eh.  All it takes is one shitty judge and stuff like that won't matter.  Facts don't matter if a judge decides otherwise.\n\nIt's a terrible system.", "You don't know what the kids told him.  The stepfather should have kept his mouth shut and handed the phone to the mother.", "> The only common denominator is the male.\n\nThat would only be true if gay men were grooming and being predatory like the outcry, you can't compare one group doing something to another being accused of doing something...", "Your reading comprehension must not be that good, so let me explain something to you. The original post does not say anywhere that the kids are uncomfortable in the presence of OP's son's boyfriend. It only says that they told their dad that he's over there often. The dad is the one who's uncomfortable with it, and he has given absolutely no good reason for that. \n\nIt is nowhere implied in the story that the kids may have been abused by this person, or that they dislike being around him.", "I'm not? I already said he's seventeen. I got almost a thousand comments on this post. I can't possibly read them all quickly. Sorry if you asked earlier and I didn't see it.", "What's your point, bro? Even if he thinks that, which was not a widespread idea before current idiocy, it's not an excuse. This is a kid, a teenager, a child, and if he had said that about my sons boyfriend, he'd be counting his teeth.", "It doesn't matter if I (the father) am not present in their lives... as long as they are not exposed to that one gay! /obvious s", "As a parent who coparented with ex/step and now a step myself, absolutely correct. \n\nCommunication with the bio parents needs to stay between the bio parents. Parenting choices need to be communicated by the bio parents. \n\nSteps would help a lot by stepping back from that part of parenting. \n\nI know it\u2019s not easy but it\u2019s necessary.", "Even if that are older (preteenish), I wouldn't be surprised if they were more comfortable talking to bio dad if they were bothered by something in this case, dad is not in the household so may be less biased and willing to take the fall on this for the sake of his kids. For sure it's most likely prejudice, but to dismiss it without taking to the younger kids first is foolish.", "Or one of the ex's kids is homophobic, or just has conflict with OP's son and wants to cause drama, or maybe the ex is just looking to stir shit. \n\nI am so disgusted by how many posters are insinuating that this \"older boy\" who is going out with OP's son is somehow a risk to the stepkids with zero evidence to that effect and jumping merrily onto the \"gays are predators\" trope.", "Why is everyone making GAY the factor when the only evidence we have is that his AGE is the factor??\n\nWith how much OP clearly dislikes bio dad, why would he not take the opportunity to blast dad for being homophobic? It\u2019s nonsensical to believe he left out that detail while trying to paint dad as bad and himself as good\u2026\n\nIt is so weird to have the mere mention of someone being gay negate all of the actual evidence in someone\u2019s post and have so many people jump to baseless conclusions", "Fwiw, there's no indication that the kids are uncomfortable.", "the kids aren\u2019t uncomfortable. the bio dad said he feels uncomfortable about it", "OP has stated both his bio son and the \"older boy\" is also 16."]}
