{"id": 812, "submission_id": "yjr6x0", "title": "AITA for not wanting to split 50/50", "selftext": "I (F26) have been seeing my boyfriend (M28) for a few years now. He owns the apartment he lives in while I\u2019m finishing uni this semester and will start making a decent salary from January. He has wanted me to move in for a while now, which I would be excited to do, but we have some differences in opinions that we have a hard time settling on.\n\nHe wants to split costs (his monthly mortgage downpayments plus bills and groceries etc) 50/50 as we will be making around the same amount. I don\u2019t agree with this as it is his apartment, and by default I will be paying down his mortgage and will be left with nothing if we break up, while he will have his house and interest from its rise in value. I proposed that I can pay 50/50 of all expenses as well as half of the interest rate, but not contribute to the mortgage payment of his loan. This way I can put the rest of money into savings so when my savings are big enough we can go in on an apartment together that will be in interest for the both of us (or I can buy a share into his existing apartment).\n\nHe thinks it\u2019s unreasonable that we wouldn\u2019t pay the same monthly expenses when we both make the same and that I am focusing too much on what is mine and what is his. He has made small digs, hinting that I am trying to leech off of his investments by getting a cheaper place to live \u2013 which I don\u2019t think is the case. I find that splitting everything 50/50 disproportionately advantages him and basically results in me paying down a loan that I have no interest in.\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: first of all thank you so much for all the response! It\u2019s really interesting to see how people see things so differently. Here are a few clarifications on some things that are brought up in the comments\n- I will not be having \u201cfree rent\u201d, the interest rate is quite significant as well as fees related to the apartment complex plus insurances etc. It is only the actual mortgage portion (aka the equity part) that is a matter of dispute. His expenses will be significantly lower if I move in than him living by himself as he is currently\n- I am not currently homeless and living in a flat with three friends where I don\u2019t mind to continue living\n- For everyone saying I would be paying down a landlords mortgage regardless, that is true, but our relationship is not a landlord-tenant relationship where the goal is for the landlord to profit off of its tenants. And this might be me that is being absolutely too stubborn - but yes, I would rather want to pay the mortgage of a landlord than have my boyfriend actively profiting off of me. Because that would be a formal agreement with more stability, and it would be within its nature to be profitable for one party. It doesn\u2019t sit right with me that our living situation would be an agreement that my boyfriend would profit off of.\n\nAnother clarification:\n- half of the expenses are still more than what I am paying in my current living situation\n\nAdditional clarification:\n- he is not willing to enter an agreement where my rent goes into equity so I can gradually buy my way into the house\n- there still seem to be a lot of confusion about the \u00abfree rent\u00a0\u00bb part, and I don\u2019t think people realize how much of your monthly expenses are tied to interests and other costs such as insurance and fees connected to the complex. What I\u2019m proposing is about 40/60, it is only the principal payment of the loan which is of dispute - which is the direct payment of his loan that is increasing his equity\n\nSmall edit: removed the part about what it would cost to live alone as it seemed to be confusing people. Living with my current roommates in our flat for a lower rent is the alternative option. Sorry about any confusion.\n\nUpdate: We have concluded that we will not live together as of now, and I will continue to stay in my flat until I have saved up enough to where we can look into buying a place together. We have also set up a session with our bank to get some further advice. As questions of finances often are, it is much more about on agreeing on how finances should be dealt with in the long run than the actual dollar amount. I do believe it is important to have these conversations early on and stand your ground where you think it is right to avoid further disputes in the future. My goal is to save up money to buy a shared apartment as soon as possible, so it is ultimately better to stay put and have a lower rent with my friends. Things would obviously be less complicated if we were renting and collectively saving up for a down payment for our first home together, but that is not the situation we\u00b4re in. Buying a property is an important financial priority of mine and he is not in on parts of the rent going into equity, so we will leave it for now.\n\nThank you for all the input and proposals for different solutions! Again, very interesting to see how everyone\u00b4s take is so different on this, and a lot to take in for the future. There is room for more flexibility, although 50/50 without any equity or any other supplementary agreement is not going to work for me:) (and is something I would advise anyone to be cautious of going into any long-term living agreement with a partner)\nWish you all the best!", "created_utc": 1667351259, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjr6x0/aita_for_not_wanting_to_split_5050/", "score": 3914, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You would be helping him invest in an asset that only he stands to profit from. Without an equal split of the profit, why would you agree to an equal split of the payment? You should definitely contribute financially in some way, but splitting the mortgage payment 50/50 assumes that all other things are equal, and they are not. In the event of a breakup, you walk away with nothing. He walks away with the totality of all payments made towards the principal by both of you, as well as all profit from increased home value. Unless he is giving you a cut of the equity, you need to negotiate a split that takes all factors into account.", "INFO: What protections would you have if you broke up?

Keep paying rent to your landlord. \nProblem solved.", "NAH. \n\nI have lived in my (now) husband\u2019s place and paid rent. And I feel exactly like you do based on how you said it. \n\nThe difference is we had a formal agreement and an extra bedroom, so if we broke up, i was given 90 days and other legal protections. His dad is a lawyer, and we had written in how if we got married, I would then have equity in the home equal to the rent I had paid (rent and utilities were separate), and his dad added a bunch of legal protections for ME that I hadn\u2019t thought about. Basically if my then boyfriend decided to do something like cheat or whatever, he couldn\u2019t evict me without X days notice. (I love my FIL.)\n\nThere is a way to do what your boyfriend wants AND protect yourself. Get a legal tenancy agreement written up, and separate it from your relationship if you can. My husband was on board from the beginning, so it didn\u2019t feel weird. He wanted me protected, too. But I lived there so I needed to contribute to living there. And we found a way to protect us both, thanks to FIL. \n\nWe sold that place and bought our dream home after we got married. And equity didn\u2019t matter because it worked out, but if you\u2019re paying rent, you need the protections of a renter. He can\u2019t have his cake and eat it, too - and he should be amenable to a contract that protects you both if that\u2019s really what this is about. \n\nConsider this a blessing - insist on a rental agreement that protects both of you and see how it plays out.

You would be paying to rent elsewhere, him being your SO shouldn't exempt you from that expense.\n\nHowever, in this case. IF he is benefitting from you paying towards his mortage, you will need to get a contractual tenant agreement.  And the biggest stipulation is HE will be 100% responsible for ALL repairs, maintenance, and upgrade costs.  You paying rent makes you a tenant/boarder.  He needs to be willing to take full responsibility as the property owner in this sense.", "NTA stay in your own place. This won't end well and he knows it.", "NAH.\n\nThis sort of thing comes up all the time in this sub, and your solution\u2014paying into savings each month and then putting that money towards buying a place together\u2014is one of the most level-headed I\u2019ve seen.\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly reasonable to not want your partner to be your \u201clandlord,\u201d as it adds a level of transactionality to the relationship that could feel off-putting.  It\u2019s also reasonable for him to want you to contribute financially, because he doesn\u2019t want to feel like you\u2019re taking advantage of him.\n\nIf it\u2019s really only the principal that you feel awkward paying down, maybe suggest that you put that specific amount into a separate savings account (not your regular savings) with the understanding that that money would go toward the purchase of a future apartment, or buying a share of his (only if he\u2019s willing to add you to the title)?", "I bought a 3br townhome early in my relationship with my now husband and had 2 roommates to help with the costs. At the time he was living in a 1br apartment. The amount he was paying for that apartment was just slightly higher than my roommates rent so when we were ready to move in together my roommates moved out and my now husband took over their share of rent (which was less than 50% of my mortgage). We split utilities roughly in half by choosing a set to transfer into his name. \n\nIn your case you should expect to split utilities 50/50. For the rent question, I\u2019d find some comparable properties in the area and see what they rent for. Half of that rent is roughly what you should expect to pay your boyfriend (not to exceed 50% of his mortgage). \n\nIt also helps to have an idea of where you go in the future. For us, the townhome was a starter place so we knew we\u2019d get a place together someday and started actively saving toward that. \n\nNAH", "NTA. There is middle ground to be had here but you shouldn\u2019t be paying half when he gets 100% of the equity.", "NAH. Continue to live with your friends. This isn't worth messing up a relationship over. You're both entitled to your feelings here. I wouldn't want a bf to be my landlord either, and I'm sure he isn't made of money and would want you to contribute. So just stay put.", "NAH. When you are salaried next year consider buying a property yourself. He is the one who keeps pushing for you to move in with him. Stability is more important and him pulling the guilt card about his equity doesn't sit right with me either. On paper it seems 'fair' but then he also has his thumb on the scale of your stability when you are only gf and bf. That is a significant piece of the puzzle that few are considering. Also you would be the one shouldering the cost of having to move and then moving again if things don't work out.", "NAH\n\nIt's tricky because you're both correct - You would be helping pay down his mortgage, BUT paying 'rent' somewhere does seem fair.  \n\nIt seems like as long as you are contributing an equal amount WHERE   your equal share goes shouldn't be that big a deal.  Also consider putting one or more of the utilities in YOUR name - that could be helpful for your 'adult life' as many things like getting a bank account or buying a car (they want to see an official document with your name and address on it)", "NTA.

But all of this financial talk is important to determine your future together. NAH imo I think there\u2019s a different way to figure out how to contribute. I can get he doesn\u2019t want you to feel like a freeloader if you move in, and he isn\u2019t really profiting from you paying since he\u2019s paying off debt for a giant loan.", "Say that's fine, however you want a contract that stated all funds you paid towards equity are paid back to you in the event you split up. If you were both on the title you'd receive half market value, so that proposal is fair. If you break up as is he  would get to keep to keep all funds you put in towards the mortgage and all equity gained. I would also note you are not responsible for any upkeep and that is 100% on him.", "The amount you should pay for monthly housing should not be based on the payment amount of a mortgage that isn't yours. it should be based on rental market value for the housing you're getting. If you weren't living with him, would you get the same kind of accommodation? What would it cost and would utilities, etc be included. Whatever that monthly outlay is, refuse to exceed it. Anything else is an investment in a property you have no title to.", "You are correct. To be fair you should pay half of market value for the apartment.\n\nOtherwise will you be paying for half of the homeowners insurance? Half of the taxes? Half of any repairs? Put down some money towards a down payment?\n\nYou should look into true cost of ownership. Because you, and a lot of people like you seem to think that people that own a house/apt are just getting free money with no risk. And that they are taking advantage of you if you pay half of the mortgage bill. Which would be a bit cheaper than rent.", "NAH. Cohabitation agreement. There was another thread about this yesterday. Come up with a legally binding agreement that protects you and him, not as a rental agreement, but more than that. I can't really sit here and say anyone is an asshole because relationships are complicated. The fact that you have reservations about moving in means maybe you're not at a point to share expenses. Compromises are essential to all relationships, but it's not always 50/50.\n\nIMO however, your boyfriend isn't profiting off of you splitting the mortgage any more than he'd be profiting if you both rented an apartment from someone else. Case and point, I just bought a house, my girlfriend lives here rent free. Granted, there are extenuating circumstances around that, but she at least does some chores around the house like laundry, dishes, general cleaning. Not to say that I don't do any chores, because I definitely do much more in general, but it's my house, I'm responsible for the upkeep. No one else is named on the mortgage. If she were contribute, whether it's 25%, 50% or whatever, it's not a financial gain for me alone. She can also walk out tomorrow and I'm right back to square one of paying it by myself.\n\nThe bigger picture that I would say is important to keep in mind is that it's inherently more expensive for two people to live somewhere. There's more wear and tear on the house. It's twice the amount of people using all the appliances, wearing the carpet, etc. I would recommend to not look at it as your boyfriend profiting off being able to spend less directly on the mortgage every month, but it can translate towards a washing machine failing sooner, carpet needing to be replaced sooner. I'm not saying that there's a mathematical specific where something will need to be replaced when two people use it vs one, but there is a bigger picture. Would you split the cost of having to replace the refrigerator? In many respects there's even less long term equity in it for you by contributing to that compared to contributing towards half of the living space.\n\nI made sure my girlfriend has a space in the house that is loosely speaking, hers. It's not off limits to me, but her desk is there with her consoles and computer. My desk is in a completely separate part of the house. Rather than hold steadfast towards not wanting to contribute to the mortgage, make sure part of the arrangement includes a space that would generally speaking be considered your space. In your currently living arrangement, chances are you have your own bedroom. Obviously with couples you don't really have your own bedroom (some do, no judgement, it's just not the majority in \\*my\\* experience), but if you can claim a specific area to be yours that you control, that may long term be a better way of reaching an agreement because now your contribution results in a \"private\" space that is yours, not just the overall general living space. It doesn't have to be 50%, it could be 20 or 25% and you can draw that imaginary line in the sand and make it more clear about what kind of privacy you're getting for that cost vs where you are now.\n\nI understand that there are many apartments that don't have the space for this, but room dividers exist for a reason, there is a way that this can be done in a relatively elegant fashion even in a small space. Then your contributions translate into something more tangible for you. Monetarily it may cost more than splitting an apartment with 2 or 3 other people, but that's also the cost of having a more private space with a significant other. Maybe that investment is worth it to you, maybe it's not.", "NTA he has wanted you to move in for awhile now but why?

If it\u2019s really about what benefits her financially she can argue that she pays the same rent she does right now with a rental agreement to her boyfriend if she was to move in with him so that they both can financially benefit.\n\nEDIT2: so I don\u2019t have to repeat this. OP EDITED HER ORIGINAL POST. In the original post she said that living with him would be cheaper than living on her own. Idk about you guys but I consider \u201cliving on my own\u201d to be living separate from my family and that includes living with roommates. So basically the context of the original post was that it would\u2019ve already been cheaper to live with him and she wanted to pay even less. I still think OP is TA because she\u2019s pushing for partial ownership of his home basically which he might not be ready for based on the progress of their relationship. They\u2019ve never even lived together before and she wants a lot of financial commitment on his part. I don\u2019t think OP is the AH for wanting to pay less RENT, which is why I suggested that she offer to pay him her current rental rate with a rental agreement so that she it doesn\u2019t cost her financially and they can progress their relationship to the point where he might get comfortable making further financial commitments to their relationship. If OP isn\u2019t ok with that that\u2019s fine but she shouldn\u2019t bother moving in with him if they can\u2019t come to an agreement.\n\nEDIT 3: nvm NTA, with OP\u2019s current edits her boyfriend is just being cheap AH.

He owns the apartment he lives in while I`m finishing uni this semester and will start making a decent salary from January. He has wanted me to move in for a while now, which I would be excited to do, but we have some differences in opinions that we have a hard time settling on.\nHe wants to split costs (his monthly mortgage downpayments plus bills and groceries etc) 50/50 as we will be making around the same amount. I don`t agree with this as it is his apartment, and by default I will be paying down his mortgage and will be left with nothing if we break up, while he will have his house and interest from its rise in value. I proposed that I can pay 50/50 of all expenses as well as half of the interest rate, but not contribute to the mortgage payment of his loan. This way I can put the rest of money into savings so when my savings are big enough we can go in on an apartment together that will be in interest for the both of us (or I can buy a share into his existing apartment).\nHe thinks it`s unreasonable that we wouldn`t pay the same monthly expenses when we both make the same and that I am focusing too much on what is mine and what is his. Regardless, he says that rent will still be cheaper if we pay 50/50 than if I were to live on my own and then would have even less room to save. This is true, but the share of expenses still doesn`t sit right with me. He has made small digs, hinting that I am trying to leech off of his investments by getting a cheaper place to live \u2013 which I don`t think is the case. I find that splitting everything 50/50 disproportionately advantages him and basically results in me paying down a loan that I have no interest in.\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This is what we did and obviously this is just an avenue you can explore if you want.\n\nWe did a pre nup (or whatever it's called for non married couples) because at the end of the day, it only matters if you break up (well for us it was that). You can do them online, it's pretty easy.\n\nBasically what we agreed to is that whatever portion each person paid towards the house, is the portion that they own. Eg if my payments come to 30% of the total, I get 30% of whatever the house sells for. Now given you don't have anything on the deed of the house, I would write it more around getting the value of your share paid to you either on the selling of the house or you breaking up.\n\nEdit: NAH both of you have valid concerns and couples finance is tricky. It's about finding something that works for you.", "NTA\nHe's treating you like a roommate and not a partner which imo isn't a good sign in the relationship. After a few years it should be clear where the relationship is going. If you were his fianc\u00e9e or wife, your contribution to the mortgage would mean adding your name as an owner. Sharing other living expenses like utilities, groceries, etc make sense, but paying him rent sounds very off.", "I\u2019m probably going to get down voted for this. He doesn\u2019t love you. If he did this wouldn\u2019t even be a discussion. Keep your own place and your freedom until he\u2019s ready to fully commit to you. But honestly his comments he\u2019s made to you are things my husband would never say to me. No one would say that to someone they love and respect.", "Personally I think NTA. You shouldn\u2019t have to put towards his mortgage payments unless he puts your name as an owner of the apartment.", "Nta. Your name isn't on the house and you aren't married.  I'd live alone and save up money so you can buy your own place. \n\nI live in my partner's house but we worked out that when married my name won't be on the mortgage but in case of divorce or breakup I take what I brought. Furniture, etc. We will make a legally binding contract for us to sign that any money I put I to the house I would get back in case of divorce. \n\nIf your paying into the relationship you should leave with what you invested in it monetary wise. \n\nThat imo", "NTA. Tell him to sell his flat yesterday so you can invest somewhere together without all his capital being bound to him alone or to put you on the deed so you can pay for half the mortgage, or to keep paying his mortgage+interest alone forever.", "NTA. If he wants you to pay part of the mortgage, he needs to be a proper landlord. So have a formal contract, tenants rights and everything. All repairs and stuff are 100% on him then and so on. You just pay the monthly rent and that\u2019s it.", "NTA, although I know that Reddit will likely not agree with me on this. My husband and I have talked about this before (someone we know was in a similar situation, where her family put in the down payment and she and her bf paid the mortgage 50/50). She thought the flat should only be under her name because of the down payment while my husband and I both think that ownership should be proportional to their respective payments. So in your situation, if he wants 50% of the mortgage, part of the property should be yours (as it's not a landlord/tenant situation).", "SIS, save up your money and get your own place. dont waste your money where you wont anything.", "NTA. Honestly if you like your current situation, is cheaper and you want to save money for your own place it doesn\u2019t make sense to move with him and I feel you are not TA for not wanting to spend more on rent on something that is not yours. If you moving means him who owns a house having to pay half of what he pays and you having to pay more than what you pay all I see is a huge imbalance in your relationship. Don\u2019t do it! You can keep dating and move in together when it makes more sense, right now doesn\u2019t seems like is the right time in my opinion.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm going to give you advice as if I were your mama.  I'm annoying like this, I have 9 daughters and still I give advice to other young women.  Don't move in with him as long as money is the biggest issue.  Never live with anyone other than your family, friends, roommates or someone you love so much you can't live without him.    \n\n\nNow if you're sure you want to live with him I'll tell you that earlier today we had a thread from a young woman who is paying the mortgage on her house and her boyfriend lives there but only pays 1/2 utilities & 1/2 groceries.  And now he wants the only garage.  Overwhelmingly she was told he should be paying 1/2 the mortgage & she gets the garage.  \n\nI'm not going to tell you differently other than to say, you could tell him you're willing to pay him what you're paying in rent now.  If he's not willing to accept that then it's not time to live together.  This is only my opinion and what I would tell a daughter.  But they're all married now so....", "NTA.\n\nIt sounds as though your monthly expenses will rise significantly by moving in, and that your partners expenses will reduce proportionately.

Currently his offer is beneficial for him, but detrimental for you.", "NTA. What you propose is entirely reasonable and your bf is being grabby.

Why does he want you to be left with very little and why does he want to profit from you?\n\nDepending on what the law is in the country you live in, he would need to be very careful about what he suggests anyway as if in some places if you can demonstrate on a break up that you have contributed to the costs of the property you can claim an entitlement", "So your BF accuses you of trying to leech off of him, while trying to make you pay part of his mortgage without any part of ownership?

He's been wanting you to move in for a while, but it would seem to be more to ease his financial burden than to move your relationship to the next level. I would propose that you say to him that you'll pay him what you currently pay for rent, utilities, groceries etc. (and maybe a little extra) and how he choses to apportion that is up to him. He can't accuse you of leaching if it's costing you the same or more.", "100% your proposal is the most fair one. It\u2019s very simple. Say his mortgage is 1000 per month and 400 is interest, 600 is down payment. Unless the property market crashes, those 600 per month that he\u2019s paying into his mortgage is essentially the same as him putting them into a savings account. They are *not* a cost for him. So if you pay 200 for interests, he pays 200 for interests, he pays 600 to his mortgage and you put 600 in a savings account, you end up with having paid and having saved exactly the same - except on top of that, he gets any price increase of the home to himself. He comes out on top anyway.", "NTA\u2026. Either he takes one of your many options, or, you don\u2019t move in\u2026 period. You offered to pay taxes in lieu of paying half his mortgage. There is NO WAY I\u2019d be paying half of someone\u2019s mortgage unless my name is on the deed/title as well. You guys could break up 2 years from now and you(OP), would be homeless and out on your ass while he gets to stay in HIS house that you helped pay for. \n\nHe\u2019s the only person who is profiting from this situation. If this a relationship, then it should be equal. You\u2019re essentially a tenant with absolutely no legal tenant rights. Stay with your roommates.

I bought a house under my name and took the mortgage and upgrades (solar panels and new windows) while she took everything else and I would be paying more since I made more. I told her, \u201cI can\u2019t afford EVERYTHING to make this happen. I believe it\u2019s fair to pay more since I make more but would like to revisit this if either of us are struggling or doing better off.\u201d \n\nShe responded, \u201cThe house is yours if we split but we\u2019ll both be out if we break up. I feel like I can save up money with this plan in the case that it doesn\u2019t work out.\u201d \n\nWe continued this until we got married and even rearranged the bills due to her promotion. It\u2019s tough to say this, but allowing yourself an out is the most logical thing IMO. It\u2019s tough to talk money but (depending on where you live/PNA) you\u2019ll have 50% of his assets should you two get married. Then would a 50/50 split seem a little more logical", "I agree that it would not be fair that you pay into the equity when you would gain nothing from it in case of a break-up. \n\nEspecially because he will be paying half of what he is currently paying and you have to pay more than you do living with your roommates. \n\nNo one moves in together with the intention of breaking up, but that does mean that it is not going to happen. I think it is very smart to make sure that you do not end up financially suffering while he benefits. \n\nYes the cost might be less than market price for an entire apartment, but the truth also is that you could save up more towards a down payment in you current living situation than you would be able to do if you move in with him and pay 50%. \n\nWhen my mom and stepdad moved in together many many years ago they decided that they did not need an exact split but rather ensuring that it would be what they both considered fair. \nMy stepdad owned the house and it was already payed for so it was agreed that he would pay for everything related to the house - maintenance, utilities etc because it was his house. My mom on the other hand would pay for groceries etc. it also made sense from a practical standpoint because my mom is the one that does the shopping. \n\nEven after they got married they kept that arrangement for some years (pre-nup) and then at one point they decided to merge everything.", "NTA \nMy husband bought his house before we started dating, when I moved in with him we agreed that we would split all bills evenly (utilities and council tax and such) and I would taken on the majority of the shopping bills and he would continue to cover his mortgage. \nEven now that we are married I'm not on the mortgage and I don't contribute to it, we are planning to sell his house in a year or two and buy a bigger family home. I'm saving for my half of the deposit and the profit of the sale of his house will be his contribution. This works well for us and we have a clear division of assets. He never wanted me to feel like he was profiting off me and our relationship,", "NTA - you paying half the utilities and half of the interest in his mortgage seems perfectly fair. I do find it strange that somehow thinking rationally about finances sometimes gets confused with being cheap or petty. \n\nI agree with you 100%. The, relatively small but real, amount you will be saving can go into savings so that you build up your own nest egg.

He still wants to be paid charges parts and labor like the shop but costs a little less.

My full house payment is way less than half of what comparable homes rent for around here ($800 instead of $2100 our nearest neighbor pays) , so he gets full, unrestricted use of 2,300 sq feet and an acre of land for $400. Part of the reason I chose to buy this house was so that he could have a workshop in the basement and a large outbuilding for his projects, in addition to spare bedrooms for his kids and grandchildren when they visit, and a garage that holds two cars and assorted stuff instead of just my car and a lawnmower.  Did we not live together, I wouldn't have a mortgage payment at all because I made just enough from the sale of my other home to outright buy a smaller one more appropriate my needs (I always made the family sleep on couches and air-mattresses on holiday visits.)  We also wouldn't live in such an expensive taxing district if his work didn't have residency requirement, that's for sure!  So I chose a pricier living arrangement to meet my partner's needs, and I'm really glad I did.  Don't get me wrong--I love my home and I LOVE everything about living with Himself in it, but nevertheless, I don't think I should have to shoulder a disproportionately large burden of the cost.  Nor does he.  \n\nYou mention that your current rent with multiple roommates would be less than half of the mortgage, but to make a truly meaningful comparison, you probably need to consider a number of factors.  Total rent of $1200 on a 1300 sq foot apartment with one bathroom shared between four residents SEEMS like a much better deal than half of  $1000 for an identical place until you have to negotiate sharing the public spaces.  How much would it be worth to you to only have one person to argue with over parking spot, bathroom time, kitchen use, space in the refrigerator housekeeping duties, and who gets to have their friends over for dinner and games this Friday?  (I bet a lot less of your food gets stolen with fewer people poking around in the cabinets.)  I also bet your boyfriend would respond better to any request to keep noise down than any roommates I ever had. And as for the argument that the homeowner is profiting somehow from their partner paying half the mortgage, that may not actually be the case.  Have you looked at the breakdown of his monthly payments to see how much is applied to interest, homeowner's insurance, property tax, any condo/HOA/etc fees,  and mortgage insurance and just how little to the principal? I just peeked at the one I paid last week:  Himself's share of the payment applied to the principal was a whopping $52.76.  I'm certainly not going to get rich on that, and I suspect your partner won't either.    Another alternative is he sells his apartment, and you two either rent one together or buy another one with you putting down exactly half of the down payment so that you get an equal share in the property. \n\nI wouldn't say you're an AH for not wanting to pay half his mortgage, perhaps just wrong.  It's ok if you don't want to pay, but that means you don't have to live there if you're not willing to do so. You just don't get to make him look like a greedy scam artist, either, for wanting an equitable split of the costs.", "YTA.\n\nYou shouldn't pay half because he's got equity in the home? Equity you'd be totally fine with any other landlord getting,  but with your partner you're keeping score and don't want him to gain that equity?? Do you think he's using you for equity because I can assure you most men would rather be single and live alone than live with a woman they don't like for equity. He could rent the room out to a stranger with less of a headache and for a profit. \n\nLet me put it this way,  landlords don't just charge exactly what is owed to break even. They rent their properties at a profit. He's not making a profit off renting to you... he's literally offering a 50/50 split, which may be more than you're currently paying with your 3 roommates, but... you are upgrading from 3 roommates to just 1 other person in the home. Obviously, that perk will cost more. \n\nHe gets the equity, but you're failing to comprehend that he has ALL the risk and liability, too. He had to make sacrifices to save up and put down a down payment to get the mortgage at the price it is. You have zero risk and liability. If the dishwasher goes out, it's his responsibility to replace it, not yours. A broken window?? On him.  A pipe breaks and ruins the flooring which has to be replaced??? Also on him. You could literally trash his place and move out and guess who can't just walk away?? Him. This massive risk and liability is on him, but you want get mad that he is building equity? This is why landlords charge rent at a net profit (above the cost of the actual mortgage)... to cover all those unforeseen expenses without subsidizing their tenants lives. You literally could decide you just aren't going to pay rent for the month while he can't. I don't know if you just don't understand the reality of how all this works but I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt that you're simply uneducated and not this selfish and entitled because from what you said in your posts, it seems like you just aren't aware of the big picture. \n\nI hope you really do some soul searching as to why you have this Zero Sum Game mentality, especially with someone you are in a relationship with.", "I think it's weird that you're ok with your money going to build a landlord's equity, but not someone you are supposed to love's equity. Maybe it's a sign you really want out of the relationship rather than in. Frankly, insisting that you'll pay interest but not equity is also silly. It's one payment when it arrives at the bank. The bank doesn't care which part came from you. If you pay \"interest but not principal,\" it just frees up money for your SO to pay principle or to pay for other things. \n\nI honestly don't remember what I did when I moved into my now husband's house before we got married and combined our finances, but now what we pay on our joint expenses is based on our relative incomes, and that feels fair. Your situation is a little different. If your SO is currently living alone, then whatever you pay will help him financially. However, if you pay 50% of his mortgage and utilities, you will be worse off financially than you are now, and that's not fair. Your SO shouldn't want that for you. If your SO is going to kick out a roommate so you can move in, that's different. In that case, you should factor the roommate's rental rate into what you two decide you should pay. Presuming he has no roommate now, you should not pay more into the whole living situation than you are paying currently. (I'm presuming your portion of the utilities will not add up to more than your current portion of the rent + utilities.) I would suggest that because you are not accruing equity and he is, and because you didn't chose what home to buy and he did, a fair decision would be for you to pay the amount that would allow you to both benefit equally financially from the move.

Two points:\n- I do think it is unfortunate that taking your finances seriously and looking out for your situation if the relationship were to end is deemed selfish (you did not use this word, but a lot of others have) or a sign of cold feet. The fact is that a lot of relationships do end, and peoples concern about seeming unsure or cheap for having these conversations is a big cause to why people can end up in very unstable and uneven situations economically if a relationship unfortunately ends after many years.\n- I also wonder if some of the disagreements are due to different cultures and policies. I do not live in a country where you gain equity or are in any way reimbursed for the contribution of your partners loan unless that is agreed. I also live in a country where people often don\u2019t get married until their thirties (if ever!) so ensuring good cohabitation agreements is crucial to ensure a fair outcome if the relationship terminates. The fact that we probably won\u2019t get married for many years does not mean that we are not invested in spending our lives together or share finances (good and bad).

I pay 50% of all property taxes, bills, food, new house purchases like TV and fridge. She wants me to start paying rent..and I'm like no way! What do you think?", "The principal portion of the mortgage is basically him putting money into a non-liquid investment account. That is the portion she's taking issue with because the principal will ultimately not be a 'cost' for him.", "Seriously, all these comments acting like if they broke up he could kick her out overnight clearly don't understand how co-habitation laws work.", "People talk about the law around here all the time like it's super easy to get it enforced. Say he does evict her in the wrong way, what do people think will happen? He'll suddenly have to fix his mistake when she just tells him it's illegal? This shit takes time, effort and money to be enforced. The law isn't magic, civil law especially. Getting something like this enforced takes resources.", "have you met a landlord? lol", "It would be a pretty shitty relationship if the only reason she had a say in how the space she shared with her BF was if she had tenant rights.", "Yeah I wouldn\u2019t want to move in with a partner who wants to profit off me. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d even be in a relationship with someone like that. Life is so uncertain and kindness is so important in a partner. He might be on top now and can provide more, in the future he might not be and would need to rely of her kindness to help him along. If both were working I wouldn\u2019t be happy if I was shouldering all the financial burden but splitting living costs (and insurance) only would be fair to me. I look at it this way, if the person who owns the house would have to pay Z amount if he were to live alone but would have to pay Z+X if the other person moves in then the person moving in would have to pay the X. \n\nI own a property in a good city that I keep as a holiday place. If I were to charge rent for it I can get about \u00a34k a month. I chose to keep it empty so I can go anytime I like and so can other people who wants to. I have to pay taxes on it as well as maintenance fee and some misc bills (internet, cable etc). My sister went to study in said city as she stayed in my place. She pays for the electricity and gas bills and nothing else. Things like internet bill and cable are bills that I would pay regardless of whether or not she\u2019s staying there so I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s fair to ask her to pay for those. I don\u2019t want to profit off my sister. She wouldn\u2019t mind paying and she could very well afford it but it\u2019s not something I\u2019d ever ask her to do. She will repair whatever that\u2019s broken even though I told her to just send me the bill but that\u2019s the way she repays me I guess. \n\nSo yeah if I came across someone like OP\u2019s bf I would not be with him because I think we have completely different values.", "Cohab agreement is basically a prenuptial for a couple who doesn\u2019t yet have plans to be married. Both parties have to be represented by a lawyer and the courts enforce it similar to a pre-nup.", "Depending on the laws for that jurisdiction, but a cohabitation could also be filed with the court, and could have all of those same things.  Mine turned into a Prenup when I got married this year.", "I think what you're talking about is fair (no rent) because it's essentially 50% of the cost to both of you to continue to live there. The question is whether property value goes up where you live (it doesn't in some places, my grandma's house is worth the same today as it was  20 years ago). You might want to make adjustments for that if so. \n\nI generally think the idea should target \"what does it cost us to jointly live here\",  while also calculating in what the owner gains that the non owner doesn't and adjusting correctly for that. \n\nMy monthly housing costs are 3.5x-4x what I charge him in rent and I cover all maintenance. Our split is closer to 75-25   in how much it costs to be here to account for the fact that he isn't getting equity and I am.", ">She wants me to start paying rent..and I'm like no way! \n\nWhy not?  If the house was paid off, the other person still has maintenance, taxes, and many other expenses that will come up.  Also, this was THEIR investment risk that they put in.  Why should you get the benefit of paying less on the backs of their money and investment practices?\n\nI moved in, and started paying rent.  I paid her the exact same as I was paying at the last place I lived at.", "Whether it\u2019s filed or not isn\u2019t what makes it binding. It\u2019s a contract so as long as both parties have fair legal representation and the contract is notarized it\u2019s legally binding. \n\nThe cohab agreement can even stipulate that mediation or alternate dispute resolution be used before filing other legal motions.", "Exactly.  And when you are getting the cohabitation drafted, you likely still like each other and it's a good relationship, so you can make decisions and judgements on a good mindset.  If you wait until you break up, then shit hits the fan because both of you are likely bitter and don't want to give an inch.\n\nMy cohab even had sections that protected me more than the landlord tenant act would, so that was nice.", "She'd be paying more with 1/2 the roomates. It's not difficult to imagine that an apartment with 4 people living in it would be cheaper per person than 2."]}
