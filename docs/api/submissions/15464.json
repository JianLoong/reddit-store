I'm sure the reason they continue to make it IN SPITE OF my complete dislike is that other people, presumably also possessed of both taste buds and wallets, actually like it.

Wtf. What baffles me is how little effort it would've taken to accommodate her. Seasonings are often the last ingredient added.

When I make food to bring, I always include something for them, whether it's vegan cookies, vegetable soup in place of chicken gnocchi, or orange glazed tofu instead of ham/chicken. Does it take extra effort to make these dishes? Absolutely. But I enjoy cooking and knowing that they feel included and cared for.
