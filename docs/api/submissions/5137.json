{"id": 5137, "submission_id": "zppj2a", "title": "AITA for telling my nail tech I will no longer go to her appointment after she managed to squizz me in?", "selftext": "It's been 6 years since I (27f) have been friends with Liz(38f), 4 years ago Liz got her nail technician diploma, and she ended up opening an at-home nail salon in a spare room of her apartment and would schedule clients based on her spare time, which was not a problem for me as I have a pretty flexible work schedule.\n\nSometimes she would change the time and date of my appointment and call me right before the scheduled time to let me know, or just cancel and forget to tell me, making me wait outside her closed shop. Regardless of why my appointment was canceled, I never argued with her. After she had her baby, a boy, now 2 years old, and had to cancel because she had to take care of him, I wouldn't get mad or argue with her. My nails can wait, the child comes first.\n\nI set up a date for December at my last appointment (today, the 19th). She already had another client waiting, so she told me to send a text with the scheduled time and date so she can write it down at the end of the day. That is exactly what I did, in the hallway of her salon before I left. I even told her I did, and she confirmed it.\n\nFast forward to today, at 10 AM I texted Liz asking if we were still on with my appointment. She called me back and informed me that I did not have an appointment today or any other day and that she had a doctor's appointment at that time. She's fully booked and can't take me until the 28th of December. I kindly remind her of our discussion from last month and add that the 28th won't work for me as I am not in the country then. She started getting a bit irritated on the phone. Her child was screaming in the back. As she seemed to be busy, I told her we would schedule another appointment. A few minutes after the call ended, Liz texted me saying I am an asshole and I always do this s\\*it to her. She also said that I am always rude to her when she has to cancel and threatened her with disrespect.\n\nShe told me not to contact her and to find a new nail tech. The text shocked me. I tried to speak to her but she began cursing at me, so I blocked her on Facebook. About 2 hours ago she called me saying she managed to squizz me in but I shouldn't have made a fuss and been a b\\*itch about it. I said I was not interested as she said she didn't want me as her client anymore. So...
