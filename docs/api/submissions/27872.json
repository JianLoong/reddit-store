She was pretending to be asleep. I was literally humiliated and upon confronting her, she said she was bored, asked why I'd invited her and said \"Your wedding had better not be this dull or I'll fall asleep there too\".\n\nI was absolutely furious, but as calmly as I could muster walked away, ordered a cab without telling her, then went back and told her she could go.

Take away the word Mom from this post for a second and imagine your friend telling you this story. Put the word friend in place of Mom. A friend of your friends was snoring and interrupting at their bachelorette party. Think about it for a second and the story changes. Then, replace the word friend with the word sibling and think about how it once again changes the story.\n\nIf someone else told you this about their friend or sibling, you'd say that the person had been continuously and repeatedly displaying a pattern of behavior that was cruel and disrespectful. That your friend had already and repeatedly communicated to that person about how cruel they were. That, by now, the friend or sibling was clearly and consciously choosing to be cruel. \n\nLet's make it go back to your mother and her doing this behavior. I'm sorry if it sounds mean.\n\nYou're being hurt because you're expecting your mother to act like a normal mother. You deserve a normal mother, but history shows that she's abnormal. So, you can't expect normal behavior. Your mother will never act like you want because she has never acted that way. You're being hurt because your expectations are different from reality. \n\nI'm sorry if it sounds harsh, but the evidence shows that your mother doesn't care and has never cared. Repeating the same thing over and over and expecting a different outcome is madness.  You have to treat her how she's showed you have to treat her and readjust your expectations to match reality, or this will only repeat and you will only be unhappy.\n\nAgain, you deserve a normal mother. But, reality says otherwise and I'm sorry.\n\nYou have a few choices. \n\nThe bachelorette has shown how your mother behaves and views your event. That it was so boring that she had to fake snoring to get attention on herself to make a show of it. If you invite your mother to the wedding, her past behavior supports your mother making a scene no matter what you say or want. \n\nIf you want a normal wedding with your mother in attendance, you have to make her behave because she won't behave by herself. She'd be like an angry toddler that needs to be monitored and actively kept from misbehaving because they don't know how to regulate their emotions. Unfortunately, your mother is old enough to regulate herself and chooses to misbehave. \n\nIf you want a normal wedding without extra stress or possible disappointment, you'd uninvite her and deal with the fallout because the benefit of uninviting her outweighs the benefit of inviting her.", "NTA at all!\n\nIf she\u2019s going to do this at your bachelorette party, what\u2019s she going to do at your wedding?\n\nYou\u2019re putting far more effort into maintaining a relationship with your mum than she is.", "JAW ON FLOOR!", "NTA\n\nYour mother told you how she was going to behave on your wedding day.
