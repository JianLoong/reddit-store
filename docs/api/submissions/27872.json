As a kind gesture I invited my mom, knowing it wasn't going to be anything too crazy and out of a desire to be closer to her.\n\nMy mom made weird, side swipey comments all night about myself and my friends and got super defensive when I asked her to stop.

She was pretending to be asleep.

They are responsible for elbowing her awake, keeping her away from you and from any microphones, for being beside her to steer any unpleasant conversation, for keeping her from speaking up during the ceremony and ultimately for escorting her out if needed and driving her elsewhere.  Bodygaurd for that last one wouldn't be the worst if you don't have someone strong that your mom won't shout at.\n\nBut not having there at all sounds warranted based on how she behaved so far honestly.  Does she really resent you that much or what?\n\nHas she been showing any signs of dementia or is this normal behavior for her?", "Nta. \n\nUninvite her. If you're at a venue with staff let them know she is not allowed. Let your wedding party know she is not allowed. Grooms side too.", "Good god. Uninviting her was the only rational action. Please don\u2019t blame yourself for this but maybe you need to stop trying to have a relationship with your mum. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry your mother isn\u2019t loving and supportive. Her behavior was childish, rude, and cruel. It sounds like you\u2019ve been the adult in your relationship for many years. It has to be exhausting and depressing.", "> Was I wrong to uninvite her?  \n  \nNo. She will ruin your wedding like everything else apparently. Take the lesson that a life time with her has taught you and stick to your guns. NTA", "NTA. Don\u2019t hire bodyguards. Let your husband\u2019s crew take over. I assure you a lot of his friends will be happy to remove her!!! A bridesmaid or MOH may be happy to spill red wine (or any staining beverage) on her as well. Dang I hate when those bridesmaids slip wirh a drink.", "she sounds like a real treat.  she sounds determined to make things about her miserable ass either way, so i say go for it.  get a couple guys to watch the door and enjoy your wedding, her drama can wait lol it's not going anywhere.

AND UNINVITE HER? Wow. Shame", "NTA Your mom sounds like an attention seeking kinda person, if you didn\u2019t rescind the invite I\u2019m sure she\u2019d find a way to make drama and everything about her.  Either have security at the event or let members of the family/ushers etc know to reject her if she attempts to crash.", "NTA\n\nYour \"kind gesture\" blew up in your face.\n\nBeing kind to horrific people is a waste of time.\n\nHire the bodyguard and have her removed if she shows up.", "NTA\n\nYour mother is clearly not going to grow up. Just kick her to the curb.", "NTA.  If you have to consider bodyguards you know the answer to how toxic she is.  Has anyone ever had to get bodyguards to keep you away?  Has anyone even thought of it?  If she\u2019s so far gone that that\u2019s a reasonable thought then you do need to protect yourself from her, sadly.", "Shoulda just thrown a blanket over here and ignored her, but NTA for uninviting her.", "NTA\n\nOP. You did the right thing. Your mum was clearly over exhausted and getting her a cab home was the appropriate thing to do. :)\n\nIf she is going to make comments like that then its best you not invite her in fear of her short attention span being a limiting factor to her enjoyment of your special day. No negative vibezzz at weddings please.\n\nInform the venue and possibly hire some security in case she turns up.", "No. You weren't wrong. I grew up in a similar situation and tried to build a similar bridge. Unfortunately, some people are just narcissistic and can't be helped or changed. If she makes your life stressful, it's okay to distance yourself for your own well being.", "NTA \n\nEnjoy the day you celebrate the start of your own family. It sounds like that will be much easier without your mom in attendance.", "We had similar situation in a wedding. We hired a security company to guard the front door and side doors. We also gave the picture of the people we thought may cause trouble. Everything went smoothly. Good luck.", "NTA she sounds like a total nightmare. You don\u2019t want an attention seeking narcissist ruining your wedding day.", "NTA - your mom sounds absolutely awful.\n\n>I've literally considered hiring bodyguards for my own wedding.\n\nDo it. And let her know.\n\n>but a part of me can't stop loving her and I guess holding on to a fantasy that she could become better\n\nThat's what therapists are for, to help you let go of this. Because you're making decisions impacting your real life based on a dream.", "NTA. Generally, I think people are way too quick to weaponize wedding invitations. I also think people are way too quick to conflate a lapse into  narcissistic behavior with narcissism as a personality disorder.\n\nBut hoo boy!\n\nYou invited her to an event. She chose to come. Rather than discreetly saying \u201cI\u2019m feeling a bit out of place here,so I\u2019m going to go; you have fun with your friends, love you\u201d she tried to make the event all about her and disrupted it. Your fear that she might do the same at your wedding is well-founded. Her inability to behave appropriately combined with her severe attention seeking behavior passes even my strict test. \n\nPlease have an amazing, drama free wedding.", "Get security and give them her picture.

Don't let her.", "NTA. She sounds horrible.", "NTA.  The wedding is supposed to be attended by people who love you and support the marriage.  Let her stay home.  I am sorry she is so horrible.", "NTA not even going to explain, it\u2019s obvious.

I wouldn't put it passed OP's mother to escalate things to a severly problematic level, and it is much better to let professionals handle the problem.
