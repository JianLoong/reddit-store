When I asked if we needed to secure accommodations, I was told that they rented a house from Friday through Monday and that they had plenty of room for us as there were 3 bedrooms with double beds and one with bunks. \nI haven\u2019t had a good relationship with my two sisters for several years now but I\u2019ve been trying to re-establish some kind of connection.\nI was told that my oldest sister was bringing her husband but my younger sister\u2019s husband wouldn\u2019t be attending and that she would be bringing her son\u2019s girlfriend. Because of this, my younger sister had \u201cclaimed the room with the bunk beds\u201d.  That was perfect because that meant that my husband and I would have a room with a double bed. \nFirst off, we were told at the very last minute that we would be checking in on Saturday (not Friday as we were originally told). We had both already taken off work Friday through Monday so we decided that rather than leaving on Thursday night, we would leave on Friday (driving from Illinois) take our time and spend the night somewhere on the way. When we arrived at the rental on Saturday, nobody was there yet.  We tried calling my mom\u2019s cell phone but got no answer. We decided to go get something to eat at a nearby restaurant while we waited to hear from the rest of the party. \nWhen my mom finally called us it was to tell us that they had arrived at the house and that my younger sister\u2019s husband was able to come after all and that she had decided that they would be taking the room with the double bed and my husband and I would get the room with the bunks since we were the last to arrive. That was also when we were told that everyone was staying until Tuesday. We had to leave on Monday because of our work schedules. \nIt turns out that my parents changed the reservation to accommodate my younger sister\u2019s husband\u2019s work schedule but we were made to believe that we had just misunderstood from the beginning.  \nWhen we returned home several extended family members called and texted me asking why my husband and I left early.

It's hard to say from this post whether you were set up, but you were certainly treated badly here.  How freaking hard was it for someone in your family to let you know the change of plans?  And that bit about you being the last to arrive so you get stuck with the bunkbeds is an AH move on their part for sure, as is the gaslighting.  Mom admits they changed the schedule, but you \"misunderstood\" what you were told?  Spare me.  Frankly your family sounds kind of toxic and you might want to rethink contact level and future involvement in these little get togethers, but that's just MHO.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
