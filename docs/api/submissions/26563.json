I will not go to church, and my parents would never even think of asking me. My grandparents on the other hand, particularly my grandma just would not understand. \n\nYou\u2019re just coming from totally different places. She wants you to go because it\u2019s important to her and church is a big part of her life. You have perfectly valid reasons not to want to go to church and she\u2019s asking you to go to a place that just makes you think of the loss of your dad. \n\nI would probably just say \u201cListen Mom, I know you want me to go to church with you, but I just can\u2019t. The whole time I\u2019m going to be thinking about Dad\u2019s funeral, and I want to be able to take part in a happy celebration of your birthday.

You clearly aren\u2019t a church goer and you are allowed to have boundaries in place when it comes to religion and religious places. You set the boundary and offer to spend time with your mom for her birthday in different ways.", "Church is a tough one for me too. My mom is always threatening to take my kids when she and my dad have them over. Before I had kids when I had more time, I\u2019d go with them at Christmas and Easter because it made them happy. I could make it through an hour and a half or whatever even though I\u2019m an atheist now. Now that I have two small kids, it doesn\u2019t happen. I just hate the guilt parents use when one church service isn\u2019t going to bring us back. NTA, but it won\u2019t kill you if you want to make your mom happy. Ugh stupid church.", "NTA. But if you feel guilty and want to please Mom, you can always go and just daydream. If I\u2019m bored in church, I usually tune out the pastor and daydream.

The *one thing* she wants from you is something that she knows will make you miserable. Doesn't matter that it's church, she could want you to take her shopping, but if you hate shopping it's a cruel thing to ask.\n\nWhat she wants most for her birthday is to make you miserable to make herself feel like she's doing the \"right\" thing, so she feels better about whatever religious guilt she carries. Give her the gifts on Saturday and tell her to enjoy her birthday.", "NTA.\n\nShe's trying to manipulate you, don't fall for it.  You've set a boundary on not going, that's it.", "NTA. I'm an atheist and it's part of my core self. My mother is a churchgoer. I don't compromise on this. It's an integrity thing for me. If it is for you as well, you need to stand your ground. Your mother needs to know you love her, but that you still aren't doing this.\n\nBut you may not be this tough-minded about it. You may just not want to go, but it might actually be good for you to do a thing you don't want, simply for the sake of somebody else---and find out it won't kill you to do it. One of those maturity things.\n\nOnly you can know how strongly you feel. Whether it's core or not. And if it isn't...\n\nHere's a test: think about going. Do you think you will like yourself more afterwards if you go and make this accommodation, or do you think you will dislike yourself more for allowing yourself to be pushed into it to settle mom down? And remember, there will be other birthdays?\n\nThere's no wrong answer.\n\nKnowing yourself and your boundaries is a good thing, and it's a lifelong process.", "NTA, but it sounds like she\u2019d appreciate your presence more than the presents you bought.", "NTA - Guilt is not a reason to do something for someone, which is a little ironic considering the topic. It's okay to say Mom, I want to make you happy, but I won't be going on Sunday.", "It's called a present.  It is what YOU GIVE someone, something that you want them to have.  You \"present\" it to them.  \n\nimo She is being selfish and using \"birthday\" to manipulate you.  You do not OWE her a trip to church.  If you want to please her, go ahead.  If you truly dislike it that much, tell her it is not about your love for her but your dislike for church.\n\nShe probably won't understand, but birthdays are for \"presents,\" not leveraging loved ones.", "NAH - it's okay for her to ask, as long as she accepts the no, but if it's a matter of principle for you, so stay true to yourself.  If it's only the trauma aspect, consider trying to power through it; your future self may be grateful you did.", "YTA. Just tell that your comfort means more to you than her happiness. I really don't think she'll want to celebrate with you anymore.", "You won\u2019t be reliving the funeral, that\u2019s a very different service, and if it makes your mom happy, why not?", "Ever go to a movie you wouldn't choose, but your friends want to see it?  How about watching a ballgame for a team you're not that interested in?  Isn't life full of \"events\" that we might not enjoy completely ourselves, but we go because someone we care about wants to?\n\nYTA.  It's a couple of hours.", "I\u2019m leaning towards YTA, but only sort of.\n\nI definitely understand church hurt and trauma, especially when going back to the place where you had your fathers funeral. It can be painful. And your boundaries matter. And if she loves you and respects you, she won\u2019t force you to.\n\nBut also.\n\nIt\u2019s your mothers birthday, it\u2019s about what she wants and not what you want. You said you want to make her happy, and she\u2019s mentioned to you what she\u2019d like and you\u2019re making it about yourself. Imagine the smile she\u2019ll have on her face, to be able to do something she likes with someone she loves. You can give that to her on her birthday.\n\nThis is tough, friend, not gonna lie.", "NAH\n\nBut I wouldn't explain it as you did here. Just tell her that the church reminds you of the loss of your father.", "Unless you had a traumatic experience in church  beyond your father\u2019s funeral, YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s your mom. Don\u2019t make it about you.", "....I would never agree to do something someone is trying to manipulate, emotionally blackmail or coerce me into doing. You shouldn't either because it will never end and you know it. From what you've said this is no benign little church full of honest faithful people, I be jumping out of my skin in a place like that!\n\nI am sorry for the recent loss of your Dad and offer my condolences,  I still remember & grieve my own father's loss to this day. It has been a long time but I don't think I will ever get over it, so don't let anyone tell you what/how/how long you should feel that loss for. Tell her you just can't get past the bad memories there, it's too difficult and hope she understands.\n\nNTA OP she will have to accept a compromise.", "NTA\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t be forced to go to church just cause it\u2019s your moms bday", "That would be a total dealbreaker for me. If they took my kids anywhere against my explicit objections, they would become LC or NC grandparants.", "Or read the super spicy parts of the Bible. Song of Solomon has some great R rated stuff.\n\nI personally tend to look at the artwork when boredom strikes (this depends on the church of course). When in Europe, I've found going to mass on Sunday is much better than paying to take a guided tour because you have an hour plus to check the church out.", "Thank you for explaining that so well, great points. There's also some nuance involved here as it's not simply a matter of \"I don't want to go\". I think for some other commenters here it's hard to grasp the full picture. Just picturing the last time I was at this church triggers my anxiety & brings me close to tears. I couldn't walk in that place & hold it together when it was once full of flowers & family photos, with my Dad's casket front & center. I want my Mom's Birthday to be special but I know if I go I'd probably have to skip out on the rest of the day to calm down. I tend to shut down completely on days when I'm reminded of my Dad, despite my best efforts to keep my composure.", "Blows my mind that someone can be just as religious about atheism as a christian is about christianity. The point was to unshackle yourself from the calvinist zeal bro, not change religions", "If someone tells a religious Christian they want company  to visit a Satan worshiping club, would you still have the same answer?", "Attending a movie or sports game are not as personal as faith, or lack of faith. \n\nI wasn\u2019t forced to attend a movie I didn\u2019t like for a hour every week of my childhood, but I was forced to attend a church. If you ask me to attend a service you know I fundamentally disagree with for your \u201cbirthday\u201d that\u2019s not a gift, that\u2019s a manipulation.", "From a comment from the OP ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16emgvn/comment/jzw9kt2/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), this is a Christian Reich hate church, not anything I'd recognise as religion.", "I mean my Dad's funeral was probably the most traumatic point in my life so far, aside from being in the room when he died. \nMy mom is pretty brainwashed by conspiracy theories & turned his funeral into a far right political statement by requesting that the sermon revolve around how evil the world is instead of anything comforting. If it was any other church I'd go without hesitation.", "Your mom needs to hear exactly what you just said. I\u2019m betting she has no idea that this is what the church service would actually do to you.", "I'm so sorry for your loss, and I can see you are in a sticky situation here. NTA - and I agree with not going. There was one thing that stood out to me though, and I wondered if she so wants you to accompany her to church to feel close to your dad? It is the first birthday of hers without him. Perhaps there is something you could do together to feel close without you going to church, for example, did he make her pancakes on her birthday, and you could do that? I hope this comes across with the kindness intended.", "Christian Reich hate church? Sorry, I\u2019m out of the loop. Unsure what that is, but given Reich and hate are in the name, it ain\u2019t sounding Godly.\n\nI did read a comment from OP that his mother made his fathers funeral a political thing, she\u2019s a conspiracy theorist or something like that, and that definitely changed my perspective.", "That's a very sound reason. That wasn't church, it was the Nuremburg rally. Don't do hatefests.", "I agree. This is going to be too hard for you, and considering it's supposed to be about your mother's special day, not grieving your dad, feeling as you know you do will not contribute anything to your mother's birthday just to satisfy her desire for family at church. You aren't ready to go into that building in any case and you can't hurry that up. Maybe you'll go in someday; not now. So perhaps celebrate with her without church, and make it all about her, giving her your full attention. She really needs to know your heart on this.\n\nMy best to you. I know you'll do what's right for you at this time, because you are quite thoughtful and fully connected to yourself.", "Christian right, then."]}
