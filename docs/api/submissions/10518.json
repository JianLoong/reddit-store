We have a history of doing like 1 night trips where we go and chill and check out fun restaurants and stuff in nearby cities- check out the local food scene, have drinks, catch up. My bday is coming up, and as I have PTO and he doesn\u2019t, I told him I\u2019d take a PTO and it\u2019d be chill if we could keep our tradition alive, that was my bday ask. A nice little night out for the both of us. He said yeah, sounds great and I was excited.\n\nOut of the blue, he tells me today that he invited his wife, his best friend (who I\u2019ve met like twice) and and his best friends partner who I don\u2019t know. He Didn\u2019t ask, he told me, and said we\u2019d be staying at his mother in laws and said \u201cisn\u2019t that exciting now we don\u2019t have to pay for a hotel\u201d. \n\nI get that he thinks it\u2019s nice? The more the merrier from his point of view, and he was like \u201coh they\u2019re there to celebrate you\u201d but I don\u2019t really know his other best friend, though he\u2019s sweet, and I don\u2019t know his best friends partner. I wanted to celebrate my bday with my bud and keep our friends trip thing goin, and I\u2019m super uncomfortable with celebrating my bday with people I don\u2019t really know under the pretense of \u201cmy birthday\u201d especially because it feels like 1) I wasn\u2019t asked, this feels like it\u2019s more him co-opting the trip for his own fun and 2) I\u2019m super uncomfortable being the 5th wheel especially because they\u2019re\u2026party people who like to partake of things that make the vibe more touchy feely party-like and I\u2019m a be sitting there alone while they end up making out. \n\nSo I told him I am not into him inviting 3 other people without asking me, I\u2019m not into being a 5th wheel, and I\u2019m not into turning the middle of the week into a rave so have fun without me. I took the next day off but im not looking to go crazy crazy in the middle of a work week.

He invited people that you don\u2019t know!! \n\nTake your PTO and do something you want to do. No reason to be miserable and a fifth wheel.", "NTA - this isn't the trip you planned, your buddy should have discussed changing plans with you, first.", "NTA. It's your birthday and he invited people you don't know to \"celebrate you.\" It's kind of obvious he's doing this for himself, not for you.", "NTA,\n\nSounds like your buddy isn't too concerned about your happiness.", "NTA \u2014 this is YOUR birthday trip, not his. It\u2019s really that simple. Happy birthday.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry he did this but it was clear he didn\u2019t have much of a sense of what you wanted and I think you\u2019re entitled to design your own birthday trip. Hope you all work it out.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s rude to commandeer a trip like that without first discussing it with you. Sounds like they wanted their own party and you came second. Ouch. \n\nBig hugs and happy birthday. I hope you decide to do something fun and not let their thoughtlessness take the day from you. Life too short to give it away to the undeserving.", "NTA, this is a pretty one-sided gripe post. You haven't made much of a case for why you could be TA. Hopefully, your friend reflects on his choices and does better in the future.", "NAH. Did he reply to you why he invited them or did you not give him an opportunity.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nWhat a massive dick move on his part.  He wanted to do something different with his budget than your usual trip? He wanted to party with his wife, buddy, and the buddy's wife? Okay, fine. But if he didn't want to go on the trip with you as it was planned, he owed you the common courtesy of just saying so and cancelling. He didn't have the right to change your birthday trip into a completely different event. Claiming that these people who are basically strangers* to you would be there to celebrate your birthday is disingenuous nonsense.\n\n\n*Yes, I get that you met his buddy 2x. But do you KNOW him? Is he one of YOUR friends? Do you two have any connection of your own? Would you ever have thought to hang out with him without your mutual friend? No, he's just an acquaintance at most and no reasonable person would be okay with this.", "NTA. it\u2019s your birthday so it\u2019s definitely odd for your friend to invite three other people without consulting you. Even stranger is the fact that you barely know these people, and now will have to stay with them at your friends mother in laws place. It seems like they wanted to do a couples trip and your friend still wanted to hangout with you. Very disrespectful, your friend is the AH", "You're not the a hole.", "NTA. He's not a very good friend.", "NTA\n\nYou should ask him why he decided to do all of that without asking you. Did he know that you wouldn\u2019t want more people invited and did it without asking because he assumed you wouldn\u2019t protest if he already did it, or is he just oblivious? Sorry he did this AH move on your birthday.", "NTA leaning towards NAH. \n\nYou were the one who asked him to go for *your* birthday. I mean, I get that it\u2019s nice they all want to celebrate your birthday, but I\u2019ve been you in situations where I ended up crying in my bed the whole weekend. \n\nHe seems like he genuinely wanted to save you the hotel fare, which is a thing in itself. Inviting other people along you don\u2019t know for your birthday is another. Maybe thank him again for the house offer. I don\u2019t think he wanted to upset you, he just didn\u2019t think about how that might affect you/the way you wanted to celebrate.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I do know his wife of course, he\u2019s a good bud, and she\u2019s great- it\u2019s just the whole \u201cthis is turning into a couples trip instead of a buds bday trip\u201d without asking that gets me", "Oh thanks! Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got a big party planned with all my friends who\u2019s schedules are like my own.

He should\u2019ve asked.", "NTA he totally hijacked your birthday trip, changing the place to stay from a hotel to his relative's home and inviting his own relatives and friends to come along It is your birthday trip, you invited your friend. If there were to be more people invited they would be your family and friends, not his. You would be doing the activities you wanted, not his. Then there is is justification afterwards. He doesnt care about how you feel or think about it - he actually tells you what to think and feel. 'You should be happy that...' like you should somehow be grateful to him. He is dismissive and by telling you that you ought to be grateful that you are getting to come along to what he has organised, shows he has very little respect or regard for you. He has stopped thinking about you and is only thinking about himself. I think this friendship is over as far as being one of any true depth.", "NTA You know you'd get stuck sleeping on some random couch or similar while the couples take the spare bedrooms.", "NTA. He changed literally everything about the trip.", "It\u2019s time to cut him off. He\u2019s not a friend if he makes you feel like that. He\u2019s definitely not worth it.
