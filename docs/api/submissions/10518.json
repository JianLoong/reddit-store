It\u2019s really that simple. Happy birthday.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry he did this but it was clear he didn\u2019t have much of a sense of what you wanted and I think you\u2019re entitled to design your own birthday trip.

Life too short to give it away to the undeserving.", "NTA, this is a pretty one-sided gripe post. You haven't made much of a case for why you could be TA. Hopefully, your friend reflects on his choices and does better in the future.", "NAH. Did he reply to you why he invited them or did you not give him an opportunity.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nWhat a massive dick move on his part.  He wanted to do something different with his budget than your usual trip? He wanted to party with his wife, buddy, and the buddy's wife? Okay, fine. But if he didn't want to go on the trip with you as it was planned, he owed you the common courtesy of just saying so and cancelling. He didn't have the right to change your birthday trip into a completely different event. Claiming that these people who are basically strangers* to you would be there to celebrate your birthday is disingenuous nonsense.\n\n\n*Yes, I get that you met his buddy 2x. But do you KNOW him? Is he one of YOUR friends? Do you two have any connection of your own? Would you ever have thought to hang out with him without your mutual friend? No, he's just an acquaintance at most and no reasonable person would be okay with this.", "NTA. it\u2019s your birthday so it\u2019s definitely odd for your friend to invite three other people without consulting you. Even stranger is the fact that you barely know these people, and now will have to stay with them at your friends mother in laws place. It seems like they wanted to do a couples trip and your friend still wanted to hangout with you. Very disrespectful, your friend is the AH", "You're not the a hole.", "NTA. He's not a very good friend.", "NTA\n\nYou should ask him why he decided to do all of that without asking you. Did he know that you wouldn\u2019t want more people invited and did it without asking because he assumed you wouldn\u2019t protest if he already did it, or is he just oblivious? Sorry he did this AH move on your birthday.", "NTA leaning towards NAH. \n\nYou were the one who asked him to go for *your* birthday. I mean, I get that it\u2019s nice they all want to celebrate your birthday, but I\u2019ve been you in situations where I ended up crying in my bed the whole weekend. \n\nHe seems like he genuinely wanted to save you the hotel fare, which is a thing in itself. Inviting other people along you don\u2019t know for your birthday is another. Maybe thank him again for the house offer. I don\u2019t think he wanted to upset you, he just didn\u2019t think about how that might affect you/the way you wanted to celebrate.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He doesnt care about how you feel or think about it - he actually tells you what to think and feel. 'You should be happy that...' like you should somehow be grateful to him. He is dismissive and by telling you that you ought to be grateful that you are getting to come along to what he has organised, shows he has very little respect or regard for you.
