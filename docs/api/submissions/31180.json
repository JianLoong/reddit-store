What pointless, over controlling nonsense...", "Gift giving used to be something of an art form. The giver thoughtfully selected something that warmed the giftee and signified their personal relationship. But, that was the expectation 100 years ago, I guess? It was more about demonstrating our regard for people than anything. \n\nAnd I can agree with others that conventionalities do seem trivial or outmoded at times. \n\nHowever, the idea of someone ordering a gift from my hands to be given to their child is just not my thing. Your sister can shop online for anything she wants her children to have, rather than order shipment from you.

We let our kids make lists, just so each sibling would have an idea what that kids likes to do, wear, their taste in games, books, etc. Not as a purchasing list! The kids knew not to expect to het everything on their list and maybe not anything exactly as specified. As the kids got older, lists got shorter as they would show the ONE thing they really wanted.

Also, I have personally *hated* getting gifts since I was probably 12/13 and always told family I prefer gift cards or cash because I can buy what I like when I feel like it. I feel Christmas gifts - traditional ones - are more for little kids because they just love to tear into the paper and go crazy seeing what surprise lies in store. Also for the parents just see the joy on their kids' faces when they tear into the paper, but the point of a gift in general is meant to be something given from the heart.
