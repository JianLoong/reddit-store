Standing firm on either 25th or 28-31th, but not both is extremely reasonable imo. Spending my basically ALL OF MY VACATION days at my Inlaws vs relaxing at home? This is a no-brainer.

She's not saying that he can't visit. As far as we know, he could visit his family any time he wants. Just that she doesn't want to coordinate two trips right around the holidays.

There's zero indication of that here.", "No problem for me that he would go alone, I encourage him to visit his parents more often alone when his schedule permits it, though he rarely does.

This is something I feel very strongly about.", "The original idea was to go for the whole day on the 25th. My husband suggested that we do that, plus the 28th-31st (a three day visit).

All of this time is spent with his family (we don't do any other activities in their town).", "I don't mind spending time with his family, I am not particularly close to them but on good terms, I would say its an average in-law relationship. I just don't like to drive there and back twice in a week, especially since the original plan was to relax at home during 28-31 Dec, and I was looking forward to spending some days in block at home, maybe visiting my parents some more or organizing a date with my husband which we rarely have time to do otherwise due to his work schedule.

It\u2019s 3 hours in the car with a 2 year old.", "It honestly surprised me to learn that sort of thing was real and not just a TV thing, because growing up, my family had it pretty easy - my mom\u2019s family was almost always Christmas Eve (once it got scheduled a different day for easier travel, but nobody was very happy), my dad\u2019s family got Christmas Day, and there was just never any drama over it.  My husband and I are from opposite sides of the country, so we can\u2019t just split like that.  We did alternating years, but my disability got worse and his parents don\u2019t have a decent bed in the guest room, so we haven\u2019t gone in a while.", "I don't just mean that but seeing your family twice a week every week and travelling 1.5 hours once a month every month to his.

I'm just thinking about how I would feel if my family were the ones further away. It would probably be really hard to see my partner's family so often and not feel like I could see my family on Christmas, with my family. The alternative is not being able to see my family for a few days. I definitely think the husband should offer more help if they do both. I think it might be reasonable to ask to bring their toddler with him on Christmas if she doesn't want to make the two trips. That's why I didn't put YTA because I think it's too complicated to be one sided. I do see your point though", "Perfect!  Now you just have to get everyone else on board and have yourself a cocktail!", "Because in one of her responses, OP flat out said if they stayed home, she'd want to spend some of that time with her family.", "Why can\u2019t they ever come to you?

It\u2019s not very hard to comprehend that. Why not be a good partner and go along with it for the sake of his happiness? You get to see your parents basically whenever you want, and now you\u2019re making it impossible for him to spend more time with them during the holidays. \n\nMaybe you can make him do the driving or why not ask if the in-laws can come to you?", "My in-laws are in another country and in Central Europe there is a sort of two Christmas so we do \u201cfirst Christmas\u201d with them, my parents view is we are our own separate unit, and they live the other end of the country (7+ hours drive away) so we spend Christmas in our home but my in-laws always invite us over for Christmas so \u201cwe arnt alone\u201d.

As a family, we usually visit once a month (going there purpusefully only for the visit, all three of us, eating together etc).", "By this logic I should not go visit my family that lives 10 hours drive in 1 direction. But for some reason my husband is ok with it./s \n\nThis is holiday time when we should be generous not just with gifts but also with understanding and supporting with our love ones.\n\nMy husbands'job is almost 1 hour away from our home but I guess because he needs to spend every day 2 hours in car he should just quit./s\n\nI think OP is just trying to find excuse, I bet if situation is reverse and she asked from husband to travel to her family, and he said no, she would get full support on this reddit and her husband behavior would be called controlling.", "That's not the same though. She's gonna spend time with them because they're close and she has time off. That's much different than doing whatever at the drop of a hat to travel hours to visit. False equivalence.", "I suggested inviting the in-laws on 25th, but they don't want to come. Otherwise they visit sometimes (last time they visited was Dec 5th).", "Or, if the drive is really the issue, she and the daughter could spend 26-27 with in laws while husband returns home and spends those two days working.  Then he can drive back to his parents house on the morning of the 28th.  Thus the dreaded 90 minute car ride would be avoided by OP.", "So, you think she should be forced to coordinate and go on a trip that she doesn't want to go on? Why is it that she's supposed to be generous and understanding that he wants to see his family but he can't be generous and understanding that she doesn't want to do all that work? \n\nI think you're just trying to find an excuse to paint this situation or the responses as misandrist. I bet if this situation was reversed, you'd be calling the woman entitled and demanding and manipulative because she wants to visit her family twice. \n\nAlso, your husband should quit if he can. That's a terrible commute. Yikes.", "> My husbands'job is almost 1 hour away from our home but I guess because he needs to spend every day 2 hours in car he should just quit./s\n> \n> \n\nIt's weird you've listed this as ridiculous like commute time isn't an important part of job hunting.", "Uhhh yes actually, your husband should probably do everything in his power to find a job that is closer to home\u2026 sitting in a car for 2 hours every day is an awful way to spend time", "Okay spending extra time uncomfortable in someone else\u2019s house isn\u2019t a compromise.", "True, I feel like there are so many potential compromises. Communicate to partner that she doesn\u2019t like doing the majority of care when there at the in laws house.", "Or, y'know, since the husband wants to go maybe he could come up with all these compromises?", "NTA It is far too much travelling for a little one.

My husband and I compromise, I sometimes I go by myself and he stays with his family over the holidays. honestly I like his family but I get tired of their faces and most times I play with my sister in laws puppies, she\u2019s a puppy breeder. I wonder if your husband is just missing his family and he feels like y\u2019all do everything with your family. You can maybe ask if family is willing to come to you on one of those days.

And then mom would get some time to herself. \n\nI do think that it's a bit of a drive to do in 1 day just to do it again 2 days later. It's an unnecessary use of gas. And too quick of a turnaround for a 3 year old. \n\nI think parents should be where they want to be with their kids for holidays, but it's not always that significant to be around non immediate family. One of my friends and her extended family had Christmas at Thanksgiving because everyone was already there. The celebration makes the day meaningful, not the date.

Seriously?", "This is his dream job, something he always he wanted and in his field very difficult to find ,( it took him almost 20 years to find this) so if he is living and doing his dream job he should give up because it's abt hour from our house. If he does it with love and I love my husband why I should tell him to stop and find something else?", "NTA \n\nThat sounds exhausting! You should stay home.", "NTA. Can you host his parents one year? Celebrate collectively ?", "Then he can visit his family himself.", "Gonna assume your husband doesn't commute with a 3yo?", "NTA but it all sounds like a lot.  Can you host Christmas so both families can join you?  Does his family ever come to you, or always you to them?", "I feel very lucky re: in-law relationships with my husband and I.  He and my family really get on well - he share my dad\u2019s sense of humor and they\u2019re both math nerds, and he\u2019s such a nice guy you really have to work to not like him.  His family and I aren\u2019t as close, partly due to proximity (we lived 2 hours\u2019 drive from my parents for 6 years and are in the same major metro as my paternal grandparents, but have never lived near his parents), partly due to my MIL and I just making each other a bit anxious, but his parents are good, kind people even if they\u2019ve sometimes struggled a bit to understand and work with my admittedly complex and unpredictable disability.\n\nWe had to stop splitting Christmas when his grandfather moved in with his parents because they only had 1 good guest bed, and it became his room - I just couldn\u2019t sleep on the terrible back-up guest beds they got due to my disability, and then the pandemic hit, and his grandmother lives with them now.", "Goodness, how frustrating!", "You would probably not be shocked to know that she\u2019s a boundary stomper in many other ways lol", "While I disagree with the comment as a whole, I think the commute really just depends on location. Where I live, an hour long commute is very common, simply because I'm near a big city but far enough away that housing and such is affordable."]}
