Again of course, workplace cultures can be very different.", "Are you seriously confusing an internet opinion poll with an actual legal trial?  There is no punishment.  There are no legal ramifications. This isn't an actual jury. Who the hell is charging a crime? What the hell are you talking about? No one here has any power.  Nothing here is remotely serious.  You really gotta tone it down a notch.  lol. \n\nThat's not what OP did, OP cracked the door open for further questions.   OP brought up his coworkers isolating him for his crimes for a reason, people can ask what that reason was.  OP ain't gotta answer but they can ask.  See how easy that is? \n\nI never said they were justified in being rude to him.  You gotta read, I said his legal issues COULD justify the reason they were being rude to him if we knew what they were.  I simply said that added information that he provided could be useful information in getting the entire picture of events. \n\nYou really need to relax.  Maybe rub one out before getting online or something. You have way too much energy and passion attached to a bland conversation about asking for details.", "The co-workers might have been involved. We don\u2019t know, just like we don\u2019t know if he\u2019s innocent.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t legally convicted so he isn\u2019t facing legal consequences, but human relationships aren\u2019t decided by a judge or a court", "Slightly unrelated but why would donating the body be worse? Again Jews don\u2019t do open casket so donating seems like the obvious way to go but again it\u2019s just a cultural difference I guess. Grief can be strange and everyone grieves differently I guess. \n\nI also have only worked with people close to my age who don\u2019t have kids and whose parents are 75+ so that\u2019s probably a contributing factor to the fact that I\u2019ve never heard of this aside from being Jewish.", "Donated bodies can be used in crash tests, or weapons tests, or be dissected by medical students. If it\u2019s cost related and not part of an established plan for after one\u2019s passing, the family has no say in how the body is used or where it\u2019s donated. Overall, I think it\u2019s more about the guilt that those that remain would feel. My partner still says constantly that his dead mother probably hates him now because she was buried in the ground and expressed that she never wanted that when she was alive. It\u2019s been 10 years and he still feels guilty about it."]}
