His side piece (because it appears that\u2019s how he treats you) pays for everything, leaving him money to spend on the woman he\u2019s still pining for. Dude\u2019s got it made! \nYou\u2019re NTA.

If he had plenty of money, his gift wouldn\u2019t be an issue. But you\u2019re funding your dates, and he\u2019s so broke, he can\u2019t get you a Christmas gift?

Of course you want to be a priority, and if gift giving in general wasn't his thing, that would be one thing.    Buying her gifts but expecting you to pay for dates is pretty cheap on his part.

My bf has 3 kids with his ex Kim. They are 18, 16 and 13.\nHe always says he doesn't have money to go out so whenever I want to go somewhere, like out for dinner, I pay. \nNot long after just such an occasion,  Kim's birthday came up. My bf said he was going to buy her a gift. I asked if it was a gift from the kids or from him. He said it was from him. I questioned why he thought that was necessary.  His reply was to show the kids that their parents still get along. I understand its important to have a cordial relationship with her but is a gift necessary?  Acknowledge her birthday , buy her a card.He said he was going to do this every year and wasn't going to change who he was because I didn't approve. \nI let it go.\nNow Christmas is approaching and he says he can't afford to buy me anything. I don't care about the gift however it makes me feel unimportant to him. Kim's birthday was a priority and he found money for her gift.\nI told him how that made me feel and now I'm getting the silent treatment.\nAm I the asshole here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
