Is she your dad\u2019s secret biological child or something?", "OP, you know the difference between right and wrong, and your gift to Amy was an expression of that. And it was a public expression, addressing the inequity to the people treating her poorly even though they are your bio fam. This is so important. Having someone stand up and say \u201cthis is wrong and you deserve better\u201d will help give Amy a basis for how she goes through the world. Can I say though, if you have the means for it, Amy should probably talk to a professional about how she grew up and was treated.", "NTA. It's not on you to \"save\" Amy, but she will be so so thankful that you are helping.", "Lol yeah NTA. You have a relationship with Amy and nothing with your brother. Also he\u2019s going to be fine as they will pay for him. \n\nGood luck to your parents. I see you and Amy going LC and they can have their golden child.", "NTA. I don't think you are an asshole -- you did the right thing but you have potentially made her living situation more hostile. It's clear you disagree with how your parents have treated her and they sound scummy but they are still your parents. There was probably a better way to handle it. You only mentioned your brother in this a couple of times so I'm not sure why you would be the asshole for not paying for him to go to college. Shouldn't your parent be paying for him since he's the most favored? If your brother does not get offered a scholarship he most likely doesn't deserve to go but that is just my opinion. Most likely if your sister is doing well she will get offered a scholarship. \n\nThe best situation for your app without knowing more is selling it to investors. You can always get a job after selling your app and it makes your resume look outstanding from a hiring perspective. It's not like you would be hired at an entry level position.", "NTA for helping her, but as a former foster youth, she likely qualifies for scholarships and grants.", "in a world where Amy has lost everything, at least she has you.  \nOP what you did was great, dont change a thing.  \nThe thing about your parents are they are modern day slave owners.   \nYour brother sounds like the golden child   \n\n\nGet your sister out of there asap please, is sounds really really fkd up situation. \n\nNTA", "NTA.

Your money, your choice,  your parents will take care of Dick.", "YUP.  I'm curious as to when your parents started fostering Amy. Because its a known thing that in some states in the USA, fostering a older child will get you a nice big paycheck from the state every month, and some terrible people just foster some older kids to be their live in help as well as collect that  monthly check.  Whether your parents did that or not, they clearly are treating Amy badly, and I'm so glad you have her back.  NTA", "While it is true that it is mine, maybe I should not have gotten emotional in the moment at Christmas and made that promise to Amy another time. It just hurts me so much to see her being treated like that when she is such a great person and it is amazing that she has not broken down mentally and still does well in school despite all this.", "It was always kind of a forbidden topic in the family that no one could bring up, however I did hear my father tell one of his friends when he thought I was not hope that he is lucky he has Amy who does all the house work as with such a big house maids would be expensive so I wonder if it was for that.\n\nThey treated her quite nice while she was a foster but things changed after she was adopted. There was another foster girl they did not adopt and Amy was the more polite and rather shy one.", "That is true, however truth be told my brother and I do not really get along as he can be quite toxic. I am worried though that my actions might cost both me and my sister a relationship with our family and we do not really have much family in the country.", "My post makes it seem worse since I cannot add everything due to the character limit. It is a topic my parents always make sure no one speaks about but when she was a foster, they treated her much better and they had another girl too but did not adopt her.\n\nShe was not hit frequently or anything, she was just a submissive type and they took advantage of that while providing her with only the bare minimum. So definitely unequal and not treated as a real daughter but not a complete slave either, so she had to grow up like a child in a poor family would while we were pretty upper middle class.\n\nI had it better than her but I feel like there was some misogyny and I was seen as lesser than my brother but I was still treated ok.", "My parents are a little sexist and they gave Dick more liberty and he usually gets what he wants and they trust him a lot even though he isnt the most mature.", "I think the reason they wanted me to be a doctor was because they are old fashioned and liked the idea of the Dr title in the family. CS isn't low earning nor is comp eng but they kept trying to dismiss it as not a real profession. They have not had this discussion afaik with my brother and  my parents have shown slightly sexist tendencies.", "It seems like this when summarized due to the character limit but it is more nuanced, she was not beaten and stuff, she was made to grow up as an unequal poorer child than us. And there was misogyny that I had to go through as well but I had a nicer room etc, it just felt that they almost resented me whenever I was successful at things .\n\nShe ate with us, came on vacation with us and all she just was not encouraged to participate in conversations and stuff and kind of turned down if she or I ever tried to include her.\n\nWe are both conventionally attractive, but they complimented me but not her on looks and never let her have any makeup or let me share mine unless it was for occasions like weddings.", "That is unlikely since she originally came in as a foster. She was treated quite nicely as a foster but it gradually changed once the adoption was finalized.", "I can definitely help her with that. I am in no means well of just got lucky for my age, so I do not have millions. And there is risk so I might not have this luck forever but I really feel like Amy deserves the help and I cannot afford to help anyone else.\n\nAmy has recently opened up to me more about these topics but only over text message (her phone is secure from them). I could easily get her professional therapists but I do not think she would want to go until she leaves my parents place or has the time for it will all her responsibilities. \n\nI have myself used these services available on my campus.\n\nI have been advising Amy for college applications and stuff and am trying my best so she gets into a top ranking school.", "Thanks, yeah I am a little worried about that. \n\nI assume my brother will have no issue getting paid or even just retiring and staying with them for all I know.\n\nIt really depends, I have almost graduated and I already make more from it and could afford a few employees than I would from most jobs, but there are investment opportunities where I could still be a part of the company and that is what I am considering once I graduate.", "There are some I think, but I do not want her to have to pick going to a worse school or the country where she chooses to study based on that, we will apply for anything that works for her school of choice. There are also accommodation costs but if she lives near me she could stay with me, although she might want to stay closer to her campus if I am not close enough", "I do not want to disclose personal details about location, but my parents were sufficiently well off where I do not think any check would change their lives but then again nor would hiring a maid.", "Actually, doing it like that, in front of everyone and being rather emotional, is the best thing you could have done for Amy. Her seeing you stand up for her had to mean the world to her, even if she can\u2019t say it.", "I\u2019m sure having you publicly advocate your support meant a lot to her.  \n\nYou are not the AH here.\n\nYou\u2019re actually the quiet hero.", "So they adopted her to enslave her. I hope she leaves their house, goes NC, and NEVER goes back.", "Oh my god, are your parents the Dursleys? \n\nNTA, obviously. You are a great sister.", "There were children sent on adoption trains in the US and some were adopted to be farmlands or maids and mistreated. Others were adopted into families who loved them.", "Calling someone out on their bad behavior is always a risk. But I think the greater risk is giving in to those who would keep you down. Is that relationship so valuable if they squash you both like this?", ">  I am worried though that my actions might cost both me and my sister a relationship with our family \n\n'and nothing of value was lost'. If your parents are going to treat her like this, you'd be a saint giving her refuge from what sounds like indentured servitude. Amy did not choose to be adopted by your parents, she doesn't need to 'repay' them for them choosing to adopt her.", "So she was basically mentally and emotionally abused.", "No i think your post doesn\u2019t do what Amy went through justice. Your comments paint a better picture of the severity of the situation. She was beaten? Enslaved ? And emotionally abused. She\u2019s not a daughter to them I hope you understand that. She was treated as maid. But since maids get paid she\u2019s a slave.", "It's really too bad, they aren't doing him any favors.", ">My parents are a little sexist \n\nEven in this day and age, I still see the boy child favored in families. Sexism isn't going away anytime in the foreseeable future", "I suspect that \"low earning field of CS\" was sarcastic.\n\nSource: 12 years living in Silicon Valley where the tech industry drives one of the highest Area Median Incomes in the USA", "OP, that is seriously fucked up. Your parents belong in jail for what they are trying to do to the child they adopted. Good for you for helping her escape.", "OP, there are non-physical types of abuse and it really sounds like emotional abuse of your poor adopted sister. Persuading someone to feel \"lesser than\" or guilty for things they can't control (such as being a foster kid and then adopted) is definitely abuse. It's a control tactic that can be very effective in making someone feel they don't have options other than being an unpaid servant. That's why people are saying this sounds like human trafficking for forced labor. Not because she was beaten.", "Would you be able to hire your sister?", "They were not physically violent, but gave her the childhood of a poor family while me and Dick grew up affluent. \n\nIt was never explicit, like she had a room but it was worse, she was not told to not participate in family conversations but it was frowned upon (I tried many times to include her and they would change topics or talk over her)", "Nah the Dursley's still treated Harry better than OP's parents.", "My maternal grandfather\u2019s family adopted a boy from an orphan train despite having like 10 kids already. I don\u2019t think he was treated well because I didn\u2019t find out about him until I was a teen, and had never met him despite meeting other great aunts and uncles. I have no idea what happened to him.", "I know what you mean, I just feel in a tough spot as I really love my sister and want to see her shine, I know she can also get into top schools and she deserves it as she works really hard in school despite having so much house work.\n\nIt is hard because I am also still young, I have made enough to be safe for around 5 years even if I paid for the best schools for Amy (and Amy also said she could help with my company but I dont want her too unless it is during summers). I fear that if my company fails or something I might be putting us in a tough spot having no relationship with my parents.\n\nI feel like my parents are making me chose between them and her and that is hard. If I went along and did not treat Amy like a real sister like they did I could be benefiting a lot from my parents financially in their will etc, and I do not wish bad things on them although I do not want them to harm Amy either.", "You could say that yes, but she was always made to believe that it could be a lot worse and to be grateful for having a roof and that sort of thing. Which is true it could be worse but that doesn't make it ok", "Easily but she has a lot on her plate right now, and I want her to experience university without distractions and work hard and have fun. But during summers she could definitely help out as she has the background. It might be more work on me to onboard her than someone with more experience but it should be possible, however I do not want her to feel any obligations, if she gets an internship at Microsoft of Google or something she should do that instead as it will look better.", "She did not have to be physically beaten to be enslaved.", "No they were emotionally abusive. It seems your parents really did a number on you too believing this is normal. I\u2019m sorry for that truly. Get out and get her out. This is insane. Are you serious. Frowned upon to participate in family conversations. She\u2019s a slave and this honestly needs to be reported. Your parents are abusive assholes omg", "That's sad. Orphan trains seemed like a good idea but the organizers were doing a crapshoot with other people's lives.\n\nDo you do genealogy or is there someone who would tell you?", "You will probably end up at least low contact with your folks since you just stole their live in servant.

That is not going to change for the better. If you continue to be awesome and support your sister they are going to be angry with you. Based on their behavior and your overheard conversation your parents didn\u2019t adopt Amy because they loved her and wanted to see her thrive. They adopted her because she was compliant and they wanted a house servent they wouldn\u2019t have to pay. You didn\u2019t get quite as much of the negative, but your parents are not good people.

Your parents are horrible people.", "I am not saying it was right what they did. It is just that Amy seems to have taken it like well it could be worse.\n\nObviously I hate how she was treated and I know it is not normal to have that kind of treatment, I am just saying they covered their bases by doing things indirectly so if anyone questions them about it they will be like well Amy sits and eats with us, went on vacation with us etc.", "I think my eldest aunt could tell me, I just haven\u2019t been in contact recently.", "You are right. I do not think I was treated as well as my brother either even though I am biological but at least I was not doing the job that a maid should have been doing.", "I just want to say the only reason Amy took it that way is because that\u2019s all she knows. She came from the system and then put into a situation where she doesn\u2019t get love sure she has her own room but she has to work. She doesn\u2019t know better and she doesn\u2019t know how to advocate for herself.

It\u2019s rich that your parents complain about you favoring your sister while treating her poorly, but treating your brother like the golden child.\n\nTo be frank, I think you and Amy need to cut your parents loose soon as possible.

Deliberately?", "> Why did they even adopt her\n\nShe was treated well while she was fostered, there was another girl too who was not adopted. Amy was the more quiet and overly nice of the two and they treated her well then.

Once you get her on her own and she feels safe, the trauma could catch up with her and make her fall apart.\n\nWhen I got out of my abusive house, I went from the top of my classes, high acheiving high performance, to failing them and barely able to function. Took a lot of therapy and meds to get me functional again.\n\nLook up c-PSTD, which is Complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. When the trauma is ongoing, the symptoms and onset are different. Please get things in order for Amy's mental health care to start as soon as she gets free of your parents.

I have no advice for seeking custody of a minor, but maybe something to research to to weigh against waiting for her birthday.", "It sounds like that's a good cost to take.

You are now aware of that fact, however much they try to hide or excuse it, and refusing to help her will also be wrong. This isn't about asshole behavior. This is about human rights.", "I missed that somewhere...", "Maybe because foster kids\u2019 placements are supervised by child welfare workers.", "This to me implies they willingly adopted her just to be a live-in indentured servant.

At least one thing is taking care of itself.\n\nThat said, Amy needs to get out of there soon as possible. After scrolling through your comments, it is clear your parents have malicious intentions.", "Don't fret about that. Sometimes the trash takes itself out. \n\nPS: tell Amy to have her college applications sent with your address. Your parents may well sabotage her by throwing out any acceptance letters.", "I wish you guys luck!

But a casual family friend or stranger or teacher would not easily realize anything was wrong. From their perspective they see parents who adopted a child to a large home, goes on vacations with everyone etc. \n\nI know my parents suck and I have experienced issues from them as well although I was not the unpaid maid. I was just wondering if I was the AH for doing it on Christmas and for ignoring my brother who is who he is partly because of my parents.", "Oh definitely. I know it is wrong and terrible to do, I am just saying that they have done their best to pretend like nothing is wrong, so if you confront them they will be like how dare you, we take her on vacation with us, we love her, she comes to restaurants with the family etc.\n\nSo many outsiders think everything is fine and if they were investigated it wouldnt look deliberately awful like a Dickens story.", "That is what I suspect these days, but it is not blatantly obvious (as my OP is a summary due to the char limit).\n\nLike Amy came on vacations, she ate with us, she does get presents, birthdays etc but it is just a really bad celebration for her versus us. And she is not directly told to participate in family conversations, but they make it such that she doesn't want to and indirectly shut it down when I attempted to include her.", "That is some good advice, they might try to anonymously contact universities to slander her. I strongly suspect they did this when they found some of my company clients once. Maybe I can get her a postal box in the area too.\n\nLuckily these days college tracking is also online.", "Thanks!", "I suspect that but they never told me that. She and another girl were fostered but only she was adopted. She was very shy, polite and extremely nice and they treated her quite well while she was a foster.

It was not like cinderella like 24/7 work but it was still pretty awful and at least while I was there I would help her out whenever I could which makes me feel so bad for leaving for uni and leaving her there as it is probably worse now.\n\nWhen her computer broke, my parents did not get her another one (hers was ancient and a hand me down) and that made school and her hobbies of learning programming hard (I think the reason we both got into it was it was something we can do quietly without anyone knowing).

Not that you'd be obligated to pay for him if you were the only one able to, but your parents seem to have a particular fetish for making other people do things they could easily afford to do for themselves.  Which isn't really surprising, it's not about money it's about control, that's why they're also trying to sabotage your side gig.  You can't have money that's not dependent on them, and if you do then they'll still try to force you to use it how they want.\n\nSorry your parents are shitbags, happy you seem to have turned out decent despite it, hope Amy is the same.", "Nta", "Good for you.

My mum sabotaged my leaving at 18 and although she was horrible I never thought she would go that far, yet she did. Keep your parents out of the loop on information about you are doing.

It's great you're helping your sister but from the comments it looks like you may also be minimizing the abuse she experienced. I hope both of you are able to heal from this experience.

Good you're in a place where you can help her.", "NTA.  You do favor her,.but in an attempt to offset the years of favortism your parents have shown your brother.\n\nI am curious why they adopted her after fostering her because from what you described it doesnt even sound like they like her.", "OK, so this sounds very like the plot of Cinderella, but I'm going to go ahead and say NTA. It is absolutely gross and horrible of your parents to say to Amy at the age of 17 that she is expected to stay and care for them in their very middle-, not-at-all-old age. I hope she gets out, and you stay away, and they can contemplate their own poor judgement in isolation.", "NTA", "NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA. You\u2019re the best sister ever.

Your parents sound toxic and abusive.\n\nCongratulations to you on your success!", "NTA.\n\nPoor Amy only has you, your brother Dick probably gets all the help he needs from your parents, so if you help both Dick gets twice the help Amy gets, how does that sound fair?\n\n> and they say I favor her\n\nWell look who's talking, lol. Maybe you wouldn't have to favour Amy if your parents would have done their job and treated you all equal.", "Jesus. It sounds like your parents only adopted Amy to be a permanent live in maid.

Help your sister out", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like someone needs to care about this girl. Good on you for stepping up.", "Your parents literally adopted Amy so they have someone to take care of them when they retire....they groomed her to be their free maid.

I hope you're parents get their karma", "I\u2019m guessing they never intended to pay for her college no matter what degree she wanted to pursue.", "Your parents probably brought her in as a pretty much live in maid. Once you take Amy out of there I would suggest you make a call to your local adoption agencies and tell them that your parents if they do come calling that they're just looking for a maid in the house.", "So basically they adopted a child so they could have a maid.\n\nPlease document and call CPS equilivent on them and let CPS know you will take in Amy.", "Sometimes someone needs someone else to get mad for them.

She was conditioned to take emotional mistreatment from your parents well and the apathy, whether purposeful or not, from you and your brother.\n\nIf your parents weaponize you to ultimately choose them over finally treating Amy like a sister, hell, a person. Then that will have a significant impact on her psyche.

She wanted her to held with chores and her younger kids. She thought it was a fair deal because she'd get help and the 14 year old would have a roof over her head. Of course she got torn a new one in the comments but it shows there really are sickos out there with the mentality that foster kids should be sooooo grateful that they become house elves."]}
