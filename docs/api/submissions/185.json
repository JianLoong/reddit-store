My husband has been snapping with a woman that randomly added him on Snapchat I found out a few weeks ago. I was putting his phone on the charger like I do most days after he gets off work and falls asleep watching YouTube. I saw a notification that said he has a snap for a girl named Rachel. I I ignored it figuring it was a friend from school or church. She sent another right as I was putting it down and I opened it to let her know he'd message her when he woke up. I figured it must be important to send 4 messages within less than 5 minutes. My husband woke up for dinner and I asked if he responded to Rachel that she messaged him while he was asleep and he seemed confused who I was talking about. I dropped it figuring it must not be too important. A few days go by and he hasn't messaged me during work or really acknowledged my presence when home. So I look at Snapchat to see if he'd snapped her back. He had been messaging her for about 5-6 days while at work and home. I asked him who she was and he said a random girl that added him. He had sent her a picture from his senior photos from high school, and said he sent it cause she asked for a photo of him. I told him that him snapchatting a random girl he doesn't know made me uncomfortable. He said sorry and for 2 weeks he didn't message her. Last night I was plugging his phone up again and saw a snap from Rebecca and was confused of who she was. I asked my husband and he said she added him sometime that morning. I had read the name wrong before and thought her name was Rachel. I told him no it's the same girl from 2 weeks ago and asked him to not message her again that she made me uncomfortable. He asked if I was going to start going through his phone now and I told him no. The only reason I knew it's Rebecca is cause I saw the notification and that he shouldn't have lied about who she was. I explained that I had no problem if he messaged girls he personally knew cause they know he's married and that they would respect it and not cross any inappropriate boundaries. He told me she knew he was married. I asked if he'd be okay if I messaged a random guy I don't know and didn't tell him and then ignored him the whole time. During their 5-6 day snap streak many of my text to him during work want ignored and he didn't talk to me when he got home except to ask me to put clothes in the bathroom for his shower. He was messaging her the whole time tho. We didn't talk for about an hour after I asked. He eventually said he was sorry and I apologized for going through his Snapchat but told him again to stop sending her snaps.

He\u2019s prioritising messaging strangers over his wife and by the sounds of it is already starting an emotional affair. You\u2019re right to be concerned and ask him to stop.

If not, you need to decide if you\u2019re willing to have random online women forever if your life.", "NTA sounds like you guys need to have a serious talk, because he will continue this and likely do worse if allowed.\n\nAlso jeez I thought Snapchat was dead, I only ever see it mentioned on news stories about teens buying drugs.

You better dump him before it gets worse", "Nta", "I have never understood why anyone feels comfortable messaging/following/friending people they don\u2019t know on social media. It\u2019s beyond weird. People trying to get others to subscribe to their porn channel, cat-fishers, scammers and predators. No one should be accepting these requests. Your husband included. He\u2019s talking about his marriage and sending photos to some internet stranger? Rachel and Rebecca could be anyone; I guarantee it\u2019s a scam.
