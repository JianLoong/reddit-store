My whole block usually keeps to themselves, so I\u2019ve never talked to them before. It\u2019s a large family with lots of kids, ages ranging around 8-13yo. They got a new puppy recently, and while the kids were outside playing with it, I heard yelling and screaming, so I peeked out the window from my couch to see if everyone was okay. I saw that the kids were swatting at the dog with their jacket sleeve and kicking it as it was trying to jump on them. It wasn\u2019t hard kicks or swats, but just more of a push to get the dog off of them, so I didn\u2019t think much of it. More screaming continued, so I looked over again and saw the smallest kid STOMP on the dog while yelling at it. I didn\u2019t want to go out and yell at these kids, mostly because I\u2019ve never interacted with the parents, let alone the kids. I went to google who said to alert authorities to issue them a warning, and if it persists, animal control will take the dog away. I debated doing anything because I don\u2019t want this to come around, full circle, back to me as the one who reported it (I know, selfish) but I called the non emergency police line of my county and reported it. They said they would send an officer out to check things out, but I told them I didn\u2019t want to be involved afterwards, so I\u2019m not sure what came of it and I never actually saw a police car there. I shut my blinds after calling since it was getting dark anyway. I know in my heart of hearts, what I did was right for the sake of that poor dog, but I can\u2019t help but feel like I could\u2019ve approached the parents and let them know what was going on.

Communicate that animals (and people) deserve to not be harmed. Like... If the kids are abusing a dog, that's absolutely a red flag as fuck for the kids being abused or neglected. Call CPS if you need to as well."]}
