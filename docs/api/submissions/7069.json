Due to this I take my grades at school very seriously, as it's obviously very important for my acceptance to this program. I'm not the biggest fan of group projects because you usually always have those one or two group members who don't pull their weight the same as the other members.\n\nIn one of my classes my teacher assigned us a group project and let us choose our groups, 5 people per group. I asked the three girls in the row behind me if they wanted to be in a group as we're pretty friendly with each other and I know for a fact that they take the class seriously, and care about their grades. The girl who sits directly beside me asked to be in our group too. We said for sure as again, it's obvious she's a good student and cares about the class.\n\nNow there's a girl who sits in the row behind me who is friends with the 3 girls in my group named \"Sarah\". It's very obvious that Sarah could care less about this class. She constantly tries to copy off of my 3 other group members work, which they have expressed annoyance about. She sits on her phone the entire time in class or is just sitting there talking. She leaves to go to the \"bathroom\" AT LEAST 3 times per class, just to walk around the halls etc. Sarah asked if she could join our group. I was hesitant to say yes, as I knew we were being marked as a GROUP not individually. One of the other girls in my group said yes.\n\nNot to my surprise, Sarah didn't pull her weight as expected, so we shortened her part she was responsible for. She didn't finish her part until the day of her presentation.\n\nWe began presenting and everything was going smoothly. Right before it was Sarah's part she needed to present she just walked out of class. The other group member who is friends with Sarah ran after her. Everyone looked confused, including our teacher, but he told us to continue and finish.\n\nAt the end of class Sarah came back with our other group member, we asked her why she left in the middle of the presentation? She said that she was feeling extremely anxious an overwhelmed because her ex best friend is in this class, and it was affecting her from presenting. All of us were clearly annoyed and I told her that if she was feeling anxious she should've told us BEFORE HAND, so that we could talk to our teacher about alternatives. I told her that doing this is inconsiderate of the other group members. She started going off on me calling me an AH saying that we should be considerate of her and her anxiety. I told her I would be if she had told us about it before hand. We did loose marks due to Sarah. AITA for getting upset here?\n\n**(EDIT:** I should add that our teacher made it clear to the class before hand that we only have one chance to present.

She had no excuse, sounds like she didn't actually do the work that it was not up to proper quality.", "NTA, I am also someone with anxiety and have even had to do a project with, at the time, a recent ex best friend. The appropriate thing that she should have done is the talk to the teacher and the group before hand. Her anxiety does not excuse her from the negative outcomes of her actions. What she did is inconsiderate, especially since it affected everyone in the group\u2019s grades. I hope the group talks to the teacher so that not everyone\u2019s grade is affected.", "NTA.

Use all sorts of group pressuring to get your grades adjusted. Get the problem fixed before playing the blame game.\n\nSomething similar happened to me in college.

Spoke to my professor and she fixed me a full grade, then it didn't matter who was at fault anymore.", "INFO: was Sarah's ex best friend doing anything to make her anxious? Giving her looks, whispering, laughing etc?", "You should be upset with your teacher, since they shouldn't have done what they did. \n\nGet your parents involved and go complain to the school.\n\nOn the flip side, your grades aren't gonna suffer that bad.

Everything you said is correct, and you portray yourself acting respectfully and concisely. \n\nThe real question is was that really how it went down? Were you really calm and respectfully said in a reasonable tone and volume \u201cif you had said something about your anxiety we could have talked to the teacher\u2026\u201d or was it more like \u201cWELL WTF SARAH WHY DIDNT SAY THAT BEFORE?!?!\u201d.

It can blind you. \n\nYou\u2019re in high school so still very young. I\u2019m 28, still very young, but situations like this happen to me all the time. I try SO hard to be respectful and polite but I am a passionate person who cares deeply about what I do, and people who do not know me well get taken aback by my tone and attitude. My emotions get in the way of logic and reason. Recognizing this and controlling it is part of emotional intelligence. \n\nMy point here is just because right here I don\u2019t think you\u2019re being an AH, I have a feeling the conversation could have gone differently, where you could have said the same things to Sarah in a different way, and her reaction would not have been as extreme. It\u2019s a fool\u2019s choice to believe you either have to be honest with someone and offend them, or bite your tongue and say nothing so the person does not hate you.", "ESH- \n\nThese are grades and it's a group project. Everyone hates group projects... Know what a workplace is? A group project. People hate work... It's just true. So with that said you can take the pious 'but my grades are serious business' and toss it..  sure grades can matter but also they are not the only thing, biggest thing, or most important thing in life...

It's embarrassing. \n\nYour mutual friend: how in all of this 'serious work' did your mutual friend who supposedly knows Sarah never mention this was a thing? \n\nAs for your teacher, your teacher clearly knows more about what's up than you do.  It sounds like Sarah has some accomodations... Ya know folx with mental health concerns in school are often allowed breaks during class to walk around. It's not cause they are lazy it's because they need a break so they don't have a meltdown or a panic attack in the middle of class... And my guess is you'd hate that disruption.

Unfortunately, there is going to be a lazy moocher in any group, which is why group projects are very unpopular in school and in real life. The difference being that in real life, lazy moochers tend to get fired sooner or later, since no one wants to do their work.", "It's legiotimate for you and the other members of the group to be upselt. I think it would be reasonable for you to go to Sarah and ask her to arrange to speak  to the teacher, or get her paretns to do so, to expalin about her anxiety. IDeally she should have raised it prior to the presentation so that appropriate accommodations could have beenamde - maybe having your group go first so shehad less time to get stressed, or even having her part be non-speaking or pre-recorded. \n\nIt is a terrible system and very unfair - and the teacher is being unfair in penalising you for her actions, ESH. If dh has a geneuine dability / health issue then refusing a do-over might be unfair / discrimnatory so it may be worth talkingwithSarah abotu the group of you raising that as a group, initially with him and then with the principal or whoever is responsiblefor the school adhearing to relvant disbaility / anti dsicrimination laws. If you are in the US I think the relvant law is the Americans with Disabilities Act but I don't know how it applies to schools \n\nWhile Sarah probably could have stopped to explain herself before running out, if she was havng an anxiety attak, she could have reduced the risks - if she'd done her partaealier then you would all have had time to practive the presentation, and could have shared notes so one of you might have been able to pick up and finish presenting her section when she disappeared.", "Let's start with you ar NTA.\n\nBut then I wonder, why did you let Sarah join the group when you already had your 5 person group?  Also why didn't the \"friend\" inform you that Sarah has anxiety issues? With this information you could have arranged to let her present first and not have to stew in her own fears.", "INFO I know groups projects suck but are you saying that a student left class without permission from the teacher and that same teacher is still punishing the whole group?", "Nta. Can you talk to the teacher and explain you guys did what you could and if it is possible to grade her separately from you or allow you a project to make up some of the grade you missed? I don\u2019t know how seriously the grade is or if it effects your finally grade?", "You can be mad, I'd be mad as hell. But her anxiety probably only started when she was standing in the front. If she ran out, she probably had a panic attack. She probably couldn't tell you before. YTA for offering 0 understanding at all. Ask your teacher for a redo. If the teacher declines, they're also an asshole.", "NTA. The good news is that you won't be suckered with this again. You now know to stand up and say \"No, we're good with the group we've got.\" It will help you avoid similar situations at work with coworkers that want to leech off you and take credit. The bad news is that her failure affected your grade, and yes, it's 100% on her. She let her personal drama impact your lives and it was absolutely avoidable just by telling you all that it was a problem ahead of time. I think it wasn't a problem with an ex-friend, I think she just hadn't rehearsed and didn't want to embarass herself.  You're NTA for getting upset and NTA for chewing her out in front of the class, should you so desire, when you get your grades for that project.", "Every group project sucks because someone latches on to the kids who care about grades to try and get a good one without any work. And when the teacher is a dick everyone suffers for it.", "I'm unsure if she spoke to the teacher. But she explained herself to us, as I mentioned in the post. Our teacher expressed to us before hand that each group had only one chance to present. If we had spoke to him before hand I'm 100% he would've came up with an alternative or accommodated Sarah in some way.", "The teacher's strictness re: grading sounds pretty tough for high school, particularly since a group member publicly flaked. OP, I think that it would be worthwhile to speak with the teacher to explain what happened and see if there's any wiggle room in grading the group members who carried out the assignment. Also, maybe Sarah should be referred for a mental health assessment by the teacher. \n\nSadly, you're likely to face even more disappointing group projects. I suffered through them in undergrad, and then in my masters program 20 years later!\n\nNTA", "A LOT of teachers will make those exceptions in private but not in front of the class, or the other students will immediately start clamoring for special care too. Meet with the teacher before or after school or during their office hours, as a group minus flake, and explain that you had no idea she wasn't going to present until she walked out. You sent someone after her, it was the best you could do, and it wasn't something any of you could have prevented or foreseen. See what the teacher says.", "So he pulled us aside and asked us what happened at the end of the presentation. We explained to him that we didn't know (Sarah had not come back to class yet). He asked if anyone was with her, we told him one of the other group members was. \n\nHe said that unfortunately he made it clear that each group had one chance to present, to keep thing's fair, and that Sarah's actions were unfortunately going to affect the rest of the group. \n\nPretty much instead of getting a A+ we got a B+, but this presentation was worth a good percentage of our overall grade in the class.", "I agree.

She wasn't even paying attention to the presentation.", "For some students, grades are very important. In high school, my grades were basically my whole life. They affect your future, and for some students, affects your relationship with your parents. This project may have been worth a lot of points. I would not be chill about this at all, especially towards the teacher.", "I'm a teacher. I tell my students to chose their groups wisely. Pick people that you know are good workers, or if they aren't good at the subject, are good at team work, at drawing and design, or otherwise can be counted on to contribute. I tell them that in a perfect class, I'll have a handful of busy groups and one group with four people looking at each other and waiting for SOMEONE to start doing the work. And I think that's glorious. So pick wisely, they can choose any table and group, they can refuse anyone, and if it turns out they have a bad team? They can politely request that another group add them. So far, it's worked out really well. I start the year telling them to pay attention to how the other students do so they know who to pick! And in college? See who gets to class on time, gets their computer out, is prepared with paper and pencil, has their work ready to hand in, and pays attention and pick them immediately!", "Ok, I see his point. It might be worth bringing this up with a counselor then at the school or seeing if there is a way you could have a meeting between you, your teacher and your parents. I think there are two issues here\n\n1. That not only did Sara leave but that one of your group members went with her, thus making it worse\n\n2. When the teacher realized that this was something the rest of you didn\u2019t expect that he didn\u2019t somehow change or adjust his grading. Or offer an opportunity for peer review. I have had classes with group projects where i and other members needed to discuss ahead of time how we where splitting the percentage of who did what. Often it was when a group member really did not participate. From there it affected final score, so while I and the others who did the work and presentation got grades reflecting our work the person who slacked off received a more fair grading criteria. I think it\u2019s fair at this point to bring your parents into this and potentially a counselor. Sara fucked with your grade. If it means overall your total class score gets reduced to a b+ then I think it\u2019s fair to see if another solution can be met. \n\nAs a side note, if your final class grade goes from an A to and A- then I think you may find less sympathy from your teacher, parents and school admin to find a solution as an A- shouldn\u2019t be the reason you don\u2019t get into school.", "Teacher here. Hell yes we say that to the kids in the class, or we'll get every damn group wanting four re-dos and blowing off the first one. But work hard on the first project, meet with us in private, explain the situation and how you couldn't foresee or prevent it, and ask if there's extra work that can be done to make up for the bad grade? We'll probably do it. Just don't tell the other students (because the two other groups that approached us ALSO aren't telling the other students!). If it gets around that we do let them save a grade someone else tanked, too many will slack. But we're not evil.", "Those students are losers.", "I doubt a group project, where everyone is graded as a group and not individually, is worth a significant amount of their grade. If it is, then again, the teacher is in the wrong here as they have absolutely no control over her running out. It's very unfair of the teacher to grade as a group to begin with, but especially if it's worth enough, or their grade would be affected significantly that it will really change their GPA or change their letter grade at all. And if a parent was upset about a kids grade being lower because another student walked out, that's wild. \n\nMaybe ask teacher for extra credit as it's not their fault.", "Can I ask what you do about the random loner who may be a good student but is not picked by anyone just because they are a loner?", "I love that!", "Grow up.", "Losers who will go ahead and do good in life.", "Sometimes a group project makes up a big part of the final course grade. We just don't know that.", "NTA, but teachers should never grade as a group. Sorry, this is highschool, and some students are really lazy and unreliable. They should always grade individually.", "I hate group projects but they prepare you well for real work projects that are like this but worse", "NTA, Sarah is, and the teacher is a lazy AH for assigning group projects.", "NTA but your teacher and Sarah is too. I hope that you have a chance to take this to the school head and explain the situation. Good luck", "NTA\n\nOf course you can be upset, I would be too. Most people would be nervous (I know I would be in HS and college) with the public presentation but that is kind of the point. To do it and learn from the experience.

Group projects always seen to have that one person who doesn't care about the project. I can even sympathize with the girl who ran out because I have a terrible public speaking fear but that being said she should have said something ahead of time so that maybe her part during the actual presentation could have been scaled back.", "NTA. But if she can get up and walk out of class for anxiety. And the only thing that happens is your group loses points. Revisit the teacher about Sarah if she gets a pass for walking out for an anxiety attack. Thats not be fair to the group. Ask about points or redo", "NTA... Sarah has reached the top level of self absorption. Dont let her in your group next time.", "NTA but Sarah is and F that teacher too. They literally watched a student walk from the class, and then still held it against the group? That's batshit nuts. Unless this school is so discerning of its admissions that they also watch your senior year grades closely, I wouldn't work too much so long as you still pass with a decent mark. If you've already applied and sent transcripts they're gonna be far more focused on your first 3 years. They'll only generally look to year 4 to make sure you actually graduated and didn't go from A's and B's to barely passing. Though I say this basing it off the US system. I don't know if that's different elsewhere.", "This reminds me of when I was working in a dental office and an assistant got stressed during a procedure.  She got up and went for a walk outside....\nLeaving a bewildered dentist and patient in the chair. I was a receptionist that day and had to throw a lab coat on and go assist. \nWhen she was fired I heard she got a job as a paramedic.... hope she got her anxiety under control.", "NTA. I fucking hated group projects. You have my sympathies. I had a group in college with 3 guys. 2 were great, 1 was useless.

Wouldn't ya know it, he group graded us a D and said he refused to discuss it or change it. Such bullshit.", "holy shit. Sarah got a B+ too didn't she even though she deserved an F? That sucks and she did not learn her lesson. Of course you are upset with her.", "If I was you I'd raise hell. Talk to the teacher privately. If they still don't see reason go above them.", "And I\u2019m sure your instructions make the social dynamics between students go away completely for the duration of the project.\n\nOh wait, the other thing.\n\nNo matter what instructions you give, the group choices that your students make will have social consequences outside your class, and they know it.", "But \"picking the good workers\" means no matter how you do it, there will be \"bad workers\" paired with a good worker. There's no way to guarantee all good workers are paired with good workers because there is not a perfect distribution.", "If you can refuse anyone, then an unpopular student can't choose any group, can they?\n\nThey can only choose any group that will have them.\n\nYou're remarkably smug for an adult who is just choosing to reinforce the worst aspects of high-school social dynamics.\n\nImagine punishing the weakest students, and telling them it's their own fault, *and* publicly congratulating yourself for this.", "This just sounds like you encourage bullying though.", "Agreed, but OP's parents should just go straight to the head of the school and ask why someone else's uncontrollable actions are impacting OP's grades and future.", "I think you need to give the teacher a chance to solve it before going so far up the food chain. That\u2019s what counselors are for, and that\u2019s what parent/teacher meetings are for as well. If the teacher still refuses even after the group has come to him privately and explained the situation then it\u2019s time to elevate. But not elevate so far past the point of no return. Elevate incrementally. Anything more extreme then that could make dealing with this teacher or others in the school for OP more difficult. You don\u2019t want to be the kid who gets the principal to change your grade. And not all of the teachers will hear the whole story so if she has a new one next semester that only heard that she wasn\u2019t happy with her grade so she went to the principal that will mean she is starting out behind the 8 ball. It sucks but she needs to approach this with both eyes open and with the knowledge she may not be able to change her grade.

I would talk to your teacher and at least ask if your grade could be based just on what you *did* present. As much as I also disliked group work, I can understand why the teacher would grade you as a group (collaboration and teamwork and all that jazz) and not allow redos, but it\u2019s really unfair to drop the grade for the rest of you because of something you couldn\u2019t have anticipated or prevented.\n\nYou\u2019ve said you\u2019re sure that if you had talked to him before the presentation that he would be reasonable and allow some sort of accommodation. To me that sounds like you have a decent chance of getting him to change the grade if you approach/email him with a mature and reasonable argument. \n\n\u201cHi Mr. Whatever, I understand that you don\u2019t want to give our group an unfair advantage by letting us redo our presentation, but it doesn\u2019t feel fair to me that my grade was affected by something I had no control over when the rest of our project was A+ work. Would you consider grading me and the rest of my group based only on the parts we *did* present?\u201d Worst that can happen is he says no. \n\nAs for Sarah, she may not have expected to have that reaction and she may not have any control over it, but she still needs to be accountable for her actions, especially when they have a negative impact on others.

I am sorry you lost marks, but in the long run, it will be okay.", "NTA but explain all of this to your teacher.

Did the group checked her part before the presentation day? Why do I see a weak excuse because she didn't do her part, or it was BS and she knew it would not be acceptable for her to present it? Her anxiety don't means shit when it comes to deadlines and responsibility to others as a group. It's her responsibility to get help for her anxiety so it would not affect others and their grades.

In 15 years of being a prof, I never did that mainly for time constraints which is why I made that clear. It's one thing if I postponed a presentation because of an issue (an example of this would be a student got the avian flu and was in the hospital and even that was a true rarity), but redoing a presentation? Nope. Redoing a paper is one thing, re-doing a presentation is another.

All of the work praised in the feedback was the work I had done. I went to my teacher about this, and he said the highest he could give me was a B+.

I was the foreign kid who didn't speak the language well (I'd been in that country for exactly one year and was starting to get a hang of it, but school my work was all over the place, as I didn't always understand the teacher, and for this project we had to write a pretty long paper - for a 14yo - and do an oral presentation).\n\nI was obviously having trouble finding a group, because who wants to work with the guy who doesn't speak the language? Plus it would have been unfair to someone for them to have been forced to work with me. Well I was allowed to work alone, and it was my best damn \"group\" project for the whole of middle school. I did the work (and went overboard on it), I did it in my native language first, then redid it in the other language, rehearsed the pronunciations that I wasn't sure on, etc. I got 100% on it, and was the only group in the class that did.\n\nIf I had been forced to work with others I wouldn't have been able to do it the way I did it. Most of the work would be on the other people, and I'd just have been coasting on their thing, because I was the only one with the language barrier. Working alone allowed me to work at home and turn it into as much of a biology exercise as a language exercise.\n\n**Two**\n\nAnd last year of my uni degree I had to write a program in a group of 6. Two of us were supposed to work on the graphics UI (and I was working with one of my roommates). The groups were decided early in the year, but the meat of the project was the last week of school. Shortly before the main part, the roommate I was working with went hard off the rails at me (I think maybe his girlfriend had a crush on me? I still am not sure what went on, only that she was involved in it and kept trying to talk to me around when he went crazy hostile to me). Social stuff outside of group work absolutely comes into play and the guy completely blew off his part of the program to do something else (not required by the program specs), kept deleting huge swaths of my code before comitting (luckily we had subversions and I could easily restore it).\n\nTwo days before the presentation he tried to get the other members of the group to all go with him to complain to the teacher that I did nothing. Luckily I had my 3rd roommate as another group member to back me up but that shit could have gotten bad for me. (I think he did say something to the teacher, but I got marked a point higher than him so I assume my teacher looked at our code commits and made his own decision).\n\nOops, that got long. Sorry readers.", "I just don\u2019t think this is as serious of an issue to break out the chopping block. \n\nIf it truly lowers her to a b+ for the semester then maybe it\u2019s time to elevate further up the food chain. But honestly if it only changed her grade from an A to an A minus then a principal might not even entertain the issue. It\u2019s all based on how her final grade will shake out and for her and her parents to be prepared to contest the grade now with the teacher or with a counselor. \n\nYou and I may have different tactics here. But as someone who has been on both sides of the coin when it comes to grading (as a TA and as a student) I have seen people go to hard and end up making things more difficult. So it truly depends on how severely it affects her grade. So far OP said it brought her group project score from an A to a B+.
