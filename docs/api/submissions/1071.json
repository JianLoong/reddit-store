Needless to say i did not have a good time as ppl were drunk asf and kind of gettin on my nerves. All of my friends except one did not help me clean the place up even tho it was them pushing me to hire the place and stuff. Now to the problem a friend of mine asked me if he could stay the night in the buildin since his household would not tolerate him coming home drunk. I told him yes if he helped us clean the place, he said yes and we both agreed. Later when it was time to clean, he didn\u2019t do shit and he was busy tryna get a girls snapchat or something like that. So when i went beside them to reach for some papercups and drinks i heard the following: Friend: why are u moving so much\nGirl: im moving so ur friend can clean\nFriend: i don\u2019t give af \nSo after that i told him in front of the girl that he can pack his bags and leave. 15 min laters he comes back and tells asks me why i cocked blocked him and that he should\u2019ve told me that by takin him to the side and tell him to go start cleaning then. So am i the asshole for cockblocking him?
