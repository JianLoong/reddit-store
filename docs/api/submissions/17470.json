He makes a lot for our age, but he\u2019s off at work 10-6 but he\u2019s usually there finishing things, and sometimes stays until 7 or 8. Plus it\u2019s a 30 minute drive, so I don\u2019t see him until anywhere from 6:30-9:30.\n\nWhen he\u2019s home he insists I get a kid break so he\u2019s downstairs with the kids, and cooking while I go relax and read my book.\n\nWell, I do need a break here and there, but I want a break with my husband. I suggested we get a nanny and he totally flipped out. We have a house cleaner that comes in the morning, some days, I figured why don\u2019t we hire someone in high school or college and she can babysit for a couple hours a night, put them in bed, and take off.\n\nHe got really upset and said he only gets one chance to watch his kids grow up, and he wants to spend every second he can with them. He said one day we\u2019ll have all the time we want to ourselves but now is not the time. All I wanted was maybe an hour a day. He said \u201cthey\u2019re going to remember us reading to them at night and bringing them to bed. That\u2019s a parents job, not some random ass college student\u201d\n\nI guess he\u2019s right but here\u2019s where it\u2019s affecting me. We\u2019re working on a third baby, and we haven\u2019t \u201cworked on it\u201d in weeks. Every time I initiate he says no and says \u201cwhat\u2019s the point? You clearly don\u2019t want to be a mom\u201d\n\nI just think he\u2019s over-reacting a little bit. Of course I want another baby, we always agreed on 4 in total.
