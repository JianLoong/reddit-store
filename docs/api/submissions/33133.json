I think that it is amazing and I am very proud of her. I believe that I was very supportive - participated in beta reading, had my hand in text editing (Edit2: I did some changes in every single page; a lot of suggestions/editing; I do not want to undermine what she did but I really did spend a lot of time on this) and gave her a bunch of praise and critique. We celebrated when she sold the book to the publisher and all, so I don't believe that I was unsupportive. However, she got very angry today because I refused to buy a physical copy of the book. I said that I just don't get this. We live together. What? Her argument is: we live in a small country and every copy sold matters and I should show support. I replied that the readers should buy her book not her partner. Anyhooo... AITA?\n\nEDIT: Thank you good people of Reddit! I guess I am an asshole and a fool. Will try to be better.

Personally I would buy my partners book and get the very first personally signed copy to keep and proudly show it off but you do you. \nWill it break the bank to show her support? Will it hurt you to buy it? \n\nIt's a pretty big deal to get signed with a publisher. Congrats to your girlfriend, I wish her all the success.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s a gesture of support, she doesn\u2019t care if you never read it again. She only cares that you believe in her enough to buy a copy.\n\nThere\u2019s no point in giving someone flowers either as they just die after a couple days. It\u2019s about the gesture and what it means to the person you bought them for.\n\nIf I were you I\u2019d be buying copies for friends and family to show my support, but that\u2019s just me.", "YTA\n\nAs an author, I would advise you to buy her book. \n\nSigning on with a publisher is huge. Getting your first book printed is huge. \n\nHaving your SO refuse to buy it is hugely disappointing. \n\nYou think you've been supportive, but not buying the book makes it seem like all your previous efforts were just for show. Like smiling and playing happy to indulge a toddler who handed you scribbled \"picture\". \n\nIt's unlikely that buying the book will break your bank, so why are you so reluctant? Seems like a weird hill to die on, and planting your flag in it is probably incredibly insulting for her.", "YTA\n\nI have a friend who is published. They write gay romance fantasy, and I don't particularly enjoy the genre.(Nothing wrong with them, it's just not my primary interest). I **still** buy a physical copy of each of their books. I think it's amazing that they are pursuing thier dreams and I know often it's very hard. \n\nHonestly, she shouldn't have had to ask you, it's a basic kind of support, and it would have felt really validating and good for her, all for the inexpensive cost of one book. Now, no matter what you do, she's got the bad taste of having had to try to convince you.\n\nOne day, she'll tell the man she ends up with about how awful this felt and give it as an example of how she realized what a bad choice you were.", "YTA. Definitely. \n\nThis is almost certainly not about \"we live in a small country and every copy sold matters.\" That is probably just her trying to appeal to your rational nature . .  since you *clearly* have no sentimental side!\n\nThis is her *first published book*!!! This has probably been a lifelong dream of hers!! She probably wants you to *show* that you are proud of her, not just *tell* her that. \n\nIn your shoes, I would have rushed out to purchase a physical copy from a local book store, raved about \"how eager I've been to read this book I heard so much about\" to the bookseller as I'm paying, then asked my girlfriend to sign my copy with a personal inscription. Then I would have purchased a [bookstand](https://www.google.com/search?q=bookstand&tbm=isch) -- or, heck, if I had the tools I would have *made* a simple bookstand by hand -- so I could prominently display my personalized, signed copy of the first published book of the woman I love in the home we share. \n\nYou know: *celebrate* her and the fulfillment of her goal.\n\nBesides, you'll want that signed copy to remember her by when she dumps your dull, unimaginative ass!", "YTA- what\u2019s wrong with you? \n\n\nAs someone who has been married for a long time let me let you in on a little secret that seems to elude the masses here:\n\nJust do the little bullshit.  Imagine a world where you said \u201cok\u201d and clicked \u201cbuy it now.\u201d  But no, instead you decided to make it an argument including spending time asking complete strangers to validate your asinine behavior.\n\n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t you have been like \u201cof course but only if the author signs it!\u201d  Right or wrong you would have made someone you like (love?) happy and it would have cost you very little.\n\n\nI swear to god the number of posts that are like \u201cmy SO of 8 years says that Penne is superior to Spaghetti and after a 5 hour fight and the cops showing up I\u2019m writing this from my sister\u2019s house where I\u2019m currently staying.

Then you have  romantic dinner and get lucky. \n\nInstead you're acting like supporting her / relationship stuff, is a chore. Of course she will be disappointed.  \n\nBuying a copy of her book isn't even a grand gesture.  Buying a case so you can give a copy to everyone you know as a gift is a grand gesture.", "If my partner published a book. I would buy a copy.

I\u2019d have to say YTA.", "YTA. You're making a big deal for $15.   Buy the book and ask her to sign it like a real friend would do.", "YTA - just buy a copy. If my wife wrote a book, I\u2019d buy a copy.", "Eh, yah, I'm going to say YTA.\n\nIf I had a partner, family member, friend - doesn't matter - that published their *first* book, I'd buy a copy in support of them because that just seems like the right thing to do.", "YTA\n\nThe book is the materialization of everything she has worked on recently (with your help, of course). Plus, it's probably not that expensive for you and would make a huge impact for her.", "YTA. Of course you should buy her book. How is this a discussion?", "This can\u2019t really be about buying a book. It\u2019s not even logical. Why on earth would you dig your heels in over this, a very simple gesture, of all things? It\u2019s such a small ask that is very important to her. You\u2019re sending the message that what\u2019s important to her doesn\u2019t matter to you unless it\u2019s also important to you. That ain\u2019t love. And that makes your previous help with the book look like you regarded it as a chore. \u201cThat\u2019s it, I\u2019ve helped you enough.\u201d Yuck.", "I  suspect a lot of the people who are voting Y T A don't have family members who have published books or who write a lot.\n\nHaving a beta reader and text editor and someone to talk to about your work is so valuable.

Your girlfriend spent countless hours on this book and I think you did well along the way supporting her but it feels like a let down to just refuse to buy the finished product. I\u2019m guessing she feels like she finally made it and can finally breathe a little and she wanted to share that with you but you said no by not buying the book. \n\nI also think that you should show her how proud you are of her and her success by buying the book and displaying it in your home. If my partner wrote a book, I would want to be the first in line to own it, get it signed, show it off, etc.", "I would buy as many copies as I could and give them out to people I knew so yes you are the AH", "YTA show your support and proudly buy her book. Have her sign it.", "YTA. My buddy self published a kids book and I bought a signed copy for my kids and then multiple copies for clients when they have a baby.", "YTA. An acquaintance from high school I haven\u2019t spoken to in 12 years wrote a book of poetry which is not really my thing and I bought a copy because I\u2019m happy for them.", "Yes. YTA. You absolutely should have Bought the Book. Asked her to sign it. Celebrated publication day with champagne. How is this even an argument? \n\nI have a modest podcast that my husband doesn't listen to and it hurts my feelings because every download counts and it is 25 minutes every other week.", "Yes YTA, you obviously gotta buy one. Comeon dude.", "Just buy the damn book. Jeez. You should have got it on preorder. YTA", "YTA.\n\nYes, you made the effort to support your partner, but you should still be willing to buy a copy of their book and buy copies for any friends or relatives that you think might enjoy it and not just expect to get it for free.\n\nWhen I was in a Gilbert and Sullivan musical many years ago, we had one cast member whose mother spent many hours helping alter costumes to fit, and do makeup and hair, and make sure everyone was where they needed to be.\n\nOn a couple of nights when she wasn't needed, she still paid to get in to see the show and she didn't just ask for a free ticket. She certainly helped a ton, and she helped a lot more than a lot of the other parents and family members and friends of cast members did, and she took a huge weight off our permanent wardrobe lady who had health problems, so she could have taken the view of, \"Well, I helped them so they owe me.\" But instead, she chose to help out and paid to get in anyway because she wanted to support the group.", "My GF wrote a book a few years back. Of course I bought it, it was super exciting to see her name in print and on the order.(of course she would have given me one, but this was better)", "NTA. My wife also bought a book out this year, I helped with editing but she doesn't expect me to buy a copy.\nMaybe you could buy a copy and give it to someone? But like others say, you shouldn't 'have' to.", "I think it depends. Honestly, I can't imagine going out and buying a copy of my husband's book. It would essentially be like him going out and buying the book as we share all our money.", "NTA\nhear me out. I'm a musician and play in a band. We just released our new EP a month ago. It was really hard work recording and publishing it, because we did everything on our selfs. I never would force anyone to buy our music, because i think that noone should buy our music or merch if they doesn't enjoy it. My partner hadn't asked for a copy until now, even though she really enjoys our work and visits nearly all of our concerts. But if she would ask, i'd gift her signed copy anyway. So definetley NTA", "Definitely NTA. She should have confidence in her book enough so that she does not need to put pressure on 'insiders', as it were, to buy it. Source: me, a book editor and proofreader for years.", "I'm against the grain on this apparently. I vote NTA. You were more than supportive during the process (more than most people get in regards to their work). I like to design things. If I had a company sign me on to design a product, I wouldn't expect my partner to buy one just because. And I certainly wouldn't expect them to buy a dozen to hand out to people like people are suggesting you should do. If they really want to more power to them, but it wouldn't even cross my mind to expect that let alone get angry with them for not doing it.", "NTA. She should give you a physical copy if anything.", "NTA. I've published two books. I'd find it wierd if my beta readers bought my book. They have read it already, so why buy a copy of it? That's unnecessary. I'd also never be upset at them for not buying it. If anything I'd buy the book and gift it to them to show I'm grateful for their effort in beta reading it if they showed interested and wanted to have a copy.", "YTA. It's a gesture of support to buy it. My mum wrote and published a book. I bought the first copy. I don't even like the book, I just wanted to support her.", "YTA. It doesn't hurt you in a little bit to buy 1 copy and ask her to sign it for you. It shows support and that you want to have one piece of this for future. On the other hand if not even her partner is willing to buy a copy of the book, what does it say for strangers? You are crushing her confidence.", "YTA - Buy the book and get her to sign it, it\u2019s the thought behind the gesture that matters. She wants you show that you feel proud of her and the book", "Just buy the fucking book, seriously", "Buying a copy and having her sign it seems like a very nice gesture. My buddy just got published. I had him sign a copy. He was touched.", "Okay, so I'll put myself into a position if I was the one publishing the book - and I would love to gift my partner a signed copy as a sign of appreciation. And for people saying \"it's just one book, why shouldn't he buy it\" - same can be said about her gifting him one.\n\nI'm going with NTA on this one.", "She didn't just give you one? Maybe I'm the only NTA, but I would just automatically give one to my spouse. I mean, if she does the same thing in music, do you have to get a ticket or does she just let you into the concert for free?", "NTA:  She should give you a signed copy as a present for your contribution.  Buying something that your partner makes to 'support them' is just weird.", "This does not seem like a hill which is worth dying on. Buy the book. Not something to be stubborn about\n\nBuy the book, ask her to sign it \n\nYTA", "My wife didn't buy my book when it was published....I gave her a copy. I don't need my wife to buy my book, we have a shared bank account so it's my money anyway lol", "NTA. As an author myself, I always give the first signed copies to the people that helped me in the process of writing the book. I would never expect the people that gave time and energy to my project to then turn around and buy it.", "Downvotes Incomming - NTA.\n\n1) publishers provide the author with advance copies for friends, family, and promotions. She just has to specify it.\n\n2) the royalty on this would be, 10% - 15% hardcover, and 5% - 7.5% paperback.\n\n3) NYT best seller list is rigged, all those books come from specific \u2018sales\u2019 that is wholesale purchases made by specific companies that commonly get either kick backs or returned or guaranteed purchase by the publisher, so that doesn\u2019t matter either.\n\n4) if she was genuinely worried about advertising, she would make a Tik tok or other media campaign to get people interested - host an authors reading, whatever.\n\n5) is she going to buy her own book to help with sales? Maybe one for personal experience, but it isn\u2019t going to make a lick of difference in the grand scheme because every sale doesn\u2019t matter.\n\n6) this isn\u2019t book related but her actions reveal, (in my opinion) that she is using/looks at you as an accessory, someone to do her bidding but with minimal self-value. There will come a time, if there hasn\u2019t already where she expects you to do heavy lifting without contributing herself.\n\nI am/was a published author, I write for self fulfillment, not sales. You should never try to use guilt to control someone else\u2019s actions, and that\u2019s all I see.\n\nI hope you can learn & grow from this experience, best of luck.", "Nay... Contentious maybe.\n\nYou supported her in other ways. She shouldn't expect you to buy her book and rage when you choose not to. Personally I feel that good books will eventually generate self sustainable sales, and to expect loved ones to support you by buying the book with no intention of reading it, goes against my views on what books are meant for. I hate for books to be neglected on shelves and create unnecessary carbon footprint that never fulfil its intended purpose to be read.\n\nOn the other hand, you can see this as a gesture of support, owning the first edition of a labour of love from your gf may be meaningful too? It is especially sweet when people support their loved ones even though the chosen actions seem impractical.\n\nI remember this anecdotal account about how a few Chinese friends supported their Tamil-speaking friend at a Tamil debate competition. They didn't understand the language but turned up and sat through the whole competition cheering and waving placards. Impractical? Yes because they don't understand what was going on. But was it important to their Tamil speaking friend who needed the support? Definitely.\n\nSometimes supportive gestures are not necessarily rational. Just compassionate.", "NTA. You were there through the entire process. Now she wants you to buy the book. I actually think she should give you the 1st copy, signed and autographed, thanking you for your support and encouragement on this major accomplishment.", "YTA. Why do you object to buying her book? It would mean the world to her. Her first published book is an incredible achievement.", "YTA", "YTA....is the cost of the book going to break your bank account? I don't get your logic.", "YTA personally if my partner had a book published I'd want to buy that first copy and display it. Curious to why you don't want to? What's holding you back?", "YES. \ud83e\udd28", "NTA, you're under no pretense or obligation to buy her book. You've supported her and been there more for the real support, if you like the book then buy it etc otherwise don't force yourself to. Everyone saying YTA is not someone you want to listen to.", "As someone who has published 2 books, NAH. I would never expect my partner to spend money on books I\u2019ve gotten several free copies of. I can see her point as well though about each purchase mattering, it\u2019s just not something I would put on my partner. We already have the book, he doesn\u2019t need to buy it.", "Yta. Buy the book. Buy 10 and give them away.", "YTA. You need, not only to buy it for yourself, but you need to empty a shelf to give as gift!", "NTA, All I need to know was that you live together. The author gets copies sent to them by the publisher. Usually more than they know what to do with. Why do you need to spend household money on another copy? If you didn't live together, I'd say maybe buy it and leave it out where she could see it when she comes over.", "NTA\n\nIf I wrote a book I'd give my SO a signed book free of charge.", "I'm surprised she didn't give you a copy as a thank you for all the help you gave her.", "You definitely are not. Everything is based on merit, if she cant sell books, she needs a new job", "NTA I would gift my loved ones copies of my books.", "Imo NTA, you didn\u2019t write it but you helped her along the way. You buying the book doesn\u2019t change either of your finances so it isn\u2019t about money. She has a copy of the book in home right?", "NTA. If I wrote a book I might gift a copy to my loved ones but I wouldn\u2019t demand they all go buy it to boost the sales. If the only sales she can get are the ones she demands from family and friends then that\u2019s not great. You supported her writing it and have already read it.", "NTA. \n\nNone of the authors I know are entitled enough to automatically expect their partners, friends or relatives to buy a copy of their book. \n\nOnly buy the book if you are interested in the plotline/genre or plan to gift a copy to someone who is.", "I'm going to break with the pack and say NTA. I write, and my ex wrote and self-published several books. He had many copies so why would I have bought one (more)? \n\nIn terms of buying them and giving them to people, I think deciding what books to read is incredibly personal and when someone gives me a book, it feels like work. Also, in my ex's case, the book wasn't everyone's cup of tea and honestly wasn't that great. \n\nI can totally see feeling like you already gave it your all. Editing someone else's work is a lot. Did you get any payment or credit for helping out? My guess is no. You're fine.", "NTA, I'm so surprised seeing all these people say you are TA.\n\nI myself am a creative person, I write, play music and I draw but just because I do those things it doesn't  mean my SO should buy or listen to any of it.\n\nYes it means a fuck ton for (especially) new authors that other people buy your book, but you being a writer doesn't mean that your SO likes reading, likes having physical books or plainly that it's their taste in books.\n\nThis person helped review and correct mistakes, thats already huge, they didn't have to.\n\nI think people need to grow up and stop calling others assholes for not supporting you the way you want them to.", "NTA. You literally supported her in all the areas where it counts. Proof reading, editing and offering core insight during the toughest process of becoming an author. \n\nHer being angry and focusing on the fact you have not bought the book is dismissive of your efforts and help so far, and is quite self centered  as the focus should not be whether you bought the final product but the fact you went out of your way to help in the process which is where it counts. Imo shows selfishness and a lack of appreciation which is a clear red flag! You should be gifted a book with a personalised message thanking you for everything you have done!\n\nImagine someone asking you to help them prepare and set up their event\u2026then tell you\u2026you have buy a ticket\u2026and be upset if you dont come.", "If you live together, what difference would it make financially if you did or didn't buy the book? Do you share finances? Because if \"every copy sold\" matters to her for financial reasons, I'm confused how your money in particular would benefit her if it's coming out of and then going back into household funds.\n\nAlso, I'm not sure what country you live in, but where I am, I have a local friend who's a published author, and she is given a couple copies of all her publishings to give to family and close friends. Is your girlfriend's publisher the same way?", "\nAs someone who\u2019s been writing since they were 9 y/o, that is an incredible accomplishment. Congrats! However, the boyfriend is NTA here imo. I say this because you can show support in many ways and he has detailed many ways he\u2019s shown support throughout. Does the support stop now that her first book is done? No, of course not. However, there is no requirement to buy a book. The few sales made in the small country wouldn\u2019t matter. She should take it upon herself, if she truly cares this much, to advertise it. Loads of authors advertise their work on tiktok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, etc. network. Social media exists for a reason. \n\nThe purpose of buying a book is to read it. My husband supports and encourages my writing to great lengths. If I was published, I would not be angry at all if he didn\u2019t buy a book. I\u2019d give him a free copy with something personal written inside. And he can do with it what he chooses. \n\nHowever, the money he would\u2019ve spent on books. Whether for himself or for family/friends like I\u2019ve seen people say, that money could go towards something more necessary for us that is far more useful than something that would sit on a shelf when I\u2019d be getting free books anyway. I look at this logically. That\u2019s more practical. She\u2019s reacting with emotion instead of with logic. He isn\u2019t putting her down or belittling her hard work or talent by not buying a book. The act of not doing so doesn\u2019t invalidate all of the support he\u2019s shown up until the point here and now. Sometimes you have to look at things objectively. Sorry, but firmly, NTA.", "This is a tough one. As an author, I have given free copies of my books to the people I love as a way of thanking them for their support. \n\nI would have felt an asshole otherwise. \n\nSo, no. You are not the asshole... But you might want to ask yourself why you didn't see it was going to be a big issue for her.", "I'm going to go the other way no your not the arse hole you supported her through the writing of the book etc most people have a dedication on their book but now she got published the help you gave doesn't matter. I'm sure there were moments she felt like giving up and you was there cheering her on if it was me I would sign a copy that I get to gift from the publisher as a thank you", "If my partner published a book, I would make sure to be the very first to buy a copy, to show my support! That's what one does. YTA.", "Let's imagine that your partner landed a big acting role in a play.\n\n\"Honey, are you going to come see my performance?\"\n\n\"Why?\" you respond.  \"I helped you run your lines.  Isn't that enough?  Normal theatre patrons should see the show, not your partner.\"\n\nYTA", "NTA\n\nYou supported her while she wrote it. You helped edit it. You proofed it. \n\nShe has plenty of gift copies. She couldn\u2019t give you one and write something grateful inside the front cover? Instead you need to buy a copy?!?\n\nRed flags abound.", "YTA. I don't get your reasoning, actually. Why shouldn't her partner buy her book? \n\nYou've been supportive and that's great. But refusing to buy a physical book for no real reason at all must be quite confusing for her, and I believe hurtful.", "NTA.\n\nI have bought friends' books as a show of support. I would not feel the same way about a partner, where I invested my time and energy in their project leading up to publication. \n\nWould it be a nice gesture to buy the book? Yes, absolutely. Should your GF feel like you let her down here? No, not the way you describe it. I think editing, thoughtful criticism, treating her to a celebration dinner, etc. are a valuable demonstration of support. \n\nI am a woman who has supported a male artistic partner (though not a writer) in his endeavors. I would have been unhappy if my partner had decided to pick a fight because I didn't make a small purchase to support his work, overlooking my other contributions. It might feel ungrateful.", "I disagree with most comments. You are not the ass hole. You don't owe a symbolic buying of the books. It sounds like you were with her every step of the way, and it sounds like she should have gifted you a copy to show her thanks for your support. My girlfriends best friend gifted her a copy of his book to thank her for all her help editing it.", "Nta. Why should you buy it?  How tf is you buying 1 copy of a book you already read  support? \n\nLike ffs doe people here not know how business works?", "NTA. She should give you a free copy for the time you put into helping her write it.", "YTA to me its a pride thing, I'd want to have a physical copy of something my partner put her heart and soul into.

It was the least I could do to support a friend.", "He\u2019s a lost cause.", "I wouldnt let my gf spend money on a tickets if I could get her there for free. She shows support by showing up and cheering for me, not by paying for tickets, what? For the price of a ticket you could have bought him small gift to give him after the show as a congratulations to show even more support but whatever..", ">If the only sales she can get are the ones she demands from family and friends then that\u2019s not great.\n\n100%. Guilt tripping your inner circle to support your art does not work at all to build a sustainable career.", "Musician here, can confirm that friends and family get comp tickets. I'd feel like an AH demanding that the people whose love and support plays a huge part in my career even existing also pay for the privilege of seeing me perform.", ">Would it be a nice gesture to buy the book? Yes, absolutely. Should your GF feel like you let her down here? No, not the way you describe it. I think editing, thoughtful criticism, treating her to a celebration dinner, etc. are a valuable demonstration of support.\n\nThis is what I wish more people on here would get. Nobody would deny that it'd be a nice gesture if he did it on his own accord, but it hardly makes him the AH that she finds it appropriate to demand it and pick a fight over it.", "Slightly different but my mum is a book illustrator and the house is full of copies of her books that get sent from the publishers. She would have thought I was crazy if I bought another one \ud83d\ude02", "Had to scroll so far down to find a NTA! To me, buying a book signifies that you are not particularly close to someone but still want to support them by buying their book.\nFor example like I did for a friend who recently wrote a book. We were friends in college but are not close now any more but I still want to support her. \n\n But if you are close and contributed (for example like I did with some friends dissertations) you expect to be given a copy since a limited amount of them are usually free authors copies anyway.", "Can't believe how far I scrolled to see this answer.  This is basic common sense.  Can't believe the majority believe the opposite.", "I understand where you're coming from as a seasoned author. I do not believe this is the same. \n\nRegardless of customary book publishing etiquette, after OP's live-in girlfriend expressed concern every sale counts for her first book, that's a call to action that should be accepted by any live-in partner. Unless maybe the book costs more than flowers.\n\nOh but still NTA. Just missed opportunity", "Had to scroll unreasonably far to find a nta comment . Idk why its so many yta votes frl", "Agreed. Plus, wouldn't it just be their money anyways.. weird situation all around", "I'm married to a published (technical) author and if we did this we'd be losing money actually, as a big percentage goes to the publisher. I don't understand all these YTA comments", "This is how I do with my CDs as well. I don't need my partner to buy a copy to show his support, he shows it every day by helping me with my music. Giving him the CD is actually *me* thanking *him* for the support.", "Yes !", "NTA. Same thing can be said about her. Why couldn't she just gift him a signed copy after all the work he put in to support her?", "Buying is when it counts? Not editing, proofreading, encouraging etc? Buying is the only true metric of support?", "There you go! What a nice idea. You could donate a copy to a library too.", "JFC. My dad is an author.  If he whined I purchase one? I\u2019d ducking throw one at him. \n\nWhy? Because I\u2019ve read that goddam thing so many times. Family and friends read, help edit, revise and re-read dozens of times. But you love and support them.\n\nIf he put in as much as I did HE deserves a free copy and her thanks.", "Yes, an author gets a certain number of copies for free. I don't think it's so much about owning the book, I think it's much more the act of seeing people - especially the people she loves - actually buy the book. \n\nAnd she's not wrong. If she's from a small language, then literally every book sold really does count.", "I\u2019d have bought a few dozen copies and given them to all of my family and friends. What\u2019s with this guy?", "Or: you could do both?", "That is some fantastic fanfiction you just wrote", "Yup I know. My mates a painter and when she first started all her family and friends bought her stuff. They were the only ones sustaining her living until someone finally hit it home she needed a real job. Not to say that this persons book isn\u2019t good it might be fantastic but if it is then I\u2019m sure she won\u2019t need his purchase", "And let's not forget that OP had a direct hand in the book's creation, what with his proofreading and extensive editing. All the YTA voters are so hung up on OP not wanting to buy a book after he's already done so much to help it get published in the first place, why aren't they asking why his wife didn't gift him a copy to thank him for his help?", "Bc they have no clue how the publishing industry works", "I thought that was how it worked as well, it's certainly how I go about my released music and my concerts. There's a reason it's called \"friends and family\" comp/discount/etc.\n\nI am very surprised by the number of YTAs.", "You guys are so fucking extra, honestly.", "What? So we have to ignore the help he gave her because \u201cshe spelled it out\u201d. She\u2019s entitled and ungrateful.", "Ok, so why don\u2019t you want to support her all the way? It\u2019s not hard to buy the finished product. My uncle published a well-received biography when I was a teen. The entire family bought a copy and it proudly sits on my grandparents coffee table to this day. \n\nThis is a strange hill to die on, my friend. What your partner has done is a huge achievement and you should be frankly jumping up and down. Heck, if it were me, I\u2019d be first in line at the signing and putting the book on display.", "If that is hypothetically true then I just hypothetically dumped the hypothetical boyfriend who demands both my free labor and also my money.  Good bye and good luck to him!", "Buying is the complete metric of support. It's like running a race, coming first for most of it, but then stopping just before the finish line. \n\nLike why? What's the point? Why didn't you finish it? And that simple act disqualifies all the other effort you made in the race, you would simply come in last if you don't finish the race, no matter if you were the fastest. So yes finishing the race is the true metric of being first. \n\nIn your case, you provided all this support, all this hard work, and now you're like, okay im done, no more. Just the final step is getting a copy and having it signed by your partner with a personalised message. And yeah the metric is finalised when you go all the way.", "Wow YTA saying a case of social unawareness makes them unworthy of a relationship? Oh wow you edited it out, I guess that makes you a saint and not an AH? Weird you don't apply the same logic to him. \"he should have known\" cry more. How single are you lol, the dudes oblivious, that's it, and you're jumping up and down like a child. Nobody is perfect and he's literally asking people if he's in the wrong and taking the advice? Get off the internet and play outside or something damn, some people are just like that. \"Become better\"", "YTA for saying she should find a better partner. You don\u2019t know anything about their relationship other than the super small amount this dude told you. Sure, should he have bought at least one copy? I would have for sure. But bro could be perfect in every other way. You saying for her to find someone better based on this misread/mistake is some ultra child-like entitlement behavior.", "Dunno. Honestly. I helped her and I thought that shows I care. Because, you know? Actual help. I thought that I am thinking rationally. Now I can see that I am wrong. So... If I did no beta reading and no editing and no extra effort whatsoever and just bought her book that would be better? I don't get it.:(", "[deleted]", "I agree that he should buy at least one copy. However, if he was actually as involved with providing her background assistance i proofreading, etc, I would think that she should have taken the first or second copy of the book and written within the book her gratitude and presented to him as a token of her appreciation.  He can buy and distribute additional copies to family and friends .in the end, I think they're both off base.", "Literally this! I\u2019m a writer. My sister does all the stuff OP did (and more). And she buys EVERY. SINGLE. BOOK. Like I think she has more than me at this point. My mother is going to buy a bunch from me directly (I self pub) so she can leave them in the cruise ship library on our next holiday. Like\u2026that\u2019s support", "Another one....I love you all.....\n\nSo, let's say you are right.\nBy probability \n\n>But bro could be perfect in every other way.\n\nAlso, by probability, the bro could be doing the opposite of being supportive at other times and the gf could have been oblivious.\n\nDecision is not to be made, in my both original and edited comment... I used a next sentence, starting with 'if'.\nCheck the edit history if you have the means. \nSo, I was giving the benefit of doubt to have both probabilities. Now normal people understand my comment.\n\nWhereas, some people have to nitpick and pull just one sentence ignoring the context and the next sentence.\nAnd I love these group of people, the very reason I am in reddit is for you all. To add perspective and to educate. \nThank you for participating and helping with my goal to transform and challenge views with respect.\n\nI like how you wrote YTA on me when not OP.

T.H. Forest \ud83e\udd70", "Not at all, mate. You obviously cared enough to beta read and edit and so forth, and kudos for that, however if you hadn\u2019t, would you still have bought the book? \n\nIt just seems like an odd final step to skip out on, that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. And I\u2019m a writer too, FWIW.", "Editing and proofreading is **work**!", "While I think soft YTA experience it for free? Thats free labor lmao he was doing her the favor\u2026", "This is also a lovely idea from the other side.  He should have bought anyway, gifted elsewhere if she did this.", "He's not talking about her getting him copies. \nOne could look at it like your 2nd paragraph but I certainly don't believe he deserved a tantrum because he didn't want to buy a copy.  He assisted and supported her in so many ways prior to publishing that I think he went over and above.  \nI do creative writing/prose.  I read them to hubby and share with my son's but I certainly wouldn't expect them to purchase any copies if anything were ever published.", "I\u2019m writing a book and I already know for a fact my mom won\u2019t be buying a copy. She refuses to even read it, saying if it doesn\u2019t get published it\u2019s not worth reading and won\u2019t talk about it with me. Meanwhile my dad will get a signed copy should it be published.", "Exactly, I'm autistic so sometimes I don't get why neurotypical feel a certain way or why I'm supposed to do something but I do know I want the people I love to feel loved and supported. You can't argue someone out of their feelings and if someone tells you what they need to feel supported and it's something easy to do then why wouldn't you just do it?", "I guess so. I feel very weird right now. It's like I found such a blindspot in my mindset. I don't even know why it is there. So hard to explain.", "I can't imagine having someone provide a bunch of support and feedback during the writing process and then not GIVING them a signed copy as a token of my appreciation as soon a it was published.  Not to say he shouldn't buy a copy,  buy how it did not occur to her to give him one of the first copies?", "Hey, it\u2019s not the end of the world. We all make mistakes.

That\u2019s something to be proud of :)", "Unless she writes something like 50 shades....", "Not sure that signed copies of a book are worth that much unless the author is long dead.", "What a shitty philosophy on life", "YTA I had an essay published in an anthology book. Didn\u2019t really expect anyone to buy it but if I had partner and wanted them to buy it and they didn\u2019t, I would probably end the relationship. Seriously, my mom, a couple of her friends, and like 15 of my friends bought it to show support without me even asking. It felt so good. You\u2019re definitely an asshole.", "As symbolism I would 100% buy it. How can you not?!", "Is this really a hill worth dying on? Just buy the book and put it in your bookshelf.", "His gesture of support was helping her get it published. She\u2019s should be gifting him a copy as thanks.", "So much this. I don't know many writers, but I know sooo many fellow recording artists who go on long diatribes in social media about their friends and family not being supportive enough because they're not going out of their way to listen to their music.\n\nI eventually gave up on the more nuanced takes on why it's ridiculous to expect that just because someone likes you they need to also like your art, so now I just make this comment: show me one successful artist for whom a main driver of their success was badgering friends and family to promote them. It barely even moves the needle. It's not a sustainable way to grow.", "I was going to make the same comment as #5.  If she wants to increase sales because it's such a small country, she should go buy a few cases of the books herself.", "I had to scroll so long to find someone who agrees \ud83d\ude2d", "Thank you!\n\nThe level of support involved in beta reading and editing absolutely dwarfs purchasing a copy. It's not even close. The OP's likely dumped dozens of hours into this, maybe hundreds.\n\nI think this sub can be forgiven for not comprehending that, but the girlfriend is acting super cringe here. She's got the memory and gratitude of a goldfish.", "It's a discussion because her request is the exact opposite of how most authors operate.  Most authors have the decency to give those who helped out a free autographed copy.  Plus the publisher is going to give her a free case of the books.  They'll have dozens of the books in their apartment.  It's a waste of money to pay the publisher for another copy.", "Yeah this. One of my FB friends is an author. I met him years ago at a football (soccer) game when a few chat forum members met up. I proof read some of his early children's books and happily brought a few copies despite having read them several times. Nowadays he writes adult cosy murder mystery and I bought several copies of them for Xmas presents a few years ago. My daughter absolutely loves them and can't wait for the next one.", "Seriously, a signed and recently published book by my partner would be my go-to present for pretty much everyone!\n\nI'd be so, so proud!", "Yeah, my husband did some beta reading for Edie in early days. Even though I am not the audience for the book type, I adore owning books written by someone I love.", "Sure, it would be nice for OP to buy the book and if I was in his place i probably would. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that it is an unreasonable request to ask someone who helped you publish a book to buy their own copy when you should be the ine gifting them a free copy as a sign of graitutude", "Exactly.  She's the one that started unnecessary drama.  She's going to have boxes of this book given to her by the publisher.  It's idiotic to buy another copy.  Her entitlement and obnoxious behavior seems to be a big red flag.", "It\u2019s not the only metric of support, but it was important to her and that\u2019s what matters. Weird hill to die on.", "no support he read and helped edit it however many times she wrote it. he celebrated when she sold it to the company. for all of his work she should have given him a book as a thank you", "I think it\u2019s because he\u2019s insinuating that he wrote the book because he edited and suggested on every page. How brave of him not to support her and to take so much credit.

So my reaction coming to this post was that the girlfriend could have given op a copy as thanks for being there through this journey.\n\nThen again, that's not the situation. Op's girlfriend is asking op to buy a copy as a show of support, and its clearly meaningful to her for them to do so.", "Sure.  And then he can write a tell-all and thrash her.
