I feel self-conscious eating, feel bad leaving the light on, etc, because I see that someone a few feet away is trying to sleep.

Go about your business as if they weren't there. That alone should stop it. \n\nTime for a group meeting for you to put it all out there and decide what the house rules are.", "If people are sleeping in the common areas just because they prefer it, you don't owe them accommodations (being extra quiet, leaving lights off etc). Go about your business. \n\nYou're paying rent for that shared space. If they want their own room, they can move out or pay a bigger share of the rent for inconveniencing the roommates. \n\nWhose couch is it anyway? If your roommates bed is uncomfortable, they can buy a new one. \n\nEw the entitlement", "If they want privacy and a sleeping environment free of light/sound, they should sleep in their rooms. \n\nStop tiptoeing around the couch sleepers and stop feeling bad about using the common areas, the lights, cooking, eating, etc.  If they sleep in a common area and you wake them up, that's their problem, not yours.", "I think its weird enough that theres 4 of you in a handful of rooms and someone is still bringing a someone to stay the night\n\nWhen its that crowded go to their place\n\nBootie call in a shared bedroom is weird", "Nta. And I wouldn't be especially quiet and \"courteous\" when they are on the couch. Go about your business and what you need to do lights on, dishes rattling etc. Ifvthey wakenup then thats their problem and they can go to their room. You pay a share of the rent too and communal spaces are not for 1 or 2 roomies to commandeer almost every night and depriving the other roomies of fair usage. They have bedrooms. If Emily's bed isn't comfy then she needs to buy a new mattress or topper. Maybe it's time for a roomie meeting to set rules down about couch sleeping. It's one thing to take the occasional nap or night but 3/4 nights a week is ridiculous.", "NTA It's a shared space, you're more than entitled to use that space for It's intended purpose. If they wanna complain about how loud you're being in the kitchen/living room, or the lights being turned on, then feel free to remind them that they have a perfectly good bedroom to sleep in and all their problems would be solved by not sleeping on the couch.", "NTA But politely warn her that if you want to be in the communal living space you are going to be and that she can move to her bed if it bothers her.", "NTA. If they choose to sleep on the couch then they have chosen to be potentially woken up by someone cooking/eating/studying etc. If I were you I'd just go about my business. They probably see it as a nice place to sleep. Make it so it is not so.", "NTA. It\u2019s the common area and no one should have to limit their use of the space/sofa and be extra quiet because someone has made it their second bedroom.", "NTA\nSo Emily and Sarah share a bedroom and neither use it? That just seems strange to me.\n\nCommon places aren't sleeping places. Tell them that at times you need to do homework or other things in that room.  Then do whatever you need to do in the common space. If it awakens them, apologize and continue what you were doing.", "NTA - You all need to sit down and set out some ground rules. I suggest: \n\n\\- the living room/kitchen area is common space and noise should be expected during \"daytime hours\" (e.g. between 7am-10pm or whatever works for your schedules) and if people want a quiet place to sleep, they need to sleep in their bedroom (e.g. no complaining about noise if you are sleeping on the couch during the day)\n\n\\- if someone is sleeping on the couch during \"daytime hours\" (see above), they agree to be woken up if another roommate wants to sit in the living room and both couches are taken\n\n\\- if someone needs to sleep on the couch because their roommate is having a guest over, they get priority but should tell the other roommates in advance (which should be possible, since presumably the other roommate is making everyone aware of their plan for a guest)", "YWNBTA. Just because you all split the cost of the couches, doesn't mean they get to hog them practically every night. Suggest to Emily that perhaps she needs a new mattress or mattress topper for comfort. In the meantime, just go about your late night or early morning business as though they weren't there. If they complain, say, \"I'm sorry for waking you, but you know, this wouldn't happen if you actually slept in your own bed for a change.\" If they push back about discomfort, say, \"Not my problem. I sleep where I'm supposed to.\" I do agree with others who say it's time for a roomie chat and laying down of some ground rules.", "YWNBTA - Maybe suggest she get a foam mattress topper to make her bed more comfortable. The living room should be a shared space that you can all use, not anyone's bedroom. Or, if people are in the living room sleeping, they have to be OK with the fact that someone might be cooking or making noise because it's not their personal room", "NTA. I would talk to them about it. If the frequency does not diminish, then I would stop treating the living room as a place that is quiet/dark. If there is a good reason, like someone has a boyfriend over and privacy is wanted, then fair enough. Otherwise, in my opinion, just act like they aren\u2019t sleeping there. Turn the lights on you need, make your food, tell them that they have a perfectly dark and quiet bedroom to sleep in if you\u2019re bothering them. I wouldn\u2019t suggest you go out of your way to wake them up, but I would suggest that you act like normal for that time because you are using the kitchen and the living room as it\u2019s meant to be used.\n\nOf course, this all depends on what they are like and how hostile this might make your living situation. Definitely talk to them and raise your concerns first, preferably with Jade backing you up. And then decide where it makes sense to escalate from there if that does not go well. Be polite, just raise your concerns about how you cannot get done what you want to get done in the night because they are sleeping in the only place you have available to you.", "NTA she can sleep on the couch if she likes, but also you have a right to do what you need to do in the communal spaces, whether thats cooking or watching tv etc. That's what communal spaces are for, and if it disturbs her then it's her problem and she can use her own bed. I wonder if her bed is so uncomfortable can she maybe get a new one? Or is there another issue with having a shared room that isn't working for her. Long term you guys maybe need to look at how well the accommodation is really working for you all.", "NTA! This is coming from someone who slept on the couch last night for the same reason, I read this while laying on it still lol. I don\u2019t expect anyone to accommodate me when I\u2019m in a shared living space.", "NTA. I reckon let her sleep in the couch and you snuggle her. Hahahah. I can only imagine her shocked reaction to someone lying beside her and maybe she\u2019ll think twice about hogging the couch so much!", "NAH, as long as it's respectfully addressed. \n\nI love being a guy. We'd just get a third couch in that living room, stadium style if need be.", "YWNBTA, but that is just way too many people in way too small of a place in my opinion.

If they've made the choice to sleep in the common area, then that's on them. You don't owe it to them to be particularly quiet. I'm not saying go around banging pots together (you have to be considerate of your neighbours after all), but just make a normal level of noise.

It\u2019s not that weird, she got our permission beforehand and we all know him/were okay with it. I offered to sleep on the couch so they could have the bedroom for the night. Not a big deal.

But Emily sleeps on the couch half the week it feels like, which I feel is excessive for a shared space. Jade and I have only done it a few times this entire year. But yeah, I agree and will probably try to take that advice (thought it will be hard for me not to feel guilty doing it)", "No hostility at all, we all get along pretty well. I just feel a little bad telling someone not to sleep on a couch that they partially own. Also, sometimes I do go about things as normal; I\u2019ll eat if I\u2019m hungry even if someone\u2019s asleep, I just can\u2019t help but feel bad about it.

Gross.", "You wouldn't be doing anything with the intent of being mean. You would be using the area for is typical purpose.  No guilt is needed for cooking in a kitchen.
