Our place is small, it\u2019s just the bedrooms, bathrooms, and the living room/kitchen.

But, when someone is sleeping on the couch all of these things are a bit harder to do since I have to be quieter not to wake them. I feel self-conscious eating, feel bad leaving the light on, etc, because I see that someone a few feet away is trying to sleep. Emily especially sleeps on the couches quite a lot, maybe 3-4 nights a week on average.

Emily and Sarah were both going to sleep on the couch, so I had to ask one of them not to this night alone. Sarah politely agreed. I just feel like this is getting a little ridiculous. It shouldn\u2019t be this regular for people to sleep on the couches in a shared space, and I feel like 3/4 of us should never be vying for a spot on a couch at night when everyone has a bed.\n\nEmily has said she likes sleeping on the couch because it is comfier than her bed, which is why she does it so regularly. However, it\u2019s really annoying to me that I don\u2019t have a proper space to be when Jade is asleep in our bedroom and Emily is sleeping on the living room couch. I feel like I may be stepping out of line asking her not to sleep there because it is everyone\u2019s couch and she has every right to nap wherever in her own home. I also feel bad because it is more comfortable for her. WIBTA if I asked her to please stop sleeping on the couch so often?\n\nEdit: I have no issue with Jade and I am not tiptoeing around her! She let us know in advance that her bf would be visiting and we all approved of it. I offered to sleep on the couch for the night to give her privacy, she did not expect it or kick me out of the room etc. I have no issue doing this for a night since it\u2019s a one-time kind of thing, this is only the second time he\u2019s stayed over ever and she let us know in advance.

You pay a share of the rent too and communal spaces are not for 1 or 2 roomies to commandeer almost every night and depriving the other roomies of fair usage. They have bedrooms.

Then do whatever you need to do in the common space. If it awakens them, apologize and continue what you were doing.", "NTA - You all need to sit down and set out some ground rules. I suggest: \n\n\\- the living room/kitchen area is common space and noise should be expected during \"daytime hours\" (e.g. between 7am-10pm or whatever works for your schedules) and if people want a quiet place to sleep, they need to sleep in their bedroom (e.g. no complaining about noise if you are sleeping on the couch during the day)\n\n\\- if someone is sleeping on the couch during \"daytime hours\" (see above), they agree to be woken up if another roommate wants to sit in the living room and both couches are taken\n\n\\- if someone needs to sleep on the couch because their roommate is having a guest over, they get priority but should tell the other roommates in advance (which should be possible, since presumably the other roommate is making everyone aware of their plan for a guest)", "YWNBTA. Just because you all split the cost of the couches, doesn't mean they get to hog them practically every night. Suggest to Emily that perhaps she needs a new mattress or mattress topper for comfort.

If they complain, say, \"I'm sorry for waking you, but you know, this wouldn't happen if you actually slept in your own bed for a change.\" If they push back about discomfort, say, \"Not my problem. I sleep where I'm supposed to.\" I do agree with others who say it's time for a roomie chat and laying down of some ground rules.", "YWNBTA - Maybe suggest she get a foam mattress topper to make her bed more comfortable. The living room should be a shared space that you can all use, not anyone's bedroom.

I would talk to them about it. If the frequency does not diminish, then I would stop treating the living room as a place that is quiet/dark. If there is a good reason, like someone has a boyfriend over and privacy is wanted, then fair enough. Otherwise, in my opinion, just act like they aren\u2019t sleeping there. Turn the lights on you need, make your food, tell them that they have a perfectly dark and quiet bedroom to sleep in if you\u2019re bothering them. I wouldn\u2019t suggest you go out of your way to wake them up, but I would suggest that you act like normal for that time because you are using the kitchen and the living room as it\u2019s meant to be used.\n\nOf course, this all depends on what they are like and how hostile this might make your living situation. Definitely talk to them and raise your concerns first, preferably with Jade backing you up. And then decide where it makes sense to escalate from there if that does not go well.

I wonder if her bed is so uncomfortable can she maybe get a new one? Or is there another issue with having a shared room that isn't working for her. Long term you guys maybe need to look at how well the accommodation is really working for you all.", "NTA! This is coming from someone who slept on the couch last night for the same reason, I read this while laying on it still lol.

Let your roomies know that you would hate to have to find somewhere else to live because you feel uncomfortable living in your current home, but that to preserve the friendships you are willing to move out if needed.  Hang in there.", "NTA.  Everyone that lives there has a bed, no one should be sleeping on the couch except an occasional guest, or as is the case in the post, a BF is sleeping over and arrangements are made ahead of time.  A nap once in a while is one thing, but sleeping on the couch every night is a bit much", "Personally I prefer the couch. I always have however I wouldn't expect the people who come in to tiptoe around if I have a bedroom and most definitely wouldn't take it if it wasn't my home and had roommates (that weren't my family lol).", "That's a rich person solution", "You must be quite rich to say that.

If it's not your own bed, move around the living room and kitchen as if you pay rent. (Because, you do!)\n\nYou don't need to be a doormat for your roommates, so stop doing all that.

Then when they're in living room you can have your whole personal space available for use. But also definitely worth establishing rules for shared common space use.", "NTA. Common room. Make all the noise you want or need to.", "If they are sleeping on the couch regularly enough, they must assume OP doesn't mind having to be quiet. OP must remain courteous of people sleeping, but should start acting like people aren't sleeping in the common area if they're doing it most of the week. Be as loud as you would be if people are sleeping in their room. Turn on whatever lights you want. Treat the common area as common area. Someone doesn't get to turn the living room into their damn bedroom.", "I\u2019m sorry, for letting it get so far? I don\u2019t think I\u2019m in the wrong for not saying anything about someone sleeping on the couch", "I understand this suggestion but Jade and I mesh really well and Sarah and Emily go well together, so I think we\u2019re currently already sorted in the best way", "You should bother her more.", "Die Harder.
