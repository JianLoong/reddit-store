Fast forward, he lives 3 hours away and whenever he comes into town he asks my fianc\u00e9 if him and his girlfriend and dog can stay at our house. This just happened again and my fianc\u00e9 and I are going to be out of town for the weekend and she still agrees to let him stay in our house while we\u2019re not there which I am not comfortable with (for reference their other brother and parents live right by us but he doesn\u2019t stay there because they would feel uncomfortable too). I know myself I would never ask anyone except my parents if I can stay at their house while they\u2019re not there. I expressed my discomfort to my fianc\u00e9 and she doesn\u2019t care at all.

The problem is less about her brother staying and more about her not caring that you're uncomfortable with the intrusion on your space.", "NTA- your fiance's parents are uncomfortable having them in their house when they are home, and your fiance thinks it's okay to leave them in your house by themselves? Nope.", "NTA.  I would be uncomfortable too. But the more alarming fact is the fact that your fianc\u00e9 doesn't care.", "Not at all an AH, but the fact your fiance doesn't care at all is a major red flag.", "You are not the AH, but with a 6 years relationship i guess you 2 should put the cards on the table and set out some boundaries. Your opinion is important, it's not ok your future wife to not give a fk.", "Info: what is the history of dodgy behaviour? You could either be entirely justified, or a judgy AH. Hard to say!!", "NTA. It's your house and your fianc\u00e9 doesn't have the right to force your to accept this, just as much as you don't have the right to force her to accept anyone in her home too. That's a decision that should be made together as the partners you should be.\n\n>I expressed my discomfort to my fianc\u00e9 and she doesn\u2019t care at all.\n\nThat's a big deal. She doesn't care about how you feel, but you two are supposed to become married?\n\nThat said.\n\nI just want to make sure of something. You said it's ''our house'', you are both owner right? Because if it's her house it become a bit touchy. Still not great that she doesn't care about how you feel or asked you, but ...\n\nIn addition, is there a reason why you don't like that brother. Because you could be totally justify, but it's also possible that you don't like him for a bad reason. Like he is bisexual or he used to do drug 10 years ago and you still use that against him, or you just view him as lesser for ''insert fuck up reason''. It's reddit we see some fuck up shit lol.", "NTA\n\nIt's your house, too.\n\nIf you are uncomfortable about them staying there when you are not home, that should be the end of it.\n\nThere are other places they can stay.\n\nIf your fianc\u00e9 is not willing to respect your wishes, you need to decide whether you want to stay in a relationship where \"the family\" is more important than you are.\n\nGood Luck", "Nta. And let this be a sign. She doesn\u2019t care if you are comfortable or not. So you have a choice. 1. Stay home bc you don\u2019t want her brother in your home alone or 2. Don\u2019t let him stay.

I would not let anyone except my parents and maybe three of my siblings stay in my house without my there.  My fourth sibling, who has definitely done questionable shit in the past?  No way.", "NTA. \n\nIt is perfectly fine to not be okay with people you don't like staying at your house. Your fianc\u00e9 is TA for disregarding your feelings and making the decision without consulting you first.", "If his own family doesn\u2019t feel comfortable with letting him stay, that speaks volumes. And not wanting people in your house when your not home is perfectly fine. Family or not, it\u2019s your prerogative but having a companion who\u2019s not on the same page is a different problem in itself.", "NTA. It's your home.\n\n>their other brother and parents live right by us but he doesn\u2019t stay there because they would feel uncomfortable too\n\nSo why are you expected to accept this if they can't?", "NTA. No one's allowed at my house without my permission, that's a right I pay for.", "NTA. Tell her that since she is just disregarding your feeling, you are wondering if the two of you need a break because a fianc\u00e9 has her partners back FIRST. And she is not doing that.", "I'm leaning towards justified since his in laws are also uncomfortable having them stay there while they're home. If the guy's own parents won't let them stay that speaks volumes.", "I'm probably leaning towards AH just because he didn't answer the question!"]}
