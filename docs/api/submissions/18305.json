This is not a big deal, and even if it was, the right move would have been to come talk to you about it.

Gonna use that.", "\u201cWell I\u2019m not used to noisy neighbours who think it\u2019s okay to take the garbage out after 6pm.\u201d \n\nLMAO!!! Most people I know don't even start taking the garbage out at that time. \n\nI would try to take it out before 11 though. That seems to be a fairly standard start to quiet time hours.", "NTA: curfew isn't at 6pm, you have every right.  He should know better than to make a fuss too, given you are neighbors.", "NTA.  He thinks quiet hours should start at 6 pm ?  He's being ridiculous. \n\nI'm a night owl too.  Too many years of working night shift. That's when I get my best work done.   I still try not to make noise that might be disruptive to my neighbors after 11 pm when most of them are probably sleeping.  So I  don't blast my music like I do if I  clean earlier in the day and if I  didn't bring the trash barrel down before 10, I  set an alarm to get up at 8 or 9 am to bring it down to the curb.  I have more flexibility now that I'm not working. \n\nWhen I worked evenings, I  was often getting home 1-2 am.  That makes some noise.  Not much that I  could do about that.\n\nI think we should all try to be courteous neighbors, but you've got to do what you've got to do.", "NTA - you weren't keeping them awake with your cleaning, the issue was you taking the bin out late? After 6pm?!? What does he expect if people work a late shift? They have to do it before or it's \"too late for them\"? Are they kidding? It's a bin. Unless you have a mile long trek around their house, it probably takes two minutes or less. If that bothers them, then they have issues and need a white noise generator or something like that. \n\nAs far as I'm concerned, you did nothing wrong.", "NTA. How loud can garbage cans really be and how long does it take, 12 seconds?", "Very clear NTA. Neighbor is very much being an AH about this. He should learn to exted a bit of grace to others.", "NTA. The neighbor isn't wrong for calling the police either coz they aren't aware about your schedule. But now that they are aware, They shouldn't complain as long as you aren't being like extremely loud.", "6PM??? \n\nIf they ask you not to take it out after midnight or 22:00 or something, maybe. \n\nMy downstairs neighbour asked me if I could avoid putting on the washing machine so early as I'm an early riser and used to put it on at 6:00 when I got up before I headed out to the gym. Because she asked politely and I previously had no idea she could hear it, I obliged of course. Now I usually put it on when I get back a couple of hours later when I know she's already up for work. \n\nSurely something similar could be discussed here?", "NTA. I get home from work after midnight and put my bins out then your fine.", "NTA\n\nimo, 6pm is not late at night. 9/10pm yeah that\u2019s pretty late, but most places\u20266 is still kinda a bit light out. \n\nNeighbor can shut the heck up", "My neighbor takes his out at 5:30AM and it wakes me up. Do I like it? No. Have I complained? Also no. I assume that's when it fits into his schedule so I roll over and try to go back to sleep. \n\nI take mine out at 8 or 9PM so would be on your neighbor's naughty list, too.", "NAH\n\nYou have the right to put out the bins whenever is best for you. As long as you aren't deliberately making excess noise I don't see what the problem is really, you have to put your bins out somehow.\n\nOn the other hand I do understand that the neighbour probably doesn't enjoy the noise, especially if they get scared thinking that it is someone doing something untoward. \n\nUnfortunately I think it boils down to just being a clash of schedules and it sucks but the neighbour will probably just have to suck it up.", "NTA. if theres not a curfew or HOA rules in place about this, he can get lost. i normally bring mine to the road anywhere from 8pm-11pm i\u2019d laugh in the face of a neighbor if they brought this up. and i sure af don\u2019t roll it in the grass either lol you sound a like a good person trying their hardest!", "Check your local ordinance. On my street, bins can\u2019t go out before 8pm the evening before pickup.

I'm not really quiet about it either since my neighbors like letting their dogs wander, and they have a thing for trying to sneak up in you at night.\n\nAs an insomnia sufferer myself, I get the hard start issue. Hope the little one grows out of it.", "NTA and im petty so next time I took out the trash i would be knocking everything over like a Chris Farley scene.", "NAH, but I'm a mom with two little kids as well and taking out the trash isnt something that can't be done through the day. It wont do any good for you and your kids if you have bad bloody between the neighbours.", "NTA your neighbors can\u2019t patrol what time of day you clean.", "Your neighbor should be prosecuted for making frivolous police calls", "NTA. \n\nYour neighbour acting like some kinda garbage bin police \ud83e\udd23 my neighbour takes her garbage out at 3-4am, I have never been woken up by it. \n\nAssuming you\u2019re not banging pans in your backyard/lane, your neighbour needs to take the stick out of his rear end and move on.", "NTA, some neighbors would offer to roll it out for you.", "NTA there's no time limit on taking out the trash, and even if there was, it certainly wouldn't be 6pm. Tell your neighbor to stuff it.", "NTA, we take our garbage out at like 2 am sometimes, who cares???", "Six (6) PM? That's absolutely bonkers. NTA", "NTA. Is your neighbor REALLY upset that you take the trash bins out late at night? Or is he judging you for being a single parent and this is an easy thing to complain about? Does the other neighbor actually have a problem, or is this guy the neighborhood pot stirrer? Either way, you're not throwing loud parties or rehearsing a mariachi band under his bedroom window, and he's just going to have to deal with the minor inconvenience of hearing your bin wheels occasionally.", "I live in a development with mostly older people. Some put bins out early (earlier than we're allowed, technically), but several of us put them out 6-11pm. There are a lot of people close by, so yeah, it can be noisy for a couple minutes. Not a big deal to me, but I try to get it done by 10 or 11pm. NTA, but it sounds like the 3am noise scared your neighbor, so I would aim for 10-11 from now on. You are doing amazing, and I love \"tornadoes.\"", "NTA- The neighbor probably isn't mad at you, but himself. He thought he was being the neighborhood hero, and discovered he was just a paranoid old man who called the cops on a single mother of two just trying to take out the trash. I bet he's just embarrassed and taking it out on you. It could have easily been a raccoon he called the cops on, that's probably why the cops didn't bother to show up. \n\nIf you want to keep the peace and save his ego, you don't have to do this and I wouldn't blame you for it, tell him you're sorry, but glad he's looking out for you, and the community. Maybe it was late and you were a bit frazzled doing all this on your own, and may not have noticed the amount of noise you were making.    Of COURSE he called the cops, what good neighbor WOULDN'T! You're new, in this situation, and should have known better. Next time, he knows it's you, and shouldn't be concerned about it. Here's some homemade cookies. Get store bought, put them in the nuker for 10 seconds, and put them on a plate, they won't be able to tell the difference. I suggest chocolate chip.\n\nIf you want to be a dick, and I fully support this, tell that old busy body old man to save his energy for yelling at the neighborhood kids to get off his lawn and to stop worrying what a grown woman is doing on her own property. To, instead of tiring his fingers calling the cops, use them on his clearly unsatisfied wife. If he says she's dead, ask if it was suicide.\n\nI'd choose 1. You could get free lawn care for a while if he feels bad enough.", "NTA. If he's bothered by your cleaning hours he can offer to take your trash outside earlier. People have no empathy for mothers, they think we're supposed to handle everything in a way that pleases everyone not caring if this is something actually possible", "YTA your neighbor is wrong- the 6pm deadline is ridiculous- but rolling the garbage to the curb at 11pm, and especially 3am, is AH territory. Those are designated quiet hours in most places. At that point you should just wait a few hours until morning.", "NTA to take bins out after 6pm; YTA to do it at 11pm or even 3am. That's absurd. \n\nPrioritise the chores that could upset neighbours above quiet ones that's won't.", "Tough situation. I get your point of view. I also have a real problem with noise. I know it\u2019s more convenient for you to take the trash out late, but you do need to be considerate of your neighbors. Maybe just put the bags in the alley and wait until morning to put them in the cans. So YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
