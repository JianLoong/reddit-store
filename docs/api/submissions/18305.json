Some put bins out early (earlier than we're allowed, technically), but several of us put them out 6-11pm. There are a lot of people close by, so yeah, it can be noisy for a couple minutes. Not a big deal to me, but I try to get it done by 10 or 11pm. NTA, but it sounds like the 3am noise scared your neighbor, so I would aim for 10-11 from now on. You are doing amazing, and I love \"tornadoes.\"", "NTA- The neighbor probably isn't mad at you, but himself. He thought he was being the neighborhood hero, and discovered he was just a paranoid old man who called the cops on a single mother of two just trying to take out the trash. I bet he's just embarrassed and taking it out on you. It could have easily been a raccoon he called the cops on, that's probably why the cops didn't bother to show up. \n\nIf you want to keep the peace and save his ego, you don't have to do this and I wouldn't blame you for it, tell him you're sorry, but glad he's looking out for you, and the community. Maybe it was late and you were a bit frazzled doing all this on your own, and may not have noticed the amount of noise you were making.    Of COURSE he called the cops, what good neighbor WOULDN'T! You're new, in this situation, and should have known better. Next time, he knows it's you, and shouldn't be concerned about it. Here's some homemade cookies. Get store bought, put them in the nuker for 10 seconds, and put them on a plate, they won't be able to tell the difference. I suggest chocolate chip.\n\nIf you want to be a dick, and I fully support this, tell that old busy body old man to save his energy for yelling at the neighborhood kids to get off his lawn and to stop worrying what a grown woman is doing on her own property. To, instead of tiring his fingers calling the cops, use them on his clearly unsatisfied wife. If he says she's dead, ask if it was suicide.\n\nI'd choose 1. You could get free lawn care for a while if he feels bad enough.", "NTA. If he's bothered by your cleaning hours he can offer to take your trash outside earlier. People have no empathy for mothers, they think we're supposed to handle everything in a way that pleases everyone not caring if this is something actually possible", "YTA your neighbor is wrong- the 6pm deadline is ridiculous- but rolling the garbage to the curb at 11pm, and especially 3am, is AH territory. Those are designated quiet hours in most places. At that point you should just wait a few hours until morning.", "NTA to take bins out after 6pm; YTA to do it at 11pm or even 3am. That's absurd. \n\nPrioritise the chores that could upset neighbours above quiet ones that's won't.", "Tough situation. I get your point of view. I also have a real problem with noise. I know it\u2019s more convenient for you to take the trash out late, but you do need to be considerate of your neighbors. Maybe just put the bags in the alley and wait until morning to put them in the cans. So YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
