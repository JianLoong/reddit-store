I would go crazy if I had to nag my husband like this, very few people love doing chores around the house, but they still need doing, and they become way more miserable if one person has to constantly remind the other to do stuff. Add to that the situation with your surgery, where you literally can't do it, and he's just being lazy af.\n\nLike, sure, I can understand why he would be annoyed at being nagged, but it's his own damn fault. If I say I'm going to do something I don't particularly want to do and I keep putting it off and having to be reminded, I'm going to be annoyed, but the solution to that is just doing it, not getting mad.\n\nEdit: And you only asked him once per day? That's not even nagging, that's reminding him to do something he said he would do, at a perfectly reasonable interval.", "NTA. \n\nSounds like your husband is angry at the consequences of his own actions. Whilst you do a long list of medically approved tasks, taking far longer than running a vacuum, he is perturbed that you lacked the desire to snuggle with an overgrown self-made toddler that cannot remember a task without being reminded multiple times. \n\nSuggestion, as he seems like the type that uses deflection as an excuse: he will argue back that he always intended to do it, and pass blame back to you for \u201cfrustrating him by nagging\u201d. Be even more clear next time. \u201cHusband, as you are aware, I cannot do this chore. I understand we have different tolerances of messiness, but this is bothering me and between now and two days from now at blah time, I would appreciate if you could help me\u201d.", "NTA! Holy fuck, your husband is the AH if anything. He called you mean over lack of snuggles? He sounds entitled. If this is an isolated incident (as far as \"chores\" not getting done on his end), I would just remind him that you are on restriction still and he lives there too and needs to do his part. If it's not an isolated incident, sounds like you need to leave whatever mess he makes where it is and do your own chores until he realises that he needs to take part of the housework.", "NTA He said he would do it.
