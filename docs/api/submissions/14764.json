Which makes me the person who gets up at night when they have a problem or when we eat, im the one taking care of their eating and food.\n\n  \nIm still going to school and work afterwards, what leads to me coming home everyday at around 8 p.m. but instead of having Time to do my homework or learn something, my mother forces me to watch the kids and bring them to bed And afterwards I need to tidy up the kitchen and the living room, while also having to take care of their laundry and the trash that I take out. I sometimes feel like a Maiden in this house, but my mother just tells me to suck it up and I shouldn't be so spoiled, she had to do even more In her childhood.\n\n  \nEverytime I speak up about it, my mother calls me selfish and tells me that im just overreacting and every older sibling has to watch their siblings. While she also says, that I don't need this time to study, because im doing really good at school anyway. In between I wasn't even able to meet up with friends, cause she made me watch the kids and my social life basically endet or broke down, besides a few friends.   \n\n\n Now I told her, that I plan to move to the over side of the country to go to university there.  She is upset about this and everyday she asks me to stay here or study nearer to them, because i wouldn\u2019t realize how far away that is and I wouldnt come to visit then anymore.

While I agree that AUS is for sure gigantic compared to us, driving from one side of Germany to the other is about 6 - 10 hours drive. \n\nof course it depends on the specific cities but e.g. Munich as a major city in the south to Hamburg as a big city in the north takes 7hr 40min; Dresden in the east to K\u00f6ln in far west is 6h 20min and diagonal across the country from border to border is \\~ 10h 20 min)"]}
