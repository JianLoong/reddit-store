They're my older brother's daughters. He passed away 11 years ago. I have always been in their life and after my brother died it was through the courts I got to keep them in my life. Their mom and I were never close. She and I butted heads while my brother was alive and she didn't want me around once he was gone. But the fact my brother was gone and I was the last piece of his family, two judges (because she appealed the first decision) agreed that maintaining a relationship with me was in the best interest of the girls. We got along a little better for a while once the dust had settled but then she started dating her husband and he had problems with the fact the girls would always have me while any children they would have in the future would not have me and I was the most active person in any extended family they could claim. So bad blood returned.\n\nI have never wanted or looked to pursue a relationship with the younger half siblings my nieces have. They have three. Who are all under the age of 10 currently. I have met them a handful of times. But that's about it.\n\nThe girls' mom did try to use her younger kids as a reason to end my visitation rights to the girls but that failed because the judge told her many blended families deal with dynamics like this and do not find it harmful.\n\nNow both the girls are older and the relationship is more of an independent one. They can call and text me whenever they like and will invite me to stuff without going through their mom. It's so much better. Though I still know she's their mom and could make things more difficult outside the court ordered access if she wanted to.\n\nThis past year has been tough on the household financially. The girls have told me about it and now, their mom has told me they are not going to be able to do anything nice regarding presents for any of the kids, and she asked me to split the money I spend on the girls every year between all the kids. She said it would be the right thing to do because her younger kids are aware the girls get gifts from me every year and it would suck for them to get nothing they'll enjoy while the girls still get nice stuff.\n\nI said no. I said my responsibility was to the girls and not her other kids. She told me I'll be an asshole if I don't.\n\nWIBTA?", "created_utc": 1668250608, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yt3ton/wibta_if_i_dont_give_my_nieces_younger_siblings/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Under no circumstances are you TA.  You have had to fight costing you money, just to maintain a relationship.  Regarding xmas gifts, I don't get why people who have blended families think its ok, to tell people who they can give gifts to, when they are no relations.\n\nGive your nieces there gifts separately and without the parents knowing.  Not your problem their household budgets are getting tight, and donating to the \"mutual fund\" of presents", "NTA and I think it's admirable that you have jumped through so many legal hoops to keep a relationship with your brother's children. Your ex sister-in-law's inability to care for her additional children is not your problem and for her to try to guilt you into giving them gifts makes her TA.", "Yeah no NTA. After all she\u2019s put you through she wants you to support her children? Would probably have been very different had she acted like a human. She\u2019s likely cost you thousands. \n\nAlso, not your circus not your monkeys. Her request is ridiculous and I don\u2019t even believe what she\u2019s saying. I bet the husband is pulling those strings because he\u2019s jealous\u2026. Again.", "NTA - It is your money to spend as you choose. You have no relationship or ties to your former sister-in-law\u2019s children. After the way she\u2019s treated you, I can\u2019t believe she would even ask you to do this. The sense of entitlement from people today blows my mind. As a kid, I had an older half brother and sister who got things, trips, and presents that I did not. When my parents said, \u201cThat is from their Mom\u2019s family.\u201d, I never expected or even asked for the same treatment. \n\nYou won\u2019t even be there on Christmas morning to make a big show of it. She can have your nieces open up your gifts separately and ask them to not make a big deal of it in front of the other kids. A 17 and 15 yr. old I\u2019m sure would understand and be okay with it.", "Nta and i dont understand how people expect their exes family to care about their new kids after the relationship is over. Buy for your neices and let the parents and their family tend to the other kids. Im sorry but its not your problem.", "NTA.\n\nThis is more of a r/relationship_advice question than for here.\n\nIn my opinion, I\u2019d get the nieces the presents you would ordinarily get them. I\u2019d take them out to lunch or dinner to give the presents and ask them not to brag about the presents in front of their siblings. I\u2019d also send them home with small, inexpensive presents for all the siblings (including your nieces) to open together. This is not your family, but this is your nieces\u2019 family and you represent your side of it.  \n\nIt\u2019s not your job to appease the mother. It\u2019s also not your job to cause any more friction than you have to.", "NTA \u2014 She had no right to ask, and you had every right to refuse.  However, the half-siblings are just kids, and it does seem sad that they will have to watch the older sisters get nice things while they don\u2019t. And your nieces may feel a little bad about it.\n\nWould it be possible to give your nieces their gifts quietly, in a way that the younger kids don\u2019t notice the difference so much?  If all presents go under the tree, can you pack two things into one box so that your nieces don\u2019t have many more packages to open than the younger ones? \n\nI don\u2019t think you should give presents to the kids because it could easily become an expectation for future years, but maybe there could be a present to your nieces that they could enjoy with their siblings?  (For example a game of some sort.) \n\nIt sounds like your sis-in-law is a bit entitled.  NTA", "NTA. Take your nieces to lunch or another outing and give them the gifts there. Ask them not to be flashy. The fact your former SIL has taken you to court 3 times seals it. That is ridiculous. I would use the judges line, plenty of blended families do it this way. If your brother was still alive, would he be expected to buy presents for the kids of his ex and her new husband? Nope. \n\nI think its admirable you have fought to be in your niece's lives. They will always remember that they are loved and wanted and not discarded after their dad died.", "Remind her that she is the one that caused all of this taking you to court over and over so that\u2019s on her.", "NTA\n\nYou \"forced\" yourself into you niece life and now as she need present/money and both her and her husband you are good enough?\n\nNo", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your ex SIL is such a control freak that she thinks she can dictate your relationship with your nieces and with their half sisters. She is just building resentment from your nieces toward her and the half sisters. I can see where she might take their gifts and sell or return them to teach all of you a lesson.", "NTA\n\nShe can apply for gifts through a charitable organization.  There's no reason this woman should expect to spend your money on her other kids.\n\nI highly recommend that you consider asking your nieces if they have anything they need (clothes, toiletries, money on their school cafeteria account, sports or activities fees, costs for diver's education, etc...).  It may be that your niece's needs aren't all being met and that they need some support you aren't aware of.  \n\nAlso, if possible, you might let your nieces know that they could live with you when they're older and you might try to set aside funds to help them with further education.", "NTA", "NTA. Hell no. Why would you repay that treatment with kindness? Enjoy Christmas with the nieces, and let the mother sort it out for the others", "NTA a million times over. Give them to your family.", "Nta. This is entitled behavior.", "Definitely NTA. Your relationship is with your nieces, not their family. \n\nSuggestion though... It might be good to take your nieces out shopping for Christmas gifts they can give to their siblings on Christmas morning. Give them $10 to $20 each and take them to a Dollar Store. Perhaps even get a couple of small presents for your nieces too so that they can something to open on Christmas or to give to each other. \n\nI admit I love Christmas and hate to see anyone, who celebrates it, not able to get the joy and excitement from it: so that's 1 reason for the suggestion. They other is that doing this will foster the bonds that you have with your siblings and their father.", "NTA. Also INFO: Are your nieces in a tense household? Have their mother and step father pressured them to get you to consider their half siblings as their own? Also your nieces are old enough to pursue a relationship with you without their mother getting more in the way than she already has. Morally or ethically alone you don't owe her other children anything, but the fact you had to go to court to be in your nieces' life is a clear sign that you should have as little to do with their mother as possible. I hope you didn't have to pay too much for court...", "NTA... Does her new man not have any family on his side? Why do his kids fall on your shoulders?", "You and your brother's wife both sound like absolute nightmares.  You don't get along with your brother's wife so when he dies instead of both of you doing what's best for his kids, you turn it into a fucking court battle.  You've made no efforts to try to integrated with the rest of your nieces' family.  Their mom tried, again, to keep you out of their lives.  Just awful all around.  ESH.", "NTA.. Personally, I'd have tried to include them but.. She made it clear she didn't want you in the girls lives then they moaned ud ignore any others b4 they even existed and tried to kick u out again! They're made it super difficult for u and now they want u to do them favours!\n\nSadly its the kids that are going to be hurt tho.. Idk I'd get the older girls to sneak them something lol could even take them to get their younger siblings something so it's \"from them\" lol.. But u don't have to.. Just if I had that option I would try", "I wouldn't do that. I guarantee the mom is going to do something with the gifts. OP should take the girls out for lunch and give them their gifts herself.", "I agree. NTA. But it wouldn't shock me if the mom throws a fit and steals the girls' gifts out of anger or not to make the younger ones feel bad to see them.", "They have always gotten their stuff directly from me and opened them at my house. That was not going to be changing this year. Their mom still wanted me to send gifts to the other kids though.", "That's how it happens every year. I see them Christmas Eve usually, though sometimes it's a day or two after Christmas Day and I give the girls their gifts at my house and they open them with me.", "I'm guessing she would expect that from him if they had divorced instead of him passing away.", "I turned it into a court battle because she would not let me be in their lives and refused to discuss it with me. No, I don't integrate into the rest of their family because they are not part of my family and after the stuff my brother's wife pulled, I have no more interest in being part of her life. All I care about is my nieces here.", "I like this idea. If that\u2019s an option, I don\u2019t know where they live then I would do this as well.", "Oh i agree mom will probably try to pull some bs but there are ways around that as well. Theres no reason entitled mom should get to win here especially with the background info. Gotta keep a shiny spine with these types of people.", "Maybe just send the small ones nice cards?", "Then I don\u2019t see what the problem is.  Your nieces are old enough that you can tell them not to make a big deal about their gifts so as not to make the younger kids feel bad."]}
