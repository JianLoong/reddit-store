Their mom and I were never close. She and I butted heads while my brother was alive and she didn't want me around once he was gone. But the fact my brother was gone and I was the last piece of his family, two judges (because she appealed the first decision) agreed that maintaining a relationship with me was in the best interest of the girls. We got along a little better for a while once the dust had settled but then she started dating her husband and he had problems with the fact the girls would always have me while any children they would have in the future would not have me and I was the most active person in any extended family they could claim. So bad blood returned.\n\nI have never wanted or looked to pursue a relationship with the younger half siblings my nieces have. They have three. Who are all under the age of 10 currently. I have met them a handful of times. But that's about it.\n\nThe girls' mom did try to use her younger kids as a reason to end my visitation rights to the girls but that failed because the judge told her many blended families deal with dynamics like this and do not find it harmful.\n\nNow both the girls are older and the relationship is more of an independent one. They can call and text me whenever they like and will invite me to stuff without going through their mom. It's so much better. Though I still know she's their mom and could make things more difficult outside the court ordered access if she wanted to.\n\nThis past year has been tough on the household financially. The girls have told me about it and now, their mom has told me they are not going to be able to do anything nice regarding presents for any of the kids, and she asked me to split the money I spend on the girls every year between all the kids. She said it would be the right thing to do because her younger kids are aware the girls get gifts from me every year and it would suck for them to get nothing they'll enjoy while the girls still get nice stuff.\n\nI said no. I said my responsibility was to the girls and not her other kids.

Under no circumstances are you TA.  You have had to fight costing you money, just to maintain a relationship.  Regarding xmas gifts, I don't get why people who have blended families think its ok, to tell people who they can give gifts to, when they are no relations.\n\nGive your nieces there gifts separately and without the parents knowing.  Not your problem their household budgets are getting tight, and donating to the \"mutual fund\" of presents", "NTA and I think it's admirable that you have jumped through so many legal hoops to keep a relationship with your brother's children. Your ex sister-in-law's inability to care for her additional children is not your problem and for her to try to guilt you into giving them gifts makes her TA.", "Yeah no NTA. After all she\u2019s put you through she wants you to support her children? Would probably have been very different had she acted like a human. She\u2019s likely cost you thousands. \n\nAlso, not your circus not your monkeys. Her request is ridiculous and I don\u2019t even believe what she\u2019s saying.

You have no relationship or ties to your former sister-in-law\u2019s children. After the way she\u2019s treated you, I can\u2019t believe she would even ask you to do this. The sense of entitlement from people today blows my mind. As a kid, I had an older half brother and sister who got things, trips, and presents that I did not. When my parents said, \u201cThat is from their Mom\u2019s family.\u201d, I never expected or even asked for the same treatment. \n\nYou won\u2019t even be there on Christmas morning to make a big show of it.

I\u2019d take them out to lunch or dinner to give the presents and ask them not to brag about the presents in front of their siblings. I\u2019d also send them home with small, inexpensive presents for all the siblings (including your nieces) to open together. This is not your family, but this is your nieces\u2019 family and you represent your side of it.  \n\nIt\u2019s not your job to appease the mother. It\u2019s also not your job to cause any more friction than you have to.", "NTA \u2014 She had no right to ask, and you had every right to refuse.  However, the half-siblings are just kids, and it does seem sad that they will have to watch the older sisters get nice things while they don\u2019t. And your nieces may feel a little bad about it.\n\nWould it be possible to give your nieces their gifts quietly, in a way that the younger kids don\u2019t notice the difference so much?  If all presents go under the tree, can you pack two things into one box so that your nieces don\u2019t have many more packages to open than the younger ones? \n\nI don\u2019t think you should give presents to the kids because it could easily become an expectation for future years, but maybe there could be a present to your nieces that they could enjoy with their siblings?

I can see where she might take their gifts and sell or return them to teach all of you a lesson.", "NTA\n\nShe can apply for gifts through a charitable organization.  There's no reason this woman should expect to spend your money on her other kids.\n\nI highly recommend that you consider asking your nieces if they have anything they need (clothes, toiletries, money on their school cafeteria account, sports or activities fees, costs for diver's education, etc...).  It may be that your niece's needs aren't all being met and that they need some support you aren't aware of.  \n\nAlso, if possible, you might let your nieces know that they could live with you when they're older and you might try to set aside funds to help them with further education.", "NTA", "NTA. Hell no. Why would you repay that treatment with kindness? Enjoy Christmas with the nieces, and let the mother sort it out for the others", "NTA a million times over. Give them to your family.", "Nta. This is entitled behavior.", "Definitely NTA. Your relationship is with your nieces, not their family. \n\nSuggestion though... It might be good to take your nieces out shopping for Christmas gifts they can give to their siblings on Christmas morning. Give them $10 to $20 each and take them to a Dollar Store. Perhaps even get a couple of small presents for your nieces too so that they can something to open on Christmas or to give to each other. \n\nI admit I love Christmas and hate to see anyone, who celebrates it, not able to get the joy and excitement from it: so that's 1 reason for the suggestion. They other is that doing this will foster the bonds that you have with your siblings and their father.", "NTA. Also INFO: Are your nieces in a tense household? Have their mother and step father pressured them to get you to consider their half siblings as their own? Also your nieces are old enough to pursue a relationship with you without their mother getting more in the way than she already has. Morally or ethically alone you don't owe her other children anything, but the fact you had to go to court to be in your nieces' life is a clear sign that you should have as little to do with their mother as possible. I hope you didn't have to pay too much for court...", "NTA... Does her new man not have any family on his side? Why do his kids fall on your shoulders?", "You and your brother's wife both sound like absolute nightmares.  You don't get along with your brother's wife so when he dies instead of both of you doing what's best for his kids, you turn it into a fucking court battle.

Personally, I'd have tried to include them but.. She made it clear she didn't want you in the girls lives then they moaned ud ignore any others b4 they even existed and tried to kick u out again! They're made it super difficult for u and now they want u to do them favours!\n\nSadly its the kids that are going to be hurt tho.. Idk I'd get the older girls to sneak them something lol could even take them to get their younger siblings something so it's \"from them\" lol.. But u don't have to.. Just if I had that option I would try", "I wouldn't do that. I guarantee the mom is going to do something with the gifts. OP should take the girls out for lunch and give them their gifts herself.", "I agree. NTA.

That was not going to be changing this year. Their mom still wanted me to send gifts to the other kids though.", "That's how it happens every year. I see them Christmas Eve usually, though sometimes it's a day or two after Christmas Day and I give the girls their gifts at my house and they open them with me.", "I'm guessing she would expect that from him if they had divorced instead of him passing away.", "I turned it into a court battle because she would not let me be in their lives and refused to discuss it with me. No, I don't integrate into the rest of their family because they are not part of my family and after the stuff my brother's wife pulled, I have no more interest in being part of her life. All I care about is my nieces here.", "I like this idea. If that\u2019s an option, I don\u2019t know where they live then I would do this as well.", "Oh i agree mom will probably try to pull some bs but there are ways around that as well. Theres no reason entitled mom should get to win here especially with the background info. Gotta keep a shiny spine with these types of people.", "Maybe just send the small ones nice cards?", "Then I don\u2019t see what the problem is.  Your nieces are old enough that you can tell them not to make a big deal about their gifts so as not to make the younger kids feel bad.", "Maybe take the older girls out and give them a budget to spend on the younger siblings. No, you don\u2019t have to. But Christmas is just better if the kids can have some magic. \n\nYour nieces know their siblings and could pick out things they like. You then could all wrap the presents together. That way you\u2019re spending time with your nieces, but also doing something nice for their loved ones. \n\nDo you really want your nieces to have to see their siblings sad Christmas morning? Especially if you could spend time together making Christmas magic for them?", "NTA. Depending on how your nieces feel, how your finance are and whether money is really tight I might consider giving your nieces money to buy their siblings presents.

Give your nieces whatever you normally would, just don't do it in front of your niece's siblings. You don't owe them or their mother anything.\n\nThat said - and this is completely voluntary - there are 3 young kids who aren't going to be getting much for Christmas. These are kids that are important to your nieces. Maybe talk to your nieces about this. Maybe help them buy gifts for their siblings (you pay, but they pick out and wrap)? To me helping those that have less is an important part of the season and this could be a great way of imparting this to your nieces.", "NTA", "NTA  also I recommend giving your nieces something like a trip to a show with you this year rather than items that can be stolen from them and sold or exchanged for stuff for the younger kids because I would bet money on that happening.", "NTA. Your ex-sil kids aren't your responsibility, neither she treated you in a way to create a relationship with her new kids.", "NTA\n\nThis woman has tried to forcibly remove you from your nieces lives, and now wants to use you financially?\n\nSo long as you are not giving the gifts in front of the other children, this is not your problem", "NTA but I couldn't imagine leaving kids out on Christmas day knowing they're all in one household. It doesn't have to be 50 50 but a gift would go a long way for those children. I think it's more about kindness than rightness.", "NTA but I would be discrete in giving their gifts to them early and not front of the other kids.  \n\nGood for you for being in the nieces\u2019 lives.", "NTA\n\nBut consider getting them personalised gifts with their name literally on it to offset any chance of mum selling them or making them share.", "Absolutely NTA.

How fucking gross.", "NTA, she tried to limit your access to your nieces and now expect you to spend money on all of her kids? Your relatives are the two nieces and your responsibilities are only to that extend. Her other children are outsiders to you and you are not obligated to spend money on them. The other children can get their christmas present from either mom's or dad's side of the family. The mom is the AH for trying to limit your access to your nieces.

But it was her who decided to fight your wants to have a relationship with the girls. It was her who went to court several times to get you out of your nieces' lives. It was her who went to court after she met her husband once again. It was her doing that prevented you from even knowing her younger kids. (I don't say you even wanted a relationship with the youngest ones, but if you had wanted it just because they're you nieces' sibling, she would have prevented it anyways, right?)\n\nBut now, when it suits her, she wants you to be involved. And just with money. Entitled, much, right?", "NTA. She can reach out to her family, she can reach out to her new husbands family, she can reach out to both of their friends, colleagues and she can raise money for a few gifts.\n\nYour duty is to those two young women.

This Mom should sign the kids up for toys for tots, or an angel tree program if you are in the U.S. I think it might be a good idea to buy small inexpensive gifts for the younger girls, but that is a choice you have to make, after all it is your money, and no one can tell you what to do with it. The parents have not treated you well, so you don't owe them any favors.\n\nYou could take your nieces out to dinner and a movie for a present, or something else that won't cause jealousy on Christmas day.

Besides the kinda things they would get aren't things kids under 10 should probably have. Besides if the mom had been nicer to you from the start you probably would have been more willing to build a relationship with the other chilren and help that's her fault not yours. I'm sure they can just go to the thift store and get many toys for kids under 10 and they'll just be hype to open so many and not even notice. Hell they can buy candy and wrap that up. I've been doing that for my step son for years. He's always been happy and greatful. Once I wrapped a bandana for him and he got so happy because it's like how his dad wears. Kids don't notice things unless adults make it obvious and I bet she has a spare 20 to grab a few gifts. I'm literally about to play a used jenga set with the kiddo now. We had finished up with our used apples to apples game. Both things gotten from a thirft store in perfect condition. If she wasn't such a evil person I'd say she could also go on reddit and ask for a donated gift. One year we were really bad and a few kind redditors sent him a few gifts. He was so happy to open gifts from the kindness of strangers. There's a way for her to do this without trying to bring you in. It's just easier to make you the bad guy then to be a parent it seems smh. Good lucky", "Nta.

Or did she only asked you?", "NTA\u2026 But consider doing something for the other kids. Why? It\u2019s less of a headache and will keep your nieces from feeling guilty. They will notice the disparity as much as the younger children. You can be the hero. Way cheaper than dealing with another attorney and it will give you major positive interactions with the xSIL and her husband. \n\nOlder kids have more expensive gifts. You\u2019d be shocked how many smaller but fun gifts you can give a child under 10 compared to a teenager. Just make sure it\u2019s something that the mom can\u2019t intercept/return/redistribute. Clothes are always nice and I doubt the younger siblings are nowhere near the same size. Additionally, teenagers will love designer clothes that a young child would think is a terrible gift (not a toy).", "You are not the AH.

Something super small like books or chocolate.", "I do not think you owe those children any gifts, and I have some worry about the family using a one-time gift from you as a precedent to expect/demand more of you in the future. Despite that, I think you can choose to be kind to children without trapping yourself going forward.\n\nMaybe consider the idea of gifting some DVDs or a board game that all the kids can enjoy (there are some that appeal to a wide age-range). or a gift card to a restaurant. You are not giving each step sibling their own gift. You are just giving a gift that all the children can enjoy. You've seen those Christmas tree angels where you pick it and buy a gift for kids whose family can't afford much for Christmas? This is similar; you just happen to know the kids. This is only a suggestion.", "Nta, give the gifts to the girls in private so mom doesn\u2019t try to destroy them or make them share.

Especially since their mom implied that you should split what budget you\u2019d have for your nieces amongst all the kids instead? And not just the two of them? \n\nI would suggest that maybe you could buy something that all of them could use together? Like a board game maybe? or something related to things all the kids have in common.", "I'd say tge money i spent on court costs could've gone to your other kids but you ruined that for them", "I agree, she is definitely NTA. I don't understand the whole blended family forcing their family to include their stepchildren in everything. It's like they take away a person's right to choose who they consider family. Some people only see family as blood related, that is fine. Just like some people create a family of friends, that is perfectly alright. They all get to choose. It seems like they do not see the uniqueness of their own family and try to look like a nuclear family.

Lots of places will give gifts to families. It may not be much, but even if you don't qualify for gifts, some places will give you gifts if you show up Christmas eve and ask.", "I really feel like this is the answer.
