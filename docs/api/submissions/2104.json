Their mom and I were never close. She and I butted heads while my brother was alive and she didn't want me around once he was gone. But the fact my brother was gone and I was the last piece of his family, two judges (because she appealed the first decision) agreed that maintaining a relationship with me was in the best interest of the girls. We got along a little better for a while once the dust had settled but then she started dating her husband and he had problems with the fact the girls would always have me while any children they would have in the future would not have me and I was the most active person in any extended family they could claim. So bad blood returned.\n\nI have never wanted or looked to pursue a relationship with the younger half siblings my nieces have. They have three. Who are all under the age of 10 currently. I have met them a handful of times. But that's about it.\n\nThe girls' mom did try to use her younger kids as a reason to end my visitation rights to the girls but that failed because the judge told her many blended families deal with dynamics like this and do not find it harmful.\n\nNow both the girls are older and the relationship is more of an independent one. They can call and text me whenever they like and will invite me to stuff without going through their mom. It's so much better. Though I still know she's their mom and could make things more difficult outside the court ordered access if she wanted to.\n\nThis past year has been tough on the household financially. The girls have told me about it and now, their mom has told me they are not going to be able to do anything nice regarding presents for any of the kids, and she asked me to split the money I spend on the girls every year between all the kids. She said it would be the right thing to do because her younger kids are aware the girls get gifts from me every year and it would suck for them to get nothing they'll enjoy while the girls still get nice stuff.\n\nI said no. I said my responsibility was to the girls and not her other kids.

Regarding xmas gifts, I don't get why people who have blended families think its ok, to tell people who they can give gifts to, when they are no relations.\n\nGive your nieces there gifts separately and without the parents knowing.  Not your problem their household budgets are getting tight, and donating to the \"mutual fund\" of presents", "NTA and I think it's admirable that you have jumped through so many legal hoops to keep a relationship with your brother's children. Your ex sister-in-law's inability to care for her additional children is not your problem and for her to try to guilt you into giving them gifts makes her TA.", "Yeah no NTA. After all she\u2019s put you through she wants you to support her children? Would probably have been very different had she acted like a human. She\u2019s likely cost you thousands. \n\nAlso, not your circus not your monkeys. Her request is ridiculous and I don\u2019t even believe what she\u2019s saying.

You have no relationship or ties to your former sister-in-law\u2019s children. After the way she\u2019s treated you, I can\u2019t believe she would even ask you to do this. The sense of entitlement from people today blows my mind. As a kid, I had an older half brother and sister who got things, trips, and presents that I did not. When my parents said, \u201cThat is from their Mom\u2019s family.\u201d, I never expected or even asked for the same treatment. \n\nYou won\u2019t even be there on Christmas morning to make a big show of it.

I\u2019d take them out to lunch or dinner to give the presents and ask them not to brag about the presents in front of their siblings. I\u2019d also send them home with small, inexpensive presents for all the siblings (including your nieces) to open together. This is not your family, but this is your nieces\u2019 family and you represent your side of it.  \n\nIt\u2019s not your job to appease the mother. It\u2019s also not your job to cause any more friction than you have to.", "NTA \u2014 She had no right to ask, and you had every right to refuse.  However, the half-siblings are just kids, and it does seem sad that they will have to watch the older sisters get nice things while they don\u2019t. And your nieces may feel a little bad about it.\n\nWould it be possible to give your nieces their gifts quietly, in a way that the younger kids don\u2019t notice the difference so much?  If all presents go under the tree, can you pack two things into one box so that your nieces don\u2019t have many more packages to open than the younger ones? \n\nI don\u2019t think you should give presents to the kids because it could easily become an expectation for future years, but maybe there could be a present to your nieces that they could enjoy with their siblings?

There's no reason this woman should expect to spend your money on her other kids.\n\nI highly recommend that you consider asking your nieces if they have anything they need (clothes, toiletries, money on their school cafeteria account, sports or activities fees, costs for diver's education, etc...).  It may be that your niece's needs aren't all being met and that they need some support you aren't aware of.  \n\nAlso, if possible, you might let your nieces know that they could live with you when they're older and you might try to set aside funds to help them with further education.", "NTA", "NTA. Hell no. Why would you repay that treatment with kindness? Enjoy Christmas with the nieces, and let the mother sort it out for the others", "NTA a million times over. Give them to your family.", "Nta. This is entitled behavior.", "Definitely NTA. Your relationship is with your nieces, not their family. \n\nSuggestion though... It might be good to take your nieces out shopping for Christmas gifts they can give to their siblings on Christmas morning. Give them $10 to $20 each and take them to a Dollar Store. Perhaps even get a couple of small presents for your nieces too so that they can something to open on Christmas or to give to each other. \n\nI admit I love Christmas and hate to see anyone, who celebrates it, not able to get the joy and excitement from it: so that's 1 reason for the suggestion. They other is that doing this will foster the bonds that you have with your siblings and their father.", "NTA. Also INFO: Are your nieces in a tense household? Have their mother and step father pressured them to get you to consider their half siblings as their own? Also your nieces are old enough to pursue a relationship with you without their mother getting more in the way than she already has. Morally or ethically alone you don't owe her other children anything, but the fact you had to go to court to be in your nieces' life is a clear sign that you should have as little to do with their mother as possible.

Why do his kids fall on your shoulders?", "You and your brother's wife both sound like absolute nightmares.  You don't get along with your brother's wife so when he dies instead of both of you doing what's best for his kids, you turn it into a fucking court battle.

Personally, I'd have tried to include them but.. She made it clear she didn't want you in the girls lives then they moaned ud ignore any others b4 they even existed and tried to kick u out again! They're made it super difficult for u and now they want u to do them favours!\n\nSadly its the kids that are going to be hurt tho.. Idk I'd get the older girls to sneak them something lol could even take them to get their younger siblings something so it's \"from them\" lol.. But u don't have to.. Just if I had that option I would try", "I wouldn't do that. I guarantee the mom is going to do something with the gifts.

That was not going to be changing this year. Their mom still wanted me to send gifts to the other kids though.", "That's how it happens every year. I see them Christmas Eve usually, though sometimes it's a day or two after Christmas Day and I give the girls their gifts at my house and they open them with me.", "I'm guessing she would expect that from him if they had divorced instead of him passing away.", "I turned it into a court battle because she would not let me be in their lives and refused to discuss it with me. No, I don't integrate into the rest of their family because they are not part of my family and after the stuff my brother's wife pulled, I have no more interest in being part of her life. All I care about is my nieces here.", "I like this idea. If that\u2019s an option, I don\u2019t know where they live then I would do this as well.", "Oh i agree mom will probably try to pull some bs but there are ways around that as well. Theres no reason entitled mom should get to win here especially with the background info. Gotta keep a shiny spine with these types of people.", "Maybe just send the small ones nice cards?", "Then I don\u2019t see what the problem is.

No, you don\u2019t have to. But Christmas is just better if the kids can have some magic. \n\nYour nieces know their siblings and could pick out things they like. You then could all wrap the presents together. That way you\u2019re spending time with your nieces, but also doing something nice for their loved ones. \n\nDo you really want your nieces to have to see their siblings sad Christmas morning? Especially if you could spend time together making Christmas magic for them?", "NTA. Depending on how your nieces feel, how your finance are and whether money is really tight I might consider giving your nieces money to buy their siblings presents.

You don't owe them or their mother anything.\n\nThat said - and this is completely voluntary - there are 3 young kids who aren't going to be getting much for Christmas. These are kids that are important to your nieces. Maybe talk to your nieces about this. Maybe help them buy gifts for their siblings (you pay, but they pick out and wrap)? To me helping those that have less is an important part of the season and this could be a great way of imparting this to your nieces.", "NTA", "NTA  also I recommend giving your nieces something like a trip to a show with you this year rather than items that can be stolen from them and sold or exchanged for stuff for the younger kids because I would bet money on that happening.", "NTA.

It doesn't have to be 50 50 but a gift would go a long way for those children. I think it's more about kindness than rightness.", "NTA but I would be discrete in giving their gifts to them early and not front of the other kids.  \n\nGood for you for being in the nieces\u2019 lives.", "NTA\n\nBut consider getting them personalised gifts with their name literally on it to offset any chance of mum selling them or making them share.", "Absolutely NTA.

How fucking gross.", "NTA, she tried to limit your access to your nieces and now expect you to spend money on all of her kids? Your relatives are the two nieces and your responsibilities are only to that extend. Her other children are outsiders to you and you are not obligated to spend money on them.

But it was her who decided to fight your wants to have a relationship with the girls. It was her who went to court several times to get you out of your nieces' lives.

She can reach out to her family, she can reach out to her new husbands family, she can reach out to both of their friends, colleagues and she can raise money for a few gifts.\n\nYour duty is to those two young women.

Like there are so many factors. But. Also forcing them to say 'I love you' and actually bond is 100% going too far, just don't exclude them or rub their nose in the differences.", "but it is. OP doesnt even have a relationship with the younger kids.\n\ntheir dad can provide that. given the logic of your statement, the stepdad causes jealousy in the household for existing. see how ridiculous it sounds?\n\nmay i remind you that the two older daughters dont have what the younger ones have. they dont have their father. they have OP to provide what should have been given by their father.", "Out of curiosity, do the younger kids get gifts from (or quality time with) relatives on their father's side that your nieces do not? Also, has anyone brought up to him that he may think them having more gifts is not fair, but his kids have both their parents whereas the nieces' don't get to have their father?", "So the core issue here is that the mother is trying to make monetary demands of you, once again not treating you like an equal, when she's already an adversary that you've had to spend tremendous amounts fighting to be able to even have contact with your nieces. She's such an asshole", "Even have the girls help out around the house to \"earn\" the money.", "The nieces are 17and 15. Very easy for them to visit OP sometime around Christmas on their own. As long as they don't go home and say to their younger siblings \"ooh. Look what we got and you got nothing\" everything will be fine and the kids won't notice they got anything at all", "Yeah this right here, and especially because you have a bad relationship with a sister-in-law, don't go extending yourself making a college fund because there is no way she will respect that.\n\nI had to check a small gift at them, or get them nothing. Don't start a relationship with her children", "they will then expect this every year.", "why? they have no relationship. OP is not even friends with former SIL. at best, they're just civil.", "There is the problem, this woman just truly does not respect the poster and is now trying to get more money out of them.", "I think the reason OP might hesitate is because the mom tried to cut them out. I\u2019m guessing that your mom did not do the same (hopefully)", "i assume your stepdad and gma have a good enough relationship.\n\ni agree with you that former SIL is bonkers.", "I'm not talking about sending expensive gifts, like iPads or playstations or the like. Rather, I'd consider sending a board game for everyone and one small gift each for the younger kids.\n\nI repeat, it's not an obligation, it would just be a nice thing to do.\n\nOP doesn't have to do anything. BUT, giving small gifts to the other kids might make for a nicer environment for the two that he loves, which would be my concern.", "Christ dude, they aren't going to be able to afford an elaborate Christmas this year. That's hardly financially struggling enough to even consider trying to take the kids", "Dude I was trying to underline that OP is waaay kinder than I would have been. I know you can't take people's kids and I have no intention of doing so. I just said I'll think it in mind for satisfaction.", "NTA, but talk to your nieces.  They might be aware of the financial issues and care that their half siblings get a good Christmas.", "NTA. Blended families are tough sometimes and things can be unequal. That's life. \n\nYou will not be an AH I'd you do nothing for the younger kids. \n\nThat said you could take your nieces shopping and help them buy a gift for each of the younger kids. Something small they would like from their older sisters. Set a small budget and help them shop and wrap. If you can swing it financially it would be a kind thing to do. Not because the mom deserves it but because watching the younger kids get nothing could be hard for your nieces. The kids are innocent in their Mom and Dad's bad behavior. But you know the dynamics best. If this one time nice gesture is going to turn into yearly guilt trips from the mom then don't do it.", "NTA. You owe nothing to these people.  Christmas, in my opinion, is just an excuse for people to demand stuff from others.", "NTA but if it\u2019s a small kindness that keeps a modicum of peace\u2026not an equal gift but some kind of gesture. Sometimes it\u2019s easier to just go the extra mile.", "I don\u2019t think you are the asshole. There is no need for you to give them presents but as an adult who maybe has a couple dollars extra it would be nice to get them a little something. Just because they have done nothing wrong and a little smile and thank you doesn\u2019t hurt anybody.", "NTA\n\nIf ya'll had been civil and everything throughout the years. I would say hey go to the dollar store pick them up some cheap toys. But since their mom and stepdad are so difficult it would probably turn into a yearly expectation for you to fund the entire family Christmas. Better to keep it to just the girls.", "NTA. But if you\u2019re such a great aunt why do you wanna make the little ones suffer when it\u2019s not their fault that all this garbage is going on? They don\u2019t understand. Be the bigger person.", "NTA and WNBTA\n\nMaybe it's not too late for them to sign up for Angel Tree, Toys for Tots, or other Christmas charities", "NTA\nIt's not your responsibility at all. But would you consider maybe paying for presents for the younger kids from their older siblings?? I get the feeling mom might put some pressure on the kids to share or perhaps sell their gifts to help pay for something for the younger ones. Glad you decided to stay involved with your nieces though, they will always appreciate that.", "NTA\n\nI kinda get what she means but the half siblings are definitely not your responsibility.\n\nSure it would be nice if they got something like a colouring bookmor whatever. But I think you said you have no real contact. So yeah.. I wouldn't be buying anything either. \n\nIsn't it funny their mom tries her hardest to make you \"vanish\" but once it's convenient you're more than welcome to pay for the other kids, too.", "NTA, but if your financial situation allows, you could give your nieces money so they can buy their little sisters\u2019 gifts. You aren\u2019t obligated but the young ones aren\u2019t at fault here.", "NTA and you absolutely do not have to split gifts equally, but it would be kind to the younger children to get them something kid-pleasing but inexpensive. \n\nIf those somethings are noisy, messy, or otherwise irritating to adults, so much the better. \n\nIf you really want to never hear about this again, get each child a puppy.", "NTA. If you want to take the moral high ground, have your nieces' gifts be something like a day long experience with you, especially if it is something the other kids are too young to enjoy like going to a play or a musical or a museum aligned with your niece's interests. Your ex-SIL is just trying to use you to make up for gaps in the family budget. I get she is struggling, but she's also teaching her kids to be materialistic. I have nephews under 10 and they are looking at the gifts they get in terms of how it aligns to their interests, not how \"nice\" it is.", "NTA. But maybe the gifts could be experiences combination of concert/standup/sporting event, a meal at a nice restaurant, spa/pedicures? The under 10 children won't have much interest in that. So maybe it will cause less jealousy compared to physical items. Spending a weekend together making memories might be a nice gift. A bonus is this gift cannot be stolen away or sold off to forcefully share.\n\nthe younger siblings should be getting attention from their father's extended family. Their failing is not your fault. It's not an excuse for you to do less for your nieces.", "You could always do a super annoying present for the younger ones lol- my parents always called them aunt and uncle gifts. Some kahzoos, foam swords, nerf gun, singing stuffies, a xylophone, a little karaoke microphone, a bead set with tons of tiny beads, maracas- I have a lot of ideas. The kids are little and would love them and the parents would hate it but you did what they asked \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nObviously you have no obligation, NTA.", "Your neices are old enough for you to privately ask them what they would like to do. If they would like to share \\*some\\* of the money that would be spent on them for the youngers then you can maybe take 25% of what you would have spent on them (they don't have to know it is 25%) and let them be involved in picking out the presents and let them take them home to their younger siblings. Let them be the heroes. Maybe explain the spirit of Christmas and giving and all and let them make decision with your help. They are going to feel the wrath if they come home with nothing. And you are also teaching them about giving and sharing in the holiday spirit. You will be the bigger person in this instance and they will remember that. ETA: this shouldn't be a decision you make about spite or serves their mom right. THis is ultimately about children and the holiday. It should be about what is best for your nieces. This is a tremendous teaching moment and they are well old enough to absorb it.", "NTA but you can be a bigger and loveable person. A gift, not just about money is more like spreading the happiness. It could leave a good memory and bring happiness to the children for many years to come. At the same time you're showing a positive attitude to your 2 nieces, you're not just uncle to both of them but to the family as well. Both of your nieces know they had a tight financial issue, the gift doesn't have to be lavish, it's the thought that count. Wish you have a Very Merry and Blessed Christmas.", "NTA. You had to fight to be able to stay in your nieces' lives. It's not on you to foot the bill for her kids with her new husband. Why isn't he paying for Christmas for his own kids? Either one of them can go work a seasonal job to fund Christmas for their kids; I've done it before. If finances are really that tight for them, they can sign the young ones up at Salvation Army or one of the other giving trees.", "NTA. You are not required to give your nieces siblings gifts. However, it would be a nice thing to do (if you can afford it). Maybe take your nieces shopping to pick out a gift for each of their siblings (or maybe a group gift like a fun game or movie or something).  Keep it small, nothing too big, and then they can gift to their siblings. Obviously not required, but would be a kind thing for innocent children that have shitty parents.", "NTA You would be TA for  doing what the mom asked.  If she wanted that kind of a relationship where you wee Uncle even though not bio she should have fostered that relationship with you. But she didn't so don't let her guilt you into doing it.", "NTA but i auggest giving your gifts directly ro the girls when the half siblins are not present and let them know not to rub it in the kids faces.", "NTA. \n\nI was poor growing up. I was satisfied with a Christmas dinner and a stocking.", "NTA Nope don\u2019t get them a thing! Or give them a penny! She doesn\u2019t want you in your own nieces lives and take you to court multiple times and waste both you and her time and money then because her snivelling man get jealous and sees your worth, then they have financial difficulties all of a sudden you\u2019re good enough for something\u2026 spending your money on all her kids hoping to force you into assuming responsibility for her younger kids gifts that you\u2019re not related to and she expects consistently over how many years\u2026 then calls you an arsehole for refusing to be stupid\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t even wrap her my spit! You\u2019re absolutely NTA she the classless AH. \n\nYou\u2019re an awesome aunty and your nieces are lucky to have you in their corner", "NTA mom needs to start looking onto charities/churches to help provide a Christmas for the kids not you if don't want to.\n\nIf it's important to her that her kids have a good Christmas than she needs to get her ass in gear and handle it.", "NTA. But to avoid conflict maybe you should make sure you give them their gifts while they are visiting you to not rub it in the faces of the other kids.", "This is not the hill to die on.  Show your nieces by example what good adults do and get the smaller ones gifts.  You will never be TA if you always choose kindness.", "NTA. She fought to have you lose rights to visiting the girls, and now she\u2019s asking for you to split costs for gifts for her other kids? Stand your ground and say no. She\u2019s entitled and probably wouldn\u2019t be genuinely grateful for your help anyway.", "No, NTA. I would give small gifts to the other kids if I had the chance, like a small plushie or something, but as a nice gesture (because they are already screwed with the mother they got), not because it's any of your business or obligation. And then I'd gift the mom a copy of \"Managing your Money for Dummies\". You don't need to choose between kind and petty \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "There are resources for parents who can't afford kids for their kids.  There is no reason OP's money for her nieces gifts need to be split.\n\nBut OP should be cognizant of the household dynamics and gift the kids their gifts when they are with her, not give them to be opened in front of their siblings.\n\nIf SIL wants to get snippy about it, OP should look up when and where their local Tots for Tots or similar program sign ups happen, and send that info over to SIL every time she brings up things being \"unfair\".", "I love this, but I am also a sucker for giving presents lol", "I remember my kids getting gifts without off switches. Noisy gifts. One would go off randomly and would do so in the middle of the night. That would be a kind thing to do...it's for the children after all", "How about the money SHE spent on court costs could have gone to them!", "I don\u2019t think the sil was just asking for token gifts for the younger kids.  I think the sil wanted more substantial gifts.\n\nMy thought here is for the nieces.  If they get to be made to feel guilty because they get gifts from OP and the others don\u2019t, that could be a problem.", "It\u2019s just life, though\u2026my sibs and me had different godparents, and some of the godparents would give a gift to their godchild at Christmas while others wouldn\u2019t. I watered the next door neighbor\u2019s plants when she was away and she always gave me a lovely gift but not my sibs. The girls in this case are getting gifts from their relative who isn\u2019t a relative of the younger kids.", "The younger children are young enough that the contrast in presents can be obscured by \u201cthey are the big girls, and this is from their daddy\u2019s family.\u201d   This is on the mother, who has done her best to exclude OP, but now wants help with buying presents for her kids.", "Every kid has to learn this, but it sounds like this Christmas the nieces half-siblings will be getting fewer (or lesser) presents than usual because their parents are short of money.  That is sad. (Not that the nieces have better/more presents usually, but that *this Christmas* the siblings will be getting less than usual.) It is still not the OPs problem unless the nieces get guilted by their mother.", "Yes.  I read all of that.  I advised professional help for her (OP) grief, and pointed out the ex-SIL's behavior sounds like grief too.", "I didn't tell OP to focus on people she isn't related to, I advised her to get professional help for her grief.", "~~~~m cw xz i pju", "Sorry the situation you're describing is disgusting IMO! You're telling me that a 7 year old has to watch that?! I'm an adult and when I've been to my friends' homes their parents have always been lovely and gotten me one gift to open up on Christmas. That ain't  right. I'm not saying that they have to buy gifts of equal value but a few wouldn't hurt. \n\nMy heart hurts for that little boy.", "In that situation, I think the uncles should have given the gifts for their nephew at one of their homes. It is up to the parents to explain to the children in regards to relations. Parents choose to blend families, it is their sole responsibility to teach their children the difference between a blended family and a nuclear family. How the outside family members decide on family relations is one of the major differences. I just don't understand the concept of who a person marries entitles them to a family that didn't get to vote them in.", "Can you elaborate on the excluding them part? Because one child having access to many family members while the other doesn't means that there will definitely be some exclusion.", "I also wonder about the girls' survivors benefits. If they're in a bigger house because of the three additional kids and so the girls are ending up with much less because of the three additional kids/higher household expenses, that seems really sus to me.\n\nNTA, OP.", "This is a good idea, especially since the younger ones not getting gifts might lead to jealousy and negatively affects the relationship between nieces and their half siblings.", "I suggested that too, especially since the nieces might feel guilty about getting more presents, and a gift they could share with the younger siblings would make everyone (except the controlling sis-in-law) feel better.", "Well. Christmas is around every year, but family emergencies are not. Someone losing their job, a car accident, a expensive sickness... that sort of thing is more urgent and can absorb Christmas money. \n\nI understand not feeling familial love for other kids, or even actively disliking them. But there's disliking a kid and there's being cruel to a kid. And showing off presents in front of a kid is cruel. \n\nSomething small, even like a plate of cookies could be nice.", "Generally, that would be my advice too, but in this case the problem is this entitled and controlling sis-in-law might make it an issue every Xmas after this.  Given that the OP has not really been welcome \u201cinto\u201d that blended family, having pressure to give gifts to the other kids is just not a good thing.   That\u2019s why I think a gift for the nieces and their siblings (like a board game) is as far as it should go.", "Where are getting the idea OP needs professional help? Because they won't buy other kids presents?", "Yea.. It destroyed my opinion on the family and i refused to do a holiday there again- I was a teen and there with one of the nieces so my opinion didn't matter but.. I was absolutely horrified even at that age seeing what was done. I think the fact that everyone acted as if it was so.. normal, traumatized me a bit.", "Oh I'm fine with doing it that way - it's more if you're going to do a huge family gathering do things at least a little equally. If you want to show favoritism for that reason - while I don't understand- everyone is entitled to make their own decisions.  It's the fact that it was done so blatantly that bothered me.", "Agreed.", "Like. If you're all going to be at the same event at least acknowledge them. I'll use Christmas as an example since it's easier to reference using a specific Holliday or event - obvs not every fam does Christmas. If it's like two different Christmases, it's no big deal. If it's one big Christmas with where both sets of step parents are there no big deal. But say one parent had Christmas another a different holiday. It's not fair for that child to sit at their step grandparents house and not get at least something- no it doesn't have to be extravagant it's mainly about showing that you do know they exist and don't want them to be excluded. It's mainly only an issue imo in families where the child lives fully with one parent but the people in their life still treat them like they're just part time. Or situations like that where they aren't getting two of things because of how parents have divided things. But. Thats just my opinion based on things I've seen. I don't think anyone should be forced to develop a bond with someone, and depending on economical situations of families some half sibs, or step sibs will naturally get more - but I also don't think a child should be made to feel left out in a situation they didn't create. There's a difference between not getting as much and not getting acknowledged.", "Do you know what grieving people sound like (write like) when they let it fester for years and decades?  It sounds like OP.  And ex-SIL.  The whole post is about grieving for a dead loved one.", "I can imagine.  It's just cruel.", "Honestly like some playdoh or bouncy balls or something would work lol. I agree the OP is NTA but if she WANTS to it would be a nice gesture for sure.", "Yes, I do. I don't get an unhealthy grieving vibe from OP at all.", "It is unhealthy because she's causing drama in another family's house by showering gifts on (nurturing relationships with) some family members and not others, leading to more hurt feelings, anger and confusion.  \n\nI realize that no one has ANY compassion for ex-SIL (or the new husband i guess) but there are two small children who don't deserve to be used as pawns in a fight that they didn't start over a man they never met. \n\nOP and ex-SIL are \"in a fight\" and they will always be \"in a fight\" until one of them stops it.  They aren't \"in a fight\" because of ideologies or religious conflict or racial tension.  They are \"in a fight\" because they are both grieving.  They'd rather be \"in a fight\" than move on with their lives.  \n\nThus, get professional help.\n\nYou can pick a fight with family members for the rest of your lives (people do this after a death A LOT) or you can grieve.", "The other kids aren't connected at all. There's no relationship there. So she put up a healthy boundary. That's not unhealthy grieving. That's actually pretty common. People who aren't related don't always get treated like they are.", "The world is a cold and cruel place.  I hope you never find yourself in need of compassion, because you reap what you sow.", "Thank God I've sown well then. Because I have needed compassion and received it and given to others. But clearly you know me somehow since you're implying I don't?"]}
