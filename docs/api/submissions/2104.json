Their mom and I were never close. She and I butted heads while my brother was alive and she didn't want me around once he was gone. But the fact my brother was gone and I was the last piece of his family, two judges (because she appealed the first decision) agreed that maintaining a relationship with me was in the best interest of the girls. We got along a little better for a while once the dust had settled but then she started dating her husband and he had problems with the fact the girls would always have me while any children they would have in the future would not have me and I was the most active person in any extended family they could claim. So bad blood returned.\n\nI have never wanted or looked to pursue a relationship with the younger half siblings my nieces have. They have three. Who are all under the age of 10 currently. I have met them a handful of times. But that's about it.\n\nThe girls' mom did try to use her younger kids as a reason to end my visitation rights to the girls but that failed because the judge told her many blended families deal with dynamics like this and do not find it harmful.\n\nNow both the girls are older and the relationship is more of an independent one. They can call and text me whenever they like and will invite me to stuff without going through their mom. It's so much better. Though I still know she's their mom and could make things more difficult outside the court ordered access if she wanted to.\n\nThis past year has been tough on the household financially. The girls have told me about it and now, their mom has told me they are not going to be able to do anything nice regarding presents for any of the kids, and she asked me to split the money I spend on the girls every year between all the kids. She said it would be the right thing to do because her younger kids are aware the girls get gifts from me every year and it would suck for them to get nothing they'll enjoy while the girls still get nice stuff.\n\nI said no. I said my responsibility was to the girls and not her other kids.

Under no circumstances are you TA.  You have had to fight costing you money, just to maintain a relationship.  Regarding xmas gifts, I don't get why people who have blended families think its ok, to tell people who they can give gifts to, when they are no relations.\n\nGive your nieces there gifts separately and without the parents knowing.  Not your problem their household budgets are getting tight, and donating to the \"mutual fund\" of presents", "NTA and I think it's admirable that you have jumped through so many legal hoops to keep a relationship with your brother's children. Your ex sister-in-law's inability to care for her additional children is not your problem and for her to try to guilt you into giving them gifts makes her TA.", "Yeah no NTA. After all she\u2019s put you through she wants you to support her children? Would probably have been very different had she acted like a human. She\u2019s likely cost you thousands. \n\nAlso, not your circus not your monkeys. Her request is ridiculous and I don\u2019t even believe what she\u2019s saying. I bet the husband is pulling those strings because he\u2019s jealous\u2026. Again.", "NTA - It is your money to spend as you choose. You have no relationship or ties to your former sister-in-law\u2019s children. After the way she\u2019s treated you, I can\u2019t believe she would even ask you to do this. The sense of entitlement from people today blows my mind. As a kid, I had an older half brother and sister who got things, trips, and presents that I did not. When my parents said, \u201cThat is from their Mom\u2019s family.\u201d, I never expected or even asked for the same treatment. \n\nYou won\u2019t even be there on Christmas morning to make a big show of it.

A 17 and 15 yr. old I\u2019m sure would understand and be okay with it.", "Nta and i dont understand how people expect their exes family to care about their new kids after the relationship is over. Buy for your neices and let the parents and their family tend to the other kids. Im sorry but its not your problem.", "NTA.\n\nThis is more of a r/relationship_advice question than for here.\n\nIn my opinion, I\u2019d get the nieces the presents you would ordinarily get them. I\u2019d take them out to lunch or dinner to give the presents and ask them not to brag about the presents in front of their siblings. I\u2019d also send them home with small, inexpensive presents for all the siblings (including your nieces) to open together. This is not your family, but this is your nieces\u2019 family and you represent your side of it.  \n\nIt\u2019s not your job to appease the mother. It\u2019s also not your job to cause any more friction than you have to.", "NTA \u2014 She had no right to ask, and you had every right to refuse.  However, the half-siblings are just kids, and it does seem sad that they will have to watch the older sisters get nice things while they don\u2019t. And your nieces may feel a little bad about it.\n\nWould it be possible to give your nieces their gifts quietly, in a way that the younger kids don\u2019t notice the difference so much?  If all presents go under the tree, can you pack two things into one box so that your nieces don\u2019t have many more packages to open than the younger ones? \n\nI don\u2019t think you should give presents to the kids because it could easily become an expectation for future years, but maybe there could be a present to your nieces that they could enjoy with their siblings?  (For example a game of some sort.) \n\nIt sounds like your sis-in-law is a bit entitled.  NTA", "NTA. Take your nieces to lunch or another outing and give them the gifts there. Ask them not to be flashy. The fact your former SIL has taken you to court 3 times seals it. That is ridiculous. I would use the judges line, plenty of blended families do it this way. If your brother was still alive, would he be expected to buy presents for the kids of his ex and her new husband? Nope. \n\nI think its admirable you have fought to be in your niece's lives.

Your ex SIL is such a control freak that she thinks she can dictate your relationship with your nieces and with their half sisters. She is just building resentment from your nieces toward her and the half sisters. I can see where she might take their gifts and sell or return them to teach all of you a lesson.", "NTA\n\nShe can apply for gifts through a charitable organization.  There's no reason this woman should expect to spend your money on her other kids.\n\nI highly recommend that you consider asking your nieces if they have anything they need (clothes, toiletries, money on their school cafeteria account, sports or activities fees, costs for diver's education, etc...).  It may be that your niece's needs aren't all being met and that they need some support you aren't aware of.  \n\nAlso, if possible, you might let your nieces know that they could live with you when they're older and you might try to set aside funds to help them with further education.", "NTA", "NTA. Hell no. Why would you repay that treatment with kindness? Enjoy Christmas with the nieces, and let the mother sort it out for the others", "NTA a million times over. Give them to your family.", "Nta. This is entitled behavior.", "Definitely NTA. Your relationship is with your nieces, not their family. \n\nSuggestion though... It might be good to take your nieces out shopping for Christmas gifts they can give to their siblings on Christmas morning. Give them $10 to $20 each and take them to a Dollar Store. Perhaps even get a couple of small presents for your nieces too so that they can something to open on Christmas or to give to each other. \n\nI admit I love Christmas and hate to see anyone, who celebrates it, not able to get the joy and excitement from it: so that's 1 reason for the suggestion. They other is that doing this will foster the bonds that you have with your siblings and their father.", "NTA. Also INFO: Are your nieces in a tense household? Have their mother and step father pressured them to get you to consider their half siblings as their own? Also your nieces are old enough to pursue a relationship with you without their mother getting more in the way than she already has. Morally or ethically alone you don't owe her other children anything, but the fact you had to go to court to be in your nieces' life is a clear sign that you should have as little to do with their mother as possible. I hope you didn't have to pay too much for court...", "NTA... Does her new man not have any family on his side? Why do his kids fall on your shoulders?", "You and your brother's wife both sound like absolute nightmares.  You don't get along with your brother's wife so when he dies instead of both of you doing what's best for his kids, you turn it into a fucking court battle.  You've made no efforts to try to integrated with the rest of your nieces' family.  Their mom tried, again, to keep you out of their lives.  Just awful all around.  ESH.", "NTA.. Personally, I'd have tried to include them but.. She made it clear she didn't want you in the girls lives then they moaned ud ignore any others b4 they even existed and tried to kick u out again! They're made it super difficult for u and now they want u to do them favours!\n\nSadly its the kids that are going to be hurt tho.. Idk I'd get the older girls to sneak them something lol could even take them to get their younger siblings something so it's \"from them\" lol.. But u don't have to.. Just if I had that option I would try", "I wouldn't do that. I guarantee the mom is going to do something with the gifts. OP should take the girls out for lunch and give them their gifts herself.", "I agree. NTA. But it wouldn't shock me if the mom throws a fit and steals the girls' gifts out of anger or not to make the younger ones feel bad to see them.", "They have always gotten their stuff directly from me and opened them at my house. That was not going to be changing this year. Their mom still wanted me to send gifts to the other kids though.", "That's how it happens every year. I see them Christmas Eve usually, though sometimes it's a day or two after Christmas Day and I give the girls their gifts at my house and they open them with me.", "I'm guessing she would expect that from him if they had divorced instead of him passing away.", "I turned it into a court battle because she would not let me be in their lives and refused to discuss it with me. No, I don't integrate into the rest of their family because they are not part of my family and after the stuff my brother's wife pulled, I have no more interest in being part of her life. All I care about is my nieces here.", "I like this idea. If that\u2019s an option, I don\u2019t know where they live then I would do this as well.", "Oh i agree mom will probably try to pull some bs but there are ways around that as well. Theres no reason entitled mom should get to win here especially with the background info. Gotta keep a shiny spine with these types of people.", "Maybe just send the small ones nice cards?", "Then I don\u2019t see what the problem is.  Your nieces are old enough that you can tell them not to make a big deal about their gifts so as not to make the younger kids feel bad.", "Maybe take the older girls out and give them a budget to spend on the younger siblings. No, you don\u2019t have to. But Christmas is just better if the kids can have some magic. \n\nYour nieces know their siblings and could pick out things they like. You then could all wrap the presents together. That way you\u2019re spending time with your nieces, but also doing something nice for their loved ones. \n\nDo you really want your nieces to have to see their siblings sad Christmas morning? Especially if you could spend time together making Christmas magic for them?", "NTA. Depending on how your nieces feel, how your finance are and whether money is really tight I might consider giving your nieces money to buy their siblings presents. I used to hate being treated more favourably than my sister (she loved being singled out for special treatment though).", "Nta. Give your nieces whatever you normally would, just don't do it in front of your niece's siblings. You don't owe them or their mother anything.\n\nThat said - and this is completely voluntary - there are 3 young kids who aren't going to be getting much for Christmas. These are kids that are important to your nieces. Maybe talk to your nieces about this. Maybe help them buy gifts for their siblings (you pay, but they pick out and wrap)? To me helping those that have less is an important part of the season and this could be a great way of imparting this to your nieces.", "NTA", "NTA  also I recommend giving your nieces something like a trip to a show with you this year rather than items that can be stolen from them and sold or exchanged for stuff for the younger kids because I would bet money on that happening.", "NTA. Your ex-sil kids aren't your responsibility, neither she treated you in a way to create a relationship with her new kids.", "NTA\n\nThis woman has tried to forcibly remove you from your nieces lives, and now wants to use you financially?\n\nSo long as you are not giving the gifts in front of the other children, this is not your problem", "NTA but I couldn't imagine leaving kids out on Christmas day knowing they're all in one household. It doesn't have to be 50 50 but a gift would go a long way for those children. I think it's more about kindness than rightness.", "NTA but I would be discrete in giving their gifts to them early and not front of the other kids.  \n\nGood for you for being in the nieces\u2019 lives.", "NTA\n\nBut consider getting them personalised gifts with their name literally on it to offset any chance of mum selling them or making them share.", "Absolutely NTA.  I think everyone here has summed it up perfectly.", "You are NTA. You owe the other children nothing. Not your monkeys, not your show. \n\nExSil is trying to use you. How fucking gross.", "NTA, she tried to limit your access to your nieces and now expect you to spend money on all of her kids? Your relatives are the two nieces and your responsibilities are only to that extend. Her other children are outsiders to you and you are not obligated to spend money on them. The other children can get their christmas present from either mom's or dad's side of the family. The mom is the AH for trying to limit your access to your nieces. Don't give in to her demands, she may asks more from you by holding your nieces hostage.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nI mean, if the situation was different, you might have a different opinion on that. But it was her who decided to fight your wants to have a relationship with the girls. It was her who went to court several times to get you out of your nieces' lives. It was her who went to court after she met her husband once again. It was her doing that prevented you from even knowing her younger kids. (I don't say you even wanted a relationship with the youngest ones, but if you had wanted it just because they're you nieces' sibling, she would have prevented it anyways, right?)\n\nBut now, when it suits her, she wants you to be involved. And just with money. Entitled, much, right?", "NTA. She can reach out to her family, she can reach out to her new husbands family, she can reach out to both of their friends, colleagues and she can raise money for a few gifts.\n\nYour duty is to those two young women. You are there representing their father and their father wouldn't be raising or paying for his exes new kids with her new husband.\n\nAlso many people cant afford things - its how you parent - its about experiences, its about explaining.

I would honestly keep it a secret that you gave your nieces a gift and just say you didn't give any gifts for the all of them. They're old enough to understand your situation.\n\nThe mom is TA for even putting you in that situation. If money is tight, gifts are the least of her worries.

She told me I'll be an asshole if I don't.\n\nTell her she's an asshole for asking. \n\nIt's not even that her younger daughters aren't related to you. It's that she's tried to muscle you out, erase your brother from your nieces lives, and now she needs you to step up for her. She's acting entitled to your money, but she doesn't want YOU. And I'd be willing to bet it wouldn't be your name on any presents, but hers and her husband's.", "NTA but if you wanted to be nice (for the kids), you could buy an extra present- a board game or card game or something the whole family could use, and send that back with them.", "I get that Op has no responsibility to care about the other kids but as a mom of course it sucks to see her kids being treated differently so it's not just white or black . He does cause jealousy in her household it's like when I read one kid gets a car and the other one won't .It still sucks for the kids to be treated diffrently", "But is it really sad?\n\nOr is it just basic reality?\n\nEvery kids has to deal with realizing some kids will get better gifts than you. Every kid has to come back from holiday season and realize some kids get more and better gifts. \n\nHell, most kids have to deal with that within their own family. Some cousins will have a rich uncle you don't share. \n\nMy bro had to deal with it with me. No divorces, no separations, 2 biological brothers raised together with the same 2 biological parents, all in the same house. \n\nBut out of 4 godparents, I got the only good one. So every bday, every xmas, there was always one extra box for me. And it was always something great, and usually expensive. \n\nAnd you know what?

It's called Karma.", "Info: It may suck but how is it, it the OP's responsibility or the OP's fault?  How does it cause jealousy?  The kids lost their father, and their relative is the only link to their bio dad\n\nShe cant have it all ways.  She made it hard for visitation, making it so he had to go through the courts.  This will always happen in blended families, and it's nearly impossible to stop.", "It sucks for sure but that's just life. Here, a mom is worried about her kids getting equal presents. Somewhere else, a mom worries about how to split food rations among her hungry children. But it's better that kids understand that there are differences instead of giving the false reality that everything will forever be equal.", ">It still sucks for the kids to be treated diffrently\n\nbut, why doesn't their mother simply talk to the elder girls and mention that as they're getting older and their uncle will get *them* good Xmas gifts, she's going to spend more money on the little ones and will only get them small gifts?", "I never expected or even asked for the same treatment.", "Imho, a nice group gift - a board game they could play together, or some really nice snacks (or snacks with assembly like smores or cookie decorating) sent home w the older ones to share would be a nice gesture for under 20$.", "Look you know well that you are not the NTA here and you don't owe those lids anything.

She's tried to make things difficult every step of the way and now wants to stick her hand out and ask him to \"think of the children\"! How greedy of her! OP is NTA, and sir, you are wonderful to care for your brother's kids for so long and put so much effort into the relationship. This woman has a husband and at sometime during this whole frickin year, they could have saved something for their own kids.

If anyone ever tried to keep her kids away, there will be hell to pay.", "I understand your point.\n\nTo give you an idea where I'm coming from, in my family Xmas is more aimed at the younger kids, so the older we got, my parents always made it clear that gifts were supposed to be less important.\n\nNow the big people do a Secret Santa while all the kids get gifts and the gifts for the big people are supposed to cost less than 30 Euro.", "Wow have you never had financial difficulties?  And you want to take their kids away. Wow!  Doesn\u2019t sound like they are homeless living out of a car or in the streets. I understand that the 2 oldest have more opportunities and it sounds to me like they are old enough to have a conversation with OP to see if some of the money can be spent on the other 2. Also OP could help the parents find resources to help them out. No one needs to be the bad guy and you don\u2019t get to have kids taken away from someone because they are having a difficult time."]}
