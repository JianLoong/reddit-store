Their mom and I were never close. She and I butted heads while my brother was alive and she didn't want me around once he was gone. But the fact my brother was gone and I was the last piece of his family, two judges (because she appealed the first decision) agreed that maintaining a relationship with me was in the best interest of the girls. We got along a little better for a while once the dust had settled but then she started dating her husband and he had problems with the fact the girls would always have me while any children they would have in the future would not have me and I was the most active person in any extended family they could claim. So bad blood returned.\n\nI have never wanted or looked to pursue a relationship with the younger half siblings my nieces have. They have three. Who are all under the age of 10 currently. I have met them a handful of times. But that's about it.\n\nThe girls' mom did try to use her younger kids as a reason to end my visitation rights to the girls but that failed because the judge told her many blended families deal with dynamics like this and do not find it harmful.\n\nNow both the girls are older and the relationship is more of an independent one. They can call and text me whenever they like and will invite me to stuff without going through their mom. It's so much better. Though I still know she's their mom and could make things more difficult outside the court ordered access if she wanted to.\n\nThis past year has been tough on the household financially. The girls have told me about it and now, their mom has told me they are not going to be able to do anything nice regarding presents for any of the kids, and she asked me to split the money I spend on the girls every year between all the kids. She said it would be the right thing to do because her younger kids are aware the girls get gifts from me every year and it would suck for them to get nothing they'll enjoy while the girls still get nice stuff.\n\nI said no. I said my responsibility was to the girls and not her other kids.

Regarding xmas gifts, I don't get why people who have blended families think its ok, to tell people who they can give gifts to, when they are no relations.\n\nGive your nieces there gifts separately and without the parents knowing.  Not your problem their household budgets are getting tight, and donating to the \"mutual fund\" of presents", "NTA and I think it's admirable that you have jumped through so many legal hoops to keep a relationship with your brother's children. Your ex sister-in-law's inability to care for her additional children is not your problem and for her to try to guilt you into giving them gifts makes her TA.", "Yeah no NTA. After all she\u2019s put you through she wants you to support her children? Would probably have been very different had she acted like a human. She\u2019s likely cost you thousands. \n\nAlso, not your circus not your monkeys. Her request is ridiculous and I don\u2019t even believe what she\u2019s saying.

You have no relationship or ties to your former sister-in-law\u2019s children. After the way she\u2019s treated you, I can\u2019t believe she would even ask you to do this. The sense of entitlement from people today blows my mind. As a kid, I had an older half brother and sister who got things, trips, and presents that I did not. When my parents said, \u201cThat is from their Mom\u2019s family.\u201d, I never expected or even asked for the same treatment. \n\nYou won\u2019t even be there on Christmas morning to make a big show of it.

I\u2019d take them out to lunch or dinner to give the presents and ask them not to brag about the presents in front of their siblings. I\u2019d also send them home with small, inexpensive presents for all the siblings (including your nieces) to open together. This is not your family, but this is your nieces\u2019 family and you represent your side of it.  \n\nIt\u2019s not your job to appease the mother. It\u2019s also not your job to cause any more friction than you have to.", "NTA \u2014 She had no right to ask, and you had every right to refuse.  However, the half-siblings are just kids, and it does seem sad that they will have to watch the older sisters get nice things while they don\u2019t. And your nieces may feel a little bad about it.\n\nWould it be possible to give your nieces their gifts quietly, in a way that the younger kids don\u2019t notice the difference so much?  If all presents go under the tree, can you pack two things into one box so that your nieces don\u2019t have many more packages to open than the younger ones? \n\nI don\u2019t think you should give presents to the kids because it could easily become an expectation for future years, but maybe there could be a present to your nieces that they could enjoy with their siblings?

There's no reason this woman should expect to spend your money on her other kids.\n\nI highly recommend that you consider asking your nieces if they have anything they need (clothes, toiletries, money on their school cafeteria account, sports or activities fees, costs for diver's education, etc...).  It may be that your niece's needs aren't all being met and that they need some support you aren't aware of.  \n\nAlso, if possible, you might let your nieces know that they could live with you when they're older and you might try to set aside funds to help them with further education.", "NTA", "NTA. Hell no. Why would you repay that treatment with kindness? Enjoy Christmas with the nieces, and let the mother sort it out for the others", "NTA a million times over. Give them to your family.", "Nta. This is entitled behavior.", "Definitely NTA. Your relationship is with your nieces, not their family. \n\nSuggestion though... It might be good to take your nieces out shopping for Christmas gifts they can give to their siblings on Christmas morning. Give them $10 to $20 each and take them to a Dollar Store. Perhaps even get a couple of small presents for your nieces too so that they can something to open on Christmas or to give to each other. \n\nI admit I love Christmas and hate to see anyone, who celebrates it, not able to get the joy and excitement from it: so that's 1 reason for the suggestion. They other is that doing this will foster the bonds that you have with your siblings and their father.", "NTA. Also INFO: Are your nieces in a tense household? Have their mother and step father pressured them to get you to consider their half siblings as their own? Also your nieces are old enough to pursue a relationship with you without their mother getting more in the way than she already has. Morally or ethically alone you don't owe her other children anything, but the fact you had to go to court to be in your nieces' life is a clear sign that you should have as little to do with their mother as possible.

Why do his kids fall on your shoulders?", "You and your brother's wife both sound like absolute nightmares.  You don't get along with your brother's wife so when he dies instead of both of you doing what's best for his kids, you turn it into a fucking court battle.

Personally, I'd have tried to include them but.. She made it clear she didn't want you in the girls lives then they moaned ud ignore any others b4 they even existed and tried to kick u out again! They're made it super difficult for u and now they want u to do them favours!\n\nSadly its the kids that are going to be hurt tho.. Idk I'd get the older girls to sneak them something lol could even take them to get their younger siblings something so it's \"from them\" lol.. But u don't have to.. Just if I had that option I would try", "I wouldn't do that. I guarantee the mom is going to do something with the gifts.

That was not going to be changing this year. Their mom still wanted me to send gifts to the other kids though.", "That's how it happens every year. I see them Christmas Eve usually, though sometimes it's a day or two after Christmas Day and I give the girls their gifts at my house and they open them with me.", "I'm guessing she would expect that from him if they had divorced instead of him passing away.", "I turned it into a court battle because she would not let me be in their lives and refused to discuss it with me. No, I don't integrate into the rest of their family because they are not part of my family and after the stuff my brother's wife pulled, I have no more interest in being part of her life. All I care about is my nieces here.", "I like this idea. If that\u2019s an option, I don\u2019t know where they live then I would do this as well.", "Oh i agree mom will probably try to pull some bs but there are ways around that as well. Theres no reason entitled mom should get to win here especially with the background info. Gotta keep a shiny spine with these types of people.", "Maybe just send the small ones nice cards?", "Then I don\u2019t see what the problem is.

No, you don\u2019t have to. But Christmas is just better if the kids can have some magic. \n\nYour nieces know their siblings and could pick out things they like. You then could all wrap the presents together. That way you\u2019re spending time with your nieces, but also doing something nice for their loved ones. \n\nDo you really want your nieces to have to see their siblings sad Christmas morning? Especially if you could spend time together making Christmas magic for them?", "NTA. Depending on how your nieces feel, how your finance are and whether money is really tight I might consider giving your nieces money to buy their siblings presents.

You don't owe them or their mother anything.\n\nThat said - and this is completely voluntary - there are 3 young kids who aren't going to be getting much for Christmas. These are kids that are important to your nieces. Maybe talk to your nieces about this. Maybe help them buy gifts for their siblings (you pay, but they pick out and wrap)? To me helping those that have less is an important part of the season and this could be a great way of imparting this to your nieces.", "NTA", "NTA  also I recommend giving your nieces something like a trip to a show with you this year rather than items that can be stolen from them and sold or exchanged for stuff for the younger kids because I would bet money on that happening.", "NTA.

It doesn't have to be 50 50 but a gift would go a long way for those children. I think it's more about kindness than rightness.", "NTA but I would be discrete in giving their gifts to them early and not front of the other kids.  \n\nGood for you for being in the nieces\u2019 lives.", "NTA\n\nBut consider getting them personalised gifts with their name literally on it to offset any chance of mum selling them or making them share.", "Absolutely NTA.

How fucking gross.", "NTA, she tried to limit your access to your nieces and now expect you to spend money on all of her kids? Your relatives are the two nieces and your responsibilities are only to that extend. Her other children are outsiders to you and you are not obligated to spend money on them.

But it was her who decided to fight your wants to have a relationship with the girls. It was her who went to court several times to get you out of your nieces' lives.

She can reach out to her family, she can reach out to her new husbands family, she can reach out to both of their friends, colleagues and she can raise money for a few gifts.\n\nYour duty is to those two young women.

Like there are so many factors. But. Also forcing them to say 'I love you' and actually bond is 100% going too far, just don't exclude them or rub their nose in the differences.", "but it is.

Something small they would like from their older sisters. Set a small budget and help them shop and wrap. If you can swing it financially it would be a kind thing to do.

Let them be the heroes. Maybe explain the spirit of Christmas and giving and all and let them make decision with your help. They are going to feel the wrath if they come home with nothing. And you are also teaching them about giving and sharing in the holiday spirit. You will be the bigger person in this instance and they will remember that.

It's the fact that it was done so blatantly that bothered me.", "Agreed.", "Like. If you're all going to be at the same event at least acknowledge them. I'll use Christmas as an example since it's easier to reference using a specific Holliday or event - obvs not every fam does Christmas. If it's like two different Christmases, it's no big deal. If it's one big Christmas with where both sets of step parents are there no big deal. But say one parent had Christmas another a different holiday. It's not fair for that child to sit at their step grandparents house and not get at least something- no it doesn't have to be extravagant it's mainly about showing that you do know they exist and don't want them to be excluded. It's mainly only an issue imo in families where the child lives fully with one parent but the people in their life still treat them like they're just part time. Or situations like that where they aren't getting two of things because of how parents have divided things. But. Thats just my opinion based on things I've seen. I don't think anyone should be forced to develop a bond with someone, and depending on economical situations of families some half sibs, or step sibs will naturally get more - but I also don't think a child should be made to feel left out in a situation they didn't create.

If I were in OP\u2019s shoes, I\u2019d offer my nieces if they would like a little extra money to buy something better for their siblings than whatever they were going to get them.   I\u2019d see this as a gift to the nieces that would also give pleasure to the younger kids.  But that\u2019s just me.  Blended families are tricky.", "From the post I got it was the sil that took op to court to stop op getting any contact", "Actually the stepparent's family can step up and is okay to ask them. But to ask the relatives of the other child's parent who has no connection to the step child is not okay.", "NTA\n\nShe wanted you out of the family so she can't complain to you! She should've thought about that before trying to cut you off!", "Op has never given them their gifts in front of them op gives them their gifts and they open them at ops house", "It\u2019s not the same story that story the stepdad had only 2 kids this one stepdad has 3 it does sound similar tho but 2 different storys", "Op could you not open an account for them in their names and put the money you spend into the accounts and just let your nieces now what you are doing. It\u2019s just an idea I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s feasible", "Oh, that\u2019s even better!\n\nPlay the high ground.", "It doesn\u2019t, but it\u2019s a thing people do: you acknowledge kids in your social circle even if you\u2019re not close to them, and you spend a few bucks to make them happy.", "No he won\u2019t once they are adults and moved out of their parents house op won\u2019t have any reason to stay in contact with ah ex sil", "So why should the nieces suffer for their mum and stepdad money problems if they are really having any problems at all sounds like mum is just trying to extort money from op", "Not everyone does tho op does even see them as her nieces goes to her house", "Did you read the comment right or jumped some parts she didn\u2019t say she would do it she said she would be thinking of it if they did to her what sil did to op", "Yes I agree plus if op did what those people say what do they think the mum and dad would say then that would probably cause more trouble."]}
