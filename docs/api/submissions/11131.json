We are going on a cruise tomorrow and decided to vacation in the departure city for a few days before the ship leaves. Yesterday, we went to an amusement park and things were going fine until lunch.\n\nMy sister Laura (33F) has 7 kids (14M, 13M, 11F, 9F, 7M, 5M + 3F) with her husband (33M). Her oldest son, Jude, is openly gay, he is very feminine and stereotypically gay, we don\u2019t have an issue with that. However, Jude tends to use his sexuality to excuse bad behavior, most notably his pretty blatant misogyny. Most of Jude\u2019s friends are girls and I\u2019ve overheard him + his friends \u201cslut shame\u201d girls in his grade before. My sister\u2019s 13 year old, Heston, has complete opposite interests, he\u2019s the sporty one, as far as I know he hasn\u2019t said anything wrong or bigoted, he\u2019s a nice kid. Heston is also starting to talk more + more about the girls he likes. Heston was showing some photos of girls he likes to the table while we were at lunch/ Jude saw the girls and he kept making remarks on what the girls were wearing including calling them sexist names, mocking the girls for their hobbies such as sports, and mocking the weights of them. I tried telling him to stop a few times and he wouldn\u2019t, saying that I was only \u201coffended because it was true\u201d. The final straw for me is when he told Heston to stop \u201cbeing a pussy\u201d when he was getting visibly upset, I pulled Laura aside to talk to her and when I did she said Jude couldn\u2019t be sexist because he was gay and how his friends have said he\u2019s \u201cbasically one of the girls\u201d. \n\nAs soon as lunch was over, I told my family that I needed a break and we went to a different part of the park for the rest of the day. I specifically told the table it was because Jude was being disgusting and I asked him if he was this much of a bully at school. When we got back to the hotel, a few of my siblings, including Laura, started to argue with me about if what I did was ok, they said that I was in the wrong both for breaking off and for the comments I made to Jude. Laura continued to defend Jude, saying he was a good kid who was just voicing his own views, and some of our siblings agreed with her, but some were saying I was in the right and Jude went too far. Later that night, Heston came in our room and thanked me, saying he wishes he spoke up and then asked me for some advice on girls. Laura is also mad that I gave him advice on girls, but he\u2019s a sweet kid and I know any girl would be lucky to have him. Laura said it was \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to her authority.

I was at the amusement park with my family and we went to lunch, at the lunch, one of my nephew's kept making sexist remarks about the girls his younger brother liked, the older one used his sexuality to excuse the behavior. I decided to tell him off and then break off from the rest of my family for the day.\n\n2. Some of my siblings are calling me petty and saying that I shouldn't have told my nephew off, but his younger brother thanked me for standing up for him/his crushes and I am wonderin if I am in  the wrong.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I wouldn't want to hang around him either", "NTA. His mom is enabling him and it\u2019ll just get worse.", "NTA.  Laura's he can't be X because he's Y argument is asinine and enabling of bad behavior.  Whether you call it toxic misogyny or being a mean girl, either way Jude was being an AH.\n\nSadly anyone, regardless of gender, orientation, race, class, social status, etc can be an AH.  That Jude happens to be gay does not excuse their behavior.", "NTA\n\nHis sexuality doesn't give him the right to be a bully. His parents should be the ones addressing this behavior and taking issue with it... not you. It's sad that parents allow this behavior. Body shaming and bullying are disgusting regardless of what age, race, gender, sexuality, or religion that person is.", "NTA, and well done, I'd say. You objected to the bullying/misogyny in the moment, identified it publicly, and protected your family from it by removing yourselves. \n\nLaura has two problems. \n\nOne of them is Jude's behaviour, which needs to be corrected before he hurts more people. As an old fag, bitchy queen can be fun but it doesn't have to be mean, and RuPaul's a crap mentor in this regard. \n\nThe other is her own perception of what behaviour is acceptable towards women. If she wouldn't accept a comment from a male stranger (or that comment wouldn't be generally acceptable) it's not acceptable when Jude utters it. \n\nI do hope she comes to her senses. Jude isn't cute or funny in this. Just destructive, and sooner or later, that will hurt him the most. He'll have no friends who trust that he won't harm them in some way with his comments.", "Nta. Bullies come in all forms, and you are never wrong for calling one out. Nor their enablers\u2026", "NTA\n\nSome of the worst sexists ain't heterosexual.\n\nIf your sister thinks this behaviour of her son is in any way appropriate, she'll have to live with the consequences. She should get comfortable with the idea of her son living at her place for a long time, cause I can already see HR complaints successfully filed against him.", "Nope. NTA.\n\nI loathe bullies. My flaming gay guy friends never acted like that or talked about others like that. Sexuality has nothing to do with being a complete AH bully to others.\n\nGood on you for calling it out!!!", "NTA. Jude thinks it\u2019s cute to put people down. It\u2019s sad how his mother enables him. As for Heston and her jealousy that he came up to you for advice, there\u2019s a reason for that. It\u2019s all very sticky, good luck trying to be fair and supportive without pissing anybody off. \n\nYou could try writing down all of Jude\u2019s nasty comments for a while. Seeing them in black and white might make her see how distasteful they really are, but this is risky and might be seen as petty.", "Being gay does not mean you are part of the girls :)))\n\nHis entire crowd is messed up and the fact that his parents indulge and even support his behaviour is beyond worrying.\n\nNTA, you don't have to listen to any misogynistic comments. And your sister shall not be \"upset over you stealing her authority\", because as it turns out, she doesn't go well in raising empathetic, mature human beings.", "NTA...No sexuality gives anyone a license to behave that inappropriately. This kid is going to be in for a rough ride when he says these things at a job or other formal situations.", "NTA - Jude is an AH who is being enabled by his mom.", "NTA\n\nYour nephew is a bully and the family is allowing it and making excuses for it.  His being gay has nothing to do with it, he is a bully.", "Next time you break off, take Heston with you.  NTA", "NTA. Jude is a bully and his mom is blind to it.", "NTA\n\n\nSaying Jude can't be sexist because he's gay is like saying black people can't be racist... \n\n\nKeep an eye on Heston. I have the feeling he needs someone...", "You where just \"voicing your own viewes\"\nNta.", "Being gay doesn't magically make you not a mysogist. Someone making rude, hurtful comments about another person isn't okay and shouldn't be excused or condoned. When your nephew starts saying these things to the various female identifying individuals in his family, is it going to be okay because they're hus family? (Assuming he isn't already when adults aren't around.) \n\nI'd like to think the answer would be \"Of course not\" but I suspect your sister will instead have some other excuse to enable this behavior.", "NTA Thank god someone calls out the kid for his shit behavior", "Nta. A lot of gay guys are rude tbh. They claim they\u2019re \u201cplayful\u201d and \u201chonest\u201d but I\u2019ve seen them really play out mean girls in real life\u2026 I\u2019m transgender and the most hate and bad looks I get are from lesbians and gays who suck up to the mean girls/boys straight people who will never want them. They think it\u2019s cute being mean to others and most likely bullied themselves. They are catty and love to gossip about others lives. I\u2019ve met like one that wasn\u2019t like that and he\u2019s deaf.", "I see this as a kid trying to fit in. Being a member of the 'mean girls' club is an ego boost. Someone needs to let him know that that is no way to treat others. NTA. Thank you for standing up for your nephew and being there for him", "NTa and you need to say a lot more to that shitty little child.", "NTA\n\nJude is shaping up to be a nasty little sh*t. His parents need to teach him better whilst he is young enough to learn.", "Definitely NTA. That is horrible behavior and I wouldn't want to be near it either, nor anyone who supported it. Frankly I think it's awesome that Heston was able to recognize what you did for him and to come thank you and I'm so glad he was able to ask you for advice. It sounds like he needs real adult support while he's at a confusing age, so I encourage you to keep loving on him and mentoring him. It's healthy for kids to have adult mentors outside of their parents, especially during their teen years, and it's a downright necessity if their parents are as unsupportive as your sister. So don't take your sister's comments about you overstepping her authority to heart. Helping Heston develop in a healthy and loving manner is more important than avoiding offending someone whose priorities are so skewed. \n\nGood luck on the rest of your vacation...", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
