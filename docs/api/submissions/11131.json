We are going on a cruise tomorrow and decided to vacation in the departure city for a few days before the ship leaves. Yesterday, we went to an amusement park and things were going fine until lunch.\n\nMy sister Laura (33F) has 7 kids (14M, 13M, 11F, 9F, 7M, 5M + 3F) with her husband (33M). Her oldest son, Jude, is openly gay, he is very feminine and stereotypically gay, we don\u2019t have an issue with that. However, Jude tends to use his sexuality to excuse bad behavior, most notably his pretty blatant misogyny. Most of Jude\u2019s friends are girls and I\u2019ve overheard him + his friends \u201cslut shame\u201d girls in his grade before. My sister\u2019s 13 year old, Heston, has complete opposite interests, he\u2019s the sporty one, as far as I know he hasn\u2019t said anything wrong or bigoted, he\u2019s a nice kid. Heston is also starting to talk more + more about the girls he likes. Heston was showing some photos of girls he likes to the table while we were at lunch/ Jude saw the girls and he kept making remarks on what the girls were wearing including calling them sexist names, mocking the girls for their hobbies such as sports, and mocking the weights of them. I tried telling him to stop a few times and he wouldn\u2019t, saying that I was only \u201coffended because it was true\u201d. The final straw for me is when he told Heston to stop \u201cbeing a pussy\u201d when he was getting visibly upset, I pulled Laura aside to talk to her and when I did she said Jude couldn\u2019t be sexist because he was gay and how his friends have said he\u2019s \u201cbasically one of the girls\u201d. \n\nAs soon as lunch was over, I told my family that I needed a break and we went to a different part of the park for the rest of the day. I specifically told the table it was because Jude was being disgusting and I asked him if he was this much of a bully at school. When we got back to the hotel, a few of my siblings, including Laura, started to argue with me about if what I did was ok, they said that I was in the wrong both for breaking off and for the comments I made to Jude. Laura continued to defend Jude, saying he was a good kid who was just voicing his own views, and some of our siblings agreed with her, but some were saying I was in the right and Jude went too far. Later that night, Heston came in our room and thanked me, saying he wishes he spoke up and then asked me for some advice on girls. Laura is also mad that I gave him advice on girls, but he\u2019s a sweet kid and I know any girl would be lucky to have him. Laura said it was \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to her authority.

Frankly I think it's awesome that Heston was able to recognize what you did for him and to come thank you and I'm so glad he was able to ask you for advice. It sounds like he needs real adult support while he's at a confusing age, so I encourage you to keep loving on him and mentoring him. It's healthy for kids to have adult mentors outside of their parents, especially during their teen years, and it's a downright necessity if their parents are as unsupportive as your sister. So don't take your sister's comments about you overstepping her authority to heart. Helping Heston develop in a healthy and loving manner is more important than avoiding offending someone whose priorities are so skewed. \n\nGood luck on the rest of your vacation...", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Jude is trying to justify making really hurtful, rude comments about these girls. I say this as someone with a bestie that is definitely one of the girls, using his sexuality to justify hurting someone is bullying. \n\nNTA, OP. Let your nephew know he can hang out with you guys for this trip if his family isn\u2019t going to be kind to him.", "This is the perfect answer. \n\nNTA, OP.", "Jude sounds deeply insecure, manifesting as a mean girl. As a gay man, I think he's in for a rude awakening as he tries to date/socialize with men. That sort of bullying doesn't land well in a marginalized community. NTA.", "Ugh and this isn\u2019t \u201cstereotypically gay\u201d it\u2019s gross bullying behavior. I can honestly say I have more gay friends than straight and none of them speak like this and the younger generation (younger cousins) are the exact opposite of this kid\u2014the kindest kids who advocate for everyone. This kids going to have a tough time later on and he deserves it.\n\nAlso what is happening on Reddit every post is like I\u2019m 24 and my 7 kids are 35, 40, 15 and 6. Like when are you ppl having kids, 2?", "They can easily be AH to their own demographic, too. Plenty of internalized misogyny, racism, homophobia to go around. Being \u201cone of the girls\u201d doesn\u2019t make him immune to being misogynistic, even if he _literally were a girl_.", "This made me think of an episode of Big Mouth where Matthew meets and older, sassier gay man who, as you said, calls him out for it.\n\nNTA op", "Really? That is what you took from all this?", "I wish your comment were more true. Most lgbtqia people aren\u2019t assholes, but there\u2019s still a ton of biphobia, transphobia, racism, ableism, and misogyny throughout the community.", "One of the most openly misogynistic men I\u2019ve ever known in my life is a gay man in this 30s that I\u2019m in a therapy group with. He admitted he hates women because we \u201cget the men that he wants to be sleeping with.\u201c He\u2019s also a virgin and blames women somehow.", "Also the things he's saying aren't ok for girls to say either, like we should all strive to lift each other, not tear down.", "Gay men are also notoriously mysoginistic towards women, idk where he can be \"one of the girls\" if he's talking like that to any girl.", "I've known some pretty misogynist gay men.  They are just like straight men, but with the mask off because they don't feel obligated to make women not hate them - they aren't sexually attracted to women, therefore women are useless to them and don't have any value, plus they can say whatever to whomever and they don't lose any dates for it.  I wish I could say that every oppressed group is always an ally to every other oppressed group, but that would be 100% a lie.", "Nor am I foolish enough to try and make that claim, ever. I've watched gay men throw parts of the community under the bus many times in 40 years of being out. I've also watched parts of the community supporting each other whole-heartedly. \n\nI call out misogyny when I see it. Many years ago, I wouldn't have seen it at all, and I'm still learning its forms. I believe the more we call it out, the more effectively we can all unlearn it. Mind, I feel the same way about being out: visibility breeds familiarity and ease, not contempt.", "So if you have a family with 7 kids and one of them is gay and an AH, your reasoning is the latter is related to the former? How come the other 6 kids are not AH? I think people sometimes excuse AH behavior because the AH identifies as a minority. What's worse than calling out an AH? Being labeled a homophobe. This is enabling.", "Oh, of course not! Nothing of our behaviour is related to our experiences in life. /s\n\nI noted family, friends, and media, not simply family.", "We are all surrounded by media. And most teenagers are very susceptible to peer pressure. This is why it's super important for the parents to show the way. To me it's clear the parents in this case are either unwilling or unable. Doesn't matter though, the result is the same. And sometimes even then, if the parents do show the way, it's of no use. Some people are just default AH and that's it. I do hope this kid is just confused and still learning."]}
