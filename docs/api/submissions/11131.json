We are going on a cruise tomorrow and decided to vacation in the departure city for a few days before the ship leaves. Yesterday, we went to an amusement park and things were going fine until lunch.\n\nMy sister Laura (33F) has 7 kids (14M, 13M, 11F, 9F, 7M, 5M + 3F) with her husband (33M). Her oldest son, Jude, is openly gay, he is very feminine and stereotypically gay, we don\u2019t have an issue with that. However, Jude tends to use his sexuality to excuse bad behavior, most notably his pretty blatant misogyny. Most of Jude\u2019s friends are girls and I\u2019ve overheard him + his friends \u201cslut shame\u201d girls in his grade before. My sister\u2019s 13 year old, Heston, has complete opposite interests, he\u2019s the sporty one, as far as I know he hasn\u2019t said anything wrong or bigoted, he\u2019s a nice kid. Heston is also starting to talk more + more about the girls he likes. Heston was showing some photos of girls he likes to the table while we were at lunch/ Jude saw the girls and he kept making remarks on what the girls were wearing including calling them sexist names, mocking the girls for their hobbies such as sports, and mocking the weights of them. I tried telling him to stop a few times and he wouldn\u2019t, saying that I was only \u201coffended because it was true\u201d. The final straw for me is when he told Heston to stop \u201cbeing a pussy\u201d when he was getting visibly upset, I pulled Laura aside to talk to her and when I did she said Jude couldn\u2019t be sexist because he was gay and how his friends have said he\u2019s \u201cbasically one of the girls\u201d. \n\nAs soon as lunch was over, I told my family that I needed a break and we went to a different part of the park for the rest of the day. I specifically told the table it was because Jude was being disgusting and I asked him if he was this much of a bully at school. When we got back to the hotel, a few of my siblings, including Laura, started to argue with me about if what I did was ok, they said that I was in the wrong both for breaking off and for the comments I made to Jude. Laura continued to defend Jude, saying he was a good kid who was just voicing his own views, and some of our siblings agreed with her, but some were saying I was in the right and Jude went too far. Later that night, Heston came in our room and thanked me, saying he wishes he spoke up and then asked me for some advice on girls. Laura is also mad that I gave him advice on girls, but he\u2019s a sweet kid and I know any girl would be lucky to have him. Laura said it was \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to her authority.

Frankly I think it's awesome that Heston was able to recognize what you did for him and to come thank you and I'm so glad he was able to ask you for advice. It sounds like he needs real adult support while he's at a confusing age, so I encourage you to keep loving on him and mentoring him. It's healthy for kids to have adult mentors outside of their parents, especially during their teen years, and it's a downright necessity if their parents are as unsupportive as your sister. So don't take your sister's comments about you overstepping her authority to heart. Helping Heston develop in a healthy and loving manner is more important than avoiding offending someone whose priorities are so skewed. \n\nGood luck on the rest of your vacation...", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You might be the only one to call him out and let him know he is a bully. Great job.", "Gay people can be shitty stupid assholes too.", "NTA. As someone part of the LGBTQ+ community, there are definitely some problematic parts of it. One thing that there's been a lot of discourse on recently is the fact that a lot of cis gay men (especially white ones) are blatant misogynists. It seems they think that being \"one of the girls\" gives them the justification to make wildly offensive remarks about women. But really even if they were women, it doesn't make those comments any less misogynistic. Misogyny is still misogyny no matter what gender and/or sexuality the person making the comment is.", "NTA\n\nI applaud you for standing up for what's right and doing so in a respectful but decisive manner. Additionally, boy or not, gay or not, \"slut shaming\" someone is wrong. There's no way around it.", "NTA\n\nAnd WTF? Some of the most misogynistic pigs I've ever met have been gay men. They were gropey AF too. Apparently it's \"ok\" because they're \"one of the girls\".\n\nHeston seems like a good kid, though.", "NTA", "100% the right answer. OP, NTA. And tell Laura her son is also feeding into the minds of the younger kids too. I surely wouldn\u2019t want any 3 year old of mine listening to what their older brother is saying and them repeating it", "NTA.  No matter who you are, you\u2019re capable of bigotry and hatred.  Being gay is a trait you\u2019re born with.  Hate is an action you practice.  The two are not mutually exclusive", "Pretty sure they were referring to Black people being racist to Black people, which is internalized racism and absolutely a thing. Just like women can be misogynistic, queer folks can be homophobic/queerphobic, disabled people can be ableist. We all internalize societal systems of oppression even if we're part of that oppressed group.", "I also found this weird. How did that even start? \n\n\u201cBy the way family, here are the tween hotties I\u2019ve got my eye on.\u201d", "The number of times this has happened to my wife is WILD. Guys at a gay bar will just grab her boobs/butt without so much as a hello first.

Because women as a whole (apparently including asexual, lesbian,", "I'm sorry I offended you, Luprand.  Really sorry.  \n\nDuring the 70's and 80's I lived in an area that was very gay friendly.  As a lesbian, I was happy with that and had lots of gay men as friends along with lesbian and straight folk.  It's an understatement to say that the gay men's community was sex positive.  It seemed like getting laid was easy for gay men, but establishing a trusting relationship was harder.\n\nIt's out of these memories that my comment was made.  \n\nI had my own time of being single, so I know that place of feeling lonely and wondering why I couldn't find a partner.  I did not mean to belittle that place for anyone, 'cuz those feelings are tough.  \n\nYou communicate with openness and honesty.  You didn't even blame me for a comment that hurt you.  That is 180 degrees opposite of typical incel behavior.\n\nAgain, I apologize, because this old lesbian got it wrong.  I wish you the best on your journey.", "It's all right. I wish you the best on yours.", "NTA.  This is so stupid.  What if Jude were Heston's sister?  Wouldn't everyone say, \"ugh, what an awful, mean girl, we better curb this\"?\n\nSympathy for your child's marginalized identity shouldn't turn into a free pass for them to be a little asshole, and women can be misogynistic, gay men certainly can.  Hating women and girls is a game the whole family can play.", "Omg NTA. Gay people can be sexist too. Even straight women can be sexist. It\u2019s a cultural problem based in patriarchal culture, not a man vs women thing.", "So NTAH!! Gay or not, that boy has ZERO right to talk about girls that way. Sounds like he is trying too hard to be accepted as \u201cone of the guys\u201d and that bullying his little brother is a favorite pass-time of his. Your sister should be appalled at how she is raising her child. If my oldest were to talk like that, especially when with family, I would take him by his ear and wash his mouth out with soap. That\u2019s DISGUSTING behavior to allow to happen. Can\u2019t be misogyny because he\u2019s gay. Has she met anyone who is an adult and openly gay? Not all of them are nice and sweet and \u201cYAS Queen!!\u201d Some of them truly HATE the opposite sex.

You guys need to learn to use it, or your husbands need to learn to give your uterus' a rest.", "Jude's behaviour is nothing to do with his sexuality. He sounds like just a very nasty person. Were he female some people would call him a 'bitch.'

Sexuality is not an aegis for his behaviour. NTA", "NTA. Also his friends saying \u201che\u2019s basically one of the girls\u201d does not give him license to slut shame and put girls/women down. Even if he were to identify as a woman, that\u2019s not how it works and this behavior shouldn\u2019t be allowed or excused.", "NTA and I can't stand people like your sister. They pretty much enable bullies to do whatever they want. It sounds like they're treating his sexuality like an illness and obviously using it to excuse his horrid behavior.

As a lesbian who has been part of the community for 30 years, I have know FAR TOO MANY gay men who get away with saying the most disgusting, vile things about women. They do it for attention and I think they also do it because they can just pass it off as \"Oh, he's just that quirky gay guy... he's harmless, though!\" and for some reason, some women fawn all over them and laugh at them like they're just hilarious. It really pisses me off, and they NEED to be corrected. You were in the right to call him out for it.
