We are going on a cruise tomorrow and decided to vacation in the departure city for a few days before the ship leaves. Yesterday, we went to an amusement park and things were going fine until lunch.\n\nMy sister Laura (33F) has 7 kids (14M, 13M, 11F, 9F, 7M, 5M + 3F) with her husband (33M). Her oldest son, Jude, is openly gay, he is very feminine and stereotypically gay, we don\u2019t have an issue with that. However, Jude tends to use his sexuality to excuse bad behavior, most notably his pretty blatant misogyny. Most of Jude\u2019s friends are girls and I\u2019ve overheard him + his friends \u201cslut shame\u201d girls in his grade before. My sister\u2019s 13 year old, Heston, has complete opposite interests, he\u2019s the sporty one, as far as I know he hasn\u2019t said anything wrong or bigoted, he\u2019s a nice kid. Heston is also starting to talk more + more about the girls he likes. Heston was showing some photos of girls he likes to the table while we were at lunch/ Jude saw the girls and he kept making remarks on what the girls were wearing including calling them sexist names, mocking the girls for their hobbies such as sports, and mocking the weights of them. I tried telling him to stop a few times and he wouldn\u2019t, saying that I was only \u201coffended because it was true\u201d. The final straw for me is when he told Heston to stop \u201cbeing a pussy\u201d when he was getting visibly upset, I pulled Laura aside to talk to her and when I did she said Jude couldn\u2019t be sexist because he was gay and how his friends have said he\u2019s \u201cbasically one of the girls\u201d. \n\nAs soon as lunch was over, I told my family that I needed a break and we went to a different part of the park for the rest of the day. I specifically told the table it was because Jude was being disgusting and I asked him if he was this much of a bully at school. When we got back to the hotel, a few of my siblings, including Laura, started to argue with me about if what I did was ok, they said that I was in the wrong both for breaking off and for the comments I made to Jude. Laura continued to defend Jude, saying he was a good kid who was just voicing his own views, and some of our siblings agreed with her, but some were saying I was in the right and Jude went too far. Later that night, Heston came in our room and thanked me, saying he wishes he spoke up and then asked me for some advice on girls. Laura is also mad that I gave him advice on girls, but he\u2019s a sweet kid and I know any girl would be lucky to have him. Laura said it was \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to her authority.

Frankly I think it's awesome that Heston was able to recognize what you did for him and to come thank you and I'm so glad he was able to ask you for advice. It sounds like he needs real adult support while he's at a confusing age, so I encourage you to keep loving on him and mentoring him. It's healthy for kids to have adult mentors outside of their parents, especially during their teen years, and it's a downright necessity if their parents are as unsupportive as your sister. So don't take your sister's comments about you overstepping her authority to heart. Helping Heston develop in a healthy and loving manner is more important than avoiding offending someone whose priorities are so skewed. \n\nGood luck on the rest of your vacation...", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It IS a problem, but misogyny is a systemic problem, not a demographic one.", "Because some girls talk like that to each other to seem cool, especially at that age, the mean girl clique isn't exactly a new concept. Honestly, I wouldn't even say he's specifically being misogynistic, just overly judgemental.", "I\u2019m bi and have definitely experienced more hatred (in the form of biphobia, erasure, and misogyny) from the LGBT community than I have from the straight community. It\u2019s not so bad in just umbrella \u201cgay straight alliance\u201d clubs, but any group I\u2019ve ever tried to be a part of that is specifically for \u201cgay people\u201d or \u201clgbt only\u201d has been a cesspool of hatred. Hurt people hurt people, and in my experience that especially reigns true in groups of people who are gathering *because of* them being hurt.", "Of course kids can be awful, and you know where they learn it from, right? Family, friends, classmates, media. \n\nI have in no way excused Jude's behaviour in any comment in these threads, and think OP is boss awesome as I've noted in my top level comment.", "Didn\u2019t forget it. Left it out intentionally. \n\nWhy would I list disliking men as something bigoted and irrational when men are the primary perpetrators of hate crimes against my community? Of mass shootings targeting my community? Or supporting laws that target and harm and silence my community? Fuck no. \n\nI\u2019m not gonna list a distrust and dislike of a group of people based on actual real harm that group does (and yeah, yeah not all men, but most by far) with irrational fear and hatred of groups based on an intrinsic personal trait. \n\nThere\u2019s a huge difference between the hatred and distrust a lot of queer folks have for men considering what men have actually done and are doing to our community (Pulse shooter, club q, the vast majority of republican lawmakers and governors trying to convert or kill the kids in our community) when compared to the baseless bullshit other in groups in our community face like the bi and transphobia. \n\nGet out of here with the \u201cbut but men too!\u201d crud.", "Ah misandry doesn't exist, because women are not in power in the world. There is no system of belief in which men are socially constructed as inferior to women.", "GOSH I love that last sentence so much \ud83d\ude0d"]}
