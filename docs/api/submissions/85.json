There's this son (maybe 32 years old) and father (maybe 55 years old) traveling with us and they got separated from each other, so they're asking people around them if they can switch w anyone so they can be beside each other. Everyone said no. It also caused a slight delay as the flight attendants were asking what's happening with them. They were seated one row and 2 seats apart, so they can still see and talk to each other. \n\nThe whole trip they were talking loudly to one another and exchanging stuff. Waking some people up.\n\nWhen we landed and was about to deplane, the dad talked to me and said 'word of advice, try to be more compassionate next time'\n\nHe went on and on even after there were stops in our conversation, but to summarize the old man's points are: \n1. Have some compassion, since you'll still be moving in an aisle seat and you get to help a family be together. (Yeah he's right but the aisle is by the window side so if someone has to pee, I have to stand everytime. Vs where I was which was in the middle part- aisle seat, the middle guy can ask the other side to move)\n\n2. It's not his fault the airline moved him, so I should be kinder (it's definitely not my fault either, don't pass it to me)\n\n3. if you are with your family wouldn't you want to be w them? (I said yes but I won't die or inconvenience someone else if we're not side by side. It's 6 hours, we can all survive)\n\n\nMy points:\n1. If they wanted to sit beside each other so much, why didn't they pay for the reserved seating. What if I paid for this reserved seat, will you still make me move? Will I get my money back?\n\n2. He's being entitled and assuming your option/ preference is greater to mine.\n\n3. I asked why do you NEED to be beside each other? He said his meds are with his son and he wants to share food. He was a capable man, didn't look like he was sick or anything. I asked him why didn't you prepare that before you flew? I asked him is this his first time flying in general? Haven't you flown alone before? He said yes and I was like so you are capable of being independent. \n\nIs it really a question of compassion? Or is it entitlement? If he was scared shitless about flying and need his son, I'd gladly move but no ones going to die or be seriously harmed if it didn't happen.", "created_utc": 1667239220, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yijhdp/aita_for_not_giving_up_my_plane_seat/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Unless the father was disabled or ill, there is no reason he couldn't sit a row apart from his son for six hours.

I'd also ask him why his 32-year-old son needs to be glued onto him. Does he want his grown son to sit on his lap?

Period.", "NTA - if they wanted to sit together they should have paid for tickets. They asked, they got their answer. This isn\u2019t like a parent and a young child but two grown adults.  They can manage sitting apart.", "NTA. Like, I don't see why it's not already a thing to offer to pay people to switch seats if you're not wanting to do reserved seating. Regardless, their lack of foresight is not your responsibility to fix.", "NTA - people are entitled asshats.  If they really wanted to sit together, they should have planned on it.

I am sorry you experienced it", "***N.T.A!***  \n\n\nSo much so.  \n\n\nFlying is miserable enough.   These were both adults, so there's no reason why anyone on the plane should have had to have accommodated them out of \"compassion.\"    \n\n\nThat's the dumbest thing he could have pulled out.  \"Compassion?\"  Why?  Was one of them going to die upon landing and this was the last 6 hours they have together?  C'mon now.  Over-dramatic much?  \n\n\nThis was a pair that thinks everyone else is beneath them.  You did nothing wrong.", "NTA - they asked you to switch seats which you had paid for and you said no.  End of discussion.  If they're so concerned about compassion they should have kept quiet during the flight and not disturbed other peopel", "Nta not once have I heard one of these stories where someone actually offers to compensate the person they are inconveniencing.

He was an absolute AH for saying that to you.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI thought the son was a child that needed a parent to hold their hand.... and then read that it was an adult. It was only 6 hours - and surely they were old enough to get up and get their meds if it was urgent.

You do not have to move and no one here expects you to either. If people don't reserve a seat that's too bad.", "NTA but why even engage with the weirdo. Silence is what I would have given him.", "NTA, some people are entitled for no reason.", "NTA. His argument is basically \u201cYou are rude for not letting me be rude\u201d", "NTA\n\nThese are two grown men.  If they can't be organised enough to reserve seats together, they can survive a 6 hour flight not sitting together.  If the older man needs medication, he should carry it himself - he is not a child. They're both entitled arrogant AHs.  The world does not revolve around them and their inadequate planning.\n\nPoor planning on their part does not constitute an emergency on your part.", "So NTA. My husband and I flew on Friday. We paid to pick seats that were next to each other. That flight ended up being delayed and we had to get moves to an earlier flight so we could make our connection, and unfortunately there were no seats together on the new flight. We sat apart for 3 hours and miraculously we both survived!!! Were we bummed? Sure. Was it anyone else's problem? Nope!", "NTA. I cannot tell you how many times this has happened to me. I reserve my seats early because I know exactly where I want to sit for my comfort. I\u2019m not giving my aisle seat up for anyone\u2026not for the old lady who tried to steal my seat in first class from Barcelona to NY, not for the couple who booked last minute tickets from NY to Stockholm, and not for the dude who had longer legs than me (lol). The fact that they didn\u2019t plan ahead is not my problem.", "NTA\n\nIf I want to be next to someone I pay for the seat next to them. Otherwise you run the risk of not sitting next to them. And then you can get over it", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDid he have this chat with literally everyone on the plane? Like why did you get this long rambling thing?

They wanted to annoy the other passagiers by making it so complicated in the hope someone has enough and give up their seat. You also don't need to scream. They are entitled AH. They are adults, they can  survive without sitting next to each other. Or did they want to cuddle the whole flight?!", "NTA. They should have booked seats together. Also, it\u2019s 6 hours. They\u2019re grown ass adults. Can\u2019t they manage a fraction of a day a few yards from each other?", "NTA sheesh. One of the many reasons I hate flying. I am perfectly fine driving 2200 miles to visit family. (Texas to a northern state) The few times I've had to fly, I give up part of my trip budget to get first class. If they were so concerned about being alone, give up some other luxury to get seats that can't be exchanged, and then they will be together the whole way.", "My husband and I have been sat in separate seats on long flights, and never even thought to ask anyone to move just so we could sit together. Because we're adults.\n\nIn what world can 2 adults not bear sitting alone for 6 hours? Read a book. Listen to a podcast. Surf Reddit. Sleep.\n\nDo this father-son duo go to the restroom together and share a bed as well? Good God. NTA", "NTA. I generally pay for seats on long haul flights, because I have a strong preference. These were two grown men, absolutely capable of sitting alone for a few hours.", "Info:   \"maybe 32\"?  \"maybe 55\"?    \n\n\nCome again?    those are weirdly specific 'maybes'.", "NTA", "NTA but I\u2019d take satisfaction that this guy was absolutely stewing about this the entire flight lol.

They are grown ass adults, more than capable of sorting themselves out", "NTA I\u2019ll never understand grown ass adults being surprised when the world doesn\u2019t revolve around them.", "ESH.  Is it really that hard to give up your seat for something that would convenience someone else?  But also, I would never ask if I were in their position, sometimes life hands you lemons.", "Well, not quite. If they want to offer you money to switch, they can give that a try after you say no to doing it for free, and see if it changes your mind.
