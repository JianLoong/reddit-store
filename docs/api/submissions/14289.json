My birth dad (John) who's 48M and my other dad Dwayne who's 45M. I call my birth dad John, \"Dad\". And I call my other dad Dwayne, \"Pops\". \n\nMy birth dad John was married to my mom for a few years, then she left my dad and yeah. They ended up divorcing and now she's somewhere in California, idk where or what she's doing. Haven't talked to her in ages. \n\nSo dad, and pops i'm super close with. They are the best parents any child could ask for. I love both of them and they've always been with me. My dad introduced me to pops when i was a little boy and they had told me they were in a relationship (and i was all for it because i had saw my dad become lonely/sad when he was single) so seeing the fact that my dad loves someone and has a life partner made me super happy. \n\nPops & Dad got married, and we've been living an amazing life. I'm probably more to close to Pops then my own dad haha. Due to the fact that Pops is really cool and he's laid back. I love both of them equally and they love me as well, and i'm blessed to have them as parents.\n\nFor a few months i've been dating this girl bella who's my age. I thought she's pretty cute and i liked her. So we kicked it and recently she told me \"My parents want to meet your parents and want to come over for dinner\" I said sure. I'll tell my family. \n\nSo yesterday, Friday night. Bella comes in. Pops greets her and says \"Come on in sweetheart, dinner is ready\". She says \"You must be \\_\\_\\_\\_ dad so good to meet you\" and she shakes his hand and she sees Dad come out of the kitchen \"He's holding the mac n cheese tray\" with the mittens and is putting it on the table. Then bella says \"Who's he?\" i said, \"Oh that's my dad\". She said \"I though he's your dad\" she's referring to Pops. I say yeah. That's my pops? And that's my dad? She pulls me to the side and says \"I didn't know your parents are gay? Oh my god? why didn't you tell me?\"\n\nI genuinely didn't know why, that'd be an issue or so. Because your dating me, not my parents and all. So it shouldn't matter. But i guess it's a concern for her. Her parents come at the door after they parked the car and bella tells her parents \"let's leave\" and they left. I told my parents i'm sorry and they said \"son don't worry this is nothing new haha\" and then we all sat down and enjoyed dinner and went to sleep. \n\nSo AITA for not telling?", "created_utc": 1680971523, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12fqxu0/aita_for_not_telling_my_girlfriend_that_my/", "score": 534, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But perhaps naive. Unfortunately it's probably better to let a girlfriend know you have two dads so you can weed out the homophobes BEFORE you accidentally bring them home for dinner. :(", "NTA, although I\u2019m surprised this hasn\u2019t come up in conversation with her in the past few months. Discussion of family (parents, siblings) is fairly common in early dating.", "NTA. I'm not sure I totally feel like you need to screen people or tell them your parents are gay specifically. I do think it is weird to meet families before you know what that family is like which would entail knowing that your dads are gay. \n\nDid you never talk about your dads? Did she never ask anything about your family or childhood? I can't imagine someone meeting my family and them not knowing ABC about my parents, how many siblings I have, their names, etc. Before they meet my family, I would probably say, my mom is super warm and goofy, her name is Jill. My dad is kinda weird socially but the nicest guy even if he comes off awkward. His name is Paul. My sister Carol and her wife Mary will be there too. \n\nTo me it just seems weird she didn't know anything about two very important people in your life. And if she didn't know that much about you, it makes sense you wouldn't know much about her either-- particularly what a crappy person she is.", "Let's get this out of the way, Bella and parents are terrible people.  Be happy you dodged that bullet.\n\nThat said, isn't it normal to give your partner some kind of briefing before meeting your parents for the first time?  Names, superficial personal details, something?", "NTA.\n\nI mean... in a very practical sense, I think telling potential long term partners that you have two dads early on (or at least before everyone meets up) would save you some heartbreak down the road, but that doesn't make you an asshole.", "As many has said NTA but it's a good idea to bring it up earlier next time around to save yourself the trouble of spending months getting to know someone only to then find out they where not worth your time or energy", "INFO: You\u2019ve dated this girl for months. How has the subject of parents never come up? After my parents divorced, Dad met Pops & Pops raised me as his own. \n\nSeriously, what did you two talk about?", "NTA but I find it strange you never talked about them on front of her...\nDon't you usually say a few things abbout your parents before the meeting like xx likes this and you should avoid that, while yy loves this and dislike that ?", "nta, but she and her parents sure are for just leaving like that.\n\nbut then, how if you're at a point where parents are going to meet, that both of you have yet to meet each other's parents?  or at least have yet to talk about them enough to know something like that lol.", "NTA\n\nThe only part that I found confusing about your story is that you're referring to her as your girlfriend, and not as an ex. \n\n***Eff homophobia***.", "This story sounds strange so I understand the people who think it's fake.\n\nHowever I'm going to answer as though it were true:\n\nNTA\n\nYou did a few weird things here. It's not a good idea to have your partner meet your parents for the first time without you having even spoken to her about them, know their names, know a little about them. It's not a good idea for both sets of parents to meet at the same time for the first time. You bring her, on her own, to meet yours. You go to meet hers. Only after both of you are comfortable with the other parents do you plan a meeting with both sets.\n\nStill, it seems she was as much at fault as you for arranging this while you two barely knew each other, so you weren't an AH, and her reaction made her one.", "NTA. You just dodged a bullet, take this as a life lesson. Sometimes the trash takes itself out.\n\nYou and your family sound lovely, I'm sure you'll meet someone that will adore your pops and dad as much as you do someday.", "Ohhh youch. NTA, and while I know it\u2019s gonna hurt for a while the reality is the trash just took itself out. I\u2019m so sorry. Hug your dads for me", "NTA but I'd suggest having this conversation in the future early in dating someone so you don't have to waste your time on homophobes (or expose your parents to them).", "NTA. But\u2026\n\nWhile this is definitely not a situation that warrants an \u201cOh my god, why didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d reaction with her showing her ass and leaving (disgusting, I hope you\u2019ve ended things with her). I\u2019m a little confused how you guys were at the point in y\u2019all\u2019s relationship where parents meeting parents is happening yet you haven\u2019t had enough conversation about your lives, etc. that would allow your gf to at least connect the dots re: your parents. Is it *vital* information that you *owe* a significant other? Absolutely not. Families obviously come in endless compositions. You should never have to slap a disclaimer on *anyone\u2019s* sexuality, jeez. But parents meeting parents is usually a sign that you\u2019re at least *entering* a pretty serious stage in your relationship, and for that to have never come up in any way is kinda wild. Then again, your gf sounds kind of obtuse anyways\u2026 maybe you\u2019ve mentioned things like \u201cI\u2019m going with Dad and Pops to the store\u201d before and she just thought you were talking about your dad and grandpa or something\u2026 IDK. Definitely NTA though.", "NTA, nothing wrong with letting the trash take itself out.", "NTA. Dodged a bullet.", "NTA but now you know to prevent anyone from wasting your time with their hate and ignorance, bring it up a lil sooner rather than later. She sounds awful and I\u2019m glad you dodged that bullet", "NTA, the fact that it's a really big deal to them is kinda awkward, but if it's a very nonchalant part about your life, then why would you need to announce it or prepare them for it?  \n\n\nIf your dad had remarried a black woman would you need to say \"by the way, my step-mom isn't white, be prepared!\"? just incase they were racists?", "NTA.  at only a few months of dating that is still a freshly started relationship and is the 'try out' phase to see if you and a partner will be good together.  and some details don't need to be said until later on.  especially a detail such as the orientation of your parents.  like you said, the person is dating you, not your folks.  \n\n\nand tbh, anyone that has an issue with someone's parents for any reason (unless said parents are doing illegal or abusive things) is not the one for you anyway.    it sounds like her and her family are homophobic.  not cool.  \n\n\nps - your dad and pops sound awesome, by what you say!   any future partner of yours will be heckin' lucky to integrate into your family.", "NTA. \n\nI do find it incredibly strange that you were dating this girl for a few months and never mentioned them though! Especially if you have a great relationship with them.", "Don\u2019t ever think you\u2019re TA based on someone else\u2019s homophobia. Better for you to know how ignorant she is now than years in the future. Not worth the energy", "NTA.\n\nYour family sound lovely, they missed a beautiful dinner and you all dodged a bullet. \n\nI don\u2019t really see the reason why you should have tell them before. I went to other people house without knowing if they had one or more parents and their gender, who cares?", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry. I really don\u2019t understand why it would be an issue for her. She obviously also didn\u2019t ask anything about your parents because then it would have been obvious.", "NTA, although naive on your part to not realize that even a non-homophobic girl might have also pushed her homophobic parents away to avoid an awkward and potentially contentious dinner.", "NTA she is", "NTA. \n\nBeing in a relationship means being exposed to your partner's family. And every family structure is different. Ultimately it shouldn't matter what that is as long as they're loving and supportive. \n\nYou likely dodged a bullet by them leaving. I would assume you wouldn't want to be in a relationship with someone who takes issue with what you've described as wonderful parents.\n\nNow this is just my opinion, and it doesn't matter the family structure, it might be best to introduce your partners to parents before the parents actually meet each other, and vice versa. This will kind of give you both the chance to compare parental personalities and prepare for potential issues between them. \n\nGood luck going forward!", "You were not required to tell her, but next time screen for homophobia prior to the introduction, for your dads\u2019 sakes.", "NTA\n\nDodged a bullet, even if this girl reaches out to you again just ignore her. Or send a message back saying you\u2019re not interested in a homophobe, or child of homophobes.\n\nSee it for the blessing it is, at least you weren\u2019t further into this relationship", "Awwww... NTA...it shouldn't matter. I want to hug you and your dads! What a dissapointment and so sorry this happened. Your dads sound awesome, so happy you have eachother!", "NTA, but she sure should have told beforehand that her parents were homophobic. That\u2019s a way more important detail to share before introductions.", "NTA never!!! Oml I have two moms and I would have been PISSED. Holy crap dude. Pretty much everyone knew I had two moms because I had this happen with friends as a child. It fucking sucks total ass. These people are not for you, they can let the door hit them on their way out. I\u2019m so sorry, I would be 100% done with this relationship. \nAlso we\u2019re like the same age and having gay parents for me at least was an ordeal growing up (I was pretty loud and proud about it, dunno why). So let me just say I feel you, she is trash, and you are NOT the asshole here, OP.\n\nETA: I am seething for you", "NTA, but in the future make it one of the first things you talk to a potential gf about during the fact-finding stage. Best way to avoid any hurt feelings, homophobes, etc. Let this girl go if you haven't already. She's not worth it.", "NTA.   However it does seem odd that the first time your girlfriend met your dads was the same time that both sets of parents got together.  Both my husband and I had met each others parents many times (family dinners, backyard BBQs, hanging out to watch TV etc).  The parents didn't meet until we got engaged", "Actually another comment made a fair point. At ANY POINT, you\u2019ve never ended up discussing your parents with your gf? That\u2019s weird and makes the post sound fake.\n\nYou would be NTA though, if this shit is real.", "NTA. Unless she specifically told you that her parents were a straight couple, you had no obligation to clarify that yours were a gay male couple. It might be a bit strange that it never came up, but you were and are not required to go around telling people \"I have two dads! They're gay! You know, two men! They're together! They're my dadsssssss, as in plural, because there's two of them and no mom!\" Heh. \n\nAlso, your ex girlfriend (I sure as hell hope she's an ex) is a homophobe. You are never forced to disclose information about you and your family so that others can see whether you fit in their hating mindset or not.", "NTA it\u2019s not your fault your gf is apparently homophobic. That\u2019s not something you should have to disclose before meeting. It\u2019s not like she would have ever sat you down and said \u201cby the way, my parents are straight.\u201d", "NTA and that saved you a lot of time!", "NTA. Honestly, this shouldn\u2019t be something that you need to tell someone. If one of your parents was a different race, immigrated from another country, had a disability, so many other things then your girlfriend might not have said you should have told her in advance. (She might have. It\u2019s hard to say the full extent of how awful her parents are.) Sadly, the reality is it might be better to disclose earlier on in the future so you know who not to waste time on.", "NTA. Wow not okay of your girlfriend. So homophobic and completely ridiculous. Break up with her ass! You can\u2019t come back from this.", "I do think you should have given her a heads-up, but in light of her reaction, I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t. NTA. \n\nCompletely understand her being surprised. I would be too. But behaving the way she did is unacceptable.", "In the months you\u2019ve been dating it\u2019s never come up that she\u2019s a homophobe? Seems hard to believe", "NTA but in general it\u2019s wise to prepare people for surprising situations in advance. i\u2019d be happy to meet a boyfriend\u2019s two dads but would prefer to know in advance so i don\u2019t stumble over my words. if anyone has a problem with it, then bullet dodged early.", "NTA", "NTA. Good thing you found our your girlfriend is a bigot early. Hopefully she\u2019s not your girlfriend anymore.", "NTA - You didn\u2019t do anything wrong by not specifying. It\u2019s something that could be surprising but isn\u2019t exactly mind-blowing or earth-shattering. However, I\u2019m not sure if your gf is an AH or not; maybe she was just afraid because her own parents are homophobic and she didn\u2019t want them causing a scene in your home. That would be the case where I think it could be wise to give a heads-up, just to avoid putting your dad and pops in an uncomfortable/unsafe situation.\n\nTalk with your girlfriend about why she did what she did and go from there.", "INFO you never told her your parents names? Ok", "How on earth do people start a introduction to the family situation without giving someone basic information? Like, do you have a super chill laid back family and you all love each other? Or do you have conservative folks that would appreciate modest attire, are politics a no go? How do you get to the point of wanting to introduce someone to your parents without having told them anything about them? I know about my friends parents who I will never meet, because people tend to bring up the people who they grew up with. Also as a queer person I don't understand how someone raised by queer people doesn't know whether or not the people he hangs around with are homophobic?", "I find it impossible to believe that a meeting of the parents would happen without any kind of conversation along the lines of \"what are your parents like? and \"what are their names/what should I call them?\" \n\nAlso, both sets of parents meeting each other after a few months of dating??? That does not happen. Maaaaybe the couple meets each other's parents this early, but parents are not meeting parents. Ffs, I know MANY couples whose respective parents didn't meet until the wedding!", "This reads as very fake. If it\u2019s somehow real, you gotta work on making it sound less like a bedtime story.", "Nta", "NTA dodged a bullet there. Bye Bella", "NTA but I think I'd tell potential GF to avoid the homophobes.", "NTA\n\nThe only reason I can think why this would be a problem for her is because either her or her parents are homophobic and if that's the case, you should dump her. Sorry you and your family had to experience that.", "Na fam, you seem like a good dude. Your GF is definitely an AH though.", "ESH \n\nObviously you dodged a homophobic bullet here, but you should consider \"prescreening\" this information so your parents don't have to deal with unnecessary bigotry. Just tell women ahead of time and if they object then you don't bring them home. It's the considerate thing to do for your parents.", "NTA, except perhaps to yourself.  You've now wasted a significant amount of time cultivating a relationship that isn't going to work out unless you accept her and her family treating your parents badly.\n\nI would suggest you talk to your dad and pops, and ask for their preference on how you should manage the situation.  The one advantage of this mess is that by taking your girlfriend by surprised, you got to see her reaction before she could think it through and maybe avoid the issue until things were much farther along. E.g., avoiding meeting your parents or introducing your family to hers, until it gets to the point where there is no other option.\n\nBut this is a matter of outing your parents to strangers, and needs to be handled according to what they are comfortable with.", "I mean they are the clear homophobic assholes but I do think its weird you didnt tell your gf about your family. Yea shes dating you. But i know more about your family background as a stranger on the internet than your gf did. And thats weird", "NTA, but a heads-up would have avoided an awkward situation. In fact it sounds like you have dodged a bullet.", "NTA- but it is good to be aware of this when navigating moving forward. There is nothing morally wrong with you not telling, but this is absolutely the type of reaction you should keep in mind moving forward. \n\nAnd talk to your parents about it too. See if theyd prefer you told people this before having them meet them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Would you mind telling me a little about yourself?\" \n\nESH", "NAH (except maybe the parents, or maybe you for making this scenario up\\*). \n\nHow is it you are at the stage in the relationship of parents meeting each other and you two haven't met the respective parents separately--or even talked about them? This is akin to that post (just yesterday) where the uncle just turning up in a dress at a big family event before telling his wife and kids about his identity. Surprise! \n\nYour gf might be fine with you having two dads. Did you ask her? Maybe she felt you didn't trust her with that info. Maybe her parents are not tolerant. If so, she would have needed to set some boundaries with them beforehand--or would have recognized a group dinner with them was a recipe for drama and suggested something else.\n\n\\*The reason I suggest this is made up is because OP ostensibly grew up with two dads. He would have encountered/been told about bigotry long before now, as his fathers said, it's nothing new. Also, not having ever met the parents before having a big group meal is also convenient to the plot, but not very realistic.", "So the plan was that both of you would meet each others parents, and the parents would also meet each other all in one night? Also neither of you had spoken about your parents at all prior to the meeting? \n\nNTA if this actually happened... but you have to learn to communicate in relationships. Not just because of homophobes, but just generally your partner should at least know your parents names before coming to dinner.", "NTA. Why is having two dads a shocking revelation that needs to be discussed well in advance?", "That one cyanide and happiness video LMAO", "This scenario sounds familiar. I loved the movie, The Birdcage!\n\nFor real, I\u2019d love to hear an update after you tell her and your parents meet hers.", "You're better off without someone like that in your life.  \n\n\nNTA", "oof sugar. \n\ni love the fact that you are so young, you have no idea that gay folks have been met with massive amounts of discrimination and bigotry.  i love that it would never even occur to you that your family wouldn't be accepted.  that having two dads is no big deal and it didnt even occur to you to need to explain it. It is just your reality. you are the future we should have in America. you are exactly what should be.\n\nyou are not the asshole. \n\nand alot of people here are going to say you should disclose it, and that it is wiser if you introduce your partner first and then the parents.  and yeah, that is probably easier it will definitely weed out people before exposing your dads, but unless it hurts them, don't feel obligated to do that.  your normal, is normal.  \n\nwhat a blessing you have, two dads that love you. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\nBut I don't agree with a lot of comments here. \n\nShe should have known before. Not because she may be homophobic or she should because of your parents sexual orientation. She should have known as its your parents. She should ask or you should tell her as its your parents. They raised you and are potential in laws. \n\nAsking about your family should be an early conversation when dating. After it goes from 'going out is fun' to 'we are exclusive and are discussing a future.' She shouldn't ask your parents orientation but should ask their names, what they do, etc. Basic getting to know you stuff. \n\nIts a red flag when she brought it up day of. Its a big red flag she left. Its a huge red flag she didn't care to ask about your family. To me that means she doesn't really care about you.", "I'm gonna say no. It seems a weird thing to announce. Plus, if you hadn't sprung it on her, you might not have gotten her honest reaction, and life is too precious to waste dating a homophobe.", "ESH. You can\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve never in your life seen any news about homophobes, some religious stance on it etc. And you never thought to protect your dads from that either by simply telling her in advance. \n\nIt\u2019s quite clear why the parents suck. Not sure on the gf, since I can\u2019t tell from the post if she just tried to get her parents out of there quickly before they notice, or if she\u2019s homophobic as well.", "Their reaction was weird and you shouldn\u2019t need to warn people in case they are homophobic. Sorry that you and your family had this experience.\n\nHaving said that, it\u2019s really weird that your relationship got to the stage of having parents over for dinner without you mentioning this fact to your GF of a few months. Like, talking about your family is a common discussion on a first date. How did this not come up over months? Not saying you did anything wrong, just that it\u2019s strange.", "I say it's both a case of NTA in not telling her, but that you should have told her.  \n\n\nI'm a little at a loss as to how you two had casual conversations that tend to once in a while come up as you date someone and have the fact that your parents are made up of two men didn't get mentioned somehow, somewhen.  \n\n\nJust from the rare generic speaking with co-workers or friends, let alone dating for a couple of months as potential partners, my and the other folks' parents come up in the lines of \"my mom\", \"my dad\", \"my moms\", \"my dad, mom and their boyfriend\", etc as family unit members.  \n\n\nHave you considered you, despite loving your parents very much, weren't keeping it from her unintentionally?   Possibly because somewhere there was a hint of this is how it may go down with her?  \n\n\nAgain, this is because I can't see getting to the poitn of \"have our parents meet\" without having had conversations that discussed our parents before that day more than once in passing and in enough detail to know the minimum of their names/sexes.  \n\n\nAnd, you have to admit you \\*know\\* that despite it being foolish that people have issues with non-hetero couples, especially marriages... from grumbling to violent/murderous degrees.   You cannot be trying to honestly pass off you didn't see any reason she should be told.   You have a grasp of the real world, it's obvious.     \n\n\nSo let's face you probably didn't have it not come up... you probably avoided it being realized.  \n\n\nLike said:  NTA for not telling her as there's no reason to act or feed into a stigma, but you should've told her because there is one.   This relationship would've been found to not be fitting due to her and her parents' views, it would've never have come to a meet-the-parents-night that wasn't going to work, etc. and you both could've been living separate lives with people more suited or on your own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe more I think about it, the more I \\*do\\* lean towards maybe you are an AH for it.    Because, again, this had to be intentionally withheld.  \n\n\nAnd then set up for a meet night knowing you'd withheld it.\n\n  \nShould your parents being the same sex be an issue for her and her family?  No.  \n\n\nShould you not hide things and cut off a relationship that's not going to work because of a partner's prejudices instead of avoiding addressing them just to wait until it can be a potential-scene, hopefully not (hopefully so?  Again and again, the odd holes in this story comparing the real way people getting to know each other act and what happened don't add up)?  Yes, it's wrong.  \n\n\nHer prejudice makes her an AH.... but what seems more and more like dishonesty on your part rather than some unrealistic obliviousness to the reality of people like her and what she was like as you got to know her up to the point of a parents-parents meeting point is fishy and is leaning into strong, strong suspicion you're an AH too who was either stringing things along for some reason of dishonesty or  hoping this meetup would be dramatic.   There's a tone of smugness over the ending of your post, too, in how well you all dealt with this \\*complete and total surprise at the possibility of happening with anyone, let alone this person you're serious enough to parent-meet with\\* that puts icing on the cake of the direction you were actually taking with this.  \n\n\nUltimately, NTA as it's not your fault others are prejudice in that portion of this.  \n\n\nBut there's big enough holes in this story here that there seems to be some definite AHing going on about what you were doing/why you weren't telling her/how you set up her finding out.  \n\n\nThis was not a normal course of events.", "NTA. Sounds like the rubbish took itself out.", "NTA.  I'd be more pissed that she didn't tell me her parents are straight", "NTA", "It shouldn't matter. \n\nI hope you dumped her. \n\nNTA", "I would say she is a much bigger asshole. But you must have known she'd expect a man and a woman to be your parents. I think it was very strange not to mention it at all. She may have felt she had been made a fool. But her leaving was probably because she's homophobic, which is obviously a much bigger issue lol", "Nta", "NTA.\n\nYou have two wonderful parents.  That's all she needed to know.", "I think you should tell anyone you\u2019re dating the sitch bcuz some people have traditional or conservative values so when you\u2019re dating someone if this is a dealbreaker for them then everybody knows the deal. Its not just about you two, when you marry into a family you both basically marry the in-laws too. They come along for the ride too.", "FANFIC.", "you think her parents are maybe issue?", "NTA.  This is not anything special to you, it is your family.  I find it odd that she never noticed you used \"Dad\" and \"Pop\" when talking about them.", "NTA. I never told anyone I dated my parents are straight, it shouldn\u2019t matter. You dodged a huge red flag my friend", "not neccessarily the asshole but having gay parents are defnitely uncommon though its lowkey kind of your fault cuz why didnt you ask her if she supports lgbt? you dated a homophobic without knowing lmao", "did she ever tell you her parents are straight?", "NTA. But never, ever let her into your life", "Definitely NTA - I usually drop that my mom is a lesbian into the convo on the first or second date to gauge reaction - don\u2019t want to waste my time", "NTA. You dodged a bullet. You have a lovely family.", "Don\u2019t for a nanosecond think you did anything wrong. While it\u2019s true that heteronormative people tend to assume parents are a cis male, cis female pair, that assumption of familial dynamics is their own ignorance, not yours\u2026 and don\u2019t let those type of people gaslight you. \n\nIt\u2019s good that you discovered Bella\u2019s and her family\u2019s bigotry now, rather than further down the line. As I\u2019m sure you realize, if she (or anyone else) doesn\u2019t accept your dads, then they are also not accepting a large part of you.\n\nBetter to move on and find someone who accepts you for who you are, and all that entails\u2014 including your gay dads.\n\n#NTA", "NTA for sure. Why would you even need to tell her-  Like she never asked so\u2026", "NTA", "NTA and I'll share an anecdotal story as to why. I dated a guy in college. He was from Boston. He referred to his dad and step parent as \"Mark and Bob (Bahb)\". I had no reason to ask further questions because it didn't matter - I was excited to meet them. I was a bit caught off guard when I first met them and realized that it was Mark and BARB, as in BARBARA! The Boston R, or lack of, got me. But ultimately it didn't change a thing. No one owed me any explanation for their relationship or gender or who they love or anything else. You dodged a bullet.", "Nah, you're NTA here. Bella should have been more accepting and understanding of your family situation. It's not your responsibility to disclose your parents' sexual orientation to everyone you meet, especially if it's not relevant to your relationship with them. It's her loss for being close-minded and intolerant. You and your family are awesome, keep doing you.", "NTA at all, but remember, some people, even people you think you like and want to date, are monsters. You did this all correctly.", "Nta for not announcing it...but to me it feels weird that it never come up in conversation, specially if you're meeting each other parents.\n\nI feel that at some point you would have told her a story about a childhood memory or something. Did you somehow avoid this?\n\nLike you never told her your mom isn't a part of your life? \n\nTo me it wouldn't be so much about you not saying they are gay, but not talking enough about them that it didn't come up, i would think you were trying to hide it, which would make me judge you for it, I'd wonder why you'd feel the need to do so.\n\n\nI hope I made sense", "NTA - though I would probably tell people just so you can weed out the homophobes early on. More for your sake then your future partners.", "NTA. If you would have told her before hand you wouldn\u2019t have put your parents in this position. She could have told you in advance that she and/or her parents are bigots.", "ur not the ass. she shouldn\u2019t have reacted that way at all\u2026 seems homophobic. def red flag!", "NTA but if you had told her you would have known right away what kind of person she was and wouldn\u2019t have wasted your time and energy on her! I just don\u2019t get it myself. I am I my 40s and was raised to believe that an adults life is their business!! I have have gotten to know some amazing people throughout my life because my mind and heart are open! Too bad this girl didn\u2019t have the same point of view because your parents sound great!", "You\u2019re NTA however, a heads up probably would have been best so she wouldn\u2019t have been confused initially. It didn\u2019t sound like she felt like it was an issue but to avoid slight awkwardness during her realization, I think it would have been nice of you to just quickly tell her.", "NTA at all!!! I can\u2019t believe she said that honestly, I think you dodged a bullet. I\u2019m still sorry that things didn\u2019t work out bc it sounds like you really liked her\u2026. But man that was just cruel.", "NTA\n\nI'll be honest and say you were being a little bit obtuse thinking this wouldn't be an issue at all, but the truth is it's really only an issue for the type of person **who isn't worth dating.** The type of person worth dating might be a bit taken aback at the unexpected irregularity of a same sex parented family, but really no more taken aback than someone finding out the person they're dating was adopted into a family of clearly different ethnicity. Really no different from finding out your girlfriend has chinese parents when she's black. It's interesting, but hardly worth freaking out over.\n\nI'd say it's a bullet dodged to know your girlfriend showed her ass this early on and since it's only a few months in you can safely say, \"yeah this isn't gonna work out. Bye.\" Better she be a standard unwilling homophobe than some two faced asshole who two years in starts dropping hints about bringing your bio mom in, and then when you get engaged goes on about the joys of motherhood, and then drops the bomb that she has been interacting with your biomom over facebook, and that she wants her at the wedding and your pops gone. It's a bridezilla tale as old as time.", "NTA \n\nThere might be a first time 'shock' because society doesn't expect it so we don't either, but there's a MASSIVE difference between 'omg you didn't tell me? (Why didn't you tell me earlier I don't mention a female mum?),' with an optional side of 'just need a minute to process this but then we're all good, you've got two dads and that ok!' compared to 'omg why didn't you tell me, two dads is wrong etc'\n\nMaybe I'm too generous, but sometimes it's just the initial hit rather than genuine homophobia. My parents for example were like in denial/shock for about two seconds when I came out as bi, but once they got over the 'hey ok this is new information ' thing, total acceptance. \n\nBut honestly your parents sexual orientation isn't a thing when they're dating you, so don't feel bad about it..", "Nta at all! It's baffling to think in this day and age people aren't accepting", "Did Bella tell you her parents were straight?", "Why didn't she tell you in advance about her homophobic family? NTA", "NTA however I don\u2019t think you should keep seeing this girl. She reacted really badly in this situation and showed you she won\u2019t ever be okay with it.", "I do think YTA for not letting her know before introducing them. It sounds like she's not homophobic but her parents are, and she would have liked a heads up to make sure her parents didn't act in a hurtful or offensive way towards yours. \nOf course her parents would be the biggest AHs if that's the situation!", "This is going to get downvoted like crazy. I'd say it was a bit naive of you to not mention it. Clearly it caught her off guard the same way it might have if one of your parents was in a wheelchair or blind or * insert really anything * and she wasn't expecting it.. She was definitely in the wrong for just leaving. But I could understand her being surprised and then staying anyway. She didn't though. \n\nOn a separate note, how is it that at 25 years old, your girlfriend is meeting your parents for the first time at the same time that her parents are meeting them (and presumably you)? That seems like a poor idea to begin with.", "NTA, sounds like you dodged a bullet.", "\"You didn't tell me you were homophobic!?\"\n\nWould have been my response", "I'm going to go with NTA, but I find it odd that after a few months of dating this person, it hasn't come up. Not the fact that they are gay or you have two dads, but it *would* come up if you mentioned your parents at all, which most people have in passing by a few months in.", "First. I don't know why you don't call pops \"the rock\" . Second where you put your parts is of no concern of mine. Literally has no effect on my life whatsoever. Not like I have to suck the pee pee. Third. Where's my dinner invite. Your family sounds awesome.", "Congratulations you escaped a homophobe.\n\nNTA", "INFO:  how did you get this far without talking about your parents regardless of anyone's gender??", "THIS IS THE ANSWER", "When I was in high school I had a boyfriend whose mom was gay and he lived with her and her partner. I was never told his mom was gay. I found out when I 1st met them. I had a sweeping thought of, \u201coh, his mom is gay. That\u2019s cool.\u201d I ended up becoming very close to his mom\u2019s partner. She was like a 2nd mom. Later in our relationship he told me, \u201cit meant a lot that when you met my mom you were cool about her being gay.\u201d There wasn\u2019t a reason not to be cool with it. This was over 20 years ago. My conservative, republican parents were ok with it. There was no reason the girlfriend and her parents reacted this way.", "I agree NTA, but a comment before she met them would have been good. Even a \"So we'll be meeting my Dad, his name is John, and my Pops, his name is Dwayne.\" I can't believe you got to a stage of her meeting your parents without you ever talking about them. The reason to say something is not because it matters to your relationship, but because it will help her develop a relationship with your dads if she makes a good first impression. Most people will be surprised because of heteronormativity, but also because it's just not average. I think it would've been better to say something, but by no means an AH move and she is definitely the AH for how she reacted.", "You beat me to it!! I came here to say he c should have replied \u2018what, your parents are straight?  You c should have told me\u2019. \n\nSounds like OP dodged a homophobic bullet.  NTA.", "OP didn\u2019t do anything wrong. But to be pedantic, I\u2019d be very surprised if the GF hadn\u2019t mentioned \u201cmom and dad\u201d or something over the course of months.", "THIS THIS THIS!!!! Heterosexual is NOT THE DEFAULT", "I love this lmao", "THIS is the best answer!\n\nAlso OP NTA! Your girlfriend showed you who she is, and now you need to decide if that's who you want to continue to date.", "And to add to that, did she ever tell him her parents are bigots?", "The answer of 90% of these situations become obvious if you just reverse the roles or swap genders.", "Ugh, this is such a good answer that I am ashamed for initially thinking that OP probably should've given his gf a heads up. I completely agree with you and I've picked up a new perspective on the situation! If I had an award, I'd be giving it to you right now. \ud83d\udc4d", "Yeah, I found it strange that thw GF was meeting OP's parents for the first time alongside of her own parents. I've always thought it made more sense for the person you're dating to meet your parents before theirs do, but, NTA either way.", "Maybe what we should do is expect/demand that hating assholes disclose their hate targets so we can know not to bother with them. And act shockingly outraged when they don't tell us beforehand.", "I agree with you. I noticed a lot of the push back in the comments make it sound like you're stating that op has some sort of social contract to disclose but I don't think that's what you mean.\n\nIt's like giving my SO a heads up that my period is like 2 days out. I don't OWE him this notice, but it makes the transition smoother when people communicate (like in general about life stuff)\n\nYou're awesome btw! Have a great day!", "Nah.

Your relationship is serious enough that you\u2019re introducing each other\u2019s parents (also seem to be skipping the normal stage of meeting them separately before deciding to combine families, but I digress) but somehow it\u2019s not serious enough to explain the very basics of your parentage?
