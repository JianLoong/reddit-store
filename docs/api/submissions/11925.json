That\u2019s pure weaponised incompetence. You CHOOSE not to put care and effort into gifts. No one is magically good at gifts, just like no one is magically good at cooking or cleaning or playing the violin. It\u2019s a skill that takes time and effort. You can learn to give good gifts if you care to do so.", "Totally YTA. 10 years anniversary is a significant one and \"not being the best gift giver\" is a really lame excuse. You've got a mouth to ask what she's been looking at and two ears to hear her response.", "Sorry man YTA for not knowing what your wife of 10 years is looking for. \n\nFlowers were awesome. Pair it with something personal. \n\nThere's no such thing as a good gift giver and a bad one. There's just thoughtless gifts and thoughtful gifts.", "YTA 10th anniversary is a big one. If you can afford it then it is time to do something to make up for it. \n\nIdeas such as jewelry or planning (and arranging appropriate childcare) fora trip just forthe two of you.", "YTA - saying you arent a good gift giver is a total cop out. You don\u2019t CARE to be a good gift giver. It isn\u2019t a PRIORITY for you to be a good gift giver. You CHOSE to not be a good gift giver. \n\nIf you care about someone you don\u2019t just pick up something from the grocery store on your way home from work.", "I\u2019m sorry, but I think YTA for this one. 10 years is a pretty big milestone in a relationship, at least one that calls for more than just flowers. They\u2019re a good starting point, but just a little something extra would\u2019ve made it amazing. It\u2019s not too late to treat her to a nice dinner or some other activity that she enjoys!", "YTA because there is no reason you couldn\u2019t have asked her if there was anything she had her eye on in advance. Or even for a category of gift she\u2019d be interested in (jewelry, perfume, etc). Flowers really makes it seem like you totally forgot to get her anything and just grabbed the first thing you could think of. Clearly she put a lot of thought into her gift for you, and it sounds like she wants you to do the same.", "YTA, ten years is a huge milestone and flowers, while nice are not a personal gift, especially for someone you\u2019ve been with this long. \n\nMy suggestion to fix this, is to put some thought into finding her a gift and take her out to a fancy dinner this weekend", "YTA. Flowers are pretty but they don't even last very long, so they're not a good gift on their own. You've known your wife for over a decade, surely you know her well enough to know what her hobbies and interests are to have some idea of what she might like as a gift?", "YTA. That is much too special of an occasion for simple flowers.", "YTA. Your wife got you something personal and you just picked up flowers from the grocery store on the way home.", "10 years?

You've gotta be fucking kidding me dude.  You put zero effort into this.  \"I'm not a good gift giver\" = \"I can't be bothered to try.\"", "My wife and I generally don't do gifts for anything. It's not for lack of money. It's because we both don't see the point in it. Precovid we used to do vip tickets to concerts once a year. If we see something that the other person would like , we pick it up.\n\n\n\nBut given that we pool our income , we both would know how much was spent.  OP says his wife bought a nice watch. I love watches. I have a $40 watch I got from woot.com that I like as much as my $300 Seiko.\n\nNot to financialy shame OP. What kind of nice are we talking?\n\nA $100 fossil watch from Kohl's?\n\n$300 Sieko from the mall?\n\nA 10,000 Rolex?\n\n\nBut the question is, how are gifts done normally? Is there a pre-negociated price limit?", "YTA-go to her and ask how to make it right. Maybe a special date somewhere you went when you were dating or something more pricey she would like.

Every couple is different but communication can prevent a situation like this", "It depends.  Are anniversaries normally a big thing for the two of you?

Traditionally, the women get a replacement ring if it can be afforded. If not an eternity ring. A lot of people renew vows and you just got her things she'll have to throw out and a vase she will have to clean. A vacuum would've been better. Sheesh.\n\nIf you're not a good gift giver, and you can get on reddit asking  if YTA, you can get on Google and search appropriate gifts for a 10 year anniversary.

This is the absolute laziest thing you could have done to show the person you're supposed to have loved for the past ten years that you're thankful and happy to be with them.

People are going to cheerfully ask her about your anniversary, and it's going to be really painful for her.  It's a big milestone, and you chose to cop out. \n\nLike all her loved ones, co-workers, ect are going to basically feel the same way that everyone in the comments are reacting.

I think flowers and maybe spending the day together doing something nice are a nice gift. I think a big gift should not be expected.\n\nMaking an assumption here, but it sounds like OP did not know that she would do a big effort gift, if she expected the same she should have communicated this in advance, not blown up about it afterwards.\n\nUnless, as you say in your last line OP, you always drops the ball and this was more like a final straw.. but I dont have enough info to judge that just from the post.", "YTA I think giving big gifts is kinda weird and don\u2019t expect them from my partner, but after 10 years you need to know how much this matters to your wife. I\u2019m guessing you might be like me and not really understand why someone would need to get a big gift, but I think the take away is that you should pay enough attention to know that this matters to her.", "YTA, but I think that you didn't mean to be. Saying that your not a good gift giver is weak. If only you would have shown effort she would not be so sad. She clearly did, she sounds amazing. My wife brought me to tears with my last birthday gift because it was very personal.", "YTA for not having paid enough attention to your wife over the past 10+ years to know that this would be important to her, and at least checking in about gifts.\n\nMind you, not communicating about gifts can have a funny outcome.  For our 11th wedding anniversary (traditionally a steel gift) my hubby and I each bought each other stainless steel Alessi brand fruit bowls. Different designs, but it was still a good sign that we are soul mates. And the one he bought for me was one I'd seen and loved, but avoided because I was choosing for him, not me.", "YTA", "YTA the only difference between a good and a bad gift giver is the effort put in. You went the easiest and most obvious route and are shocked it was bad? Flowers are for spontaneous acts of love.

You better do something\u2026anything", "By that logic, the wife should also read the five love languages and understand that gift giving is not the husband\u2019s love language when it comes to expressing it. \n\nNot saying that the wife doesn\u2019t have the right to feel disappointed. Because she certainly put more thought into the gift than he did. But to the extent that she\u2019s crying? That would be a bit strange, unless this isn\u2019t an isolated thing and OP doesn\u2019t pull his weight in other aspects of their relationship", "I was actually thinking weaponised incompetence as well.  I would even give my ex a spreadsheet at Christmas with ideas, yet he'd always tell me 'I'm not good at gift giving' cause he just didn't care.", "Exactly. Do you think these \"good gift givers\" are just born intuitively knowing how to give the perfect gift for any and everyone they meet, at any time and for every occasion? *Maybe* a few, but it'd be like...a one in a million talent. For most \"good gift givers\" it's a labor of love and a *lot* of effort at that.", "Or even ask her friends!!! There were so many ways OP could\u2019ve done", "Did he care about the gift tho? Did he want it? Or did she just use her standards and then is mad he used his standards?"]}
