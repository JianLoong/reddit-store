Take this opportunity to talk to her and understand what she wants, do better in the future. Check out the \u2018Five Love Languages\u2019, read it with your wife, figure your shit out.\n\nAlso, YTA for saying \u2018I\u2019m just not a good gift giver\u2019. That\u2019s pure weaponised incompetence. You CHOOSE not to put care and effort into gifts. No one is magically good at gifts, just like no one is magically good at cooking or cleaning or playing the violin. It\u2019s a skill that takes time and effort. You can learn to give good gifts if you care to do so.", "Totally YTA. 10 years anniversary is a significant one and \"not being the best gift giver\" is a really lame excuse. You've got a mouth to ask what she's been looking at and two ears to hear her response.", "Sorry man YTA for not knowing what your wife of 10 years is looking for. \n\nFlowers were awesome. Pair it with something personal. \n\nThere's no such thing as a good gift giver and a bad one. There's just thoughtless gifts and thoughtful gifts.", "YTA 10th anniversary is a big one. If you can afford it then it is time to do something to make up for it. \n\nIdeas such as jewelry or planning (and arranging appropriate childcare) fora trip just forthe two of you.", "YTA - saying you arent a good gift giver is a total cop out. You don\u2019t CARE to be a good gift giver. It isn\u2019t a PRIORITY for you to be a good gift giver. You CHOSE to not be a good gift giver. \n\nIf you care about someone you don\u2019t just pick up something from the grocery store on your way home from work.", "I\u2019m sorry, but I think YTA for this one. 10 years is a pretty big milestone in a relationship, at least one that calls for more than just flowers. They\u2019re a good starting point, but just a little something extra would\u2019ve made it amazing. It\u2019s not too late to treat her to a nice dinner or some other activity that she enjoys!", "YTA because there is no reason you couldn\u2019t have asked her if there was anything she had her eye on in advance. Or even for a category of gift she\u2019d be interested in (jewelry, perfume, etc). Flowers really makes it seem like you totally forgot to get her anything and just grabbed the first thing you could think of. Clearly she put a lot of thought into her gift for you, and it sounds like she wants you to do the same.", "YTA, ten years is a huge milestone and flowers, while nice are not a personal gift, especially for someone you\u2019ve been with this long. \n\nMy suggestion to fix this, is to put some thought into finding her a gift and take her out to a fancy dinner this weekend", "YTA. Flowers are pretty but they don't even last very long, so they're not a good gift on their own. You've known your wife for over a decade, surely you know her well enough to know what her hobbies and interests are to have some idea of what she might like as a gift?", "YTA. That is much too special of an occasion for simple flowers.", "YTA. Your wife got you something personal and you just picked up flowers from the grocery store on the way home.", "10 years? And that's it. Flowers.

You've gotta be fucking kidding me dude.  You put zero effort into this.  \"I'm not a good gift giver\" = \"I can't be bothered to try.\"", "My wife and I generally don't do gifts for anything. It's not for lack of money. It's because we both don't see the point in it. Precovid we used to do vip tickets to concerts once a year. If we see something that the other person would like , we pick it up.\n\n\n\nBut given that we pool our income , we both would know how much was spent.  OP says his wife bought a nice watch. I love watches. I have a $40 watch I got from woot.com that I like as much as my $300 Seiko.\n\nNot to financialy shame OP. What kind of nice are we talking?\n\nA $100 fossil watch from Kohl's?\n\n$300 Sieko from the mall?\n\nA 10,000 Rolex?\n\n\nBut the question is, how are gifts done normally? Is there a pre-negociated price limit?", "YTA-go to her and ask how to make it right. Maybe a special date somewhere you went when you were dating or something more pricey she would like. It's time to brainstorm though and fix it", "Need more info \nDid you and your wife communicate about gift expectation?  Every couple is different but communication can prevent a situation like this", "It depends.  Are anniversaries normally a big thing for the two of you?  Has she been saying she'd like to celebrate in a big way?  Or, is it possible that she's been hinting or telling you that this is important to her, and you haven't been paying attention?  10 years is a milestone, but if it's not something you normally really celebrate, that would be different.", "[removed]", "OP The traditional git for the 10 year anniversary is tin or aluminium\u2026.

Traditionally, the women get a replacement ring if it can be afforded. If not an eternity ring. A lot of people renew vows and you just got her things she'll have to throw out and a vase she will have to clean. A vacuum would've been better. Sheesh.\n\nIf you're not a good gift giver, and you can get on reddit asking  if YTA, you can get on Google and search appropriate gifts for a 10 year anniversary. There's literally no excuse.", "YTA. This is the absolute laziest thing you could have done to show the person you're supposed to have loved for the past ten years that you're thankful and happy to be with them. That bouquet is basically a slap in the face. That's something you give your housekeeper for a 10 year anniversary. Actually even for that relationship its still not good enough.", "I hope next year she just gives you a high five and says oh but I'm not the best gift giver and I thought you liked high fives?!?! YTA", "Yta. Wtf dude, seriously? Occasions to get your wife flowers: \n\n1) she's a bit down and could use some cheer\n2) you remembered how awesome she is\n3) she is having someone over for dinner and you know she'd love fresh flowers on the table.\n4) it's Tuesday.", "Agree with this. \n\nI love flowers, but if that\u2019s all I received for our ten year anniversary, I would be thoroughly disappointed. \n\nIt\u2019s not too late OP to make it up to her!", "Like a divorce lawyer?", "This is the real question. Everyone climbing up his ass don't know what the gift giving tradition is in their family. Our birthdays and anniversaries are usually just dinner out. 10th anniversary was a fancier place than usual. If they don't normally do big gift exchanges, then he was expected to be a mind reader.", "maybe?", "Are you trying to get OP divorced\u2026.!", "That's a really, really bad take mate.\n\nIt's the first benchmark anniversary, the wife gave a thoughtful and kind gift, OP gave a bouquet of flowers and a shrug.

A written card is what my fianc\u00e9 and I do for Valentines Day, this doesn\u2019t fly in other relationships where a planned date is expected.

You like what you like. Nothing wrong with that at all.", "No, it was literal. \n\nThe wife in this post was upset at the lack of thought / sentiment shown by OP. \n\nIt is highly unlikely that (however much you may like shares) she would see this kind of \u201cpresent\u201d as anything other than a further insult.", "I would be happy with shares in a company that mines metal. Preferably one that is about to start using some groundbreaking new method to revolutionize the industry. But I would appreciate the thought and effort that was put into it.", "Valentine's Day is just a forced day for romantic gestures though, it has absolutely no sentimental value to the vast majority of people. That's very different to it being your anniversary, let alone ten years. Obviously some couples don't even do anything for anniversaries anyway because that's just how they are, but OP must know his wife enough by now to know gifts are part of special days.", "[removed]", "You don\u2019t get it. Finding a creative form of the traditional anniversary gift is cool. It demonstrates thoughtfulness and sentiment. Don\u2019t agree with my opinion, that\u2019s fine, we\u2019re not married. Scroll on\u2026", "You would be surprised. I honestly believe most couples should communicate more about expectations in general. I still stand that they would benefit from therapy, as every couple is different and have different expectations of doing things. Assuming OP should just know what she wanted is ridiculous and presumptive. If OP and his wife took the time to communicate what their wants and expectations are I\u2019m sure this gift exchange discrepancy would not have occurred.", "in the recent years why hasn't there been as many?", "U think in 10 yrs op didn't have the time to communicate?", "It\u2019s not just on OP to communicate, it\u2019s a two way street."]}
