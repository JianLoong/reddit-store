She's slowly returning to normal, and my mother and I try to help her, like ordering protein/fat-rich options for her at restaurants, checking under the table or in her napkin to make sure she hasn't thrown anything away (because she used to do that), telling her she would be prettier if she gained some weight, etc.Anyway, for Chinese New Year vacation we went on a girl's trip to Cambodia, and while there we went to this buffet which was pretty popular, so we had to wait in line for most stuff. While we were, I noticed my sister eating appetizers she already got from her plate with her fingers and I told her to stop. She didn't listen, and continued to do so which embarrassed me so I left the line & I went to complain to mom. When she got to our table, I laid into her and asked her what the f she was thinking, what she was doing was embarrassing and disgusting and why couldn't she wait 15 minutes, it's not a timed buffet and she could just get more food later if she wanted and she could gain like 10 fucking kilos acceptably (I suspect she was eating with her hands because she thinks \"if it's not eaten at table it doesn't count\"). She was silent but gave me a look, my mother just chuckled a bit but I think she agreed with me. I told my friends about it in the group chat and one of them said I was too direct, but everyone in my family is (except sister who has always been sneaky and soft, not just about food), and she suggested I ask here. So, Reddit, AITA?\n\nEdit: A lot of comments about how I am shaming her for eating. I am NOT shaming her for eating, she can eat what she wants, my problem was with her eating *in line*, *with her hands*, which is kind of disgusting and embarrassing, even though I'd already told her twice not to, and even grabbed her hand once.  \nSome comments about publicly embarrassing her, no, it was loud and I couldn't even hear what the cooks were asking me sometimes so definitely no one could hear what I was saying to her (and we don't even speak the same language so they wouldn't have understood).\n\nAlso, no matter what any of you say, I love her, she's my sister.", "created_utc": 1675942616, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10xsmvj/aita_for_calling_my_sister_out_at_a_buffet/", "score": 191, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You yelled at her over eating food. And you wonder why she has an eating disorder? Check yourself", "This story makes me feel incredibly sad for your sister, but mostly confused.\n\nSo your encouraging her to gain weight and then shaming her for eating?\n\nIt sounds like she has a very complicated relationship with food, caused by being shamed in her early life. How exactly is more shame from you and your mother going to fix that? \n\nYTA, I think you\u2019re probably trying to help her. But surely a more compassionate approach would be more helpful for her.", "YTA. Good lord I hope this is just bait. Because wow wow wow. You and your mom are literally only helping to make her condition worse. Massive overreaction.", "YTA big time. You are harassing and policing the eating habits of your sister whom you know has suffered an eating disorder caused by family members harassing and policng her eating habits. \n\nAre we really supposed to believe you're doing that for her own good, not because it gives you the thrill of being her bully?", "YTA.\n\nWhy are you shaming an anorexic for eating? And going to your mother, who you hold partially responsible for shaming her into an eating disorder in the first place. Are you emotionally invested in being the \"good daughter\" or something?", "YTA and I'm sorry for your sister to have to deal with such monsters", "YTA \u2018telling her she would be prettier if she gained some weight\u2019\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t be commenting on her weight at all.", "YTA... not just because your sister already has a more than  problematic relationship with food and you are making it worse but also simply because it's not your place to be embarrassed for her.

She is literally ill. And yet you find it appropriate to comment on what she eats? You should be ashamed, YTA\n\nAnorexia is a very serious illness, which can easily be worsened if the people around you act badly. if you truly love your sister, you are gonna research how it feels to have this illness, what makes it worse, what makes it better, and you are gonna ask your sister how to help her best.\n\nYour behavior is very childish, and this is too serious a situation for you to tattle to your mom and family and trying to shame her.", "YTA.

I don't think you realise how serious your sister's eating disorder is. Anorexia is the mental illness with the highest mortality rate, and it's something people struggle with for years.

Because she needs it, and successful treatment usually also involves providing the family with guidance about how they can support the person.", "YTA. Wow you're actually so narcissistic and psychotic to a certain extent. In your post you're talking about calling her out about her using her hands to eat food then why would you bring weight and eating disorder into this? Table manners have NOTHING to do with weight.

Why would you be mad at her for that?\n\nAlso, I know you mean well, but telling someone with an eating disorder they'd be \"prettier\" if their body changed is perpetuating the idea that beauty is the most important thing in life and weight is intrinsically attached to it. It's extremely damaging.\n\nYTA", "YTA, you should have realized when your mother, who was part of the problem in the first place, agreed with you.

And instead of being happy for her and about her recovery, you decide to be petty about something that has literally nothing do with you and that doesn\u2019t affect you in the slightest and do the one thing that\u2019s pushed her into an eating disorder in the first place and shame her about eating.", "INFO - Why are you working so hard to make sure your sister has an eating disorder?", "YTA if this is real, but I suspect it's not because it took me 30 seconds to google \"do people eat with their hands in Cambodia?\" and find out that yes, it's culturally very common there.

You are causing more damage - not helping.", "INFO: Am I missing something cultural here, like is eating with your hands really really bad in your culture for some reason? Like were the other diners staring at her in open mouthed horror and fighting the urge to vomit? \n\nBecause honestly, this seems pretty normal to me and I feel like appointing yourself the food/manners police when you know she has a very complicated emotional relationship with food is way out of line. Treating your elder sister like she\u2019s a misbehaving child is also extremely not okay.", "YTA. What's the point in going to a buffet if you don't pick a lil up and eat it to make more room on your plate. She has an eating disorder, commenting on her eating won't help. Showing support and empathy will!", "YTA. Why would you shame a recovering anorexic for eating at any point?!

You are totally the asshole here.", "YTA\n\nFirst of you are being ridiculously sensitive about the original situation, eating with fingers is fine, and for a buffet I don't see why it's hugely wrong to snack on the food before getting to the table.\n\nAs an adult you then went crying to your mother about how your adult sister was eating, what are you? 8 years old?\n\nThen you bring in her weight, which first off is not acceptable even if she hadn't struggled with food, and it's even less acceptable considering her situation. \n\nSounds to me like you were acting like an oversensitive child, and then tried to attack your sister where you knew she'd be most vulnerable.\n\nThat your mother might have agreed with you matters dick considering she was one of the people who made your sister the way she is.\n\nThat your friends might agree with you matters even less, shitty people tend to attract shitty people.", "ESH.

Now that she's working her way through her ED, ya'll still shaming her with comments like 'you'd be so much prettier if you gained weight'.  Helpful hint here: THAT IS NOT HELPFUL. \n\nTHEN, your sister is eating- in a way and place YOU don't like so you FOOD SHAME HER further. \n\nThere's no win for this poor woman and with loving family like you all, she doesn't need enemies. \n\nNote:  Having your heart in the right place doesn't make what you're doing okay", "Could you just leave your sister alone.

I still have a very complicated relationship with food and my body.\n\nAnd you know what? My family said the exact same thing you are - we love you, we just want the best for you. But here's the kicker, that's not how it came across to me, and I sure as hell don't think it's coming across that way to your sister. You infantilize her decisions regarding food and treat her like a small kid that doesn't understand decorum. It's a buffet that has a wait. Did it cross your mind that your sister might have just been hungry? And the food was appetizers. Did she handfeed herself soup or was she munching on an eggroll? \n\nRegardless, she's 21 years old. Last I checked, that's an adult. She doesn't need you berating her in public over her food choices or how she wants to eat it. I can guarantee you that no one cared what she was doing - just you.

I get that you want your sister to be \u201cnormal\u201d although I think it\u2019s because you\u2019re embarrassed and not because you care about her getting better  like you claim, but you need to fucking get over it and accept that she\u2019s probably  gonna have weird food behaviors and rituals around food for the rest of her life given how sick she got.

Yeah, skinny shaming her isn't the best way to make her get a healthier relationship with food at all. I mean YTA for that alone.

You are the asshole because you DO NOT get to control the actions of others, even if they\u2019re doing something that causes you mild secondhand embarrassment. Fine, I get that you didn\u2019t mean to shame her for eating and you encourage her to eat in fact, but you need to take a step back and reevaluate your priorities.

I understand your specifying that you were upset about when she was eating not what. But for someone recovering from an ED you should just not comment on their food or eating habits at all.

Honestly you keep doubling down and digging your hole deeper and it\u2019s not making it better. She was eating finger food off her plate. So what if she was still in line, it\u2019s not like she was standing at the buffet and eating it directly from there. The context of her ED just makes the whole thing worse since you should be glad about ANYTHING solid that she eats, no matter how and where, but even without that\u2026it\u2019s a buffet.

The two of you are adults and you yelled at her in public, GRABBED HER HAND, and complained to your mother. The only immature and embarrassing actions in this story are from you. \n\nYou weren't \"direct\", you were rude. You told her one time you thought what she was doing was inappropriate, she clearly disagreed. That's where the story should end. You don't get to control her actions, and you certainly shouldn't be putting your hands on anyone.\n\nWhy do you think you have the right to police your sister's actions, including physically? That's really a question you should sit with. If your sister decided something you did was inappropriate, would you be fine with her berating you and grabbing you until you did as she wanted? My guess is no, so get a grip on yourself and realize you don't get to control other people.", "YTA, you could have said don't use your hands at the buffet. Other people have to eat eat food.

She's slowly returning to normal, and my mother and I try to help her, like ordering protein/fat-rich options for her at restaurants, checking under the table or in her napkin to make sure she hasn't thrown anything away (because she used to do that), telling her she would be prettier if she gained some weight, etc.   \nAnyway, for Chinese New Year vacation we went on a girl's trip to Cambodia, and while there we went to this buffet which was pretty popular, so we had to wait in line for most stuff. While we were, I noticed my sister eating appetizers she already got from her plate with her fingers and I told her to stop. She didn't listen, and continued to do so which embarrassed me so I left the line & I went to complain to mom. When she got to our table, I laid into her and asked her what the f she was thinking, what she was doing was embarrassing and disgusting and why couldn't she wait 15 minutes, it's not a timed buffet and she could just get more food later if she wanted and she could gain like 10 fucking kilos acceptably (I suspect she was eating with her hands because she thinks \"if it's not eaten at table it doesn't count\"). She was silent but gave me a look, my mother just chuckled a bit but I think she agreed with me. I told my friends about it in the group chat and one of them said I was too direct, but everyone in my family is (except sister who has always been sneaky and soft, not just about food), and she suggested I ask here.

When you have an ED your brain makes up all sorts of arbitrary rules about when and how it is \"okay\" for you to eat. But if she is only comfortable eating in line and you tell her she can't do that, then you are essentially telling her not to eat. \n\nOr maybe she's just getting better and starting to listen and respond to her own hunger cues and realized she was actually really hungry already and wanted some nibbles while she had to wait.
