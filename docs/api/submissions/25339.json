I told my friend this, and offered to wear a pink trousers and top instead.\n\nHowever, my friend has repeatedly insisted that I wear a dress so we can all match. A few days ago she sent me a photo of a pink dress that she'd bought me. I felt so guilty but I once again, said I wouldn't wear it.\n\nAITA? My friend is upset.

You expressed you didn\u2019t feel comfortable in a dress and that\u2019s totally OK. You even made an expecting where you could still be in the color scheme and still feel comfortable. She bought you a dress to guilt trip you into wearing it. I\u2019m sorry but birthdays really aren\u2019t that seriously where everyone needs to be wearing the same thing and especially buying you something you already said you didn\u2019t want to wear. Seems a bit of a control freak. I\u2019d politely decline and tell her you\u2019d still like to come if you can wear the color, just not a dress. If she continues to throw a fit, definitely a no-go friend.", "NTA You offered a perfectly reasonable compromise. I was recently a bridesmaid in my brother's wedding. Myself and the MOH (bride's sister) wore suits to match the groomsmen. Everyone was happy, including my SIL who just wanted us to be comfortable and look good. Your friend should respect your boundaries. If not, maybe you should reevaluate your friendship.", "NTA - your friend is invasive. You cannot force your aesthetic on someone - you either want the person's company or you want a weird entourage.", "She sounds exhausting.  This doesn't sound like a friendship that is worth taking beyond a few months.  There's asking, and then there's demanding, and then doing what she's doing.  Give in now and she'll just know she can get away with it.\n\nNTA", "Nta.  \n\nThis woman is 20, not 6.  You wore pink. That's good enough.", "NTA. You have clearly stated your boundaries and offered a compromise. She is ignoring that and attempting to stomp all over them.  Stay firm!!!", "NTA. True friends don't try to force, strong-arm, or guilt their friends to wear something they'd feel truly uncomfortable in. They want their friends to be themselves in all of their awesomeness. I think pink trousers and a top sounds like a perfectly reasonable compromise.", "NTA\nAt 2 months in, she is not even your friend yet. You compromised, yet she insists. Let her go. Never let anyone push you to break your boundaries. Good people will show respect.", "NTA. You offered to wear pink clothes, a good compromise, and one that would allow her to still have her pink theme. If its THAT big a deal for her to have everyone in pink dresses and not just pink clothes, then just don't go.", "NTA - you stood your ground and offered a compromise. Good on you for holding your boundaries at a young age. A true friend wouldn\u2019t put their friends in situations where they are uncomfortable especially when there\u2019s an easy solution.", "NTA\n\nYou're an adult. No one gets to decide what you wear, even if they buy it for you. Only time you might have to concede on this point is if you're part of a wedding, but even then you shouldn't be in a wedding of someone who disrespects you on such a basic level.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWHat a bullshit. YOu are fine to use your own wardrobe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is no need to wear a dress, or to wear pink.", "NTA, I can't ever understand why anyone would try to control what anyone would wear, theme or no theme.", "Nta\n\n\nYou're not a prop for her vision.  When will people ever learn that you do not get a say on someone's wardrobe. \n\n\nIf it's going to be a wear or die situation, you have bigger problems. \n\n\nYour friend has some serious control issues.\n\nI wouldn't attend. Tell her to respect your choice next time.\n\n\nIt's your comfort level.", "You're not her dress up doll. You have agency over yourself. Set your boundaries and don't cave into her silly demands. Nta", "NTA. She clearly doesn't know you well, and if she can't get past this, I'm guessing she isn't gonna know you much better, either. Your compromise of pink top/trousers was a good solution.", "NTA.\n\nYou've just been friends over the summer if it's the past two months? I'm a bit confused about the timeline, but there are plenty of better friends you can make this fall. You shouldn't have to change yourself to fit someone else's expectations of you.", "Nta. Only some people like wearing dresses. You could wear jeans underneath it like they did in the 90s I think?", "NTA. You have a new VERY high maintenance friend and I really doubt  this new friendship will stand the test of time. I agree this is silly, demanding and invasive and you're probably not really 'friend compatible'.\n\nBTW when she gets engaged and wants a bachelorette party and multiple wedding showers.....Run. Run far far away.", "NAH  \n\n\nseems like she is being overly instant on everyon being in pink dresses for the party you can just chose not to attend if she is unwilling to allow you to both attend and be comfortable", "Light YTA.. because you would only be wearing the dress for her birthday party, which clearly means a lot to her. I'm sure ONE NIGHT of wearing a dress won't kill you. Maybe you just shouldn't attend the party.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s an invitation, not a summons so if you don\u2019t want to wear a pink dress and your \u2018friend\u2019 insists you have to, the solution is to not go.", "NTA at all. Friends don\u2019t force friends to wear something and be uncomfortable. She\u2019s a crappy friend", "Not even a bridesmaid situation? Come on, now. \nNever in my life have I heard of a Birthdayzilla before", "I'm torn between everyone and no one so I'm not going either way, as I see it there are two choices that you guys have, she can have you in pink pants and a shirt or you can just not go. She has to choose between having you as authentically you or not having you at all. Don't become someone you don't like because people who truly love you wouldn't ever ask that.", "NTA. She can't control people. Tell her to get over it. Wear what makes you comfortable.", "You\u2019re not her toy doll to dress up as it pleases her. You said no. *NO IS NO*. \n\nShe can be mad all she wants. She\u2019s not respecting your boundary or your compromise. She\u2019s not a good friend.", "A real friend doesn\u2019t treat their friends as accessories", "NTA. you offered a reasonable substitute. nothing like that one poster a while ago who refused to dress up for a dressy party and was confused people didn\u2019t want her in photos. \n\ndid you go to the party in your pink top and pants?", "Nta.  Fuck those mandatory themed parties.", "NTA.  This is actually very silly. And you'll all look ridiculous in your pink dresses.  She may not think so now, but trust me, when she looks back at the pictures, she'll realize how ridiculous they looked.  You explained to her that you're not comfortable in a dress & that s/b the end of it.  But she is being pushy & trying to pressure you into it, making you even more uncomfortable.  My friends would never make me feel uncomfortable.  You may want to reconsider your \"friend\" choices.", "NTA.  What is it with people thinking they can just order people to wear what they want?  You can always ask, and you can even set requirements for a party, but then you have to accept a \"no\" to the clothes or attendance and not be a tool about it.", "NTA \n\nI love thematic birthdays. I have done some myself. But the key is to make the person comfortable enough. The theme is \u201cpink\u201d, not \u201cpink dresses\u201d. You offered alternatives and solutions and she still wouldn\u2019t accommodate. \n\nNTA", "The second the word \"theme\" enters the conversation I'm mentally checked out, but that's me.\n\nThe crux of the matter for your situation is that this person clearly doesn't have any clue who you are.  \nShe's never seen you wear a dress, you told her you don't like dresses, you said that your style is \"way more butch\" (which I would expect she would have observed in two months).  \nShe should have been happy that you even agreed to wear pink, ffs.\n\nNTA", "NAH. Your friend is hosting a party with a dress code. You don't think that dress code aligns with your style. You don't have to go, and she doesn't get to be upset about it if you don't go. \n\nShe does get to be upset about it if you do go, since the dress code was made clear well in advance.", "NTA.  No one should have to wear clothes they're uncomfortable in.", "NTA just skip the party, doesn't seem like your kind of event. Which is totally 100% ok", "Exactly. You\u2019re not hurting your friend. You\u2019re just not agreeing to her suggestion, and offered a compromise. Thats what friends do.", "I would maybe and just barely do the whole matching dress thing if it was a friend of 40 years, we best friends and have faced death together at least 3 times. If she insisted, it would mean the world to her (I do not like dresses either) \n\nBut someone I've known for 2 months? Nope. That's too much to demand, and just buy a dress and expect people to follow along.", "Of course it wouldn't kill her, but OP's friend is saying I don't care about your boundaries if you're going to come to my party then you're going to dress how I want you to dress. She bought OP a dress after OP specifically told her no. How entitled can a person get?", "You know what? People aren't props. Op is uncomfortable.  That is all you need to know.\n\nWhy do you feel her friend gets a say in wardrobe choices?\n\n\nHow would you feel if a friend tried to force you into wearing something you didn't want to? All for the sake of her vision. \n\n\nBs. Birthday or not, it's never ok to force a boundary.", "Maybe it's because I'm a man, but I find the idea of asking your friends to wear matching outfits for your birthday party completely ridiculous no matter how long you've known them. I get that some people do that for bachelorette parties, but for a birthday? What is she 10?"]}
