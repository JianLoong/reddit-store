It is perfectly understandable for you to be very protective of your baby after what you have suffered. You might consider a photo rather than in person when you feel ready. It is understandable why they would feel the desire to meet your baby. Hopefully, they won't be seeing their son free for a very long time.", "This is what \"supervised visits\" were invented for. \n\nEx's parents might be a potential good resource for your baby, and it sounds like they would not approve of your ex's abuse and crimes against you. \n\nBut maybe they didn't do such a hot job raising your ex. Maybe they're a big part of the reason he's a d\\*ck. \n\nSo you can let them visit...in your presence...when your mom or some other trustworthy person just \"happens\" to be there too.

You do realize they can take you to court to see that child- do you have money for lawyers, do you really want to fight this? what will you do when your kid asks why their other family doesn't want to see them? They offered to come to you to see the child- what are you scared of? You can control the narrative and the visitation but if you don't at least TRY they can take you to court and get visitation where you won't be able to be present.", "YTA. If these people are so untrustworthy you should want nothing to do with them or their money. But accepting money and gifts and then deciding they can\u2019t see their grandchild is mercenary callousness.", "NTA. You get to make decisions to keep yourself and your child safe. No one has the \"right\" to see the child except the parents, and he waived his by getting himself imprisoned. Grandparents who successfully sue for visitation are the ones preserving an existing relationship. That does not apply here. If they wanted to prove themselves helpful, sincere, and trustworthy, threatening a lawsuit is not the best route.", "You're NTA. With all you have been through, you need time to recover and time to build trust with them. Sure, they sent money and baby stuff, but that doesn't mean you owe them a relationship with your baby. If they were wise, even if you're in a state where grandparents have rights to see their grandchildren, they would tread lightly and step back and give you that time.\n\nEdit for judgement, originally put \"would not be.\"", "NTA. \nYour child , your choice. \nMoney can't replace trauma... \nThey can get upset but have no right to enter your life suddenly or bother you at this time. \n\nYour brain is trusting your instincts right now and that's why you feel uncomfortable to even let them see the kid. \nTrust your gut. Keep your parents in the loop and stay safe.", "I am not even sure how to vote on this. BUT don't be a user. Don't accept financial support and baby supplies from them and then tell them they can't meet their grandchild. They have supported you through this and were disgusted at their son's actions.

Trust your instincts and if they want to go to court, that\u2019s on them. To be honest, grandparents are almost never backed in court, so I don\u2019t see that being a real issue for you. If they want to build trust with you before meeting their grand baby then they can put forth that effort.", "NTA. Reality is, your ex is their son and they will always prioritize him, even if it means screwing you over. One of my good friends was nearly killed by her husband, and after she was granted full custody, the grandparents still worked against her to try to get the kids to their son (who was incredibly dangerous). \n\nBest thing is to cut them off. Don\u2019t accept any more money or gifts, and ignore all messages and calls.", "Grandparents' rights are difficult to obtain in ALL 50 states without proof of parent being unfit. **I wish this sub would stop with the, \"check your jurisdiction.\"** \n\nThey are not in a position to give you ANY trouble, especially with your proof about your ex. \n\nYou JUST had a baby. Bond, enjoy, live.", "This is tough.  If you are holding the child away from them because you are afraid they will give your ex access to your kid or are themselves a danger, then N T A\n\nIf you are holding the child away to punish your ex then Y T A.  Your child is going to need as much love as possible, esp since their father won't be in their life.\n\nIt is hard to judge you because I have been no where even close to being in your shoes.  Just put the best interest of your child first.", "NTA. Let the courts settle it. There's reasons people are abusive. A lot of times it's because their parents were. They might not be, but let someone else get the full story and decide.", "NTA and you don't have to make any decisions right now. This isn't a situation you need to figure out at this time, you're healing from an abusive relationship all while dealing with the post-partum hormonal stuff. Let them know you don't feel comfortable and you can't be around them right now. If they don't understand, that's their problem.", "YTA. You accept their money and then refuse to even let them meet the child? Disgusting. They didn't beat you. They are ashamed of his actions and supported you. As a single mom with a kid on the way and a father who likely won't be paying child support you'd think you want a bit of family around to help out. Especially a family willing to put you over their own son.", "Esh\n\nWhy.\nBecause when your kid grows up knowing that the grandparents wanted to be there. Your child, now an adult will resent you big time.\n\nIt happened to me with my mother withholding visits from my dad's family.\n\nWhen I was 18. She couldn't stop me.\n\nFound out I had 2 half brothers and a half sister. Grandparents that were amazing.\n\nAlso found out my mother used me as a weapon against them.\n\nI'm not on good terms with my mother. Only now at 40yrs old am repairing our relationship.\n\nThis is not about you. This is about the kid and your child's future.\n\nIf they turn out to be assholes. Then stop the visits.\nBut you have shown nothing in anyway that they are assholes and would be a danger to your child.\n\nSo I see it as what my mother did.. using the kid as a weapon. Hope you're not doing that.", "Does going to prison waive all his rights as a parent? Genuine question.", "OP I would strongly recommend you find a legal clinic that can help you consider your options such as a protection order from the baby's father, because you said he is doing time but you don't know for how long or when he will be released so it's imperative you go ahead and put one in place.  While you're doing that ask about his parents and what rights they may or may not have and determine your plan of action there.  You said they were unaware of what was going on, and that may possibly be true.  However, be aware of your options and cover all of your basis.", "NTA. It is your baby. Not theirs. They have no rights here and if they think taking you to court will make you more likely to let them see the baby they are sorely mistaken. Sounds like their whole family is the worst.", "NTA let them try court. They'll be laughed out. \n\nYou have to do everything you can to feel safe and secure. Cut contact. The only kid they are entitled to see, is the one they made. Considering how he turned out, I don't see how they could be good around yours.", "NTA. Grandparents have no rights to that child.  You need to do what is best for you and your child, to heal from what your violent ex did to you and to protect yourself in the future.  Your child deserves a mother who knows how to set healthy and protective boundaries in the wake of a horrible trauma.", "NTA. It's 100% your choice whether to allow, or not allow, them to see your baby. Different states have different rights for grandparents to see their grandkids (visitation rights) and you will want to see what your states laws are. But, as of now they don't have any right to visit your baby until a time that they are able obtain a court order. \n\nYou could try to slowly ease them in to see if they are a good fit but with the lawsuit threat, that doesn't seem like a good idea.", "NTA. You do what you need to do for you and your child to feel safe. After all - they just tried to leverage the money they sent to help you to try to force you to do what they wanted. This is not the actions of good people who want the best for you, this is the actions of manipulative people who are only looking out for themselves.", "Grandparents don't have the same rights as parents.  The father of your children is in jail, so the only one who can give permission for them to see the kids is you.\n\nIf they want to try to sue you, let them waste their time and money.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to let anyone you don\u2019t trust or know see the baby. Sending the money was only bc they thought they\u2019d see the baby, and now they are trying to manipulate you with it. The court will not make you do anything. I hope you and the baby are doing well", "NTA. Genuine good people don't threaten to sue for grandparents rights 2 weeks after the baby is born. They weren't being nice, they were essentially trying to buy the baby from you, or at least purchase access to the child.", "You dont trust them enough to let them see their grandchild - even via photos - but you are happy to take their money. Yeah, YTA.", "They can try to take her to court but they have no legal leg to stand on. That is not how grandparent\u2019s rights work.", "But then why did she accept money from them?", "What makes them dangerous?", "Sorry, but they proved they were just trying to buy access to the baby. She has every right to decide who is or is not in this child's life, and if they really were understanding of what their son put OP through they wouldn't have threatened to take her to court. They would have tried to build up trust and waited until OP was ready to take that step.", "Why would it?", "They won't be laughed out. Grandparents sue for visitation more often then you know and a majority of the time, they win visitation. And the fact she accepted help from them will not work in her favor.", "They actually have more legal leg to stand on because their son is in jail- which is a special circumstance.", "Nothing. OP expressed concern for her child\u2019s safety and it is perfectly reasonable to get to know them separately without the baby before introducing the baby if you\u2019re concerned. OP doesn\u2019t seem to know them in any real way and she\u2019s allowed to lead with caution", "And yet she gladly accepted their money!  If she doesn't want a relationship she doesn't get to mooch off of them anymore either.", "But why accept money from someone you don\u2019t trust?", "Some colo rectal surgeon said that it did and that got me confused.", "What kind of law allows people who aren't the parents to force themselves on someone's kids??? \n\nIf that's the case, I hope OP can use the fact that they raised her abuser against them in court. \n\nWow! That's disturbing", "Visitation is  granted in the majority of cases when there is a connection and pre-existing relationship with the child which in this case there is none. \n\nNTA, fact of the matter is  since they thought it\u2019s a good idea to threaten OP with court when they did not get their way do not let them have any contact with a child; do not give them an in into your life.  And it raised serious question to me that the minute things did not go they want it. They decide to take to act like this.", "Cautious of what", "It depends on the state if they recognize them or not. Some do if the parents are unmarried or deceased parent. Other states don\u2019t no matter the situation.", "They are the GRANDPARENTS, they aren't random people- grandparents can petition for visitation in all 50 states- it's called grandparents rights. \n\nThem raising an abuser doesn't hurt them- unless OP can prove they abused the son and that's why he turned out that way but it sounds like that's not the case here. They can also get supervised visitation if the judge thinks they could be of harm. But either way, they can get a court ordered visit. And if OP can't afford to fight them in court, it will not turn out in her favor at all.", "\"majority\" isn't all and again, it varies by state to state. The argument here is that grandparents never got the opportunity to establish a relationship based on their son's history and current status. A good lawyer can argue this and if OP is taking money from them, they can (again) establish that OP was willing to let them be  apart when they provided money. All I'm suggesting is OP either work it out with them or be prepared for court, and she's better trying to find a solution with them where she has a say than go to court where she may end up having none.", "And it's up to each state to enforce the order from another state.", ">They are the GRANDPARENTS, they aren't random people-\n\nDefinitely a legal standpoint I find disturbing. But that's a legislative issue I guess. Personally, I don't believe it's right to force parents to have their kids around people they don't choose to. If they aren't mandated to have some responsibility for the kids, why should they be mandated to contact? They aren't their children. They already had their own kids. \n\nBut again, that's a legal issue, and feelings don't matter in the law.", "I find it strange that you find it strange that grandparents can get visitation to kids who exists partly due to them having the parents. Are you American? I don't mean this to be shady but I wonder if you live in a place or part of a culture where grandparents aren't important or recognized for what could be their significant presence in a child's life.", "I'm an American, yes. And it looks like a court order can be complicated, if they live in different states. Which may help in OP's situation. And only the other parent can keep the custodial parent from leaving the state. \n\n>I find it strange that you find it strange that grandparents can get visitation to kids\n\nI find it strange, because I feel it tramples parental rights. Grandparents given rights, without responsibility, doesn't sit well with me.", "Only a few states have grandparent right laws that have any real teeth in them. OP should seek illegal opinion on that issue, but until they actually make a move in this direction, she needs to play things very carefully. It does sound as if they don't support what their son did.", "Parents rights is a bullshit concept.", "One thing I see as I'm looking it up, is that there are no automatic rights granted to grandparents in the states. They HAVE to petition for visitation if the parents don't want to have them around.", "So you don't believe parents have a right to raise their kids how they see fit? And to choose who they are exposed to? Do tell... I'm legit curious about your stance here.", "That is true. Different states are more or less inclined to grant these privileges. It's something that a local attorney would be better able to address. It can even boil down to which judge happens to get assigned the case when a petition is filed, but a local attorney would be able to advise how the case law in OP's jurisdiction runs.", "Parental rights is why we have a fucked society and out of control kids. \n\nParents have a responsibility to act in their child\u2019s best interest in all things at all times, based in evidence, not their feels. Connection to family is shown to be in a child\u2019s best interest."]}
