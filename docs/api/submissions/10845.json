They can also get supervised visitation if the judge thinks they could be of harm. But either way, they can get a court ordered visit. And if OP can't afford to fight them in court, it will not turn out in her favor at all.", "\"majority\" isn't all and again, it varies by state to state. The argument here is that grandparents never got the opportunity to establish a relationship based on their son's history and current status. A good lawyer can argue this and if OP is taking money from them, they can (again) establish that OP was willing to let them be  apart when they provided money. All I'm suggesting is OP either work it out with them or be prepared for court, and she's better trying to find a solution with them where she has a say than go to court where she may end up having none.", "And it's up to each state to enforce the order from another state.", ">They are the GRANDPARENTS, they aren't random people-\n\nDefinitely a legal standpoint I find disturbing. But that's a legislative issue I guess. Personally, I don't believe it's right to force parents to have their kids around people they don't choose to. If they aren't mandated to have some responsibility for the kids, why should they be mandated to contact? They aren't their children. They already had their own kids. \n\nBut again, that's a legal issue, and feelings don't matter in the law.", "I find it strange that you find it strange that grandparents can get visitation to kids who exists partly due to them having the parents.

And only the other parent can keep the custodial parent from leaving the state. \n\n>I find it strange that you find it strange that grandparents can get visitation to kids\n\nI find it strange, because I feel it tramples parental rights. Grandparents given rights, without responsibility, doesn't sit well with me.", "Only a few states have grandparent right laws that have any real teeth in them.

And to choose who they are exposed to? Do tell... I'm legit curious about your stance here.", "That is true. Different states are more or less inclined to grant these privileges.

There are even apps designed specifically for communicating regarding child visits and such, and agencies that will handle supervised visits. The grandparents can be a valuable resource and the kind of love and nurturing that kids can get from their grandparents is invaluable.

A judge would be held liable for allowing visitation to a known abuser.", "If somebody threatened to take me to court about a grandchild they'd never met and had zero legal right to, that'd be the last time they had the privilege of communicating with me.\n\nIANAL but I've been a paralegal in family law for decades.  They don't have a leg to stand on. For your own peace of mind, consult with a lawyer. Block them everywhere. \n\nNTA. Congratulations on your little one!", "Sounds like the apple didn\u2019t fall far from the abusive tree. NTA.", "NTA. This may be a reach, but several times abusers have found information and got access to their victims through mutual friends and family members. They could expose your child and you back to the toxicity. They also are already trying to bully you", "Regardless of what you decide, I'd advocate that you DO NOT let them find out where you are living. They can't (accidentally or purposely) let your ex know where you are if they don't know themselves. NTA", "NTA given the circumstances and your lack of relationship with them. However\u2026 it\u2019s not okay to sit there and take money or baby supplies from them for your baby and then turn around and tell them they can\u2019t meet their grandchild. You can\u2019t pick and choose when they\u2019re allowed be grandparents. If you don\u2019t want them to meet the child, that\u2019s fine but you should give them back the money they sent you or money for supplies they bought you. Because they\u2019re right, it\u2019s not fair. I\u2019m guessing you didn\u2019t tell them when they did those things they wouldn\u2019t be meeting their grandchild.", "So, you're NTA for this, you're dealing with a lot right now. It's totally reasonable to wait for you to have more time recover from child birth and for the situation to otherwise cool down regardless of whether you eventually choose to let them see your child or not, right?\n\nI'm wondering, is there any harm in sending photos? If not, is there a reason to decline sending the photos?\n\nNow, visits, that's a whole 'nother can of worms because their son, who they still have communication with, is dangerous, as in life-threatening dangerous. IF you decide to permit visits, you want to consult with counsel first. I'm sure you have some sort of advocate to speak with given that there were criminal charges, if not, there are a bazillion people in this thread. Grandparents CAN be a valuable resource, and provide a bunch of love.\n\nBut remember, someone messed that boy of theirs up. Sometimes it is the parents, and the apple didn't fall far from the tree, and sometimes great parents just managed to have a total jerkface of a kid.\n\nEither way, they're going to have to build up trust, you've been through a lot at the hands of their son, and trust comes with time and good faith actions. There are agencies that can provide supervised visitation services. I suggest using one of them if you allow visits. IF. But this is something, again, I recommend you take time to decide on. And you can't make the best decisions with them bothering you on your phone when you're healing from child birth, and still have the fresh scars of your ex's abuse that you're dealing with. So they just need to take a step back and give you some space. I am SURE someone will be happy to help you word it better than that, if you choose to go that route.\n\nOh, and them saying they're going to take you to court for grandparents' rights, they don't even know what they're talking about. That's not going to hurt you, it's just going to waste a bunch of their time and money if they aren't laughed at by a lawyer. You can do a search for grandparents rights in your state, and you'll see what I'm talking about. It didn't help them win any points with you, that's for sure!", "Well, clearly you were right not to trust them! Don\u2019t let his horrible family anywhere near your precious baby!", "NTA", "Girl YTA! \n\nThey are not accountable for his abuse towards you! They certainly probably didn\u2019t agree w any of his choices he\u2019s previously made; which is more than likely why he had LC with them! \n\nThey\u2019re at least trying to be a support system for you & their grandchild. They weren\u2019t aware of his abuse towards you and even tried to step in and make up for it. It\u2019s as simple as having a supervised visit to break the ice & set the necessary boundaries then! \n\nTaking their money for the baby and refusing to let them meet said child is bitter and petty! Ma\u2019am you accepted all contributions for the baby; depending on your state they can take you to court for visitation and will win! \n\nYou should think about this thoroughly! This may be something to come back and bite you in the ass later.", "YTA - by taking their money you basically led them on, made them feel like they were involved, in caring for the child, so you can\u2019t seriously be shocked they would want more?! I don\u2019t accept drinks from random men for this same reason, I don\u2019t want to give any man an excuse to feel like I owe them, you gave the grandparent a reason to \u201cowe\u201d them by taking that support. I would give the money back if I were you and never speak to them again, it would look better in court too. You don\u2019t trust them enough to show them a picture of the baby but you trusted them enough to not want anything in return for the money they gave? From people who raised an abuser? Make it make sense.", "NTA. I understand why you did what you did. But I also do understand that the grandparents would want to see the baby. Maybe send them pictures if you feel up to it but ultimately it is your kid", "NTA but don\u2019t cut them off completely; schedule supervise visits and create boundaries according to your comfort level. If you don\u2019t know them, meet them first without the baby (let them know) and slowly and carefully invite them in your life.", "Also, OP, generally grandparents\u2019 rights aren\u2019t guaranteed unless said grandparents have already had access to the child and taking visitation away would cause undue harm to the child. I doubt they would be able to do anything through the justice system.\n\nBut just to be safe, get a lawyer and keep everything in writing. Threats like the ones they\u2019ve already made won\u2019t help them in court. I would also work with a lawyer to figure out what your ex will be allowed to do when he gets out of prison and how you can keep his rights to a minimum. You likely won\u2019t be able to keep the kid from him entirely, and abusers love using children as a tool to continue to manipulate and abuse their former partner.\n\nNTA, OP. But be careful. It seems like you already are being careful, and like you\u2019re doing your best to be a good mom, which is the most important thing. Take care of yourself and your precious baby! Congratulations, by the way!", "In a public place with lots a big friends If you even think about a meet the baby.", "> I know baby\u2019s only 2 weeks or so but they may just be extremely excited to mast their grandchild.\n\nBecause it's *normal* to express excitement by making threats!", "You don't get to tell people dealing with fleeing an abusive relationship and navigating new parenthood at the same time to calm down. Yikes", "If OP is worried about \"grandparents' rights\" -- which exist in some jurisdictions, often limited to cases where the child's PARENTS are split, but in other jurisdictions *don't exist at law* \\-- she can hold off on the visits until she checks with a competent family lawyer.\n\nSince OP wisely gives no clue here as to where she lives, hence jurisdiction, nobody on Reddit can give her useful advice on that issue.", "Do we visit the crimes of the parent on the child now?\n\nSome kids just turn out bad. They clearly don\u2019t agree with their child\u2019s actions. The idea that they should be responsible for his sins is laughable. \n\nIf she wants to cut ties that bad, she should never have accepted gifts and money from them.", "No, but if they are afraid of being blocked because of their son. I\u2019m not saying they are right I\u2019m just giving different possibility of reactions on their part. They apparently provided a fair amount for the baby but that could have been a conscience easer or hoping not to be cut out.  Still think she needs to check laws on grandparents to protect herself.", "So, uhm, how is that threatening? Because for something to be threatening, it has to be a threat to cause harm. Saying you're going to ask for the right to visit your grandchild isn't a threat to cause harm, it is not threatening.\n\nYou keep using that word, it does not mean what you think it means. :-)", "What are you even going on about? That's literally not what happened at all.", "Of course they are.  Bullying her is abusive.  Threatening her is abusive,", "But they can give gifts.  That is what they did.", "Since they're already bullying her and threatening to take her to court when the baby isn't even two weeks old, I think she's right to be cautious.  Don't you?", "I\u2019ll assume that\u2019s a no.", "Your first paragraph was you mocking the idea this woman would be hesitant to deal with ex's parents because they threatened to take her to court, my comment applies perfectly \ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4d", "There was no suggestion that OP had any form of relationship with these people other than them giving her some cash supporting her pregnancy. Even a bad lawyer could argue that this was due from the absent father and is otherwise construed to be bribing the mother for access to the child\u2026 which is exactly what\u2019s happened.", "They haven\u2019t done either.", "I give gifts to my nephew and niece. On the assumption that we have a familial relationship. \n\nWere my husband and I prevented from that, I would much rather my money go to children who need it, rather than children who are already insanely privileged. I give because they are my nephew and niece and I enjoy being part of a family. \n\nBut if I don\u2019t get to be part of that, I\u2019d rather my money go to kids on actual need.", "LOL You keep asking meaningless questions. ;-) Did your freeble gobbledygook?", "Nah, I was mocking NakedStreets for pearl clutching, as though the grandparents saying they were going to ask a court to give them visits was going to be anything other than a ginormous waste of time and money on their part if they actually did it. And now I'm kind of laughing at you for using the typical attack that you like to use falsely claiming \"YOU do NOT get to TELL a WOMAN to CALM DOWN beCUZ U are AN EVUL MALE\" when I did nothing of the sort. Sorting out grandparent visitation, IF OP even wants to agree with it, isn't something she should be even considering doing right now, 2 weeks post-partum, after dealing with a dangerously abusive partner. It's something she shouldn't be getting pestered by the grandparents about either right now, and it's DEFINITELY something that should be sorted out with an advocate on her side. But hey, you're anti-mom, I get that.", "Bullied her to try to see the baby, threatened her by saying they're taking her to court for visitation rights claiming that since they gave her baby stuff she owes them. They, in fact, have done both.", "They threatened to take OP to court before the baby was even two weeks old.  If they weren't guilty of anything before that, they're certainly guilty of being assholes now.", "They want to see their grandchild and are exercising their legal rights. \n\nIf she wanted nothing to do with them, she should not have accepted their financial assistance.", "How so?", "They've never met the child and dad isn't in the picture. Mom doesn't want them around her kid....they have no rights.\n\nLike someone said above- if dad wasn't locked up he would owe child support, the parents are paying it forward. I wouldn't trust his parents either, their son has to learn his shit somewhere."]}
