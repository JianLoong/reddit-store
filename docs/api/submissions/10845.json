While you're doing that ask about his parents and what rights they may or may not have and determine your plan of action there.

Other states don\u2019t no matter the situation.", "They are the GRANDPARENTS, they aren't random people- grandparents can petition for visitation in all 50 states- it's called grandparents rights. \n\nThem raising an abuser doesn't hurt them- unless OP can prove they abused the son and that's why he turned out that way but it sounds like that's not the case here. They can also get supervised visitation if the judge thinks they could be of harm. But either way, they can get a court ordered visit. And if OP can't afford to fight them in court, it will not turn out in her favor at all.", "\"majority\" isn't all and again, it varies by state to state. The argument here is that grandparents never got the opportunity to establish a relationship based on their son's history and current status. A good lawyer can argue this and if OP is taking money from them, they can (again) establish that OP was willing to let them be  apart when they provided money. All I'm suggesting is OP either work it out with them or be prepared for court, and she's better trying to find a solution with them where she has a say than go to court where she may end up having none.", "And it's up to each state to enforce the order from another state.", ">They are the GRANDPARENTS, they aren't random people-\n\nDefinitely a legal standpoint I find disturbing. But that's a legislative issue I guess. Personally, I don't believe it's right to force parents to have their kids around people they don't choose to. If they aren't mandated to have some responsibility for the kids, why should they be mandated to contact? They aren't their children. They already had their own kids. \n\nBut again, that's a legal issue, and feelings don't matter in the law.", "I find it strange that you find it strange that grandparents can get visitation to kids who exists partly due to them having the parents.

And only the other parent can keep the custodial parent from leaving the state. \n\n>I find it strange that you find it strange that grandparents can get visitation to kids\n\nI find it strange, because I feel it tramples parental rights. Grandparents given rights, without responsibility, doesn't sit well with me.", "Only a few states have grandparent right laws that have any real teeth in them.

It does sound as if they don't support what their son did.", "Parents rights is a bullshit concept.", "One thing I see as I'm looking it up, is that there are no automatic rights granted to grandparents in the states. They HAVE to petition for visitation if the parents don't want to have them around.", "So you don't believe parents have a right to raise their kids how they see fit? And to choose who they are exposed to? Do tell... I'm legit curious about your stance here.", "That is true. Different states are more or less inclined to grant these privileges.

For god's sake, you've been through emotional hell, and this is how they act? The absolute lack of sensitivity is cruel and shocking. These are not people who encourage trust of any kind. Maybe they're just in a weird emotional place given all that has happened. Maybe you can build a relationship with them eventually, if you want. But this initial reaction is bursting with red flags.\n\n\u2022  You say they purchased supplies and have given you money. What, a few hundred or thousand dollars? Really, the amount doesn't matter.

You worry that you are being harsh. You're second-guessing yourself, ready to blame yourself. To me, this sounds like the reactions of a person who's been abused.

The grandparents can be a valuable resource and the kind of love and nurturing that kids can get from their grandparents is invaluable.

But they didn't ask for anything until after the fact. She is free to say yes or no to the request without consideration of the past gifts. I'll bet the ex gave a gift or two during the relationship, back when he was in love bombing stage. Is she morally obliged to let him visit with the baby? Hell no. Gifts are not a wedge.
