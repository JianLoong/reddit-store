SHE'S the one being extremely disrespectful tell her to mind her own goddamn business.", "NTA.  Sounds like Natalie has some personal issues.  You\u2019re young, so you may or may not have encountered someone like that before, so this is super confusing/jarring.  Just forget about it and don\u2019t take it personally if you can.  It\u2019s great you were able to stand up for yourself and you have a supportive husband by your side.", "NTA in my opinion: \nShe seems jealous that you get more time to unpack.  To me the fact she brought up your husband being mad about it taking longer than she had is making me think this way. She was probably called lazy. I don't think the husband because he just walked away instead of agreeing with her, maybe her family? \nAnd her husband walking away has me believe you're NTA and she has someone else making her feel it had to be done asap. \nI like to put things away where they will stay once I move so I don't have to keep moving things.\nAnd bad knees suck for moving especially with steps making you wear out faster. Last time I moved I brushed the tendons in my knee because of the stairs and rushing to get out of a bad situation.", "NTA- whatever her deal was that night- it is not okay for her to treat you like shit. She straight up called you lazy. She turned unpacking into a contest. Like who the hell cares? How does it really matter in the long run if it takes two days, a week or a month? \n\nJust let it roll off your back. Hopefully she will apologize in a day or two.", "There is no question here. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA\n\nShe was trying to knock you down a peg and play on any insecurities she could find. She thinks she is the Alpha female and is trying to dominate you! \n\nShe is simply a bully!  \n\nShe isn\u2019t your friend. \n\nDon\u2019t overthink it.  You did nothing. You can\u2019t be friends with bullies or people who try to intimidate and belittle people!", "NTA and don't feel bad. She is an idiot and not worth your time or even one thought. Forget about her. I like your answer to her, some people are just so annoying.", "NTA!!! Natalie sounds like a complete AH. Why on earth would she joke about that? Honestly I would have left too. I have long lasting back issues and get this shit once in a while and just have zero tolerance for it anymore. I tell people just wait until you have an injury and I'll come by and tell you you're lazy", "Someone accused me of being a troll on another post I posted on Reddit.

If it\u2019s because I didn\u2019t put more detail, that is 100% on me and I should\u2019ve added more details. i just didn\u2019t want to carry on the post much longer than I already have. this was only my second post on Reddit that I\u2019ve ever posted, so I didn\u2019t really know what to include and what not to without making it extremely long.

If she was just having a bad day, it's on her to approach you, make her excuses/apologies, and do better going forward.\n\nSociety tells women that we always have be pleasant, make compromises, be the bigger person, be nice ... even if it means accepting someone treating us badly. There's no need to cater to someone who has behaved obnoxiously toward you.\n\nI'd stick with cool politeness and basic courtesy. If she somehow doesn't realize that she was being offensive and she actually does want a friendship, she'll come to you.\n\nBased on her husband's reaction, my guess is that catty, judgemental BS is her wheelhouse. Do you really want to waste your energy attempting to form an actual friendship with someone like that?", "Definitely not.  You can be courteous, but don\u2019t go out of your way to be her friend.  You are new in town, and you don\u2019t need to start building your social network by aligning yourself with one of the local Mean Girls.

Apparently her husband knows it, considering the \u201cnot again\u201d walk  away.", "NTA. I would have attributed it to maybe her husband was an AH, but he just walked away, aka knows she is an AH. So she is TA and you just need to shush her shit. Eff her needy, look at me b/s.", "[removed]", "NTA. Also tell your husband to stop telling his friend about things that are happening in the home because he's clearly sharing that with his wife. Now that you both know that the wife is using that information to throw it in your face that needs to stop. Also go no contact with her. Just because your husband has a friend doesn't mean your obligated to be friends with that person's wife.", "NTA. You just met one is all. Assholes suck.", "NTA.\nshe sounds like she has some major insecurities.", "Nta.  But truthfully these are the people to feel sorry for.  How sad is it that she needs to feel better about something so she attacks you about something so trivial.", "NTA she sounds Mean Girl\u2122 who peaked in highschool and is now just looking for a new punching bag", "NTA. What a b!\n\nI'm glad your husband took your side.\n\nI don't trust this girl. I reckon she is jealous of you, something negative is going on in her life or she's after your husband.", "NTA\n\nHer own husband didn't think it was funny, so it definitely wasn't okay for her to be nagging you when you have chronic pain holding you back. People without chronic pain don't get it.", "NTA \n\nShe doesn't sound like a nice person. She wanted to put you down to make herself look better. That isn't someone who is worth your time.", "She was rude. Her husband was embarrassed by her rudeness - I bet she's done it before - your husband supports you and you did nothing wrong in both unpacking at your own pace and how you dealt with her. At least you know nice and early this is not someone you want to be friends with and won't waste any more time on her. NTA.", "NTA at all. This comes from someone whos been through three dislocations and two knee surgerys before 16.

Your efforts and energy are better spent elsewhere.", "Don't give her a second chance- this kind of super aggressive rudeness isn't an accident. It's not a bad day. It's literally bananas to be that psycho-insulting, like, did you unknowingly kill her sister when a house fell on her? She's not having a bad day- for whatever reason, she hates you. Think about it, would you EVER treat anyone like this? Of course not! Do find out what the hell that was about if you can, and please update us! I'm intrigued...and God, whatever is going on here, I sense it's going to be a doozy.", "A wise woman once said, \"when people show you who they are, believe them the first time.\" It's something to think about.

She\u2019s a lunatic.", "I think now is the perfect time in your life to learn the difference between being polite and being a friend. You can give people grace and be polite in social situations (no rolling eyes, hellos and goodbyes etc.) without investing time and energy into being a friend or being generous and kind.", "Don't waste your energy OP, honestly. It's not worth it.", "Maybe she has social anxiety? I suffer from it, and it causes me to sometimes say things without thinking. Followed by me trying to make a desperate attempt at humor (sometimes poking a little fun at the other person) without thinking. When I get this way, my husband gives me a stern disapproving look to get me to stop (which is what I think the husband did to her). After I get the hint, I immediately try to change the subject and I\u2019m completely embarrassed. \n\nIf she does have social anxiety, she\u2019s probably rethinking the whole event in her head, on repeat. \n\nNTA and you def don\u2019t owe her anything. But if you want to find out why she was acting that way, perhaps talk to her and explain your side with no apologies for your actions. \n\nBest of luck \ud83e\udd1e"]}
