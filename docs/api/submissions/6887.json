I am so happy that I made a post, because honestly most of these comments are the best advice I\u2019ve received so far, even after speaking with friends. i think I will definitely cut contact with her. I will say some people think that my husband is complaining to them, and as that would honestly make sense, it\u2019s not true. he also has knee pains and knows how it feels because he goes through the same things I do except his hasn\u2019t lead to all the extra stuff. he\u2019s very very supportive, and honestly is the sweetest person ever as we both always communicate very well. i do appreciate most concern on that part though! again thank you all.
