I am so happy that I made a post, because honestly most of these comments are the best advice I\u2019ve received so far, even after speaking with friends. i think I will definitely cut contact with her. I will say some people think that my husband is complaining to them, and as that would honestly make sense, it\u2019s not true. he also has knee pains and knows how it feels because he goes through the same things I do except his hasn\u2019t lead to all the extra stuff. he\u2019s very very supportive, and honestly is the sweetest person ever as we both always communicate very well. i do appreciate most concern on that part though! again thank you all. I will definitely be no contact with her, and if she decides to apologize I\u2019ll let her but still continue to go about my day. I refuse to let someone in my life that chooses to be malicious towards me.", "NTA.  I've found that people who are jealous of me for whatever reason can be incredibly vicious, which this woman was.  You didn't do anything wrong, though in your shoes, I would have burst out laughing when she made the disrespect comment.\n\nIt's also been my experience that there is nothing you can do to stop her from being jealous.  The only thing that helps is time.", "NTA\n\nIt's clear to me that you need to go no contact with this person forever.  There is something wrong with a person who puts down another.  She's either jealous or envious of you or into your husband.\n\nGo make new friends in your new home and ignore her forever.", "NTA\n\nWow. You barely know this lady and she's criticizing your unpacking skills and calling you lazy?  Then has the nerve to call YOU disrespectful because you stop interacting with her.  BAHAHAHAHA!  Even her husband didn't want anything to do with the conversation. I'm guessing she does this a lot.", "Well those NEW FRIENDS are OLD FRIENDS..\n\nNTA", "NTA\u2026 who cares how long or short it takes you to unpack. I\u2019ve moved a lot and sometimes it takes a week sometimes it takes two months to fully unpack. It\u2019s your home. You don\u2019t even need an explanation. I\u2019m still having a hard time grasping why she bullied you about this (or anything for that matter)", "NTA , your friend\u2019s hubby reacted with a quiet \u201cWTF is wrong with my wife\u201d. I would too. She ridiculed you and your lack of reaction was disrespectful? WTF is wrong with her?", "NTA.  You can\u2019t rationalize crazy so stop trying.", "NTA.  She was bullying you and expected you to be respectful to her? Nope. It's good that you left.", "Op, you could try and have a relationship with her. But trust me, she'll just be a passive aggressive tit. Don't bother. She's not worth your time. \n\nOf course you're NTA. \n\nDon't give the horrible woman a second thought.", "She sees you as a threat. She wanted to ensure her husband didn\u2019t see anything positive in you because she\u2019s that insecure. \n\nBelieve me: he knows exactly how she is. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You weren't \"being disrespectful\" - you were challenging her and she didn't know how to react. \nFurthermore, as someone who suffers with chronic pain, I will say that people who don't often go straight to \"You're lazy\" as a way of trying to explain it to themselves. I had someone who I thought was a good friend lay into me about why I wasn't doing much around the house. She then sent screenshots of this conversation to my husband in a bid to get him to reconsider me. Why isn't she helping? Why can't she do XYZ? \nDon't put yourself in a position where uou have to see this awful person. She's a bully.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds like a PickMe.\n\nYou don't have to do anything wrong to get a PickMe to be jealous of you.\n\nBecause you're a woman, she sees you as her competition. So she's creating a conflict hoping that she'll win. She got mad when her husband didn't help her win and pissed off even more because you didn't take the bait.", "NTA. Unpacking a house is a TON of work. I was pregnant when we moved and couldn\u2019t do anything and it was terrible. I imagine that you feel just as antsy since your knee makes it difficult to move about. She probably didn\u2019t even do it in 2 days.", "NTA. I take longer than 2 days to unpack a bag after travel. She thinks it is a competition when it isn't.", "The thought of fully unpacking my suitcase after a trip in 2 days gives me anxiety let alone a whole house. She must be one of those desperate housewives Bree types (if you're old enough to get the reference yay!!!). \n\nPay her no mind. \n\nTake care of your body and do things at your pace.\n\nNTA  \n You would be if you subject yourself to her company again", "I deal with ME/CFS or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. I am bed bound, and yet every person I open up too just think I'm lazy, unmotivated and just making excuses. It's a rough world, NTA", "As someone who at 26(f) is also suffering with both my knees being bad (dislocated my right one twice but now my left is starting to play up) and having to be strapped up and have a walking stick when going out, you are NTA. You can only do what your knee allows you to do or else it will only make it worse, just because she was able to unpack in 2 days doesn\u2019t mean you can as well. I\u2019m glad your husband had your back with this and I hope that things with your knee improve and your able to do more.", "She wasn't being passive-aggressive, she was being aggressive-aggressive!", "Are we sure OP's husband isn't talking bad about op to his friend? I've seen situations where it  empowers them ( the other couple) to openly criticize, insult,  or mock her.", "Some people are just like that. They say things that are rude without any understanding as to why someone might take offence to it but when that person becomes offended at what they said they will take it as an attack on them.\n\nMy aunt is that way. She is now divorced, and wonders why her kids rarely speak/visit her anymore.", "I would have. Though I cry when I\u2019m angry so it probably would have made her look pretty bad.", "[removed]", "Welcome to the chronic pain and disability while young club, it sucks and the club t-shirt orders keep getting lost in the mail. I wish you luck in finishing unpacking. It's been a year for me and my elderly father and we just keep adding to our collections of \"accidental ouchies while settling in.\" because he keeps forgetting he's almost 80 and I think the boxes are lighter than they appear. They aren't. XD", "I would agree, but personally he would\u2019ve have said anything of that sort because of how upfront he is to me. both of us actually have a bad knee \ud83d\ude05, so that\u2019s exactly why he is so understanding. I actually am in school and working a job, thank you for your concern though.", "Wtf is your problem? Stop making weird assumptions about OP.", "I'm disabled and I've run across many people that are just as nasty as she is with being ableist. \n\nShe's a nasty piece of work that won't get better, not worth your time to be friends with her.\n\nRight now you have a temporary injury, heaven forbid you get a life changing disability, she would get even worse than she is now.\n\nBetter to distance yourself from her.", "NTA she was way out of line and completely rude. Maybe offer to break her knee and see how well she gets around and if she\u2019ll want her husband to be supportive and understanding of her limitations? But seriously does she have no empathy? Has she never been sick or injured before? Her behavior was rude and totally weird. You responded more kindly then I would have. Though I cry when I\u2019m angry so it probably would have made her look pretty bad.", "No someone like that needs to be put in her place. WTAF was her problem?", "Haven\u2019t you ever had someone be jealous of you?

Whatever the reason, that's some threatened behavior for sure.", "Or a lot younger or less overweight.", "She's just a mean person. I wouldn't hang out with her, or go to her house anymore. I'm sure you can find much cooler people to hangout with in your new city.", "Others here are right that trying to figure out \"exactly why\" is at best a bad idea and at worst potentially exposing yourself to a lot more cruelty. Buuut if you really can't contain your curiosity, it's a much better idea to talk with your husband. Ask him if she's done things like this before. Ask him for his take on why she's like this."]}
