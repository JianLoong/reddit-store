My parents are going to pay for the reception because the groom's parents traditionally pay for that but they're paying for everything else themselves. \n\nMy SIL invited me to go dress shopping with her yesterday.

After she bought her clothes she asked to see mine.\n\nI did most of my wedding shopping in India. I have four lehengas, all of which are from a famous Indian bridal designer. The one that I'm wearing to my actual wedding was about $10k USD and all of them cost about $25k put together. Including jewelry and accessories, my wedding outfits cost around $50k. I didn't offer any of this information, my SIL asked me to tell her. \n\nAfter I told her she was pretty shocked and asked if I'm making my parents pay for all that. I'm not, they're paying for two of the dresses and the jewelry but my fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for my reception dress because they're hosting the reception and my mom's brother paid for my wedding dress because the bride's maternal uncle traditionally pays for the wedding dress.\n\nSIL said that just one of my dresses costs more than her's and my wedding is probably going to overshadow her's because mine is two weeks before and the guests are probably going to be talking about how her SIL had nicer dresses and a much more extravagant wedding.

She got upset and left my house looking like she was about to cry. \n\nLater my brother called and said that she's really sad and  should lied or changed the topic. I'm a really bad liar and I don't know how I could have changed the topic when she was there to see my dresses.

I'm sure you will look fabulous!!! Post photos in r/weddingdress if you want to !", "I will say that the type of wedding that op is describing and that this level of extravagant spending is standard for ...80 is honestly the tiniest number I've heard. Even in Covid times. Like the type of wedding SIL is throwing is kind of purposefully simple and extremely low scale in comparison.  If you're not Indian it's probably really hard to understand just how baffling and confusingly weird the 30 additional people is such a problem for sil. This isn't to defend op since I haven't yet read all her comments so i don't know what all she's said yet. \n\nAlso like the 30 extra people not being included will be a huge focal point of gossip at sil's wedding unfortunately.  10 years ago my maternal second cousin got married and the fact that my dad's 5 brothers and their wives and my dad's mom weren't all invited to all the events was tsked tsked by everyone and it still gets talked about. \n\nLike you have to understand from op and her family's perspective SIL and brother are having a wedding that's very unlike the type of wedding and expenses she's now seeming upset at op for during the shopping trip. Like it's bizarre to make many concrete decisions that are contrary to the type of wedding op is having and then be upset that that's the case ? \n\nThe timing is just really unfortunate and awful. I feel so bad for the poor SIL. Indian weddings can be overwhelming at the best of times and she's got a lot of stress to manage with two sets of weddings. And it's really commendable and something I respect that they as a couple are covering their costs on their own. Op shouldn't have called her stupid at all. That's unfair and not cool. She should apologize for sure", "I think the SIL isn\u2019t insecure in the way you might be thinking.  As a biracial bicultural person myself and living through some cultural clashes, I think she\u2019s feeling insecure about the decision she made to forgo the financial assistance from her in-laws. \n\nFrom a white, western standpoint she probably thought she was being a good daughter-in-law by trying not to burden her in-laws with excessive costs.  While some western brides are definitely extravagant, unless they\u2019re from super wealthy families, placing a huge financial burden on parents for a wedding isn\u2019t usually looked upon positively.  It\u2019s often looked at as entitled or taking advantage. \n\nNow she sees OP\u2019s wedding gear and realizes maybe she made a cultural miscalculation and instead of coming across virtuous in her comparative frugality she\u2019s worried she will come across cheap by the standards of the culture she\u2019s marrying into.  \n\nShe was just expressing that then OP called her statements stupid. Again, in my Asian family that sort of bluntness is commonplace and nobody thinks twice about it. But I would have to be really enraged to infer one of my white cousins is being or saying something stupid.  Stupid just isn\u2019t a word that\u2019s tossed around like that on my dad\u2019s side of the family. It\u2019s got more hostile implications.  I\u2019ve observed that kind of bluntness doesn\u2019t seem to go over well in SOME white families. Some don\u2019t care, but some do.  I never figured out why that is.  It\u2019s just something I observed.  I\u2019m sure there are some Asian cultures that aren\u2019t as blunt as the one I came from.  \n\nAnyway, even taking out any cultural issues, it\u2019s always nerve wracking blending two or more different families. Every family has their own sub culture to adjust to.  \n\nGetting back to the original point, I don\u2019t think SIL is jealous exactly. I think she\u2019s worried how she\u2019s presenting herself to her future family.  \n\nI hope that all makes sense. I don\u2019t write very well.", "Uh it's called being a nice person.

Your sweeping comment sounds stupid to me.", ">Indian weddings in general are 10day affairs! \n\nlol this is like saying every American goes to college. Only 40% of Americans have BAs.
