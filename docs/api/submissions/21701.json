We're both getting married within a few weeks of each other. My parents and in-laws are paying for most of my wedding. My brother and SIL decided to pay for their own wedding. My parents are going to pay for the reception because the groom's parents traditionally pay for that but they're paying for everything else themselves. \n\nMy SIL invited me to go dress shopping with her yesterday. She already had her dress for the white wedding and yesterday she bought lehengas (Indian dresses) for the reception and pre-wedding event (she's condensing all the events into one day). After she bought her clothes she asked to see mine.\n\nI did most of my wedding shopping in India. I have four lehengas, all of which are from a famous Indian bridal designer. The one that I'm wearing to my actual wedding was about $10k USD and all of them cost about $25k put together. Including jewelry and accessories, my wedding outfits cost around $50k. I didn't offer any of this information, my SIL asked me to tell her. \n\nAfter I told her she was pretty shocked and asked if I'm making my parents pay for all that. I'm not, they're paying for two of the dresses and the jewelry but my fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for my reception dress because they're hosting the reception and my mom's brother paid for my wedding dress because the bride's maternal uncle traditionally pays for the wedding dress.\n\nSIL said that just one of my dresses costs more than her's and my wedding is probably going to overshadow her's because mine is two weeks before and the guests are probably going to be talking about how her SIL had nicer dresses and a much more extravagant wedding. I said that she's being stupid and hardly anybody will even remember what I wore at my wedding. I'm generally pretty soft spoken and I don't cuss so calling someone stupid is about as harsh as I get. She got upset and left my house looking like she was about to cry. \n\nLater my brother called and said that she's really sad and  should lied or changed the topic. I'm a really bad liar and I don't know how I could have changed the topic when she was there to see my dresses. SIL and I have been good friends since before she was with my brother and she's always been very emotional. She'll probably be over it by Monday at the latest but I feel bad about upsetting her.

When there's that big a disparity between wedding budgets and family support it's usually because there's some underlying tension somewhere. Maybe they just preferred to keep it low key and under their control and she had last minute envy when she saw how luxe your setup is. If she usually calms down, reach out in a couple of days and ask her how she's doing", "NTA - Comparison is the Thief of Joy.\n\nShe really needs to stop that. Focus on herself, her wedding, her day. And get her jealousy under control.\n\nYou and your family made your choices as adults. Everyone consenting adults.\n\nShe and her fiance made their choices in regards to their wedding.\n\nThe conflict is jealousy and comparison. But no. You are NTA", "NTA. She asked for all this and you answered.", "Edit: ESH\n\nYour SIL is being jealous based on the numbers you tell her. She should just mind her own wedding and enjoy attending yours and having hers instead of worrying about the silliest things.\n\nBUT, you shouldn't have called her stupid. That was definitely unnecessary and you should take accountability for that even if she does \"get over it by Monday\". Be responsible for your actions, even if she said something that's ridiculous to you.", "NTA. Don\u2019t ask questions you might not like the answer to.", "NTA\n\nIndian parents just love putting money  towards their children\u2019s weddings but when one kid says no, they basically give up rights to compare against their siblings wedding being more fancy.\n\nP.S: I think parents should put that money in a fund to help the bride/groom kickstart their life together", "NTA, you only answered questions that were asked. Most people don't ask for prices because it's rude.", "YTA, actually. I think your SIL got very anxious about the situation and probably needed some consoling about it. (Because she's right, your wedding will be much more extravagant than hers, she just needed to be reminded of how it shouldn't matter and that she's going to be so lovely too) You didn't have to tell her that her feelings were stupid right to her face and then patronize her about how \"no one will remember what you wore\" when you have 50k worth of outfits.", "ESH\n\nPulling the whole wedding comparison / overshadowing crap is lame of SIL, but you could have dealt with it more politely rather than just saying she is being stupid.", "YTA. You couldn't have simply told your SIL that her wedding will be lovely too and not to worry about yours overshadowing hers? Calling her \"stupid\" was really the best you could do?", "Your SIL is choosing to be superficial, insecure, and competitive. That is hardly your responsibility.

She is a would-be-bride, just like you and is very stressed that familly would prefer your wedding, and not enjoy hers. And your answer to that is to call her stupid ?? rather than simply reassure her. \n\nI got your point, she is being silly, people would still love her wedding, but there were hundred of better way of giving her that message : saying even her clothes didni't cost as much, they are still beautiful ; her venue is wonderful ; the decoration are nice ; having a smaller-size event is more relaxed for all the guests, and she will have more time to spend with each of them ; ...\n\nYou have really no compassion for your futur SIL ...", "Eek. This is a topic that sometimes is better not being talked about. I\u2019m guessing she might feel really bad, or possibly think that your family having 2 weddings so close to each other will do nothing but compare. It\u2019s really hard, and I definitely can see both sides.\n\nNAH. She asked, you answered. And now she feels bad. I would just try and remind her that her wedding to your brother will be exactly as she pictured it to be, and their perfect day. Nobody will compare because they are completely different groups of people. Try and be supportive! Congratulations to you both.", "ESH. All of this is tacky.", "YTA.  You didn't need to lie, it is what it is, and it's not like she wouldn't have seen the dresses anyway, at your wedding.  But calling her stupid was pretty callous.  You're having two weddings within two weeks of one another, yours first, and it sounds like your is going to be far more extravagant.  While weddings shouldn't be a competition, this has almost been engineered to be one.  It's kind of understandable that she would be shocked and feel a little like the second-runner-up in a beauty pageant at seeing the level of spending, a level utterly impossible for most people.  I'm not saying you needed to economize for her sake -- it is your wedding, and you can do as you like -- but you kind of kicked her when she was down.  It would have been one thing if she had thrown a tantrum, but it sounds like she was mostly trying to process the shock, and said how she felt without being mean.", "YTA for calling her stupid.\n\nShe was feeling insecure and only needed you to reassure her that her wedding would be beautiful.", "NAH.

So even though her insecurity isn't awesome, you're the bigger AH here.\n\nAlso, $50k just on your outfits?

Discussing what things cost is pretty crass.", "I have no idea why you just had to jump in and called her stupid after she was worried that you\u2019d overshadow her wedding, you could\u2019ve just reassured her or just said oh I\u2019m sure yours will be lovely. You were really being an agitator, do you hate her?", "Stop talking about money to anyone. Only partners should discuss details", "ESH.
