My parents are going to pay for the reception because the groom's parents traditionally pay for that but they're paying for everything else themselves. \n\nMy SIL invited me to go dress shopping with her yesterday.

After she bought her clothes she asked to see mine.\n\nI did most of my wedding shopping in India. I have four lehengas, all of which are from a famous Indian bridal designer. The one that I'm wearing to my actual wedding was about $10k USD and all of them cost about $25k put together. Including jewelry and accessories, my wedding outfits cost around $50k. I didn't offer any of this information, my SIL asked me to tell her. \n\nAfter I told her she was pretty shocked and asked if I'm making my parents pay for all that. I'm not, they're paying for two of the dresses and the jewelry but my fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for my reception dress because they're hosting the reception and my mom's brother paid for my wedding dress because the bride's maternal uncle traditionally pays for the wedding dress.\n\nSIL said that just one of my dresses costs more than her's and my wedding is probably going to overshadow her's because mine is two weeks before and the guests are probably going to be talking about how her SIL had nicer dresses and a much more extravagant wedding.

She got upset and left my house looking like she was about to cry. \n\nLater my brother called and said that she's really sad and  should lied or changed the topic. I'm a really bad liar and I don't know how I could have changed the topic when she was there to see my dresses.

If you noticed the brides uncle pays for something too, usually gold (some traditions it\u2019s the nose ring plus a traditional bangle set that is worn for 40 days after the wedding). The reception is usually the cost of the groom family. This is how it is and I am pretty sure the SIL has already been told this.\n\nClearly the SIL opted for the same thing you\u2019d rather\u2026 so then why should she feel super upset, she made that choice.
