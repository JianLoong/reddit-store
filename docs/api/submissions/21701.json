We're both getting married within a few weeks of each other. My parents and in-laws are paying for most of my wedding. My brother and SIL decided to pay for their own wedding. My parents are going to pay for the reception because the groom's parents traditionally pay for that but they're paying for everything else themselves. \n\nMy SIL invited me to go dress shopping with her yesterday. She already had her dress for the white wedding and yesterday she bought lehengas (Indian dresses) for the reception and pre-wedding event (she's condensing all the events into one day). After she bought her clothes she asked to see mine.\n\nI did most of my wedding shopping in India. I have four lehengas, all of which are from a famous Indian bridal designer. The one that I'm wearing to my actual wedding was about $10k USD and all of them cost about $25k put together. Including jewelry and accessories, my wedding outfits cost around $50k. I didn't offer any of this information, my SIL asked me to tell her. \n\nAfter I told her she was pretty shocked and asked if I'm making my parents pay for all that. I'm not, they're paying for two of the dresses and the jewelry but my fianc\u00e9's parents are paying for my reception dress because they're hosting the reception and my mom's brother paid for my wedding dress because the bride's maternal uncle traditionally pays for the wedding dress.\n\nSIL said that just one of my dresses costs more than her's and my wedding is probably going to overshadow her's because mine is two weeks before and the guests are probably going to be talking about how her SIL had nicer dresses and a much more extravagant wedding. I said that she's being stupid and hardly anybody will even remember what I wore at my wedding. I'm generally pretty soft spoken and I don't cuss so calling someone stupid is about as harsh as I get. She got upset and left my house looking like she was about to cry. \n\nLater my brother called and said that she's really sad and  should lied or changed the topic. I'm a really bad liar and I don't know how I could have changed the topic when she was there to see my dresses. SIL and I have been good friends since before she was with my brother and she's always been very emotional. She'll probably be over it by Monday at the latest but I feel bad about upsetting her. AITA?\n\nEDIT: My fianc\u00e9 and I chose our date first. Our birthdays are one day apart and we decided to get married on the day in between. My brother and SIL chose their date because it wasn\u2019t as expensive as the other dates they considered and the weather is good in their honeymoon destination around that time of year.\n\nEDIT 2: I\u2019ve realized that even if I\u2019m NTA I\u2019d rather not risk losing my friendship with her over something so minor. I\u2019m going to call her in the morning and apologize.", "created_utc": 1688853973, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ugw7l/aita_for_calling_my_sil_stupid_after_she_got/", "score": 3485, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm sure you will look fabulous!!! Post photos in r/weddingdress if you want to !", "I will say that the type of wedding that op is describing and that this level of extravagant spending is standard for ...80 is honestly the tiniest number I've heard. Even in Covid times. Like the type of wedding SIL is throwing is kind of purposefully simple and extremely low scale in comparison.  If you're not Indian it's probably really hard to understand just how baffling and confusingly weird the 30 additional people is such a problem for sil. This isn't to defend op since I haven't yet read all her comments so i don't know what all she's said yet. \n\nAlso like the 30 extra people not being included will be a huge focal point of gossip at sil's wedding unfortunately.  10 years ago my maternal second cousin got married and the fact that my dad's 5 brothers and their wives and my dad's mom weren't all invited to all the events was tsked tsked by everyone and it still gets talked about. \n\nLike you have to understand from op and her family's perspective SIL and brother are having a wedding that's very unlike the type of wedding and expenses she's now seeming upset at op for during the shopping trip. Like it's bizarre to make many concrete decisions that are contrary to the type of wedding op is having and then be upset that that's the case ? \n\nThe timing is just really unfortunate and awful. I feel so bad for the poor SIL. Indian weddings can be overwhelming at the best of times and she's got a lot of stress to manage with two sets of weddings. And it's really commendable and something I respect that they as a couple are covering their costs on their own. Op shouldn't have called her stupid at all. That's unfair and not cool. She should apologize for sure", "I think the SIL isn\u2019t insecure in the way you might be thinking.  As a biracial bicultural person myself and living through some cultural clashes, I think she\u2019s feeling insecure about the decision she made to forgo the financial assistance from her in-laws. \n\nFrom a white, western standpoint she probably thought she was being a good daughter-in-law by trying not to burden her in-laws with excessive costs.  While some western brides are definitely extravagant, unless they\u2019re from super wealthy families, placing a huge financial burden on parents for a wedding isn\u2019t usually looked upon positively.  It\u2019s often looked at as entitled or taking advantage. \n\nNow she sees OP\u2019s wedding gear and realizes maybe she made a cultural miscalculation and instead of coming across virtuous in her comparative frugality she\u2019s worried she will come across cheap by the standards of the culture she\u2019s marrying into.  \n\nShe was just expressing that then OP called her statements stupid. Again, in my Asian family that sort of bluntness is commonplace and nobody thinks twice about it. But I would have to be really enraged to infer one of my white cousins is being or saying something stupid.  Stupid just isn\u2019t a word that\u2019s tossed around like that on my dad\u2019s side of the family. It\u2019s got more hostile implications.  I\u2019ve observed that kind of bluntness doesn\u2019t seem to go over well in SOME white families. Some don\u2019t care, but some do.  I never figured out why that is.  It\u2019s just something I observed.  I\u2019m sure there are some Asian cultures that aren\u2019t as blunt as the one I came from.  \n\nAnyway, even taking out any cultural issues, it\u2019s always nerve wracking blending two or more different families. Every family has their own sub culture to adjust to.  \n\nGetting back to the original point, I don\u2019t think SIL is jealous exactly. I think she\u2019s worried how she\u2019s presenting herself to her future family.  \n\nI hope that all makes sense. I don\u2019t write very well.", "Uh it's called being a nice person.

But... it isn't very nice to call someone stupid, especially when you are clearly going to have a much bigger, more expensive wedding. \n\nI hope your parents do something like help pay for a nice honeymoon or help with a downpayment for a first house to make the amount of money they contribute to both weddings equitable.", "YTA\u2026 But gently and unintentionally. Let me explain. First. She won\u2019t be your SIL until after she marries your brother, so that was confusing to understand the dynamics. Also, I really hope your parents are paying equally for your brother\u2019s wedding and your wedding. The dynamic there sounds a bit awkward to my ears as well. \n\nSecond, you are insanely privileged to be wearing $50,000 worth of wedding gear. I\u2019m not holding that privilege against you. I\u2019m guessing your \u201cSIL\u201d is from a normal middle-class family, who would absolutely balk at the thought of that paying that much for the bride\u2019s outfit. It is shocking to hear that you have asked your familly, or in-laws, to shell out that much for clothing and jewellry for a wedding ceremony. I get that it\u2019s a cultural thing, I\u2019ve been to multiple Indian weddings and understand that they are insanely lavish and parents literally shell out lifetime savings for them. But it is shocking to hear for people like me, from middle-class or even upper-middle class backgrounds who spend a fraction of the cost of your wedding attire on our entire wedding, and often have parents unwilling to pay anything (I paid for my entire wedding, but I got married last year at the age of 32 and just didn\u2019t want to ask my family or my wife\u2019s dad to shell out thousands for us). My wife\u2019s dad paid $50,000 for my wife\u2019s sister\u2019s wedding, and he offered to pay $25,000 for ours (my wife is bitter that he has always given more to her older sister), I rejected the offer and instead we are purchasing his old house and he\u2019s knocking what he was willing to pay for the wedding off of the sales price. I am much happier with that. I don\u2019t understand how people can feel pride, jealousy, or embarrassment over a god damn wedding, how much you spend on your wedding doesn\u2019t make you better or worse than someone (and how much YOUR PARENTS spend is even less of a reflection of your worth lol). \n\nLastly, the interaction: You weren\u2019t in the wrong for telling her how much your wedding attire costs. But I\u2019m guessing her reaction (which was absolutely what you should expect when sharing those details) made you feel ashamed and embarrassed about how privileged you are, compared to her. So calling her stupid was you reacting to your own shame, trying to repress your guilt and instead make it seem like she was being stupid. And it is actually you who sounded stupid. You said nobody would remember what you wore to your wedding, but you are asking family to pay $50K for it? Holy fuck\u2026 People better remember what I wore if I spend thousands, let alone tens of thousands on a tuxedo. And she is absolutely right to feel a bit intimidated and overshadowed by your wedding if it\u2019s going to be that lavish. Again, not your fault. You picked the date first. But, you should be aware and understanding of that, and I think you were trying to reassure her of that, so NTA for trying, but then calling her stupid is just wrong. I hope you apologize and empathize with her, it sounds like you are friends so you should just be straight up honest and talk it out, and let her know you were in the wrong and understand why she feels the way she does.\n\nFinal thought: It\u2019s wild how much people spend on weddings \ud83e\udd23.", "YTA why call her stupid?

I know this is probably a highly emotional time for both of you, and I realize that you do not need to take care of her feelings, but she was probably feeling very overwhelmed after discovering she might come across as not sufficiently invested.

But you're obscene.", "NAH, but I would not say anyone how much it cost even if they are asking. it\u2019s still kinda bragging.

Her jealousy is her responsibility", "What a fucking obscene amount of money to spend on a wedding\n\nMy entire wedding cost about 5k and we had 10 people, including us. Brilliant day. \n\nWedding culture is so damn ridiculous and stupid. All that money OP is spending could go to a house, renovations, or even donated to worthy homelessness causes or animal welfare groups. To spend that much money on oneself just for a ...memory is obscene, selfish and arrogant", "I think there are two errors here.  1 was your SIL asking about values because what good can ever come from that information?  Especially when she herself is planning a wedding rn, and only going to compare and make judgements, whether we like to admit it or not, people make judgements and find it hard to be purely objective - understandably when she will immediately relate the values and info gained to her own wedding, which is personal.  To then be labelled \u201cstupid\u201d, on an inherently personal subject would have hurt the OP\u2019s SIL who we can imagine is concerned with fitting into her grooms family, living upto his families expectations to make him and in turn them happy.  \nI get what the OP was trying to say, but would be apologising for the choice of word, and acknowledging that the SIL\u2019s going to make OP\u2019s brother a very happy man.  I\u2019d focus on that part.\n\nBecause, Cost does not equal love.\n\nWedding guest numbers and dress numbers purchased for a wedding don\u2019t signal the depth of love between two people marrying.  Marriage is about a commitment between two people.  \nYour SIL will care deeply about joining your family and about your relationship.  Please work together to repair it and acknowledge that the two weddings are reflections of the different people that you are - and that is okay.  \n\nPersonally I wouldn\u2019t have scheduled a wedding so close to another family members, and haven\u2019t done on purpose.  I waited over a year so as not to be compassionate to my then fianc\u00e9s family, and that was my wish.", "YTA. YTA. YTA. YTA. YTA: what a way to ruin the foundation of what could have been a life long sisterhood. There was ZERO need to call her stupid in this scenario. None.

Fast forward a few more years and another cousin had the same thing happen at hers, but with two weddings to compare hers to. It went on for months after each event.\n\nThe only way to escape comparisons is to not invite anyone who knows anything about OP's.

My partner and I don't even know 80 combined and that's will *all* family and distant friends from school I haven't talked to in years. Who are the 30 people the parents of your SIL want to invite?

My parents (not SIL\u2019s) wanted to invite some close relatives (their cousins) because they wanted to pay for the wedding. I\u2019m told that 150+ is considered large but as an Indian that is crazy to me. I\u2019m inviting like 500-600 people. I know half of them at most.", "OMG they\u2019re incredible! Thanks!", "Fair enough but \u201cfree\u201d money generally comes with strings.", "I had to invite more than 200 people I barely know so imo 30 close relatives really isn\u2019t that bad.", "Absolutely my thinking.

Your reception one is my favourite so far. I am a bit partial towards pastels. All are beautiful though.", "Fair enough!

I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a very apparent visible difference in quality between her dresses and OP\u2019s and she just had to know how much it would have cost to get that level of quality.  She doesn\u2019t have a frame of reference to judge the price of these garments.", "That\u2019s a good point and I forgot it somehow in my musings, but I think it doesn\u2019t end up changing anything that much.  Accepting the funds under that condition was still going to scale up her wedding to a level that she wasn\u2019t comfortable with.  But now she may be rethinking that and wondering if her choice will cast her in a bad light. I think it is a big surprise for newcomers to the Indian culture to discover the glory that is an Indian wedding. The scale, the detail, the expense, the sheer number of family members involved\u2026it\u2019s pretty amazing and the SIL really scaled hers way down. I\u2019d be nervous about that myself.
