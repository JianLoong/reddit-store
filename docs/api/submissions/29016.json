Everyone else is though. The time to speak up about a 10 year old putting $20 in the pot was when he put $20 in the pot.", "NTA. Let this be a learning lesson for your cousin to not be so frivolous. Life isn't fair, unfortunately.", "Do his parents want to teach him that if he loses money gambling that they will bail him out?", "NTA. Bets a bet. Good lesson for kid to learn.\n\nAlso, he deserves it for watching TikToks.", "Nta and hopefully learnt a lesson.  If at 10 years he is allowed to bet and has 20 dollars to waste, he's old enough to lose that 20 dollars.", "NTA \u2014 but the family should have stopped him before he made the bet because for a 10 year old $20 is like $1000. Y\u2019all should have given him the change so he can bet $1-2 like everyone else IF you really wanted him to bet in ADULT GAMES.", "You taught him an important lesson. To do that, you had to be the asshole.", "Probably will get down voted but I agree with you.

If you want to teach him the lesson and maintain the relationship, take him out to do something with that money. You win twice this way, with no loss to your relationship. And don\u2019t tell the family. F them for pressuring you. And if they say something about how you did the right thing, say, \u201cI just wanted to spend time with the kid.\u201d\n\nTLDR: who cares if you\u2019re an AH, but the kid could think you are forever. Show him you\u2019re not by spending time with him and letting him know you respect his big bet and that\u2019s why you kept it \u2014 it would have been disrespectful not to treat him like an adult.", "NTA this is what happens when you let a 10 year old surf Tik Tok. You know how many titties and twerking and vaping and all sorts of dumb shit is on tik tok why is he even there to begin with.

Do you really need that 20$ so bad you have to take it from a child ?!", "Did you just say he's 10.\nYes you're the asshole you're blatantly taking advantage of a primary school child. You're his cousin, it's not your job to clench him a lesson, you could have just said, next time you're keeping it", "\u201cEveryone normal puts $1-2 in the pot\u201d \u2026 Do you charge the not-normals more? Or less?", "YTA. He\u2019s 10. Is $20 too much to be kind to a little kid?", "YTA. Not every lesson needs to be taught through bruises.", "ESH for letting a kid put in $20 while everyone else put in $1 - $2. I would at least give him change back?", "ESH\n\nWhat I fail to understand is, why did nobody say anything about the kid putting in $20? It's not like everybody had to call the extra $18 to give the kid a chance to actually win big. So that's a huge failure on all the adults who were there playing this poker game. I would give the kid $18 back if I were in your position.", "You\u2019re the asshole that he needed if that makes sense. While I personally would\u2019ve probably given him a few bucks back, you didn\u2019t which is totally fair. He probably learned a lesson there that when you bet money you can lose it and it will not be given back. I wouldn\u2019t personally ever even put myself in a situation where I might have to take money from a kid or someone I was uncomfortable taking money from but that\u2019s just me personally. You did nothing wrong and in fact probably made him grow up in a small sense lol.", "NTA. He played to win\u2026but lost. Better luck next time, sucka!", "NTA. Someone should teach him about money and that it\u2019s not monopoly money irl. Maybe this event will, maybe it won\u2019t. But you won.", "NTA for taking the money but YTA for explaining gambling a little better and trying to teach him.  I mean what  benefit does he get from putting in $20 or $2.  It goes into a pot so the he gets his money back anyways right?  He is only 10 and clearly didn't know what the hell he was doing lol.", "Dude did you really need that 20$, I would have given it back.", "YTA. You took advantage of a kid.", "Lesson learned\u2026 don\u2019t write a cheque your @$$ can\u2019t cash. NTA", "Honestly, it will probably build character. At ten you understand a lot more than adults give you credit for (at least I remember that).", "Everyone else wants you to give money to the kid because they didn't win.\n\nWe all know they'd picket it all as well if they won. It's just losers mentality conpared to winners mentality. The loser  has nothing to lose now, but has some moral highground to gain.", "NTA, the kid made a bet and nobody stopped him. Fairs fair", "I don\u2019t really get why no one told him there was no benefit in putting $20 in the pot. No one is obliged to match or cover his bet, so in reality it makes sense to access an opportunity to gamble for the lowest buy-in.", "Yeah...Sounds like it's time to make a new rule, no bets over $X small change amount of dollars.", "Yep, exactly.", "You underestimate the ruthlessness of people here. Op is NTA.", "No, it was like a prize pot", "why that makes everyone involved an ass hole then", "He isn't the parent. You're responding to the wrong party.", "OP doesn't need the money.... nor the lesson that gambling involves risk for little reward.   The kid obviously doesn't need the money and did need the lesson.  NTA OP.", "Why didn't the kids parents stop him ? Why is it on op?", "one, it was not taken from a child, he put it into the pot. this is a safe environment to fuck around and find out because stakes where not high. ten is old enough to learn how to manage money.", "why tho this is perfect also just because it's not someone job to teach them a lesson that very important dosent mean they can't do it. also, how is he taking advantage? may I ask? Everyone was putting in 1-2 dollars, so there was no pressure to do a lot. This would just let the kid learn how to spend more money. if you spoil someone, they will grow to expect that, also with a luck based game that uses gambling next time could be anything from 1 day to 1000000 days. I don't like this  next time. ideals like this are the perfect time to teach the kid the dangers of gambling and how to spend money wisely.", "it's doing him a disservice later in life to cater to him. he will remember this moment when making bets as an adult.", "In my experience it sure helps.", "So the 10-year-old put a $20 in and would get the same reward as if he put in $1?  ESH for not breaking his $20.", "Does not matter if he\u2019s not the parent. Letting a child put  10 times the amount in the pot than anyone else is, is taking advantage of the child. Each and every one of the adults there should have said something.", "He's taking advantage because the kid is literally a 10 year old child. Even the group letting a child bet 10x the amount as everyone else is taking advantage. If you want to teach someone about gambling, you don't do i5 in such a yuck disingenuous way. Not making a literal child be liable for a clearly stupid bet is not spoiling them, what a ridiculous notion. \nCan't believe so many of you are ok with taking $20 off a 10 year old and saying, \"that will teach them\". \nThey're 10. That's 4th-5th grade roughly, how could you feel remorseless taking $20 off a 5th grader and feel like you taught them a lesson. Pretty pathetic", "He\u2019s 10. You\u2019re also an AH.", "It does matter if he isn't the parent. Isn't the parents job to... parent? Also, it will be a lesson about money he never forgets. My mom was way too soft on me because I was her girl. If it weren't for my older brothers, I would have no sense of reality and how the world works.", "It's not this kid's 25 yr old cousin's problem. Why aren't you blaming the parents?", "no, we are people who want the next generation to be prepared and knowable.", "better to learn at 10 than at 30 when there are real stakes", "Gotta learn sometime. You're an AH for coddling.", "yes this"]}
