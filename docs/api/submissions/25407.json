I'm now starting to wonder if I should let it go or if still being upset and hurt about it is okay.\n\nA bit of backstory. Around three years ago my best friend at the time decided to out me to my mom and stepdad. Ever since then I've never really had the opportunity to tell anyone that I'm gay on my mom's side without being pushed out of the closet. So when it came down to me telling my dad, I didn't want to do it until I knew I was emotionally ready to.  I expressed this to my mom many many times over the years and trusted her a lot with this secret. She knew I trusted her and she promised not to say anything without my permission. We even regularly talked about fun ways to come out to my dad over the years after that initial conversation. \n\nEarlier in the year while I was having one of those awkward dating advice talks with my dad when I got the feeling he was hinting at me being gay. At the time I was going through a rough breakup and was having a hard time hiding the fact I was upset. So I thought it was either really strange or just a big coincidence \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. My parents also will email each other when they realize something is upsetting me or my brothers, just to give a heads-up to the other. I thought that maybe my mom had slipped up a little in an email and that's why he was saying these things out of nowhere. After a few days of thinking about it, I asked my mom if she had accidentally slipped and said something to my dad. She straight up told me that he'd known all these years and she had just been lying to me the whole time. \nMy mom is someone who is very against lying and makes it very clear to everyone. So when she told me this I was surprised. I immediately got upset and asked why she did it. She told me it was because she wanted to help with my mental health. Then the words that really broke me came. \u201cI've wanted to tell you for ages, but honestly I don\u2019t regret what I did and I\u2019ll never apologize for it\u201d. Later my stepdad came and told me that he also agreed with everything that she did and that I needed to realize that they did the right thing. \n\nI think I gave my mom the silent treatment for about a week before she decided to say something. This time she called a family meeting and bawled about how she was the victim in front of everyone. How I was being awful to her and needed to realize that she was doing what was best for me. She went on and on about how she did apologize to me and that I was spreading lies and being dramatic. I said nothing during this conversation (or tantrum ig?). Few days later my ex even texted me about how my mom was ranting to her about the whole and how she \u201capologized\u201d and was throwing a fit.\n\nSo, AITA for throwing a fit after my mom outed me and lied about it for almost three years?", "created_utc": 1692876906, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15zzfja/aita_for_throwing_a_fit_after_my_mom_outed_me_and/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My friend, you have never had the chance to come out on your own terms, and for that I am profoundly sorry. It\u2019s such a huge, personal thing in so many ways and having that taken from you can be such a violation of your trust and boundaries. Your best friend broke your trust, and now your mother. You have every right to pitch a fit and be furious with all of them. Why didn\u2019t your dad tell you he knew?? He ought to have told you up front that your mother outed you. None of them are blameless here. \n\nNo one should be forced to come out, no matter the reason. Everyone deserves to do so on their own terms, and that was taken from you. I\u2019m really sorry.", "NTA. People should never be outed without their permission. Your mom doesn't get to decide whether it was the right thing to do (and in fact it was the wrong thing to do) and your stepdad doesn't get to force you to treat it as though it was.\n\nAnd of course she's a crybully and pretended she was the victim in all of this.\n\n>\u201cI've wanted to tell you for ages, but honestly I don\u2019t regret what I did and I\u2019ll never apologize for it\u201d\n\n>She went on and on about how she did apologize to me\n\nToo bad you didn't record the first one and play it back at the second.\n\nI wouldn't tell your mom any more secrets if I were you.", "NTA, not even a little bit. I am so sorry that your family and best friend failed you like this. It doesn't even sound like you \"threw a fit\", it sounds like your mum did and is still throwing one, though. Please look after yourself. It sounds like your dad's might be slightly more restful, even if he is also complicit in your current situation. Can you stay there for a little while? And maybe talk to him about why him not telling you is not okay", "NTA. Your mom broke your trust in the worst way. She broke your trust and said to your face she is not sorry, and does not regret what she did. She does not understand the magnitude of her betrayal, and judging by her temper tantrum painting herself as the victim, she will not be bothered to try.   \nYou deserve so much better than what she's given you.", "NTA- not her secret to tell and definitel took away your voice and your choice in how you present it to your loved ones! Equivalent to a woman being pregnant and someone else outing the sex of her baby before her gender reveal party but so so much worse. Using that example as a way of just how wrong it is because it was your news to share when you felt comfortable with it and how you wanted to do it. Then she wants to shift blame and play victim? Your mom is a hypocrite who has absolutely NO business telling yours. \nYour mom is \u201cagainst lying\u201d yet she did so for three years. You have every right to feel the way you do! \nSending positivity your way! Don\u2019t apologize to her. She needs to apologize to you, all of the people she told your secret to and she needs to take accountability and learn from it! NTA", "NTA.\n\nI'm not an expert, but your mom sounds narcissistic in your story. She did something wrong, doesn't believe she's wrong, and said it was best as if she was being your hero, once you showed you were upset she avoided accountability, and made herself the victim in front of everyone else. That hero/victim complexity is narcissism."]}
