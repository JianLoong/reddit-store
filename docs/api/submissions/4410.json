Nope, your apartment your rules. If you still want a relationship with him though, I suggest you meet at his house and explain your boundaries, and if he wants to visit he is welcome, but forbidden to clean, change heating or anything like that. If he can't accept, just meet at another place in case you still want to see him.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nHe sounds like he has difficulty connecting with people and showing care, so he barges in and tries to domineer.

Good for you for making a clear stand.", "Nta", "NTA. You didn't ask for his help, which has been NONE at all. You finally told him about the boundary-stomping you were unable to tell him before.", "NTA you should make boundaries clear.", "NTA. Good for you. Don't contact him until he contacts you and never let him in your home again. This was a power play. Very \"you think you escaped me?\" thing.", "NTA. You haven\u2019t negotiated your adult relationship yet it sounds like. He wants to be involved but doesn\u2019t know how. You don\u2019t hate him but who wants to put up with that kind of interference, no one does.  He\u2019ll get used to your being an adult. It\u2019s hard for us Olds sometimes!", "NTA- I would simply tell them. Help? He offered me no help. What he did was barge in and invade my space and privacy, go through my things, make adjustments to my environment all against my expressed wishes and objections. There is nothing helpful in that. It's insulting and a pain in my ass.  It's literally the reason I moved out. What he needs to do is respect me and my autonomy. I'd very much argue that I take far better care of myself and my place than he does of his, so he has NOTHING to say to me about any of that.", "NTA.", "NTA. I really think this is more about control. He feels that he can\u2019t control you anymore, so he comes over and attempts to take over. You did an excellent job of taking up for yourself and stated your boundaries!  He may be unconsciously doing this, but that is exerting control disguised as caring.", "No. Why would you do anything else?", "There's a thing. I didn't add it in the story, but it's relevant to your comment: when I was moving, he asked if he can visit me sometime. I said sure, but told him he has to be mindful that it's my space and I don't appreciate having my stuff touched without permission, unless it's like a glass or something, if he's thirsty he can grab water from the fridge. Now, I feel like I said that to a blank wall or something.", "My dad doesn't speak English, but I don't think I'd even be able to get to him at this point. I've talked with my brothers (one lives at home one on his own) and we think at this point it's a lost cause.", "I admit, I might have some problem with overreacting or just getting overly stressed out when it's not necessary. He's the same tho, so I guess same blood.", "I honestly could've told him before, but I just wanted to have some peace and quiet without him complaining like he is now", "Ok if you have made your boundaries clear before it's even worse. Personally I would than not let him in again. It's sad that it's necessary with family, but sometimes can't be helped.", "Hmmm, I'm sorry he's this way. \n\nAbout the book: I'm pretty sure it's been translated to several languages. I can't know what his mother tongue is, obv, but if it's a European language, chances are its available/exists.

I'm only asking because I have also been accused of overreacting to things my mom would do to me, but if I ever expressed any level of displeasure it was taken as disrespectful.  I was kind of a timid kid so I ended up hiding/bottling a lot of emotions, but sometimes when I was pushed just enough I would practically have a breakdown.  So I would be punished for being \"disrespectul\" but also punished and pushed away for reacting/crying.", "Well it's never too late to stand up for yourself.", "I did overreact to be honest, but after years of having my room's door swung open without knocking and stuff looked through when I'm not home (I had a camera hidden and recorded him) I react really badly to having my stuff moved and touched."]}
