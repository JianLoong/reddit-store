I would need a real heartfelt apology before even considering interacting again.", "*<shutting the door in her face made me a passive aggressive asshole.>*\n\nNo, using your deceased daughter's name Rosie **without** having discussed it with you nor your husband, and simultaneously calling the name juvenile, is what makes HER a passive aggressive asshole.\n\nShutting the door in her face when she just shows up **without** notice is about self protection and boundaries.\n\nNTA", "NTA - nobody owns a name, but there are unspoken rules of morality that would exclude using the name of a baby that died tragically.  I would be reminded every day of the child that I lost as I imagine will be your cruel reality. \n\nThe time for your sister to discuss her name choice was before giving birth.

I would NEVER speak to her again for this. \n\nIt's beyond the pale.", "Holy shit.  Of course you're NTA.  IMO, this is a no-contact situation, at least until *you* decide you're ready to deal with her.", "NTA, NTA, and NTA Your sister is a jerk, and I would have shut the door in her face, too.", "NTA. Your sister has behaved appallingly. She has thoughtlessly (or maybe consciously) reopened the trauma of your daughter's birth and your subsequent grief. It is unfair that you have had that wound reopened (not that it had ever really healed) and you are now the ones to decide how you manage the grief and the cowbag who inflicted it on you. Just because she stood on your doorstep doesn't mean you had to let her in or even talk to her until you're ready, if at all.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you. Rosie is a beautiful name. This is exactly why I\u2019m willing to cut off my own family. I don\u2019t need this kind of bs in my life from anyone and neither do you. And I\u2019m glad your brother called her a fucking bitch. Someone had to.", "NTA. Shutting the door in her face probably saved her from a tongue lashing she rightly deserves.  What she did was vile. I literally gasped when I read that and I\u2019m at great wolf lodge lol. She would be dead to me.", "NTA, wtf is wrong with your sister?? Glad your brother and husband have your back", "NTA.

That was (IMHO) a small thing to do, in response to the HUGE hurtful blow she purposefully dealt you.", "NTA 100+ percent! Your sister is a huge A H for the name, the post without telling you, AND how she insulted you in it over your deceased child. Your brother rocks! And yeah, keep slamming that door.

Did they tell anyone, such as your parents? if so, what was their reaction?\n\nPS How can she demand you act like an adult after stabbing you in the back?", "NTA. Shutting the door on her was actually actively aggressive - good for you to not fall for her emotional manipulation. Posting on SM about your daughter\u2019s name was passive aggressive. \n\nYour sister\u2019s actions were loathsome, and her defensive accusatory response is only more so. She\u2019s not worth your time until she undergoes an immense journey of character growth.", "NTA, at all.  What your sister did was cold and cruel.

Nobody with any empathy could possibly have done what she did.\n\nI have read many AITA but this is maybe the worst person I have ever heard of.\n\nSomebody who you love and care for, who is meant to care for you, doing that is truly sickening.

I am sorry for your loss and hate for you that you have such a a******* of a sister. This was a targeted attack, she probably thinks you should have gotten over the loss already. I\u2019m glad the backlash was swift. Go NC or very LC because I don\u2019t see a path back from this unless she apologizes and works on being a better person. Congratulations on your son. Pour all the love and time you might  had for your sister into someone more worthwhile. Your niece is going to be weirded out by her mother and father\u2019s actions. Shame on them for doing that to their child.", "You're a passive aggressive ah according to your sister but her announcing the name on social media with a jab at you, isn't? NTA.", "Nope you are not the ahole. How did she think she would get away with being so openly vile to you both?? She is not even apologising is she ? She just wants to justify !

She planned everyone of those words.", "Yikes, NTA\n\nThe fact she did that without even discussing was both selfish and heartless", "You are NTA on any level. I wonder how long your sister has hated or been jealous of you, though. Petty social media insult post aside, she should have stayed far the fuck away from the name Rosie. no one owns a name of course, but using a name that has so much traumatic significance to your sibling is a horrid thing to do. It was horrid before she condescended you guys, her post just makes it 10x worse.", "So much NTA. I cannot see a world where you declining to talk to her makes you the AH. And I truly do not understand how she thinks she can tell you to act like an adult, when none of her actions have been anywhere in the realm of adult (or stable, for that matter). \n\nTake whatever time you need before speaking to her. She chose all of her actions, she does not get to choose your reaction. Tbh, she's lucky all you did was shut the door in her face.", "I'm relieved your family intervened and explained how f-ked up what she did was so you don't have to. Don't push yourself to speak to her before you're ready. If you ever are.

I\u2019d cut that sister out or at least go no contact for a while.", "NTA, what is wrong with her.\n\nMy sister and I both, without knowing it, decided on the same girl name. My sister fell pregnant with a girl first and told me the name choice. I was a bit disappointed but was happy that the name would be used by someone in the family. \n\nMy sister ended up having a stillbirth st about 20 weeks, she used the name we both loved. \n\nEven if I fall pregnant with a girl in the future, I would never dream of using the name, it's my nieces name now.\n\nI'm really sorry for your what your sister did. It would be interesting to know what the rest of your family thinks. Going forward, if your niece is in your life, I'd just call her Mary for short.", "NTA. Your sister sounds psychotic", "NTA\n\nSomething like this would permanently and absolutely end any relationship with my sister.

Your sister was wrong in so many respects. I am so sorry for the loss of your daughter. It is a hole that will never heal.

If you want to you can send her a text explaining how awful and triggering it was not only to use your daughter's name as a nickname, but to criticize you for giving her that as a full name and that you have decided to remove your her from your life. Then ask her to please respect your wishes and do not contact me. Then block her.", "NTA.\n\nShe dissed a name you had chosen for your daughter and then is using the same name as a nickname for her daughter. Its a cruel hypocritical move on your sister's part. Absolutely cruel. She's lucky all she got was a door slam.", "NTA- I haven\u2019t spoken to my sister in almost 10 years. It\u2019s been the best decision  l could have made for myself. Your sister sounds absolutely self absorbed and cruel. You owe her nothing. She deliberately caused you and your husband even more pain over an absolutely heart wrenching loss. Does your relationship with your sister usually enrich your life? Take a step back and really think if you want this person in your life. How would you handle this situation if she was not related?", "NTA\n\nYour sister is a cruel person.

Has she even tried to apologize?", "NTA - Obviously it's hard to be sure 100% that she being condescending towards you - sometimes new parents are so self absorbed that they can't think of anyone beyond their new family. IMO even if it wasn't a dig at you - she can't expect this to not bring up old traumas  and memories of your daughter. I think you are completely justified in your anger and you not wanting to talk to her. I wouldn't even respond to her until you feel ready to - she has hurt you, intentionally or not, and you don't need to explain that hurt to her. You can let your brother or other family do that. \n\nTake care of yourself <3", "To me the sister put a nail in her own coffin when she said:\n\nOP needed to act line an adult and talk to her and that shutting the door in her fave made OP a passice aggressive asshole. \n\nThat would do it for me. Can\u2019t imagine your pain\n\nNot sure how you move forward with family events and such? Probably take the high road? Polite to sister but kept at arms length? Sounds like rest if your family stood up for you, and will support you. \n\nSad for new baby girl. None of this her fault, and you want your son & her to have a good cousin relationship.", "Your brother is wonderful.  \n\nNTA", "I am so sorry for the great loss of your first child.\n\nI am also sorry your sister is a cruel human.\n\nWhen the flying moneys inevitably show up, close the door in their face/block them on your phone/social media.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "My daughter was stillborn (died during labour). If a member of my family used her name for their child, or disrespected her name in any way, I would be done. For me that would be unrecoverable. There is nothing they could do or say that would make me able to be around them. Seeing another child grow up with my daughter's name would be actual torture. \n\nSo NTA. From my POV, why would you open the door? There is nothing for you to discuss - she just ended your relationship in one of the most hurtful ways possible.

Wow, that\u2019s pretty messed up, and I\u2019m sorry that happened to you.", "NTA!!!!\n\nMaybe it's not that you need to act like an adult but that she needs to stop acting like a narcissistic psychopath.", "NTA\n\nYour sister isn't *necessarily* in the wrong for naming her daughter Rosie as she should of course be able to give her daughter any name she wishes.

In a post that also effectively insults the name you chose, and it\u2019d only good enough for a nickname?\n\nTrying to force you into a clearly unwanted interaction by showing up at your door when you wouldn\u2019t respond to texts?\n\nTelling her you had nothing to say to her and closing the door on her face was not passive nor aggressive.\n\nIt was an active choice setting a firm boundary.\n\nWhich is a very adult way to handle someone being shitty. Your sister wanted to make her choices and force people into accepting them by not having actual conversations with people ahead of time - whether it was choosing the name, or showing up at your house.\n\nInsulting you (implying you are being childish) is just a tactic to manipulate you into giving in to her wishes.", "NTA.
