I would need a real heartfelt apology before even considering interacting again.", "*<shutting the door in her face made me a passive aggressive asshole.>*\n\nNo, using your deceased daughter's name Rosie **without** having discussed it with you nor your husband, and simultaneously calling the name juvenile, is what makes HER a passive aggressive asshole.\n\nShutting the door in her face when she just shows up **without** notice is about self protection and boundaries.\n\nNTA", "NTA - nobody owns a name, but there are unspoken rules of morality that would exclude using the name of a baby that died tragically.  I would be reminded every day of the child that I lost as I imagine will be your cruel reality. \n\nThe time for your sister to discuss her name choice was before giving birth.

I would NEVER speak to her again for this. \n\nIt's beyond the pale.", "Holy shit.  Of course you're NTA.  IMO, this is a no-contact situation, at least until *you* decide you're ready to deal with her.", "NTA, NTA, and NTA Your sister is a jerk, and I would have shut the door in her face, too.", "NTA. Your sister has behaved appallingly. She has thoughtlessly (or maybe consciously) reopened the trauma of your daughter's birth and your subsequent grief. It is unfair that you have had that wound reopened (not that it had ever really healed) and you are now the ones to decide how you manage the grief and the cowbag who inflicted it on you. Just because she stood on your doorstep doesn't mean you had to let her in or even talk to her until you're ready, if at all.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you. Rosie is a beautiful name. This is exactly why I\u2019m willing to cut off my own family. I don\u2019t need this kind of bs in my life from anyone and neither do you. And I\u2019m glad your brother called her a fucking bitch. Someone had to.", "NTA. Shutting the door in her face probably saved her from a tongue lashing she rightly deserves.  What she did was vile. I literally gasped when I read that and I\u2019m at great wolf lodge lol. She would be dead to me.", "NTA, wtf is wrong with your sister?? Glad your brother and husband have your back", "NTA.

That was (IMHO) a small thing to do, in response to the HUGE hurtful blow she purposefully dealt you.", "NTA 100+ percent! Your sister is a huge A H for the name, the post without telling you, AND how she insulted you in it over your deceased child. Your brother rocks! And yeah, keep slamming that door.

Did they tell anyone, such as your parents? if so, what was their reaction?\n\nPS How can she demand you act like an adult after stabbing you in the back?", "NTA. Shutting the door on her was actually actively aggressive - good for you to not fall for her emotional manipulation. Posting on SM about your daughter\u2019s name was passive aggressive. \n\nYour sister\u2019s actions were loathsome, and her defensive accusatory response is only more so. She\u2019s not worth your time until she undergoes an immense journey of character growth.", "NTA, at all.  What your sister did was cold and cruel.

Nobody with any empathy could possibly have done what she did.\n\nI have read many AITA but this is maybe the worst person I have ever heard of.\n\nSomebody who you love and care for, who is meant to care for you, doing that is truly sickening.

I am sorry for your loss and hate for you that you have such a a******* of a sister. This was a targeted attack, she probably thinks you should have gotten over the loss already. I\u2019m glad the backlash was swift. Go NC or very LC because I don\u2019t see a path back from this unless she apologizes and works on being a better person. Congratulations on your son. Pour all the love and time you might  had for your sister into someone more worthwhile. Your niece is going to be weirded out by her mother and father\u2019s actions. Shame on them for doing that to their child.", "You're a passive aggressive ah according to your sister but her announcing the name on social media with a jab at you, isn't? NTA.", "Nope you are not the ahole. How did she think she would get away with being so openly vile to you both?? She is not even apologising is she ? She just wants to justify !

She planned everyone of those words.", "Yikes, NTA\n\nThe fact she did that without even discussing was both selfish and heartless", "You are NTA on any level. I wonder how long your sister has hated or been jealous of you, though. Petty social media insult post aside, she should have stayed far the fuck away from the name Rosie. no one owns a name of course, but using a name that has so much traumatic significance to your sibling is a horrid thing to do. It was horrid before she condescended you guys, her post just makes it 10x worse.", "So much NTA. I cannot see a world where you declining to talk to her makes you the AH. And I truly do not understand how she thinks she can tell you to act like an adult, when none of her actions have been anywhere in the realm of adult (or stable, for that matter). \n\nTake whatever time you need before speaking to her. She chose all of her actions, she does not get to choose your reaction. Tbh, she's lucky all you did was shut the door in her face.", "I'm relieved your family intervened and explained how f-ked up what she did was so you don't have to. Don't push yourself to speak to her before you're ready. If you ever are.

I\u2019d cut that sister out or at least go no contact for a while.", "NTA, what is wrong with her.\n\nMy sister and I both, without knowing it, decided on the same girl name. My sister fell pregnant with a girl first and told me the name choice. I was a bit disappointed but was happy that the name would be used by someone in the family. \n\nMy sister ended up having a stillbirth st about 20 weeks, she used the name we both loved. \n\nEven if I fall pregnant with a girl in the future, I would never dream of using the name, it's my nieces name now.\n\nI'm really sorry for your what your sister did. It would be interesting to know what the rest of your family thinks. Going forward, if your niece is in your life, I'd just call her Mary for short.", "NTA. Your sister sounds psychotic", "NTA\n\nSomething like this would permanently and absolutely end any relationship with my sister. This is beyond selfish and weird, and points to a long standing jealousy, that she can finally 'get one over you' (by using the tragic loss of your daughter, WTF??!!)\n\nIf I were you I would never speak to her again.\n\n(I'm sorry for your loss.)", "NTA. Your sister was wrong in so many respects. I am so sorry for the loss of your daughter. It is a hole that will never heal. For some reason, your sister thought that it was appropriate to stir up your trauma. If you want to you can send her a text explaining how awful and triggering it was not only to use your daughter's name as a nickname, but to criticize you for giving her that as a full name and that you have decided to remove your her from your life. Then ask her to please respect your wishes and do not contact me. Then block her.", "NTA.\n\nShe dissed a name you had chosen for your daughter and then is using the same name as a nickname for her daughter. Its a cruel hypocritical move on your sister's part. Absolutely cruel. She's lucky all she got was a door slam.", "NTA- I haven\u2019t spoken to my sister in almost 10 years. It\u2019s been the best decision  l could have made for myself. Your sister sounds absolutely self absorbed and cruel. You owe her nothing. She deliberately caused you and your husband even more pain over an absolutely heart wrenching loss. Does your relationship with your sister usually enrich your life? Take a step back and really think if you want this person in your life. How would you handle this situation if she was not related?", "NTA\n\nYour sister is a cruel person.

Has she even tried to apologize?", "NTA - Obviously it's hard to be sure 100% that she being condescending towards you - sometimes new parents are so self absorbed that they can't think of anyone beyond their new family. IMO even if it wasn't a dig at you - she can't expect this to not bring up old traumas  and memories of your daughter. I think you are completely justified in your anger and you not wanting to talk to her. I wouldn't even respond to her until you feel ready to - she has hurt you, intentionally or not, and you don't need to explain that hurt to her. You can let your brother or other family do that. \n\nTake care of yourself <3", "To me the sister put a nail in her own coffin when she said:\n\nOP needed to act line an adult and talk to her and that shutting the door in her fave made OP a passice aggressive asshole. \n\nThat would do it for me. Can\u2019t imagine your pain\n\nNot sure how you move forward with family events and such? Probably take the high road? Polite to sister but kept at arms length? Sounds like rest if your family stood up for you, and will support you. \n\nSad for new baby girl. None of this her fault, and you want your son & her to have a good cousin relationship.", "Your brother is wonderful.  \n\nNTA", "I am so sorry for the great loss of your first child.\n\nI am also sorry your sister is a cruel human.\n\nWhen the flying moneys inevitably show up, close the door in their face/block them on your phone/social media.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "My daughter was stillborn (died during labour). If a member of my family used her name for their child, or disrespected her name in any way, I would be done. For me that would be unrecoverable. There is nothing they could do or say that would make me able to be around them. Seeing another child grow up with my daughter's name would be actual torture. \n\nSo NTA. From my POV, why would you open the door? There is nothing for you to discuss - she just ended your relationship in one of the most hurtful ways possible.

Wow, that\u2019s pretty messed up, and I\u2019m sorry that happened to you.", "NTA!!!!\n\nMaybe it's not that you need to act like an adult but that she needs to stop acting like a narcissistic psychopath.", "NTA\n\nYour sister isn't *necessarily* in the wrong for naming her daughter Rosie as she should of course be able to give her daughter any name she wishes.

In a post that also effectively insults the name you chose, and it\u2019d only good enough for a nickname?\n\nTrying to force you into a clearly unwanted interaction by showing up at your door when you wouldn\u2019t respond to texts?\n\nTelling her you had nothing to say to her and closing the door on her face was not passive nor aggressive.\n\nIt was an active choice setting a firm boundary.\n\nWhich is a very adult way to handle someone being shitty. Your sister wanted to make her choices and force people into accepting them by not having actual conversations with people ahead of time - whether it was choosing the name, or showing up at your house.\n\nInsulting you (implying you are being childish) is just a tactic to manipulate you into giving in to her wishes.", "NTA.

I know it's not her fault, but you're going to feel anguish every time you see this new Rosie. If I were you, I'd explain to your sister, probably via brother, or in a letter, that you a hurt beyond words, you do not wish to see her or the child until you receive a heartfelt apology and the baby has a new name. She is under no obligation to change the name, but you have no reason to torture yourself by being part of their lives.", "It doesn't even need to be a pattern, this one action is hurtful to a whole group of people. OP and their husband lost their little girl. Their family lost a niece and granddaughter. Sis also did this to her own child, she will always be the second Rosie. She will always be compared to OPs little girl. She will always have someone else's name, not her own. Who does that just to be petty and spiteful?!", "If I were on the jury, I would perform jury nullification.", "This comment thread is what I\u2019ve been looking for. OP is not passive aggressive at all. The sister calling her that is pure projection.", "It\u2019s also super unfair to the daughter, who now has to spend the rest of her life with a name with terrible connotations for her extended family. It will make all of her family relationships a bit uncomfortable at best", "If I were relayed Id call this child Rosemary and bring up dead baby when they ask about it. Buzz kill", "It's also making fun of her sister who is mourning the loss of her child by saying, Rosie is a juvenile name that should never be used to name a child, knowing full well her sister lost her baby and was planning on using the name had the niece lived. That's horrific.", "My mom unintentionally named me something that sounds similar to both my cousin and my half-sister. My dad didn't catch it either. Only became really noticeable when my grandmother said all of our names the same in her heavy German accent. I got a nickname (a lot of nicknames actually) and no one took offense.\n\nI think there's a different connotation with the child being deceased though. And I think it should be discussed, if possible even without that situation. Culture matters generally in situations like this, but in this specific situation, the sister knew what she was doing.", "Catholics used to do that. Lots and lots of Marys. But each would have their own middle name they would go by. I suppose it may still be a common thing in some areas but it's not common in my area anymore.", "Ok, that\u2019s fair, and apologies to you if I caused any offence with my comment, it\u2019s just not something I have come across before", "I agree. Maaaaaybe it\u2019s the name of the fathers beloved some one or other. But that would be a huge stretch.", "I can't bring myself to do that. She didn't give me a heads up and left me to find out in her super passive aggressive post.", "People who actually want to honour a loved ones talk to the parents and ask permission instead of dropping it like a bomb while making digs at Rosie being a full name. There is no reasoning for that, she was out of line and absolutely heartless to do that.", "Suuuure, Jan", "In my state in the US, stillborn babies have had birth and death certificates since the 1840's.", "It's possible to get a birth certificate for a stillborn child in the US, too. It's not automatic,  though.", "It definitely points to, at best, a severe lack of emotional intelligence in your sister.", "So that reaction to your brother says she sees things as all about her. Her bigotry and confusion over *his* sexuality took precedence over *his own lived experience.* That\u2019s a pretty serious problem, and it actually seems very much in line with making your daughter\u2019s name all about her and her opinion on what\u2019s best. \n\nOP, I\u2019d be a little concerned that your brother went through that alone and didn\u2019t mention it. He clearly has empathy and decency your sister lacks - when you have the capacity, perhaps consider reaching out to him to make sure he understands you support him, just like you understood he supported you by his reaction to your sister\u2019s bizarre naming post. If your sister is an outlier in your family (and it sounds like she is), you can all take strength from each others\u2019 support and love.", "Apologies mean nothing these days. This was done on purpose to hurt you. Just move on with your life exclude her and her kid and enjoy your family", "Yeah. \"You were named after auntie's dead baby, and that's why she never wants to see you, because your name makes her cry in sadness.\"", "No offense taken. I admit for many it is unusual and I have seen occasions where family (and even friends) tries to claim a name among the people they are close to. I just don't personally agree with it.", "In Judaism, you are supposed to name a baby ONLY after someone who has passed.\n\nHonestly, you can choose to see yourself as a victim here or see the naming as an opportunity to remember your daughter. There are lots of Rosemaries in the world. Your daughter was not the first and she won't be the last.", "This isn\u2019t on you to do anything. I personally wouldn\u2019t be able to speak to her again. She not only stole but then cruelly mocked your sweet baby girls name. She\u2019s horrible. What is wrong with her? I\u2019m so very sorry for the loss of your baby and for having such an asshole for a sister. Sending you internet hugs. NTA", "You\u2019ve proven yourself not to listen to others. Why should others listen to you?", "My daughter's name was not Rosemary. It was Rosie. I don't think she was the first or last. But never did I expect my sister to do that to me. We do not have that culture. We are not Jewish. It is not customary to do this for us. The choice has hurt me. It has hurt my husband. We are not okay after this. I'll never forget my daughter. I don't need someone named after her to remember her and it wouldn't be such a big issue if she'd handled it differently.", "Oh be quiet.. You think you're making a point but you're just being kind of a dick.", "Did you think you did something here or", "What an extremely callous response?", "Suuuure, Jan"]}
