I read through the whole post in so much shock that I had to read it two more times and I needed to get my husband to read it to see if he read it the same way I did. The post read as being so condescending toward my husband and I. The way she dissed the name Rosie as a full name while also using it, and never even gave me a heads up about it. The post received so much backlash that my sister took it down. Our brother told her she was a fucking bitch and to get rid of the post before my husband or I saw it.\n\nI did not acknowledge any of it was happening. I did not reach out to my sister and did not reply to texts from her. But I did talk to our brother and I told him I had seen the post and so had my husband.

I would need a real heartfelt apology before even considering interacting again.", "*<shutting the door in her face made me a passive aggressive asshole.>*\n\nNo, using your deceased daughter's name Rosie **without** having discussed it with you nor your husband, and simultaneously calling the name juvenile, is what makes HER a passive aggressive asshole.\n\nShutting the door in her face when she just shows up **without** notice is about self protection and boundaries.\n\nNTA", "NTA - nobody owns a name, but there are unspoken rules of morality that would exclude using the name of a baby that died tragically.

IMO, this is a no-contact situation, at least until *you* decide you're ready to deal with her.", "NTA, NTA, and NTA Your sister is a jerk, and I would have shut the door in her face, too.", "NTA. Your sister has behaved appallingly. She has thoughtlessly (or maybe consciously) reopened the trauma of your daughter's birth and your subsequent grief. It is unfair that you have had that wound reopened (not that it had ever really healed) and you are now the ones to decide how you manage the grief and the cowbag who inflicted it on you.

Your sister is a huge A H for the name, the post without telling you, AND how she insulted you in it over your deceased child. Your brother rocks! And yeah, keep slamming that door.

Did they tell anyone, such as your parents? if so, what was their reaction?\n\nPS How can she demand you act like an adult after stabbing you in the back?", "NTA. Shutting the door on her was actually actively aggressive - good for you to not fall for her emotional manipulation.

Nobody with any empathy could possibly have done what she did.\n\nI have read many AITA but this is maybe the worst person I have ever heard of.\n\nSomebody who you love and care for, who is meant to care for you, doing that is truly sickening.

I am sorry for your loss and hate for you that you have such a a******* of a sister. This was a targeted attack, she probably thinks you should have gotten over the loss already. I\u2019m glad the backlash was swift. Go NC or very LC because I don\u2019t see a path back from this unless she apologizes and works on being a better person. Congratulations on your son. Pour all the love and time you might  had for your sister into someone more worthwhile. Your niece is going to be weirded out by her mother and father\u2019s actions.

She planned everyone of those words.", "Yikes, NTA\n\nThe fact she did that without even discussing was both selfish and heartless", "You are NTA on any level. I wonder how long your sister has hated or been jealous of you, though. Petty social media insult post aside, she should have stayed far the fuck away from the name Rosie. no one owns a name of course, but using a name that has so much traumatic significance to your sibling is a horrid thing to do. It was horrid before she condescended you guys, her post just makes it 10x worse.", "So much NTA. I cannot see a world where you declining to talk to her makes you the AH. And I truly do not understand how she thinks she can tell you to act like an adult, when none of her actions have been anywhere in the realm of adult (or stable, for that matter). \n\nTake whatever time you need before speaking to her. She chose all of her actions, she does not get to choose your reaction. Tbh, she's lucky all you did was shut the door in her face.", "I'm relieved your family intervened and explained how f-ked up what she did was so you don't have to.

My sister fell pregnant with a girl first and told me the name choice. I was a bit disappointed but was happy that the name would be used by someone in the family. \n\nMy sister ended up having a stillbirth st about 20 weeks, she used the name we both loved. \n\nEven if I fall pregnant with a girl in the future, I would never dream of using the name, it's my nieces name now.\n\nI'm really sorry for your what your sister did.

Your sister sounds psychotic", "NTA\n\nSomething like this would permanently and absolutely end any relationship with my sister.

Your sister was wrong in so many respects. I am so sorry for the loss of your daughter. It is a hole that will never heal.

Then ask her to please respect your wishes and do not contact me. Then block her.", "NTA.\n\nShe dissed a name you had chosen for your daughter and then is using the same name as a nickname for her daughter. Its a cruel hypocritical move on your sister's part. Absolutely cruel. She's lucky all she got was a door slam.", "NTA- I haven\u2019t spoken to my sister in almost 10 years. It\u2019s been the best decision  l could have made for myself. Your sister sounds absolutely self absorbed and cruel. You owe her nothing. She deliberately caused you and your husband even more pain over an absolutely heart wrenching loss.

IMO even if it wasn't a dig at you - she can't expect this to not bring up old traumas  and memories of your daughter. I think you are completely justified in your anger and you not wanting to talk to her.

You can let your brother or other family do that. \n\nTake care of yourself <3", "To me the sister put a nail in her own coffin when she said:\n\nOP needed to act line an adult and talk to her and that shutting the door in her fave made OP a passice aggressive asshole. \n\nThat would do it for me. Can\u2019t imagine your pain\n\nNot sure how you move forward with family events and such? Probably take the high road? Polite to sister but kept at arms length?

None of this her fault, and you want your son & her to have a good cousin relationship.", "Your brother is wonderful.  \n\nNTA", "I am so sorry for the great loss of your first child.\n\nI am also sorry your sister is a cruel human.\n\nWhen the flying moneys inevitably show up, close the door in their face/block them on your phone/social media.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "My daughter was stillborn (died during labour). If a member of my family used her name for their child, or disrespected her name in any way, I would be done. For me that would be unrecoverable.
