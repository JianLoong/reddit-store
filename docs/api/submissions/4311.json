Hold the line.", "NTA \n\nI'd re-enforce to her that you and her father aren't in a position to replace the item if it gets lost and she should take her DS if she really wants to take something during downtime.", "NTA.\n\nMommy up here, OP. You've seen this before and you KNOW how it ends -- stand firm. Plus it's school policy.\n\nThis sounds more like ADD than ADHD -- maybe get your girl re-evaluated, now that she's older? I got excellent grades (because I didn't manifest the \"H\") and was never diagnosed until adulthood. And wow, I have lost a TON of items over the years -- put it down, get distracted, goodbye item.\n\nMeantime, gather up a sketchbook and some (inexpensive!) art pencils and pens. She can amuse herself for hours with those, right?", "Nta, you even have the school on your side.  As a former band member at her age, 14, I was up to much worse on the trips.  So count your lucky stars she's not up to that and more interested in her plushies and switch still.", "NTA. You offered an alternative, but yeah she\u2019s lost all trust to be responsible for something expensive. Especially something that isn\u2019t really hers. Letting her take it would just enable the carelessness.", "NTA. Considering I had an entire book of CD\u2019s stolen on a school trip by a student from my own school, no one is safe from greedy kid theft or mischief even within a school created safe space for your property.", "NTA - this is the right move", "Your the parent. I don't think your an asshole for being concerned. But i say if she takes it and loses it, that's on her and she will have to learn to live without it. Life lesson here, be responsible or go without.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t let out child take out switch either. Especially if she is known to lose stuff.", "NTA, you let her take her DS. That's a device that she can use to entertain herself, she'll be fine. She doesn't *need* to bring the Switch, and with her history of losing things she should actually be thankful you're letting her bring any devices at all. They're expensive!", "NTA, but I do think your daughter should be evaluated for ADHD. it felt like i was reading about myself as a kid, to be honest.", "NTA - You know you have two options; let her take it and deal with the consequences if lost, or don't and let her be mad at you.  Which in the long run is better?  If I were you, I'd consider telling her she can take it, but make up a 'contract' that says if she loses it, she understands that it will not be replaced (*not as punishment* but due to practicality/finances).  Maybe make a point in it and write something like \"being aware I have lost 17 coats. blah blah blah, I take responsibility to take the switch with me on this trip.  I understand that if I lose it.... blah blah\"   Stretch it out to almost a full page, print it out...  Tell her to take it into her room, read it over carefully and bring it back signed if she decides to take it.  (then do a dance to the gods it 'scares her off' of taking it with her) lol", "NAH. I can understand why she wants to bring it, but you have the foresight to know how it could go, and you're doing what's best. Offering the DS was a good compromise, it's better than nothing!", "NTA but INFO do you usually replace the lost items? Not replacing the pens or having her buy them with her own money will better teach her the value of taking care of her belongings.", "NTA - She's old enough to learn that her past actions have consequences. If she can't keep a coat, how is she going to ensure she keeps the switch. \n\nYou are doing the right thing.", "NAH - I just had to experience my kid leaving his iPad behind in a different state. It is devastating. I also don\u2019t grief her for wanting it and I believe she believes she can handle the responsibility. I\u2019m sure she has plenty of friends to keep her busy, go to the library and get some comics, download some new apps/shows on her phone. She\u2019ll be okay.", "NTA, 10 hours of downtime sounds like a great time to get into character building trouble with her peers. \n\nSaying \"no\" to a 14 year old that has proven repeatedly that they are not responsible is definitely an okay thing to do.", "NTA.  Parenting 101.", "NTA. If she loses it it's gone forever. She can keep it at home and use it then. There are other things to do to be entertained.", "NTA Your her parent not her friend and she needs to accept that you've told her no and consider this the consequences of her actions as she's shown you that she can't take care of her belongings and she's not shown any concern as to the cost of replacing every item that she's lost this year, nor has she shown any responsibility for looking for her lost items so therefore her lack of care and responsibility in looking after her items mean she's lost your trust, you've offered her an alternative to take her DS, so she's got that option and if that were to get lost at least then she's got an idea of how much it would cost to replace that especially seeing as she brought it herself.\n\nAsk her what she'd be selling to buy you a replacement switch and games if she were to take it without your permission and lose it? \n\nTell her that she'd have to replace everything so a new switch, new games instead of second hand if you've brought the games all new, and any accessories that you may have to go with the switch, and there's no ifs, buts or maybes about it. \n\nLet her know that until she can show you some responsibility then as per your rules the switches both yours/hers and her brothers don't leave your home unless your packing them for a family trip.", "I was in the highschool band and went on one of those band trips and one was enough. The only lengthy down time she'll get is the plane ride. The moment they land they'll be whisked away to the first activity and the bags dropped off at the hotel except for like a handbag. Won't get down time until after dinner but then it's bedtime. They'll get woken up early, breakfast, whisked off again for whatever activity the band directors have planned, dinner, bedtime. Repeat until the day they have to fly home which is just as hectic.\n\nI'm glad my mom made me leave my then Gameboy Advance SP. I'm not forgetful but in all the hubub it would've been so easy to lose. And for it to get stolen.\n\nNTA at all. A Switch ain't cheap because it's not just the electronic device but also all the games and whatever else she takes with her for it. In this day and age she has a smartphone which provides waaaay more entertainment than my little brick of a cellphone back then did. It only had snake on it.

You're her parent, just say no! Your position is more than justified by all the details. But it doesn't really even need to be. The switch is yours.

Her brother has ADHD and we thought the same thing, but the testing said she doesn\u2019t have it. Personally I think some people are just really forgetful.  My husband is the same way. \n\nCrazy enough, her ADHD brother has only lost one coat his entire school career (he\u2019s 10 in a few days).  He is actually careful about making sure he\u2019s got all his things, even if it makes him late to the bus, lol.", "I will say she will get over herself pretty quickly.  She will complain to her friends how mean I am, but by tomorrow she will forgive us. And when she inevitably loses something on the trip, she will understand we were right. \n\nWe have also told her a story about her dad having his entire CD collection stolen off a school bus at a track meet.", "We replace coats, because they are necessary, but typically replace with hand-me-downs from cousins or neighbors, instead of with something she chose herself. \n\nWe don\u2019t replace anything lost, normally, but art supplies tend to accumulate over time anyway. We do make her buy things with her own money when possible, especially if it\u2019s something she reallllly \u201cneeds\u201d (ex.: these pencils that are actually erasers, and you sharpen them as needed, for fine detail erasing.

The bus leaves at noon and comes back at midnight. It\u2019s a Solo and Ensemble competition for regionals.

No organization, just piles of clutter: \"If I can't see it, it's dead to me.\" \n\nI was a pleaser and a smart kid, so I figured out ways to compensate, but wasted many opportunities.

When I got on meds I was immediately like oh wow, no, I didn't focus okay. Lmao. It was just my normal so I and my parents didn't realize how off it was. \n\nWomen have very different symptoms than men when it comes to ADHD (and autism, etc). So it might be harder to spot. But losing things is a big symptom. Another is time blindness (being late, or getting caught up in what you're doing to an extreme amount).

I didn\u2019t start showering/teeth brushing without being reminded to do so by a parent until I was like 17.

Thanks!", "Lol so my daughter found this post, and she wants me to \u201cassure you, she is not ADHD, she\u2019s just lazy.\u201d I swear that\u2019s her own words, lol. I am gonna talk to her pediatrician about it though, just to be safe.", "If she doesn't have ADHD but loses things often and cant seem to find things or has trouble keeping track of assignments, due dates, or other executive function skills, do consider getting some additional test done by a psychiatrist.  There are other diagnoses thay have similar symptoms to ADHD but the treatments and help needed is different.", "lol I would never have guessed I had adhd for the first 38 years of my life.  Surprise!  I'm totally adhd, and everything I thought was normal is making so much more sense in hindsight.\n\nShe might be right - I'm just saying keep an open mind."]}
