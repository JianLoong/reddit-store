You want there to be no conflict - you don't have a problem with April and Dale dating.  Your fianc\u00e9 does.  Your problem is with the consequences of his decision.  He's created a situation (in partnership with April, who's also trying to manipulate you with her escalation) in which you're forced to make a hard choice.  So let's analyze each of their choices:\n\nYour partner feels betrayed by Dale.  I'm not sure why, but I don't have to.  He no longer wants Dale to be the best man at his wedding.  That's harsh, but fair enough - it's his event and he should have who he wants there.  Your daughter has escalated this significantly - by saying \"well, if you feel hurt be me and Dale's choice, you were never Dale's friend, and also, your partner can't see her grandchild anymore\".  To me, this seems like a massive and problematic escalation.  Does your daughter have a history of dramatic moves like this?\n\nFor this reason - I think your daughter April is TA here.  Your partner's feelings are valid, and his choice to remove Dale from his wedding party isn't a huge thing (He didn't even uninvite Dale from the event as a whole).  Your daughter's escalation is massive - the sort of thing that would be more appropriate in the face of abuse.  \n\nNTA", "Info: How old is Dale?\n\nLeaning E S H / N T A but that a key piece of info.", " Nta Having someone being my friend as an adult who has watched my child grow up then starts a relationship with them.

Your fiance is drawing a line in the sand and you are on his side of the line. You will lose a daughter over your fiances relationship with another man? Yes its a bit odd due to their ages.

Cool, let it be.  \n\nYour daughter is 25, she is going to make her own decicions about who is good for her and who is not.  If you decide that she is still to young to make those decisions, you absolutely will alienate her. \n\nYou mentioned that you had noticed it previously and didn't say anything.  You only now have an issue because your fiance has an issue.  That is a bit telling to me.  If you were honestly concerned, based on your reply that he is a bit psychotic, you would have said something right away.  You didn't so I call BS on that one.  \n\nYour fiance has been friends with Dale for 7 years, you have lived next to Dale for 10 years.  Dale was good enough for you when you needed him.  He was good enough for you to ride 7 hours from Miami with but not to see if your daughter and him have a real connection?  \n\nYour fiance sounds like he has his feelings hurt because Dale didn't ask him permission to date your daughter.  There is no reason to need to ask permission because, 1. Hes not her father and 2. Shes a grown ass adult with a kid of her own.  \n\nYou and your fiance need to follow YOUR mothers advice and get over it.  If there is an actual issue with Dale, being close to your daughter will allow you to help her see that on her own.

Dale is creepy AF! YTA.", "NTA But how are your comfortable with a man who has known your daughter since she was 15 dating her. I assume he\u2019s a grown man.
