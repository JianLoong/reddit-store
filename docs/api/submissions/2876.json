You want there to be no conflict - you don't have a problem with April and Dale dating.  Your fianc\u00e9 does.  Your problem is with the consequences of his decision.  He's created a situation (in partnership with April, who's also trying to manipulate you with her escalation) in which you're forced to make a hard choice.  So let's analyze each of their choices:\n\nYour partner feels betrayed by Dale.  I'm not sure why, but I don't have to.  He no longer wants Dale to be the best man at his wedding.  That's harsh, but fair enough - it's his event and he should have who he wants there.  Your daughter has escalated this significantly - by saying \"well, if you feel hurt be me and Dale's choice, you were never Dale's friend, and also, your partner can't see her grandchild anymore\".  To me, this seems like a massive and problematic escalation.  Does your daughter have a history of dramatic moves like this?\n\nFor this reason - I think your daughter April is TA here.  Your partner's feelings are valid, and his choice to remove Dale from his wedding party isn't a huge thing (He didn't even uninvite Dale from the event as a whole).  Your daughter's escalation is massive - the sort of thing that would be more appropriate in the face of abuse.  \n\nNTA", "Info: How old is Dale?\n\nLeaning E S H / N T A but that a key piece of info.", " Nta Having someone being my friend as an adult who has watched my child grow up then starts a relationship with them.

If that\u2019s the case than you wouldn\u2019t have had a model for respecting boundaries and agency growing up and likely would have passed some of it on to your daughter.\n\nYou seem like a lovely lady who cares about her family and loves her daughter. I think you can easily fix this through some understanding, communication and love.", "YTA.  Good lord. The daughter is a grown woman. She\u2019s not property or someone else\u2019s belonging. She\u2019s entitled to make her own decisions. I can\u2019t believe in this day this is still going on. YOUR FIANC\u00c9E DOESN\u2019T GET TO CONTROL HER.", "YTA you dont mention what age dale is and your avoiding answering that so that makes me think there not a big age difference plus its not like he was a creep coming after your young daughter who is 25 and can make her own decisions and came onto him. I find it odd tour husband is made cos he kissed the woman he swore to protect but has no problem with her not going to the wedding cutting you off. I think you deliberately leaving alot of detail out on purpose.", "OP has answered some questions but refuses to say how old Dale is. She says she doesn\u2019t approve and that Dale is sometimes psychotic. So definitely NTA for supporting her fianc\u00e9.", "Piggy backing off top comment, but why are people trying to throw Dale under the bus when it was April who made the move? I haven\u2019t dug for any additional comments from OP, but we don\u2019t actually know what Dale it feeling about the situation.", "April is 25, though. This is really just April's business at this point. I bought a house when I was 25. My parents may have feared my choices, but they had no right to make them for me.", "You miss the part where April has a child and is 25 years old?  She's not some inexperienced teenager.\n\nYeah, there's a definite 'ick' factor in the age difference and the fact that he's known the kid for 10 years, but that's all.  It's 'ick'.  The time to protect April was before she began having a sexual life as evidenced by a child and no man in the picture.", "I mean, sure, that's an argument. But Monica dated Richard, and most people were ok with that", "Would it be \u201cwrong\u201d if you dated your 20 yo neighbor? I mean\u2026maybe? It just depends. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong.", ">However, April is 25, a mother, and a full-grown adult woman. Her life, her relationship, her choice. Your fiance is way out of line trying to control this. \n\nDepending on how old Dale is, it's possible he may have groomed April. This is an adult (I'm assuming near OP and her fianc\u00e9's age) that has seen April grow up from a kid. You don't think there's something possibly wrong with that? \n\nMaybe he didn't groom her and it really is love, but there's nothing wrong with being suspicious, especially if they were hiding it from you", "But the fianc\u00e9 is only calling the shots here on who will be his best man. That\u2019s his and only his shot to call", "That was my first thought too.", "9-10 months I bet you a bottle o wine", "25 and has a child. She should know what she wants.", "Spoken like someone who followed the \"When will the Olsen Girl's Turn 18\" website.", "Grooming is possible at any age", "We don't know the age of husband/fianc\u00e9 neither. So both Dale and hubby could be 28 years old guys. \nWe don't have all information.", "Right. Cause the 25yo is clearly her father's property.", "I\u2019m picturing Dale like 50 and bald but I could be totally off.", "Honestly what is wrong with you?", "\"kinda psychotic\"? This doesn't scream red flag?", "Well this took a turn. Now dale has a split personality.", "Fine, but this standing by my man nonsense\u2026\ud83d\ude16 and he talks about her daughter like it was his job to be protective over her. She\u2019s an adult, get over yourself. The take I got from the mom was that she was taking a step back and being resigned. She\u2019s the parent. He can cut him from the wedding, but he\u2019s also judging where he could just be accepting instead of acting like Dale is Woody Allen.", "According to reddit your Uncle is a groomer and your Aunt is his victim.", "How old is Dale?", "The fianc\u00e9e did call him an \"old man\", so I'm assuming that Dale is at least their age if not older.", "having a kid at 16 is not smart is what they\u2019re saying. this is just common sense.", "I think the post shows that she's a bad mother and it's continued to the next generation.", "Yes. Grandma at 41??", "To be fair the post states specifically that April caught feelings and that April was the one to make a move. There is no insight or discussion on how Dale responded or reacted. This could come as just as much a suprise to him as it did to OP and her husband. There is nothing in the post that indicates Dale has ever shown even remote interest in April as anything than a neighbour and friends daughter.", "Possible, but unlikely, regardless of the ages involved here you don\u2019t start dating your best friends family without asking them how they might feel about it. It\u2019s about respecting your friendship enough to realize that it might make them uncomfortable. What happens if they get together then have a messy break up, now fianc\u00e9 has to choose between daughter and friend. The fianc\u00e9 is right to have mixed feelings about this, a best man should respect their friend enough to realize that", "No, he clearly doesn\u2019t see it that way. He said the one person he swore to protect. They technically might be stepdaughters, but he sees her as his daughter. Dale pulled a shitty move by not mentioning it beforehand.", "Well fuck, better call the cops then", "Maybe its just my own bias, actually likely it is, but I'd be livid if my moms boyfriend, especially one whom I've met at 18 yrs old, decided to try to be my dad and start trying to vet who I date. Not my parent. Though I have had similar, where a man my mom dated when I was 16 thought he had any kind of, idk the word but claim to a father figure. It didn't work.... So I am biased heavily.", "Based on what tho?", "Yeah but if they\u2019re dating now it is still a little gross to me. Like I can\u2019t imagine wanting to date a person I\u2019ve known since childhood even if they initiated things when they were an adult.", "Ok.\nAs I read this is: a vulnerable person made a mistake accepting the advances of an adult neighbor, that made the parents of said neighbor mad.\n\nIf it was the son of a friend the new boyfriend,  they will be that angry?\n\nWe don't know anything, we are assuming a lot of info, because OP didn't gave important info.\n\nThe ages of husband and neighbor for starters .", "But that doesn't mean she sees him as a father figure. You don't have the right to dictate who can or can't date.", "have you ever heard in their 20s referred to as an old bastard?", "I might feel differently if the OP's daughter was 18, and the neighbor suddenly showed interest in her as soon as he knew he wouldn't go to jail.  But that isn't what the OP describes at all.  Even if it were, it isn't up to mom's *boyfriend* to deal with it.\n\nThe casual sexism in this thread is crazy-making.", "There's actually no real knowing how heavily involved the guy was prior to OPs husband/fiance coming into the picture.\n\nWhen OPs husband first met this neighbor the daughter will have been 18 and potentially going off to college. That'd mean the whole relationship will have grown between the two men devoid of the daughter being around which can easily mean OPs daughter got to know this guy more after she was already 18+.\n\nAlternatively he could've been a guy who gave rides to school/movies/malls etc. There's not enough information to actually know if he \"watched her grow up\" or not.", "The post says \"and last night I made a move\". We don't even know they are dating, just that the daughter kissed him. We don't know how Dale reacted or if he even actually intends on dating her. She literally just made the move last night.", "No, the adult neighbor made a mistake in fostering a relationship with his best friends family member. Anyone can understand how this relationship puts them in an uncomfortable position, and could have atleast talked to him at some point over the year they were getting close. This isn\u2019t about gender, it\u2019s about respecting your friends feelings in that you dating their family member might make them uncomfortable.", "Yeah but you have a right to cut off a best friend for dating the one person his friend would mind if he was dating and kept him in the dark. However, cutting off the grandma from seeing her grandchild is unreasonable because the grandma is fianc\u00e9 with someone who is in an argument with her boyfriend (or manfriend because ain\u2019t no way this guy is considered a boy if OP refusing to type his age)", "Dirty Old Bastard was one, but that was a self-chosen moniker", "I completely agree.", "He\u2019s known the daughter since she was 15. Strange.", "So to summarize your point: It's ok to dictate the dating lives of those around because you have some archaic notion of being an alpha for a woman who probably doesn't think of you as a father, but it's unreasonable to not want your child around someone who doesn't allow you to make your own decisions. Yeah that's totally reasonable.", "WRONG. Just because you go through, puberty doesn't mean that you are \"pretty much\" physically an adult. Not mentally either. There is *a lot* of physical growth from puberty until 25 years old.", "Bud the genders do not matter, swap them and I\u2019d be saying the older women is being a creep. It has to do with betraying the person who helped you out during probably one of the worst times of his life. His best friend deserved a heads up. Like what was his plan for the wedding? Keep it under wraps till then and surprise!", "Very little if any of that physical growth after age 15 is externally visible, so Dale couldn't have *watched* it happen."]}
