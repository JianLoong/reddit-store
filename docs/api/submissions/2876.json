You want there to be no conflict - you don't have a problem with April and Dale dating.  Your fianc\u00e9 does.  Your problem is with the consequences of his decision.  He's created a situation (in partnership with April, who's also trying to manipulate you with her escalation) in which you're forced to make a hard choice.  So let's analyze each of their choices:\n\nYour partner feels betrayed by Dale.  I'm not sure why, but I don't have to.  He no longer wants Dale to be the best man at his wedding.  That's harsh, but fair enough - it's his event and he should have who he wants there.  Your daughter has escalated this significantly - by saying \"well, if you feel hurt be me and Dale's choice, you were never Dale's friend, and also, your partner can't see her grandchild anymore\".  To me, this seems like a massive and problematic escalation.  Does your daughter have a history of dramatic moves like this?\n\nFor this reason - I think your daughter April is TA here.  Your partner's feelings are valid, and his choice to remove Dale from his wedding party isn't a huge thing (He didn't even uninvite Dale from the event as a whole).  Your daughter's escalation is massive - the sort of thing that would be more appropriate in the face of abuse.  \n\nNTA", "Info: How old is Dale?\n\nLeaning E S H / N T A but that a key piece of info.", " Nta Having someone being my friend as an adult who has watched my child grow up then starts a relationship with them.

Though it does sound like the romantic aspect of their time together only recently started.\n\nKnowing someone since they were 15 to 25 means watching them become an adult.  He didn't babysit this girl, and he's not a parental figure to her.  TBH a 40 year old widower sounds like about the best match your 25 yo daughter, never wed, single mother, could hope to get.

Alternate scenario: Dale is your age. It no longer matters when they started dating, your husband sees a person his age trying to date his (step)daughter and is understandably upset by this. You should stop being so dismissive of his feelings, and wonder why you aren't feeling the same.
