You want there to be no conflict - you don't have a problem with April and Dale dating.  Your fianc\u00e9 does.  Your problem is with the consequences of his decision.  He's created a situation (in partnership with April, who's also trying to manipulate you with her escalation) in which you're forced to make a hard choice.  So let's analyze each of their choices:\n\nYour partner feels betrayed by Dale.  I'm not sure why, but I don't have to.  He no longer wants Dale to be the best man at his wedding.  That's harsh, but fair enough - it's his event and he should have who he wants there.  Your daughter has escalated this significantly - by saying \"well, if you feel hurt be me and Dale's choice, you were never Dale's friend, and also, your partner can't see her grandchild anymore\".  To me, this seems like a massive and problematic escalation.  Does your daughter have a history of dramatic moves like this?\n\nFor this reason - I think your daughter April is TA here.  Your partner's feelings are valid, and his choice to remove Dale from his wedding party isn't a huge thing (He didn't even uninvite Dale from the event as a whole).  Your daughter's escalation is massive - the sort of thing that would be more appropriate in the face of abuse.  \n\nNTA", "Info: How old is Dale?\n\nLeaning E S H / N T A but that a key piece of info.", " Nta Having someone being my friend as an adult who has watched my child grow up then starts a relationship with them.
