So when she asked me to grab her a drink I set it down a little forcefully next to her, and I'll be honest I was grumpy so I folded my arms and gave her a little bit of a silent treatment.

You are really out here in these comments insisting the reason you're mad is because she committed to doing something she didn't care to do and she shouldn't have. You literally admit at the start of your post that she didn't want to do it and only agreed to \"keep the peace\". So you strong arm her into doing something she doesn't give a shit about and then have the audacity to get mad when.. SURPRISE! She doesn't give a shit. And to her credit she said she's been trying more but obviously it's easy to forget about shit that doesn't matter to you. Stop being a baby and just do it yourself if it bothers you that much.

It's more important to me, so I just do it. It's a small thing and if I come across it or if it bugs me I can see a light o. And unused, I turn it off. If I truly don't feel like doing it, I ask my husband if he'll turn the light out in the moment I see it on unnecessarily. I'm not a dick about it, I just ask if he minds.

If this were something really important - I understand. But it was not. It was about you being controlling.* \n\nI get where your wife is coming from. She does not give a shit if the light is on or off. Yes it saves a minimal amount of money and is better for the environment. Not as much as being vegan does, or not using motorised transport does. I assume you are vegan? I assume you only walk and ride a bike?\n\nI get you prefer lights to be off, so just turn the lights off yourself. She does not care. What she does care about is the condescending comments from her partner about the lights when it is evidently clear she just does not give a hoot - like much of society by the way.\n\nI get you care about the lights.

You\u2019re expecting her to care about something to the same extent you do just because you care about it. She shouldn\u2019t have agreed to do it if she so obviously didn\u2019t intend to.

Otherwise you're just being passive aggressive.\n\nAlso: you're married. Why start fights over things that don't matter in the grand scheme of things? Why die on this hill? So the light is on. You'll live. She's already changing her behavior and the only issue is with her tone of voice. This isn't something to be mad at your wife over.

You pointed something out, she acknowledged it. \n\nShe was making a conscience effort to change habits to suit your feelings, about something that clearly isn't a big thing to her, and if you had spoken to her sooner you would have known this. You've essentially been having a one-sided fight with her, next time this kind of small issue comes up try to actually keep open communication, instead of being passive aggressive.

Turning off a kitchen light, during normal hours when at home... sounds like an incredibly tiny ant hill to turn into a fight.

But I still don't do it because he asked me not to. \n\nThe same way he finds annoying that I ask him to give his dirty dishes a rinse as soon as he puts them in the sink, but he does it anyway because it's important to me.\n\nNeither of us resorted to passive agressive comments like OP's wife. NTA.", "This. It's not about just doing it yourself, if your partner asks for help, you do it if it's reasonable. Turning off the light when you're done with a space isn't an unheard thing. Hell, most grew up with that being a rule around the house. \n\nIf she's unwilling to try and work on something so miniscule, imagine the lack of effort about something bigger.", "Thank you. And like i get her heart wasn't into it, its such a tiny thing. But she cared enough at one point to agree to it so responding with such little care was hurtful.", "Genuinly asking here. How should I have handled it differently (other than just directly telling her how I felt right away instead of being passive agressive at first) because I did also just tell her that I was upset because it felt like she didn't care (which was because of her tone). Like I just can't figure out a better way to communicate that.", "That's also not what tone policing is. Tone policing is dismissing someone's message because you don't like the way they spoke. OP is upset because of what the tone *itself* communicates. This is something I've definitely experienced as well.", "Serious question, not snark, I promise: what *is* \u201cthe point\u201d you mention in the response above? If it\u2019s not about cost or life of the bulb, what is it about?", "But OP, if you do this. She gets to pick anything she wants to be your \"light\" jar equivalent to this. Because dont think for a minute there isnt some petty thing you do daily that gets on her nerves.", "Honestly, I'm sure it would help, but she's a full time student who gets one day off a week, and I just started a totally new job in a setting. I am the sole source of income. Not only do I feel overly stretched, I feel that OP has a habit every few months of picking out a flaw and making it her mission to fix it of me. Last month it was shower towel placement. Couple months ago it was occasional small food particles in the sink. It feels like it never ends. I did tell her all this. She also responded that she's actually been holding back how much she wants to nitpick on stuff for awhile and has been holding herself back from a lot more. We are two different kinds of people.", "Lol nope that was other wife.", "I cant find this post. I really want her POV.", "Because you could easily tell she didn't give a shit beforehand. Why else would she agree to do something she doesn't care about? It doesn't benefit her in any way.", "Seriously. This would drive me nuts!", "Proving it's not about the light but about you controlling her behavior after pushing her to agree to something she doesn't want to do.", "She didn't agree,, you forced her to agree. If she had said \"no I won't turn off the light because I don't care?\" would you have accepted it?", "I went to marital counseling with my ex-husband. I explained to her that, for some reason, closing the shower curtain is a trigger for me. I want it closed. I hate when it\u2019s open. I had communicated this to my husband many times, and he had agreed to close it, but he never did. It made me feel like he didn\u2019t care what I was saying or didn\u2019t care about me. So the counselor said to me \u201cso, you\u2019ve asked him to close the curtain?\u201c I assured her yes, many times. And she asked me \u201cyou\u2019ve told him that it\u2019s important To you?\u201d And I said, yes, many times. And she said \u201cand he still not doing it?\u201d I was so relieved that she was understanding what I was saying, and I agreed. So she looked at me and said \u201cif it bothers you, you close it\u201d", "I mean, she clearly communicated that she didn't care about it *before* you told her she had to start turning it off, too. You knew from square one that this isn't something she particularly cared about, so it feels unreasonable to be upset with her for not caring.", "She agreed to it once. The rest of the time she acted like she didn't care.", "YTA. She \"agreed\" only so you would shut the f$#%k up about the stupid light.\n\nYou care so much about the light, you turn it off\n\nFrom the outside it seems like an abusive technique to control her", "No, it's about your controlling ego.    What you want is SO important that you expect her to say \"how high\" when you tell her to jump.\n\nGet over yourself.", ">Its becuase she agreed to it and then blatantly communicated that she didn't care to do it.\n\nAsking her to turn off the light is one thing but getting mad because she doesn't care when she doesn't have to care and she never agreed to care is ridiculous.  You can't make her care just because you do and she clearly doesn't.", "But why worry about a light, then? It's such a non-issue, unless your power bills are through the roof. Save your effort for things that matter", "Yeah she doesn\u2019t care to do it because it\u2019s something YOU want, not her, and she said yes to keep the peace \ud83d\ude44\n\nShe\u2019s made an effort but still occasionally forgets and every time she does you get passive aggressive about it.

By that description you knew she didn't care, and that she felt pressured into agreeing because you'll make things unpleasant for her if she didn't. Probably by being passive aggressive the way you were when she asked you if you were mad?\n\nDoesn't sound like there's any winning for her.", "I don't get why turning off the light is such a big deal. With CFL and LED bulbs, the power use is negligible so it isn't cost. LED and CFL bulbs last a looooong time, so it isn't the need to replace them too frequently. Thus, it sounds to me like personal preference, you don't want to see the light on when no one is in the room, your wife isn't bothered by that. It's just two different takes on a very minor point and I also don't understand why it has to be handled one way\u2014your way. I know you want to frame this as \"she lied,\" but what you write suggests that this is a pattern of yours, or at least the light situation didn't just crop up and you've been dogmatic about it for awhile. So she said the easy thing to get you to shift, to STFU, because it isn't worth fighting about and certainly isn't worth you going all scorched earth. What if she had said \"nope, I won't, I'm fine with the light on?\" Would you have said, \"Oh, ok, I'll turn it off when it bothers me.\" I can't chose a position on this due to the absence of info - is this a new topic that never came up before (and if so, why not)? Are you trying to line up anything else to suit your arbitrary preference?", "YTA you don\u2019t get to dictate and police your partners behaviour. \nIt is what it is. You\u2019re clearly too immature to be in this type of relationship if you get so effected by a non event like this", "then ESH bc that was an asshole response.", "**YTA.**\n\n*According to you*, the issue is your wife's tone. Her tone in response to your passive aggressive nagging over a nitpick. And you are so hurt by your wife's tone, that you slam down a drink and sulk. Hmmm.\n\n*According to your wife*, the issue is you nitpick. You decide what flaw your wife has and you insist she change it. Then when she does, you pick another one. And then another. But you admit that when you ask your wife if there's something you should change she says no. Do you know why? Because she knows the little stuff doesn't matter. Instead, she should reply, \"Don't sweat the small stuff\". \n\nThat's controlling behavior on your part. Fix that and I'm sure the tone will correct itself.", "The battle of the wills.", "Let the fun begin! Lol", "But here is the kicker, I have asked her if there was anything she wanted me to change and she keeps saying there isn't anything.", "That sounds so exhausting.", "I looked for it to link it but couldn\u2019t find :(. Her pov is bs.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16h964x/aita_for_not_apologizing_each_time_i_forget_to/", "Same. I actually turn the lights off in my house, but I have had the superficial nagger before and it just eats away at you.\n\nIf it was leaving air conditioning on all the time I would get the concerns regarding cost/environment. If it was something causing an additional burden on OP, like having to constantly clean up after a messy partner so the house was at visitor standard I would get it too", "Bingo", "This is spot on.", "These are the right words.", "This resonated with me, but not because of any SO.\n\nI feel like people who are triggered/annoyed by this didnt grow up with siblings. Nothing is ever in the place you want it to be when you have siblings.", "I'm the opposite I can't stand to have it closed I need it open.  I know it's better to be closed for drying and not molding. But anyone could be hiding in there.", "That sounds like a bad therapist. The light switch wasn't triggering to me but if I was in a situation where my partner wouldn't help me avoid a trigger, I don't know I'd stay with them. By not helping you in that situation they activly got you triggered every time you saw it opened. But that seems like a separate AITA thread.", "She didn't tell me she agreed just to keep the peace until today when we fought about it.", "If she hadn't agreed to do it in the first place, or responded with \"i thought i could do it more but i just really don't care enough to remember it because other things are more important to me so i wont do it nymore\" would have been totally different. Or if she said \"shucks I'll get it next time\" would have been good to. It was that she acted like she totally didn't care to do a thing she agreed to.", "Ah. Ok. Thank you.", "Well at a minimum, its pretty evident she has an issue with tone policing. \n\nMost of us accept that our partners are not exactly the same as us. They will do things differently. Does this mean we are right and they are wrong. No. It just means we do things differently. Just because we do not agree with the way you do something, doesnt mean we think you need to change it. Thats called being an adult.", "Hmmm. Reverse psychology tactic? You may have to concede this disagreement about the lights situation.

How can the other wife make it WORSE.", "lol, I don't like showers that I can't see out of...so either its glass or the shower curtains staying open.\n\nI get paranoid about someone sneaking up on me while in the shower....cause siblings.", "Good point lol. Maybe if I cleaned my shower more often I wouldn\u2019t have this issue lol.", "Actually, she was right. It was my issue, not his. It was a simple thing for me to go close that curtain. It wasn\u2019t important to him, and I just needed to accept that. With my current husband, there are similar things. He leaves cabinet doors open, for example. Instead of getting stressed about it or picking a fight, I just close them. Life is a lot more peaceful this way.", "Disliking something and getting annoyed at it isn't the same as a trigger, and knowing the difference is very critical to a happy marriage. One is serious, the other isn't.", "But the light is triggering you or your A. Wouldn\u2019t have made the request and B. Wouldn\u2019t be here", "I agree with you. Its better to say 'I don't care about it', even if it leads to an argument, than to agree and then ignore. It can drive the other one crazy. It's like you're not even worth the arguing.

With splitting chores ..etc..I mean are you both contributing to all that kinds cleaning and cooking stuff?", "My gut is telling me you guys are having problems, because random shit like this getting annoyed over is always a tell tale sign of anger in the relationship. Maybe she is getting annoyed at you for something else, and is acting out because she doesn't like being told to constantly turn the light off whenever she does it, maybe you're angry at her.\n\nBut like most people say \"this isn't about the light switch\" lol", "You're welcome! They're playing this psychological \"game\" of who's going to win, who's going to last the longest and we know that if they continue to do it, they'll both lose. So why not make it interesting? lol!

Did it always annoy you and just snapped a little on it? Has she only just started doing it, and it just instantly bothered you? \n\nI just kinda always think we we start really harping on these insignificant things in relationships that something has happened in your day or is going on in your life that is bugging you, and you sometimes can tend to get so annoyed by something that probably doesn't really warrant it?", "Yup. If you're in a relationship with a person who pulls their own weight and supports you, you can and should learn to let the stuff like that go. \n\nIf your partner isn't being a partner, stuff like that really starts to matter because it's reflecting the bigger issues.
