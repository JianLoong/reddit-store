{"id": 29235, "submission_id": "17bieyl", "title": "AITA - for putting my family before MIL after the death of her husband?", "selftext": "MIL's husband passed, he has been in hospice care for about 3 years. This man is not someone either my wife (39F) or I (46M) have many good feelings about. To my wife, he was the (4th) man that her mom was married to. To me he was the ex-felon, racist, chain smoking redneck who has been manipulative and mostly a dick to me since I met my wife (11 years). MIL has missed a large part of her grandchildren's first few years because she was his primary care giver during hospice. We are relieved that he is now finally out of the picture...I am so relieved that this man no longer has the ability to be an influence on my children. However, both of us do very much care for MIL and her wellbeing and she loved this man and so she will need support. She lives 3 hours away in another state.\r  \n\r  \nWe are a family of 4. My wife and I work full time and have a 14mo daughter and 3yo son.\r  \n\r  \nMy wife is wanting to go up there for the whole next week to be there for her mother. I can not go, period. My vacation time is used up. My salary is entirely commission if I am not here selling work then we don't make money, and I bring home the larger portion of our income. My wife has a more traditional salaried job and does have available PTO as well as bereavement time. My job does not give me any of that (don't work in the automotive dealership service world kids).\r  \n\r  \nI have watched our kids by myself before, but not for such a long period of time. My job is Mon-Sat 7:30am-6pm. I would have to get both kids dressed and out the door by 6:45, which I already do (wife leaves at 5:30), also have them picked up by 7pm in the evenings and then make dinners, get them ready for bed and asleep. Throw in the cooking, laundry, and grocery shopping. \r  \n\r  \nMy wife has offered to take the kids with her, but I would rather them not miss a week of their normal routine for this circumstance. MIL is a smoker as well, and there is that.\r  \n\r  \nWe have other family members on my side that might be able to come help me during this week, but none of that has been confirmed yet.\r  \n\r  \nI am of the opinion that MIL knows what it is like to be a mother and what it's like to try to raise a family and work and I feel like it is not the best plan for my wife to put her family on hold for a whole week to go up there and hang out with her mom while she goes through this. Therefore, I suggested that my wife just go up for the weekend. My wife thinks I am being insensitive. MIL has not asked for anything.

Your wife won\u2019t be able to do what she wants to help her mother and your kids will be stuck in a grieving household for a week. Not to mention that no one should have to drive three hours with two toddlers unless they absolutely have to.\n\nYou have one week with a difficult but doable schedule. You will be tired and have no time to yourself but you can get this done.\n\nI can\u2019t help but think of the millions of people who do exactly what you are dreading all the time. That\u2019s perhaps not fair to you, especially since you acknowledge how difficult it will be. \n\nHowever, when you follow that thought with the accusation that your wife is putting your family on hold\u2026by asking to you to support her by running the household for a week\u2026then that\u2019s where I take umbrage. Whether you mean it that way or not, the subtext I\u2019m picking up is that you are above doing this, unlike all the people (mostly women) who are *expected* to do this and judged if they complain.\n\nYour family isn\u2019t being put on hold. You are being asked to step up in an emergency situation by parenting your children. That\u2019s exactly how a family is supposed to work.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be perfect. The house may be a bit messier, the timing may be a bit off, but everyone will be okay. \n\nIf you are truly that horrified at a hard, no good, very busy week, then please remember that horror when it counts. Advocate for better parental and familial leave, support laws and politicians who advocate for better work life balances, and speak up when you here someone judging someone for their parenting.", "YTA\n\nHow did this become all about you?\n\n\u201cPut her family on hold\u201d? What are you talking about?  You & your kids should be able to function without Mom for a week.\n\nEdit", "YTA.\n\nHere is the weak spot in your argument:\n\n>I would rather them not miss a week of their normal routine for this circumstance.\n\nThey are not in school yet.  Their normal routine involves daycare and maybe pre-school for the 3yo.  They won't miss anything of substance.  Your wife has offered to take them with her, so you would have LESS parental duties rather than more.\n\nYou claim to care about your MIL.  She will be glad to see her daughter, but you have no idea how much she will want to see her grandchildren.  You will be doing her an enormous service, and you don't even have to lift a finger to do it.  \"This circumstance\" is exactly when people need family around them.\n\nOn the flip side, do you want to be the reason MIL didn't get to see her grandchildren at this time?  You want to be THAT SIL?\n\nEDIT to add:  If your wife takes the week off she can come home literally any day of the week.  It doesn't have to be 2 days or 8 days.  And that's true whether she takes the kids or not.", "YTA. It's one week. Those kids are 50% yours and looking after them for 7 days on your own is entirely managable. Don't be that daddy that acts like he's the babysitter. Step up!", "Ooooh no! You're going to have a busy, exhausting week.  Boohoo.  Your MIL is grieving, and your wife wants to do what's right and be there for her.  She has the ability to do so because she is married to you, and from everything you've said, you sound like a great dad.  Not the best husband at this moment though.  YTA in this situation.", "YTA. Sounds like your wife is making her mom a priority and you feel threatened by that. All feelings aside about your former FIL this is a woman who raised her own family and dealt with a controlling spouse who she then took care in hospice. \n\nShe deserves to see her family and your wife is trying to work with you to not disrupt the family routine and your creating barriers. MIL is most likely perfectly fine with seeing you all around the holidays or at a time when it\u2019s more conducive to your family schedule but since the loss is fresh, emotional support goes a long way.", "So you wouldn't go to support your parents, siblings, or any close family members if their loved ones passed? It would only make sense that if you are so against your wife going to support her own mother during a loss like that, then you obviously wouldn't do the same for your family. Are you even close to your side because if you aren't, then maybe that is why you can't seem to comprehend the importance of your wife going to support her mother. \n\nWith you having kids, you're going to have to learn how to be way more supportive. Especially emotionally.", "[removed]", "I knew YTA after you said \u2018watched my kids\u2019. You\u2019re their father, not the sitter. Your wife\u2019s mother is grieving, and you don\u2019t want your wife bringing the kids. Time to suck it up buttercup and figure it out yourself, kid.", "YTA, sounds like you are worried about yourself and how this situation impacts you mostly. Suck it up mate her spouse is only going to die once you won't have to suffer through this tough time too often.", "YTA. If you\u2019re unable to care for your own 2 children alone for a week, you\u2019re an unfit father. You don\u2019t want your wife to go because you don\u2019t want to handle your own kids for 1 week, that\u2019s the only reason. You are insensitive and selfish.", "YTA, the mother lost her love, she needs support. the wife is offering to take the kids and do everything to make it convinient to you but you insist she won't. Also- never looked after your kids for extended periods of times? they are your kids, it's something you should do as part of parenting.", "Yes YTA! You are complaining about having to cook them dinner, bath them and put them to bed? You already said that you get them ready in the mornings so it\u2019s just the evenings for a week so your wife can spend time with her mum?? You are extremely selfish", "YTA. Dude, it's a week. One week when your wife's mother is bereaved. You can parent your own kids for a whole week.", "YTA. Sometimes you need to do things you don't want to do, that will make you unhappy, in order to help your family. \"Your family\" in this case is your wife, not your MIL.", "Imo this question wouldn\u2019t even be asked if the husband were going out of town and wife was staying. \n\nSuck it up and take care of them and let your wife go without putting a guilt trip on her. \n\nAsk for some help before she goes with getting clothes and meals planned for the kids and if you want help get some.", "Yta so your complaint is you dont want to solo parent your kids for a whole week, and she offers a solution - taking the kids.  Well, that doesn't work for you either. You also could ask family or straight up hire help, but can't be arsed to do that. \n\nYour wife needs to go for *her*, to be with *her mom*.  Get your head out of your ass and accept one of the scenarios.   We all get that you dont like you MIL and want to punish her for her shitty choice in husbands, but you're only damaging YOUR maruage at this point.", "YTA, your wife may have not had great feelings about her step-dad, but she still cares for her mum who is grieving. Learn to parent your kids, you shouldn't be doing anything that you haven't done before, it's not easy but you can manage while your wife is away, like she would if you had to go.", "YTA. There\u2019s nothing wrong with your wife taking the kids to see her grieving mother for a week. You\u2019re being selfish & just don\u2019t feel like disturbing your own schedule.", "YTA - you ARE being insensitive. It\u2019s not about who your FIL was, it\u2019s about your MIL who lost her husband. Do you have a problem with your MIL? I understand not wanting to disrupt your children\u2019s routine (depending on their age) and not being able to go work wise. But there\u2019s no reason your wife can\u2019t go up for a week and support her mother.", "You're being really selfish.  Get on the phone to your family and ask for help, and let your wife go and support her mom.\n\nYTA", "YTA. \n\n>I have watched our kids by myself before,\n\nYou're their parent. It's not \"watching them\" it's \"parenting.\"\n\n>go up there and hang out with her mom while she goes through this.\n\nSeriously? What do you think they'll do? Spa trips, maybe a boozy brunch? Or do you think they'll be dealing with cleaning out clothes and mementos, as well as funeral arrangements and other end-of-life decisions?", "\u201c\u2026this circumstance\u2026\u201d\n\nYTA.", "YTA. You don\u2019t seem to want to bend on either plan. Let your wife go and take the kids if you don\u2019t want to take care of them for the week.", "YTA.\n\nOh no, you\u2019re going to have to be a parent all by yourself for an entire week while your wife goes to be with her grieving mother?? The horror! /s\n\nListen, my dude, it will be a hard week, no doubt. You work long hours and two toddlers are a handful. But shit happens. Of course your wife wants to go be there for her mom. This isn\u2019t her asking to take an ill timed vacation, this is being there for the woman that raised her. So suck it up and get through it.", "YTA\n\nLet your wife go and be with her mom and get your family to support you.", "Oh no! To be a single dad for a week is SUCH a terrible thing to do!\n\nIf it was the reversed, youd be upset that she would want you to stay too. \n\nYTA", "YTA. Your wife wants to support her mom, help her do it. Let her bring the kids, and if you can go for a day or two that would probably be good. This is about your wife, not the dead guy. Support her.", "YTA. Whether you love or hate these people, this is your wife's mom and she absolutely should be there to help, if that's what she wants. Now is not the time to be selfish or unbendable. Idk if you've never had a loss in your family but I would imagine you wouldn't want your wife to treat you like this. It's not even that you can't make it work, you're just whining about making it work and refusing to figure it out or step up. Your wife won't forget that this is how you're treating her.", "YTA. Are you even a real father if you can\u2019t be responsible for your kids by yourself for a week?", "Yta.", "YTA: she\u2019s offered every alternative: we both go (no). I leave the kids (no). I take the kids (no). You\u2019re being unreasonable at this point. Gotta pick one of those. \n\nI say let her take them, let them bond with grandma, maybe it\u2019ll cheer grandma up a bit to have them around. They\u2019re so young, they\u2019re not missing school or anything. \n\nBut if you want to keep them with you, your arguments are easily solvable.  You can stock up on groceries before she leaves, no need to go to the grocery store. You can make/freeze meals ahead of time; get delivery; etc. which takes care of cooking. Laundry can wait until the weekend. You can survive 5 business days without doing laundry.  It\u2019s stressful, you do work long hours, but it\u2019s manageable. 1 week to help your wife help her mom isn\u2019t a huge ask in the grand scheme of things.", "Shall we back up abit.\n\nYour wife has the availability to have this time off work without it affecting her salary unlike yours and has also said she will take both children with her. Both of which are not in full time school so it shouldn't disrupt them too much. So why the issue?\n\nYour wife is a whole ass human with a mother who has lost her husband. She wants to be with her mother. She is also your children's mother so therefore when and where does she need your permission exactly?\n\nI'm seeing a lot of posts recently of spouses asking if they should \"let\" their other halves do things. Wtf is going on? Just because you marry someone it doesn't suddenly mean you become their keeper. \n\nYou should go back to your wife explain you've been an AH and encourage her to go and see her mum! \n\nYTA by the way!", "YTA. Your wife wants to support her mother, who\u2019s grieving. She offered to take the kids with her, so either let her (they won\u2019t be missing anything if they\u2019re out of daycare for a week), or take care of them yourself. Many single parents work much longer hours than you and take care of more children, so you can take care of your kids alone for a week. You\u2019re far too focused on how you feel and how this affects you and how much you hate your MIL\u2019s late husband, but it\u2019s not about you or him. It\u2019s about your MIL.", "YTA.  How would you feel if you died and one of your wife's relatives couldn't come support her because their spouse said \"He was an asshole, and I'm glad he's dead.  Besides, it's too inconvenient for me to *take care of my own children* while you're gone. She probably doesn't even want your help anyway.\"", "YTA; your feelings about the man who died aside, your wife wants to support her mother in a very vulnerable time of her life and you're making up bad excuses for why she shouldn't.\n\nThe kids can't miss one week of a routine because a relative dies? Really? And is a few days of missed work for you actually going to prevent you from paying bills? You have literally no plan for childcare other than \"my wife will handle it on top of her job\"? Most of these sound like manufactured problems, not valid reasons to try and prevent your wife from supporting her mother.", "You are 100% TA. It\u2019s her mom dude. Pull your head out of your ass.", "Gently, YTA. I understand that you are worried about having to care on your own for the kids for a whole week, but look at it from this side - it is a good way to get the kids used to spending time with dad, developing your own routines. Also your wife is going to be 3 hours away, obviously if something happens she will return quicker. But if everything goes to plan, it will benefit you both to know that you can in fact handle the kids by yourself for that time.", "YTA\n\n> I would rather them not miss a week of their normal routine for this circumstance. \n\nUh....   just say it.  You hate her mother.  You want her to suffer.  \n\nI get insisting on a hotel due to the smoke, but geez not taking the two kids at all with her because you're pouting?", "YTA if you truly care about MIL, she needs your help and support now.   She is family too, and your wife wants to be there for her.  Compromise and let her take the kids, or confirm other family can help, but trying to prevent her from going for your convenience is not good.", "Yeah, YTA. The death of her husband trumps your stress over having the kids for a week. If you were a woman, no one would ever even think about how stressful this would be; you would just take care of the kids and that\u2019s that. It does sound stressful, don\u2019t get me wrong. But her husband just died and that\u2019s worse.", "YTA. Your wife should go but before she leaves, the 2 of you need to spend some time doing food prep so you can take that excuse off your list.", "A gentle YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s one week. Give this time to your wife to help her mom. You\u2019re going to have a long week at home and she\u2019s going to have a tough week helping her grieving mother. Please don\u2019t make your wife navigate that situation solo with two young kids. \n\nWork together before she leaves to get you and the kids organized - have the laundry done ahead of time, get the groceries, and don\u2019t be afraid to stop at McDonald\u2019s on the way home from work. Also, be kind to yourself. Who cares if the house is temporarily a bit messier than normal? \n\nI\u2019m very sympathetic because I also work on commission. Can you make any temporary adjustments to your schedule? For example, how would your income be impacted if you started one hour later next week?", "YTA. Pull up your socks and parent your children for a week. Get a sitter if you can't manage it by yourself, but dude, these are YOUR kids and they are YOUR responsibility. You need to be able to parent solo in case there's an emergency.... oh right, there is one now.", "YTA. My husband also works in the same industry as you so I understand your not wanting to take a week off to go with her, plus I also wouldn\u2019t want my small children in a smokers home for a full week. However, your wife wants and needs to be there for her mother right now and you are more than capable of \u201cwatching your kids\u201d for a week. \n\nYou don\u2019t want to go grocery shopping with kids? Go before she leaves or have things delivered if you run out. Laundry? Start a load before you leave for work and put it in the dryer when you get home.  Don\u2019t want to cook elaborate meals? Put some chicken nuggets in the oven, make something simple, order takeout. \n\nYou\u2019re being super insensitive and adding to your wife\u2019s already stressful situation. Suck it up & be supportive of her.", "YTA unless you change your tune and make it work with the kids at home and her with her mom. I suggest a sitter and family to help as much as possible when you absolutely can\u2019t be home.\n\nOther than that, you\u2019re just gonna have to take this one on the chin and ask that she be ready to give you a break when she comes home cuz you\u2019ll probably need a recovery day.", "YTA. If the roles were reversed, I'm sure your wife could handle the children. Why can't you?", "Funny how you carefully worded the title knowing full well you\u2019re being out of pocket and petty.

YTA, full stop.", "Your wife is going to support her mother.  Your job is to support your wife.  What she needs you to do to support her, is to make this about her, and not about you.  She has offered solutions - pick one.  YTA.", "YTA. Your wife needs to be able to do what she thinks is best and you need to support her.  Depriving your wife of that because you don't want to take care of your kids after work for a week, or because you don't want your kids to fall out of their routine is incredibly selfish of you. Be a team player and make it work. It is not like this is something you have to make a habit of accommodating. Have a heart.", "Sorry, but yes you are!  It's only for one week ....deal with it!!  Your wife needs to be there with her mother to support her. I think you can handle one week while she helps her mother deal with this death.", "YTA - you\u2019re not willing to budge in either direction. Let the kids go with the wife.

Mind you it is one week that you will have to watch the kids alone. As a single parent myself I have a wee bit sympathy for you.\n\nPlan meals ahead of time and even do a bit of meal \"prepping\" ahead of time. Do the grocery shopping ahead of time.

You can buy everything for the week before she leaves, you can have groceries delivered.  You can do all the laundry now.  Heck, you can buy more underwear if you run out.

They are not in school, a week will not make much difference.  He already gets the kids ready and does the drop off, he will just need to do a little more in the evenings. It\u2019s just a week.
