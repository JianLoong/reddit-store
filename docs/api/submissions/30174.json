Afterwards, she said that now because it's \"official\" and he would be living with her all the time, she's finding it hard to adjust. Earlier she was very nice to him and treated him well whenever she saw him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy (42 M) wife (38 F) Sasha and I have been married for a few months now. We have four children together, and three of them are my step-daughters. They are Sarah (16 F), Emily (14 F), and Hannah (15 F). I have Aiden (10 M) through my previous marriage.\n\nSasha has always been indifferent to him. I will make it clear that she does not \"hate\" him and does not make his life difficult in an overt way. She just pretends as if he is not a member of family. I have asked her to warm up to him, but she just shrugs it off. But as there hasn't really been a fight regarding the issue before, I did not want to start one and kept my quiet.\n\nShe was invited, along with us, for her friend's wedding. We went there, and after the wedding she was talking to her friend. Her friend asked her whether \"they\" were her kids (by pointing to the four of them as they were standing some distance away).\n\nShe said \"Yeah, the girls are,\" and mentioned who was who. I was shocked that she had implied that Aiden was not her child, but she gave me a Don't-bring-that-up-now look when I looked at her in disbelief. I told her friend \"You know, she won't admit it but the boy is her son too. Her step-son, and she doesn't like him.\"\n\nShe was mortified as the others realized this, and attempted to laugh it off by saying that she had not noticed Aiden/thought it was another boy, etc. Later, though, she severely accused me of embarrassing her. She said that if she doesn't want to consider Aiden as a son, it's her choice. That resulted in a full-blown argument which makes me think that I might be the asshole.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698948300, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17m9mhl/aita_for_embarrassing_my_wife_by_making_her_admit/", "score": 147, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We have four children together, and three of them are my step-daughters. They are Sarah (16 F), Emily (14 F), and Hannah (15 F). I have Aiden (10 M) through my previous marriage.\n\nSasha has always been indifferent to him. I will make it clear that she does not \"hate\" him and does not make his life difficult in an overt way. She just pretends as if he is not a member of family. I have asked her to warm up to him, but she just shrugs it off. But as there hasn't really been a fight regarding the issue before, I did not want to start one and kept my quiet.\n\nShe was invited, along with us, for her friend's wedding. We went there, and after the wedding she was talking to her friend. Her friend asked her whether \"they\" were her kids (by pointing to the four of them as they were standing some distance away). \n\nShe said \"Yeah, the girls are,\" and mentioned who was who. I was shocked that she had implied that Aiden was not her child, but she gave me a Don't-bring-that-up-now look when I looked at her in disbelief. I told her friend \"You know, she won't admit it but the boy is her son too. Her step-son, and she doesn't like him.\"\n\nShe was mortified as the others realized this, and attempted to laugh it off by saying that she had not noticed Aiden/thought it was another boy, etc. Later, though, she severely accused me of embarrassing her. She said that if she doesn't want to consider Aiden as a son, it's her choice.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
