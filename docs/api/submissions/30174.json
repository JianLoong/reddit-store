Afterwards, she said that now because it's \"official\" and he would be living with her all the time, she's finding it hard to adjust. Earlier she was very nice to him and treated him well whenever she saw him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy (42 M) wife (38 F) Sasha and I have been married for a few months now. We have four children together, and three of them are my step-daughters. They are Sarah (16 F), Emily (14 F), and Hannah (15 F). I have Aiden (10 M) through my previous marriage.\n\nSasha has always been indifferent to him. I will make it clear that she does not \"hate\" him and does not make his life difficult in an overt way. She just pretends as if he is not a member of family. I have asked her to warm up to him, but she just shrugs it off. But as there hasn't really been a fight regarding the issue before, I did not want to start one and kept my quiet.\n\nShe was invited, along with us, for her friend's wedding. We went there, and after the wedding she was talking to her friend. Her friend asked her whether \"they\" were her kids (by pointing to the four of them as they were standing some distance away).\n\nShe said \"Yeah, the girls are,\" and mentioned who was who. I was shocked that she had implied that Aiden was not her child, but she gave me a Don't-bring-that-up-now look when I looked at her in disbelief. I told her friend \"You know, she won't admit it but the boy is her son too. Her step-son, and she doesn't like him.\"\n\nShe was mortified as the others realized this, and attempted to laugh it off by saying that she had not noticed Aiden/thought it was another boy, etc. Later, though, she severely accused me of embarrassing her. She said that if she doesn't want to consider Aiden as a son, it's her choice. That resulted in a full-blown argument which makes me think that I might be the asshole.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698948300, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17m9mhl/aita_for_embarrassing_my_wife_by_making_her_admit/", "score": 5338, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We have four children together, and three of them are my step-daughters. They are Sarah (16 F), Emily (14 F), and Hannah (15 F). I have Aiden (10 M) through my previous marriage.\n\nSasha has always been indifferent to him.

I have asked her to warm up to him, but she just shrugs it off. But as there hasn't really been a fight regarding the issue before, I did not want to start one and kept my quiet.\n\nShe was invited, along with us, for her friend's wedding. We went there, and after the wedding she was talking to her friend. Her friend asked her whether \"they\" were her kids (by pointing to the four of them as they were standing some distance away). \n\nShe said \"Yeah, the girls are,\" and mentioned who was who. I was shocked that she had implied that Aiden was not her child, but she gave me a Don't-bring-that-up-now look when I looked at her in disbelief. I told her friend \"You know, she won't admit it but the boy is her son too. Her step-son, and she doesn't like him.\"\n\nShe was mortified as the others realized this, and attempted to laugh it off by saying that she had not noticed Aiden/thought it was another boy, etc. Later, though, she severely accused me of embarrassing her. She said that if she doesn't want to consider Aiden as a son, it's her choice.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I now have an aging father who has no support network other than his crazy wife, and I couldn't care less.", "That\u2019s such a cowardly reason to not speak up too! Like your dad allowed you to be kicked out of your own home just because he didn\u2019t want to start a fight? Seriously? Someone treating your own child like *that* should make you want to start a fight and get divorced because that\u2019s just so not okay. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you went through that, you didn\u2019t deserve it and your step mom and dad are both terrible.", "My former step mother told my father that I stole money out of her wallet while I was babysitting my half brother. Only after they divorced ( over something different) did she tell him that it was a lie but it was too late, as my father had believed her and it destroyed our relationship for a long time. People would be surprised how cruel some humans are to kids.", "My mother was like this with my dad\u2019s first children (he was a widower). Ask how many of the oldest still talk to their dad? Zero. This is the worst thing I know about my own mother \u2014 and it\u2019s bad. Do the right thing.", "My spouse was the stepson in this situation... I'm a witness to the fact that this does not end well for the parent/child relationships. \n\nCurrently it appears the wife was scheming and calculating to get her and her daughters taken care of (especially in front of upcoming college and/or automobile expenses for the teens). I guarantee she will find reasons why they as a couple should not provide resources for the son when he comes of age. If the husband stays in this arrangement (that's truly all it is to the new wife), then he is an absolute failure as parent. His job is to protect his child from a hostile environment. And right now he is NOT!", "This 100%  wife is clearly an asshole.  But OP is a massive failure as a human being for marrying this woman, who is \"indifferent\" at best to his son.  Guess at least OP and wife are a match in being equally shitty people.......", "Thank you for putting it so succinctly. I have some few choice words for OP as well. I've told this story before but my father had three children by the time he married his third wife and she tried to pull some mess to alienate us from him and the two kids he had with her. And he was NOT having it. He told her to get her head on straight, treat us with fairness and respect, or she was gonna be a twice divorced mom with 4 kids (she had two before she married him). She got the message fairly quickly. THAT'S what a good father does for his children. Not whatever semblance of parenting OP thinks he's doing. Sheesh.", "Damn....you make a good point that I am changing my vote. OP asking the wrong questions.   \n\n\nHe stood up for his kid in THIS situation but it should have never even gotten to this point. The minute he realized how she was treating him should have been the last.", "Thank you for better articulating my thoughts. I ruled ESH but OP is by far the worst because he's the one putting his own son on the backburner for someone who doesn't even acknowledge him as a member of the family. \"She's always been indifferent to him.\" I wouldn't even date someone who seemed indifferent to my son, let alone fuckin marry and merge families with them.", "Yeah, he\u2019s a piece of work. I lost my son when he was 18, and these kinds of stories are majorly triggering for me. Like, goddamnit. A child is a gift. You don\u2019t fuck with that. I\u2019m so pissed at this man! He doesn\u2019t deserve that little boy. And his wife can eat a dick.", "Fr, absolutely pathetic to see OP more concerned about upsetting his wife than allowing his son to live in acceptance. Get a backbone. Your 10yo son is being treated like shit.", "Agreed and happy \ud83c\udf82 day", "\"STOP FAILING YOUR CHILD OP.\" - I just thought it needed to be said louder.", "Doesn't sound like he has one.", "Yeah rather than talk to his wife about it OP deals with it by announcing to his wife, all their friends, in front of the children, that his wife hates his son. Obviously the wife seems like an ass hole, but OP is about on a par as far as I'm concerned.", "My oldest daughter is 10yo, I would never ever let her be treated like that", "I feel like he is probably trying to maintain the bliss of ignorance.\n\nAlso the silent treatment and being ignored can be extremely hurtful, even as an adult let alone for a 10 year old.", "If you enter a kids like at 14 and treat them like your own from then on. That\u2019s raising them imo. He said his kid is 10. She should definitely be the mother raising him", "As a \"step\" mom, I never wanted or tried to replace her mom. She did that on her own, and I am enjoying the grands more than her because of her choices.", "I might need that to cleanse my eyes from all the posts i have read about sh*tty parents pretending they deserved a gold star for doing the barest of minimum \ud83d\ude05", "Typo", "OMFG SAME. my dad's second wife was nice when they were dating but when they got married she bullied me as badly as the girls at school", "I, too, was this child. I'm so sorry you had to go through it \ud83e\udec2", "Ahh I\u2019m sorry you had that experience. Obviously time can be irrelevant, but mostly it at least helps to figure things out you know? And unless someone is seriously playing the long game like your stepmother, people usually show themselves up after some time. Either way, that poor boy is suffering and this dad needs to sort his shit out.", "Exactly! OP open your eyes! This will be you and your son in a few years if you don't leave this woman!", "Not worth fighting over. If he wins the argument, she will resent his son even more. I would change the statement to say some things are worth divorcing over.", "My single mom married a loser who didn\u2019t understand that I (aged 12 at the time) was part of the deal. I didn\u2019t like him, told mom so. Just a few months after the wedding he started his campaign to get rid of me. He really liked taking me somewhere, dropping me off and then not be able to pick me up after, so he suggested I walk home at 10 pm or later. It was usually several miles from home, and through a scary part of town. I always found a ride. My mom never seemed to pay attention to any issues. \n\nHis awful mother was happy to help and actively worked to make me commit suicide. She almost succeeded as I tried to off myself at age 16 after she drunkenly berated me outside my home (she lived across the street as the mama\u2019s boy couldn\u2019t be far from her) and I took and handful of pills. Mom and the loser came home from work, and found me holding my toddler sister (who I cared for more than any of the other adults in our family) and both of us crying. \n\nSo trip to the hospital, throwing up my guts for several hours and she didn\u2019t want to take off work the next day but she wouldn\u2019t let me not go to school because \u201cyou\u2019ll just try it again.\u201d And not a damn thing changed. Therapy was expensive and not something \u201cwe\u201d could afford (and also because the loser was unemployed at the time, again). I really felt she gave up on me and decided to focus her time on my little sister. Needless to say it\u2019s many years later and I talk to her maybe twice a month and only visit 1-2 times a year. \n\nIs that the life you want for your son, OP? If you continue to not be on his side, and cower to your wife\u2019s abhorrent behavior, that\u2019s your future. Maybe your son will try suicide because he feels you don\u2019t love him anymore or that he\u2019s not as important to you as the bitch you married. Maybe he will become violent and hurt others, or himself. \n\nYTA right now, but you can fix it.", "Imagine if he said \"yes, this is my son\"\n\nCharlie brown adult talking\n\n\"Oh those girls? Ya, Didn't see the three of them there, they're hers\"\n\n\nHow well would that go over.", "I am a fairly conflict avoidant person. I solve things peacefully and drama free whenever possible. Drama and conflict give me severe anxiety. But when it comes to my kids, I will get up on stage and burn the whole world down if need be. I can and will take a lot, but you don't mess with my kids. My husband is the same way. He'll shut up and take whatever from people, but you mess with someone he loves, and he's DONE.", "I bet he's afraid of starting an argument because he's afraid of what he'll hear from the wife.", "I will never understand people like that. Why on earth would you marry someone with kids if you\u2019re going to hate them! And why stay married (or get married if they\u2019re true colors show earlier) to someone who hates your kids.", "Doesn\u2019t she want OP to treat her girls as if they are his own too? Or is she one of those that get married and has a talk about how they already have a dad and not to try to step into that role?", "God damn I wish I could hold every child close, and show them they are loved, keep them safe.", "OMG, I'm so sorry you (both) experienced this. It's absolutely heinous.", "We have a relationship now, but it's a bit superficial. We see each other a couple times per year and I'm allowed in his house and around his wife but it's always awkward. There will always be a part of me that's a bit hurt but I wouldn't want to be judged for something I did decades ago so I shouldn't judge him either. We are both completely different people now and everyone makes mistakes. The only reason we have a relationship is because he took full responsibility and has grown a lot as a person and I very much respect that growth.", "It's okay, it was kind of a mutual agreement after a big fight. I inherited that same cowardess and can't even ask my waitress for ketchup or a straw so I can definitely empathize. Doesn't mean it's right, but I can see it from his perspective. He's grown a lot since then so I don't want people thinking he's a shitty person, we just went through a shitty time together and worked through it", "I'm the second family kid too and it was hard to watch.  Even as a kid, I felt bad for him. \n\nI've grown up, had step kids of my own and would never treat them the way my half-sibling was treated.", "Just curious, do you have a relationship with your siblings?", ">Currently it appears the wife was scheming and calculating to get her and her daughters taken care of (especially in front of upcoming college and/or automobile expenses for the teens). I guarantee she will find reasons why they as a couple should not provide resources for the son when he comes of age\n\nAnd THIS is the most likely attitude she holds and the eventual outcome. \n\nShe will isolate and alienate this child pushing the relationship with her daughters and setting them up to be the sole beneficiaries of all the family resources and privileges. While your son will be excluded from everything, and will be labled a drain on *her* family's estate.", "I love your dad.", "His dad lets his wife treat him badly. He does", "The thing is, OP's eyes are open that his wife is treating his son badly, he just doesn't care enough to actually do something about it.\n\n>But as there hasn't really been a fight regarding the issue before, I did not want to start one and kept my quiet.\n\nWhy didn't he want to start a fight? Why would he keep his quiet when his wife is doing this? I don't know if starting the fight when they first got together would have helped, but it definitely should have been started. And if the fight didn't change her behaviour, he never should have married her. \n\nHe's essentially saying his happiness is more important than his son's, and having a wife is more important to him than having a son. She's obviously more the AH, but he's still an AH for marrying and staying with this woman.", "If he's lucky enough for the son to actually show up. If it were me I wouldn't have anything to do with either of them.", "Poor lad. Let's hope his mum is a far better parent than his spineless dad. YTA but not for the reason you care about most aka your wife.", "Like, the fight should have happened when they first got serious and he saw her interacting with his son. He claims she was nice to him before they got married, but he can still push back the moment he sees his wife treat his son like that. How the hell did he let it get to the stage where he's publically telling other people that she doesn't want to admit to having a step-son and that she doesn't like him?", "That\u2019s as it should be. I can\u2019t speak to whether or not you should stand up for yourself in general but you\u2019re right that if there\u2019s any place to stand up for what\u2019s right, it\u2019s for your kids", "I\u2019m the same way. My wife can be in a serious enough situation. The only time I ever saw her get ACTUALLY angry was I\u2019m defense of me. She\u2019s really the best.\n\nI on the other hand, will go full-blown psycho fairly quickly over the people I love.", "That is so sweet! I feel the same and do my best to break the generational curses.", "It\u2019s a convoluted mess. I don\u2019t actually know one of them at all, and the oldest was taken care of by my grandmother, and other two we did grow up together but there is at least a 10 year age gap. The first one left at about 18 after an argument with dad; the second one left for different reasons but that also had to do with the lack of support. We grew up in the same household as the two middle children and did things together, especially my oldest siblings who were much closer in age. But once they left, the broke contact with all of us. And I can\u2019t blame them as both adults failed all of them.", "OP needs to set up a trust account for his son's education etc that is jointly administered by grandparents/aunts/uncles from son's mother's family to ensure that something is set aside for the son now rather than being argued about later.", "I think this person is talking about OP not being a true father to his kid. A father won't stand by seeing his wife ignore his child.  \nIs like this kid don't have a father at all.", "I'm not the kind of person who demands other people love my kid as much as I do but you can damn well bet there are no authority figures allowed in my child's life who don't at least *like* her.  A step-parent would require actual love which most all of us are capable of feeling towards beings we did not birth.", "My uncle is like this. Afraid to lose his wife, more than he is afraid to lose anything else. As a result my aunt believes that any time she is angry and yelling, that it's righteous. I just think he is a chickenshit. Youre wife is screaming at her nephew because he isnt racist enough for the family. And he's trying to see both sides. Ffs....", "I don't think it's that simple. He wouldn't be here asking if he was an AH if he wasn't being gaslighted HARD into thinking this shit was ok. Yes, he objectively needs to kick this woman to the curb, but don't be cruel. I have a strong feeling he is the victim of serious manipulation at best. i would be surpised if not full blown emotional abuse. After all, look at his edit - she literally faked being nice to the son until after the vows. She knows what she's doing is wrong and chooses to do it anyway. People like that will do anything to get their way. \n\nHaving said that, OP you need to remove her from your life ASAP. get a lawyer. you and your son deserve better. You seem to be extremely passive but you're going to have to buckle down and be tough for both of your sake. People with a shred of compassion don't pretend to like a child until they've got a legal leash on the parent. The moment you do something she doesn't like, she's going to bully you and make you apologize, just like she did at the wedding. \n\nGoogle signs of emotional abuse and compare them to your life. You might be surprised.", "Me neither. If he wants to fuck with his father for life after this, or just not love him, he\u2019s more than fully justified. For a grown man to fail his own progeny *this* badly? It\u2019s just unforgivable. It sounds like she needed a place for herself and her girls to stay and this man was a willing patsy. They\u2019ve only been married for months and there\u2019s no mention of how long they dated (but it sounds like it was not long at all). Now her mark is willing to cast his son aside in order to please a woman who truly sounds like she is just plain using him.", "I know, right?  My father\u2019s wife is horrible. Explosive if confronted. Treated us like shit. Abused my sister. I was already out of the house when that started. He looked into divorcing her but learned he\u2019d lose his house so he stuck it out. Over 30 years later he tiptoes around her waiting for the next explosion. He\u2019s broken. I love him but am also angry that he sold us out for a house. Wtf is wrong with parents. Protect your kids, assholes.", "And love can take time, but how does it get to the stage where he's telling people publically that she pretends she doesn't have a step-son and she doesn't like him? I just cannot fathom a parent not putting a stop to this immediately, let alone letting it get to this stage.", "Oh, man. The relatives who get mad and spew both spit and venom if you don\u2019t pass their Racism Purity Tests are the worst. Like, is this why you think we\u2019re born and bother making families? So that we can be sure to pass the torch? That\u2019s more important than having one civilized meal annually? To many weirdos, it absolutely is.", "And like, if you have kids and a house, you should make sure your house is safe when you are getting married so you and your kids aren't in trouble if things go belly up. You have dependents, you need to do your due diligence (about your finances, and the character of the person you marry).", "There's some irony in it too. I don't think I can really be in the same space as them again. A big part of why I worked hard to rid myself of bigotry, and the continuing journey of recognizing my blindspots....I made a conscious choice as a kid to do this thing so that \\*they\\* would be proud of me. And then it just became part of me. Its just the right way to be, so do that, you know? I was honestly shocked when my aunt started screaming at me. I knew I would never really be part of the family after that. But at least I have my principles... :\\\\"]}
