Last went to his house just over a year ago but it was a long time coming. He wasn't really around much when he was married to my mom, wasn't very interested when he divorced her either and would have me in his house and just kind of leave me alone or with a babysitter depending on the age I was. He left me to get into trouble many times because he wouldn't sign stuff from school and didn't have a phone I could call mom from when I was younger. She went to court and they just said that all school stuff should be sent to her after several incidents of me getting into trouble happened and the school even sending home notes and stuff.

One time I was sick and extra demanding and he yelled at me for annoying him.\n\nHe started dating this woman Missy when I was 15 and she had a 2, or maybe 3 year old daughter at the time Leah. My father is now adopting Leah. Apparently she wants me there for her adoption day and wanted a sibling moment because to her she's not just gaining a dad, she's gaining a brother. But I don't want contact with her either. I have been no contact with my dad for a few months now (except for this incident) and I'm not going to show up for her just because he's adopting her. I wasn't interested when I spent part of the time in the same house as her and that hasn't changed for me.\n\nBut my father is going all out to give her what she wants.

I think she's like 5ish now, maybe even six (I never really paid attention to her age) and she remembers me some. She used to follow me around when I was still going to dad's. But I told her I wouldn't be able to go and made things move along. Then he shows up on his own and tells me she wants me there and I owe it to her and how could I say I wouldn't come when she's so excited to have a brother. I told him to go fuck himself and told him to handle his daughter however he wants but she's not my problem.

Go back to NC with your dad and let him deal with the fallout.", "NTA. Your dad had absolutely no right to tell Leah that you would be going, so he's responsible for her disappointment. You have every right to go no-contact after the shitty way he's behaved towards you. He hasn't been a parent. And now he has a new family, he thinks he gets to press a big reset button and the past disappears? No. \n\nI would have told him to go fuck himself too.", "NTA. He made his bed and now he can lie in it. And you never took it out on her, just on him. It's not your fault he's dragging her around to emotionally blackmail you.\n\nMaybe one day you and her can bond over how much of a shitty dad he is.", "NTA \n\n>Then he shows up on his own and tells me she wants me there and I owe it to her\n\nHow do you owe her anything? He's the one who should be making an effort with you. He doesn't seem to realise that his neglect of you has resulted in this and that it must be difficult for you to watch him try to please someone else's child when he never bothered about his own.", "NTA. He basically abandoned you so I wouldn\u2019t call him your father. And since he isn\u2019t your father, how could she be your sister? It\u2019s unfortunate that he is trying to blame you for his parenting, but even if you did exactly what he wanted it wouldn\u2019t turn out well.", "NTA. Your father hurt you bigtime year after year, he completely destroyed your relationship. That shit gives some people PTSD. Now he has an adoptive daughter he gives what he didn\u2019t give you. Maybe. At least it seems, probably on insta. His wife probably thinks he was a great dad for you too, because he has one version. You know who\u2019s.\n\nSo, she\u2019s probably pushing him into connecting more with you because of his lies. I would do as you did. Perhaps also make it very clear that as she grows up you\u2019d tell her how he treated you. Not unlikely they\u2019ll divorce when his wife sees the pattern, so his 5yo might experience the exact same thing as you did later.", "NTA he's getting out of the relationship exactly what he put into it, nothing. And you aren't taking anything out on the kid. You have no relationship or obligation there.", "I really feel sorry for the little girl in all of this, because it sounds like she is may be keen to have a big brother.\n\nNTA for not wanting a relationship with your dad, he is an idiot and I\u2019m sure he will do something to his daughter that will allow her to understand your stand point now. But don\u2019t be in a rush to cut off a possible relationship with your sister (technically for now). She is, like you quite innocent in this.", "NTA Bravo. Sounds like he is an all or nothing, I made mistakes so it\u2019s too late\u2014this one is fresh and new, I\u2019m going all out.", "NTA! Not at all. He wants you to just play \u201chappy family\u201d after he abandoned you? GTFOH.", "NTA\n\nBut my heart kinda breaks for that little girl", "NTA. Though you should tell his new gf/wife exactly what he put you through and that you hope he'll be a better father to leah than he was to you, but you can't pretend to be her brother after everything your that man put you through, because as far as your concerned you aren't his son.", "ESH. I personally would show up. I'd make it clear to your dad that you are showing up only for your little sister, because you don't want to be like the failure he was when he raised you, and to do better this time.\n\nYour deadbeat dad is overly excited at his new family and frankly his 2nd chance to be a better parents. \n\nYou're justifiably not close to your dad. Sure. But he's also not wrong, that you're taking out that out on a child. \n\nAll the your little sister know is that her older brother who she used to follow around is gone.", "Yta, only because u seem whiney.

He values his new wife and by extension her daughter so he needs you to make her happy. I would go NC fully. It doesn't seem like there's any reason to stay in contact with him.", "NTA and I'm sorry you had to go through all that as a kid. He's using his daughter as emotional blackmail, which just solidifies everything you've stated about him.\n\nGo NC and I think therapy may help you unpack everything from the past. None of it is your fault.", "NTA\n\nHe made his choices in life, and you have been dealing with his outcomes. OP, continue to stay NC with your dad. He needs to learn that his actions come with consequences and that he sucks as a father.", ">He said I was an asshole for taking it out on his kid.\n\nWow, wonder where you learnt that from?", ">He told me I was an asshole for taking it out on a kid.\n\nThis shoe is so on his foot... Of course it's not the little girls fault, but it is absolutely your fathers fault. NTA. The role of the A I'd firmly held by your father.", "Oh, she was never under the illusion he was good to me. But he cared about her kid or made an effort so that was all she cared about.", "She is but I also don't think we're exactly siblings because of this. She seems to have a way more involved dad than I ever had. Which is great for her. But there's nothing that ties us together in my eyes for us to be any kind of siblings.", "His wife is aware of how he was with me. She doesn't care since he's good to her kid.", "She's not my little sister though. She's just a kid I spent some time in the same house with. But we're not family. He's not family and without that there is no tie between her and me.", "She's not his sister.", "At least she should realize why you don\u2019t want anything to do with him. And her, and her daughter.", "Hang on, I read your post wrong thinking you shared a dad. Missed out that she is his adoptive daughter. You are right, may be in time you could be friends because there is no guarantee your dad will remain the upbeat dad he is now with her. Either way you don\u2019t owe her or your dad anything.", "Ok, but I do still feel bad for her. She doesn\u2019t understand any of your history. None of this is her fault. But that\u2019s for her parents to handle. \n\nRegardless OP, you\u2019re NTA here. You\u2019re not a fun, new brother for the child. You\u2019re not a prop for social media adoption brother pics. Sorry to be harsh but if they wanted you around for anything other than show, they would have made more of an effort sooner. Really they should have talked to you about the adoption before they got the child\u2019s hopes up that she\u2019d be gaining a brother. Again, it\u2019s on them to handle the fallout from their poor planning. \n\nBesides this mess, are you doing ok? Is your mom supportive?", "NTA\n\nShe did invite you so it would be kind of you could make a cameo appearance, just because she\u2019s a little kid. Or just send her your apologies. \n\nCan\u2019t be mad at you if you don\u2019t go. He\u2019s manipulating it all and you don\u2019t have to play his game.", "You're old enough to understand that. She doesn't. All she knows is someone she lives with for more than half her life is not there.  \nI agree that you don't owe your dad anything and you are technically not her brother.... and yes you don't have to do anything. Are you going to be occasionally seeing her for many more years? If you don't, then cutting the connection now might be best for the girl. If you do, however, I'd try to have an amenable relationship with her.", "I would hope so. She never really bothered saying much to me when I was there. Doubt she really cared enough to. But I would find her even worse if she then thought I owed her daughter a relationship or even her and my father. Hopefully she's not one of those people though.", "It's all good!", "My mom's supportive. She had to shoulder a lot when I was a kid because of how absent my dad was. She always did her best for me and she fought hard for me. There are times she was the only person I felt I could be honest with.\n\nI'm doing better. I think over time I kind of grew cold to it all. To him specifically. It was the only way to make it through honestly. Being away from him has only been good for me.", "I won't be seeing her occasionally. He doesn't have family I know so nothing like that where we might see each other. I also want to go back to no contact with him.", "Stay strong, don\u2019t cave but without being a dick.", "You aren't taking anything out on a kid you will have no relationship with going forward. What could you possibly owe her? It's nice your dad maybe wants to parent now but he already has a kid he didn't bother with. NTA. \n\n>I told him to go fuck himself and told him to handle his daughter however he wants but she's not my problem.\n\nThis is accurate. She's not gaining a brother because your father lost his son through his own actions.", "NTA- If you'd been rude or nasty to Leah, maybe, but you weren't. You just told her you couldn't come. This is your father's problem. Best of luck with NC going forward.", "2 issues here. The first is about your dad and you're right to say screw him. \n\nThe second is whether you like the girl and if you're willing to be her brother in name and humour her especially if it's not a big loss to you. I assume you had interacted with her before and you might even have liked her.  To be clear, however you choose you're NTA as you don't owe her but consider it purely from that perspective and see if you're willing to be there for her.", "NTA.  Call up missy and tell her what a terrible father he was to you.  Give specific examples.  Tell Missy that you are unable to attend because you don\u2019t consider him as dad, and that you have worries about how he may act towards Leah in the future.", "Idk this isn\u2019t reall a your the asshole vs not situation. It\u2019s just a simple fact that you are mad and not dealing with the fact that your dad isn\u2019t there for you but had another child that isn\u2019t even his blood and taking better care of her than he did you. And as a result you are isolating yourself from him and everyone he\u2019s attached to. I say go to therapy and dig deeper into that, so you can eventually forgive and let go of those negative feelings for YOU not for anyone else.", "Your dad is an asshole because he put the little girl (and you) in that situation.", "Did you tell him you learned it from him the way he treated you as a kid?", "NTA. And next time he pushes you ask him how he thinks it makes you feel giving her everything that he was too much of a deadbeat to give you. That you respect the fact he has matured but that you are not siblings because he wasn't able to be the same kind of Dad to you as he is to her. Glad you had your mother. But try to be nice to the little girl as you would a cousin as not her fault. Though sounds like you are being in.", "NTA. You have all the right reasons to decide how to move on in your life and  who you consider family and who not. If she wanted your side of the story and get to know you better, she would have done so way earlier.", "NTA.\n\nAnd \\*you\\* aren't taking anything out on the kid.  You were blunt and straightforward to HIM when he tried to fuck you over YET AGAIN, and he's trying to claim that's an attack on the kid.\n\nTell him that if he doesn't quit it you'll tell the girl ALL the shitty behavior he's committed despite being your BIRTH father, and ask her if she wants to reconsider being adopted by such a shitty man.", "My dumbass thought you were telling him to go to North Carolina.", "I'm not willing to fill that role for her. I very rarely interacted with her and never considered her much of a presence in my life.", "Why would I chase someone who has never shown even a little that he gives a shit about me?", "She is in no way his little sister. If dad wants to pretend, that's on him, but OP owes him and his new family nothing.", "User name is legit", "NTA and you deserve better than this.\n\nYou're also handling it in an extremely mature way.", "Don't listen to this person. \n\nYour dad sounds like my ex husband. You remind me of how he treated our daughter. You have no obligation to pretend he's anything other than exactly what he is. \n\nMy heart breaks that he had so little regard for you. And I wish you everything good in life without this nonsense."]}
