And her, and her daughter.", "Hang on, I read your post wrong thinking you shared a dad. Missed out that she is his adoptive daughter. You are right, may be in time you could be friends because there is no guarantee your dad will remain the upbeat dad he is now with her. Either way you don\u2019t owe her or your dad anything.", "Ok, but I do still feel bad for her. She doesn\u2019t understand any of your history. None of this is her fault. But that\u2019s for her parents to handle. \n\nRegardless OP, you\u2019re NTA here. You\u2019re not a fun, new brother for the child. You\u2019re not a prop for social media adoption brother pics. Sorry to be harsh but if they wanted you around for anything other than show, they would have made more of an effort sooner. Really they should have talked to you about the adoption before they got the child\u2019s hopes up that she\u2019d be gaining a brother. Again, it\u2019s on them to handle the fallout from their poor planning. \n\nBesides this mess, are you doing ok? Is your mom supportive?", "NTA\n\nShe did invite you so it would be kind of you could make a cameo appearance, just because she\u2019s a little kid. Or just send her your apologies. \n\nCan\u2019t be mad at you if you don\u2019t go. He\u2019s manipulating it all and you don\u2019t have to play his game.", "You're old enough to understand that. She doesn't. All she knows is someone she lives with for more than half her life is not there.  \nI agree that you don't owe your dad anything and you are technically not her brother.... and yes you don't have to do anything. Are you going to be occasionally seeing her for many more years? If you don't, then cutting the connection now might be best for the girl. If you do, however, I'd try to have an amenable relationship with her.", "I would hope so. She never really bothered saying much to me when I was there. Doubt she really cared enough to. But I would find her even worse if she then thought I owed her daughter a relationship or even her and my father. Hopefully she's not one of those people though.", "It's all good!", "My mom's supportive. She had to shoulder a lot when I was a kid because of how absent my dad was. She always did her best for me and she fought hard for me. There are times she was the only person I felt I could be honest with.\n\nI'm doing better. I think over time I kind of grew cold to it all. To him specifically. It was the only way to make it through honestly. Being away from him has only been good for me.", "I won't be seeing her occasionally. He doesn't have family I know so nothing like that where we might see each other. I also want to go back to no contact with him.", "Stay strong, don\u2019t cave but without being a dick.", "You aren't taking anything out on a kid you will have no relationship with going forward.

NTA. \n\n>I told him to go fuck himself and told him to handle his daughter however he wants but she's not my problem.\n\nThis is accurate. She's not gaining a brother because your father lost his son through his own actions.", "NTA- If you'd been rude or nasty to Leah, maybe, but you weren't. You just told her you couldn't come. This is your father's problem. Best of luck with NC going forward.", "2 issues here. The first is about your dad and you're right to say screw him. \n\nThe second is whether you like the girl and if you're willing to be her brother in name and humour her especially if it's not a big loss to you. I assume you had interacted with her before and you might even have liked her.  To be clear, however you choose you're NTA as you don't owe her but consider it purely from that perspective and see if you're willing to be there for her.", "NTA.  Call up missy and tell her what a terrible father he was to you.  Give specific examples.  Tell Missy that you are unable to attend because you don\u2019t consider him as dad, and that you have worries about how he may act towards Leah in the future.", "Idk this isn\u2019t reall a your the asshole vs not situation. It\u2019s just a simple fact that you are mad and not dealing with the fact that your dad isn\u2019t there for you but had another child that isn\u2019t even his blood and taking better care of her than he did you. And as a result you are isolating yourself from him and everyone he\u2019s attached to. I say go to therapy and dig deeper into that, so you can eventually forgive and let go of those negative feelings for YOU not for anyone else.", "Your dad is an asshole because he put the little girl (and you) in that situation.", "Did you tell him you learned it from him the way he treated you as a kid?", "NTA. And next time he pushes you ask him how he thinks it makes you feel giving her everything that he was too much of a deadbeat to give you. That you respect the fact he has matured but that you are not siblings because he wasn't able to be the same kind of Dad to you as he is to her. Glad you had your mother. But try to be nice to the little girl as you would a cousin as not her fault. Though sounds like you are being in.", "NTA.

You were blunt and straightforward to HIM when he tried to fuck you over YET AGAIN, and he's trying to claim that's an attack on the kid.\n\nTell him that if he doesn't quit it you'll tell the girl ALL the shitty behavior he's committed despite being your BIRTH father, and ask her if she wants to reconsider being adopted by such a shitty man.", "My dumbass thought you were telling him to go to North Carolina.", "I'm not willing to fill that role for her. I very rarely interacted with her and never considered her much of a presence in my life.", "Why would I chase someone who has never shown even a little that he gives a shit about me?", "She is in no way his little sister. If dad wants to pretend, that's on him, but OP owes him and his new family nothing.", "User name is legit", "NTA and you deserve better than this.\n\nYou're also handling it in an extremely mature way.", "Don't listen to this person. \n\nYour dad sounds like my ex husband. You remind me of how he treated our daughter. You have no obligation to pretend he's anything other than exactly what he is. \n\nMy heart breaks that he had so little regard for you.

Go away, we're done here.\"", "NTA\n\nYou DIDN'T take it out on the kid. You told her you wouldn't be able to make it. You didn't yell at her, and you weren't mean to her. Now your dad has to deal with the fallout of making promises for someone else.", "The conflict between you and your dad is running over on to his daughter. He needs to explain to her, in an age appropriate way, that you are not going to be part of their family. Nta, but please remember that the daughter is innocent in this mess. Full NC might be the best choice", "NTA. My heart goes out to you, your father really hurt you. I would continue having no contact with him but may I also say- and this is really hard to do- don't let your dad's conduct harden your heart towards others as you move forward in your own life. I do I think its really sweet how excited his soon to be adopted daughter is too see you- too bad your father is such an a\u00d7#hole that he expects you to be a \"brother\" when he can't acknowledge or make amends me for his own son.

She'll remember that you were there for the rest of her life. You've no obligation of course, and I myself am NC with my own father the last 8 years and my mother for the last 11mos. I get it. It also means that I am NC with my younger brother because he's mentally disabled and unable to communicate with me without my parents' involvement. It's sad but it's the way it has to be. That might be how it is for you and the wee girl and you wouldn't be the asshole! But. You have choices, is all I'm saying. 18 is young, it's hard to make these emotional choices and I wish you the very best no matter what.
