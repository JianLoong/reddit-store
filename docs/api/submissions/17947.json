They're now four months old.\n\nMy niece is adopted after several years of my SIL and brother waiting and I am truly happy for them. My son was not as planned (ha) and I think their true want and preparation makes them absolutely amazing parents. \n\nBut my SIL and I have kinda butted heads. We're different in our parenting philosophies, but I try to put it on the back-burner, because ultimately they're babies (I do have a toddler, but he's very young) and either of us could change. \n\nAnyway, the issue at hand. I was talking to my sister about baby troubles last week. I suffer from severe post partum anxiety and have recently got back on meds. \n\nMy SIL added in that newborns can be difficult, I agreed, moved on with my sistef. She continued to talk about difficult newborn milestones, and eventually, my sister brought up her nerve damage from her c-sec. I also have nerve damage from my first, and we then got onto the struggles of newborns while recovering.\n\nMy SIL was getting a little impatient and annoyed, talking about how she struggled too. I told her than we all struggled, but \"theres no struggle like changing a diaper with split stitches\" (paraphrasing). Also mentioned sore boobs and mastitis.\n\nShe, essentially, told me that there was \"no real comparison\" and she didn't struggle less than me because she didn't recover from birth. I said it absolutely made a difference and I, without a doubt, struggled more than her. \n\nShe got upset then and I ended up telling her she didn't understand the true hell of the newborn stage. I know it was an asshole thing to say and definitely hurt her more than I intended.\n\nShe left and has removed both my sister and I on all platforms. \n\nMy brother eventually told us, after a few days, that she was just trying to be a part of our \"clique\" and she feels like she doesn't fit in with us because they adopted. \n\nI fully get that but she should just say that rather than trying to add in her thoughts where they aren't needed. She doesn't understand post partum recovery and thats fine.\n\nI did shoot her a text to apologise but she is still really hurt. Was I really that much of an asshole? I know I was, at least a bit, but I don't think its ignore for a week levels.\n\nI guess this is less \"Am I the asshole?\" and more \"Am I the only asshole?\" Hah.\n\nETA; Ages. Apparently they're important.

That\u2019s pain too. You seem to be so intent on dismissing her experience of being \u201cnot as bad\u201d because it\u2019s not your experience.

They said it barely added to the healing time, remember I had both so that added time either way and difficulties. I take meds and chemo for serious issues including leukemia and it was levaquin that caused the rupture in the first place (an antibiotic your husband now needs to avoid if they didn't tell you as it can easily cause reruptures). However all my issues and the bedrest weakened my back so 5 of my vertebrae literally broke. Which is why I'm learning to move again. That brace just came off part time yesterday actually after almost 4 months of full time. Couldn't even pull my pants up using the bathroom for at least a month and am still using a walker most of the time. Just saying it can be as rough as labor sometimes. And OP is being extremely judgmental and gatekeeping over everything. I hope your husband is doing well and it is nice to hear of someone else they opted against surgery with. My orthopedist team said they now intend to do surgery on probably only half the patients they were after my progress, especially since it means if I have issues in future surgery will be an option we have a better chance with.

You didn't need to be cruel but she also didn't need to push so hard. I understand she wanted to be included and she is just as much of a mother through adoption, but at the same time you really can't compare birth and delivery to adoption.  My first was very traumatic, 48 hour labor that ended in emergency c section. My daughter was born with a neck injury and needed tongue tie revision very early, I also had trouble breastfeeding and bad post partum depression.  It was A LOT. \n\nOn top of all that when my daughter was one week old we had strangers (long story short, friends of friends from where we used to live) come stay with us because they were adopting a baby in our city. They stayed in our guest room and we lent them baby stuff and even our car. They literally went to the hospital and picked up a baby and that was that. I could tell the wife judged me really hard because I didn't have energy to be a good \"host\" and entertain them every evening. It was wild to me. She would make comments about how easy their baby was, meanwhile I could barely walk and was dealing with a whole bunch of trauma. There was no compassion. But I also didn't chastise her, she just truly didn't understand because her experience was vastly different than mine.", "INFO: OP, did you get pregnant both times by a way that would get your post removed if you stated it? \n\n\nIf yes, NAH. No wonder you are competing in the Martyr Olympics and annoyed about your SIL\u2019s entry into it whilst in an ostensibly loving relationship with your brother. You were in an abusive relationship, you have PPD, you have Irish twins, you have body dysmorphia and you aren\u2019t even 20. That\u2019s a steaming heap of shit and could break just about any adult. It\u2019s a laugh it off or else you\u2019d just cry and never stop sort of situation for you and you don\u2019t have time or energy to deal with people who, when compared to what you went through and what you are going through, should have their shit a lot more together. \n\n\n\nBut your SIL is not an AH for her legitimate feelings related to her own trauma, baggage, stress, and infant. People all experience trauma and pain differently. Some people have higher pain tolerance than others. Some people have deeper wells of reserve strength. Which is why comparing misery never gets us anywhere and only ever makes trauma one-upmanship gross. \n\n\n\nIMO, you do owe your SIL an apology. Her struggles are legitimate and invalidating her feelings isn\u2019t ok. With that said, she\u2019s trying to connect with you.

Let her in and help her understand how you\u2019d like to be supported in your post-partum journey and then ask the same of her.

No. She was trying to connect with you over a shared experience. YOU turned it into a suffering contest and equated pain with the validity of motherhood. YOU turned the conversation so that she felt like she had to \"prove\" to you that she was a \"real\" mother because her baby didn't burst out of her torso or tear her whisker-biscuit all to hell.

I get that you bump heads with her on certain things but that doesn\u2019t give you the right to treat her so horribly, on top of the fact you gave her a half assed apology.

You sound very insensitive about her feelings. You should be happy for her and happy that your kids will grow up together so close in age instead of gate keeping being a mom.

You didn't say if they've had losses, but maybe they have. You desperately want to be a mom. But then it turns out that oh hey, you actually can't get pregnant after all. Surrogacy, for whatever reason, isn't an option, so you adopt. \n\nNow picture that you're that person, and your teenage SIL gets pregnant twice without even trying. \n\nSo here she is, the odd one out.

She doesn't know what it is like to physically birth a child, and you don't know the pain of fertility treatments, hopes dashed, and adoption. Your belief that you are clearly so much worse off (poor little baby,) is so limited, and then to look for validation and ignore the YTAs is just sad.", "Nah, you are a major asshole.

Your SIL has to deal with clique-y mean girl SILs who make her feel even more alone in her experience of motherhood, 1-3.

Been there. THAT is Hell, and for many women already makes them feel like less. \n\nOP's attitude makes me think she will never see the adopted child as \"really\" her SIL's child, and not \"really\" part of the family.

Everyone around you should be proud of you for that. People who've never experienced an abusive relationship simply can't wrap their heads around it.

I've also tried all the prescription and over-the-counter painkillers possible, they don't work at all and/or make me so unpleasant, codeine makes me angry and even a Panadol makes my stomach hurt now so I avoid all pharmaceutical painkillers.
