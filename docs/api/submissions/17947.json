They're now four months old.\n\nMy niece is adopted after several years of my SIL and brother waiting and I am truly happy for them. My son was not as planned (ha) and I think their true want and preparation makes them absolutely amazing parents. \n\nBut my SIL and I have kinda butted heads. We're different in our parenting philosophies, but I try to put it on the back-burner, because ultimately they're babies (I do have a toddler, but he's very young) and either of us could change. \n\nAnyway, the issue at hand. I was talking to my sister about baby troubles last week. I suffer from severe post partum anxiety and have recently got back on meds. \n\nMy SIL added in that newborns can be difficult, I agreed, moved on with my sistef. She continued to talk about difficult newborn milestones, and eventually, my sister brought up her nerve damage from her c-sec. I also have nerve damage from my first, and we then got onto the struggles of newborns while recovering.\n\nMy SIL was getting a little impatient and annoyed, talking about how she struggled too. I told her than we all struggled, but \"theres no struggle like changing a diaper with split stitches\" (paraphrasing). Also mentioned sore boobs and mastitis.\n\nShe, essentially, told me that there was \"no real comparison\" and she didn't struggle less than me because she didn't recover from birth. I said it absolutely made a difference and I, without a doubt, struggled more than her. \n\nShe got upset then and I ended up telling her she didn't understand the true hell of the newborn stage. I know it was an asshole thing to say and definitely hurt her more than I intended.\n\nShe left and has removed both my sister and I on all platforms. \n\nMy brother eventually told us, after a few days, that she was just trying to be a part of our \"clique\" and she feels like she doesn't fit in with us because they adopted. \n\nI fully get that but she should just say that rather than trying to add in her thoughts where they aren't needed. She doesn't understand post partum recovery and thats fine.\n\nI did shoot her a text to apologise but she is still really hurt. Was I really that much of an asshole? I know I was, at least a bit, but I don't think its ignore for a week levels.\n\nI guess this is less \"Am I the asshole?\" and more \"Am I the only asshole?\" Hah.\n\nETA; Ages. Apparently they're important.

She likely feels alone. Her struggles are the adoption process, not being treated as a real mom, or possibly sadness of not experiencing child birth. I'm curious to learn from adoptive parents.\n\nShe does want to feel heard and seen and *is* a real mom.

My moms body was pumped with hormones and she had to take muscular shots and after all that the doctor then told them that the likelihood of having a biological child was very unlikely. \n\nHas your SIL done in-vitro, how many miscarriages has she had, how often has she wished she could bond with her baby by breastfeeding or have felt the baby kick or just even the fact that part of her hurdle as a mother is comforting a child that doesn\u2019t recognize her and eventually having to deal with helping that child through the trauma of being put up for adoption. \n\nHas it occurred to you that she, despite the pain and nerve damage and how much she loves her baby, wishes she could do what your body was able to do. \n\nThat\u2019s trauma too. That\u2019s pain too. You seem to be so intent on dismissing her experience of being \u201cnot as bad\u201d because it\u2019s not your experience. But you have completely missed the point she has other trauma and hurdles and things that made her leave her body and effort all on the field too. Why did talking with your sister also need to include denouncing your SIL\u2019s experience. It sounds like you weren\u2019t even willing to let her chime in without one upping her from how you describe things.", "Shush never tell my husband this \ud83d\ude09\nWe decided on no operation for his for the the rerupture rate also.\nIn all seriousness I hope you heal well and your prognosis is good from memory the first few weeks wear the worse", "I had a scheduled C section with my youngest. He turned breech and I was high risk with not enough amniotic fluid. You\u2019d never know now!", "Unpleasant is certainly a way to describe him hah. We are far away from him. My SIL is aware but isn't one I could talk about this with. She's very, er, \"should have helped yourself\" about it. \n\nI have looked into cannabis, but its illegal in my state, and I'd vowed to stop breaking the law when I had kids lmao.", "Trust me, no more. Didn't even fuckin want kids to begin with, but I guess I got em now.\n\nI get it, though. I apologised. It is what it is.", "I have two, the one is a decent human, we can chat and have a glass of wine and enjoy a night together the other is just bad news \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc4e Only her opinion is the right way. Never has anything positive to say if I'm there. I could go on.. \ud83d\ude06 Good luck!!", "This ! Don\u2019t let people make you feel bad and give into her. There will be more issues down the line.", "I hope you are able to get to a safer place.", "Wait wait wait. Your bf/husband doesn\u2019t *allow* you to be on birth control? And impregnated you when you were 3 weeks post partum?", "Not anybody. Just anybody who would do such a thing.\n\nYour issue is not with your SIL.", "Nope, you still don't get it. The pain of infertility is overwhelming, much more so than physical pain. I get that you and your sister wanted to discuss \"war wounds\" but you shouldn't have dismissed her like that.", "The pain she went through while trying to have a baby will stay with her for the rest of her life. My mom went through fertility struggles when she was trying to get pregnant with me over 30 years ago. The pain has eased over time but it has yet to go away. She still has triggers from it. Please develop some empathy.", "I'd bet!\n\nLet things calm down. Reach out, apologise, explain that you're overwhelmed and struggling. If she's worth anything she'll understand. May not forgive you, but she will understand.", "She hasn't experienced any of that, and I'm sorry your mother did. She had a hysterectomy and waited to adopt.\n\nI was being an asshole. I wanted to talk to my sister about my personal struggles. I'm sorry.", "My orthopedist team is so pleased with how my Achilles healed they are actually going to stop doing surgery a lot. They said it barely added to the healing time, remember I had both so that added time either way and difficulties. I take meds and chemo for serious issues including leukemia and it was levaquin that caused the rupture in the first place (an antibiotic your husband now needs to avoid if they didn't tell you as it can easily cause reruptures). However all my issues and the bedrest weakened my back so 5 of my vertebrae literally broke. Which is why I'm learning to move again. That brace just came off part time yesterday actually after almost 4 months of full time. Couldn't even pull my pants up using the bathroom for at least a month and am still using a walker most of the time. Just saying it can be as rough as labor sometimes. And OP is being extremely judgmental and gatekeeping over everything. I hope your husband is doing well and it is nice to hear of someone else they opted against surgery with. My orthopedist team said they now intend to do surgery on probably only half the patients they were after my progress, especially since it means if I have issues in future surgery will be an option we have a better chance with. I'm keeping the walking boots/casts and walkers etc though just in case I need them again.", "Thats great! Unfortunately I have long term damage from mine (my sisters even worse) so I shall know forever.", "Just to be clear I 100% do not agree with the burden statement, it was a similarly emotional topic as an example.", "Were abortion or adoption not an option? People who don't want kids generally don't make very good parents, it's one of the reasons making abortions difficult for people in the stares was such a terrible decision from a societal standpoint. I hope things work out at least OK for you both.", "Thanks! Hah. I only have the one SIL. My other brother is gay. His husband is pretty cool though lmao.", "I am now! We're safe.", "We are no longer together. But yes.", "My issue is with my SIL. My childrens conception literally isn't relevant here and I'm not sure how I got onto it.", "I apologised. I mean, what was I supposed to do? I tried to change the conversation when she came over because my sister and SIL always fight over parenting. (You think I was an asshole? You should hear the things they say to each other.)\n\nIt didn't work and I got nasty.", "Ok. Thank you. And I think you have every right to commiserate with your sister. But maybe just be cognizant of the time and place if SIL is there. I think it would make everyone less on edge. And likely make her less focused on proving her struggles as well. \n\nCan I ask if there\u2019s a medical reason for the hysterectomy? For someone who wants to have kids that\u2019s pretty rare unless they where in an accident, had medical trauma or disease or did it as a preemptive measure to avoid diseases like cancers that run in families.\n\nAnd I\u2019m saying this with love. And all I want to do is help reframe here. I think sometimes we all get really focused on our own experiences and we can lose the forest for the trees. So this doesn\u2019t mean your being a bad person. Maybe you just lost some foresight here.", "I didn't think you did lmao. I get why you said it, no worries.", "No and no. My (ex) partner would never allow abortion. Adoption was off the table for me. I wouldn't have been able to give my first up until recently anyway, and theres no way I'd give up my toddler, and I didn't see the point in giving up my second if I was keeping his brother.\n\nI go to parenting classes and therapy to be the best parent I can be for them.", "Good! I hope your babies are able to bless your life and that you're able to find peace with your family. It's so easy for women to feel like we have to tear eachother down to justify our own pains, but we are so much stronger when we build eachother up instead.", "You're 19 and have two kids. Your SIL is not the problem here.", "INFO: Do you know you aren\u2019t the center of the universe?", "I don't know if there was a medical reason. I was like ten and I don't feel like its appropriate to ask now.", "Thank you. My boys are all good in my life.", "My kids were not my doing. But I will love and care for them regardless. \n\nI can have issues with my SIL. I do have issues with her. Thats why we have this situation.", "Oh shit, really??"]}
