It sounds as if they feel as though they feel they are owed compensation for raising you. (Which is something that is not only common practice, but is codified in law in many east Asian cultures, by the way.

This has nothing to do with your parents. \nThey are using Allie as a financial pawn, and need to mind their business. You are just trying to do right by your daughter.", "You didn't imply, you said I don't trust you with my child. I have to assume that you absolutely no problem with your child's new stepmother.

Are your parents planning on burying you? This is an extremely weird conversation for them to initiate and it's even weirder that they're mad at you and have sicced their flying monkeys on you over it. Of course your estate would go to your child.", "NTA. Your parents are literally angry over a potentiality and banking on it when, in reality, they'll probably pass before you do. It's a really weird thing to have a fit over. And to say they need it more than your ex is exactly why I wouldn't trust them either. The money isn't about personal need, it's about caring for your daughter. As far as you telling them you don't trust them because of how they're acting, you said nothing wrong. But people love to play victim and run with the \"I don't trust you\" part while conveniently dumping the \"because of how you're behaving\" part.", "NTA.

I'm not knocking on deaths door or anything lol.", "I'm not sure that's unique to east Asian...\n\nMy - limited - understanding is that's common practice for probate in the US.

There are mechanisms - usually trusts (even if just created as needed by the will) - that can properly address these things.\n\nFor example, if both myself and spouse die while we have a minor child, our funds go into a trust for the child. \n\nIf only one of us dies, our funds flow to the surviving spouse. But if we ever got divorced, and especially if one of us was getting remarried, I'd have our will changed such that the money would bypass the spouse and go directly to the child's trust, with provisions that the surviving spouse could have limited access to funds for the sole purpose of supporting our child. \n\nThis way you don't have to worry about the funds disappearing, or getting split between multiple families/kids.

Chris gets all your life insurance and savings, without a pre-nup.  Let's say Chris dies later that same year. Depending on how Chris has his side setup, your Allie might get $0 or might get 25% of Chris's estate (with the rest being equally split between his spouse and two other kids).\n\nMinimally, you have the ability to set things up so Allie gets 100% of your estate (with Chris - or Allie's guard - having access if needed for Allie's benefit while underage).\n\nYou can take a small step to ensue Allie's gets the resources you'd expect if the worst occurs.", "NTA but please speak with an estate planner. There are ways to set up a trust for assets for your daughter that don\u2019t involve leaving the money to your ex. \n\nThis may be beneficial for your ex to also speak with an estate planner to leave assets for both your daughter and his spouse", "NTA. And in the event of something happening to you,   why would your child go to your parents when your child has a fully functioning, willing and able second parent? That doesn't even make else and I question your parents motive.", "Wow. This doesn't make sense to me. If something were to happen to you, your ex will still be required to care for your daughter, and provide for her. The obvious choice is to provide him with the means to do so if possible.

Nah, keep it like it is.", "NTA, the chance of you or your ex passing away before your daughter becomes old enough for her to be the direct beneficiary is very slim. It's also a very slim chance that you'll be outlived by your parents. It sounds like you've made a sensible insurance policy to protect your daughter in the event of something awful happening while she's young. She's your daughter, so if you and her father are satisfied with this plan and he doesn't plan to change his will given his new relationship, that's all that matters. I'm assuming that once your daughter is old enough, you'll both change your wills?

NTA", "NTA you have a financial obligation to your child, not your parents.", "NTA. You told your parents the truth. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. If anything were to happen to you, your ex would still need the resources you plan on leaving for your daughter even if he has a wife. Probably more so because he may have other children he may have to care for. Having anything from you would allow him to continue caring for your daughter at the same level as the pair of you do now.\n\nI do not have children nor do I plan on having any. However, I told my mother that were I to have kids she would not be the person I would name as guardian if both myself and the other parent were to die young. She\u2019s older, has less patience and has a LOT of health problems. Did she like this? No. Did it matter? No. Because I would, hypothetically, be acting in the best interests of my (fictional) child.\n\nYou have to do whatever is in the best interests of your child, regardless of who it offends or pisses off. \n\nYour ex is like to get more insurance in the future for his fianc\u00e9 and any children they may have. A lot of people do this when they have children from previous relationships. You\u2019ll likely do this as well should you form a relationship that close with someone.\n\nYour parents need to get over themselves. They had their turn in being parents, they made mistakes. You\u2019re a mother now and your are doing everything in your power not to make the same mistakes.", "NTA", "NTA. Sounds like your parents are pretty awful. Good call not trusting them.", "NTA I\u2019m completely lost. If you died, your ex would get full custody of the children because they are his children. Your parents would have no rights whatsoever. So your parents are saying you should disinherit your children in their favor because your ex remarried? That makes no sense. Why would they expect a penny of your money when you have heirs youself? All your money should go to the maintenance of your children.\n\nI *would* suggest revisiting your will to ensure your children are protected in the event your ex died after you. My family members ended up losing everything to their step parent because their father died, and their mother remarried and then died while they were still minors. They ended up 18 with nothing from either parents\u2019 estate. Their stepfather owns practically everything their father and mother left behind.\n\nPutting the money in a trust with the proceeds to be used for the children\u2019s care would make more sense than giving it to your ex outright (for example).

What if they have a ton of kids and decide to   use the money for something other than it's intended purpose?  It's also possible your parents are gold digging assholes. It might be worth a conversation about why they think this change needs to be made.", "Hence the person you replied to saying \"the default is\".", "NTA, you mentioned you grew up in a dysfunctional household which probably led you to the decision you made with Chris awhile ago. Fussing over money they don't have access to let's u know you made the right decision.", "NTA.  Being blunt ensures clarity and gets the drama, if there's going to be any, out in the open right away.  Sometimes parents are kind, generous, thoughtful and teach their kids to live in a healthy and happy manner.  It sounds like your parents are not really in that camp.\n\nAt least your parents showed their colors quickly and you don't have to doubt your choices about them.  This must be sad for you, but you're handling it beautifully IMO. \n\nKudos to you and Chris for being really good parents and for prioritizing your daughter.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur parents are the AHs.", "You may need to sit down and ask your parents about their financial troubles.

Why the hell do your parents even think they'll outlive you? Creepy AF.", "NTA but there is definitely better ways to ensure your money goes to your CHIlD and not your ex. That's what they are upset about.", "NYA. Your kids\u2019 needs come before those of your parents. \n\nOne comment: cleanest thing to do would be to set up a trust for your daughter and have your money go into that. That would guarantee the money goes to your daughter.

Keep up the good work.", "I would look into changing your will to a trust for your Daughter that Ex has access to for living expenses/child support until she is 18-21 and then it\u2019s hers.", "I suspect it's just plain narcissism rather than a conscious desire to have the money.", "There was actually a woman who did that to her DIL.
