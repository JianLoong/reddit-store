Despite us not being together, we have a really good coparenting relationship, mostly due to the fact that we both grew up in homes with dysfunctional family dynamics and we didn\u2019t want the same for our kid.\n\nWhen he and I ended things, we both agreed to mutually make eachother the inheritors of our will & life insurance. We did this so that if something happened to one of us, the other would have the funds to care for our daughter as though both of us were still here. There is money we have set aside specifically for her to use as she wishes, but she won\u2019t be able to access the account until she\u2019s 18.\n\nMy parents were aware of this arrangement we had, and at the time they didn\u2019t express any issues with it.\n\nChris is getting married soon to his fianc\u00e9e Maya (31f), and after hearing about the engagement, my parents have asked me if I\u2019m going to be naming them as my beneficiaries.\n\nI informed them that I wouldn\u2019t be, and they got upset and told me that it\u2019s ridiculous for me to give everything to my ex when he\u2019ll clearly be able to support Allie with a two household income and that they would benefit from an inheritance more than he would.\n\nI said that I wouldn\u2019t be changing my mind, and I told them that with the way they\u2019re acting about it now, I trust Chris even more to use the money to care for our daughter than I do them.\n\nSo now my parents are telling our family members that I don\u2019t trust them with money, or my child\u2019s well-being if something were to happen to me. Most of my family is now calling me all sorts of names but mostly just saying how awful it is for me to think of my parents this way.\n\nHonestly I sort of don\u2019t trust my mom and dad, mainly due to how they\u2019re acting now, but maybe it was wrong of me to tell them that so plainly?", "created_utc": 1682141535, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12uvysq/aita_for_more_or_less_telling_my_parents_that_i/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I pretty much implied to my parents that I don't trust them to care for my daughter if I left them in control of my money. 2.

There was no reason for them to even bring this up, unless they've been looking for an excuse to stick their fingers in that money from the start.  And then they *proved* they can't be trusted to respect your decisions or your intent, because instead of graciously accepting your No they roped as many uninvolved third parties as they could reasonably find to try and mass shame/guilt you into complying.\n\nPlease for the love of all that is sacred to you give these people *nothing* and make sure it goes to your child.

They know something you don't about their likelihood to outlive you? TF?", "NTA.   \n\n\nYou stated that you and Chris both come from dysfunctional families. You are showing an example this through the behavior of your parents.   \n\n\nI think it is very odd for parents of a 29-year-old to be asking about being inheritors of their own daughter. It sounds as if they feel as though they feel they are owed compensation for raising you. (Which is something that is not only common practice, but is codified in law in many east Asian cultures, by the way. If my Korean wife dies and we don't have kids, her parents are entitled to inheritance.)\n\nKeep being there for your daughter. Keep the good relationship with her father and her new step-mother. Keep that positive atmosphere for her.", "NTA\n\nIf something should happen to you, your child belongs with her other loving parent.\n\nThe only thing I can advice is that if the life  insurance / inheritance is put into some sort of trust so that it is spent for your child's needs  in case your ex remarries and possibly has more kids.  Both of you should talk about that as you have good communication, and trust  with each other.\n\nYou both seem to care about your child and that is the most important person should something happen to either of you.", "NTA. I mean what the hell, it\u2019s super scary that they expect to outlive you. \nI don\u2019t know any parents, no matter how shitty they are, that would even think about benefitting from their children\u2019s inheritance.\nEven if you were terminally ill it would never ever justify them expecting to get the money rather than your ex/daughter.\n\nThe only thing I was wondering about is why your daughter isn\u2019t inheriting the money? It could be set up so she won\u2019t be able to access it before she is 18, but your husband is allowed to take money out for her care.", " NTA and your life sounds like the beginning of a 20/20 episode.", "NTA. I agree with you and I don\u2019t think you said anything wrong. Most parents (imo) would be so horrified at the idea of their kids dying before them that they aren\u2019t even thinking about what happens to the money.", "Your parents are being parasites. Ignore them.\n\nYou have an excellent relationship with your ex and really don't need parental interference. \n\nA word of caution, though: I suspect your ex might want to revisit the arrangements when he gets married, so that he leaves some of his assets to his wife. Legally, she may have a claim on them as his dependant anyway, particularly if they have kids. Likewise, if you meet a new partner/have more kids you'll likely want to change your will. It's worth thinking about the various options now so you're prepared.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nTHEY chose to make the conflict public.  Not you.  \nAnd if you do pass, Chris would get full custody as the full surviving parent.  It's upto you how you choose to set up the will and life insurance.  \n\nFWIW, you and Chris might want to consider how to setup your plans for Allie as Chris' family expands, and as yours might in the future.  Chris now has two people to plan for if he passes, and he soon might have more kids.  \n\nYour parent's opinions matter not at all.  Maya's opinion will and should matter to Chris.  So, bring it up now and talk over how to adjust your own plans, and I bet he'll be relieved to have the chance to redesign the plans a little.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This has nothing to do with your parents. \nThey are using Allie as a financial pawn, and need to mind their business. You are just trying to do right by your daughter.", "You didn't imply, you said I don't trust you with my child. I have to assume that you absolutely no problem with your child's new stepmother. BTW, I don't see your parents caring for your child anymore.", "NTA. You don\u2019t trust them for good reason. If they don\u2019t understand why, that just enforces your logic.", "NTA. Are your parents planning on burying you? This is an extremely weird conversation for them to initiate and it's even weirder that they're mad at you and have sicced their flying monkeys on you over it. Of course your estate would go to your child.", "NTA. Your parents are literally angry over a potentiality and banking on it when, in reality, they'll probably pass before you do. It's a really weird thing to have a fit over. And to say they need it more than your ex is exactly why I wouldn't trust them either. The money isn't about personal need, it's about caring for your daughter. As far as you telling them you don't trust them because of how they're acting, you said nothing wrong. But people love to play victim and run with the \"I don't trust you\" part while conveniently dumping the \"because of how you're behaving\" part.", "NTA. What parents plan to outlive their own child and then get offended about not getting a payout? Starting to understand your comment about dysfunctional childhood\u2026", ">that they would benefit from an inheritance more than he would.\n\nThis is proof that they want the money for themselves not your daughter.

I'm not knocking on deaths door or anything lol.", "I'm not sure that's unique to east Asian...\n\nMy - limited - understanding is that's common practice for probate in the US. If you - and spouse - die without hiers, the default is to \"flow up\" to your ancestors (aka parents) and then start flowing out to your siblings.", "I certainly hope it doesn't end like one lol.", "And in the reverse, any money left to the ex could end up property of the new wife.\n\nWould be a great time to visit with an estate planer and ensure things are setup for the INTENDED BENEFIT of your kids.  There are mechanisms - usually trusts (even if just created as needed by the will) - that can properly address these things.\n\nFor example, if both myself and spouse die while we have a minor child, our funds go into a trust for the child. \n\nIf only one of us dies, our funds flow to the surviving spouse. But if we ever got divorced, and especially if one of us was getting remarried, I'd have our will changed such that the money would bypass the spouse and go directly to the child's trust, with provisions that the surviving spouse could have limited access to funds for the sole purpose of supporting our child. \n\nThis way you don't have to worry about the funds disappearing, or getting split between multiple families/kids.  (Although the ex's situation is going to be more challenging, as presumably he won't leave 100% to OP and children anymore...)", "He and I started talking about it when he started dating Maya, and since I don't plan to have another child, he'll remain the beneficiary. If he and Maya have a child together, he plans to name both in his will. Then, if I meet someone down the line and decide to get married, we'll all reevaluate then.", "Only if there's no will.", "Wow, you guys are doing a great job at this.", "I have assume that you have problem trusting your child' s new stepmother.", "I'd advise reconsidering this...\n\nI'm sure Chris is trustworthy, and Maya is as well, but money can make people do stupid things...\n\nAny hypothetically, let's say that you die in 7 years, by then Chris and Maya have two kids.  Chris gets all your life insurance and savings, without a pre-nup.  Let's say Chris dies later that same year. Depending on how Chris has his side setup, your Allie might get $0 or might get 25% of Chris's estate (with the rest being equally split between his spouse and two other kids).\n\nMinimally, you have the ability to set things up so Allie gets 100% of your estate (with Chris - or Allie's guard - having access if needed for Allie's benefit while underage).\n\nYou can take a small step to ensue Allie's gets the resources you'd expect if the worst occurs."]}
