{"id": 2160, "submission_id": "ytmc99", "title": "AITA for telling my neighbour i will expect them to pick up my dogs mess?", "selftext": "I (25f) have just moved into a 2 bedroom house with my toddler and 2 dogs (doberman cross collie, Bruce and english bulldog, Cali) Im also 33 weeks pregnant. Now i am a mindful dog owner, i know alot of people dont tolerate dogs barking so i try to keep my dogs noise to a minimum. Obviously this does not workout all the time and Bruce does go on a barking spree (as im sure most dogs do on some days)\n\nI let my dogs out on a 2:1 ratio. In the house for 2 hours and having a run in the garden for 1 (this is obviously depending on weather) this ratio works out for most the day. They first go out a 8am to do their business, have a run and come back in for 9am once my daughter has had breakfast. If im due to leave the house early then i leave them out for an extra half hour. Bruce loves to run after the birds in our garden and sometimes has a bark at them, his barking never goes on for more than 10 minutes and if it ever does i will bring him inside a little earlier. The last time they go out  an hour is at 7 when i go to bath my toddler and do bedtime routine. They are normally in by 8 at the latest and then between half 10-11 for their last toilet time.\n\nYesterday i had a knock on my door from a neighbour saying i was letting my dogs out too early and he demanded i keep them in until atleast 11am as when bruce barks it wakes him up (cali doesnt bark and when she does it sounds more like shes coughing). I told him that theres no way i could keep them in the house for 12 hours plus as its cruel and they need to be able to go to the bathroom. He then said its not his problem and i need to figure it out. So i politely said \u201cok, i can keep them in until 11 but what time should i expect you over to clean up the mess they make in the meantime?\u201d \nHe looks at me confused and i said \u201cwell if you are demanding i keep my dogs in then you must be willing to clean the mess they make when they need the toilet\u201d he then started screaming about how i have no respct for people on the street and how he\u2019s going to complain to the council about it.\n\nI dont think ive done anything wrong as he shouldnt expect me to deal with my dogs mess in my house and around my toddler because he doesnt want them running around my garden before 11am but some of my friends are agreeing with him and telling me to keep them in\u2026So AITA?\n\n\nEdit to add a few things:\n1. I do walk my dogs! I dont know where this assumption has come from but at 8am i am looking after my toddler. Also due to pregnancy issues ive had to look at getting a dog walker as they are getting too strong for me to walk being heavily pregnant.\n\n2. Bruce doesnt bark constantly for 10 mins every 2 hours. He will give a few barks every couple of minutes for no more than 10 mins as it bugs me after about 5mins of hearing it. \n\n3. I would like to add that nearly every house on the street has dogs, during the day its like barking galore so the fact that bruce barks for maybe a total of 30 mins spread over 12 hours of the day doesnt seem excessive to me but he has a problem with my dog barking. None of the others (hes not even the loudest dog barking on the street, or the most annoying)\n\nEdit 2:\n\nThis neighbour does not work, he does not go to any sort of school (from home or leaving the house)  he sits in his front garden most of the day talking to his friends (i think its all dodgy and drug related)", "created_utc": 1668297444, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytmc99/aita_for_telling_my_neighbour_i_will_expect_them/", "score": 372, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Now i am a mindful dog owner, i know alot of people dont tolerate dogs barking so i try to keep my dogs noise to a minimum. Obviously this does not workout all the time and Bruce does go on a barking spree (as im sure most dogs do on some days)\n\nI let my dogs out on a 2:1 ratio. In the house for 2 hours and having a run in the garden for 1 (this is obviously depending on weather) this ratio works out for most the day. They first go out a 8am to do their business, have a run and come back in for 9am once my daughter has had breakfast. If im due to leave the house early then i leave them out for an extra half hour. Bruce loves to run after the birds in our garden and sometimes has a bark at them, his barking never goes on for more than 10 minutes and if it ever does i will bring him inside a little earlier. The last time they go out  an hour is at 7 when i go to bath my toddler and do bedtime routine. They are normally in by 8 at the latest and then between half 10-11 for their last toilet time.\n\nYesterday i had a knock on my door from a neighbour saying i was letting my dogs out too early and he demanded i keep them in until atleast 11am as when bruce barks it wakes him up (cali doesnt bark and when she does it sounds more like shes coughing). I told him that theres no way i could keep them in the house for 12 hours plus as its cruel and they need to be able to go to the bathroom. He then said its not his problem and i need to figure it out. So i politely said \u201cok, i can keep them in until 11 but what time should i expect you over to clean up the mess they make in the meantime?\u201d \nHe looks at me confused and i said \u201cwell if you are demanding i keep my dogs in then you must be willing to clean the mess they make when they need the toilet\u201d he then started screaming about how i have no respct for people on the street and how he\u2019s going to complain to the council about it.\n\nI dont think ive done anything wrong as he shouldnt expect me to deal with my dogs mess in my house and around my toddler because he doesnt want them running around my garden before 11am but some of my friends are agreeing with him and telling me to keep them in\u2026So AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They will bark as an alarm (i.e. strangers approaching the house) 1-5 barks (barks, not minutes) tops, which I could probably train out, but actually like.\n\nAnything more they get called in, or if in the house, sent to bed (single command, basically told to knock it off and go calm down on their bed).\n\nEdit - just saw a comment where OP says they bark 'a few' times in a ten minute period,  which seems more reasonable, if accurate, but should still be discouraged, even if other dogs are noisy, theirs don't have to be. \n\n*To OP - I'm assuming they like being outside? Bring them in at the first bark, every time. It's annoying for a while, but they'll figure it out fairly quickly, and then the odd time they do slip up, it just reinforces the training you've put down. I know training can be tiring when you're already juggling a lot, but it's an investment that really pays out.*", "He doesnt bark constantly, it would be a few barks hear and there every few minutes that maybe goes on for about 10 minutes.

Stares at me for \u201ctwo!\u201d and then runs inside when I go \u201cTHREE!\u201d because he knows the next one is being put in his kennel for a minute and he doesn\u2019t want that hahaha. \n\nHave also unintentionally taught him that me knocking on the screen door window is also a signal to come running to the door. Love that one cause I don\u2019t have to open the door until he\u2019s there!", "Letting them out is a lot different than leaving them out unattended for an hour. I dont think the neighbor would have issues with OP letting them out to do their business at 8 and then bringing them back inside. If she does that they wont be barking for 10 minutes in the mornings.", "Also, most noise ordinances end earlier than 8 am. I have a neighbor who mows his yard at 7 am every Saturday (my only sleep in day) and I hate him with a burning passion for that, but he's technically not doing anything wrong so I suck it up.", "IME, 8 AM is pretty late to be getting ready for work, and 9 is late to be starting. I honestly don\u2019t know anyone who doesn\u2019t start work around 8. Definitely not the crack of dawn, for sure.", "Agreed, but sounds like this dog isnt trained very well if it barks for a half hour a day\u2026", "I asked my next door neighbour about it as for me it was strange that there are many other dogs that bark more around him, she said it was odd as he never said anything to the dog owners in the other houses and shes even said my dog barking is very far a few between from what she hears. And shes next door to me\u2026 this guy is about 4 houses away from me.", "One of my neighbors has two pit mixes. I can always tell when mom is home versus dad, because those dogs do not bark when she is there. Just dad? Fair game, and they will bark their heads off when I walk past. \n\nIt\u2019s like I can read their adorable dog faces when I go past, because I can tell they WANT to bark, but their brains are saying, \u201cMom is home and we will get in all of the trouble!\u201d", "100% correct. OP is a terrible dog owner AND neighbor and refuses to believe otherwise because they \u201ccouldn\u2019t possibly be wrong\u201d.", "Oh you wouldn\u2019t just tell them \u201cok I\u2019ll keep them from barking if you come clean up their shit\u201d like OP? \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude44", "Glad I\u2019m not the only one that noticed that", "She's ridiculous. I can't imagine her in a restaurant, or a pharmacy, or a movie theater.", "I disagree just because it is absolutely not normal for a dog to bark that long at any interval. op is ignoring all these comments and getting defensive but the dog is clearly not trained very well and it is a nuisance to everyone. Yes, people who work nighttime hours are going to have to deal with normal daytime lights and sounds. Excessively barking dogs, which this is, is not normal daytime sounds.", "I'm neither young, nor American - a lie in past 8am it's great at the weekend.", "As if a toddler would cry multiple times in a space of 10mins every day around the same time. Toddlers (2-3 years old) who has normal development milestone, usually cry when they in pain or when their needs not met with other method of communications. If a toddler feels need to cry for every single day, couple of times a day, either the parents are inflicting pain or the toddler need to see a therapist.", "Half of her comments are just repeating the same dreck and none of them display self-awareness or learning.", "All of my neighbors have dogs. And once one start to bark they all do. Making me really dislike living next to dogs. 2 minutes of barking is WAY to much. There should be harsher laws about it", "school starts at or before 8am where i am. busses run from around 5:30 or 6:00 am till the normal drop off time that i\u2019m not sure of but i would assume around 7:15-7:30 to allow for breakfast to be eaten. you also can\u2019t expect someone to walk dogs in the dark as a child.", "A) those dogs aren't in his next door neighbors yard,  so he doesn't hear them as much. \n\nB) You should not let your dogs bark continuously.  They start barking, you go correct then or bring them in \n\nC) They don't sound well trained if they are barking contuiously and you can't have them in the house while you're taking care of your kid.", "Maybe because you live directly next door to him? There might be other dogs in the neighborhood that can bark louder, but I'd wager that those dogs other barking dogs aren't directly next to him like you are. \n\nHonestly, this just sounds petty.\n\nHave you tried one of those bark collars that just makes a really annoying beep when the dog barks? That shuts my dog up pretty fast, and it doesn't shock the dog or anything. It just makes a noise when they bark that interrupts them.", "Just cuz other people have dogs who bark doesn\u2019t mean you can too", "Instead of reasons for why you shouldn\u2019t have to keep your dogs from barking, imagine if your neighbor had a dog that always barked and woke your daughter up while she slept, or your new baby on the way. \n\nYou don\u2019t know his circumstances nor does he know yours, but neighborly compassion goes a long way.", "Other dogs are barking. That's the excuse you are using now. If your dog was well trained we would not be here listening to you deflect responsibility.", "There\u2019s a dog down my street that sounds like it\u2019s dying every time it is out outside. \n\nThat dog\u2019s bark drives me fucking insane. It sounds like it\u2019s being tortured, but it never lasts long so I know that dog just hates being outside. \n\nIt\u2019s across the street and north of me. I\u2019m not sure how many houses. But I hear THAT dog more than all the other dogs combined. \n\nYour dog may have a more bothersome bark, especially since you let it go on for ages before you intervene.", "It\u2019s not about the other dogs it\u2019s about yours that is the problem. If your bulldog won\u2019t do short potty trips, that\u2019s a training issue you haven\u2019t followed through on. If you\u2019ve tried and failed then you need a different trainer. \u201cPotty when asked\u201d is a puppy kindergarten lesson. If your dog won\u2019t stop barking then bring them inside and then it\u2019s crate time until they understand it\u2019s quiet time.", "My dogs have a huge backyard and get all their exercise there, no issues", "You are so selfish", "Well, then you're an absolute AH. Wtf do you even mean by that? You clearly can't handle taking care of two kids plus your dogs, and you're a very selfish and inconsiderate person.", "No you can't handle it. you admit you can't. You don't have the bandwidth to walk them more frequently hence the reason why you just let them out for an hour while you deal with your child. if your dogs were at least housebroken, you would have a dedicated area for them to use the bathroom to avoid it being unhygienic because you'd have one area to clean up. The easy solution here is you walk them first thing in the morning  at 8 then let them out at 10. It's a compromise for both of you but you can't walk them that early bc you're dealing with your kid and that's fine but don't act like you can handle it all bc you can't.", "I think you need to spend some time on r/dogtraining and take your judgment with grace", "Your style is not easy to maintain because you haven't even tried to do the basics. Just because other dogs bark, does not mean your dogs are not obnoxious nuisancees that are unwelcome. There's a distinct difference between a good mom, and what you think a good mom is. Hint: you are not a good mom to any of the living beings subjected to your \"care\"", "3-4 barks is a huge difference than a few minutes so which is it? You aren't very consistent in your description of the barking which says you don't have a very realistic view of how it actually is. \n\nAnd yes, unless you're in a dog park or have a large plot of land unfortunately that is exactly what you have to do- continuously tell your dogs not to talk. 'Thank you for the announcement, now you're done'.", "Your dog is not very well trained. It\u2019s shocking how ignorant you are.", "It is not the same thing,  you need to train them not to react.", "Obviously not if you don\u2019t exercise it properly and let it bark to blow of steam. Seems like you no literally nothing about dogs", "You don't have a clue about how obnoxious you and your dogs are. You do not have a well trained dog. You are not a responsible dog parent, I'm horrified to realize you were in charge of human babies. You need to understand that to have responsibility, you need to be responsible", "The only thing worse than a person\u2019s dog barking all the time is them creating more noise by shouting at the dog because they\u2019re so lazy and entitled that they can\u2019t get up off their butt and bring them in. Yeesh!", "I have a neighbor that does 6am in the summer. It was awful for the first 3 years we lived here. Our noise ordinance ends at 6am here. I used to dream about draining his lawnmower of its gas. But once I finally reglazed all my windows\u2026 I can\u2019t hear a thing :)", "Are you serious? You think that's a lot over an entire day?", "people are being harsh. I would say don\u2019t let him bark at all in the am before 9. If you hear one bark, take him inside. My dog likes to bark at the neighbors dogs and when they are outside I don\u2019t let him just bark, I lead him away from the fence so he can pee and then take him inside.", "NTA\n\nYour neighbor is an entitled AH.\n\nRecord future conversations for proof of harassment if he doesn't stop.", "LOL that reminds me of my youngest. He is a german shepard/pit. When daddy is near... he listens, he behaves, etc etc. firetruck goes by.,.. not a peep outta him when daddy is near.  \n\nDaddy at work.... firetruck goes by, and im fighting to shut all 3 up lol  my two oldest are a brother and sister who were dumped together so they had a very strong bond..... and of course im a sucker so i told the rescue they are staying with me... so they look at each other to decide should they howl or not. lol", "That is a huge maybe and highly dependent on the breed of dog. To often ppl get high drive breeds and stick them out back, for those dogs it is 100% expected for them to bark constantly 24/7. Hell, even well trained hi drive dogs are prone to frequent barking, so for them it is \u201cnormal\u201d just not functional for society. Which is why I said op needs to go above and beyond to simulate these dogs, but that doesn\u2019t make it out of the ordinary.", "If you don't like it then why not move?", "My dog is actually trained, she barks ONCE when she wants to be let in, and if she goes on a \"barking spree\" I bring her in right way (that's why she only barks once to be let in op, because I trained my dog)\n\nOp yta", "Yea she keeps changing the number of times the dog barks. She is clearly making it up to look like she has dine nothing wrong.", "Yes it will be 3/4 barks over a few minutes. Its not continous barking. It is literally a bark, maybe 2 barks together.. a break and then a bark again. Its not constant bark that he does. Also we have about 15 other dogs on our street that bark way louder and more than bruce and he seems to only have an issue with bruce barking.", "She really is ignorant and trying very hard to stay that way.", "that\u2019s sort of.. worse? i could go back to sleep after a dog had a fit for a couple minutes, but the noise repeating over and over every so often over an hour period, not so much. you need to actually invest your time in fixing this issue, instead of hand waving it away because it\u2019s more convenient for you to just plop them outside constantly.", "You keep bringing up all the other dogs in your neighbourhood, but they should have absolutely no consideration in this situation. Yes, perhaps they are worse offenders, but that doesn\u2019t excuse the situation with the dogs that you personally own and are responsible for. \n\nThat would be like saying, my neighbour is really upset I took his newspaper one time, but everyone else is way worse, they steal his paper every day!\n\nI get there are issues that make you feel like his requests are unreasonable, but they ultimately are issues that you are responsible for, and while I agree, it would be kind if your neighbour was more patient with you, it doesn\u2019t appear like you\u2019re willing to compromise. Could you consider some possible alternatives?\n\n1. You can\u2019t let the dogs out for a quick bathroom break because Cali won\u2019t do do it\u2019s business for half an hour after being let out. - well, cali doesn\u2019t bark, so that should be fine.\n\n2. But then \u201coh no\u201d, you add, cali can\u2019t be outside without Bruce, she doesn\u2019t like it\u2026 well, maybe you could try building up Cali\u2019s tolerance to being outside alone. Start with just 5 minutes alone and then give her lots of praise and attention, then build up her tolerance from there?\n\n3. You feel bad telling your dog to be quiet, like you are silencing his communication. Unfortunately, your job as a dog owner is to establish and enforce limits to help your dog learn what is acceptable behaviour. Maybe you lived somewhere with a lot more space before and this wasn\u2019t an issue, but now you have to help Bruce learn that there are new parameters. \nIf you feel like it\u2019s cruel to stifle Bruce\u2019s communication, maybe you could try out one of those button communication systems like that dog \u2018bunny\u2019 on YouTube. If Bruce can express himself another way, you might not feel bad telling him he\u2019s too loud. This would be the same as for a child, you can reinforce that at times they are being too loud, without forcing them to be completely silent.\n\nI just feel like there are possibilities for solutions or compromise, but you seem unwilling to explore as you\u2019ve thrown up your hands and said \u201cnot my problem, he just needs to learn to live with it\u201d.", "Then that means your dog is not well trained and you are not a responsible dog owner.", "Not everyone of those dogs is louder then yours. You seem to have a problem with him. You know so much about him take that time and energy and put it into training your dogs and being a mother.", "This is 8 am, not 2 am. The dog is outside. The neighbor is inside. This is not unreasonable"]}
