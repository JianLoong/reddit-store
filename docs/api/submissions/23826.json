Kim has always had a bad attitude to everyone especially me now before anyone assumes my fianc\u00e9 was already divorced his ex 2 years before we even met and his ex is a nice person who I get along with very well so there\u2019s no hate from her end ether. \n\nKim is 3 months pregnant and living with us because we have more room for her and the baby, the baby daddy stays sometimes but he has two jobs along with studies so it\u2019s mainly been me who\u2019s take care of her. \n\nSo the main issue today her boyfriend came over so my fianc\u00e9  suggested we let them have the house to themselves and go for a walk, about two hours later I came home and noticed my cat missing who Kim hated and wanted me to get rid of. I asked her were he was Kim said she ran out the door which I knew was bullshit whiskey is an elderly cat who even  wouldn\u2019t go out on the porch if I didn\u2019t bring him. So I checked the ring camera and as expected Kim threw whiskey out that ran her off. My fianc\u00e9 tried saying kim is pregnant her hormones are all over the place and pregnancy brain messes with women that he was gonna bring up getting rid of whiskey for the baby sake anyway.\n\nI was in tears till I looked over at kim with a smug satisfied look on her face I fucking lost it. I got up in her face and scream that she had one hour to find my cat or all her shit would be in the dumpster and I was done being her slave.\n\nShe said she wasn\u2019t looking for my stupid cat and back off as she was pregnant, my fianc\u00e9 told me to claim down and we\u2019d look for the cat \n\n\nI told him no I would look for my cat and when I got back his daughter better be gone and if he has issues he could go too because I was sick of dealing with his little bitch of daughter who everyone including her own parents and boyfriend avoids,\n\n\nI didn\u2019t wait for them to respond I did hear her crying tho, as you know I found my cat he was hiding in some bushes it took 20 long minutes to find him \n\n\nWhen I arrived home they were both in the living room my fianc\u00e9 said he wanted to talk but first he said I owed Kim an apology. I told him fuck himself and she better start packing \n\nShe\u2019s at her boyfriends family home as far as I know  and my fianc\u00e9 is not talking to me\n\n\nUpdate I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d give at least this soon \n\nSo my now ex fianc\u00e9 oldest daughter reached out to me to ask my side I\u2019ll call her Kate she\u2019s a animal lover like my self. Her father asked to stay with her for a few nights because he said I was having a break down over my cat he basically made out the cat escaped and I went after \u201cpOoR\u201d Kim for not trying to catch him her condition. Kate is a very smart girl she can see bull shit form a mile away and obviously she knows her own sister so she called Kim to ask her side. Kim was more honest basically her and her dad planned it as some of you suggested the plan was for her baby daddy to take the cat out a road dump but he wouldn\u2019t do it because in Kim\u2019s words he was a \u201cpussy\u201d so they got in a fight about it and Kim thankfully being lazy just kicked whiskey out and ran him out of the yard. Kate told me the way Kim\u2019s talking about me and whiskey even if she doesn\u2019t move back she do something for revenge to whiskey.  so I\u2019ve decided to listen to Kate,my friends, the vet, his assistant and everyone here and I called off the wedding which is in few weeks and broke up with my ex fianc\u00e9 by text I don\u2019t give a fk if it\u2019s immature or cruel I\u2019ve told him I\u2019ll box up his stuff for him and leave it for him to collect in a few days. Don\u2019t worry about whiskey I told my ex call me when he\u2019s coming over so he\u2019ll be locked in a room safe and I\u2019m calling a 24 hour lock smith next \n\nThe begging and bullshit promises have already started  but my minds made up I\u2019m done being his ATM slave for him and his spoiled bitch of a daughter (Kim)\n\nWhiskey is fine btw just a little shaken but he\u2019s curled up in my lap refusing to move", "created_utc": 1691110854, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15hlqca/aita_for_kicking_out_my_pregnant_teenage_step/", "score": 1098, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's pregnant and what did you say in your post? 3 months along?? what does she have? morning sickness??? big whoop! if that's why she needs total care then she's about to have a tough reality check when that baby gets here. I know so many women who have had sooo much worse handed to them during pregnancy so she honestly should be counting her blessings. TBH if the BD's parents don't like her and other people in her family avoid her that should be enough of a ringer to your fianc\u00e9 that somethings off with her and maybe he should be putting her in check when it comes to you and anyone else present around her when she starts trouble like that. The fact that he brushed this off too and doesn't think that his daughter owes you an apology is partly why she probably acts so entitled and stuck up. He allowed her to get away with being cruel and probably blamed it on stupid stuff in the past like 'oh she's on her period' or 'oh that's just how girls are to each other, all teenage girls can be catty at times' which is BS. Him enabling his daughter like that is going to be the reason no one will want anything to do with her as she gets older because it'll only get worse. They need a reality check to understand the world doesn't revolve around them and they are not entitled to everything being about them or having people bend over backwards at their every demands.
