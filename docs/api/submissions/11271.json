My husband's therapist advised that boundaries by the daughter-in-law wouldn't work. He said that the Son (my husband) had to set and enforce the boundaries with his mother, including how to treat his wife (me).\n\nThe more mad you get, the more she will do it. \n\nActing Unbothered is the way to go. And never open messages from the ex.", "NTA\n\nYou need to go zero contact with this woman, she has way over stepped her boundries. Don't let her control your marriage. I would literally ignore her, respect is a 2 way street, she doesn't just get it for free being a matriarch.", "NTA but your MIL has a 20 year relationship with the ex; don't expect much change.", "The AH is your MIL!!\nFirst: if she accuse you of being a brainwasher, ask her if she thinks her son is stupid. Tell her he is an adult, he is not dumb and he can believe whatever makes him sense and that is not your responsibility, but his own decision. He thinks by his own wtf. \n\nSecond: tell your husband to make her stop bringing up his ex girlfriend. That is so disrespectful and you don\u2019t deserve to be compared to her. If he doesn\u2019t stand up for you that\u2019s a big red flag. If he already tried and she doesn\u2019t stop tell him to try harder or you won\u2019t have a relationship with her. I really hate to cut up relationships and I don\u2019t like suggesting you to do it, but common! You don\u2019t deserve to be mistreated like that. You have been with you hb TEN years and he is happy, what is her problem? \n\nThird: I\u2019m not sure about this but maybe if you are comfortable with it and your husband approves it, you could talk with her (with your hb present) and tell her something like: hey I have been with your son 10 years, I now you don\u2019t like me, but he loves me and we are a happy couple. I will be your DIL you like it or not, so I suggest we two make an effort to be nice to each other and that means you have to stop accusing me of being a brain washer and talking and comparing me with his ex gf.

No. Contact. \n\nThis woman will not stop treating you this way and won\u2019t respect your boundaries. She is still wanting her son with a woman he was with as a *child*.

They have no business dictating what they think you and hubby are and how to live your lives.\n\nThat being said, I want to ask for INFO how your husband is handling this. I know you mentioned he \"supports you\", but are there other things he does? Like discussing what things to discuss with your MIL, what others topics best left alone, how often to communicate or see MIL because of this? What bounderies have you discussed to implement regarding your MIL? And what does he think of you going NC with MIL?\n\nUltimately, MIL is your husband's mother and my two cents is that he should be the one handling that relationship instead of you.", "NTA", "NTA. Time to limit ir go no contact with MIL.", "Nta. R/justnomil", "NTA\n\nWow, the MIL and exgf ganging up after all this time, weird. Does your partner know about that?", "I was so surprised I got the evil text. She called me every name you can think of. Told me she was better to my MIL and FIL lately.  Then told me she thought I was crazy for thinking she was still obsessed with my husband. I didn't even know how to respond.  Lol", "My husband is 100% supportive of how I feel with his mom. He tells her he hates how she acts toward me and he also tells her that she makes him feel stupid with her brainwashing comments.  He is an intelligent and successful man. He has 2 Masters degrees so he does not lack in any intelligence. \n\nWe have been dealing with this for years. I think my best option is to not contact her until she respects my simple request of cutting off the evil ex gf. My husband supports this 100%. I will never tell him to not talk to his mom. But he makes it clear to her that he will not condone her actions and he supports my detachment from her until the respect is mutual.", "That is how she treats him. She still acts like he is a child. She acts like he should follow every thing his parents say. If he goes against them in any way, it is ALWAYS  my fault.", "I don't think I expressed it correctly in my post. He didn't think she was toxic until the ex started messing with every relationship he had after their relationship.  She is a toxic person in general.  Even her own daughter has nothing to do with her as an adult.", "Thanks for the response. I do think I need to clarify how he supports me. He is extremely disgusted by how she acts. He has told me to not contact her anymore and he only talks to her about unimportant subjects anymore until she makes her priorities clear. He thinks she is the AH but I just wanted to make sure I was not influencing his opinion like MIL says I do.", "MIL and evil ex sound like a match made in heaven. Soulmates.", "I wouldn\u2019t even respond and just block her. Not saying anything says it all. \n\nPlus it drives people crazy. \n\nOnly tip I could give you: Maybe just don\u2019t interact with MIL anymore.. can\u2019t have a fight when you are not talking. \n\nYou are allowed to have boundaries when your MIL acts like this.", "That\u2019s great! Although is a difficult situation I think your husband reaction demonstrates that you are a happy couple that love and respect each other and that\u2019s so valuable. So happy for you about it! Of course I\u2019m sorry about your MIL attitude, but we can see the good part of this horrible situation too!", "Hubby should go LC as well.", "Gotcha lol that makes way more sense", "Alright, that's very good to know. You have a great husband, he's a keeper. Take care of yourselves, and don't let these AHs ruin what you have. \u2764", "That has been my approach to MIL for the last 3 weeks. No contact at all even though I used to talk with her 2 to 3 times per week. My husband has told her I will not resume conversation until the situation changes. I am hoping she will cut her out eventually.", "Good that you are doing this. I hope she will come to her senses.", "I think that this is smart. However, it is likely that your MIL is who she is and will not change. But cutting her out will likely give you some peace."]}
