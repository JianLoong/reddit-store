Every second weekend plus some extra days here and there my daughter goes to her dad's. In our household we are generally pretty busy and on the go but no matter what is going on we make the time to stop what we are doing and eat dinner together. This has been the Norm for us. \nI work later than my husband does and sometimes when he doesn't feel like making anything for dinner and it's been a long day he will ask me to pick up dinner on my way home from work which I have no problem with at all. I go pick something up and bring it home, we sit down and eat dinner together the three of us. \n\nYesterday My husband took my daughter out to get Christmas gifts and before they left he asked me if he should bring home dinner and I agreed and let him know that that sounds great. \nAfter about two hours of them being out shopping I had an idea that some ice cream for desert might be a fun addition to our dinner so called to ask my husband to grab some ice cream as well. When he answered the phone he informed me that he had taken my daughter to McDonald's and they had eaten dinner without me. \nI was shocked. And asked if he remembered that before leaving the house he had asked if he should bring home dinner and I had agreed that it would be great? He informed me that yes he remembered that and that he could still bring home something for me if I still wanted food but he said he was planning on eating out without me the whole time he just hadn't told me that. \n\nAm I the asshole for being upset by this situation?", "created_utc": 1703099606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18n2m4j/aita_for_getting_upset_when_my_husband_and_my/", "score": 1820, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Life is too short to fight about this.  He brought you home food.  My husband is my best friend and we do everything together.  We eat dinner together every day.  But you know what if he gets hungry while he is out, it is ok that he eats.  You took a very sweet and bonding moment and turned it negative.  Why should he even try then?

Yes, it's really nice that the three of you normally make time to sit down and have dinner together.  But any habit or household \"rule\" that becomes rigid is not a good thing.  So this day, your husband and daughter grabbed a quick meal together at McDonald's after Christmas shopping, because they were hungry.  Your husband was still going to bring you something to eat.  I do wonder why he neglected to tell you that the plan all along was that the 2 of them would eat on their own - could it be because you insist on sticking to \"we must always eat dinner together\" and it's a little much at times? \n\nI think you should focus on the fact that your husband and daughter apparently get along, which isn't always the case in a blended household.  You might also loosen up the dinner rule from time to time, and take your daughter out for dinner, just you two.  It's fun to have a change in the routine once in awhile.", "YTA\n\nBe thankful that he participates in the life of a child that isn't his!\n\nAre you envious of your own daughter?", "In the span of a lifetime OP, how important is one skipped dinner? He ate with your kid. You call her \"your kid\", does your husband not care about the child too? He carried her out to eat while they shopped, arguably we'd ALL LIKE to be fed while we shopped. If she was hungry, would you rather have her, a young child, starve while they wait for you to get home?\n\nHe ate with your kid. He fed your kid, made some good memories. \n\nSo how important is that one meal? He was willing to bring home food for you. YOU made a big deal about it.\n\nWill every missed dinner that happen lead you to spiral and pout and feel so so rejected? \n\nDo you think it was malicious? What is your fear? Part of parenting is not being so rigid with these rules you've created for your family. A tradition can change. Maybe a new, better tradition is to feed your kid when you go shopping and make some fun memories. \n\nYTA You were at work, he fed your kid and took her shopping.

That would be weird. \n\nA lot of users are saying about how hungry your kid was and they needed food immediately etc but he said this was always his plan so that doesn't really make sense.\n\nI do agree with the consensus this isn't a huge deal and you should let it go. But I think he was the bad communicator here not you and I do think he should apologize that you got let down even if he didn't mean for that to happen.", "YTA\n\nReally. You're pouting over a mcdonalds. Would you rather she stave untill she got home? Would you prefer your husband not feed her when she's hungry?\n\nHonestly this is a non issue and youre trying to make it one", "YTA you should be happy and appreciate you have a husband who wants to spend time and do things with your daughter.

I will probably be downvoted to oblivion, but NTA. \n\nYou stated that the norm in your household is for everyone to eat together, and that this is true even when you do carry out. In that case, it is not unreasonable for you to expect that when your husband offered to bring home dinner, the plan was for all of you to eat together. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about you being upset because your husband and daughter had dinner without you. You\u2019re not jealous that they had bonding time. You\u2019re upset because you were unexpectedly forced to eat dinner alone, and apparently your husband didn\u2019t even have the decency to clue you in until you asked. That sucks, and you have a right to be bummed out about it. Your husband is TA for not making his plan clear from the start.", "Bring you home food IF YOU WANT??? WTF? You already told him to bring home food, so that's rude. \n\nI'm going with NTA. I'd be upset too, but not enough to make a mountain out of.

If hubby had been upfront about taking daughter out for food, OP may have made different plans as well. Plus, when OP \"brings dinner\" she does so for the entire family, so it's only normal to think that's what husband meant too.\n\nI think husband and daughter found themselves snacky after shopping. Which is fine and understandable, but husband should have informed OP about the change and involved her in the process. \"Hey, we got really hungry so we're having dinner here. Do you still want me to bring you something from here, or would you prefer something else?\" would have gone a very long way. As it stands, hubby defending his carelessness by bending his promise to bring dinner as it suits him, is rude at best. OP is NTA", "I disagree with all the YTAs. He lied to you. He could have been upfront and honest, and the outcome would likely have been they eat out, bring you something home, and everyone's happy. Lying is lying.

He was enjoying time with your daughter. She probably saw the mcdonalds, got excited and asked him for some , like children do. He literally was going to bring you food home. I assumed based on the title that he took her to some fancy restaurant or a place you really wanted to go but youre literally jealous and  upset because they had an impromptu dinner at a fast food place. This is a weird thing to be so upset about.  Don't make big issues out of super small things or you may unintentionally damage their relationship they're trying to build by being unreasonable.", "this is something so small to be mad about and honestly you\u2019re being unreasonable because after a long day of shopping with your daughter, I\u2019m sure she was hungry and feeding her McDonald\u2019s without you is more important than letting her starve until they got home to eat with you especially since your husband was still planning on bringing you something home to eat. It wasn\u2019t like he was just going to McDonald\u2019s and eating and not bringing you anything home to eat which would\u2019ve been mean but he had every intention to bring you food, it is not a huge deal that they ate one meal without you, it won\u2019t kill you to eat by yourself one time. \n\nYou really need to pick your battles and I\u2019m sorry sis but this ain\u2019t one, you\u2019re the asshole.", "YTA\n\nThere is no problem with what he did.

He wasn't going to bring anything home for OP, he said he \"could\" do that \"if\" she was still hungry (?? obviously she would be ??) and that he never intended on eating at home with her at all. That's just rude. He doesn't have to eat every meal with his wife and it's likely their daughter was incredibly hungry, plans change no big deal. But that's not what happened.

The expectation set was that you 3 were to eat something together, and he agreed, but already had another plan. Why not just he honest? Weird behavior to do in my opinion.

Just not together.", "ESH\nI feel like it shouldn't be a big deal that they were out already and grabbed something. But I do feel it's a big deal that he was planning it all along and just hid it from you. Maybe he didn't realize how much it means to you to have that quality family time, but the deception is strange to me.", "Soft YTA\n\nHe had a daddy-daughter day.

A bit some spontaneityis great ! I react about the title, you say you're upset they don't have dinner with you. For once, it's not that important. The only reproach I could find is your husband didn't send you a message to explain they'll go to McDo a,d didn't ask you what you wanted them to bring you back. \n\nBut after all the reddit's post where children have bad stepdad, I'm so glad to read one is so great to his stepdaughter !!", "It\u2019s not that big of a deal.

Your husband could have text you to let you know plans changed and he could pick you up something.", "I don't know that you are an AH, but you are definitely being way too sensitive and blowing this way out of proportion. Whether it was miscommunication or if something caused the plans to change, what happened was really not a big deal. It is ok that you were disapointed that dinner played out differently.... but this is a very minor annoyance at best and definitely not worth causing a big issue over.", "I'm going with Gentle YTA.\nIt's great that he took your daughter out.  That sounds so much like the Daddy/daughter days I had with my dad growing up and I still cherish those memories at 41. YTA for being upset at this.  He was still going to bring you food.  Your daughter had a great time, was probably hungry as heck, and had dinner with someone who clearly cares for her.  Nothing at all to be mad at there.  \nI am always so thrilled and thankful when my partner does stuff with the kids.  I get a bit of a break and some quiet time.  Bonus if he brings me dinner as well! \nThank your husband for loving your child so much and apologize for being out of sorts.  Explain that you really enjoy having dinner together and just missed that.", "oh boy, YTA here. I could see being SLIGHTLY irritated that he changed plans and didn't tell you, but he spent time with your kid and fed her. This is objectively not a big deal. If a kid is hungry, you try to feed them. Missing one family dinner isn't the end of the world. Also, = I'm not a blended family expert, but it seems cool that step dad and step kid are out having a good time? Is something else going on that makes you stuck on this?", "YTA, what a weird thing to be upset about. Who cares if they grab dinner without you?", "YTA.

Every second weekend plus some extra days here and there my daughter goes to her dad's. In our household we are generally pretty busy and on the go but no matter what is going on we make the time to stop what we are doing and eat dinner together. This has been the Norm for us. \nI work later than my husband does and sometimes when he doesn't feel like making anything for dinner and it's been a long day he will ask me to pick up dinner on my way home from work which I have no problem with at all. I go pick something up and bring it home, we sit down and eat dinner together the three of us. \n\nYesterday My husband took my daughter out to get Christmas gifts and before they left he asked me if he should bring home dinner and I agreed and let him know that that sounds great. \nAfter about two hours of them being out shopping I had an idea that some ice cream for desert might be a fun addition to our dinner so called to ask my husband to grab some ice cream as well. When he answered the phone he informed me that he had taken my daughter to McDonald's and they had eaten dinner without me. \nI was shocked. And asked if he remembered that before leaving the house he had asked if he should bring home dinner and I had agreed that it would be great? He informed me that yes he remembered that and that he could still bring home something for me if I still wanted food but he said he was planning on eating out without me the whole time he just hadn't told me that. \n\nAm I the asshole for being upset by this situation?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "I\u2019m going to go ahead and say no one here is the asshole. \n\nYour husband fed your daughter when he should have, HOWEVER, he should have communicated better so you weren\u2019t waiting. I can understand why this would be annoying/upsetting. I would chalk it up to holiday stress and move forward. Unless this is repeated behavior, it\u2019s a small thing. This isn\u2019t the hill to die on.", "YTA. Hopefully you\u2019re not like this all the time.", "YTA", "YTA and a really weird one at that.

You make it appear as though no one in your home is allowed to eat dinner until YOU are ready to eat.

Is your family only allowed bread and water for dinner until your return?

He was deliberately being a jerk.", "I don't think it's about feeding the daughter - I think it's about the disrespect thar he's showing her to inconvenience her when she was expecting him to bring home dinner but also to just agree knowing all along that he had no intention of honoring it.

They were not out shopping \u201call day.\u201d They were out shopping for 2 hours at that point and the 2 hours included time to eat at McDonald\u2019s.\n\nIt\u2019s definitely a good thing that OP\u2019s daughter wants to spend time with her stepdad, but I think it\u2019s odd that he didn\u2019t say, \u201cI plan on taking stepdaughter to dinner just the two of us this time. Would you like us to bring home dinner for you?\u201d Why hide it and then admit that he intentionally didn\u2019t tell OP? Maybe he was afraid of her reaction, but regardless, they need to talk about why it\u2019s an obsession to have dinner together every night. As often as possible, absolutely yes. However, it\u2019s unreasonable to expect/require/demand it 100% of the time because that doesn\u2019t account for a child (or even an adult) needing to eat, rather than waiting for everyone to \u201cdrop what they\u2019re doing\u201d in order to eat together no matter what.

I ofc do not have children but I will never forget dating a man with an 8 year old daughter, we were on an outing which she was excited about but towards the end of the afternoon she became very tearful and whiny. Boyfriend was scolding her for her attitude and I said, let\u2019s get some food in her, I bet that will help, and guess what, it did.  It was maybe 3 or 4 in the afternoon, too early for \u201cadult\u201d dinner, but you do what you have to do, with kids. \n\nOP YTA why are you begrudging you husband and daughter eating without you? Frankly I think it\u2019s awesome your husband took your daughter out for a fun day of Christmas shopping, so what if they wound up at McDonald\u2019s? Can you not prepare food for yourself?

I\u2019m guessing from these comments a lot of you all don\u2019t have this experience so it\u2019s totally unimaginable and you can\u2019t relate making it seem as though OP is in the wrong when he\u2019s the jerk for lying and leading her on.", "It really does not sound like this is a common occurrence. It reads like they eat together often. This is a very overblown reaction. Missing the togethersness when its a rarity is weird to me.

Then instead stopped and ate dinner without at least telling me.\n\nMaybe OP was sitting around hungry for hours waiting to have family dinner. Also if I am eating with my husband there's a finite set of restaurants we both like.

He has no issue with getting her something from there before they leave or grabbing her something from somewhere else.

Perhaps it was a last minute decision and figured she wouldn\u2019t care , (as he would bring her food home anyways). Either way, he probably should have said something, but I don\u2019t think it was vindictive or intentional. There were just different assumptions that got lost in translation in regard to the outcome of these dinner plans.

No. Does she have a right to be upset because her asshole husband agreed to get something while out for the 3 of them to eat at home, set that expectation with her so she waits to eat, only to discover he lied and had another plan the entire time that left her out? Absolutely. He wasn't even planning on bringing her home anything from McDonald's. That's really shitty behavior.

But we do know he offered to bring her dinner, she got mad when she found out he meant just for her because they'd already eaten, and he still offered to bring her dinner. If he didn't end up bringing any (I haven't seen that or what other info was with it), that tells me she either didn't respond or said something like \"no its fine\". If she did submit a request, as he'd asked for, and he just decided to not get it, that would certainly be an asshole move, but probably an undstandable-ish one to try and make the point of \"hey maybe don't be an ass to the person making repeated efforts to bring you food\".

All she had to do was say \"oh I must have misunderstood, but yeah sure grab me [insert food], and please do grab that ice cream, it'd be nice to have some dessert together later.\" She would have been fed, not in a pointless argument over a now-past miscommunication that can't be retroactively rectified, and still get to have their daily family time when they eat dessert together.
