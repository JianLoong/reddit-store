We were both raised in a religious tradition that valued waiting until marriage, and we did. \n\nI\u2019ve learned something since and I\u2019m not sure how I feel about it. Two weeks before our wedding in 2018, my husband\u2019s aunt (Maria, now 39f), who is not religious at all (they are not \u201cblood\u201d related) took him out for dinner and drinks. I remember at the time thinking it was sort of sweet, since my husband and Maria are close, but kind of unusual. \n\nAnyway, what I\u2019ve learned is that Maria\u2019s purpose for taking him out was evidently to talk to him about sex and marriage, to give him a \u201creal\u201d point of view that she thought he hadn\u2019t learned (she was admittedly probably right about that). She gave him a sheet with her \u201ctop 10 things to remember in the bedroom\u201d written out. \n\nI found this sheet while doing some cleaning last week and was shocked. It was really specific and kind of graphic. A lot of the stuff was nice, like being confident, but some talked about really private and intimate stuff, too. And honestly I think he\u2019s put some of it to use with me. \n\nI asked my husband about it, and he blushed like crazy, and told me the back story I described above. I texted his aunt about something else last week and mentioned offhandedly that I had found the sheet, and she called me right away, asking if I wanted to talk about that.  I told her no, I wanted it to be a closed topic, and that I\u2019d appreciate her not bringing it up again. She seemed really put off and disappointed. \n\nAITA?

Talking openly about sex, intimate justice, and how to make it as safe and enjoyable as possible for both people involved, doesn\u2019t conflict with your religious traditions. Nothing about encouraging good sex within a marriage is encouraging premarital and extramarital dalliances. \n\nYou\u2019re just denying yourself better experiences in the bedroom. If your husband was pleasing you, sounds like you should thank his aunt. \n\nIf you have kids, please give them lots of sex ed early and often (and not abstinence-only). Studies show that more sex ed is actually correlated with people choosing to become sexually active later in life, for the right reasons, and with fewer teen pregnancies, with awareness of how to avoid STD\u2019s, and ability to please their partners that helps sustain strong and healthy marriages.", "YTA.   \n\n\nShe did you a tremendous favor.   \n\n\nMaria is a hero.", "Yeah, YTA. You brought up the sheet with the aunt for what purpose if you didn't want to discuss it with her? \"I'd appreciate you not bringing it up\"??? YOU brought it up. Sounds like you only brought the topic up to make some sort of point about it, did rhat point happen to be that you're better for not wanting to talk about sex? \n\nYou realize that virgins who never talk to anyone else about sex or look anything up privately or anything usually are really bad at sex, right? Most couples who marry virgins when neither couple have had any sex Ed don't \"figure it out\" on their own. The women just experiences really bad sex.", "I'm going to reserve judgment as to whether YTA or not. \n\nBut I will say that the more you can openly discuss with your husband the idea of sex, fantasies, likes, wants, dealbreakers, etc., the more intimate you and your husband can become. Good sex is about vulnerability. If you've got emotional walls up around sex, then that says you and your husband could be SO much closer!", "YTA. Religious doesn't mean pretending sex doesn't exist. Many families have similar traditions, especially in religious families. Sex is not in itself immoral in religion. Sounds like you may need to consider whether you want to live a prudish puritan lifestyle where sex is a dirty secret, or embrace that you are doing nothing wrong. You don't need to hide your sexuality as a married woman.", "I\u2019m going with soft YTA. But this largely depends on what exactly on the paper. Considering your religious background and her lack of religion, I\u2019m going to assume it was a more sex positive and how to have a better time. \n\nHis aunt seemed to want you two have a good sex life. Even a great one. You mention intimate acts, so I\u2019m guessing foreplay? If so, then count yourself lucky if your husband employed some of it. A lot of men, because they are idiots/selfish, don\u2019t do a whole lot of foreplay. \n\nSex can be a huge part of a relationship. It helps show intimacy and trust and love and I mean\u2026 it can just flat out feel great. \n\nOne thing you learn when you don\u2019t save yourself is that sex can also be really awful. This can be a strain on a relationship. If only one person is enjoying it, then that can make things strained and complicated and incredibly messy. Leading to resentfulness and\u2026 it\u2019s ugly.\n\nYour Aunt was trying to make sure that this wasn\u2019t going to happen to the both of you. That your sex life can be as enjoyable as possible. \n\nHonestly, so many young men could benefit from having an aunt pull them aside and have a conversation like this. \n\nBut also. \n\nIt was a closed topic? Your the one who opened it back up. She probably had forgotten about the whole thing until you brought it up.", "Sounds like she was trying to help since she isn\u2019t religious and she knew you both were raised around religion - which not only means abstinence, but probably meant little or no sexual education.\n\nI understand being uncomfortable, but it happened 5 years ago and as long as she isn\u2019t still checking in weekly to find out how last night went or update the sheet I would let it go. \n\nNAH", "NAH, but yes, you are being too uptight. A little bit of Sex Ed makes a HUGE difference in enjoying decent or good sex. \n\nWould it make a difference to you if your husband learned a few things from an uncle instead ?  What if he read The Joy of Sex ?  What if he got ideas from watching porn ?", "What's the conflict?", "The only assholes here are those who taught you that sex is something that\u2019s inherently shameful. It\u2019s not. You mentioned you were raised religious. It may be helpful to reframe your thinking (grain of salt, I\u2019m highly agnostic, take it as you will)- if humans are created in god\u2019s image, part of that image includes deriving pleasure from sex, in all its many forms. Seeing that pleasure as shameful, or sinful, would be denying a lovely gift, especially within a loving relationship. If we weren\u2019t designed to both give and receive those sensation, there would be little need to do more than procreate like fish. You\u2019re NTA, there\u2019s just a lot of erroneous thought processes to unlearn. Take joy in sex, and all it\u2019s messy, sweaty glory.", "Without knowing exactly what she shared I won't call her TA. I'm going with NAH. You're allowed to be uncomfortable, but you didn't share details so I don't know that she did anything untoward either. \n\nI'll be honest, I'm biased because I don't think anyone should have to learn about sex on the fly. I'm making an assumption here but I strongly suspect you and your husband were denied real sex education as a result of your upbringing. So, imo, good on your aunt for trying to give him ANY sort of guidance.", "YTA\n\nIf he applied some of those things with you and they felt good you maybe should even be thanking her \ud83d\ude02\n\nNevertheless the only person who can feel discomfort is your husband. If he felt his aunt ws innapropriate that's another story. If not, live and let live", "NAH\n\n> And honestly I think he\u2019s put some of it to use with me. \n\nAunt: \"YOU'RE WELCOME!\"", "NAH. I get why you feel uncomfortable, but TBH your aunt did you a favor. Most religious virgin guys are terrible at sex because they're taught nothing except that their orgasm is sex.\n\nIt's a pretty weird situation, but it's not a big deal.", "Nah. But you\u2019re definitely missing out. You\u2019re almost 30 and married. Exploring sex and enjoying it with your partner is totally okay. Talking about it is also okay.", "yes, yta in this situation for being judgemental about it. Talking about sex is not inherently graphic. it\u2019s not inherently sexual either\u2014i doubt she did anything more than explain things to him in a simple way.\n\n there\u2019s nothing wrong with being a virgin when you get married, but honestly the way that sex is treated as something inherently shameful and undiscussable is very wrong. ignorance around sex is massively dangerous. not only can it actually increase the odds that people engage in risky sex, it also contributes to patriarchal attitudes that lead to slut shaming and sexual assault. \n\nit sounds, quite frankly, like she sat him down and gave him a crash course on the basics of anatomy and explained to him that sex should feel good for both of you, and gave him some suggestions on how to achieve that. That. is. a. good. thing. literally everyone SHOULD be taught that before they have sex. \n\nsex is basically a complicated physical exercise. generally speaking, we think it\u2019s totally normal for all other exercises to have a knowledgeable person explain \u201chey, stretch and warm up muscles using a technique like this before you do this strenuous activity, and when you do the activity, work towards these goals.\u201d it\u2019s literally the same thing.", "NAH.  I think you were raised in a culture where sex was just not talked about and your aunt is more... frank.  I think she meant well and was probably worried that your husband's knowledge of even the nuts and bolts mechanics was lacking.  And that may be valid... no sex ed I got was centered around pleasure, and sex SHOULD be a pleasurable part of life.  A lot of women just new to sex put up with sex that's just not great because partner doesn't know enough about even basic anatomy to be sensitive in bed.  Information is good!  If you have kids, I encourage you to be a lot more open about these things... you don't have to buy them the Kama Sutra but you should absolutely be calling things by their proper name without blushing, answering any questions in a straightforward way, and talking about things like consent.  Consider this an opportunity to explore your feelings and get more comfortable talking about sex!", "YTA he prob needed some real info and guidance and your sex life prob would have been miserable without her help. She\u2019s doing the work his parents should have.", "NAH. It sounds like your husband was alright with having this kind of conversation with his aunt. It\u2019s fine for you not to be comfortable having a similar conversation with her yourself. \n\nI would however suggest both you and your husband consider doing some reading both separately and together. There are a lot of helpful books out there that cover everything from basic biology, to technique, to communication within relationships. The Joy of Sex by Alex Comfort, and She Comes First by Ian Kerner are both good places to start. The Vagina Bible by Jen Gunter is also also a helpful read for anatomy and health questions.", "NAH as long as you don't let it negatively affect your relationships. Sounds like she did you a favour!", "It can be wonderful exploring sex as virgins, but you sound like you\u2019re embarrassed by people knowing you do it. To be clear, sex isn\u2019t dirty, it\u2019s nothing to be ashamed about, and it\u2019s perfectly fine and normal to want to know more. Your husband\u2019s aunt was doing what parents normally do when discussing sex and answering their children\u2019s questions. How about going to the library for some books to learn what you could be doing, or ordering something on line?", ">Am I being uptight?\n\nYes.\n\nBut so what? You play the hand you're dealt. NAH.", "NAH.\n\nYes, you\u2019re being uptight by being \u201cshocked\u201d by this. But you haven\u2019t done anything to be the AH, as long as you just go about your life.", "No one should be upset. No one is ahole.  She was trying to help.  No one thinks like you.  You in the ubiquitous sense. No one.  Each person has their own + and - in terms of development because most  parents are not good\u2014Average or below average at best at preparing their kids for adult world .  If you think you might be the ahole just drop her alone saying sorry. Forget about it. That was yesterday. \n\nLove, compassion, joy, sharing, listening ( and hearing) being in the present are all high vibrating. \nFear,Hate, resentment, jealousy, anger, greed are all low vibrating.\nChoose.  You were literally born to make this choice. Especially on the era of great changes coming. Choosing wisely reflects love of self. When that happens a whole world of love, confidence , and good fortune opens up.", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with not wanting to talk to this woman about sex. But it would be a good idea if you and your husband would get comfortable talking about it to each other.", "NTA but very uptight.\n\nI understand that it might be unusual for you and I totally understand that you don't want to talk to her about your sex life as she's not even your relative. But you should be thanking her as dealing with a 25yo virgin who never been with a woman could be not very fun. She essentially gave him the talk that his parents were supposed to give him but there's no more devastating curse than having religious zealots for parents.", "You shouldn\u2019t be made to feel wrong that you\u2019re uncomfortable with it. It\u2019s okay to be uncomfortable. There\u2019s nothing wrong with you. People who grow up in very religious communities often don\u2019t feel comfortable and therefore stumble around a lot. I think that his aunt was trying to look out for both of you, and is probably worried about how you feel.", "You sound like such a good person while im reading it, so I'm not going to answer the question with if your are or not.\n\nThis reminds me of the first American Pie movie where I think you'd have been 10 (lol) where the brother has a full blown book of how to please a woman...\n\nHarmless fun..Enjoy your marriage...xx", "I\u2019m not going to pile on. You really seem open to accepting your judgement as TA and have turned a corner and I just want to say it\u2019s cool of you.", "NAH, you\u2019re not being an AH from what you described but you\u2019re definitely being uptight. You were raised to be uptight about sex so it\u2019s a hard habit to break. But talking openly about sex and what you like and dislike will make your sex life with your partner infinitely better.\n\nHonestly, if this aunt is willing to talk to in a judgement free way might be really helpful and even liberating for you.", "NAH. At the same time, because you are in this religion and seem to not know much about sex outside of your religion, I want to say this. When women leave religions that have similar views on sex, they share some horrible stories. Husbands who know nothing of consent but believe the act is their God given right and force their wives, that women\u2019s orgasms are sinful, that masturbation is sinful, that women should be willing all the time, etc. \n\nIt is a little weird on the surface for this to come from his aunt. I understand that. But she really did you both a favor and seems to be offering to listen/advise so the two of you don\u2019t have those issues. These are the kinds of topics many women discuss with their friends. Good luck! My husband and I have been together for 17.5 years and it keeps getting better. Good communication is so important!", "Am I the only one who wants to know what was on the sheet of paper???  Sounds like it was good advice!  OP, would you be comfortable sharing any part (or whole) of it?", "NTA. To take adult people (who have been adult for a while) out for \u00absex ed\u00bb is a very weird thing to do. You are adult people who can Google or ask if you want advice. It is something very condecending about the aunt feeling she should be teaching him this. He was a virgin. Not an idiot. \n\nThis is a very personal subject anyways, so someones rules/advice is not really that useful. Don\u2019y understand why your husband didn\u2019t just shred the list and dismissed her advice though. That is almost more crazy to me. They needed to be two to have this conversation about your sex life.", "Uptite", "YTA for bringing it up if you didn't want to talk about it. It's like opening the door in front of someone then abruptly slamming it shut.  It's just random and rude when it didn't sound like she ever brought it up sense.\n\nAlso let's be real. Religious groups are uptight and are notoriously bad at sex education. The amount of times you hear a story from some clueless guy who doesn't even know how pregnancy works is insane.  She was looking out for both of you and it seems like your husband was very grateful if he still has the paper around and remembers it.\n\nIt might be weird and unorthodox but if you were that religious he probably didn't know much at all and needed the help from someone trusted and trying to explain it to him.", "I can\u2019t help but feel like someone so religious would even have a Reddit account, never mind posting it on this sub\u2026but YTA, she did something nice for YOUR enjoyment", "I'm going with NTA. Your husband is the AH for not telling you about it. It would have creeped me out to find something like that and I would have wondered who else was in on what we were doing. I don't think it's about pleasure. It's about privacy, and if you want privacy there's nothing wrong with that. It doesn't make you a prude. I don't think I would have called the aunt about it because as my dear pappy used to say, the more you stir shit the worse it smells.  If you don't want to discuss sex with anyone, you don't have to, and there are plenty of way to educate yourself privately.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It sounds like your aunt was trying to make sure her nephew got a better understanding about women, and her first hand information is probably more reliable and contextual than a Google search. If your husband was fine with it, then it\u2019s not much different from parents giving their kids The Talk. \n\nAt the same time, you\u2019re also valid for feeling uncomfortable with it. I would feel the same way too. Culturally, these kinds of talks are between members of the same gender for my culture, (dad or uncles giving these talks to the boys, mum or aunts giving these talks to the girls.) so I can see why you would feel uncomfortable with it too.", "YTA, based on your shielded up bringing, Maria was trying to make sure you are being cared for and sexually fulfilled as well. Most women (in my opinion) never orgasm with their partner. You deserve to have orgasms and to be gratified sexually.

But yes this does come off a bit repressed and sheltered", "YTA. Only saying that you get my vote in, but it doesn't sound like you unnecessarily escalated a situation, just calmly expressed that you didn't want her to do that again; Having said that, you are being uptight and I think what she did could be very helpful to your relationship.

It sounds like his Aunt was the only one who recognised that having no sex education, awareness and even acknowledgment is an unhealthy way to live a human life. To leave your child unprepared about the intimacy that sex contains, not to mention the pleasures it entails, is a cruel way to raise someone. It is our nature and to be denied knowledge or guidance on a natural aspect of living is just wrong. I\u2019m sorry your parents did that to you and honestly, I wished you had an Aunt that advocated for your sexual rights like he had. Instead of thinking about the subject, call her to thank her for caring about him and you. Without her guidance, you and your husbands sex life would be completely different and maybe not for the better. She did good. Her guidance came from a place of love and it should be acknowledged as such. \n\nI don\u2019t think you are an AH. You are just coming from a place where you were taught sex is bad. Uptight? Yes.

Being new / uncomfortable to the kind of topic is understandable, talking about it generally is a-ok but obviously your allowed to draw the line at personal experiences to others / without permission. Best of luck navigating this new world, stay plenty hydrated.\n\nAlso, for many, many many reasons you should be informed about sex , as awkward of a topic as it is being safe is incredibly important.", "Yes you are.

She was trying to help him be a better partner for you. \n\nAlthough we have our own (obvious) opinions about sex and marriage, we have made it a point to provide our kids with age appropriate sex education. Obviously we wish they would wait. But we make sure they know what it is, the risks involved, and how to protect themselves. We make sure they have access to condoms because we realize we are not the norm. I read a stat that even in Christian circles, something like 94% of people have sex out of wedlock. We want our kids to make informed decisions about their bodies and have the tools to keep themselves safe. We also want to make sure that we don\u2019t make them feel like their bodies or sexuality are dirty or shameful just because they make different choices than we did.\n\nSo yeah, I would be weirded out if I found out his aunt had done something similar.

At least she didn't deny anything to you and offered you the chance to discuss it. You obviously feel some type of way and want to talk about. Perhaps you should consider it.

It's almost a form of abuse in my view, not as bad as forcing a cliterodectomy on a young girl, but culturally mandated ignorance is emotional manipulation and completely unnecessary.

More than one thing can be true at once, and sex is very personal. It's still really valuable to get some education ahead of time, but it can be awkward or uncomfortable.", "You still seem unsure.", "I\u2019m dying to know how they were doing it??", "You have a link for this?

How are you ever supposed to know what is normal, what isn't, and what might need a doctor.\n\nI'm always shocked at the amount of women I know who weren't taught to pee after sex (to prevent bacteria forced up the urethra from causing infection). \n\nYou've both had very limited exposure to sex, so how are you supposed to figure out what each of you likes? There are so many things to know and try!", "Do you want to have a satisfying relationship in the bedroom with one of the most fantastic & connecting aspects of a relationship or something that fizzles out in a few years spurred on by a fear of divorce from religious ideology. Whether or not people want to admit it, unless both parties are asexual then sex is a big part of the relationship. It\u2019s okay to talk about it, & it sounds like the things they were talking about were so that you didn\u2019t have a 30 year old as experienced as a first timer.

In order to choose abstinence, the other choices must be taught as well. And without knowing about the other choices, people can\u2019t make the smart decisions when they do decide to have sex.

The whole AITA caboodle and then say. I think we...should talk about sex. Our sex. Then just go from there. Sre what he thinks about opening a dialogue. He's your partner. Just say, you still feel a lot of shame around sex and you would like to shed the shame so that you and he can connect more and you can actually let loose, explore, and enjoy each other. Then ask him if there's anything he's wanted to bring to the bedroom. But was afraid to introduce and then just go from there. Take it slow,  but be open minded.  Also, make friends that aren't scared to talk about sex. It is okay to talk about it. It's how we learn.
