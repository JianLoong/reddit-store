I understand your friends not wanting to spend a whole week long (!) trip with someone they barely know. You should have given them more time to get to know each other. You shouldn\u2019t have forced the girl you just start dating on them. You created an uncomfortable situation for everybody, especially Lily.", "YTA.  People have a right to choose who they associate with and your friends explained their feelings when you first asked them. That should have been the end of it. Instead, you tried to force Lily into a situation where she wasn't wanted which was, at best, thoughtless.", "YTA, I get that it was well-intentioned but you've only been dating her for 3 months and that's a little soon to be foisting your new partner onto your friends' already planned trip that predates the relationship.\n\nIt seems that Lily wouldn't have been bothered to sit things out, so why did you insist on dying on this hill?", ">I thought it would be nice to bring her along on the trip to get to know my friends better\n\ngetting to know them should be done over dinner, or a concert, or other minor outings.

Live without gf for a week.\n\nAwful. You failed everyone.", "YTA\n\nIF they don't know her, this is a terrible way to get that relationship started. Putting them in a situation where they really can't get away if they don't hit it off is a bad idea. Baby steps.", "YTA - no dude. Your brand new girlfriend has no place on a friend trip.", "YTA. A trip where you're forced to be together most of the time is not a good way for them to get to know your girlfriend. It would have been better to go out to dinner first instead. You knew they didn't want to, but you harassed them into agreeing. Now you've ruined the trip for everyone because you demanded that everything be according to how you wanted it. You're selfish.", "You're not stuck in the middle. You're on one side and everyone else disagrees with you, including your girlfriend btw. How can you not understand that YTA?", "YTA. You have dated this person for 3 months. You barely know her but you want to bring her on an already planned vacation. That\u2019s crazy. If I were your friends I wouldn\u2019t want her their either!

You may have lost your friends as well.", "YTA.  She wasn't part of the original plans. Now suddenly, you're dating her...but not for very long at all...and you want to add her to their vacation?

This isn't how you accomplish that.", "ESH (except for Lily)\n\nOP - you bullied your \u201cfriends\u201d into including Lily on this trip.  It\u2019s very different traveling with friends than traveling with someone who your friends don\u2019t know too well.

However, they were AH\u2019s when they chose to specifically exclude her from most of the activities on the trip.  Lilly didn\u2019t do anything to them.  \n\nUnfortunately, OP, you have created unnecessary conflict in both your friendship with Sarah & Mike and your relationship with Lily.  Even after this issue gets resolved, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Sarah & Mike treat Lily negatively - as well as blame her for this conflict (as if she was pressuring you to have her be included on this trip).\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to want Lily to be included and to have asked.  However, when your friends said \u201cno\u201d, you should have respected that.

Now you\u2019ve upset your friends and put Lily on awkward ground with them.\n\nYour friends should not have conceded to her coming and then made arrangements to exclude her; that\u2019s horrible. While you screwed up here by not accepting their \u201cno\u201d out of the gate your request isn\u2019t unusual. Their Mean Girls actions are immature and nasty. I\u2019d rethink their presence in your life; I wouldn\u2019t stand for my friends to be petty about my SO.\n\nPoor Lily. I\u2019m sure she feels like they view her as a wedge peeling you away from them and it\u2019s all been you so far. This is going to make their first real hangout -if that\u2019s even on the table now- very awkward.", "I\u2019m going to disagree with what seems to be the consensus.  I think NTA.  If it is a trip that is for fun, why would they be like this? \nFun times and making memories shouldn\u2019t be hoarded by the few.  A group can grow and expand and still have fun with even more memories.", "Nta. Do something with your girl that weekend instead", "If I were Lily, I would thank you. \n\nYou may only be dating 3 months but obviously you think highly enough about her that you want to introduce her to your friends and start including her in your life.

AH.", "Lord you are a foolish AH you picked all the wrong dialogue choices and got the worst ending", "YTA being forced on a trip is not how you sought to know someone.

They didn\u2019t want to spend a week with a stranger. Nobody said they didn\u2019t want to meet her over diner, as normal people would do.", "... 3 months is 12 weeks. If they've been dating for 3 months, how could he have met her 9 weeks ago? And do people usually start dating right when they meet? So maybe add another couple weeks on top of the 12.\n\nNot to say he should have added her to the trip. That was for sure the wrong move lol", "I assume OP is telling a one sided version of this story", "Oh absolutely lol"]}
