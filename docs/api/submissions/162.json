Don't sugar coat crap and lay into him hard he obviously needs a wake-up call. \n\nI just have to chuckle a bit that they want a 17 yr old to be a \"flower girl\" they want basically an adult to be a flower girl. Do they even make \"flower girl\" dresses that big?? If there's no one to be a \"flower girl\" don't have one because that'd just look ridiculous.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
