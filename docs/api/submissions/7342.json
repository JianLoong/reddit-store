My gf said since a hotel/airbnb costs way more than her plane ticket, she will pay for the hotel/airbnb this time and I can pay for her plane ticket. I was grateful and after she picked out a nice resort for us to stay at, I bought her a ticket.\n\nCue arguing. She's upset because the plane ticket I bought has a layover. She's mad because she's going to, in her own words, \"be stuck in an airport/plane for like 12 hours\" because I cheaped out and didn't buy her a direct flight. She also said that I know she's terrified of planes and now I'm making her take four of them instead of two (round-trip) so she doesn't even want the ticket anymore and will just cancel the trip entirely or buy her own ticket.\n\nI'm at a loss for words, I didn't know she would act this entitled.

She should just cancel the trip and save herself the money and headache.", "YTA - Time is worth something and 12 hours is a long time. Was what you saved worth her sitting around for all that time? Why not just split the cost of both the plane and AirBnB? She picks the ticket and you both trade off choosing the place to stay or something like that.", "YTA.

Not only is she paying for the more expensive half so that you can go away together, but you\u2019ve called her ENTITLED for it whilst ALSO ignoring that she hates layovers, a fact she\u2019s made very clear?\n\nIf my boyfriend did this *without even discussing it with me* when I was paying for accommodation, I definitely wouldn\u2019t want to go, not least because I\u2019d be rethinking the relationship.", "YTA, it's a $100 difference, you are a cheapskate. She is not acting entitled, you are acting disrespectful of her time. Cancel that ticket and fork out for a direct flight, to make up for your lousy move, I'd say make it business class!", "YTA. She got a nice resort for you both, and you cheaped out on the plane ticket with no thought of her comfort.\n\nEdit to add: OP, please add to the original post saying the 3.5 hr direct flight was $100 more.

Especially when someone is a nervous flyer!\n\nIf you have to include a layover, always check with the person you are buying a ticket for first. We recently had a direct flight changed to include a layover and even though I was 95% sure my husband would be fine with it, I still checked with him as he\u2019s a very nervous flyer.\n\nETA: After seeing how little the cost difference is ($100?!? WTF dude), you are even more TA then I thought. My mother is the queen of finding travel savings and she would even say YTA and just pay the damn $100. And this would be from a woman who once drove 4 hours to another airport for a flight. But that saved my parents almost $2,000 on ticket costs so at least it was justifiable.", "YTA. So you know she hates layovers. Know she hates flying. Know shes paying for the way more expensive portion of the trip, but go ahead and book a 5 hour layover for her without so much as a phone call? This isn\u2019t entitled, I\u2019d be pissed too. If you really couldn\u2019t afford whatever the price difference was then at least call her and maybe she pays the difference. And a 5 hour layover? My dude, a layover shouldn\u2019t be longer than most domestic flights. \n\nAll I know is that regardless of her reaction if you\u2019re so hard up for money right now that you\u2019re willing to save money by inconveniencing the person treating you to the majority of you trip, you\u2019re going to have a miserable vacation.

You're basically telling her she isn't worth the money if you can do it on the cheap.\n\nYou should have discussed this with her first before you bought them. And since this is a cheaper flight. I assume they are non-refundable.  I understand money can be tight.  But this was not a good move on your part.", "YTA.  She told you she hates layovers many times before and you decided to buy layovers ticket?", "Yta, layovers suck so bad. If there was an option without one, you should chosen it.

Nonstop flights can be astronomically more expensive, especially during peak travel time. \n\nI am going on a limb to guess which airline it is and I will say that you can purchase a one-time pass per itinerary day for around $60 each. This will give her access to the airlines first class lounge in terminal B where she can enjoy complimentary cocktails, beer and wine, coffee, tea, soft drinks, infused waters and other non alcoholic beverages, complimentary refreshments including a fresh and healthy spread of salads, sandwiches, soups, crudites, charcuterie, fresh fruit, premium cheeses, bread, crackers, desserts etc. The lounge is quiet, free from house announcements, usually with a great view of the airport, free wifi, private work spaces, private restrooms, complimentary magazines and newspapers, and comfortable lounge seating free from the bustle of the airport. \n\nIt's cheaper than upgrading to a non stop but it will make her layover less stressful.", "Reading is hard ...", "So you think she should pay for her own ticket on top of the hotel/airbnb?", "OP replied and I updated.

I guess if he has no money left to do anything after that, by the logic you\u2019ve presented, he would be an a-hole then too because then she would probably get mad at him too for that.\n\nThis leaves him at a no-win situation.

She explicitly paid for the accommodation for this time, in order to cover the more expensive part of the trip.\n\nWe obviously can't know the exact situation here, financially-speaking, but I haven't heard enough (from the OP) to be able to understand why shafting his GF's time and making the travel into a crappy experience for her would be worth the trade-off.\n\nConsider this: he chose to spend an extra 16h of her time (on travel) to save $100... that's time he could have spent with her (priceless, hopefully), or which she could have spent working potentially (for more than $100, probably).

Of course he didn't put those damning details in the post.", "Exactly. I totally agree with you. It sounds like communication was lacking on both sides and it wasn\u2019t specifically just his fault. The only thing he really mentioned that swayed me more in his favor was that he is struggling financially and all she told him was that he was responsible for paying for her ticket, so it makes sense that he, of course, would go for the most affordable option because he only has a limited amount of money.\n\nThanks for sharing your insight. You\u2019re very right.", "Alright I see now. Changing to YTA. The way the post was worded was that it was a few hundred dollar difference.

It will probably end up costing the same but your girlfriend will be unhappy.", "Makes sense. I'm saying NTA. You wanted to be able to afford fun things on the trip so it makes sense you'd need to opt for a lower cost flight to accomplish that. I think you should make that clear with her so she understands that.", "I appreciate your opinion, but he didn\u2019t state exactly how much money he has to his name, so I am viewing this from the position of someone who knows what it\u2019s like to financially struggle. Just because someone says they have enough money to afford something doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s feasible and there are other things financially that a person has to take into account.\n\nI\u2019m also certain that if he paid for the more expensive ticket and if this by chance left him very low on money to where he couldn\u2019t pay for anything else (i.e. activities, restaurants, etc) this would actually also be unfair to *her*. She shouldn\u2019t have to pay for everything. They should both feel safe knowing they are both equally contributing to this. \n\nNeither should feel like things are unfairly divided, so I think the solution to this would be for them to sit down and communicate about this so they can understand each other including what they\u2019re both working with and what they can both realistically contribute.", "Yes, you\u2019re right. What he actually should have done is told her she\u2019s SOL and shouldn\u2019t worry about booking any accommodations because he can\u2019t afford to treat her like the princess she wants to be treated as right now. \n\nPlane tickets aren\u2019t cheap, and when you\u2019re working with a limited amount of money and still want to be able to afford paying for activities for a trip, you have to look at all costs. Realistically, the price of the ticket isn\u2019t the price of everything that was planned. \n\nOP should just cancel the entire thing because it\u2019s becoming an issue where his girlfriend is only focused on the type of ticket she got that she didn\u2019t want and isn\u2019t happy that he did what she asked him to, so at this points, the plans they made should now just be discarded in lieu of trying again another year.", "Yes, I agree that it should have been discussed, and maybe there\u2019s a reason that he had to deviate from the agreement, but the problem is from his story that it doesn\u2019t sound like they discussed the exact price of any tickets. She didn\u2019t communicate to even tell him specifically what ticket she wanted.\n\nIt appears that it was only discussed that he would be paying for the ticket since it would be more affordable for him. You can\u2019t blame him for not buying a ticket without a layover if you don\u2019t know his finances and don\u2019t know what he could actually afford. Not to mention, it doesn\u2019t sound like she gave him a price range. It looks more like she just told him it was his responsibility to pay for her ticket which is very vague and wouldn\u2019t tell him that he was specifically bound to a certain price range. He likely did what he could afford which is why he mentioned his financial difficulties.", "I usually spend at least $50 at the bar or restaurant on a significant layover in an airport, so while he\u2019s saving $100 she\u2019s going to likely spend even more.", "Okay that's a good point. I missed that comment. He is getting into AH territory then. My point about lack of communication stands though. But to be fair, $100 can be a huge difference to some people. We don't know what kind of budget that he has or exactly what he means by financial problems", "It\u2019s free to communicate, yes, but the only problem with your logic is that a budget was never discussed which was also her fault too. It takes two people to communicate. When neither person does, the fault doesn\u2019t fall on one person.\n\nIn my opinion, he should just cancel the plans entirely and maybe save up money on the side to fund a trip for Valentine\u2019s Day next year. If he does that, he will be able to ensure he has enough money to afford whatever she wants by that time since that\u2019s apparently more important to her than her breaking the bank and putting her boyfriend in the hole over the price of a plane ticket.\n\nSometimes you have to be happy with what you get, and the girlfriend\u2019s reaction is an example of someone who is being unreasonable and not considering their SO\u2019s financial situation.", "Then yes, as I stated somewhere else in a different comment, maybe they should have cancelled the plans altogether and should have tried again at a better time.", ">You didn't save money, you just shifted who is paying.\n\nHadn't even considered *her* extra costs during the travel until this comment.\n\nYeesh, I thought it was bad enough she was paying an extra 16h of her time!", "He\u2019s adding a total of 16 hours of extra travel time for her, to save $100.

She's not acting like a princess. They both want this trip. They choose not to split prices 50/50 because they don't want to \"owe\" each other however briefly. (Which I think is insane, but ok.) She *offered to pay the bigger item*. \n\nAnd your read is that she's a spoiled princess?? You've got some weird misogyny you need to work through on this because you're not making any sense.", "He know she was scared of planes though and that she\u2019s never done layovers before, so it seems reasonable she\u2019d expect the same kind of flight she normally gets, and that her partner would understand why she doesn\u2019t do layovers. And seriously making someone travel for 12 hours instead of 3.5 over $100 is ridiculous. He wasn\u2019t doing her a favor but getting a ticket, she was doing him a favor by paying for more than half. Also, he says above that he could afford the ticket, he just wanted to save some money because he doesn\u2019t have \u201ca ton\u201d. He really screwed her over on this.", "This is it!!\n\nWinner Winner Chicken-dinner", "If $100 is a huge difference, he should have just said he can't afford the trip.

He stated he doesn\u2019t have a ton of money- so by your logic, he should further deplete his finances and have nothing left to live off of or to even be able to have enough to fund activities for their trip.\n\nThat\u2019s really unfair to someone to expect more than what they can do when they are only working with a limited amount of money and don\u2019t want to put themselves in the hole. You have to factor in the entire trip to judge the situation logically- not just the costs of a plane ticket.\n\nIf he couldn\u2019t afford a higher priced ticket, maybe he should have just backed out altogether and should have told her maybe next year. I\u2019m sure that would have *totally* made her happy.", "Um? Throwing around terms like \"princess\" because a woman is upset that her boyfriend disregarded her phobias and her comfort is misogynistic.

Also, have you never heard women say they want to be treated like a princess? There\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting to be treated in a special way by their SO regardless of gender. There\u2019s also nothing wrong with saying you want to be treated like a prince or princess by your SO because it\u2019s okay to feel that way. I\u2019ve also heard plenty of guys say their SOs treat them like a king. It doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re devaluing their SO.

He says he doesn\u2019t have a whole lot to work with. You can\u2019t expect him to put himself in the negative in his bank account just because she is throwing a fit about the flight not being what she wanted.\n\nBut what I do agree with you on is that he should have just told her he couldn\u2019t have done it. In my opinion, he should just take it upon himself to tell her he wants to cancel plans entirely because he\u2019s only working with a certain amount of money. By the time he bought her the more expensive plane ticket, it\u2019s possible he couldn\u2019t afford to pay for anything else, so she\u2019d be SOL if he couldn\u2019t pay for anything else, so why even bother planning anything in the first place?

It sounds like he can afford the trip and won\u2019t go \u201cinto the negative\u201d, but instead will be left with $100 extra in his budget, at the cost of her time and comfort.

YTA. A huge AH. She\u2019s not \u201centitled\u201d; she\u2019s rightfully pissed off at you for stranding her in an airport for a half a day.", "YTA\n\nShe typically flies to you. You therefore know how long it takes her - she almost certainly messages with you before she has to turn the phone off. \n\nYou know that the additional 4-5 hours is NOT the normal travel time for her. And you know she hates the layovers. \n\nShe decided the cost of the accommodations is more than the cost of her NORMAL flight plan. She let you purchase the flight since it was still cheaper. She wasn\u2019t saying \u201cwaste an entire day of mine to pay the cheapest you can\u201d.  \n\nShe expected to take her normal flight plan. \n\nI\u2019d be cancelling too. It seems like it\u2019s always her coming to you - this means it HER always giving up multiple extra hours of her time to come to you. \n\nYou\u2019re an asshole.", "I was going to say NAH, I get both sides, but then you drop the bomb in the comments that the direct flight is 8.5 hours less travel time and was only $100 more. I take layovers all the time, but that's to save $300+. It sounds like you simply picked the cheapest flight without any thoughts of whether it was the best deal. Hard for me to not also wonder if this flight is on Spirit while the direct was on a major carrier. If $100 is going to break the bank, you honestly shouldn't be taking this trip.\n\nYTA.", "_\"I'm at a loss for words, I didn't know she would act this entitled.\"_\n\nAgreed. The GF paid for the more expensive accomodations. She is also afraid of flying yet makes her way to OP instead of the other way around. OP also knew about her discomfort with flying, yet he things his GF is being \"entitled\" for not wanting a more inconvenient and mentally + physically exhausting travel experience..... I travel often and layovers are **not** fun.", "Oof. I was gonna say he\u2019s not the ass, but I assumed the tickets would be like twice as expensive. Work an extra couple of hours at work to save your loved one hours of time spent in a situation they hate.", "Ive never seen a post where such entitled people so proudly proclaim their demands lololol. If money is tight there is no excuse to take more expensive options. Second, there was no reason for him to book her flight, idk why anyone would ever have someone else book their flight. Has this couple never heard of Venmo?", "\ud83e\udd23\n\nYeah, OP, YTA, obviously. You need to ask yourself something: why do you care so little about your girlfriend\u2019s comfort?", "I like to value my time based on my hourly rate. Like, when debating purchasing something, I\u2019ll say \u201cis this worth X hours of my life?\u201d based on my salary. And when it comes to things being more expensive but saving me time, it makes the calculation easier. Like, \u201cthis costs $X for me to cut 5 hours off my flight. Since I\u2019d make $X in that time, it is/isn\u2019t worth it.\u201d\n\nOP effectively stated his gf\u2019s time is worth $5.88/hr, assuming that both the departing and return flights could have been 3.5 hours each but are now 12hrs each due to layovers.", "He outright states he's having financial difficulties. On the topic of rice and beans, the price of a ticket could make or break the bank for someone who is struggling financially. He clearly demonstrates he is generous whenever he has the means to be. Ever been so utterly strapped that $100 is the difference between being able to afford your electric bill that month? \n\nThat was how I spent my twenties, and I had friends scoff or sulk when I couldn't afford trips with them because they literally could not grasp what it's like to stand at the cashier, sweating as they announce the total, because your funds aren't sufficient. $100 can be couch pennies to you. That's not the reality for a lot of hardworking people. And his girlfriend and this comment section reeks of entitlement, I'm kind of shocked actually.", "Really? You\u2019ve never had a first leg delayed to the point you miss your flight with a 1hr layover? I fly 2-3 weekends per month. I always give myself a small buffer in case of any delays to the first flight. 2-3 hours is reasonable imo. 5+ hours too much time.  It\u2019s literally saved my ass from being stuck in an airport overnight.", "What reddituserno27 said.  OP said the direct flight was 3.5 hours each way. While the one he booked is 12hrs each way. So really an extra 19hrs of travel time. \n\nThe largest airport in my state has very few direct flights and even with layovers I can get pretty much anywhere in the US under 8hrs, assuming no delays. 12hrs is nuts.", "I had an 8 hour layover once. It was a business trip I got notified about pretty late and it was genuinely the best way to get to where I was going, but it meant I was stuck in London Heathrow for EIGHT HOURS.\n\nI paid for a lounge and spent six of my hours curled in a big chair with an electrical outlet and free snacks. I actually napped in my chair for a bit, which I would not have been comfortable enough to do outside the lounge either physically or mentally. It was like $65 or something outrageous but I don't even care, it was worth it.", "Definitely worth it!", "Loool so you just forget how to use your words and don\u2019t actually discuss it with your partner?\n\nMaybe save being a contrarian for when you actually have a point and you\u2019re not reaching desperately to excuse shitty behaviour so you can feel diFFerEnT aNd sPeCIal?", "He\u2019s doubled her travel time\ud83d\ude2d", "I would never let someone else choose or buy a ticket for me. If OP did so without her even knowing he was going to choose her flight, then he's the AH. That is not stated in the post. But yes, \"demanding\" direct flights is Uber entitled lol. Dude did not go out of his way to be mean or anything like that.", "So, you\u2019re saying you literally just didn\u2019t read the post properly\u2026?", "Yeah I have always purchased direct if it's possible.", "In the morning, after my 4 hours of sleep, I was trudging down the hallway with my bag and I smelled gas coming from the laundry room.  I told the desk clerk, and she called the maintenance guy, and he said that it didn't matter because the dryers had been converted to electric last month.  It was 5 in the morning and I couldn't gather up enough tact to be polite and I said \"Look lady, I'm leaving in three minutes, but you're staying here.  If the place blows up, it isn't going to be ME they're picking up in pieces.  You need to call the gas company.\"  I could see my point finally register, and she called the gas company.  I never heard of the hotel with the longest hallway east of the Mississippi blowing up, so I guess she got the gas company there before it all exploded.", "Not agreeing with OP necessarily, but 1-2 hours usually isn't enough time between flights if you have a layover. If there's even a short delay you're at risk of missing your next flight, once you factor in the time it takes to disembark the first, maybe have a pee break, get to another gate or terminal, and boarding usually closes around 30 minutes before the flight is scheduled to take off. Some places you have to go through security again as well. If I had to book a trip in stages, I'd make sure there were at least 2 hours between the first landing and the second taking off, but more if I thought I'd want to eat or just not rush.", "Hoooollllyyyy shiiiitt. When he didn't add the time and cost into the main post I expected it to make him look bad but not THIS fuckin bad. Wow. Given how much I've been flying and seeing flight prices I assumed that the direct flight would be almost twice as much but to only be an extra $100. Shit at that point you aren't even saving anyone money since now that person is stuck in an airport needing to feed themselves between flights.", "Same, I love the Detroit airport!", "I never choose a layover of less than 90 minutes if I can help it", "What's wrong with O'Hare?? I don't fly a ton, but I had a 6.5 hour layover there last week and it was so much nicer than some of the other airports I've been in. Found some decent food, everything was clean, bathrooms were nice. \n\nThen again, I had just come out of Newark, so anything would have been nicer by comparison.", "Ohhh the biscuits from bengawan solo, my mouth is watering!\n\nDon\u2019t forget the sealed tiny orchids! I\u2019ve never managed to get one to survive repotting but one day \ud83d\ude2d"]}
