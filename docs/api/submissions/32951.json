You're already accommodating by providing drinks for the meal, which is more than enough. Being pregnant, you have every right to set boundaries, especially when it comes to additional expenses like this.", "I'm confused by this whole post. You're engaged, you're pregnant, and you're obviously planning a life together.\n\nYou have separate finances, it seems, and the way you choose to share the costs is by buying groceries on alternate weeks? I'm not sure what you're arguing about here? Are you arguing that because you're pregnant, you shouldn't have to provide wine with meals for your visitors? (It's his parents or something, isn't it?) Are you arguing that because \"a whole bunch of Christmas alcohol\" is a non-standard cost, it should be shared between you and your fiance outside your normal alternate-week shopping arrangement? Are you arguing that he should buy all the alcohol because it's his family and you won't be drinking any?\n\nSo first, given that you're planning a life and a kid together, I don't think it makes any sense to care too much about your costs vs his costs, because you should be planning to merge finances anyway, and so it will all come out in the wash.\n\nSecond, I have no idea what \"we have alcohol, but not to their taste\" means. People who say \"I'd like a nice glass of alcohol\" are alcoholics. Most people don't want generic \"alcohol\" - they want a nice bottle of wine with a meal, or they like a particular style of beer or whatever. And if this is his parents, then buying their favorites when they come to stay for Christmas is a completely normal thing for family to do.\n\nThird, if your point is that the extra costs of an expensive Christmas week should be shared between you and him, then I agree with you. Your \"alternate week\" schedule works fine to divide the costs as long as the weeks are reasonably even, but it obviously breaks when you have a massive blowout week coming up.\n\nI think I'm going to give you an ESH, because you're about to have a kid with this man, and you're going to marry him - you need to get past nitpicky arguments about whose money is going to pay for what.", "NTA. \n\nI think it makes a lot more sense for the people drinking the alcohol to buy it.

Holiday meal shopping should be separate from your turn taking system and split 50/50", "ESH, what a bizarre way to split grocery costs. Why don't you just each pay half the cost of groceries?

You're having a child with this guy, you should sort out basic shit like this because it's nonsensical. And no, it's not normal to pay \u00a3100+ for alcohol for your guest unless you're loaded.
