She thinks some of my hobbies are immature. Which is fine. She can be the mature one in our relationship. \n\nWe have two kids 7/5. Never thought I wanted kids but now know I couldn't live without them. They wanted to get me a present for my big birthday. So we went to ToysRUs and got me a sweet Lego set. Then I helped them wrap it up so I could open it up at our party. \n\nAll the guys were jealous of my new Lego set. I got some nice golf stuff and some very nice bourbon but all the guys could talk about was my new Millennium Falcon. \n\nMy wife for some reason decided to take the credit from the kids. She was telling everyone how she got it for me because I'm such a little boy at heart. Our kids heard her and were confused because they know she wasn't involved at all. They were telling everyone how they took me to the store to find something I would love. The each even put in some of their own money ($10 each) to buy my gift. \n\nWhen guys asked me about it I told the truth that my kids and I had bought it and that my gift from my wife was new golf clubs. \n\nShe is upset that the gift she got me wasn't the one everyone thought was the best. She said I should have made it shift from the family and not just the kids. \n\nI told her that her gift was amazing and that I will be using them for years and that I appreciate her getting me something that useful. But I said that the kids had chosen to get me a toy and that she shouldn't try and take credit. \n\nShe says that I didn't have to exclude her from the toy shopping.

This is why she's more upset about the situation and blaming you for admitting the truth than admitting she screwed up, since the kids spoke up and were telling everyone and you just stuck up for them by telling the truth.", "NTA\n\nIf your wife didn't want the truth to come out in detail, she should have kept her mouth shut and not spent the evening explaining how she chose this gift.\n\nIt sounds like she finds your hobby immature, but she will maybe change her mind because other people have shown an interest.", "NTA\n\nYour wife is weirdly jealous that your kids helped pick out a present for you. You didn't \"exclude\" her, she just wasn't there.", "I thought she was the mature one between the two of you? But if you do the math, she's 29. Older kid is 7. So...", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. Although for someone who you called smarter than you, your wife\u2019s action doesn\u2019t scream smart.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s not your responsibility to support your wife\u2019s lie.  Apparently her pride and need for attention is more important than the need to support her own kids and demonstrate honesty to them.", "NTA and I hope you check out the multiple LEGO subreddits. Sounds like your lovely wife likes to be the center of attention. She can\u2019t simultaneously look down on your playing with \u201ctoys\u201d (and as another AFOL - adult fan of LEGO, I take offense to what sone people create, honestly, it\u2019s incredible. I stick with VW vans and Frank Lloyd Wright houses) and also then take credit for the gift. And who is she trying to steal attention from? Her CHILDREN. She didn\u2019t like that her children \u201cstole her thunder\u201d ?!?\n\nTo me it seems like you\u2019re the mature one in the relationship.", "NAH \u2014 to me this seems similar to reasons why parents shouldn\u2019t say that one of their children is their favorite. The gifts are both great and OP\u2019s lucky to have such a thoughtful family, which I hope gets through to OP\u2019s wife somehow.", "Umm, sure seems this kind of self-absorbed behavior would have been noticed prior to kids being in the picture. ESH, but mainly the wife.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Trying to steal \"credit\" from her kids is a low blow and super embarrassing, but she embarrassed herself all on her own, and you did no wrong standing up for your kids.", "NTA I actually try and be super thoughtful with the gifts I get my partner and personalise them to him. I put a lot of effort into them, I also understand that maybe my gift will be the best gift he gets one year but maybe not the next. It\u2019s not a competition and just seeing him happy is enough.", "NTA, im still scratching my head as to why your wife wants credit for something she had nothing to do with at the expense of her kids.  Everyone know kids aren't buying that lego set without help.", "NTA but man, your wife tried to steal the thunder right out from under your kids.  Thats just shameful. She didnt think the kids, who are old enough to understand, wouldnt speak up.  HAHAH thats laughable.\n\nAlso, what an awesome birthday gift  Millennium Falcon 7541 pieces. We just got the Titanic 9090 pieces.  So much fun to build, not a clue where to put it though", "What do you mean you went to Toys R Us? Where are they still open?", "For some reason I read it as she was 29 when they met. Otherwise, yeah, if she's 29 now, that means he got her pregnant when she was 21 and he was 37. Which I can see a 21 year old thinking a 37 year old playing with Lego is childish, but it's concerning in a few ways if the 21 year old is referred to the mature one in the relationship."]}
