Why would you ever feel it's appropriate to lie about that in front of them. All it does it take away from their happiness. Not only is it the definition of gas-lighting to change the events they directly experienced, but if you had gotten away with it, it's a solid lesson that lying is fine to make yourself look better.

I see how your headline references the toys/Legos.  But I think you are a little in denial about that being the main issue here.  To my view, the toys are almost irrelevant.\n\nWhat jumps out at me is, your wife thought it was okay to 1) please her ego and soothe her insecurities, by 2) saying something completely false, in a way that 3) reduced your children, and then 4) is doubling down on the whole thing in various ways.\n\nMaybe, tangentially, she was disappointed at the popularity of the Lego relative to the golf clubs.
