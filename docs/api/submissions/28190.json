I stick with VW vans and Frank Lloyd Wright houses) and also then take credit for the gift. And who is she trying to steal attention from? Her CHILDREN.

Trying to steal \"credit\" from her kids is a low blow and super embarrassing, but she embarrassed herself all on her own, and you did no wrong standing up for your kids.", "NTA I actually try and be super thoughtful with the gifts I get my partner and personalise them to him. I put a lot of effort into them, I also understand that maybe my gift will be the best gift he gets one year but maybe not the next. It\u2019s not a competition and just seeing him happy is enough.", "NTA, im still scratching my head as to why your wife wants credit for something she had nothing to do with at the expense of her kids.  Everyone know kids aren't buying that lego set without help.", "NTA but man, your wife tried to steal the thunder right out from under your kids.  Thats just shameful. She didnt think the kids, who are old enough to understand, wouldnt speak up.  HAHAH thats laughable.\n\nAlso, what an awesome birthday gift  Millennium Falcon 7541 pieces. We just got the Titanic 9090 pieces.  So much fun to build, not a clue where to put it though", "What do you mean you went to Toys R Us? Where are they still open?", "For some reason I read it as she was 29 when they met. Otherwise, yeah, if she's 29 now, that means he got her pregnant when she was 21 and he was 37. Which I can see a 21 year old thinking a 37 year old playing with Lego is childish, but it's concerning in a few ways if the 21 year old is referred to the mature one in the relationship.", "NTA, SHE LIES IN THE BED SHE MADE DAMMIT!!!! All jokes aside she\u2019s TA trying to steal credit from your own kids. Makes her look pretty selfish. What\u2019s so wrong about your kids getting the credit over your wife?", "NTA,\nNot your fault your wife was lying lmao\n\nHave fun building the falcon, im halfway through mine and i love it!", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re not ride and die criminal partners.\n\nYou\u2019re husband and wife.\n\nCovering her lies, undermining her children, and presenting a false front are not healthy behaviour.\n\nA good husband (or wife) pushes back against unacceptable behaviour.", "NTA, this proves one more time, men want Lego sets as present.", "NTA- she sounds immature & insecure needing it to be about her. She thinks your toys are stupid until they become the popular gift...then she wants  credit? Nah.", "\"The kids were really happy they had got me something I loved, with their own money. Why would you ever feel it's appropriate to lie about that in front of them. All it does it take away from their happiness. Not only is it the definition of gas-lighting to change the events they directly experienced, but if you had gotten away with it, it's a solid lesson that lying is fine to make yourself look better. The clubs were a great gift, probably a bit too expensive if anything, and you had already knocked it out of the park with those so there wasn't any need.\"\n\nFollowed with \"No harm done, but you really can't call me immature again after this. Not that you should have for hobby in the first place.\"\n\nIt honestly sounds like you are the more mature one in this relationship. Then the seven year old, then the five year old. Your wife brings up the rear having earned her reputation for immaturity by that one single event. Take it as a win. She really can't complain about the toys now.", "NTA obviously.\n\nI'm not reading good advice here yet so here we go:\n\nMaybe let this cool of a bit first but you should talk to her about why she thought her behavior was ok. What was her goal? \n\nBut most importantly ask her to reflect on whether she wants to normalize this behavior to her kids and treat them like this. She wouldn't want to be treated like that I presume so why should she do it to her kids?", "NTA.\n\n\"*Wife, you are embarrassed that I play with toys and tell me so.

I love you, and we have a great family. The gift that you did give me was thoughtful and generous and one that I love and appreciate very much. So I cannot fathom why you would LIE about being the one to give me a gift that embarrasses you, why you would be jealous of your own children getting attention for the gift they got with me.

Why would she take credit from the kids? Her gift doesn't need to be the best one and she is acting super immature here.

That's super messed up. And the phrasing of \"From the family, not just the kids\" is setting off so many alarm bells in my head.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA at all.

She's projecting and has manipulated you into believing it.  NTA.  Your wife is the AH.", "NTA. As soon as I read your wife hates your \"toys\" I knew it was Lego. Pfft, my Lego collection is worth more than all of my furniture put together, and that's not counting the kids' Lego.

Thanks for supporting your kids telling the truth. PS. I\u2019ve got 3 Legos on the way to my house and I\u2019m mid 50s. The Falcon is a great choice!", "NTA.

Because the person whom I am reading about\u2026 is very insecure and dramatic.", "NAH I can understand your wife wanting to be the one that gave you the most popular gift. It sounds like your wife has some preconceived notions on legos and you guys might have a small communication problem. \n\nI love legos. Assembling sets are extremely relaxing.", "NTA", "Hey OP.  I see how your headline references the toys/Legos.  But I think you are a little in denial about that being the main issue here.  To my view, the toys are almost irrelevant.\n\nWhat jumps out at me is, your wife thought it was okay to 1) please her ego and soothe her insecurities, by 2) saying something completely false, in a way that 3) reduced your children, and then 4) is doubling down on the whole thing in various ways.\n\nMaybe, tangentially, she was disappointed at the popularity of the Lego relative to the golf clubs.  And maybe her need for attention temporarily eliminated her embarrassment about your toy collection.  \n\nBut how does that feeling of \u201cbummer\u201d override what one would hope to see as a natural happiness to cheer one\u2019s kids in front of other people.\n\nI\u2019d reinforce the character traits of honesty and candor with your kids, because your wife has set a bad example of lying by giving a false impression to the group (which is a specie of fraud actually), and should apologize to the kids too.  And I\u2019d also self-reflect on your wife\u2019s behavior over the years to see if you have overlooked or misinterpreted any red flag behavior, regarding any ego, candor, and/or image issues.\n\nNTA.", "Nta", "NTA, this seems a weird thing for your wife to fixate on though. It's really a non issue, is she feeling left out?", "NTA. i also find it hilarious she thinks some of your hobbies are immature when she\u2019s literally jealous of her own children\u2019s gift outshining hers. talk about immature. also i find it suuppper weird that instead of being proud of your kids for taking the time to save some money AND take daddy to pick out his own gift that she\u2019s trying to steal their thunder. as a parent you should be proud watching your kids be so sweet and thoughtful. not jealous. you should probably keep an eye on that going forward. does she always have to be in the spotlight? does she try and always take that spotlight from your kids if they\u2019re the ones getting attention?", "TF? I know TONS of adult men who invest lots of time and money into the big Lego models. One of my clients is a veteran with PTSD and it helps him immensely. NTA", "It\u2019s concerning that in a party not about her she has to try and make it about her. She\u2019s upset her gift wasn\u2019t the one ppl talked about. So, she decided to *steal credit from children to suit her ego.* that\u2019s some pretty concerning behavior and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not the first time. That needs to be nipped in the bud. Perhaps a therapist can help her understand and address why she feels the need to make the attention all about her.", "NTA. \nMy ex-husband got me legos for Christmas a couple years ago and it was the best gift ever! Enjoy your legos!!!", "Meh, sounds like you made it a point to exclude her from going with the kids to buy the gift because you don\u2019t like the fact that she thinks it\u2019s immature. Why disclose the truth in front of everyone and make it awkward unless that was your goal. It\u2019s not immature by the way, but it seems like ESH.", "So your wife is jealous that she wasn\u2019t center stage at your birthday? Does she always have to get all the attention all the time? It\u2019s really unhealthy to be hogging the spotlight, especially from your kids.
