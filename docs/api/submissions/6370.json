Then it is at least he knows that water costs money.\n\nBUT I think you are probably more annoyed that she is there and taking the bathroom for so long than you are about the water bill.

So I just googled the heating costs.  In the US, it's roughly equivalent to the cost of the water to heat a standard shower to 104F.  By comparison, in the UK, the heating costs is about double or more.  Yay, cheap  gas in the US.\n\nSo, that roughly brings the cost to $1.02 for that 30 minute shower.", "It can be quite difficult especially when in some cases there's a large age gap.

And he's not asked for a raise either? This would be my hill to die on. Idk, I see others are suggesting you charge him or warn him first, but I have a feeling he's had this attitude before/not the first time. That being said, assert yourself and lay down the rules hard, he has to deal with the consequences he (or his gf) earned through their attitudes.", "Cool! So the answer is actually to let your brother know that she will either start contributing rent & utilities for living with you 75% of the time or she may be a house guest once or twice a week maximum  or X number of hours maximum, but since she doesn\u2019t live here, she may not engage in any of the things that would entail that she live here (can\u2019t use the kitchen or showers etc. like a normal visitor (you decide how often) and if he violates these basic decency rules, then he will need to find a new place to live so you can find a more respectable roommate. \n\nAnd I need to add that your brother should be paying half the utilities. Stop enabling your brother. And realize that you aren\u2019t responsible for his GF behavior. Your brother is. \n\nI think setting the timer thing is a bad idea. The problem is that they are both tending towards free-loading and once you handle the shower situation, they will find something else to free-load off of.", "On the lease/mortgage or not, depending on where you live she may have spent enough time at your place to establish tenant rights.  You should tread carefully how you go about resolution.  You've got the personal angle of course, but if your area has laws that consider her a tenant, you may not be able to get her out of she fights.", "Oh yuk.. why would they mix a food smell with poop?! My mom is into floral scents. When I still lived at home I told her I'd rather just smell shit lol", "It can feel a bit uncomfortable but it's reality. She's essentially moved in. The bills are going to be higher. She's timed out on living somewhere freely. Her parents may not charge her (or maybe they are crunched financially) but this affects *your* finances and is choking you.", "Sounds like your little brother needs to pay half the rent AND utilities.  Once the problem is partly his, it'll be easier for him to understand the problem and obvious solutions.", "Don't charge her, charge him.  This is between you and your brother.  Show him the water bills before she started showering there and the current water bill.  Your mistake was bringing it up to her at all.  He should pay the excess for his guests or be the one to tell her not to shower there", "So I tried the soft approach initially which didn't really work and after that gave my sister a little bit of an ultimatum.\n\nPay 50% of her salary as rent, stop wasting money on all these things she didn't need and pay for groceries every second week or move out. I gave her 3 months.\n\nI would never have thrown her to the streets because at the end of the day, she was my little sister and although it was tight I could afford it, but she didn't know that.\n\nAfter 2 months she did cut back significantly and acted a bit more grown up but it took about 6 months for her to fully get her shit together. 3 years later she wanted to move out and rent a place of her own and all the extra money that she was paying as \"rent\" came to about \u00a330,000 and she'd manage to save a further \u00a315,000. This meant she didn't need to rent and had enough for a deposit to buy a place instead\n\nShe was 24 when she was at that point and she didn't go to university instead doing an apprenticeship at 17 instead because of her grades. One of the reasons she never really grew up because as the baby of the family my parents spoiled her to no end and then when she didn't go to university because of her grades they were not happy at all", "Haha I agree 100%"]}
