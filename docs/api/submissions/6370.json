Idk, I see others are suggesting you charge him or warn him first, but I have a feeling he's had this attitude before/not the first time. That being said, assert yourself and lay down the rules hard, he has to deal with the consequences he (or his gf) earned through their attitudes.", "Cool! So the answer is actually to let your brother know that she will either start contributing rent & utilities for living with you 75% of the time or she may be a house guest once or twice a week maximum  or X number of hours maximum, but since she doesn\u2019t live here, she may not engage in any of the things that would entail that she live here (can\u2019t use the kitchen or showers etc. like a normal visitor (you decide how often) and if he violates these basic decency rules, then he will need to find a new place to live so you can find a more respectable roommate. \n\nAnd I need to add that your brother should be paying half the utilities. Stop enabling your brother. And realize that you aren\u2019t responsible for his GF behavior. Your brother is. \n\nI think setting the timer thing is a bad idea.

Once the problem is partly his, it'll be easier for him to understand the problem and obvious solutions.", "Don't charge her, charge him.  This is between you and your brother.  Show him the water bills before she started showering there and the current water bill.  Your mistake was bringing it up to her at all.  He should pay the excess for his guests or be the one to tell her not to shower there", "So I tried the soft approach initially which didn't really work and after that gave my sister a little bit of an ultimatum.\n\nPay 50% of her salary as rent, stop wasting money on all these things she didn't need and pay for groceries every second week or move out. I gave her 3 months.\n\nI would never have thrown her to the streets because at the end of the day, she was my little sister and although it was tight I could afford it, but she didn't know that.\n\nAfter 2 months she did cut back significantly and acted a bit more grown up but it took about 6 months for her to fully get her shit together. 3 years later she wanted to move out and rent a place of her own and all the extra money that she was paying as \"rent\" came to about \u00a330,000 and she'd manage to save a further \u00a315,000.

Either ask her to take shorter showers or ask your brother to chip in on the utilities (or both).  Instead you made her feel very unwelcome.

Her parents have likely told her they have to stop because of rising costs, so now she's taking those long showers somewhere it doesn't cost anyone she actually cares about any money.", "I took tons of showers at my then-boyfriend's place when we first started dating, because I'd stay over for the weekends. The alternative would be no showers all weekend. Think it through!", "It\u2019s her place, the brother just stays there if he had a problem he can move in with little miss doesn\u2019t pay fuck all.", "Maybe she wants to shower DURING sex!", "My showers are around 30 minutes. IDK about the girlfriend, but I'm a dude with long, curly hair. Curly hair... requires a LOT of wet work. It's either doing it in the shower, or doing it in the sink, and either one is going to require oodles of hot water.\n\nBrother needs to pay his half of the utilities if him and his girl are using them, but a 30 minute shower is not that weird, especially with long hair and ESPECIALLY with long, curly hair.", "> ISTG\n\nWhat in good lord does this stand for? So many acronyms these days... I am only 31 and I cannot understand like 80% of them.", "Thanks for the insight. Utilities are still new to me, trying to learn more so I can try to save a little there. I\u2019m also realizing that bill was before we got the washing machine, so now I\u2019m a little more worried.", "That\u2019s fair. Thinking about it more, if I was 18 and someone tried to use a timer on my showers, I\u2019d be pissed lmao", "I\u2019m working on getting the bill printouts with everything explained, it\u2019s more difficult than I remember it being last time I checked", "Maybe they can switch to that god awful febreeze they spray everywhere when they shit. Much more cost effective and potent as all hell", "I actually have it! I love it. It sits right next to their febreeze, they just refuse to use it for some reason. I\u2019ve explained it and everything", "Does OP have gas? The post only mentions electric and water bills. And I think electric water heaters are more expensive than gas, depending on the area. \ud83e\udd14\n\nBut probably still not a significant difference.", "I agree. I definitely handled it poorly and need to apologize and explain where I\u2019m coming from. Thank you", "No. Mostly because the person he shares a shower with is super anal about being clean and would know if anyone else took a shower there.", "I just now saw there was an edit that the brother lives with her, so yea I get it's not really random.  That being said, no I haven't showered at a significant other's place due to the fact I've lived on my own since 19 and my then boyfriend, now husband moved in with me fairly quickly, so it was never an issue.  That being said, I do understand now her wanting to shower there, but unless she starts contributing, she needs to either stop or take a way shorter shower.", "Is she bringing her own shower stuff? No probably not.", "It depends on the person and dynamic. I dated a guy for 2 years and we never once showered at each other's houses, but had a fuck buddy for a month or two and showered there. If they have roommates, it's not expected and kinda weird to shower at their place", " Otherwise, no. Maybe she doesn't even know he isn't helping with those bills. But either way, then it's up to your brother what he wants to do, and you won't look like the bad guy.", "She can stay at her own house and shower there. The man pays rent for ONE PERSON and zero utilities he\u2019s lucky she lets this women stay at all. They can move out and get their own apartment.", "30 minutes is definitely excessive, but it is beyond normal to shower at a significant other\u2019s home", "Close the valve to the hot water after 15 minutes :)", "You don't need to wash your hair after sex (usually anyway), that's not where the smell is coming from. If it's a post coitus shower she can trim it down, if it's an everything shower she can either do that at home or pay for the utilities.", "Yeah but you don't need to wash your hair every shower, and she can do that at home. I have long curly hair and it doesn't take 30 mins to take an everything hair shave shower unless you are just slow", "I swear to god. \n\nI'm 34. Not sure what age has to do with acronyms.", "The washing machine is gonna hurt. I don't mean to scare you, but it will.\n\nThis is my first place covering my own water. Little things can help. Try not to run the sink when brushing teeth or washing dishes (easier said than done.) Check your outdoor spigots for leaks, check your toilet tank and make sure the plunger closes and it isn't running at a slow trickle for hours.\n\nI think the real clincher is, bro should be paying utilities. $100/mo turns into $50 each if he's pulling his weight. And neither he nor GF should be running a washer they're not paying for.\n\nWhy isn't brother paying on bills, if I can ask?", "If girlfriend is there often & using water/electricity too, then your brother should cover 75% of the utility,  not half. \n\nAlso, depending on how often she's there overnight,  you need to check your rental contract to see if its allowed.  A guest that often could run you into trouble depending on rules of your tenancy. She could be viewed as a resident, especially if she's often showering there. \n\n\nBTW, you could get her a gift of a shower cap.. to protect her hair while she takes a 5 minute shower if getting clean is her primaryintention. . \ud83d\ude09\n\nNTA", "That explains the febreezing the death out of every bowel movement.", "Me being 30 years old I'd be even more pissed and probably get out and throw the timer XD", "This commenter you\u2019re replying to is deranged btw. Literally just tell him that the water bill has been crazy since she started snowing there and ask him to split the utilities. He pays half the rent so he\u2019s probably just assumed that he\u2019s entitled to offer up a place to shower to his girlfriend after they\u2019ve been intimate and didn\u2019t realize that it was really making a difference in what you\u2019re paying. He isn\u2019t \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of you, you haven\u2019t even asked him to do anything yet", "She's never had to pay her own bills so probably doesnt know how she's affecting you. Talk to both of them about a compromise rather than making your brother mad at you for just banning her instead of using your adult words to explain the problem and come up with an acceptable solution.", "My dad has gotten like that with age, if there's even an eyelash left in the tub he'll come remind me to clean up after. Isn't mean about it at least, even apologizes because he knows it's an anxiety thing, but damn is it annoying.", "Dude it's a shower. The thing cleans itself.", "\\>shudders in Californian<", "If she usually takes long showers then she's just taking a normal shower for her. \n\nOP should be talking to the brother instead of going directly after the girlfriend.", "Probably. You know a lot of women that like using mens\u2019 products?\n\nThis isn\u2019t directed at you personally, but a general observation from the comments here. You always see people on Reddit complaining about being alone or single. Nitpicking the use of some shampoo or complaining about shower time without having an adult conversation about the issue is a great way to maintain that.", "Maybe it\u2019s a regional thing. Had roommates for a long time and if the relationship is serious you fully expect the SOs to be around overnight which would absolutely include showers. \n\nAnd when the frequency of visits picked up, we just talked about it. \n\n\u201cHey she\u2019s here like three nights a week - so we need to look at the bills as a 3 way split.\u201d  \n\n\u201cYep makes sense.\u201d", "I really try not to think about it\u2026 but deep down I think I knew that", "As a female with longer hair, 30 minutes is average for me to properly wash & condition my hair (almost grown down to the small of my back) as well as clean myself; I only wash my hair every 3-4 days but everyone is different.", "Maybe I am slow. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I have a connective tissue disorder. And yeah, I do have to wash my hair every shower, because it's ultra fine and will grease up within a day and a half. \n\nI'm glad you're so swift, and I'm sorry my connective tissue disorder that makes it difficult to move around, I guess, makes me a pathetic little slow-y pants.", "Age has a LOT to do with language. Acronyms are language.", "I took him in to live with me as soon as he graduated away from my parents house due to neglect/abuse. The idea behind him living with me was for him to be able to save money so he could move out on his own. But then I got sick and I lost my job, and I can\u2019t afford what I used to be able to afford. Circumstances have changed in a way I didn\u2019t prepare for. And now I feel like I\u2019m screwing him over on our deal because of an issue unrelated to him.", "Hahah I was hoping that one will go away with age! The bathroom is right next to my bedroom, and even with the door closed, my entire room reeks of shit febreeze", "The term that could apply here is squatters\u2019 rights, but I agree that she should check her local laws.", "Take a chill pill, dude. The kid has been an adult for like 30 seconds, he's gonna have some missteps. Chances are he'll get his shit together sooner than later, he's just learning still.", "I dont get it, people here always are like \"yeah, just throw him out\" \"youll be better off without them\" without taking into account it is family. and we dont know how deep their bond actually goes.   \n\n\nHe should talk to his brother, maybe the GF is not even realizing how expensive energy and water can be. NTA, and I understand him, but there are better solutions than throwing a 18 year old sibling out after having a tough childhood together.", "Yeeeeah. I have a feeling my boyfriend isn\u2019t the one cleaning the shower.", "Why??? the brothers not paying the utilities OP is and the girlfriend is using them. You don't get a grown up side bar if you still think it's someone else's job to powder your bottom.", "Hahaha this is my favorite comment! I'm with you--so much immaturity up in here.", "... which is basically *why* she showers. Afterward.", "Just ban her from the shower. Your brother doesn\u2019t even pay utilities therefore he has no right to say who goes in and out of the shower. All he does is pay to live there not for some girl to waste your water. Your brother doesn\u2019t have to like it he just has to suck it up, if he has a problem he can move else where and pay for the water she uses :)", "Yah, my hair is just past my shoulders, but it's super curly and takes at least 20 minutes just to wash, condition, and detangle. A 30 minute shower is hustling for wash days.", "I was looking for this response. Certain types, thicknesses, and lengths of hair require longer showers. I've got hair down to my butt and it takes me \\~30 minutes to do a full hair day (though that's not every day or every shower)", "I am so sorry you have a medical reason to take long showers but it is not the norm for most people. Originally you stated it was due to your long hair, not a medical issue. As long as you pay for your own water take as long as you want to, but don't go to people's houses to take a long shower if you don't need to and you are not paying.\n\n I never called you pathetic, but without the information on your unique medical diagnosis how would anyone know that is why you take long showers?", "Ugh calm down, getting passive aggressive over nothing, no one is shaming you", "Cool, people should definitely downvote me for it and otherwise ignore the point. Totally makes sense.", "If he lived alone he'd have to pay his own bills.\n\nYou're not screwing him over. Circumstances has changed. You cannot afford to share this apartment anymore if he doesn't contribute. Would both of you ending up homeless be preferable?", "This is worth adding to your OP. You\u2019re not a miserly Scrooge just trying to nickel and dime him for no reason, you just literally can\u2019t afford it. I\u2019d grab your water bill and show how much it\u2019s gone up since this started, and let them choose: either they chip in for utilities, or she needs to stop using them. (Tbh, you should\u2019ve been charging him for utilities anyway.) Explain that you don\u2019t have the money because of your circumstances, so either they foot the difference in the bills or they knock it off.", "Well damn, that's nasty! I know there are drops that people put in the toilet before using it to prevent any smells, maybe buy a bottle and not-so-subtly leave it out for them.", "Oh, my bad, I hadn't realized op mentioned the age.", "I didn't realize the age was mentioned, only until you said something.", "OP's brother should be paying utilities. Problem solved.", "I mean, it takes me just as long to take care of my hair on wash hair days, but are yall doing your hair things with the water constantly running? Where I'm from it's common practice to turn the water on only for rinsing off to conserve water. It doesn't need to be on while you're applying shampoo, conditioner or other treatments, or detangling, etc...", "I don't consider 30 minutes a \"long shower,\" especially in the context of long hair, so it didn't seem relevant to the issue at first. Now an internet stranger is shaming me for being \"slow\" in the shower so I felt that I had to defend myself. You needed more context to defend my 30 minute shower -- context I didn't really feel was necessary since I still think self care and hair care are very valid reasons to take one's time in the shower -- so I gave you more context, because I don't feel comfortable having my self care shamed by someone I don't know, who doesn't know me or my needs.", "Idk why they would downvote you. We're both just chatting and tryna figure shit out lol", "Hahah I agree, I\u2019m seriously considering it. But I\u2019m trying to be patient and choose my battles for now, one thing at a time", "Thats because you did not care to ask nor check, but preferred jumping to conclusions and giving advice right away. Others did, and there, OP said that his brother as well as his GF are 18. \n\n\"Hes an adult now and making poor choices\" \n\n\"I feel like its not the first time\" - a lot of assuming here.", "Yes, I run the water constantly while showering. When I first get in, I have to drench my hair before shampooing (I shampoo twice because of the thickness) then I rinse & gently ring out any excess moisture before liberally applying conditioner then wash & scrub my body while my hair is absorbing the conditioner then I rinse out my hair again then put it up in a spider claw to wash my back to prevent bacne. The only time I turn the water off is when I need to apply a hair mask (after swimming in chlorinated water or excessive heat damage), then I get out of the shower after shampooing because those take a minimum of 30 minutes to actually work for my hair.", "Again, take whatever time you need, if YOU are paying the water bill. Don't go to your friends house and take a long shower you don't need and wash your hair when it is not necessary. Sorry you felt the need to get defensive about information that you shared in a public forum. People disagree sometimes, what most people seem to agree on in OP is NTA.", "It's not an excuse, however I commented on this originally around six minutes after he posted it, and hadn't looked at it again until recently. I understand now that I was wrong. Thanks.", "You're good, sorry for being a little harsh before. I just notice there is a pattern on reddit of people \"giving advice\" without having the whole picture.   \nOfc, OP is also to blame here for not initially providing all necessary information for this kind of evaluation, but yeah, he did eventually.   \n\n\nAs someone coming from a difficult family myself (with all siblings having a lot of errors, including myself), they still (with my mom) are what is left of my family. and therefore these small things might annoy me as a brother, but I would never do anything that would jeopardize my relationships with my siblings in any serious way (such as kicking them out). I guess its all a question of perspective. As always, lol.   \n\n\nTake care."]}
