Idk, I see others are suggesting you charge him or warn him first, but I have a feeling he's had this attitude before/not the first time. That being said, assert yourself and lay down the rules hard, he has to deal with the consequences he (or his gf) earned through their attitudes.", "Cool! So the answer is actually to let your brother know that she will either start contributing rent & utilities for living with you 75% of the time or she may be a house guest once or twice a week maximum  or X number of hours maximum, but since she doesn\u2019t live here, she may not engage in any of the things that would entail that she live here (can\u2019t use the kitchen or showers etc. like a normal visitor (you decide how often) and if he violates these basic decency rules, then he will need to find a new place to live so you can find a more respectable roommate. \n\nAnd I need to add that your brother should be paying half the utilities. Stop enabling your brother. And realize that you aren\u2019t responsible for his GF behavior. Your brother is. \n\nI think setting the timer thing is a bad idea. The problem is that they are both tending towards free-loading and once you handle the shower situation, they will find something else to free-load off of.", "On the lease/mortgage or not, depending on where you live she may have spent enough time at your place to establish tenant rights.

Once the problem is partly his, it'll be easier for him to understand the problem and obvious solutions.", "Don't charge her, charge him.  This is between you and your brother.  Show him the water bills before she started showering there and the current water bill.  Your mistake was bringing it up to her at all.  He should pay the excess for his guests or be the one to tell her not to shower there", "So I tried the soft approach initially which didn't really work and after that gave my sister a little bit of an ultimatum.\n\nPay 50% of her salary as rent, stop wasting money on all these things she didn't need and pay for groceries every second week or move out. I gave her 3 months.\n\nI would never have thrown her to the streets because at the end of the day, she was my little sister and although it was tight I could afford it, but she didn't know that.\n\nAfter 2 months she did cut back significantly and acted a bit more grown up but it took about 6 months for her to fully get her shit together. 3 years later she wanted to move out and rent a place of her own and all the extra money that she was paying as \"rent\" came to about \u00a330,000 and she'd manage to save a further \u00a315,000.

One long, hot shower is not going to materially change the amount of gas and water the whole building used for the month.\" I would offer the same today in a single family home where I pay directly for my own gas and water (a single 30-minute shower might cost me $1? Probably less? I'm doing a favor for someone in a bad situation!). But if you're showering there regularly, you chip into the costs! If one long shower is $1, or even $.50, 30 long showers start to add up! Bottom line, you don't add extra expenses without offering to cover them!"]}
