Last summer my SIL \"Katrina\" dropped her daughter \"Meg\" (10) off for a picnic at my MILs house that we we're attending.\n\nSince my son was about a year old, my SIL decided my son was autistic. Her only reasoning is his speech delay (I'll also mention there's no concerns of autism from his pediatrician). Ever since, everytime we see her, she tells me we need to get our son diagnosed.\n\nAt this picnic, Meg comes running up to my son (2 at the time) and gets in his face and demands a hug and starts talking to him. He hid behind my husband since 1) he was overtired from traveling all day, and 2) he doesn't know her very well. She then says to us \"there's something wrong with him, you need to get him diagnosed\".\n\nNeedless to say I was shocked. This isn't something I expected from a kid her age, but instantly recognized the words as repetition of things her mother has said to us. Mostly, I'm furious at Katrina because it seems an inappropriate thing to say about my son in front of his cousin.\n\nMy other SIL Rachel watches 3rd SIL Samantha's 2 boys regularly, and sometimes my son. This week since all the kids are on school vacation, she wanted to invite Meg over while my son was there. I told her that I wasn't comfortable with that (we have not seen Meg and Katrina since the incident) especially since Rachel doesn't think Meg did anything wrong, so I can't count on her to ensure repeat behavior doesn't occur. \n\nWhile Katrina and Meg are welcome to say and feel whatever they like about my child, I don't ever want my son to think that having some sort of diagnosis means that \"there's something wrong with him\" - I believe in accepting people for who they are. Furthermore, Meg has made comments about excluding or picking on kids at school and Katrina dismisses it or laughs along with her.\n\nMy husband agrees with me but his whole family is mad at me for \"breaking up the family\" so, AITA for refusing a playdate to keep my son from potentially being bullied?", "created_utc": 1677181000, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11a6jpj/aita_for_refusing_a_playdate_for_my_son/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And then there are children who reach those stages later. Doesn't necessarily mean they're on the spectrum or have learning disabilities or whatever. Could simply mean they're \"gathering\" words for some time and start to speak when they're ready for it. My oldest brother hardly spoke and mainly communicated by signing till well after his third birthday, and then surprised us all by an above-average speech development (i.e. complete sentences, correct grammar etc). Same with my youngest granddaughter. I even caught her \"practising\" new words, but when I asked her to repeat them, she alway shook her head.

Every kid is different, and they all grow and learn at different ages. If there is no medical concern from an actual medical professional, there is no reason at all to diagnose a child and certainly not to her face.

Maybe the kids should spend time together with alert adults close enough to immediately stop and correct any unkind behavior?
