My parents are very proud of him but I've felt like they've always liked him more, saying things like he's the child they've always wanted (I was an unplanned pregnancy), boys are so much easier to raise, and he's so smart and gifted (which wouldn't offend me as much if they'd ever said anything similar to me, which they haven't, even though we've had similar performances in school and activities).  \n\nEver since realizing his interest in psychology a few years ago, my brother's been using terms to \"psychoanalyze\" us. He especially likes to point out my \"deflection\" and \"displacement\" every time I get angry at him or try to ask for equal treatment as him. Whenever my parents have friends over he'll try to impress them by quoting this researcher or that theory. I think it makes him insufferable and pompous but what bothers me even more is that my parents adore how \"clever and accomplished\" he is.  \n\nWell, I decided to utilize the internet to learn some fun new psychology/therapy terms. However, I've been using these terms slightly wrong because I know it annoys my brother. When my brother told me I was exhibiting symptoms of a depressive disorder, I told him he should try to Pavlov them out of me. I don't think that's how depressive disorders or Pavlov work, but it got him quiet. \n\nRecently we had gone to the grocery store (our parents wanted us to \"spend time together so we would stop fighting\" and also get them groceries) and my brother saw one of his coworkers and went to start talking to her.  My brother quietly told me to \"get my Cluster B self out of the way\" so I responded by shouting at my brother \"You can't reveal my Narcissistic Personality Disorder! That's violating HIPAA\" He looked confused so I continued \"I finally felt like we had a rapport! Now you're giving me transferance!\" His coworker also started looking confused so I started fake-wailing and said \"You've shamed me and haven't held space for my processing. You're a cognitive distortion!\" My brother responded by shouting, \"You can't be a cognitive distortion! You HAVE cognitive distortions!\" His coworker probably thought we were unhinged and walked away. \n\nWell now my brother's angry at me because he says that his coworker's been avoiding him and his whole office thinks he's weird.  I'm honestly happy because he hasn't tried to call me Cluster B or any other term any time recently. My parents are angry at me because they said that I've stooped to his level and I responded by saying that I wished I could stoop to his level because maybe then they'd like me like they like him. Then my mother started crying and I felt badly so I apologized. Now I'm thinking what I did was kind of excessive and immature, but I also don't think it was unasked for.

We\u2019re told to do no harm, to not diagnose/counsel/label friends/family/co-workers and to learn how to separate work from home. I personally see this behavior as nasty, and to be frank, he should be using what he learned to start his own work and confront the family dynamics that have allowed for displacement and deflection. \n\nIf his coworker is avoiding him it\u2019s probably because of his own actions.

And this is nothing new, there are a lot of families where one child is favored over the other.

The fact that he uses comments like \"get your cluster b self out of here\" makes me so concerned that he is an actual therapist. Shows he already has a bias towards certain diagnoses and is clearly not self aware enough to see how he is harming his sibling. All in all it is a bad look as a brother and especially a bad look as someone who is a therapist.", "NTA Your parents are ignoring your feelings to accommodate your brother.

Better you report him to his professional association for misuse of personal information within the family.", "NTA, but your family... yikes.\n\nAlso, I kinda think your parents are the real problem here, making your brother the golden child. \n\nIf nothing else, the fact you could pull this off intentionally makes you every bit as clever as your brother. \n\nYou should put that to good use. Go out and be successful, and maybe go LC with your rotten family.", "NTA.

Even if you do have some type of personality disorder, I'd highly doubt your brother diagnosed you, and certainly shouldn't be using it as an insulting term regardless. \n\nI am the older sibling in a pair much like yours, but reversed as I was adopted in as a last resort when my family couldn't conceive. My younger brother of 2 years was the miracle child they were blessed with, and I became the problem extra child they didn't want and they've continued to favor him up into our adult years. My mother went out of my way to get him a high level position at her bank before she retired, and wouldn't even help get me an entry level teller position at a different bank as she seems shamed to have me even in the bank, let alone working with her former coworkers. I feel your pain, but if you don't want to cut your parents out entirely, I'd just accept how they feel and learn to live with that fact.

However, I've been using these terms slightly wrong because I know it annoys my brother. When my brother told me I was exhibiting symptoms of a depressive disorder, I told him he should try to Pavlov them out of me. I don't think that's how depressive disorders or Pavlov work, but it got him quiet. \n\nRecently we had gone to the grocery store (our parents wanted us to \"spend time together so we would stop fighting\" and also get them groceries) and my brother saw one of his coworkers and went to start talking to her.  My brother quietly told me to \"get my Cluster B self out of the way\" so I responded by shouting at my brother \"You can't reveal my Narcissistic Personality Disorder! That's violating HIPAA\" He looked confused so I continued \"I finally felt like we had a rapport! Now you're giving me transferance!\" His coworker also started looking confused so I started fake-wailing and said \"You've shamed me and haven't held space for my processing. You're a cognitive distortion!\" My brother responded by shouting, \"You can't be a cognitive distortion! You HAVE cognitive distortions!\" His coworker probably thought we were unhinged and walked away. \n\nWell now my brother's angry at me because he says that his coworker's been avoiding him and his whole office thinks he's weird.  I'm honestly happy because he hasn't tried to call me Cluster B or any other term any time recently. My parents are angry at me because they said that I've stooped to his level and I responded by saying that I wished I could stoop to his level because maybe then they'd like me like they like him. Then my mother started crying and I felt badly so I apologized. Now I'm thinking what I did was kind of excessive and immature, but I also don't think it was unasked for.

She's 18, this is going to eat her up soon and she's going to be embarassed, and she's going to think back on this situation when she's thinking about her family. It's a good time now to tell her there are better ways to get your way than utter humiliation and theatrics.", "Her brother is being a major AH to her and bullying her, it\u2019s not just her parents. Idk, I\u2019m not trying to be argumentative with you for the sake of being argumentative or anything, but it feels like the older brother is being a major bully, and you\u2019re saying Op the victim should suck it up quietly. I\u2019ve been the victim of bullying and I\u2019ve sucked it up quietly, it just made it worse for me and looking back I wish I\u2019d stood up for myself more. It\u2019s worked for Op finally in that he\u2019s stopped calling her Cluster B.", "What she said was funny because it was comically incorrect. She knew that, which is why she said it. You came in and tried to be all \u201cactually little lady, what you said was not far off from Pavlov\u201d blah, blah, blah, but YOU were wrong so I corrected you. End of. Now I will bid you good day and wish you well \u270c\ud83c\udffc", "In no way did I say OP should suck it up quietly. I said - \"If you want your brother to tone down the psychobabble just tell him to do so.\"", "> but YOU were wrong so I corrected you.\n\nExcept I didn't ask for correction.  You came in and used your professional credentials to intimidate and harass me into changing my stance - which, correct me if I'm wrong (you haven't stopped thus far) is a violation of BACB ethics code.", "Lmao what pillowy soft nonsense is this? What intimidation and harassment? You said some wrong things, got dunked on by someone with subject matter expertise, and are now crying about it. Someone is coming off poorly here and it\u2019s not your interlocutor."]}
