Maybe you should start mispronouncing their names too and see what happens.\n\nBut back to the issue at hand, I'd skip it.  Thanksgiving is in 3 days, and they now want you to spend 12+ hours driving to get there?  That's a huge change with very little notice.

I could see them calling you a dumb nickname *occasionally* just for fun, but just straight up pronouncing it wrong on purpose for THREE YEARS? Yeah, no. Not cool.\n\nAlso, your bf is showing some serious red flags.", "NTA. Boyfriend should be standing up for you and making them pronounce it correctly.

Has he talked to them alone about this? I also think the last minute change in plans, expecting you to drive 12 hours vs 1 hour, is an unfair request. It sounds like there is a larger issue of respect going on with his family. If your boyfriend isn\u2019t willing to stand up for you, I\u2019d question the longevity of the relationship if I were you.", "NTA, but your boyfriend and his family certainly are for being so disrespectful.

He needs to go with them solo, maybe he'll see how disrespectful they are towards you then.", "NTA, messing up a name once or twice, apologizing, and correcting themselves is one thing. But purposely calling you names you've corrected them on before is not cool. Especially when your name isn't hard to pronounce and you are okay with it being pronounced in their language, there shouldn't be an excuse. And then to suggest you're not American enough? If your boyfriend wants to play \"put the family first\" card, then he needs to start putting your feelings first as well if he considers you as part of the family.
