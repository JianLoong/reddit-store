I also don't think you should step out for a minute as a restaurant host to collect yourself during a rush. Either you can keep up or not. This man is a new manager and he may not think you can cope with your assigned task and is offering you a position in the back of the house based on your performance.

However, I suggest you protect yourself by making it a 3 person conversation, whether it be another manager or coworker.", "I think it's fair to have a conversation about it. That you've been allowed to take a minute since you've been working as hostess, so this comes as a surprise. \n\nBut what will you say if he says, \"I don't want you doing that, it's unacceptable?\" Will you be able to stick it out without a break?\n\nBTW, when you take these breaks, are there people waiting? Is it a smoke break? Just trying to get   a picture.", "NTA\n\nTake it up a level with management.\n\nAre you sure Ed is really a manager?  Dishwashing does not seem compatible with being a manager and supervising the whole operation.  \n\nYour job is as a hostess.  Everyone is allowed an occasional break during a busy shift.\n\nI suspect Ed is trying to dump the dishwashing on someone else.", "NAH You can talk to your manager about your shifts. Don't expect much though.", "NTA but just to be safe, ha e a third person there, maybe another manager, when you talk to ED. or, you could go to one of the other managers and ask them about the sudden switch.", "A lot of people step outside to take smoke breaks and stuff.....and I've always had permission to take a minute as most of the managers there know that hosting is a hard job, especially on weekends. \n\nAre you a manager? If so, please explain this to me as maybe I don't understand: when new managers arrive at a place (restaurant or not), do they not talk to other managers about how different employees work? So they can get a feel for them and their abilities?", "Thank you, an explanation is much more reasonable. I guess I was too upset and used the word confront instead.", "If I do take breaks, it's usually when \n\n1) there's no one at the door \n\nor \n\n2) we have a waitlist and I'm waiting for tables to be clear. \n\nI don't take that long of a break, just a minute or two, and then I go right back to my job. Sometimes I'll take a break from hosting and do something like rolling silverwear if we're all out. But if I do roll silverwear, I always ask management if I can leave my post before I do anything.", "Oh! Sorry, Ed didn't work as the dishwasher yesterday. I worked as a dishwasher and he was the manager on the shift. Sorry, I should have made that more clear!", "Are your breaks scheduled and approved by management?", "I\u2019m a manager and I can say no we don\u2019t usually have time. All employees should have training and if there\u2019s more than one location, the role is the same. A hostess is a hostess. Different places might have details or slightly different procedures at a different place.", "My breaks aren't scheduled but a lot of times a manager will come up to the host stand and tell me to go take a minute. \n\nI'm autistic but I never asked for that accommodation. One of the managers has a kid and a brother on the spectrum and he started giving me permission to go take a minute to myself if I got overwhelmed pretty much the first time I worked with him.", "Well there in lies your problem, you didn't clear any of this with the new manager. You assumed it would be okay."]}
