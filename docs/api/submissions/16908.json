Don\u2019t do this, your parents I\u2019m sure wish you didn\u2019t have to deal with this situation I\u2019m sure, but if they have your back don\u2019t project your aunts negativity on to them and imagine that you are in the wrong; you are doing yourself a disservice. Don\u2019t let her get in your head and doubt yourself! Rock those gloves xx", "NTA. You were at a freaking cookout!! Not a damn 5 star dining restaurant. Your Aunt intentionally did that to you and I hope someone chewed her ass out for it!", "NTA. Your great aunt doesn't get to push you around. \n\nThe fight was not your fault. Things escalated because they would have used any excuse to start a fight. Toxic people always find a way. If it hadn't been your gloves, it would have been something else. You have no part of the blame. You owe no one any apologies. Your great aunt owes one to you and to the rest of the family for purposely starting up some shit.", "Could have asked her to please remove her makeup and live with the good lord gave her. NTA", " NTA from what you\u2019ve said the issue isn\u2019t you not taking off the gloves but your great aunt choosing to make a scene making fun of your insecurities and then blame your parents. \n\nYou didn\u2019t cause a scene, you protected your mental health and left the situation. That sounds like a sensible thing to do. If your aunt had left you alone or excepted no as your answer and moved on the evening wouldn\u2019t have been ruined. Your great aunt ruined the evening not you", "NTA, but your aunt should apologize before she steps foot in your house again.", "NTA seriously when will people learn to mind their own business?", "NTA. Your aunt sounds like an insufferable busy body who needs to learn to stay in her lane and keep her mouth shut. She was also a poor guest. Starting a fight in her hosts' home; Miss Manners would not approve! You should also bring back ladies hats to go along with the gloves; complete the look.", "NTA, you did not make a scene, your great aunt did. She's TA", "NTA. Have you seen the haunting of hill house? Because gloves totally give a Theo vibe and I\u2019m here for it!!!", "definitely NTA.\n\nwhy do people never learn that unless something is harmful it is literally none of their business?? you have every right to wear whatever makes you feel comfortable and if someone doesn't like it they need to get over it. it wasn't you who started anything either, you were just trying to get on with your life and your great aunt wouldn't let you. you are in no way at fault for the argument as you did nothing to provoke it - your aunt is entirely to blame and i'm sorry you feel bad about it.", "NTA. Fuck that noise, you do what makes you comfortable", "NTA, your aunt needed to mind HER business.", "None of that argument was your fault and I\u2019d venture to say, your aunt would have found a way to stir shit up no matter who she had to attack in order to do so.

Even if you didn\u2019t have scarring or anything it\u2019s just gloves. It\u2019s also 2023 and insane manners aren\u2019t really that important anymore.

Because in normal families, what the great-aunt has to say about someone is irrelevant.", "NTA- for your aunt to make such a big deal about something to hide a visual thing that bothers you in a family setting like that is horrible.\n\nIf she wanted to talk to you about being comfortable without your gloves, she could have talked to you privately.  That would have shown care and consideration and concern and possibly love.  \nShe wanted to stir drama. She wanted to single you out in front of everybody.\n\nAnd honestly if it hadn't been you it probably would have been someone or something else.\n\nYou are in no way the a-hole. And you can bring that point up.  If she was concerned about you being conscientious about your hands, then why did she talked to you privately about something that she knew you were sensitive about?", "Your great aunt, in attempting to promote traditional etiquette, made a far more serious offense in commenting on the manners of another adult. Even your own mother would be expected to do no more than glare at you silently. She also made a personal comment (possibly two), another faux pas. And insinuated herself into a family issue, whatever it was, with her comment about \"fault\". Oh, and telling an adult, with whom she has no parental relationship, to do something? Another strike.\n\nYou, on the other hand, in removing yourself from an unpleasant situation, behaved perfectly.   NTA. Sounds like a cute outfit, too.\n\nBut, really, you can't eat with cloth gloves on; it's unsanitary and gloves are nearly impossible to clean. Could you wear disposable gloves to eat?", "NTA might be just morbid curiosity on her part.  Or ghoulish interest.
