When you\u2019re in a caregiving field people know that you are empathetic and care deeply for others and will use that to their advantage.

He needs to communicate that he won\u2019t be home till later. I dealt with this with my mom\u2019s friend. She\u2019d gone out for drinks and said she\u2019d be home around 11. They didn\u2019t show up till 6 pm the next night. I was pissed. I had no idea where they were and they didn\u2019t give me any contact information. And when they finally came to get their kids they paid me 20 bucks. They\u2019d gotten so drunk that they went home and slept. My mom was with them as well. I wasn\u2019t happy and I didn\u2019t want to babysit again considering they expected it for free after that.", "Thank you! They have been a good client so I felt bad but I\u2019ve had families pay me a late fee without me asking and they were only 15 min later than planned so I didn\u2019t know if they were just being kind or if it was normal. I really appreciate your insight!", "That\u2019s what I texted him after. If I had known in advance it would have been a ok. I just need to know so I can plan accordingly.", "This doesn\u2019t make any sense. He texts after he\u2019s already late asking if she can be flexible. She says no. He turns up another half hour later. And somehow she\u2019s also in the wrong for not divining that he was going to ignore her lack of flexibility and not asking him for more details on that?", "did he pay ya for the extra time? If not then NTA", "You don't say why he was late. If he was just having a good time that he didn't want to cut short, then he deserves the late fee and your warning that this cannot happen again. But if it was something that just occurred that he couldn't avoid (e.g., he had a flat or other car trouble, there was a traffic jam...), then you can still ask for a late fee but also recognize that he was not willfully disregarding your time.", "My bad! I read it wrong! I need some sleep.", "Even of he did she was still NTA. You can t force someone to do overtime. Proper notice is needed and if soemone says they can't then that s it.\n\n He didn't even call and say'sorry I had an emergency can you stay'. He said 'oh can you be more flexible' and then didnt even update it would be 45 minutes. \n\nIf i was at work until 10 and made plans for 10:30 I would not be happy to only get to leave at 10:45. Even if they have been good clients so far it s important to establish good communication and I feel op did that by saying it wasn t even the time, it was the lack of notice and poor communication about how long it would be.", "NTA 45 mins is a long amount of overtime work and he didn\u2019t even warn you until 15 mins past the time you were supposed to leave. Your time should still be respected. It may have been a one off but I\u2019d think carefully about working for him in future", "NTA. He needs to respect your time, which he doesn't. If he asks you to babysit until 10 he needs to be back at 10. \n\nIf he hasn't done this other times it's probably fine; if he has done this before you need to either charge him double for the late portion or stop babysitting for him.", "NTA. contract violation", "NTA. If you want to try to extend the babysitting session you do it before you\u2019re already late. Not being able to make it home on time if you get a no is just disrespectful. People have lives beyond the things they\u2019re paid to do.", "NTA - I babysat a lot in my younger years and quickly learned who respected my time and who didn't. Those who didn't were no longer on my babysitting roster, plain and simple. Finding a good, reliable sitter is difficult and I was well aware of that. I wasn't going to work with people who didn't give me the most basic level of respect.\n\nSo, proceed as you see fit, but realize if he does it once, he'll probably do it again (at least that has been my experience).", "NTA. Start implementing a late fee as standard. Say $10-$15 per 15 minutes or part thereof. When they are paying extra, they become less willing to be late. Be aware that when someone asks if you can stay late, they aren't really asking, they've already decided they're not coming back on time", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nWhy would you soften the blow?? He disrespected you. Did he pay you for the extra time? It doesn't matter how you planned to spend your time - it's your time.", "at least he was in touch. once had a parent be 3 hours late and unreachable by cell. i almost called police", "NTA you should never cut anyone any slack ever.\n\nGreat kids and good pay but he was 45 mins late once. He deserves everything he gets - it's unbelievably bad behaviour from him.\n\nIs this the reassurance you're looking for?", "Esh sheesh this is job", "NTA, but still...\n\nHere's one for you:\n\nMy eldest two (twins) were still very young and my wife and I wanted to go out. We arranged a sitter and scheduled to be home around 1AM. We went out for dinner and drinks, and met a couple of nice people that I shouted rounds for. Well one of them thought it'd be funny to either drug my wife, or me so that he could play the hero. He chose me. I ended up on the floor after a few drinks, highly unlike me, and proceeded to have a breakdown because of the affects the drug had on me. Here he is trying to take my wife to somewhere safe, LOL, and me on the floor with the cops getting ready to haul my arse off to the drunk tank, which they did. Oh, just a note, this was before mobile/cell phones were everywhere. So while this dude is trying to get into my wife's pants, she's having to call the sitter and explain everything that's going on. \n\nMy wife bailed me out of the drunk tank and got us home around 5AM. We felt so sorry for what we did to that poor sitter, but at the same time it wasn't our fault. I ended up in the ER later the next (same?) day still reeling from the affects of the date rape drug. \n\nWe got lucky that the sitter agreed to stay, she was only 16, and she got her mother to come help considering the tardiness of our return. We paid her double the hourly rate we agreed upon for her troubles. And to this day I still suffer from breakdowns about once a year, sometimes every two if I'm lucky.\n\nMoral of the story? Bare with the parent(s), you don't know what they're going through or why they may be running late. Even with mobile/cell phones everywhere today, they may be caught up in something outside their control and can't call.", "YTA , 10:45 come on!", "If he doesn't do it regularly and this was a once off, maybe cut him some slack.", "NTA, but I feel for the father. He is obviously trying to date, and having what amounts to a curfew at 30, 40 years old must suck.", "Wow things have changed since I was a kid. I babysat several families and I took whatever money they gave me and would babysit til whenever they got home (Usually 1am-2am)", "Esh. Did you communicate to dad ahead of time that you needed him home at a certain time?", "I don't think you're an AH but I think you're overreacting. It's unreasonable for him to ask you to stay on. What the problem here is a break in comms. You assumed 10 minutes. He probably didn't think an extension would be an issue. You should be in touch with him to say that in future you can't accommodate so much time past the agreed time on short notice.  He needs to stick to the agreed times.", "Really don't think 45 minutes is a big deal when babysitting...?", "oh no 45 min, call the white house!", "Maybe the poor guy got lucky. it sounds like he needs it. But should have apologised immediately and offered more money to you, but you wanted to party (your 19 I get it). I wouldn't worry tho because I doubt he will want you to babysit again with your outburst.", "Charge him extra. Charge him three times as much for the 45 minutes and call it a late fee.

Presumably he gets a good, attentive babysitter for that. He needs to respect your time.", "NTA I hope you got paid for that extra time.", "NTA; he prioritized his time over yours, that's a lack of consideration on his part", "The time to ask how flexible you can be on time is before he heads out for the night.", "With the understanding that things can happen. I'm not talking about the parents just staying at a party, but get caught in a traffic jam caused by a crash is something that can happen. The sitter would deserve to be paid of the over time but its something that can happen without warning.\n\nEdit \n\nFixed an autocorrupt", "They stayed out all night and didn\u2019t show up until the following evening? That\u2019s when you call child services.", "I\u2019ve been paid \u00a320 for a few hrs of babysitting\u2026", "I think you need to add /s", "I absolutely understand if something happens! I\u2019ve been in situations and it is just never predictable. I think what got me was when he got home he didn\u2019t have anything to say. If there had been a reason for him being late, even if I was already upset for him being late I would have 100% more understanding. Thank you for sharing this story it definitely puts things in perspective if something like this happens again in the future", "That curfew can be determined by yourself as an adult. That's the difference. When I was babysitting, the different parents always made sure to plan ahead if they wanted an open curfew and we arranged for me to sleep over. With an overnight fee. That way they didn't have to watch the time.", "Just because you were a pushover doesn\u2019t mean everyone else is", "There was no outburst and they were reasonably annoyed.", ">I wouldn't worry tho because I doubt he will want you to babysit again with your outburst\n\n\n\nWhat outburst? \n\nAsking for basic respect? \n\nNo matter what her plan for her time was, it should be respected. Respect cuts both ways.", "Charging per minute might be over the top but it's standard practice across all types of employment that over time is time and a half. If your payed for example 10 an hour it's not unreasonable to round up to the nearest hour and expect 15 extra for the what he did.\n\nNow your worth and don't settle for less. NTA", "Your autocorrect is corrupted..Lol. \ud83e\udd23", "Of course. Sometimes it's no big deal to stay a few extra hours and sometimes the babysitter has a job or other obligations that require them to leave no later than a certain time. It's bad etiquette to call at the last minute if there's no emergency and a deal breaker when there's no call at all. \n\nAnd autocorrupt sucks.", "Or, just set up a time in advance. I babysat a lot in my teenage years. There were some families who were home at 11pm sharp every time I babysat. Others wanted me to stay the night, or would come home at 2am. As long as I knew in advance and they did what they said they were going to do, I was fine with it.", "I wasn't a pushover. That's how it worked where I lived for all babysitters. All I said things have changed since I was a babysitter", "It's common in childcare settings. My kids daycare has the same policy.", "Maybe he hit it off with a lady, and it just went on a little longer than anticipated. Finding the best time to message without ruining the moment is a judgement call. OP says herself he doesn't get out much. Bet she doesn't get much more babysitting from him.", "No,  that was intentional. Lol", "Those are people with professional qualifications, people who went to college. Got an education in child care and run a business with business costs. A teenage babysitter has more incommen with a minimum wage employee. And the rules that most people get about time and a half seam like they are closer tithe mark. at least that's how I see it.", "No. Finding out what your hard time limit is takes priority. You do that before you find out how far that moment goes, because *he is a parent*.\nHis sex life isn't her responsibility, watching the kids for an agreed upon amount of time is, and \"I didn't climax fast enough\" isn't a legit reason to be late if you don't know there's flexibility. \n\nIt isn't hard to say \"probably ten, but is there flexibility of the date is going well and we want to keep talking?\" ... sometimes there is. Sometimes there isn't. And that's life.", "Ok..then.  It was funny... you got me fooled !", "That might be but op is still worthy of respect and not to be taken advantage of.\n\n The deal was to babysit till 10pmm not 11pm . maybe op would have said no to babysitting that day if they would have said 11pm from the beginning. \n\nYou don't just unilaterally change the time returning home in these cases .\n\nNTA", "Ate something I picked up from somewhere probably a discord group. But you can't call it autocorrected when it was correct before and the changincorrupted the sentence. Yeah so we just started calling it autocorrupted", "No one is disagreeing with that point. All we are discussing is how much compensation OP should charge after a parent is late. \nAlso you need to remember that the child care charging per the minute is probably also having to pay at least two members of staff to stay and wait and is having to keep the lights and heating in the building on. It is responsible that the parent has to cover all of that cost. When it's a teenager in the parents own house time and a half on their hourly rate sounds closer to the mark to me.\n\nNo-one is saying that what the parent did was right, book the time your going to need, and if something unavoidable happens (like getting stuck in traffic for an hour) it's on them to communicate that to the sitter ASAP", "Completely agree with this."]}
