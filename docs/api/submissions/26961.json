There\u2019s a reason he didn\u2019t say anything, and it\u2019s because he already knew he was in the wrong and didn\u2019t want to own up to it. \n\nIn the future, don\u2019t try to soften the blow. When you\u2019re in a caregiving field people know that you are empathetic and care deeply for others and will use that to their advantage. You are never responsible for managing the emotions of someone who has wronged you. He might feel guilty? Good, he should feel guilty for putting you in that position. Let him manage that on his own.\n\nEdit: you should also be charging a late fee. I do a max of 10 minutes grace period, and then it\u2019s $1-$2 per minute over. Obviously babysitting and nannying are very different. But either way your time matters and you\u2019re in that home in a professional capacity, not personal.", "Nta. The time to ask about your flexibility was before he hit the deadline, not after.", "NTA\nI've been on both sides of this particular kind of situation.\n\nParents who want to keep a babysitter need to learn to abide by the agreed return time unless the possibility of being late (with additional compensation) is agreed to in advance.", "NTA\n\nThe time to ask how flexible you can be on time is before he heads out for the night, preferably when he calls you to ask you to babysit.\n\nYou couldn't have left the kids so by waiting until the end of the night be basically coerced you into staying however late he wanted.", "NTA! And so rude of him to ask that when he was already late home to begin with! I hope you charged him extra! You deserve it!", "EDIT: NTA\n\nI hope he paid you double time for that overtime.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He needs to communicate that he won\u2019t be home till later. I dealt with this with my mom\u2019s friend. She\u2019d gone out for drinks and said she\u2019d be home around 11. They didn\u2019t show up till 6 pm the next night. I was pissed. I had no idea where they were and they didn\u2019t give me any contact information. And when they finally came to get their kids they paid me 20 bucks. They\u2019d gotten so drunk that they went home and slept. My mom was with them as well. I wasn\u2019t happy and I didn\u2019t want to babysit again considering they expected it for free after that.", "Thank you! They have been a good client so I felt bad but I\u2019ve had families pay me a late fee without me asking and they were only 15 min later than planned so I didn\u2019t know if they were just being kind or if it was normal. I really appreciate your insight!", "That\u2019s what I texted him after. If I had known in advance it would have been a ok. I just need to know so I can plan accordingly.", "This doesn\u2019t make any sense. He texts after he\u2019s already late asking if she can be flexible. She says no. He turns up another half hour later. And somehow she\u2019s also in the wrong for not divining that he was going to ignore her lack of flexibility and not asking him for more details on that?", "did he pay ya for the extra time? If not then NTA", "You don't say why he was late. If he was just having a good time that he didn't want to cut short, then he deserves the late fee and your warning that this cannot happen again. But if it was something that just occurred that he couldn't avoid (e.g., he had a flat or other car trouble, there was a traffic jam...), then you can still ask for a late fee but also recognize that he was not willfully disregarding your time.", "My bad! I read it wrong! I need some sleep.", "Even of he did she was still NTA. You can t force someone to do overtime. Proper notice is needed and if soemone says they can't then that s it.\n\n He didn't even call and say'sorry I had an emergency can you stay'. He said 'oh can you be more flexible' and then didnt even update it would be 45 minutes. \n\nIf i was at work until 10 and made plans for 10:30 I would not be happy to only get to leave at 10:45. Even if they have been good clients so far it s important to establish good communication and I feel op did that by saying it wasn t even the time, it was the lack of notice and poor communication about how long it would be."]}
