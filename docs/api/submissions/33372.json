But it seems to be a difficult situation for your nephew - while he could know better at his age, you could probably cut him some slack when it comes to situations with his mostly-absent father.", "NTA But like... this kid can't win.\n\nThis is a 16yo who has been abandoned by his father, it's only natural that he wants his approval. His dad decided to make it such that he'd only accept him if he disrespected you. This puts him in a really difficult situation, where he has to decide between someone he does respect, and someone that he desperately wants the approval of. At the end of it, the reason he chose to disrespect you is probably because you're the reliable one: he knows you're not just going to ditch him if you don't like one thing he did.\n\nRemember, your nephew is not TA here either, he's a kid with a shitty dad. Your brother is the real asshole here, hopefully he learns his lesson about trying to pit his kid against you for whatever ego boost it gives him and puts his kid first.", "NTA. You were told by the father \ud83d\ude44 and the child that u were also a child so you have no responsibility to buy him a gift. Would your nephew buy you one or would he be exempt because of his age? The same rules apply if you\u2019re in the same category. He doesn\u2019t like it? Then he should respect you as his uncle.", "Nta 16 is old enough he knows what he did and can understand why he didn\u2019t get a gift. I would try to have a convo with him again. He probably wanted to impress his dad. \n\nIt\u2019s sad but kids get weird when the parent that abandoned them show affection. It\u2019s like a drug and they will do anything to get it.", "INFO: what culture is this?", "NTA", "I agree with the ESH people. You are the adult here at almost 30. Your nephew probably has abandonment issues tied to your brother and will likely do anything to please him and gain his approval in the small window of time he\u2019s with him. The situation just makes me sad.\n\nMaybe you should take the kid out for some one-on-one time and talk about the deeper issues here. 16 year olds are selfish and shortsighted and dumb. They can\u2019t always (or usually) work through complication situations and emotions by themselves.\n\nThe only real AH here is your brother.", "NTA \n\nHe may only be saying these things because he desperately wants his dad to like and want him, but actions have consequences and he is mature enough to work out who will support him and who is a deadbeat dad.", "I grew up in a family where elders were called \"Auntie\" or \"Uncle\" and FULL FIRST NAME after. Auntie Charlotte, Uncle Anthony, all that stuff. Once I turned 18 (legally an adult, can vote, drink/buy cigs in certain provinces) I started calling my Aunties and Uncles shortened versions of their name - \"Auntie Charlie, Uncle Tony\". They didn't blink an eye at it, and my parents raised shit. \"It's disrespectful, you call them by their Given Name\"...until I started calling them by their given names. \"Martha, MARTHA. MAAARRRTHA good lord MARTHA MOTHER MARTHA\" She didn't like that at all, Auntie Charlie and Uncle Tony just laughed at it. They allowed me to call them the more informal version of their name, it was my mother who had a conniption about it. \n\nWhat your brother is saying is his child doesn't have any agency over what they want, even though they're close to being an adult. He's also saying you don't have any agency over how you like to be addressed. You're just a NPC in his world and the fact that you're not doing what he wants is pissing him off.", "I cannot stand this elder \u201csir and ma\u2019am\u201d belief in the few remaining cultures. Forcing children into compliance due to someone\u2019s age isn\u2019t respect. You come off arrogant and entitled. YTA.", "NTA - seems like the father could do with some basic respect and decency himself.", " I'm leaning towards ESH. Minus the nephew.\n\nThe dad/brother is trying to assert authority with his son when he has no grounds to really do so at this point. He kept on didn't let up until his son listened to him. He purposely put his kid into an awkward situation. He's the biggest AH. \n\nI get why you did it but you missed the chance to make it into an actual learning moment. You helped put the kid in a no win situation. You could have spoken to him in private and explained that you have done a lot for him and listening to his dad who hasn't been around over you is hurtful. That not treating you as an elder is hurtful in your culture when you have helped take care of him. The short conversation you had with him wasn't a productive one to get your feelings across and make a point before choosing to withdraw your gifts. \n\nThe nephew probably wants his dad approval and is trying to gain his favour and feels a little lost. He was in a no win situation here: Listening to his dad would make you mad. Listening to you would make his dad mad. But you focused on being respected over analyzing the situation from your nephews point of view.", "I think this should have been posted under r/pettyrevenge.\n\nWith the accent on the petty.", "Sure culture is what you call it...I'm American and from an Army Brat household and had to deal with this nonsense.

Going against the grain YTA, your home sounds so warm and welcoming \ud83d\ude44", "NTA", "NTA", "Lmao oh no the kid only a decade younger than me called me by my name instead of sir, no gifts for him! /s\nEw your brother is right, you are barely old enough to put on your own shirt", "ESH. You sound like a arrogant prick who demands respect whether you've earned it or not. And decide to punish your nephew by not only not giving him gifts, but keeping them for your own use.\n\nSolely because his asshole of an absent father, who he's probably desperate to please and try and build some relationship with; called you out on your self important bullshit.\n\nYour poor, poor nephew.", "NTA petty? Yes. But not an AH.", "ESH", "NTA. That kid is old enough for consequences for disrespecting you.", "This is silly and childish. Your brother is screwing with a kid\u2019s head. The kid doesn\u2019t know who to listen to. Then you take away his gift for doing what he was told to do. You and your bro YTA", "NTA", "YTA\n\nYour gift your choice.\n\nYour nephew did call you by the formal \"sir\" though and his father told him not to. Which means according to the formal culture he is listening to his father the way he is supposed to do so. So you punished him instead of your brother for this? That part does not make sense to me. In your formal culture doesn't the rules of the father supersede the requests of the uncle?  And if he listened to you instead isn't that considered not showing his father respect due to him because of this highly formal culture? Seems quite contradictory to me.\n\nMy nieces and nephews never called me by a title so I do not really understand the formal culture you are speaking of. They called me by my first name and the relationship is very casual instead of the very formal \"sir and ma'am\" type of relationship. We are that way with my father's siblings as well (we do not call them by titles). We are all family and get along  (even with different viewpoints) but no titles are involved.", "Do you only buy him gifts because he respected you? How about buying him gifts because, you know, he's part of the family and you love him? I agree that this kid made a mistake in listening to his dad, but he's just a kid! With an estranged father. Be a grown-up. You're so petty.\n\nYTA", "ESH", "Yes you are the asshole. Not sure what culture your from but. This seems like you went on a little power trip. Respect for elders is earned because of their wisdom not age. Examine why you respect the people you do and model them. You should have a discussion with your brother and tell him you were foolish. Admission of fault is an admirable trait.", "NTA, but petty. The boy has a poor excuse for a father, consider being the better person as a role model.", "NTA", "NTA.
