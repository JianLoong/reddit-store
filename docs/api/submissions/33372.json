His dad decided to make it such that he'd only accept him if he disrespected you. This puts him in a really difficult situation, where he has to decide between someone he does respect, and someone that he desperately wants the approval of. At the end of it, the reason he chose to disrespect you is probably because you're the reliable one: he knows you're not just going to ditch him if you don't like one thing he did.\n\nRemember, your nephew is not TA here either, he's a kid with a shitty dad. Your brother is the real asshole here, hopefully he learns his lesson about trying to pit his kid against you for whatever ego boost it gives him and puts his kid first.", "NTA. You were told by the father \ud83d\ude44 and the child that u were also a child so you have no responsibility to buy him a gift.

Your nephew probably has abandonment issues tied to your brother and will likely do anything to please him and gain his approval in the small window of time he\u2019s with him. The situation just makes me sad.\n\nMaybe you should take the kid out for some one-on-one time and talk about the deeper issues here. 16 year olds are selfish and shortsighted and dumb.

Auntie Charlotte, Uncle Anthony, all that stuff. Once I turned 18 (legally an adult, can vote, drink/buy cigs in certain provinces) I started calling my Aunties and Uncles shortened versions of their name - \"Auntie Charlie, Uncle Tony\". They didn't blink an eye at it, and my parents raised shit. \"It's disrespectful, you call them by their Given Name\"...until I started calling them by their given names. \"Martha, MARTHA. MAAARRRTHA good lord MARTHA MOTHER MARTHA\" She didn't like that at all, Auntie Charlie and Uncle Tony just laughed at it. They allowed me to call them the more informal version of their name, it was my mother who had a conniption about it.\n\nWhat your brother is saying is his child doesn't have any agency over what they want, even though they're close to being an adult.

He purposely put his kid into an awkward situation. He's the biggest AH. \n\nI get why you did it but you missed the chance to make it into an actual learning moment. You helped put the kid in a no win situation. You could have spoken to him in private and explained that you have done a lot for him and listening to his dad who hasn't been around over you is hurtful. That not treating you as an elder is hurtful in your culture when you have helped take care of him. The short conversation you had with him wasn't a productive one to get your feelings across and make a point before choosing to withdraw your gifts. \n\nThe nephew probably wants his dad approval and is trying to gain his favour and feels a little lost. He was in a no win situation here: Listening to his dad would make you mad. Listening to you would make his dad mad.

In your formal culture doesn't the rules of the father supersede the requests of the uncle?  And if he listened to you instead isn't that considered not showing his father respect due to him because of this highly formal culture? Seems quite contradictory to me.\n\nMy nieces and nephews never called me by a title so I do not really understand the formal culture you are speaking of.

That would have been the teaching and nurturing thing to do. That's what true elders do that makes it so they earn respect. The irony is that his brother told his son not to respect his uncle because he's a baby, and OP acted like it. Doesn't make his brother not an AH but he stumbled onto a point. Instead, OP had anger at his brother and displaced it disproportionately on his nephew, the easy target. That's why OP told the brother he kept the gift. Which is punching down, like his brother tries to do with him. But hey, if he just wants to write off his nephew as ungrateful, maybe he doesn\u2019t really care to have a relationship with him.
