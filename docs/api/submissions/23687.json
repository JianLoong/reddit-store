Sorry!\n\nI have never had a great relationship with my parents. They never quite liked me as much as my older brother and sister.  From little things such as not getting the dinner I wanted on my birthday while my siblings got extravagant parties or my mother saying I wasn't as pretty as my sister, to bigger things such as excluding me from a family vacation due to my being sick. I was not sick, I had a slight headache and my mother insisted it was best I stay home alone from our week long trip.  I was 18 when that happened and used to the treatment and so simply went along with it while my parents and siblings left for the trip.\n\nOnce I turned 19 I moved away for college. It's worth mentioning my parents paid for my siblings schooling, both private school and college, while I went to public and they informed me they would not pay for my college right before I graduated. I ended up dropping out a year in as I had not saved up money for college and was scared of going into debt. My parents informed me I was a disgrace and they were disappointed in me, which I decided was the last straw and decreased my communications with them. I still spoke to them on occasions, but never went back for holidays or get togethers, and have not seen them sense I left school.\n\nWell I got engaged last year, married a few days ago. I originally didn't plan to invite my parents, but after speaking to my siblings was convinced to to not cause extra problems. Well, at my wedding my parents were talking to my cousins when I walked up to the group. I overheard my parents informing them I dropped out due to not being able to handle college, and that it was just too hard for me. When I denied this, informing them I could not afford it my parents got real flushed and said that of course they offered to pay and that I shouldn't say such things. I don't know why, but this particular thing broke me. I realized just how much my parents didn't care for me, and I asked them to leave. I didn't make a scene of it, just quietly told them to go. They refused at first, but I asked security to quietly walk them out so they left. Despite the quickness of the whole thing, many others found out, and about half of my family ended up leaving, my sister included.\n\nI've gotten tons of hate from the family who left over the last couple days, most of whom telling me I shouldn't have disgraced my parents by having them escorted out. I get I may have overreacted, I knew what I was getting into when I invited them so I should have expected something like this and ignored it. But also, it was my wedding, and I feel like I shouldn't have had to deal with it. My husband agrees with me, and didn't want my parents there to begin with, but still, I'm not sure.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1690935565, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ftj3z/aita_for_not_inviting_my_24f_parents_50m49f_to_my/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

These are the type of parents that no contact is for. Next time don\u2019t let your siblings talk you in to something that you don\u2019t want to do. You knew this would happen.  Please remember this if you decide to have children as it will be another pressure point.", "NTA. It's really gross they lied and said you dropped out of college because you found it \"too hard\" instead of admitting they didn't support you financially like they did their other kids. They shouldn't have ever brought up you dropping out of college on your wedding day in the first place. \n\nI'm sorry that happened on your special day", "NTA. How dare they gaslight and talk down on you at your own wedding!! You asked them to leave and they had the opportunity to do so on their own and not be embarrassed, which is a kindness they didn\u2019t deserve after embarrassing you to multiple family members and lying about you to them ON YOUR WEDDING DAY! Who knows who else they talked to and what they said before you walked up. Your sister doesn\u2019t understand cause she\u2019s never had to yearn for their love, acceptance, and support. I\u2019m sorry you have such shitty parents. My in laws were really shitty to me at my wedding, so I know how upsetting and devastating it is to have your wedding day overshadowed by people who didn\u2019t deserve to be there in the first place. I hope the rest of your day was absolutely beautiful and amazing and I hope you have a beautiful life with your new husband! Welcome to the wife life!", "I don't think you overreacted, and their words demonstrate that they are aware they mistreated you and don't like other people knowing it. Here's your reply to your haters:\n\nAt my wedding, my parents reminded me of the fact that do not count me among their real children and, as they have done my entire life, they denigrated and undervalued me. Having finally realized that they do not love or value me and never have or will, I decided that I could no longer stomach their presence at a gathering meant to celebrate me and my husband's joy and asked them to leave. Those of you who are angry on my their behalf, know that you have been lied to about how I was raised and how they treated me, just as they continued to lie about me at my wedding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd then block and cut off anybody who continues to attack you. You deserve better. ETA: NTA", "NTA they are unsupportive and just terrible parents off of what you\u2019ve said. You don\u2019t owe these people anything at all they know what they\u2019ve done and don\u2019t deserve to be at one of your happiest moments if this is the behavior they\u2019ve shown. If anything maybe have a sit down with your siblings and explain to them why you did what you did, from their perspective you just look like an asshole that kicked out your own parents on a big event.", "NTA. Do I really need to tell you this? They were mean spirited, unsupportive parents and they lied about you at your own wedding! They deserved the perp walk. I hope you embarrassed the crap out of them! I\u2019m guessing that they also didn\u2019t contribute a penny toward the wedding. Feel free to cut them out of your life without any guilt whatsoever. Above all, if you choose to have children, please do not expose them to these people!\nDo you look like your siblings? I would have your DNA tested. You may get a pleasant surprise.", "NTA - I'm sorry this happened to you", "**NTA**   Write a boilerplate letter that outlines everything you wrote here -- all of the favoritism over the years and being treated like a second-class child.  Tell them that your parents lying at your wedding about the reason you had to drop out of school was the very last straw.  Then block them all.\n\nYour next step should be to look into therapy to understand why having these people -- your parents, your siblings, and the relatives who left -- will never contribute anything positive to your life.\n\nWhile you are looking into therapy, do a bit of reading about the narcissistic family dynamic and covert passive-aggressive narcissism (Debi Mirza has a good starter book).   Do not let these people back into your life.", "NTA: except to the extent that you thought somehow this time would be different, you did everything right.", "NTA. You really shouldn\u2019t have invited them, but now you know that they will throw you under a bus to save their reputation so people don\u2019t know the truth.

Your husband was right in not wanting them at your wedding.\n\nIt sounds like they are narcissists and you were their scape goat.\n\nWhen they left the wedding, their flying monkeys went with them.\n\nYou don't owe them anything.

Your sister enables their behaviour because it benefits her.", "NTA - Your parents are narcissists. As the \"golden child\" of my family, let me tell you that it is possible for golden children to see and try to support the sibling who is being abused. And it was abuse. They were actively trying to set you up to fail before, and then they all did it again at your wedding because that's the only thing they know how to do. It is your whole family, not just your parents. I'm sorry if I'm overstepping here. You 100% deserve to only talk to the people who will make you feel loved and whole. It is completely understandable why you kicked them out.", "I honestly don't know how the topic came up, I didn't ask. Thank you!", "Thank you! It was, I had an absolutely amazing day! I'm sorry your wedding had a unpleasant spot as well, I hope it went great otherwise! And thanks! I'm excited! :D", "Thank you! I haven't responded to most of my messages, but something along those lines would probably be best. I'm planning to not do anything until I get back from my honeymoon, but it's been stressing me so I wanted outside help.", "Thank you. I have talked to my siblings about it in the past. My brother understands and doesn't have that much contact with my parents either. My sister doesn't really care though, she just doesn't want extra drama and so goes along with whatever my parents say.", "Honestly I don't look like my siblings all that much. We have the same hair color and eye color, but that's about it. I've always assumed that the reason my parents didn't like me as much as my siblings was because I wasn't what is considered traditionally pretty.  My parents and siblings are incredibly attractive, even as family I can see that. I am not slightly attractive in societies standards, but I don't mind that. My husband likes my looks ;) \n\nAnd thank you!", "Thank you! I haven't responded to anyone yet, but I don't plan to until I get back from my honeymoon. I just am getting myself worked up about it and so wanted outside opinions. I do want to look into therapy. My brother though understands my side and hasn't had that much contact with my parents sense he began to see how I was treated. I don't think I worded it right in the post, my brother is completely on my side and is almost more furious with my parents than I am currently.", "I know, I should have known better. I just hoped they would put things aside on my wedding day. Thank you.", "OP, this is a harsh way to learn this lesson- but your whole family- including your siblings- are toxic and expect you to be a doormat. While your parents have been horrible, I don't see your siblings doing anything to support you or stand up for you either. \n\nDon't. You've done nothing wrong. Block all of them. They have not been a family anyway to you- why do you need to stay in contact?\n\nNTA. \n\nMake your own family, live your life on your own terms and be happy. All the best for your new life.", "Here's my best help: turn off your phone and enjoy your honeymoon. Give no more fucks to them.", "Well now you know for sure that they will never change. Move forward without them or anyone else who is enabling them. I hope your husband has a good family. I live far from my parents and near my wife's family, in which I am fully a part of the family and that's a great thing since I don't see.my parents often (my parents were always quite supportive, they just live far away, so it's a bit more indirect support)."]}
