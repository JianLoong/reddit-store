She steals, lies, manipulates, and occasionally gets aggressive. We know she finds partners for both real and digital activity online. We've tried everything- therapists, psychiatrists, hospitals, mental health programs, new schools, police, and of course doing our best to be supportive through it all.\n\nWe had a recent argument about her not doing anything at home- no work, school, or chores, and that she needed to start showing respect and helping with chores. She said she'd rather move out than deal with that, packed 3 bags, and left. I told her the door was open whenever she decided to help with chores and respect us.\n\nShe moved into a motel with a guy (10 years older) and girl she met online 4 days prior. She hadn't asked to come home, only for more clothes and meds. Since then, I found out that-\n\n-she is telling everyone she was kicked out\n\n-she gave a complete stranger online money, her SSN, and photo of her license because that person said they need help opening an account and would pay her back.\n\n-she stole her brother's money a month prior (i found the empty card hidden in her room).\n\nShe finally admitted that the 3 of them were kicked from the motel and the girls hang out while he works, then all 3 ride subways overnight, even though it happened a few days before. I suggested she look for shelters, hang out at the local library during the day, or call the trade school that offered housing and pay that had already accepted her (she refuses to leave her new friends). But I told her that since I found the stolen money and proof of illegal activities, the offer to come back when she did chores and respected us was gone. \n\nI was told it's wrong to let your kid struggle and risk great harm. I feel like it is, but I'm finally experiencing peace for the first time in years. \n\nLike i said, she isn't asking to come home yet.

I'm not sure what other people expect you could possibly do more of than you've already done. You cannot force your adult child to come home and live under your rules if she doesn't want to. You cannot force your adult child to accept your help or suggestions either. The only thing you can do at this point is let go and let her figure out her life which is what it sounds like she wants to do.", "Probably NTA\n\nIt's a very tricky grey area when it comes to your own kids. You want them to be safe and well, you want then to suceed in life--but you can't make them do it if they're determined to fuck up. Some people *only* learn by making mistakes.\n\nShe chose to leave when you asked her to do chores (not even \"get a job\" just *chores*!). You're now choosing not to let her back due to her behavior. You know she'd lie about you, you know she'd steal from you. She hasn't changed significantly enough in a few months to be given another chance yet.", "Personally, I think this is tough love. It sounds like you've extended every olive branch possible, but she's determined to run her life into the ground. At some point, you have to let her sink or swim on her own. We might not always agree with our kids' life choices, but the best way for them to learn is to try and fail. That's how we, as parents, know anything about anything, right? Life experience. And the bottom line is you can't have an adult in your home who is stealing and partaking in nefarious activities. I think you're doing the right thing by being available to talk to, but also rescinding financial help and shelter. Be kind so she knows she can count on you when she is in unsafe or abusive situations--you don't want to push her away in that regard, but keep maintaining your boundaries. Your peace matters too. NTA.", "Maybe is the best judgement I can give here.\n\nWhen people say we tried everything.  Sometimes that's true.  Sometimes it's far from the truth.

You tried your best and that\u2019s all you can really do.", "NTA -   She does not want your help right now.  She can live however she wants to live.   But she is on a slippery slope to addiction if she's not there already and if you are worried about her safety and what you should do if/when she becomes desperate and comes back to you for help, then you may find some substance dependence resources focusing on family/friends of addicts that could help you learn to maintain your boundaries while keeping yourselves safe.   There is a fine line between harm reduction and enabling.  You can still do things like buy her food, or help her pay for treatment or a cheap phone so if she's ever in an emergency she can call you.   But access to your home and other things she can steal and take advantage of would be off limits.   I don't envy you.", "NTA. You tried your best and supported her as well as you could, but she is a legal adult now and has responsibility for her actions. If she is stealing from her brother, she won't respect anyone's property if she is ever welcomed back.", "NTA. You can't help those that don't want it.", "NTA.\n\nShe's not a kid, she's where she is choosing to be and doing what she's choosing to do. At some point we have to accept our adult sons and daughters are responsible for their choices and the outcomes. We can't control them or keep a safety net around them. \n\nYou could make hard boundaries on what is and isn't acceptable over the things you can control, like your home, then stick to those. If she respected those then there likely wouldn't be a problem for you. If she doesn't want to then she won't want to come live with you again-as long as you are following through on putting your foot down.\n\nYou don't say what mental illness she has but if she's a danger to herself or other's you could report that. She's wanting to take her meds so it doesn't sound like she's off the rails with that issue. I'd give her the meds and whatever she owns but I wouldn't enable her current lifestyle.\n\nUltimately this is really beyond what randoms like myself on the internet can give a call on or people that haven't been in your situation.

They bash me on social media and tell everyone that I kicked them out and that I don\u2019t care about them.

It's understandable that you have reached a breaking point and need to prioritize your own well-being and the well-being of your family. It's also important to hold her accountable for her actions, particularly if they involve illegal or dangerous behavior. You have suggested alternative options for her and it's ultimately up to her to decide whether to accept them.", "NTA - Sounds like she\u2019s not in a place where she wants to accept help or actually make a change. There\u2019s only so much a person can do.", "Absent missing information on why she's acting like this, NTA. Much as you wish to help her, not much you can do until she wants to help herself. Until she shows that she's willing to change don't let her return.", "Your daughter has a debilitating illness, has been ill for years, and yet you seem to be expecting her to function in a way that's deemed 'normal'. Some or most of her risky behaviours could be attributable to her illness-- and she might be hanging with risky people because they represent freedom, they accept her as she is without putting conditions on her, and she isn't labelled as 'the mentally ill/difficult one/the screw-up'.\n\nHaving a mental illness is physically exhausting. At my most severe, I couldn't function beyond doing the absolute bare minimum. It felt like I spent every day wading through quicksand, everything took such monumental effort that I did almost nothing. I physically couldn't do any more. So expecting your daughter to work, do chores, schoolwork, or other things that sap the little energy she has, might have been unrealistic on your part. It seems you're expecting her to function at a level that perhaps she simply can't. \n\nThat's not laziness. When she told you she'd rather leave than deal with all the things you expect from her, maybe that was because those things are too much for her to deal with, physically, emotionally and mentally.\n\nMaybe she's decided to leave because the way she sees it, you've been on her case for too long. Your support might have looked very different to her. She might have felt that your treatment of her was harsh, or that you resented her or were punishing her for being ill.\n\nI wouldn't close the door on her entirely. When she's ready to get proper help she probably will, but that may take a long time. You have to remember that this isn't a case of an unruly child deciding to be naughty for the hell of it. Your child has a mental health disability. How would you treat a child who was physically disabled? Would you expect the same level of energy and output from them as you would a nondisabled person? \n\nI'm saying NAH. You're in a difficult situation, and so is your daughter. She doesn't want to be ill, no one does, and if you've been treating her like she's doing things deliberately or wilfully when it might be the illness driving at least some of her behaviours, she's of course going to want to get away from you, especially if you were trying to lay conditions that that she found too hard for her to meet.", "I dont know how this happens but i\u2019ve seen it and its one of my biggest fears in life for one of the kids or niblings ending up so far off the rails.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"-she is telling everyone she was kicked out\" ..
