She steals, lies, manipulates, and occasionally gets aggressive. We know she finds partners for both real and digital activity online. We've tried everything- therapists, psychiatrists, hospitals, mental health programs, new schools, police, and of course doing our best to be supportive through it all.\n\nWe had a recent argument about her not doing anything at home- no work, school, or chores, and that she needed to start showing respect and helping with chores. She said she'd rather move out than deal with that, packed 3 bags, and left. I told her the door was open whenever she decided to help with chores and respect us.\n\nShe moved into a motel with a guy (10 years older) and girl she met online 4 days prior. She hadn't asked to come home, only for more clothes and meds. Since then, I found out that-\n\n-she is telling everyone she was kicked out\n\n-she gave a complete stranger online money, her SSN, and photo of her license because that person said they need help opening an account and would pay her back.\n\n-she stole her brother's money a month prior (i found the empty card hidden in her room).\n\nShe finally admitted that the 3 of them were kicked from the motel and the girls hang out while he works, then all 3 ride subways overnight, even though it happened a few days before. I suggested she look for shelters, hang out at the local library during the day, or call the trade school that offered housing and pay that had already accepted her (she refuses to leave her new friends). But I told her that since I found the stolen money and proof of illegal activities, the offer to come back when she did chores and respected us was gone. \n\nI was told it's wrong to let your kid struggle and risk great harm. I feel like it is, but I'm finally experiencing peace for the first time in years. \n\nLike i said, she isn't asking to come home yet.

I'm not sure what other people expect you could possibly do more of than you've already done. You cannot force your adult child to come home and live under your rules if she doesn't want to. You cannot force your adult child to accept your help or suggestions either. The only thing you can do at this point is let go and let her figure out her life which is what it sounds like she wants to do.", "Probably NTA\n\nIt's a very tricky grey area when it comes to your own kids. You want them to be safe and well, you want then to suceed in life--but you can't make them do it if they're determined to fuck up. Some people *only* learn by making mistakes.\n\nShe chose to leave when you asked her to do chores (not even \"get a job\" just *chores*!). You're now choosing not to let her back due to her behavior. You know she'd lie about you, you know she'd steal from you. She hasn't changed significantly enough in a few months to be given another chance yet.", "Personally, I think this is tough love. It sounds like you've extended every olive branch possible, but she's determined to run her life into the ground. At some point, you have to let her sink or swim on her own. We might not always agree with our kids' life choices, but the best way for them to learn is to try and fail. That's how we, as parents, know anything about anything, right? Life experience. And the bottom line is you can't have an adult in your home who is stealing and partaking in nefarious activities. I think you're doing the right thing by being available to talk to, but also rescinding financial help and shelter. Be kind so she knows she can count on you when she is in unsafe or abusive situations--you don't want to push her away in that regard, but keep maintaining your boundaries. Your peace matters too. NTA.", "Maybe is the best judgement I can give here.\n\nWhen people say we tried everything.  Sometimes that's true.  Sometimes it's far from the truth.

You tried your best and that\u2019s all you can really do.", "NTA -   She does not want your help right now.  She can live however she wants to live.   But she is on a slippery slope to addiction if she's not there already and if you are worried about her safety and what you should do if/when she becomes desperate and comes back to you for help, then you may find some substance dependence resources focusing on family/friends of addicts that could help you learn to maintain your boundaries while keeping yourselves safe.   There is a fine line between harm reduction and enabling.  You can still do things like buy her food, or help her pay for treatment or a cheap phone so if she's ever in an emergency she can call you.   But access to your home and other things she can steal and take advantage of would be off limits.   I don't envy you.", "NTA. You tried your best and supported her as well as you could, but she is a legal adult now and has responsibility for her actions. If she is stealing from her brother, she won't respect anyone's property if she is ever welcomed back.", "NTA. You can't help those that don't want it.", "NTA.\n\nShe's not a kid, she's where she is choosing to be and doing what she's choosing to do. At some point we have to accept our adult sons and daughters are responsible for their choices and the outcomes. We can't control them or keep a safety net around them. \n\nYou could make hard boundaries on what is and isn't acceptable over the things you can control, like your home, then stick to those. If she respected those then there likely wouldn't be a problem for you. If she doesn't want to then she won't want to come live with you again-as long as you are following through on putting your foot down.\n\nYou don't say what mental illness she has but if she's a danger to herself or other's you could report that. She's wanting to take her meds so it doesn't sound like she's off the rails with that issue. I'd give her the meds and whatever she owns but I wouldn't enable her current lifestyle.\n\nUltimately this is really beyond what randoms like myself on the internet can give a call on or people that haven't been in your situation.

They bash me on social media and tell everyone that I kicked them out and that I don\u2019t care about them.

It's understandable that you have reached a breaking point and need to prioritize your own well-being and the well-being of your family. It's also important to hold her accountable for her actions, particularly if they involve illegal or dangerous behavior. You have suggested alternative options for her and it's ultimately up to her to decide whether to accept them.", "NTA - Sounds like she\u2019s not in a place where she wants to accept help or actually make a change. There\u2019s only so much a person can do.", "Absent missing information on why she's acting like this, NTA. Much as you wish to help her, not much you can do until she wants to help herself. Until she shows that she's willing to change don't let her return.", "Your daughter has a debilitating illness, has been ill for years, and yet you seem to be expecting her to function in a way that's deemed 'normal'. Some or most of her risky behaviours could be attributable to her illness-- and she might be hanging with risky people because they represent freedom, they accept her as she is without putting conditions on her, and she isn't labelled as 'the mentally ill/difficult one/the screw-up'.\n\nHaving a mental illness is physically exhausting. At my most severe, I couldn't function beyond doing the absolute bare minimum. It felt like I spent every day wading through quicksand, everything took such monumental effort that I did almost nothing. I physically couldn't do any more. So expecting your daughter to work, do chores, schoolwork, or other things that sap the little energy she has, might have been unrealistic on your part. It seems you're expecting her to function at a level that perhaps she simply can't. \n\nThat's not laziness. When she told you she'd rather leave than deal with all the things you expect from her, maybe that was because those things are too much for her to deal with, physically, emotionally and mentally.\n\nMaybe she's decided to leave because the way she sees it, you've been on her case for too long. Your support might have looked very different to her. She might have felt that your treatment of her was harsh, or that you resented her or were punishing her for being ill.\n\nI wouldn't close the door on her entirely. When she's ready to get proper help she probably will, but that may take a long time. You have to remember that this isn't a case of an unruly child deciding to be naughty for the hell of it. Your child has a mental health disability. How would you treat a child who was physically disabled? Would you expect the same level of energy and output from them as you would a nondisabled person? \n\nI'm saying NAH. You're in a difficult situation, and so is your daughter. She doesn't want to be ill, no one does, and if you've been treating her like she's doing things deliberately or wilfully when it might be the illness driving at least some of her behaviours, she's of course going to want to get away from you, especially if you were trying to lay conditions that that she found too hard for her to meet.", "I dont know how this happens but i\u2019ve seen it and its one of my biggest fears in life for one of the kids or niblings ending up so far off the rails.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"-she is telling everyone she was kicked out\" ..

I can't give any solace or advice, but if it means anything - you're a good person. You're doing everything you can do.", "YTA: Mental illness is a disease that is not rational. Abandoning her is an asshole move.", "Your daughter is an adult, not a particularly good one, but still an adult. You don\u2019t have to house her and now need to protect your other kid(s).", "NTA\n\nWhile this may sound harsh, you have to protect yourself and look out for your own mental, physical, and financial wellbeing. You cannot endlessly support your daughter when she shows no respect for your home and no signs of earnestly trying to improve herself. It is a sad, terrible situation, and I hope your daughter eventually finds whatever help she needs. But I do think it is at a point where it is out of your hands, and now on her to seek out that help for herself.", "NTA\n\nI understand that you want the best for your daughter, and you don\u2019t want to see her struggle in life or go through any hardships, but sometimes people have to go through some difficult experiences in their before they grow as a person.  She\u2019s a young adult, so tbh, if she\u2019s going to make these mistakes and learns the hard way, it\u2019s better for her to go through this now than rather have a family and kids of her own to get caught into it. \n\nShe\u2019s gonna hit rock bottom before she wakes up and comes to some realizations. This might be in the form of waking up in a hospital bed, being in jail, or everyone in her life, including her \u201cfriends\u201d leaving. Sometimes people never grow, and just stay at the low because they\u2019re too stubborn to admit they need help. I\u2019ve met way too many who did end up taking that path, it\u2019s difficult to watch them go through it, but you cannot help people who don\u2019t want it. So, hope for the best, expect the worse.", "NTA but it\u2019s not going to stop you feeling guilty. \n\nYou have to protect yourself and your son so she can\u2019t come back while acting how she is. Not a chance. But maybe set up a plan for how she could behave in order to come back so you don\u2019t feel guilty- that way it\u2019s up to her, not you, so you don\u2019t have to feel guilt.\n\nFor example, could you say to her that if she wants to move back, she can tell you and you will pay for x days in a motel for her (paid direct to the motel obviously), during which time she would need to attend x number of therapy sessions, addiction meetings, job interviews, etc while staying clean from drugs, and her various other vices and while taking her medications properly.\n\nI think you\u2019re not the asshole either way but you obviously feel guilt about it which isn\u2019t going to just disappear because internet strangers say so.\n\nAlso, can I suggest therapy for you, your son and any other family members too.", "NTA. I often contrary to many others because I do not feel that just because you are a parent, it does not mean that you need to allow your adult children that lie to you, cheat you, steal from you, are aggressive with you or refuse to comply with the rules of the house, come back and live under your roof. Mental illness is not an excuse for mistreating your parents or their rules and need not be tolerated. There are other places your daughter can go for help until she has apologized and is willing and able to abide by your rules.", "NTA she is making her choices. I know someone who ended  up homeless because their adult child stole their rent money and the parent got evicted. Now no one will accept them because it damaged their credit and ware living in a hotel. It's been a year. She is self destructive and will drag you down with her.", "You know what they say, people truly only want help and change when they actually seek it, there's a lot if individuals who go down this path and nothing changes their minds and unfortunately this individual may be one of them.", "From the comments looks like she\u2019s had multiple inpatient stays and clinicians only have a few sessions before they realize this young woman needs more help than they can give.", "My sister has it. There was no trauma. She was that way from age 2. \n\nShe will tell you she was abused. It turned out that the \u201cabuse\u201d was other people drawing wholly appropriate boundaries.", "What difference does it make now what caused it? OP wrote how many interventions they\u2019ve tried to help and probably tens of thousands of dollars. OP has another child at home who needs to be protected too.", "BPD is often caused by abuse and neglect.  \n  \nEdit: I love being downvoted when I'm right and people could actually read a book about the subject and see that.", "> BPD is a trauma response, that\u2019s literally what triggers it. \n\nNot always, even though it's common.  There are plenty of other factors that could cause it.", "Just because you have something, doesn\u2019t mean you are educated in it. Stop blaming op, the victim, for her daughters issues", "I\u2019m a disability support worker. I work with and support people with a wide range of mental and physical disabilities. I have extensive knowledge about many disabilities from working with various people on a daily professional basis. I\u2019m telling you that your comment was both uneducated and ignorant.", "NTA If she wants to come home, tell her she first has to go to rehab and then transitional housing. The reason I say this is because she will need to be able to follow rules to get back into the world and function.  If she moves right back home, she probably won't be able to do that , especially if she is mentally ill.  Even this doesn't mean she won't come back and still want to act homeless but sleep at hone.", "If you had educated her when young you wouldn\u2019t need to discipline her now.", "NTA she is an adult she is making her choices and they should not negatively impact those who are currently living in the home", "What the actual fuck?? My niece has been diagnosed with BPD as well as bipolar disorder and ADHD. BPD is not caused by trauma.", "I was going to say this as well, has she been tested for developmental delays? If not it sounds like drugs maybe a factor impairing her judgment as well. I feel for you, I have been a guardian for many kids in very similar situations whose parents could not handle it. All I can say is that in some cases the kids actually do straighten out, but they hit bottom before they bounce back again and meanwhile you just have to hope that you can minimize the chances of jail time, unwanted pregnancy or some other life-changing situation. I'm so sorry for you and I hope your daughter eventually comes to her senses, make sure the lines of communication are open with her but as others have said, change your home security because sounds like she's hanging with bad people.", "Often but not always. Stay at home mom from when she was 2 (as soon as we realized the daycare was understaffed), intact family, she lost her grandmother when she was 10.", "genetics are a huge factor as well. my mom's psychiatrist says that despite not experiencing any significant trauma my siblings and i are more likely to develop ADHD and bipolar. (there's also apparently more than one type of bipolar???)", "bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder are not the same. also the different types of bipolar disorder are: Type 1, Type 2, Cyclothymic, Substance-induced bipolar disorder, and other specified bipolar disorder (used to be called Bipolar NOS in DSM-IV)", "If you try everything you can and your non minor kid just won't listen, there's really nothing you can do but offer to help find services until they get their stuff together and show they can behave. NTA you can't risk being in the same home as this girl, she gave her SSN to a stranger, who knows what could happen if she was let back in the house.", "If it\u2019s a mental illness, does tough love apply here? If she needs medication to be calm then I don\u2019t know. My son was an addict. I don\u2019t believe I\u2019m tough love. I researched, gave him guidance love and it was not easy at all. I never swore at him, I never called him bad names. Just my support. And I\u2019m so happy to say he\u2019s 4 years sober and he\u2019s working full time! I pay it forward by donating money to charities and non profits. He said to me, he was lucky to have me as a Mom , because he never could have survived alone. When you said you were finally having peace and quiet, your daughter must require a lot from you. Mental illness has no break. But I\u2019m wondering if you have reached out to all the services that she is entitled to for assistance. I\u2019m really sorry you have to go through so much. Does she have a social worker? The reason she left was because she didn\u2019t want to help out with household chores. Even walking out over that, she doesn\u2019t realize how wicked the world is. So I hope she gets the care she needs. No one should be homeless. NTA", "NTA.\n\nIf homeless people didn't want to be homeless they wouldn't be.

If you haven't tried anything same.\n\nYou TRIED. You have BEEN trying for how long. She had options and she chose a poor one. She is an adult and as heartbreaking as it may be, she needs to face the decisions she makes.\n\nI hope everyone that matters who she has told rolls their eyes and knows you better than to think you simply kicked her out.\n\nAlso, not letting her back is also protecting her brother.", "But you're not right. To quote yourself \"often caused by abuse and neglect\" often is different to always. And you started out by asking what abuse occured. You're not being downvoted for this statement, your being downvoted for jumping straight to asking someone if they abused their own child for literally no reason beyond a statistical correlation.", "Family history of mental illness. But nothing specific happened to her as far as trauma."]}
