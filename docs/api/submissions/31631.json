Would he really ask his girlfriend to chip in?  Doubtful.\n\nSounds like a cheapskate.", "I'd leave your husband's name off. \n\nThis is a gift from her kids to your mom, it's reasonable that it's *just* from her kids. Split it 3 ways and leave your husband's name off. It's different from you and your husband as a unit giving someone a gift, when it doesn't affect anyone but you and him.", "I\u2019d just start buying my own gift and let the brothers haggle it out. Your mom has 3 children and gets 1 gift. And you all haggle over what, $40?  Your all cheap.", "NTA. Since your brothers also put their GF's names but don't pay their shares, you shouldn't do this either.", "Let your brother's split the gift two ways and you get a separate gift from you and your husband.", "Do you receive gifts as individuals or as \u201cone\u201d? Do your parents and siblings give your husband gifts of his own or is it all stuff for the both of you to share / use together? If he gets his own gifts from your family, he absolutely should be pitching in money. If your single brother and other family spends two people\u2019s worth of money on your household, then two gifts worth of money should be coming out of your household. If your family does a gifts for couples together as one then yeah you can give gifts out the same way. But really in the end it\u2019s Christmas and if you can afford to help with the gifts you want your name on you should. Especially if brother can\u2019t afford to pitch in as much. In my opinion anyone who haggles over every last cent when buying gifts for loved ones is an AH. My family does a price limit and then we all \u201csecretly\u201d go way over it, cuz that\u2019s half the fun. The only ones who don\u2019t are those who don\u2019t have the ability financially, and that\u2019s perfectly acceptable too. I\u2019ll never understand this mindset", "As a single person who has had to deal with this from couples, YTA. Just an FYI, but after a few years of having to give gifts from four people that only three people were paying for, we (the two single people) stopped going in with the couple. Eventually you get fed up. Is it worth it?", "This really isn't a question of whether you're an AH or not.\n\nBut if your hubby's name is going on the gift then it stands to reason the gift is from all 4 of you and should be divided up as such. \n\nIf it's just from her kids, then its split by 3 ways. \n\nBut as adults in your 30s, it might be time to do your own gifting unless you want to get your mom something substantial.", "I'm surprised by the N-T-A's.  This is a recurrent issue for single people.  Example: they purchase a gift for each individual in a couple for each of their birthdays, and then when single person's birthday rolls around, they receive one gift from the couple. Will your husband be getting a present from your mother for Christmas? If so he should be paying his portion of her gift if his name is going on it. Or he can buy his own gift for your mother.  \n\nSure, in lots of families this is NBD to put the couple's name on the gift but your brother doesn't like it and feels your husband should pay in.  YTA if you ignore your brothers displeasure with the arrangement where your husband does not pay in for a gift he is claiming participation in.  \n\nAll this said, my family deals with this by being extremely direct and open about who is buying gifts for who.  We eliminate a huge portion of gift-giving in our family by discussing who we actually WANT to buy gifts for, and who actually wants to participate in gift exchange.", "I'm curious how your Xmas gift-giving is handled more generally:  Does a brother buy a separate gift for you and your husband, or one gift for the both of you, or just one gift for you alone?  Do you buy separate gifts for their girl friends?", "Just put your three names on the gift. And you can get a second smaller gift for her as a couple that you put both of your names on.", "YTA - Only the people that put in should be on the gift. You 3 go in and put your name on this one. Have your husband pick up something small in addition for his gift.", "NAH, you're just discussing something, it doesn't sound like anybody has said or done anything rude. \n\nMy input though, if you want your husband's name on the gift and him to get \"credit\" for being part of the group giving the gift, he should contribute. Honestly , it isn't a big deal either way.", "Does your brother need the money? \n\nJust leave your husband\u2019s name off the gift. Or say it\u2019s from Santa. \n\nNTA", "Let me put things in a perspective you can understand.\n\nForget for a moment this is your brothers and husband. Forget this is a gift for mom. Imagine instead this was a spa weekend with your friends.\n\nYou have two friends Anne and Lucy.  When you guys planned the trip to the spa you agreed to split the costs three ways equally.  However out of the blue you find out that Anne is bringing her younger sister Sally and it is still being split equally 3 ways.  Meaning you are paying for Sally\u2019s trip as well since the expenses went up.  \n\nWould that be fair to you?  To have to pay for someone else\u2019s trip that you didn\u2019t have any say in being part of it to begin with?\n\nWell the same logic applies here with your brothers and husband.  There is nothing wrong with wanting you husband to be included in as a gift giver.  What is wrong is expecting your brothers to cover his share of it.  Instead of splitting the money equally 3 ways you should be paying a bit more to reflect your husband\u2019s contribution. \n\nIt isn\u2019t about excluding your husband and you are a family.  It\u2019s about expecting someone else to cover the cost.  \n\nYou said that they aren\u2019t married meaning they cover the cost only for them.  This gift is only from them.  You are and see your husband as a second limb when it comes to giving gifts.  Which is fine when the gift is just from hubby and you.  When it comes to including other families or people then prices have to match number of people rather than number of households.  \n\nIf the gift was say $120 and you guys were going to split the cost $40 bucks each.  That would be fine as a gift from the 3 of you.  However to throw your husband onto the card and then they had to pay $10 extra is a bit unfair.  As much as $60 seems to much to you while they pay half that is fair.  It isn\u2019t $60 from you alone but $30 from you and $30 from your husband.", "I never ask or expect my partner to contribute to my parent's Christmas presents (though my parents always give him his own gift, they don't just put his name on mine), but they are gifts I am buying on my own, not sharing with siblings. \n\nI see how your siblings would be peeved that his name is going on something that he did not contribute to though. They are paying more to get equal credit to something, while your husband, who contributed nothing, is seen as equally generous to them. \n\nSoft YTA", "NTA- I have 5 siblings.  For years now we have split all gift costs by 6 plus married spouses.  The oldest 3 siblings are married and the younger 3 aren't. We did this entirely because the younger siblings couldn't afford to contribute as much.This lowered their cost without pointing out their financial situations. This was something us older siblings discussed and agreed to first since it financially impacted us the most.  We've also had the youngest contribute non-financially in the past by picking up the gift or installing it (we got mom a dishwasher one year) when he was still in school and had no income. \n\nIf dividing by siblings and spouses was the deal out should have been discussed before.  If you haven't historically done that it shouldn't be assumed.  If you're all of similar financial standing there is no real reason to do that.", "Split it 3 ways and don't put your husband's name on it.", "NTA you split 3 ways!", "NTA\n\nObvious solution. Stop going in with your siblings to buy presents for you mother.\n\nBuy something from you and your husband and let your siblings fend for themselves.", "NTA but it's not a huge amount of money. Why not just split it four ways to keep the peace?", "YTA. If the name is on the gift, he has to pay for it. If he doesn\u2019t it\u2019s a gift only from the people that actually contributed to it. You are not one unit when receiving gifts, since I\u2019m going to get each of you get separate gifts from the family. So why do you require to be a unit when paying for other people\u2019s gifts?", "YTA if you want your husbands name on a gift he should pay up. Also I really don't think that he should be even expected to gift anything to your parents. When my siblings split gifts for my parents we don't put our spouses names on it.", "YTA. But just putting that so the vote counts. No one is really an asshole here.  Although is money really tight? $130 is a small amount to be shared by 4 fully grown adults.  \n\nIf your husband receives a gift from your mother then yes he should be contributing. My husband and I often do joint gifts with my sister for my parents and we pay 2/3 and she pays 1/3. If the three of us are getting credit then the three of us contribute.  That\u2019s not really fair to expect a single person to pay the same as two people.", "YTA.\n\nEither leave your husband's name off the gift, or pay for his share.", "NTA, ask your cheap brother if he's OK with your husband taking 1/4 of any inheritance?\n\n\n I have 2 siblings.

It's all combined money to us and we discuss it with spouses but ultimately we split it per sibling.  The ONLY difference is when my parents were creating their will, my brother and I made SURE that our sister gets an equal share of whatever the grandchildren get too because we have kids and she doesn't.  We want it ALL to be equal as possible and no resentment or surprises.", "I don't think there's a right or wrong here, just please make sure that if your brothers get married the same rules apply for their spouses.", "NTA it should be split 3 ways, she is not your husbands mom", "NTA\n\n3 siblings, 3 way split, partners are only nominal.", "NTA.

It's about time spent together more than anything.\n\nBut yeah, before all that we did have this thing were couples would give a tenner and then us single people would give a tenner too, so there was somewhat of an uneven distribution.\n\nOnly when someone really puts on a buffet or something like that do we all still chip in btw.", "I agree with this point.  Married couples can think of themselves as one unit, but they are not one human.  If your husband gets his individual gift then he needs to pitch in his share, it's not a huge amount of money, just split the purchase, it's $32.50 each, that's a great deal when I think of what I spend on my own mother.  \n\nYTA but I say that very lightly.
