I see a lot of people do this shit at my job where they would cut and see if the people in back of them would actually say anything. I was annoyed so i told them straight up we was in line and to move. They clearly did it on purpose so i didnt care if i was being an ass about it.

You're at an age where its more important than ever to assert and defend your rightful place. Because believe me line cutters assess the entire line of people and they choose to cut you, the nice looking young women, because they know society will treat you like you're Karens for making a fuss.
