We solved this by A) taking her out when she woke up and needed to potty B) limiting water intake after a certain time in the evening until she could control her intake and her bladder better and C) taking her out every night before bed. \n\nYour roommates are not doing any of this. It's bad pet husbandry. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. I'd be kicking out the roommates who defied me like that in my own house. Puppy should never have been there to begin with, and you are frankly being too accommodating.", "NTA. Your tenants are being unreasonable. I would include in the warning a reasonable timeframe (i.e. you have to have the dog trained to sleep through the night by April 15 or something like that).  I would also read up on local landlord/tenant laws, because in a lot of places, your verbal agreement for them to live there is as binding as a written lease, and in a lot of areas, an extra dog wouldn't be grounds for eviction. Make sure you learn what your legal options are. Ideally they will get their shit together, train their dog, and everyone lives happily ever after, but if it comes down to kicking them out, doing it in a way that isn't compliant with local laws can end up giving *them* grounds to sue *you*.\n\nFWIW a [licky mat](https://www.amazon.com/lickimat/s?k=lickimat) with nonfat yogurt spread on the top can be really useful in quieting a fussy dog down, and can help get a dog comfortable in crate training.", "It's their dog why don't they keep it in one of their bedrooms at night I would demand that happen they could trade off nights if they have separate rooms and if not they need to re-home the dog it's your home period NTA", "NTA They are. You told them no to another dog and they went ahead and got one anyway. It's your house you should be able to sleep in it.

I would get evicted if I did that & my landlord doesn\u2019t sleep here. Wtf?", "What lease? My dumb ass let my best friend and his wife move in willy nilly to help them out in a rough spot and they kinda are still here a couple years later. Everyone I know still says I should\u2019ve written up a lease but I figured since I\u2019ve known my buddy since 1st grade it wouldn\u2019t be necessary.", "I don\u2019t know of anywhere that forces a landlord who lives in the same house to accept pets.  They\u2019re not even forced to allow service dogs/assistance dogs.", "Even if I\u2019m the sole owner of the residence and my name is the only one on the deed and bills? Asking out of pure interest.", "Sure but they have three, furthermore everywhere I have ever lived makes me submit proof of vaccinations for my pet some places make me get renters insurance in case my pet hurts someone, also people usually have to pay a pet deposit or pet rent.", "I would follow up in writing so they know you are serious so if you do have to take any kind of action you can\n\nAnd listen this is important you own this house, does your homeowners insurance policy know that you have three dogs there? If any of those dogs bite anyone those people can sue YOU.  You could then go ahead and sue your roommates for your losses because of their dog, but if their dog bites me on your property I\u2019m going to sue YOU because YOU have a house I can go after, they don\u2019t have anything I can win in a judgment.\n\nIf they hassle you call your homeowners insurance company and find out how much it cost to add three dogs and if you can even add three dogs and then tell them they have to pay for that. I\u2019m not even kidding you shouldn\u2019t be having dogs in your house if they\u2019re not covered by your homeowners insurance because you will get sued if they bite someone. You will.\n\nBut listen if you\u2019re not going to be strong enough to follow through on any of this don\u2019t call your homeowners insurance company because if they know you have three dogs and you\u2019re not allowed to have three dogs on your policy and they threaten to cancel you you could end up without homeowners insurance if you don\u2019t have the balls to stand up to your roommates. So be careful with that one, but I\u2019m not kidding you can get sued. You can lose your home. \n\nAnd think about it if they bite someone\u2019s face and that person needs facial reconstruction they will take your house to pay for that. And they will win.", "Good luck!", "They took a 3rd dog against your explicit wishes. You are letting them walk all over you and take advantage of you.\n\nThese aren't your friends. You're not just equal housemates.\n\nYOU ARE THEIR LANDLORD. they did so because you let them get away with it.", "Don't forget to look up eviction laws before you do. There's a minimum amount of time you have to give them, and you can get in trouble if you don't. If you have a contract with them, read it again to refresh your memory, but know that the state/federal minimum trumps whatever is on the contract if the contract's days warning is shorter than state/federal", "Yeah, my only thought would have been to pursue that option first before quasi threatening to her rid of the dog.  That\u2019s obviously going to elicit an emotional reaction", "Obviously a dick move on the roommates part, but this isn\u2019t like some random tenant this is their best friend since 1st grade.  Reddit gets a big hard-on for being right and I feel like it\u2019s always way more complicated than that.  IMO roommates are clearly in the wrong, but \u201cshut the dog up or it\u2019s gone\u201d is also an AH ultimatum to give your friend without trying other options", "There\u2019s nothing stopping you from writing a formal lease today, if you want.  Clear the air, establish some shared expectations, etc.", "NTA then - but there\u2019s your first problem, you need to either tell them to get a handle on this puppy or find a new place to live", "This is a perfect opportunity, you can do one now. You can sit down with them and tell them that you\u2019re very upset that you told them not to get another dog and you did anyway so you would like to get a rental agreement in writing if they want to continue to live there. This is a great way to get that done right now they already disrespected verbal request so something in writing is reasonable", "I\u2019m a law school grad and a former service dog grad, and I\u2019ve never heard of anywhere that would force you to accept a pet in your own home.  You wouldn\u2019t have to allow a working service dog/assistance dog if you didn\u2019t want to, much less a pet.  Even in a more common commercial landlord setup, at least in the US, the right to deny pets is pretty close to absolute, as long as it\u2019s not done in a discriminatory fashion (eg, allowing whites families to have pets but not black families, or men but not women).  The only exempted pets are emotional support animals (ESAs), and for those the tenant has to provide documentation from their mental healthcare provider stating that they are being treated for a mental illness and the ESA has been prescribed by the mental health professional (my husband has had an ESA since 2012, so I\u2019ve some experience with that law, too).", "Why isn\u2019t OP entitled to an emotional reaction when they own the house and they told them to dogs is plenty and they went and got another dog anyway that now they don\u2019t take care of? So the person who disrespected their landlord is entitled to an emotional reaction but OP isn\u2019t? Why not?", "Yeah maybe it\u2019s time for that formal lease.", "That\u2019s exactly where it\u2019s getting to. I\u2019m gonna have that talk today with them. Dreading that situation already but it is what it is.", "Thank you for that information. I figured that\u2019s how it was honestly. I hate the situation because I love animals, especially dogs, but I also gotta get sleep so I can pay my bills and just have a overall good quality of life.", "I live in New Hampshire and last year they were talking about passing a law that says that landlords can\u2019t discriminate against pets, but that wouldn\u2019t be a free-for-all where you can have three dogs in a one bedroom apartment or something like that. I assume it would be reasonable, and this is not a reasonable situation.", "No I meant that OP providing that extreme outcome would cause the roommates to be emotional.  OP is obviously well within his rights to do whatever he wants to in his own house, but I was just saying start with the most reasonable approach and then escalate when necessary", "NTA, your house, your rules", "There's a fourth option: they move out with the dog. You are NTA. This is outrageous behaviour. \n\nIs there not anything in the lodger agreement they signed with you that says they cannot bring in new pets to the house without the owner's permission?", "Please update when you guys talk! I hope this end well for you and the puppy", "You're being an AH to yourself if you don't just evict the roommates.\n\n> decided to get another puppy after I said that i wasn\u2019t okay with having another dog in the house \n\nThey have zero respect for you. You haven't put your foot down. You should have said no as soon as they walked the dog through the door. Quit being a pushover, get a spine and kick them out. Be a landlord first, friend second.", "You are NTA. It's your house. You did not want another dog. Definitely stand by your decision.", "NTA.  You specifically told tenants living in your home that you did not agree with them getting another pet.  The three choices sound fair to me.", "NTA", "NTA - Begin the eviction process now.  You did not agree to the new dog.", "Congratulations you've entered into a month to month lease (subject to local laws)! Either party can end the lease with 30 days written notice!", "NTA.
