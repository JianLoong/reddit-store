{"id": 21010, "submission_id": "14n6bh8", "title": "AITA for not ordering food and drinks with my out-of-town friend visiting my city?", "selftext": "My friend, call him John, planned to visit my city for 4 days last week and asked if he could stay with me for 3 nights to save on hotel costs. I was more than happy to host him and catch up, as it had been over a year since I'd seen him. We share some mutual friends who live here, so they'd graciously organized dinners and nights for bar hopping/drinking/clubbing etc. \n\nSocially, I was happy to show up to things they organized as much as I could. However, I'm in a tricky financial situation where, despite good income, I am doing some pretty strict belt tightening for reasons. And a big part of my \"austerity\" measures are no meals and drinks outside, at least for the rest of the year, as I live in a very expensive city. So, John had planned 5 meals with me and our other friends along with a drinking/clubbing night, and I chose to simply eat beforehand and just order water wherever we went.\n\nThe first dinner, he and others had a more concerned reaction to my choice, but as we kept going out, they seemed to find it genuinely upsetting. John explained that I was \"being a buzzkill\" because I wasn't sharing these experiences with them, and it felt like \"I didn't want to be there\". But I felt the complete opposite; doesn't it say more about how I value our friendship if I'm willing to sit with them at restaurants and such without getting food? Eventually, for our final lunch, I relaxed my own rules and got an appetizer because I genuinely felt bad, but he still seemed to be annoyed overall.\n\nThere was some bad weather that canceled a lot of flights, so the airline rescheduled him to fly 2 days after his original date. I offered him to stay however much longer he needed, which he took up, but he then he stopped inviting me to some more things he planned for his extra time with our mutuals. When he left, I apologized to him if my behavior affected the vibes, and he said \"yeah that was all pretty fucking weird, but you do you I guess\", and I could feel the tension between us. The reason I mention that he stayed at my apartment is because, in my head, if he really wanted me to eat with them, why not just cover my tab for a meal or two in exchange for a place to stay? Obviously I wouldn't dare say that, as that's just improper etiquette and I didn't expect anything in return for providing a place to crash, but it doesn't sound crazy to me as a small courtesy/token of appreciation.\n\nMaybe I really should have relaxed my rules, as I do value our friendship. But meals and drinks out add up quickly, and I'm not in vacation mode.", "created_utc": 1688145373, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14n6bh8/aita_for_not_ordering_food_and_drinks_with_my/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He might be feeling uncomfortable about his own spending habits or something similar.", "Definitely NTA--John is an asshole for caring more about appearances than valuing your company and friendship. You're correct: John could have (and should have) offered to pay your way during at least one of those unexpected two days, and the fact that he didn't shows that he's a classless weasel.

Instead he didn't even do that and threw a hissy fit. I'm on a very specific diet right now, so I pretty much cook all of my meals and don't have any alcohol. My friends don't give a shit if I don't order food at restaurants, or drink mocktails instead when we go to bars. \n\nIf I were you he's never getting a free stay with me ever again.", "The irony of being annoyed at you for saving money, while staying at your house *in order to save money*\n\nYour friend is a bonehead, and you are NTA", "NTA.  When I stay with my friends I offer dinner, groceries, other things as a thank you.  Not sure why your friend couldn't pay for a meal as a thank you.  And then to give you attitude while in your home?  Yup, his bags would have been packed and he could stay with the friends he was hanging out with.", "What you did is TOTALLY acceptable - what I question is why your \"friends\" would treat you so poorly and get an attitude about such nonsense.  Just because you're saving money doesn't mean your fucking weird.  You are absolutely right too - you pal John saved a few hundred dollars by staying with you, he could at least paid for your meal EVERY night he stayed and still come out ahead.  Are you sure these people are your friends?  NTA", "ESH\n\nYou should have explained your financial situation/planning before John stayed with you. It wouldn\u2019t have hurt to enjoy a couple nights with your friend either. \n\nJohn stayed with you, in part to save money, but he criticized you for attempting to save money by not going out every night while he was there. That\u2019s annoying. He also should have treated you to at least one night out considering you saved him money by allowing him to stay with you.", "I get that you're belt tightening, OP. But IMHO going to a restaurant and not ordering ANYTHING (even an appetizer, which can be more than enough for a meal) is just an AH thing to do. If you can't afford to eat out, then suggest something else that's free. It's possible that your friends and/or John would have offered to pay for an appetizer for you when eating out.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t understand why he\u2019d be annoyed if you didn\u2019t order anything in the first place. I\u2019m not an expert on social expectations, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s mandatory to order something if you\u2019re going out with friends. Especially if it\u2019s in a group setting.

As a host, it's your job to make your guest feel comfortable.  Instead, you took your pennypinching to the extreme and made your guest uncomfortable.

If I\u2019m crashing somewhere, I pay for the meals. My friends return the favor when they visit me.", "NTA. Dude got five free nights in an expensive city due to your hospitality; the right thing to do would be to treat you to a meal or three, considering he invited himself!", "NTA\n\nIts ok for John to save money and ask for favors on top, but you can\u2019t save money and manage yourself?\n\nFrame it to him that way and see what he says?", "Yeah I mean, of course, I explained all of that to him and the others, that I needed to meet some savings goals and wasn't prepared to spend on dining out but nonetheless was excited to spend time together after it's been so long. But I guess since we're all in our late 20s with good, stable careers, doing something like this is very... uncommon, to say the least.", "Yeah I wasn't expecting much, just like one drink would've been a nice gesture. We do go way back, so I like to think of him as a good friend, but man this got me feeling pretty bad since I really wasn't sure if I was in the wrong.", "Yeah :/ to be fair to him, I don't think he was necessarily annoyed that I was saving money and more annoyed that I wasn't like engaging in experiences with him by just drinking water everywhere. And sure I wish I could've, but the financial side of it just wasn't going to work for me.", "Understood. I admittedly did not explain this before he arrived, and didn't explain it even until we had sat down for our first meal, so there was a communication flaw on my part. And yeah maybe I should've bit the bullet and not been such a cheapskate for a few days. I can definitely see why it'd be awkward or uncomfortable for someone to not be eating anything while everyone else is feasting away.", "I see, fair enough. It just sucks cause they're all foodies and most of their activities revolved around food and drinks. We had a picnic with snacks and wine in a park but that was about it for non-food-place activities. But you're right, I could've taken some initiative there. \n\n> It's possible that your friends and/or John would have offered to pay for an appetizer for you when eating out.\n\nIt would've been awesome if they did, but they didn't offer to... and I just thought it'd be weird or honestly kind of rude to ask someone to cover your bill without them offering to start with, you know.", "I think it's just the notion that eating together with someone is breaking bread with them, you know. We're good pals who go way back, so I guess it seemed strange to him that I wasn't willing to eat with him and our other friends. I probably seemed awkward and distanced by not sharing a meal. And of course, it's not that I was unwilling, I just wasn't willing to pay for my own meal outside. I believe they took offense to that, thinking \"we're all such good friends yet you're not willing to spare a little cash to eat with us\". I just thought it was fine because I'm still present with them, I don't need to be eating. And I just don't feel like compromising on my financial goals to get $30 plates of mediocre chicken lol.", "This is BS. \n\nOP, ignore this. NTA. You do not have to put yourself into a financial hole to make a guest feel comfortable. What if OP was a recovering alcoholic? Should he \"just relax\" and have a drink?\n\nAs a GUEST, his friend should have treated him to a few drinks/dinners. Like a normal, good guest.", "What bull shit is this.", "Fair enough, I'm definitely feeling some regret about being the Mr. Scrooge lol.", "Yep, I get it. Eating with others is breaking bread, so I guess even though I was actively engaged in conversation, not eating I guess places some distance between people. I just really didn't want to shell out that much money, especially since most meals out in my city are going to net you around $30 altogether at decent establishments.", "\ud83d\ude44 you were definitely NTA, your friend's reaction was absolutely a Him problem, not a You problem.", "Given that you did explain it, and he was imposing upon your hospitality, he is a HUGE AH for not treating you to *at least* one very nice dinner, and frankly more.", "If someone made the effort to come and spend time with me, despite being super-broke, I'd be so happy. Hell, the money he saved could have at least bought you a drink or two(as you said) if he wanted you to \"engage\" a bit more\n\nChalk it up to a bad experience, but you did nothing wrong", "With the amount of money you saved him on a hotel he could have afforded to buy you a meal or two (or more) and not only have been able to 'share the experience' with you but returned the favor. Sheesh. He doesn't sound like a great friend or maybe just not a very smart one, IDK.  You're definitely NTA.", "Which makes sense"]}
