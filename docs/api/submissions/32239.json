I don't use them, ever.  If I'm with people who insist on playing the pokies I don't touch them and just wander around taking in the scene.  It's just awful.  They say they love it but nobody is smiling.  People shit and piss on the seats because they think they're just a few spins away from a jackpot that never comes.
