I would recommend setting up a monthly budget where both of you have \u201cfun money\u201d and he can gamble all he wants with his fun money and any winnings but he\u2019s cut off when that money runs out. And along with a money budget, implement a time budget as well-you each have a certain amount of time away from the kids each month. If he wants to spend his time away gambling, great, but then he has to watch the kids while you go out and do what you want with your fun money. \n\nAgain, it sounds like he\u2019s got a gambling addiction so I don\u2019t think these budgets will work without bringing up bigger issues/fights but I think he needs a wake up call and you deserve to have fun without being worried that he\u2019s going to ditch you and dump $$ into the slot machines as a result.", "NTA because that's ridiculous if that's the rule he's imposing he should get exactly as much as the dessert cost to spend.", "That's a gambling addict making excuses. NTA", "NTA\n\nGambling can quickly get out of control. \n\nKeep a close eye on the statements (turn off the cash advance option on credit cards) and start an emergency fund he doesn\u2019t have access to. \n\nMy ex\u2019s pokie addiction hit 6 figures. He was incredibly sneaky and manipulative by the end, and basically became a different person.\n\nFYI for non-Australians. Gambling is a massive problem in Australia. Pokies (slot machines) in the majority of pubs, in full view of the restaurant and kids play areas.  Betting odds provided during the broadcast of many sporting events and non-stop advertising. \n\nThe government gets taxes from gambling so don\u2019t do much to deter it.", "He's throwing red flags all over here. Dessert isn't equivalent to $50 unless that tavern is some sort of dessert wonderland. He's finding reasons to gamble more and more. \n\nI work in social services, I see what gambling does, I watch it ruin families ALL THE TIME. You'll see news stories of people stealing from their schools (from Parenr Advisory Councils, School Board Members caught stealing school funds, etc) and people stealing from their employers and it's almost always to pay gambling debts. \n\nGambling sucks you in with the promise of the next round solving all of your problems. It's insidious. You and your husband need to have a serious talk about this. \nNTA", "Do you each have your own official amount of spending money per week/month? He can spend that amount on gambling and no more, when he is out on his own or with his friends. This takes the gambling out of family night (you should also get the same number of nights out without kids, so once a week or every other week, whatever you decide). If it becomes a problem beyond that, he needs addiction help. \n\nNTA.", "Gambling can become a disease, just like alcoholism.  He better be careful and you need to keep an eye on his spending.", "If you haven\u2019t got equal access to ALL statements/bills/accounts/etc. then get on that now.

I'd have a non-negotiable need to be doing the family finances with him twice a week and keeping separate, EQUAL discretionary spending accounts.\n\nAlso, check your credit reports.  How many credit cards does he have that she doesn't know about?", "They used to have a lever instead of buttons so plenty of people I've met in the US call them \"one-armed bandits\"", "Also, the fact that he considers a pub dessert equal to $50 of gambling is red flag. In no world do those things compare.

Even the extremely fancy ones at the good bakery are only about $15 (US--not sure what the conversion rate is, but I'm guessing it's not 3x more expensive). The husband's spending on gambling fun seems a bit problematic, and it seems like a good idea to talk about a \"fun budget\" and then check back in a couple months and see if he's stuck to that.", "Sounds like she's already got a husband with a problem.", "And isn't he supposed to be at dinner with his family during this time?  Yes, yes he is.  He ignores them to gamble.  Taking food off table.\n\nIf only there was a song about this.

And you do it from your phone so there is no escaping it once you are in", "I would not equate gambling with heroin.  But if he's spending hundreds a month on it, the financial cost is similar.  If he's got to gamble during family outings, the social cost and the bad example to the kids are concerning.  If he's bargaining to do more gambling...\n\nOkay.  Changed my mind.  The gambling is bad.  Even if he can currently afford it, it's still an addiction, messing with his thinking and relationships.\n\nThey need to discuss this.  I bet he's already lying about finances. \ud83d\ude2c\n\nOP, NTA.  Hon, get some pints of gourmet ice cream.  You'll need them when you force the true state of your family's finances into the light.  Do that now, before you're homeless with children in tow.", "He's already developed a full blown gambling problem.", "With children!", "Yeah, agreed. I really don't like that he's got this \"rule\" about how he can gamble if she has dessert. \n\nIt feels like it carries the existential weight of being like two people who both have addiction problems being each other's accountability partners - but a) there's no indication that OP has a dessert addiction, and b) there doesn't seem to be any reciprocal deal for OP to get something nice when he goes out to gamble on other occasions. It's just...controlling her by making her responsible for his actions. And then if she complains about his gambling/tried to talk about his problem, well it's all her fault and she should just choose not to eat dessert...", ">he has had this 'condition' that he says to me, which is, if I want dessert at the pub after dinner, he gets to go on the pokies\n\n>there are plenty of 'rules' that he makes for us and me that I try my best to stick to because they're reasonable (eg. Me getting our oldest to daycare before 7.30am, no computer games for either of us unless both kids are asleep)\n\nEquating a dessert to $50 in gambling isn't the only red flag. How many \"conditions\" and rules is he imposing on OP? So she can *never* have a dessert ever or he's going to go to the slots. This isn't an agreement she devised. He imposed this as a means to control her and get what he wants. \n\nVery, VERY, concerning.", "This stood out to me right away.

It was a beautiful and heartbreaking story about her brother Phillip, who hid his gambling addiction and sadly took his own life.
