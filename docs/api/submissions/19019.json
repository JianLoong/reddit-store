They receive the message and try to communicate in a more adult way in future. \n\n2. They receive the message but they don't have the emotional maturity to communicate that way so they bottle up their feelings. \n\n3. They're not capable or willing to do better so they just keep acting out.\n\nAll you can do is communicate your expectations and then stick to them. You shouldn't have to put up with someone deliberately dragging you down.", "Next time she says \u201cI don\u2019t think you do\u201d ask her if she ever heard of a self-fulfilling prophesy.\n\nNTA. She sounds manipulative and exhausting", "NTA, Sounds like trust issues", "NTA - I agree that she really needs to elaborate on why she feels that way, where you two can sit down and have a conversation about it. Otherwise, what's the point of her constantly saying it if she isn't prepared to sit down with you & have a discussion about it.

NTA", "NTA.  Wow, that\u2019s a terrible thing to say to one\u2019s partner.  Routinely diminishing or casting doubt on your partner\u2019s feelings for you is deeply wounding.  It would be one thing if she was saying, \u201cWhen you do X, it makes me feel like you don\u2019t care about me.\u201d  That\u2019s communication - it tells you that X hurts her, that she feels like her feelings on the issue are being ignored, and that she feels like she\u2019s not a priority to you.  It gives you something you can work on and change to make things better for you both.  But just casting aspersions on your feelings and refusing to tell you why\u2026that feels like it\u2019s intended to hurt/make you feel insecure, or intended to make you start throwing out every affectionate behavior you can in the hopes of proving your love.  It\u2019s a really unhealthy thing to do to your partner, not to mention really unfair.", "NTA\n\n>She said I was being unreasonable for snapping at her when she hasn't done anything wrong.\n\nBut she is doing something wrong. she's refusing to communicate in your relationship.

Even if she isn't intentionally trying to manipulate you she's just being maddeningly unhelpful. How are you supposed to fix whatever is broken if she isn't communicating with you?

It\u2019s your choice how to respond\u2026 and it\u2019s okay to step back and ask if the relationship has run its course.

There could be thousands of reasons but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong for getting upset about it but it may just be something out of your control that she\u2019s feeling.

Does she think you are lying when you say you love her or does she believe she knows your own feelings well enough? Is this a passive-aggresive way of asking you to be more affectionate? It is bad communication at best, insulting you at worst.", "NTA. This is manipulative behavior and bordering on abuse. I don\u2019t know what her goal is, but this kind of DARVO shit never ends well.

I sometimes have similar fears, and am definitely terrible at understanding my own feelings, so having a conversation about it makes me really nervous. I will go with NAH. Try not to jump to conclusions like many comments here. She might actually be having difficulty processing what she is going through.

The kind of people who say women are too emotional typically do things like not counting male anger as an emotion, only female anger.  Men display a whole hell of a lot more anger than women do.  Every gender has, on average, about the same amount of emotions."]}
