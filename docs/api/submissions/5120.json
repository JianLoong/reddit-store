He would follow girls and ask to take pictures with them, specifically when they were in swimsuits/sports bras. As much as anyone tried to suggest to him \"politely\" that harassing the women in our organization the way he was was not okay, he still did it. He stopped doing it to me once I said exactly what was wrong (no harsh emotion, but also no pleasantries; I was as stark as possible) and I noticed he wouldn't do it around me, but heard from other women that he would still do it to them. Talking to administration or TAs didn't help, even if they did have an aside conversation with him. I still don't know whether he was intentionally being obtuse to a literal description of why his behavior was wrong, but as soon as he was held accountable for it directly (from the women he was approaching), he would stop.\n\nTL;DR: Even in the case that he \\*didn't\\* know it wasn't okay to harass you, you still did the right thing. Nobody can misunderstand \"Do not touch me\" unless they choose not to.\n\nEDIT: added for clarity that when he was held accountable by the women he was harassing, \\*then\\* he would stop.", "My son had Asperger\u2019s syndrome.  (Think Steve Jobs). He had difficulty with social cues, but eventually time and some pretty helpful friends helped him navigate what is good and what is bad in relation to interactions.  One thing we discussed was that no one should ever invade the space of another person, either being done to him, or him doing it to another person.  He got it, and the one thing I always told him was to think how HE would feel if something was done or said to him before he said or did anything.

Autistic people aren't better at learning rules and sticking to them than neurotypical people, and to generalize and say that autistic people are good at following the rules is othering us. I think a more clear/true statement would have been \"Being autistic doesn't affect his ability to learn the rules and stick to them.\" I know you're autistic as well; just wanted to give my own input on this :)", "Another autistic person here.
