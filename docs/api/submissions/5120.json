Being autistic doesn't mean that you can get away with everything.

I don't even get these people's point. Sure, some people with autism miss SUBTLE, unspoken social cues. Nothing about autism means you don't understand what someone is saying directly and clearly to you. Tell EVERYONE if this kid puts his hands on someone else again.", "Firstly NTA secondly how old are y\u2019all? He sounds like a first grader who\u2019s parents would say he\u2019s acting out because he likes you. As an autistic person myself that\u2019s not an excuse to act like this. No matter how autistic you are because it is a spectrum no means no, and no is a complete sentence. I would tell an authority that this is going on because this is not OK.", "NTA. \"Stop touching me without my consent.\" is the most perfect thing you could have said.", "NTA. I know several people on the spectrum and all of them understand that not touching people. \n\nIt's hard for people with autism to know what is appropriate from non-verbal cues, as far as I know it's not hard for them to follow simple instructions like \"don't touch me\".\n\nHe is definitely the asshole for hiding behind his condition.\n\nHe is making it harder for everyone with autism to get respect and understanding by being this way.\n\nHe probably just does whatever he wants and has never been called out because people are so afraid to offend.", "NTA. I'm autistic myself and we're NOT STUPID. We can very well understand when people tell us off in a clear and direct manner. You literally said he couldn't touch you without consent. And that's that. What he's doing now is being pretty disgusting. He's not dumb. He disrespectful. Stand your ground in this. I bet he wouldn't want other dudes touching him despite him saying no.", "NTA. Autism isn\u2019t a free pass to be a jerk. You were right to call him out for touching you and it\u2019s gross that he got all his friends to come over and try to convince you that *you* were the disrespectful one. \n\nYou should talk to your friends about how you collectively react when this guy harasses you. It\u2019s not right that he touches all the girls and you all usually try to be quiet about it. It\u2019s time for you girls to unionize and stop politely enduring harassment. It\u2019s never okay for someone to touch your hair or clothes and being polite about it only gives guys like this permission to keep doing it. Autism or no, any time any boy in your class acts creepy toward a girl, it\u2019s unacceptable and they need to be loudly told so.", "NTA\n\nYou gave him an accommodation by repeatedly politely declining his request for a date. If you didn\u2019t know he had autism you would have already reported his harassment to your school and the authorities.\n\nHe escalated to touching you in a frightening way. Not okay and you need to talk to your school so they can offer the help he is clearly not getting.", "NTA. He should absolutely be able to abide by your explicit requests to be left alone, not touched and not bothered. Autism may be a reason for his behavior but it\u2019s not an excuse and never should be.", "Absolutely NTA being autistic is not an excuse to do what he wants and not listen when being told no! You were not rude or disrespectful to him, but he was to you!", "NTA\n\nAutism or  not he's still not allowed to touch you or harass you.  \n\nHe seems to be pushing your boundaries and he wants to use autism as his excuse to do so.", "NTA there is no excuse for being inappropriate like this. Even a dog understands the word no.", "NTA\n\nNo I\u2019m sorry he doesn\u2019t get to use his autism as an excuse to touch people. He can learn that it\u2019s inappropriate to do so. You said not to do something and that is OK, OP. \n\nHe is in the wrong not you.", "NTA. Clearly telling someone no isn't a social cue.", "NTA You absolutely should continue to say no and report to an authority (teacher, school counselor, administrator) if he continues to ignore your demands to not be touched.\n\nThe people enabling this kid's behavior are not doing him any favors.  He's going to get into trouble he doesn't want if he doesn't learn to keep his hands to himself. This is typical \"I like you\" behavior from immature kids.

Keeping your hands to yourself is something you learn in kindergarten. His condition doesn\u2019t explain or excuse his behavior.\n\nAs for his toadies there\u2026 yeah, they\u2019d be giving you a hard time for saying no even if he wasn\u2019t autistic.\n\nIf you\u2019re in high school let your principal know what\u2019s going on.", "NTA.  Missing social cues is one thing, but you straight you told him to stop.  He is being a creep and it's separate from the autism", "NTA. He was, in fact, touching you without your consent.

You calling him on it doesn\u2019t make you the asshole. Him being autistic isn\u2019t an excuse to be an asshole.", "Nta. Im assuming you are a minor.
