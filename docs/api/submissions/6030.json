At first, it was great. He\u2019s adorable and smart and a little feisty. My kids loved him. \n\nHe eventually became close with only Sarah and my husband, likes me but not nearly as much as Sarah or my husband, tolerates my youngest, and hates my oldest. Sarah blames it on my oldest being mean to him at first but she was just playing rough. She\u2019s rough with everything though so it\u2019s not like she was trying to be mean to him. \n\nHe started to show aggression towards my oldest and youngest. If my oldest goes too close to him he\u2019ll growl at her. My youngest yells at him for growling at the oldest and he growls at the youngest in response. He\u2019s never bitten any of them but he has snapped a couple times. \n\nYesterday he kept growling at me, my oldest, and my youngest until Sarah picked him up and took him to her room. We weren\u2019t doing anything to him except trying to pet him. I decided we need to rehome this dog and try again later. I found a good shelter but Sarah is refusing to let him go. She wants to try training classes and says getting him neutered will help but all of that is expensive and time consuming. Most training classes want an adult to go and I\u2019m busy between work and 3 kids. They\u2019re also expensive and it\u2019s not like Sarah can afford these classes. Same with neutering. We\u2019ve called around and the vets around us charge at least $400, then there\u2019s the recovery and we can\u2019t stay home with him after. I think rehoming him is the best thing for the family but Sarah is a wreck and cries every time it\u2019s brought up. She\u2019s threatening to hide the dog from us so we can\u2019t rehome him, which I think is stupid and childish. \n\nMy husband was okay with rehoming him but now is on her side so I just wanted to know if I was the asshole.", "created_utc": 1672429807, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zz9nzf/aita_for_wanting_to_rehome_my_daughters/", "score": 233, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The dog is literally telling the children not to pet it and they keep doing it. Your kids need to respect that dog\u2019s boundaries and leave it alone. The dog needs to be neutered. Animal owners like you who defend your children\u2019s shitty treatment of the animal (playing too rough with it) and this conditioning it to be aggressive then blaming it and wanting to get rid of it piss me off.", "YTA- neutering is something that should have been done when you got him. If you didn\u2019t plan to neuter or train him, then you didn\u2019t have any business adopting him in the first place. Pets cost money and take time to train. You have been his family for 2.5 years. Figure it out.", "YTA \n\n1. You shouldn\u2019t have a dog for 2.5 years without neutering him- that\u2019s irresponsible.\n\n2.

(Also, its shitty of you to excuse the child\u2019s behavior because \u201cshe\u2019s rough with everything\u201d and just expect the dog to be ok with that)\n\n3. Animals, like people, usually don\u2019t like being yelled at. Maybe you should teach your children how to behave.\n\n4. Pets are expensive and you should have taken that into consideration 2.5 years ago instead of using it as an excuse now. Instead of jumping straight to giving up the dog, maybe suggest you daughter get a part-time job or use her allowance etc to help with some of the expenses of training. (All the training in the world isn\u2019t going to totally fix the problem if the other kids keep being AH to the dog though)", "YTA - first of all why wasn\u2019t he neutered as a puppy? That\u2019s a whole thing in its own right. Second, playing \u201crough\u201d is a good way to condition the dog that you don\u2019t respect it\u2019s boundaries. It is using the growling to tell you that he doesn\u2019t want you to get too close. And you ignore him. Go do some self training first.", "YTA. You let your child get a dog, knowing you wouldn't want to handle the expenses that come with having one? Also, I don't know where you live, but a neuter doesn't cost $400. (Not even spaying does, and that's a much more invasive procedure.) Not to mention, neutering an animal is a BASIC PART OF ITS CARE. Any half decent pet owner knows this.\n\nAlso, letting your children torment a dog will result in an aggressive dog, period. Do better.", "I grew up with dogs and I've never seen or had a dog that became suddenly aggressive out of the blue. If the dog didn't show aggression for the first two and a half years, there has got to be some kind of precipitating event that has caused the dog to become aggressive toward those particular family members.\n\nThe dog doesn't know that your oldest is \"rough with everything\", it only knows that it was treated poorly by the oldest and no longer trusts her. Besides being \"rough with everything\" isn't a good excuse for treating an animal poorly.\n\nAlso, you've had the dog for two and a half years and haven't gotten it neutered? WTAF! There are plenty of low or reduced cost spay and neuter programs damn near everywhere. You didn't stop to think that keeping an intact male dog *might* increase the likelihood of aggression later?

YTA, and it's not even a close contest.", "YTA \n\nYou should have not gotten a pet if you are not going to take care of it. That includes neutering, vet costs, and training. Dumping a handful of low quality kibble into a bowl is not just what is required of owning a dog. Your family made this dog aggressive. It is your fault. I feel sorry for the dog.

YOU, the adult, got your 14 year old a dog. if YOU could not afford vet bills or training, then that is YOUR problem and YOU should not have gotten a dog. and if you cannot teach your children how to be gentle with animals, that is ALSO your problem. rehoming a dog that YOU allowed to be aggressive and that YOU got specifically for your child is so so messed up. if it ends up being the only option, so be it, but you better be apologetic to your daughter and make it clear it's not her fault", "YTA to jump straight to rehoming. There are places that offer discounted neutering. Do some research. Nobody has to stay with a dog after neutering. I think you would be very surprised how much neutering will help. She loves the dog and he loves her. Make rehoming him a last choice after neutering him. IMO.", "YTA.\nWho gets a dog for a 13 year old without a plan for training? Or money for vet bills? \nYou're aware your youngest was rough with the dog, and probably still is, and do nothing other than excuse it by saying she's rough with everything? The dog won't know that, nor is it a valid excuse. \nIf the dog is growling when you're trying to pet it, stop trying to pet it. If ypu, youngest and oldest want something soft and fluffy to stroke, gey a stuffed.\nIf the dog growls at the other two kids, it probably has good reason, since it's fine with Sarah and your husband. \nLeave the dog be, let Sarah and your husband take care of it, and tell the other two kids to leave it alone if it doesn't like them. It mat come round to them in time.", "Hi! Veterinary technician that works on behavior medicine. \n\n1.  Never ever punish or scold a dog for growling.  In fact, when a dog growls, you should thank them for the warning. Growling is a last esort communication from a dog to back off or it will nite because you have ignored all its body language and communications that it does not like what you are doing and to back off.  Punishing or scolding a dog for growling is like taking the batteries out of your fire alarm. You are twcaung the dog to not give a warning g and to go straight to biting. \n\n2. The dog was giving you VERY clear communication that ot did not want to be petted and you guys were ignoring it and trying to force it to accept the petting. When the dog tells you to leave it alone. Leave it the fuck alone.  Consent matters with animals too and ignoring a dog and trying to do what you want to it when he is telling you to back off us how you get bit. \n\n3. Your oldest child is an asshole. And you're a bigger asshole for allowing your oldest to msuyreasy the dog. Clearly, the dig didn't like her \"rough play\". Your job is to teach your children to respect living things and treat them well. Some dogs LOVE rough play. Yours does not and allowing her to mistreat it because that's just the way she is a huge failure on your part. She is going to try to do this to another dog that isn't not as tolerant as yours and get mauled, and that poor dog will get euthanized because your oldest is an asshole. \n\n4. Do not rehome the dog. Teach your asshole kids to respect and leave the dog alone and to mot be assholes.\n\n5. There are low cost spay/neuter clinics on every city that will charge less than $100 to neuter him. FYI, this may or may not help depending on how old he is. It also will not help as long as your other kids keep being assholes to hom. Same goes for training. \n\n6. YTA for getting a dog when you can't aggies basic care like neutering and training. When/if you do seek out training DO NOT hire a trainer that uses pinch/shock or any other punishment based training. This will not fix the problem, only mask it. You need a positive reinforcement bases trainer that will get to the root cause of your dog's aggression (fear and anxiety) and address those issues through counter conditioning and positive experiences. Punishment based training has been proven to increase aggression. Also, have your daughter look up KIKOPUP on YouTube. Amazing trainers who have lots of instructive videos on training dogs.  \n\n7. No one needs to stay home with the dog fir revivery after neutering. He will be just fine to be left alone. Just keep the Elizabethan collar on hom so he can't lock his incision.", "YTA. \"All of that is expensive and time consuming\". Yeah, well. You bought a dog and a dog is a commitment. They are expensive and time consuming. He isn't aggressive towards certain people, so I would seriously evaluate how you and your oldest / youngest treat the dog. I would also take him to the vet to see if there is any underlying health conditions that could be causing the aggression or invest the $400 to get him neutered (which should have been done a long time ago anyways). Or, maybe invest in some aggression behavioral training courses. There are so many options, and it's clear your daughter loves the dog.. why give up so easily after 2.5 years?", "YTA\nSo your oldest and your youngest are abusing the dog (a dog does not care about her \"playing rough\", aka being a bully with everybody, they don't fall for your Bullshit rationalizing), you are trying to touch the dog when it clearly doesn't want to be touched by you, but you think the dog is aggressive?\nLeave the dog and your middle child alone and c start parenting your oldest and your youngest", "YTA. And your older daughter too. \n\nHow rough did she play with the dog?", "YTA. Dogs aren\u2019t just toys you can play with. If you can\u2019t even afford to neuter the dog I assume you\u2019re not keeping up with regular vet visits either. In addition to letting your oldest smack the dog around and insisting on trying to pet a dog who is repeatedly telling you to leave it alone, he\u2019s intact and probably not even vaccinated. Dog is traumatized and your daughter will be too if you don\u2019t try actually taking care of the dog instead throwing him away.", "The dog is growling to tell you not to bother him. He only growls at the three of you because the three of you don't respect his boundaries and body language before that. You can't force a dog to accept physical touch or play. The dog will not be \"aggressive\" if you listen to it and respect it as the living being that it is.", "YTA this may be an unpopular opinion, but I do not care. Here goes, it is inhumane to get an animal that you cannot afford. Neutering a dog is the responsible pet owner thing to do (not in every circumstance, of course). Allowing poor animal behavior from your children presumably not teaching them differently to the point the dog feels threatened or afraid and growls when he started out happy is atrocious. This situation was created, and now your solution is to dump the dog because it is too time consuming or expensive? Good grief what happens if the dog needs to see the vet? OP you have no business being a pet owner. I am sad for your daughter and dog. Redeem yourself, fix this. Train the dog, and teach your children pet manners.", "YTA. A dog that starts off fine and then becomes agressive\u2026 though I see it as defensive warnings\u2026 has been abused by those he warns off to leave him alone. You even admit he was mistreated by the oldest, and now the youngest is yelling at it, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve not handled the dog properly either.", "YTA - so you refuse to neuter it, refuse to train it, no doubt refuse to have it checked over by a vet for a pain issue (common with this behaviour), and admit that you allowed your eldest to be \u2018rough\u2019 with the dog. \n\nOf course you are the asshole. I feel sorry for the dog, he deserves better.", "YTA. The dog is aggressive because you allowed your oldest to be aggressive with him. This is all on you.", "how long has it been since he started showing aggression?\n\nwhat have you done to reduce his aggressive behaviour/train him ? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nif you havent even tried training him then yeah your kinda TA you cant just expect him not to do something without training him and teaching him not to when he does - jumping straight to rehoming is kinda harsh\n\ngetting a dog means training it - why did you get a dog if you dont have the time ? sure you say your daughter got a dog but she was 14 and a lot of training ect would inc all of you", "YTA and I feel sorry for the dog more than I do your daughter.\n\nAlso, there are services that will provide neutering at a free or reduced cost. Make Bob Barker proud.", "YTA it is not the dog or Sarah's fault that you got a dog you weren't able/willing to care for and train properly.", "You knew!! that dog would need to be neutered. Enough with the excuses and putting it on a 16 year old.", "YTA\n\nYou, the oldest and youngest need to be trained on how to treat a dog. There is enough content to teach you dog body language, rehoming will only stress and depress the dog when you separate them from your 16 yo", "YTA.  Training the dog should have happened as he was growing and neuter at ~6 months would have been the path to take here.\n\nIf you\u2019re not willing to put the time and energy into raising a well balanced dog, don\u2019t get one.  I feel bad for Sarah, but this is a hard lesson for all of you to learn.\n\nDo not get another dog.  Once Sarah is old enough to obtain and raise a dog on her own that will be up to her.", "Yea you\u2019re the asshole neutering your dog and training classes are the basic minimum you need to provide for your dog if you can\u2019t do that you shouldn\u2019t have gotten a dog. Crazy how you blame the dog but haven\u2019t even bothered to neuter the dog or enroll it in behavior classes. YTA", "If the dog is aggressive then its becuase its people aren't respecting its boundries. Do you know why chihuahuas are deemed so \"agressive\"? Its because everyone treats them like theyre nothing but toys and dont leave them alone even when they growl. The world is so much bigger than them and theyre scared so they act out, and then they get hurt bc someone didnt understand they didnt wanted to be pet.\n\nYour dog growling bc u want to pet him is a clear sign HE DOESNT WANT TO BE PET. Respect your fucking dog ffs and dont touch him unless he wants it. Also your oldest being rough just being themselves? Thats stupid and i wouldnt be suprised if ur kid hurt the dog and realised the only way to stop getting hurt was to be aggressive. Like dogs can sense abusers miles away and know when a person is good bc they're kind, ur kid being a bully to the dog and then being suprised when it wont tolerate it? What do u expect.\n\nIts dog training 101, respect your dog and it will respect you, i have 3 dogs and when they growl at me i know to back away and give em space bc im not entitled to petting them when ever i feel like it. And they still love me and come to me for cuddles in the morning when i wake up bc i respect when they want attention and when they want space. \n\nDogs take effort, if you werent prepared to spend money on the dog and get it trained then why did u buy one? Yta for not thinking this through before you got a dog.", ">She wants to try training classes and says getting him neutered will help but all of that is expensive and time consuming.\n\nYep, YTA, and not at all prepared to have ANY dog. \nDogs ARE expensive and time consuming. If you're not willing to give that dog what it needs, you should not be allowed to have one. No wonder you're having so many issues.", "Yta!! It sounds like your oldest was abusive. As a parent you should\u2019ve corrected it.", "YTA, OP. I get the concern of money and time, but these are the commitments you make when you adopt a dog. I\u2019m of the belief that rehoming a dog should usually be your last option, and it does not sound to me like you have tried any other options. \n\nYour oldest is rough with the dog, and your youngest yells at him when he defends himself. This sounds like a stressful environment for your dog and while I\u2019m not a dog expert by any means, I think a good place to start would be addressing the behaviour of your oldest and youngest. Ask them to be more gentle with the dog. Have them try to build trust with him. No more being rough with him, and no more yelling. These things are free. \n\nI know you are looking out for your family but please understand that dogs require care and usually do not develop this behaviour without good reason, such as an environment where they feel unsafe. Best of luck to you!", "The problem isn\u2019t the dog. The problem is you and your oldest and youngest kids. You and your two other kids were petting a dog that does not like you- of course you\u2019re going to be growled at. He is not an aggressive dog: you and your children just have no boundaries and don\u2019t identify when the dog is uncomfortable. You wouldn\u2019t hug someone who doesn\u2019t like you and doesn\u2019t want to be touched, would you? If anyone is need of training, it\u2019s you and your two other kids.\n\nAlso you really need to get the dog neutered because whatever the cost is will be a lot less than caring for the many puppies it will help make. \n\nIf you insist on rehoming this dog, your daughter will likely resent you and her siblings for it since she has developed a strong bond with the dog.\n\nYTA", "Yes. The dog needs to warm up and it is your fault for letting them rough house with the dog. If you rehome the dog I cant even TELL you how many people are gonna hate you.

You and your children have no idea how to treat a dog (except the one). \n\nThe eldest plays aggressively with it then wonders why it doesn't like them.

Sounds like the dog has a good sense to know the bad people.", "YTA.\n\nThis is a MESS. I am so sad for Sarah and each of your kids here. \n\na few things:\n\n\n1. It is traumatic to both the dog and a child to re-home him. if you decide you can't keep him, please do not drop it at a shelter. please contact a breed specific rescue or the original source where the dog came from. Shelters are breeding grounds for disease and pathogens and trauma-the dog could get any number of parasites or diseases even if the shelter looks clean or nice. If you do re-home him, the attached child/family should get therapy as you'll all navigate this differently.\n\n\n2. Do you know ANYTHING at all about dog behavior? Lick lips, whale eyes, tail movement, etc. are ALL MASSIVE indicators of a dogs feelings. A wagging tail isn't always a joyful tail. You have to teach your kids to notice these signs and meet the dog where it's at. This stuff isn't rocket science but takes time to learn, more time if you have a high drive or breed with temperament issues. \n\n\n3. Stop telling it to NOT GROWL or you'll get a dog that bites without warning first. This is critical. When the dog growls, it's expressing a boundary. Your children should have learned this from YOU or a trainer before a dog came into the home. You tell it to stop and it could start lunging with no warning-you get into bite territory and the dog will likely end up euthanized due to owner error.\n\n\n4. If you don't have boundaries established like, \"No one pets the dog while it's sleeping, no one goes into the crate or on the dogs bed, EVER,  no one roughhouses, etc\" the dog is likely living in a constant flight mode and stress state. Violating a dogs boundaries and signals of discomfort is cruel. His behavior is an indicator of constant stress.\n\n\n5. This entire situation is so sad. No one needs to be home all day with a dog that was recently neutered if they have a cone on and are properly administered meds and taken out on a schedule. Your daughter seems too young to be the decision maker but she's been almost set up to feel failed in this situation. Getting a dog trained and fixed is part of the experience of being a good dog owner. It's unlikely neutering alone will resolve all of these behaviors. Depending on the dogs age and its hormonal maturity neutering may or may not affect temperament. Sigh.\n\n\n6. This entire situation makes me so sad. You have a chance as a parent, regardless of re-homing it or not, to do better and teach your children better and to tell the oldest ones where there was oversight. Teach your kids how to interact with boundaries with the dog NOW, even if you only have it a few more days. Teach them how to properly re-home a dog, not abandon it. Sit with them as they navigate huge emotions around this fiasco.\n\n\n\nTheres a lot more I could say, but wishing your family the best as you work your way out of this mess.\n\nEdited to add: if you go the trainer route, do find a positive reinforcement based trainer-no prong, shock methods. If you need help finding one or a low cost neuter clinic, reach out.", "YTA. A dog is not a \"when things are good\" purchase. The dog has been with you 2.5 years, why has it not already been neutered or trained? Why have you allowed your other children to be rough with it or yell at it?

It can't talk so growling is it's next level if you guys aren't reading it's body language. \n\nNeuter the dog, get the dog training, and stop your other children from messing with it. Training doesn't have to be done in a building or with a professional trainer, you can try starting off with videos and books, but if it's already to the point of growling at you all, a professional/class might be the best place to start.\n\nEdit: a shelter is not technically \"rehoming\". Giving the dog to the shelter is just giving the dog away. Rehoming would be you taking time out of your oh-so precious schedule and searching for someone who could take the dog.

At first, it was great. He\u2019s adorable and smart and a little feisty. My kids loved him. \n\nHe eventually became close with only Sarah and my husband, likes me but not nearly as much as Sarah or my husband, tolerates my youngest, and hates my oldest. Sarah blames it on my oldest being mean to him at first but she was just playing rough. She\u2019s rough with everything though so it\u2019s not like she was trying to be mean to him. \n\nHe started to show aggression towards my oldest and youngest. If my oldest goes too close to him he\u2019ll growl at her. My youngest yells at him for growling at the oldest and he growls at the youngest in response. He\u2019s never bitten any of them but he has snapped a couple times. \n\nYesterday he kept growling at me, my oldest, and my youngest until Sarah picked him up and took him to her room. We weren\u2019t doing anything to him except trying to pet him. I decided we need to rehome this dog and try again later. I found a good shelter but Sarah is refusing to let him go. She wants to try training classes and says getting him neutered will help but all of that is expensive and time consuming. Most training classes want an adult to go and I\u2019m busy between work and 3 kids. They\u2019re also expensive and it\u2019s not like Sarah can afford these classes. Same with neutering. We\u2019ve called around and the vets around us charge at least $400, then there\u2019s the recovery and we can\u2019t stay home with him after. I think rehoming him is the best thing for the family but Sarah is a wreck and cries every time it\u2019s brought up. She\u2019s threatening to hide the dog from us so we can\u2019t rehome him, which I think is stupid and childish. \n\nMy husband was okay with rehoming him but now is on her side so I just wanted to know if I was the asshole.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

These are not necessarily signs of aggression \u2014 I\u2019d hazard that these are the dog\u2019s way of trying to establish boundaries. Your oldest \u201cplaying rough\u201d with him doesn\u2019t magically not have consequences just because she\u2019s \u201crough with everything\u201d and wasn\u2019t *intending* to be mean or cruel.

Sarah could learn to train the dog on her own if training classes are too expensive, but you *really* should get him neutered. Low cost clinics are out there, and sometimes shelters are able to offer that service for cheaper.

Male dogs do not require a lot of recovery time after neutering. If your finances are such that $400 is a burden, there are also low-cost spay and neuter clinics.\n\nFourth, I suspect that if you ask around enough, you will find a trainer willing to work with a 16-year old.

Punish the dog for behavior you don\u2019t like INSTANTLY when it does it. Say NO at the same time in a firm commanding voice. If you have to give the dog a smack or something to get it to stop that\u2019s fine but don\u2019t hit the dog cause you\u2019re mad. It\u2019s counter productive. At the same time, you must give the dog positive reinforcement when it does not display the behavior in the form of praise and/or treats.

It\u2019s happened to me around 13 times for various reasons. You don\u2019t get an animal and just rehome it because it has problems. You wouldn\u2019t rehome your youngest child if they were being aggressive and biting and yelling and kicking, so why would it be the same with a furry member of the family?

In general, most people who rehome dogs suck, but there are definitely cases where it's better for the dog. I think this is one of them. I doubt the mom will realize how terrible they've been and actually change their ways and that is why I think the dog should be rehomed. Granted, the mom is probably just going to drop it off at the pound, but hopefully they can get it to a rescue or put effort into rehoming it to a good family.\n\nI know someone that rehomed a dog they felt was aggressive.

Owners knew what the triggers were, etc. Worked with a trainer, but unfortunately weren't successful.\n* owners wanted to start a family, but couldn't trust the dog with little children. they never expected their dog to have aggression issues, did what they could to overcome those issues, but weren't successful.\n* decided to rehome the dog, but wanted to ensure it went to a good home. they didn't drop it off at the pound. they shared the dog's history and explained their reasonings for rehoming. for anyone interested, they wanted to meet with them, make sure they would be able to accommodate their dog's aggression, etc.", "Yes, there are some dogs that are born with neurological disorders that make them vicious, however, the majority of dog attacks happen because irresponsible pet owners don\u2019t take the time to train and socialize their pets.", "The dog is only aggressive because OP, her eldest and her youngest hurt and abuse it.

Your dog has killed and injured that many animals and you are still making excuses?? First of all, equating rehoming animals to children is disgusting. Animals are not children.
