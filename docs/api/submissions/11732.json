I still don't want to put an adult problem onto my kids, so I only gave them a brief overview of the dire financial issues we're having after my husband/their father passed away. Us downsizing to a 1 bedroom apartment was not by choice.\n\nI also told them the truth about how I couldn't afford to feed us all and why I didn't eat 2 days of the week. I was afraid of how they would take the news, but it had gone better than I expected. My kids will be coming with me to the food bank for the next trip to help out.\n\nIn terms of the rooming situation, both my older kids agreed that they did not want to share a room with my youngest 2F because she frequently wakes up at night and also has accidents. They also don't want to share with me because I get up much earlier than them to work, and it would disrupt their sleep. They would rather share the room with each other while I continue to sleep in the living room with my youngest.\n\nMy 16M and 14F told me that their friends were saying no kid should ever have to watch their sibling because they didn't create them. They've been told by their friends that it's parentification to be asked to babysit for even an hour, and it is never okay in any circumstance. That was why they kept calling me an asshole when I asked if they could help with childcare so I could get a 2nd job. \n\nNow that they know how bad the situation is, my son said he wants to find a part time job to help contribute. My daughter apologized and said it wasn't that she hated me or her sister. Both my son and daughter said they are willing to help take care of the youngest so I can get a 2nd job. Hopefully, I can find something soon and be able to move to a larger space.", "created_utc": 1678218819, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11l9dev/aita_for_making_my_teen_16m_and_14f_share_a/", "score": 919, "replies": ["good luck op\n\nwere rooting for you.", "I'm glad you told your children the truth.

By being part of the solution, it will help them to feel like they have some control over their circumstances and therefore, their lives, and that is important for them right now. \n\nAlso, just my opinion, it is parentification if you are expecting them to be pseudo-parents that are de facto responsible for their siblings on a regular basis, and also without acknowledging that they aren't in fact the adult in the situation. This can happen even when they aren't asked to babysit, but being yelled at for something that was actually the parents' responsibility.

It's being a second or third parent to ur sibling(s). My parents agree that they unintentionally prarentified me. I made sure my brother was dressed, teeth brushed, showered, eat 3 meals a day, packed his lunch, helped him with his homework, etc. I took care of the house. I was making dinner for my mom and brother at the age of 7. I cleaned the house. Did the laundry. I was an emotional support person for both parents and so on. \n\n\n\nThat is parentification.

I get a lot of people telling me I was parentified and therefore abused, but like, shit, my mom was widowed shortly after a huge amount of life turmoil and desperately needed help with my brother while managing her grief, post-death legalities, and career. I probably would have come out a different person if we hadn't gone through that, but that's worlds away from someone who was parentified through different circumstances", "Why did they had 2 kids if they weren't able to take care of them both?

Now I have my own two kids and they never have to babysit each other unless one of them wants to and it's always for a price, not free.
