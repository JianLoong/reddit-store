I still don't want to put an adult problem onto my kids, so I only gave them a brief overview of the dire financial issues we're having after my husband/their father passed away. Us downsizing to a 1 bedroom apartment was not by choice.\n\nI also told them the truth about how I couldn't afford to feed us all and why I didn't eat 2 days of the week. I was afraid of how they would take the news, but it had gone better than I expected. My kids will be coming with me to the food bank for the next trip to help out.\n\nIn terms of the rooming situation, both my older kids agreed that they did not want to share a room with my youngest 2F because she frequently wakes up at night and also has accidents. They also don't want to share with me because I get up much earlier than them to work, and it would disrupt their sleep. They would rather share the room with each other while I continue to sleep in the living room with my youngest.\n\nMy 16M and 14F told me that their friends were saying no kid should ever have to watch their sibling because they didn't create them. They've been told by their friends that it's parentification to be asked to babysit for even an hour, and it is never okay in any circumstance. That was why they kept calling me an asshole when I asked if they could help with childcare so I could get a 2nd job. \n\nNow that they know how bad the situation is, my son said he wants to find a part time job to help contribute. My daughter apologized and said it wasn't that she hated me or her sister. Both my son and daughter said they are willing to help take care of the youngest so I can get a 2nd job. Hopefully, I can find something soon and be able to move to a larger space.", "created_utc": 1678218819, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11l9dev/aita_for_making_my_teen_16m_and_14f_share_a/", "score": 10499, "replies": ["good luck op\n\nwere rooting for you.", "I'm glad you told your children the truth.

By being part of the solution, it will help them to feel like they have some control over their circumstances and therefore, their lives, and that is important for them right now. \n\nAlso, just my opinion, it is parentification if you are expecting them to be pseudo-parents that are de facto responsible for their siblings on a regular basis, and also without acknowledging that they aren't in fact the adult in the situation. This can happen even when they aren't asked to babysit, but being yelled at for something that was actually the parents' responsibility.

I was making dinner for my mom and brother at the age of 7. I cleaned the house. Did the laundry. I was an emotional support person for both parents and so on. \n\n\n\nThat is parentification.

There were a few Christmases where I fronted my parents money to get gifts for my younger siblings, and they paid me back later with tax money. It sounds crazy, but I was truly honored to be in a position to help them after seeing them fight so hard to get back to stability after the market crash in 07/08. Even if it was babysitting and nannying money, it helped them, and it gave me a healthy understanding that this hyper individualized western idea of family doesn\u2019t work when the family has to come together to get through trials. \n\nYou are a GOOD mom. \n\nPlease dm me so I can at least make a grocery pick up order to fill the gaps the food bank doesn\u2019t cover.

This way he doesn\u2019t have to go outside the home, and if he chooses can put that money into the household or to pay for a treat for himself. That way he won\u2019t feel parentified and if his school friends try and say anything he can use it as a way to be, \u201coh I\u2019m getting paid to babysit, this is awesome\u201d so it doesn\u2019t affect him socially.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s great he\u2019s willing to step up and that both children understand the situation a bit better now.

This doesn\u2019t mean regular babysitting, even if unpaid, but when a child is expected to take over routine tasks  for other children on a daily basis (ensuring they\u2019ve eaten, are bathed and are asleep and/or holding them responsible for the behaviour of other children) or are expected to provide the emotional support to those children (comforting them when upset because the parents are physically or emotionally unavailable)\n\n2. When the role of parent and child are inverted and parents expect the children to emotionally support them in the way a parent should support a child. This can include involving the child in marital issues in an age and relationship inappropriate way, expecting the child to comfort the parent in distress and essentially put the emotional needs of the parent first. \n\nParentification is a form of abuse and creates trauma in children. My siblings and I are in our 40s and still trying to unpack the way in which our parents\u2019 parentification has warped bothe our relationships with each other and others in our lives. And we didn\u2019t even really have it bad. There was no physical neglect, just emotionally immature parents who were never emotionally present. It can be a lot worse. \n\nSo all those kids screaming \u2018parentification\u2019 because they had to look after their siblings for an hour need to sit the hell down.

No one is saying expecting your kids to clean their bedroom or do the dishes is making them a parent or causing trauma, but expecting them to be solely responsible for cleaning the entire house, cooking, dishes, and laundry is.\n\nAnd one of the key points here is that your parentifying your kid when you're forcing them to provide support for the *parent* rather than receiving it.
