Neither parent handled the divorce well and they refused to be in the same room as one another. As a result, I grew up having separate holidays, birthdays etc with each parent. \n\nMy mom had primary custody, so I spent the majority of my childhood and adolescence with her. I have never had a close relationship with my SM. I don\u2019t talk to her outside of major gatherings and see her maybe 4-5 times a year). My mom and SM/dad live 5 minutes from each other, so distance isn\u2019t a factor. \n\nMy DH (also 32) and I got married last year. It was the first major event that everyone had to attend and play nice at. \nMy mom and dad both promised me that it was my day and they had no issues being around each other for it. They even offered to do a combined speech.\n\nI invited my SM and SS to get ready with the girls and my SM told me that she would be uncomfortable getting ready in a room with my mom, so I assumed they didn\u2019t want to attend this portion. SM then she would be highly offended if I took a photo with my bio family (parents and brothers) because she\u2019s my dad\u2019s wife, my mom isn\u2019t. After this conversation I had major anxiety because it was clear she was was struggling with insecurities and I was trying to make everyone happy. \n\nI \u201cOK\u2019d\u201d everything with SM - the parents of the bride speech, the slideshow (containing childhood photos with both parents), I even had SM and mom sitting at separate tables, facing away from each other. I put in every effort possible to have a drama free day and make everyone comfortable. \n\nAfter the wedding SM told me that I should have done more to include her. I told her about all the effort I put in to make HER comfortable on MY day. She said my efforts weren\u2019t good enough and I should have treated her equally to my mom. She was offended that all the girls got ready together and SM and SS weren\u2019t invited. I reminded her that I did invite them and she told me she wasn\u2019t comfortable being around my mom. We had a huge fight and SM kept bringing up the past and bad mouthing my mom. I asked if they could respect my boundaries and leave me out of any drama they had with my mom. SM threw it back in my face because \u2018now she can\u2019t express her feelings to me\u2019. My DH and I ended up kicking them out of our house after boundaries were ignored. \n\nNow we are 7 months pregnant with twins (first grandbabies) and they have been excluded from all celebrations (gender reveal, baby shower etc). It\u2019s been made clear that SM doesn\u2019t want to be around mom, and I\u2019m not going out of my way to accommodate her after the wedding fiasco. \nMy dad has made it clear that he won\u2019t attend any events without SM, so he\u2019s been excluded by default. I told my dad that if they want to be a part of the grandkids\u2019 lives then we can do separate celebrations, but mom will be attending the big celebrations as she is much more integrated in my life. \n\nAITA for telling my dad he won\u2019t be invited to major events?", "created_utc": 1676770886, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115y5dv/aita_for_telling_my_dad_and_stepmom_they_will_not/", "score": 190, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They are the older adults and responsible for acting as such. SM is so selfish it\u2019s cringy.

She is nothing more than your dad\u2019s wife. You are too old for a SM you have never had a real relationship with. She\u2019s not grandma because your children have a living grandmother.

She wasn't equal to your mom on your wedding day because...  she's NOT your mom. I think your dad has made his choice as well. \n\nSometimes these things happen for the best.

I've had to keep my own kids away from their narcissistic grandparents too.", "NTA. you didn\u2019t tell him he wouldn\u2019t be invited.

This photo was about the bio family, your mum and dad presumably wouldn't have had to stand together as happy family in this photo.\n\nThen your SM complains about the pre-wedding preps with the 'girls' when it was her choice to exclude herself.\n\nIt sounds like your SM is trying really hard to replace your mum in every facet of your life and you certainly don't have to put up with her BS if that's not how you want.\n\nIf your dad doesn't see what's happening in front of his eyes - or not hearing it because SM is complaining when he's not around then you need to tell him why you're setting these boundaries.  From then on if he decides not to come to these events that's entirely up to him and its a HIM problem and not a YOU problem\n\nAlso, personally I wouldn't be going to the trouble of separate events just to cater to your SM and her bitchy and jealous behavior.
