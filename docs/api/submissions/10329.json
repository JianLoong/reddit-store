Neither parent handled the divorce well and they refused to be in the same room as one another. As a result, I grew up having separate holidays, birthdays etc with each parent. \n\nMy mom had primary custody, so I spent the majority of my childhood and adolescence with her. I have never had a close relationship with my SM. I don\u2019t talk to her outside of major gatherings and see her maybe 4-5 times a year). My mom and SM/dad live 5 minutes from each other, so distance isn\u2019t a factor. \n\nMy DH (also 32) and I got married last year. It was the first major event that everyone had to attend and play nice at. \nMy mom and dad both promised me that it was my day and they had no issues being around each other for it. They even offered to do a combined speech.\n\nI invited my SM and SS to get ready with the girls and my SM told me that she would be uncomfortable getting ready in a room with my mom, so I assumed they didn\u2019t want to attend this portion. SM then she would be highly offended if I took a photo with my bio family (parents and brothers) because she\u2019s my dad\u2019s wife, my mom isn\u2019t. After this conversation I had major anxiety because it was clear she was was struggling with insecurities and I was trying to make everyone happy. \n\nI \u201cOK\u2019d\u201d everything with SM - the parents of the bride speech, the slideshow (containing childhood photos with both parents), I even had SM and mom sitting at separate tables, facing away from each other. I put in every effort possible to have a drama free day and make everyone comfortable. \n\nAfter the wedding SM told me that I should have done more to include her. I told her about all the effort I put in to make HER comfortable on MY day. She said my efforts weren\u2019t good enough and I should have treated her equally to my mom. She was offended that all the girls got ready together and SM and SS weren\u2019t invited. I reminded her that I did invite them and she told me she wasn\u2019t comfortable being around my mom. We had a huge fight and SM kept bringing up the past and bad mouthing my mom. I asked if they could respect my boundaries and leave me out of any drama they had with my mom. SM threw it back in my face because \u2018now she can\u2019t express her feelings to me\u2019. My DH and I ended up kicking them out of our house after boundaries were ignored. \n\nNow we are 7 months pregnant with twins (first grandbabies) and they have been excluded from all celebrations (gender reveal, baby shower etc). It\u2019s been made clear that SM doesn\u2019t want to be around mom, and I\u2019m not going out of my way to accommodate her after the wedding fiasco. \nMy dad has made it clear that he won\u2019t attend any events without SM, so he\u2019s been excluded by default. I told my dad that if they want to be a part of the grandkids\u2019 lives then we can do separate celebrations, but mom will be attending the big celebrations as she is much more integrated in my life. \n\nAITA for telling my dad he won\u2019t be invited to major events?", "created_utc": 1676770886, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115y5dv/aita_for_telling_my_dad_and_stepmom_they_will_not/", "score": 2589, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When I got married, my dad had been married to my SM for over 18 years (and they are still married). When planning the wedding I realized she had deep insecurities regarding my mom and had to try to accommodate her, and nothing was enough. In my culture, traditional wedding invitations include the parents names. That was issue number one, as my mom still carries my dad's last name. I told my dad he had had over 20 years to discuss this with my mom and even pay her a lawyer to get it back to her maiden name, but he never did. I eventually caved, and with my mom's okay I had  her last name changed on the invitations.\n\nThen came the weeding day. I thought everything was fine, but only after the fact I learned that I \"almost ruined my dad's relationship\" and it had been \"the worst day\" for my SM. She was part of the wedding party and walked down the aisle with my brother (where I come from the wedding party walks in pairs as couples and stand around the bride and groom at the altar). She felt bad because she was not the first couple of the wedding party to walk down the aisle. I explained that I didn't define the order, the wedding planner just did it randomly as it was not a popularity contest for me. She didn't buy it. Then at the altar she couldn't stand for the ceremony next to my brother while my mom was next to my dad and they switched. She was so distraught that she was badmouthing me during the bloody ceremony to another bridesmaid. Then came the party. I had the venue set up 2 tables for bride, groom and family, so to accommodate my siblings as well. Apparently one of the tables had only 6 chairs instead of 8 as the other tables, and my in-laws and mom and brother were already sitting, leaving only 2 empty seats for me and my husband. She had a meltdown and my FIL ran to find some extra chairs for them. She was absolutely sure I did all of those things in purpose to humiliate her. After learning about all the drama and her refusing to believe that none of those things were planned or even had a malicious intent to hurt her, I decided that I didn't need a toxic person like that being relevant in my life. So now I just tolerate her. When I visit I am always  civil and pleasant; she has stayed at my home (we live now in different countries) with my dad, and is always well treated. I don't badmouth her to my children who consider her a grandmom. But I honestly have no feelings for her, I don't reach out to chat, I don't respond if she says she loves me.

She wouldn't wear the special corsage I'd gotten for her. \n\nShe died 15 or so years later and never really forgave me for not excluding my mother.\n\n(For the record, my mother had full custody my entire childhood. My father and mother had long stopped being mad at each other by then and took pictures with me and were very friendly. My stepmother and my mom were friendly. It was literally just my grandmother who had issues.)", "My best friends mother in law is like that.  Her husband is youngest of four and the wedding weekend was a bizarre study of dysfunction down to a science.  \n\nThey were kept separate at all times, they couldn\u2019t invite their stepmother and stepsisters despite the fact they\u2019ve been in their life since they were small.  \n\nBoth parents are honestly just awful people who lack empathy.

Your father is going for the path of least resistance.  It\u2019s easier FOR HIM if you placate your stepmother.\n\nHe cares about you and being part of your life up until the point it inconveniences him in any way.\n\nHold firm to boundaries,  your mother gets the events and milestones and he and stepmother get the leftovers if that.  Boundaries are for your peace of mind. If even that is too stressful for you than too bad so sad for him.\n\nYou went above and beyond for your stepmother.  She didn\u2019t appreciate it now she gets nothing.", "Hmmm at one point I was told I have a sizeable inheritance. I haven\u2019t talked to my dad about it in 10 years or so.

I would prefer my dad around so I\u2019ve never been concerned about it, and my Hubs and I do well for ourselves. \n\nIf my dad has moved everything over to SM to distribute I would assume that I wouldn\u2019t get anything.

I'm sorry she made things hard on your wedding day.\n\nEDIT: phrasing.", "Thank you!", "Well, it is his decision. The host decides who to invite, and there is no obligation to invite toxic people, who would create drama and would spoil the event for everybody .

It is better to protect the children from this toxicity.", "I have seen tactics like the SM's coming from the biological mother when it was the SM who broke up the marriage. Being very bitter, refusing to be in the same room with her ex's new wife, etc.\n\nIn those cases I think it is somewhat understandable (especially if the divorce is relatively fresh) but that the mother should be able to contain their bitterness for one day and put their daughter first on her wedding day.\n\nINFO: But what is the SM's back story?\n\nDid she and the OP's mom have a literal knock-down drag out fight at some time in the past?\n\nDid she break up OP's parent's marriage and now she thinks that OP's dad wants to get back together with the mom? She sounds like a jealous shrew (especially with regards to no family pictures).\n\nOr did she snag OP's dad for the lifestyle only to resent OP's mom because OP's mom was getting child support (and potentially alimony) and cutting into her golden lifestyle?", "I got to agree with that otherwise he would just leave the wife at home and enjoy the celebrations!", "I think that you dropped this : \ud83d\udc51", "She has recently started going to therapy, so I will give her kudos there.

But just because she's working on herself doesn't mean she's making things right with you. \n\nAnd your dad is wrong. It's not your job to keep letting her rain on your parade, especially when you should be focused on this amazing next step in your life. If you need to disengage, please do so. Your health and the kids health are the *only* thing you should be focusing on, not her ongoing drama.", "Wow. Just\u2026.. wow. NTA.

Your dad needs to grow a spine.", "NTA- Stop accommodating everyone it is what it is. Your SM can either put on her big girl panties and deal or stay home dont keep the tradition of separate events for all parties concerned if they aren't trying to consider your feelings in everything then let them stay home, less aggravation and BS.

Unless there was past abuse or something unforgiveable everyone involved needs to adult up and do the polite thing of saying \"Hello\" and then ignoring the fuck out of the person they dislike.", "NTA.  SM is.  And Dad is for cowing to her.  Good for you for having those boundaries. But moving forward, for your own sanity, I wouldn't even entertain the idea of separate events.  Having separate events accommodates your SM. Your first holiday season this year,  if you have separate events, you will  be driving to multiple locations, likely on the same day, and towing two kids, and bottles, and car seats and all the other crap that babies need.  By the end, you and your husband will be exhausted and miserable because you won't be able to make everyone happy because Dad/ SM are never happy.  So don't accommodate them.   You will have the babies, you make the schedule. Stick to your original statement.  You're not accommodating SM. If what you decide on doesn't work for Dad/SM because Mom is there, too bad for them.  You can arrange for Dad to come to your house when it's convenient for you.  Dad will figure out a way to be more flexible, because he will want to see those babies.", "Absolutely NTA. You went out of your way to make SM, a woman you barely have a relationship with, feel welcome and included in your wedding and she acted like a spoiled child and is continuing to do so.

Dad is a grown man and he is capable of making his own choices and he'll just have to live with the outcome of those choices.", "Good grief. Are you talking about my SMIL? She was uncomfortable being in the same place as my MIL at any time.

Jealous much??", "NTA.\n\nI don't even understand why you are going out of your way to accommodate your Step mom when she is clearly a toxic person who is playing her own sick ego games, ignoring your boundaries and I'm sure she is clearly aware that her actions are wedging a distance between a father and her daughter. I think you've done enough for her. Now the ball is in their court. If they want to have a relationship with you and your family that you are creating, they should be the ones to be more respectful, apologize for past misconduct and take the first step towards healing. \n\nYour Step mom's insecurities aren't your problems.
