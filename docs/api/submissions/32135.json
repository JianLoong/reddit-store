You told him no already and then he booked the appointment with that specific tattoo as a 'surprise' and tried to guilt-trip you into it before accusing you of not being committed to him when you didn't fall for it.

End of story\n\nSecondly, it is common knowledge, that a tattoo like that is more often than not regretted. Sure, its romantic and all, but no one can predict the future and shit happens. Most couples are in a relation with the intent to stay together and most dont. \n\nListen to all the tattooed people here, who have been with their partner for ages and still would not get a tattoo like that! (Myself included)", "NTA Every single couple I have ever known to get a tattoo of each other's names or initials, regardless of age and amount of time in a relationship together, have always broken up within a month afterward. Without fail, every single time. Hell, one of my former neighbors and his wife was in their 70s. Had been married for something like 40 years. He went and got a tattoo of her name on his shoulder for their anniversary. A couple weeks later, I was talking to him and asked about his wife because I hadn't seen her around recently. I was honestly expecting the worst. Nope. She cheated on him with a man half her age just after he got the tattoo so he kicked her out. In my opinion, it's like inviting a break up into your relationship. This rings especially true since only one person got it, so now he will be resenting you for not doing the same for him. Add to this the fact that you two are so young and haven't been together for very long, plus the fact that he is accusing you of not being as committed to him simply for having foresight of the future...this is honestly a recipe for disaster. In my opinion, if you were to get the tattoo, you would not only regret it and resent yourself for it, but it would also either be with you forever, or you'd have to pay a substantial amount ((plus the pain involved with the procedure)) to get it removed.\n\nEdit: Oh, plus it's a bad sign that he tried to pressure you into doing something you had already made clear you didn't want to do. Double points for that thing being permanent in most cases. I know I already mentioned that, but it resonates with this point, as well.", "not tha AH. I have tattoos. I have my daughters name on me. I do not have my partners name or initials on me.

He is throwing up some bright red flags here. Keep your eyes wide open. NTA.", "NTA but \"said I just wasn\u2019t interested in having tattoos in general\" so his response is to...book you a tattoo appointment?  This is a red flag of potentially bigger issues - not respecting your choice, your bodily autonomy, trying to blame you for not doing what he wants, trying to guilt you into doing something you very clearly said you were not going to do.\n\nAt any age, that's a problem, but at 18/19, it's even more concerning.", "NTA. You told him the first time you discussed it that you weren\u2019t interested in getting a tattoo. He was hoping to manipulate you into getting it anyway by booking the appointment and getting his first. \n\nGood for you for standing your ground and not giving in to the guilt trip. All he\u2019s doing is proving himself too immature and manipulative to be worth having tattooed, imo. This relationship isn\u2019t going to last. \n\nAlso I don\u2019t know what your interactions at the shop were like, but most reputable artists would refuse to tattoo someone\u2019s initials on you unless they were 100% sure you wanted them.

Idk if that was some kind of declaration of importance to him? Anyway, it turned out he was cheating on me, so I absolutely should have agreed to get matching tattoos and then backed out after he had his.", "NTA, me and my ex wanted to get our anniversary. She got hers across her wrist but my godfather was doing my tattoo and told me he\u2019d just work it in inbetween the hair on one of my current ones just in case. \n\nFast forward 6 years and we\u2019ve been broken up for 2-3. Now we both have a constant reminder of a failed relationship lmao luckily mine is much smaller", "Dude you\u2019re teenagers. If you go 2 years that\u2019s considered a long time. Teenage relationships are wild.", "NTA. The only possible way this could count as a \"yta\" would be if it stood for \"you're the adult.\" You have been straightforward, consistent, and honest the entire time. His getting mad is just another way of saying he isn't mature yet.", "NTA. You\u2019re right. If he wants commitment forever, then why hasn\u2019t he popped the question? Why hasn\u2019t he married you? Anything can change. I\u2019m 40 and my husband is 37, been married for 17 years. We\u2019ve thought about tattoos but nope. At any age, something could go wrong and you\u2019d end up divorced. If he wanted to then good for him. You have the right to choose and tattoos are not your thing and that\u2019s okay.", "NTA.  He can tattoo what he wants, but he has no right to expect you to ink your body.  Next time tell them that your real initials are \"DNR\".", "NTA- you told him you didn't want to so the conversation should have ended there. It isn't your fault that he chose to call your bluff and go on with his. He is definitely the AH and if I were you, I would reconsider this relationship since he decided to gaslight you for letting him get his. His body, his choice. Your body, your choice. Plain and simple. Get a better man who respects your boundaries, Sis. \u2764\ufe0f", "I would think your BF did this on his own free will. I would never put a BF or husband's name, etc, on me. Things change through the years.", "Nta, you said in the beg8ning you didn't want to do it, and he chose to try to force you to do it by booking an appointment without your knowledge or consent. Then, gets all pissy because , shocker, you didn't do what you said you didn't want to do. Huge red flag and is definitely a sign he may be controlling. Run to the nearest exit and don't look back.", "Please don't be dumb enough to tattoo your bf's initials on you when you are 18.  Just.. no. NTA", "Im 59 and I have 2 tattoos. There is no way I would EVER get anyone's name or initials on my body other than my children. There are so many people I know that have had these mistakes removed or covered it's ridiculous. Never have I seen a relationship work out after this has been done. My own son has a lovely dragon that used to be some unhinged girls name. Removal is painful and takes about a year. NTA.", "No, don\u2019t feel mean, stand your ground, body autonomy is a thing in this case too. No one should get a tattoo if they don\u2019t want one.\n\nAnd honestly, this behavior from your boyfriend is a red flag for me -you already told him you didn\u2019t want a tattoo, and then he books not only a time for you to get a tattoo as a quote surprise\u201d but he has also decided what that tattoo will be\u2026 that\u2019s a lot.", "As someone who has a tattoo of my ex, don\u2019t. It\u2019s my biggest regret", "NTA. Your bf is a moron.", "NTA. You sound like you're a good few years further on as far as maturity goes than he is, in fact if anything, he is regressing. \nI also live in the UK. My wife and I both have tattoos, although neither of us have names or anything symbolic of each other tattooed on us. That's why we got married, and have rings. Branding yourself with someone's name or initial is quite a tacky thing to do, in my opinion, with the exception of offspring. \nAnyway, you're NTA, because you told him you weren't interested in getting a tattoo of anything, much less his initial, and he booked it anyway. Saying no to something doesn't make you sn AH. But you may wish to re-evaluate what kind of relationship you have with this guy, if he thinks you're going to be pressured into stuff", "You\u2019re the smart one. Don\u2019t do it", "NTA - really sketch (and by sketch I mean manipulative) of your bf to get the tattoo thinking you\u2019d be guilted into doing the same. I understand wanting young love to last forever, but it\u2019s also not a betrayal or a sign that you aren\u2019t currently committed to him and the idea of being with him forever that you have a perfectly reasonable boundary that he\u2019s taken offense to. You\u2019re the one being normal and well-adjusted about this, he\u2019s acting insecure and immature. \n\nI tattooed myself on a particularly not sober night with an ex of mine, who was desperately suggesting tattoo ideas that would represent our (like 5 month long?) relationship\u2026 only for him to dump me 2 months later. I am eternally grateful I decided NOT to take any of his suggestions and simply stabbed a lil smiley face into my skin instead.\n\nYou had even previously told him (gently, but clearly) that you weren\u2019t keen on the idea because you don\u2019t want tattoos in general. He\u2019s the AH for trying to give you a PERMANENT \u201cgift\u201d that was something you\u2019d directly said you did not want in the past. \n\nMaybe not an irredeemable AH because like I said, his actions reek of insecurity\u2026 which can be overcome if you\u2019re able to communicate about it. But if he won\u2019t take you at your word and continues to be a poor sport about his own stupid act of trying to manipulate you into easing his insecurity by permanently tattooing his initials onto your skin when you don\u2019t even want any tattoos to begin with rather than\u2026 I don\u2019t know, maybe just having a conversation about how he has things (whatever they are) that make him feel insecure in your relationship\u2026 I\u2019d get out of there before he lets his insecurity continue to manifest itself in stupid manipulative games meant to break your boundaries. \n\nYou\u2019re under no obligation in a relationship, EVER, to put aside any and all boundaries you have for your significant other, and it\u2019s a little alarming that he was willing to go to the lengths of getting YOUR initials tattooed on himself in an attempt to get you to do the same.", "NTA, him booking you guys into a tattoo studio as a \"surprise\" is weird asf. Red flag. You seem like the older one, not him.", "NTA - should have tattooed a huge red flag instead", "Even boomers know you don't get a name tattooed on you. NTA. But your boyfriend should know that a tattoo says nothing about commitment levels.", "Sooo\n\nYou let him know that you don't want tattoos\n\nAnd he takes this as a \"i will book a tattoo appointment, drive her to the tattoo shop, and try to force her to get 1 like this\"\n\nWhen that fails he is like \"i will get the tattoo first, that way the guilt might force her to get the tattoo\"\n\nWhen even that fails he starts being the victim?!??\n\nGirl, none of this is normal behavior \n\nWhat else is he trying to force you to do??", "So NTA. Really, that kind of behavior from your boyfriend is extremely troubling. You deserve better than that.", "I(21F) have been with my finace for almost 5 years now. We have both agreed it dumb to get out initials on each other because of the what if. However we do think couple tattoos are fucking legit. So we decided that when we are ready or as a wedding present we will get \"matching tattoos\" you won't know they match until you see them together. They also will have personal meaning. So if we break up it's not like I have his name on me or anything. This is just so dumb. You're NTA but your BF is", "It\u2019s almost certainly a bad decision. Your very unlikely to regret not getting it done IMO", "NTA", "NTA! \n\nYou communicated that you\u2019re not interested in getting tattoos period not just his initials but anything on your body permanently and he dismissed that it\u2019s his problem is he feel some kind of way because you already told him how you felt when he FIRSTT mentioned it to you", "NTA, you said no multiple times and he went through with it still. End of story", "You\u2019re NTA. I\u2019m 19, as is my partner, and neither of us would pressure the other to get a tattoo, let alone our initials/names. He shouldn\u2019t have booked for a tattoo when you already told him no, no matter the reason. And if he did get it to make you feel guilty? Even worse.\n\nIf he\u2019s repeatedly crossed your boundaries and hasn\u2019t respected when you say no, have a conversation about it with him. If he still doesn\u2019t respect your boundaries, he doesn\u2019t deserve your companionship.\n\nAnother alternative, if you do decide you want matching couples tattoos, is to just get something like each other\u2019s favorite animals or do those other matching tattoos for friends/couples. But don\u2019t feel the need to. You still have a long life ahead of you and you should get a tattoo if/when you are ready and when you want it. Rule #1 of tattoos: Never get someone\u2019s name or face\n\nGood luck !", "Nta it\u2019s your body and your choice and your life to live with it on you til you die and your flesh rots away. I would never want a tattoo either. I think they look terrible as well.

Then he made appointments anyways. You said no again. And he then went through with his, but is mad you didn't bow down to his pressure. THAT'S mean. \n\nWhy isn't he committed enough that he listens to you? And isn't committed enough to trust your feelings for him without a tattoo?", "Heck no, NTA. Why hasn't he proposed if he's so \"committed\"? He just wants to pressure you into getting the tattoo, maybe because he thinks it's cute, or maybe to prevent other guys from flirting with you.\n\nIt's absolutely insane for someone to be mad at you because you won't permanently alter your body in the way they want.", "I cracked up so hard \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Seriously, everyone I know that has done this ended up breaking up or divorced. \n\nI am 40 and have been with my partner for 15 years.

He should focus on that instead of \u201cromantic\u201d gestures. This only works if both agree on.
