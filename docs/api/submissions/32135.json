You told him no already and then he booked the appointment with that specific tattoo as a 'surprise' and tried to guilt-trip you into it before accusing you of not being committed to him when you didn't fall for it.

End of story\n\nSecondly, it is common knowledge, that a tattoo like that is more often than not regretted. Sure, its romantic and all, but no one can predict the future and shit happens. Most couples are in a relation with the intent to stay together and most dont. \n\nListen to all the tattooed people here, who have been with their partner for ages and still would not get a tattoo like that! (Myself included)", "NTA Every single couple I have ever known to get a tattoo of each other's names or initials, regardless of age and amount of time in a relationship together, have always broken up within a month afterward. Without fail, every single time. Hell, one of my former neighbors and his wife was in their 70s. Had been married for something like 40 years. He went and got a tattoo of her name on his shoulder for their anniversary. A couple weeks later, I was talking to him and asked about his wife because I hadn't seen her around recently. I was honestly expecting the worst. Nope. She cheated on him with a man half her age just after he got the tattoo so he kicked her out. In my opinion, it's like inviting a break up into your relationship. This rings especially true since only one person got it, so now he will be resenting you for not doing the same for him. Add to this the fact that you two are so young and haven't been together for very long, plus the fact that he is accusing you of not being as committed to him simply for having foresight of the future...this is honestly a recipe for disaster. In my opinion, if you were to get the tattoo, you would not only regret it and resent yourself for it, but it would also either be with you forever, or you'd have to pay a substantial amount ((plus the pain involved with the procedure)) to get it removed.\n\nEdit: Oh, plus it's a bad sign that he tried to pressure you into doing something you had already made clear you didn't want to do. Double points for that thing being permanent in most cases. I know I already mentioned that, but it resonates with this point, as well.", "not tha AH. I have tattoos. I have my daughters name on me. I do not have my partners name or initials on me. I wouldn't do that and we've been together 14 years.", "Personally, for me, him continuing to guilt and pressure me into permanently changing something about my body after I had explicitly said NO would be a dealbreaker. He is throwing up some bright red flags here. Keep your eyes wide open. NTA.", "NTA but \"said I just wasn\u2019t interested in having tattoos in general\" so his response is to...book you a tattoo appointment?  This is a red flag of potentially bigger issues - not respecting your choice, your bodily autonomy, trying to blame you for not doing what he wants, trying to guilt you into doing something you very clearly said you were not going to do.\n\nAt any age, that's a problem, but at 18/19, it's even more concerning.", "NTA. You told him the first time you discussed it that you weren\u2019t interested in getting a tattoo. He was hoping to manipulate you into getting it anyway by booking the appointment and getting his first. \n\nGood for you for standing your ground and not giving in to the guilt trip. All he\u2019s doing is proving himself too immature and manipulative to be worth having tattooed, imo. This relationship isn\u2019t going to last. \n\nAlso I don\u2019t know what your interactions at the shop were like, but most reputable artists would refuse to tattoo someone\u2019s initials on you unless they were 100% sure you wanted them. They\u2019re not interested in permanently altering anyone\u2019s body who\u2019s being coerced into having it done.
