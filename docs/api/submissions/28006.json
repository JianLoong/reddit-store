So I, 20m, and my best friend 20m, go to the same college.  Same degree, same department. Recently he got called in for an interview for what is essentially his dream internship. I was very happy for him, but that's when it all started to go downhill. After scheduling the interview, he pulled me aside (we live together) and asked me if I could do him a favor.\n\nHe needed three references for the interview and was struggling to find a third. He wanted to put me down as one and wanted to lie saying I used to be a professor of his. I told him that was a bad idea, as they would probably check this and he said he highly doubts they will. I told him no, and he seemed shocked and asked me why I wouldn't do it for him. He pointed out that he had done this for me in the past, but I countered by saying it was just some fast food job in the summer.\n\nThe reason why I was so nervous to do this for him is that the internship is involved with the graduate program we both want to attend, and I am scared that if I get caught impersonating a professor by the people in the department, I can kiss my chances of grad school and possibly even my undergrad degree goodbye. He said I was overreacting and being paranoid- I told him sorry but I wasn't comfortable doing it. He just said that was really disappointing and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nA week passes, and he says he killed it in the interviews and they loved him. I was happy for him. Then one day I was coming back from the gym and low and behold my phone rang. It's one of the people from the department- they wanted me to describe my experience with my \"previous student\" and describe what type of person he was. I was honestly caught really off-guard and said I think they may have the wrong number as I'm a student at the university and not a professor. The lady seemed very surprised and apologized before hanging up.\n\nWhen I got home I told my friend about it, asking why he would still put me down as a reference after saying I wasn't comfortable lying for him. When I told him what I said and how I reacted he just sat on the couch with his head in his hands and said he couldn't believe I wouldn't just say a couple sentences to cover for him. He didn't even get angry, he just seemed distraught. He didn't get the internship and now he won't really talk to me and it's been very awkward. I hate this.

You are right to be cautious as it pertains to your future also. Had they had found it to be you, then your potential future at that company or even similar companies in the same field. I don\u2019t know what your field is, but I personally would want to avoid future blackballing. Now remember you\u2019ve discussed this with your friend in depth so you aren\u2019t in the wrong in the slightest. He betrayed you and decided to use you anyway against your will. Could you have gone along with it since it was so far gone? Maybe. But that would be letting your friend think that what they did was ok and that it would have had zero consequences. That would be letting your friend cross clear boundaries. If anyone should feel awkward here, it\u2019s them for putting you in this position in the first place.", "NTA. You let you friend know your position when he first asked. To put you down anyways against your wishes was manipulative. He assumed when you got the call you\u2019d be forced to lie on the spot even though you were very clear that you were uncomfortable (which I support. I\u2019d be worried about the same things you were worried about.)\n\nHe put himself in this position but listing you. That\u2019s on him, not you.", "NTA.  This is called fraud, and it could have seriously impacted OP's academic standing, future career, and reputation within the department.  Further, the friend asked, got no for an answer, and proceeded to do it anyway.  While I get their dilema to an extent, friend was being a real AH here.  He's 20 and in school.  I bet if he said he was unsure of who the third reference could the company could have either made a suggestion or let it slide.", "NTA. What I find ironic is the entire point of putting down a reference is so someone can provide evidence of good character and integrity. So, really, the potential employers got the exact reference they needed to reflect their prospective intern.", "I am so sorry that this has happened. However, you are NTA. You did the right thing. It might be the end of this friendship, but lying for him could have made things worse for you in the future. That was a wise choice.", "NTA - He asked you, you said no and that should have been the end of the matter.", "NTA. It's not your fault that he didn't get his dream internship. First of all, he was going to lie to get there which is deceitful and wrong. Second, when he asked if he could put you down as a reference and you declined, he still put you down. How were you supposed to know he wasn't going to respect your request and put you down anyways? You're not wrong at all. When you got the call, you handled it perfectly with the wrong number thing because it wasn't outwardly accusatory (ie. you didn't say something like oh he lied about the reference). Your friend is the AH here for not respecting you and still putting you down as a reference. I'm so sorry this happened bro", "NTA - your friend did it all on his own by lying on the application and saying you were a professor. He shot his credibility with that.\n\nIt was one thing to ask at the beginning - you told him no, and why. He went ahead and did it anyway and has proven to the internship board that he is untrustworthy.", "You\u2019re NTA. Your friend is for trying to force you into lying for him.", "NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYou told him not to put you down and that you wouldn't lie for him.  He disregarded this.  This is 100% on him, and yes your concerns about messing up your own future as well were fully justified.  Even if it was comparable, which it's not, doing something in the past for a fast food job does not entitle him to expect you to put yourself in that kind of possible issue.", "NTA. Frankly, a brief Google search, unless you've got a common name, would expose the ruse. Most professors are Google-able, at least their professional pages and school affiliations. That's a really terrible idea. And then you've got a black mark next to your name with that organization.", "He betrayed your trust", "Nta you didn't do anything wrong, you have integrity.\n\nI work with college students seeking internships and know at least one situation where an offer was rescinded because they faked a reference.", "NTA. You told him clearly you were unwilling to go along with the lie. It could definitely have impacted your future. You did the right thing.", "NTA. Your friend lost himself the internship, by lying and committing fraud.  You told him no and he went behind your back and did it anyway.  He got what was coming to him.  He was willing to risk your academic future (if you had gone along with it.)  A true friend wouldn't put you in that position and would respect your decision.", "NTA He should never have asked. It's his own fault.\nDid he also have to provide them with work email address (that's usually required to stop exactly what he did occurring)\n\nWhy did he choose not to ask one of his previous professors?", "NTA  and screw him. He isn't a friend. He is a parasite. This is the kind of guy who will happily drag others down with him. You would be wise to steer clear of him.", "You didn't get him rejected from his dream internship. *He did that all on his ownsome*.\n\nHow can he have gone through two or three years of college and NOT have three references? What is he doing in class that only two of his professors were willing to be a reference? Why didn't he just offer you as a reference from a fellow student?\n\nAll your reasons for not doing this are valid. And moral!  Good for you!! \n\nHe was perfectly willing for you to be ground under a bus as soon as (not if!) they found out. That would get BOTH of you censured if not expelled! Think about that. This person is not acting like a friend.\n\nNTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

So your friend is upsetwith you because you wouldn't be dishonest for him yet he was completely ok with possibly ruining your future?\n\n  If you get caught lying you both would be in trouble but it would be worse for you, you would most likely get  kicked out of the university program and the university could take legal action for tarnishing their reputation. Plus, what university will accept a student that was kicked out for impersonating a professor? You know people talk and someone will post it on the internet, and it will get around.

I am considered overly cautious by many people, but the fact that I could get kicked out and have my entire life ruined just seemed like way too high of a price. like- i'm sorry, but you'll just have to figure it out on your own. Guess ik how that turned out though", "This is his personal phone number! If they saved it in their phone, they could easily realize that it belongs to a student and not a professor. Very dangerous business!!", "Also it\u2019s pretty easy to find most professors info in this day and age.
