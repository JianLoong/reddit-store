If your daughter is \u201cworking\u201d for the allowance then why not?? I can understand your DH not wanting to hand her \u20ac400 every month for nothing. Another proposition could be helping her get a car sooner than her having to save for it.

Why does she have to struggle just because other teenagers have parents that aren't as financially stable as you and your husband?\n\nAnother way to think about it is when you and your husband pass everything you own, including all financial assets, will pass to your daughter (I'm assuming you don't have other children) unless you plan to give it to charity or something. \n\nSince she's going to get it all anyway, and the $400 is something you can afford and wouldn't change your lifestyle, why not give some of it to her now when she needs it and can actually use it versus in 40 years when she's had a career and probably won't *need* it as much.", "As an American, there are two types of people in this world: those who struggled and don't want to see others struggle the same way and those that think it's unfair that they struggled and want others to do the same. Your relationship happens to be made up of both of those people. NTA, supporting your daughter through college is admirable.", "NAH  This seems like just a disagreement.  IMO, you are both right and a compromise solution seems appropriate.  You were not initially planning to just give her money, but to pay for something specific.  Since that isn't necessary, just giving her money doesn't seem right.  Give her an allowance, but a lesser amount that reflects the fact that you are essentially paying her rent by allowing her to live with you.", "My opinion; \nAllowances are for children to learn the importance of money and how to spend it to encourage them to buy their own things. Allowances are earned through chores, actions or good grades not given flat out.\n\nYour daughter? She's the adult and needs to be treated as such now she needs to get a part-time job.

Teaching her that she should be fairly compensated for her work and time is in no way \"spoiling\" her, and is a far better lesson and mindset with which to send her out into the world than your husband's plan to show her that \"reality\" is just people coldly taking as much as they can from you, so you might as well accept defeat before you even get started.\n\nNTA. Your husband is being rigid and stingy.", "NTA\n\nYou aren't spoiling your daughter you are merely just trying to help her buy a house by giving her a little money each week.

Maybe your husband would be more comfortable with this instead?", "NTA! I think this would be a great opportunity for her and she would appreciate it very much. It sounds like you guys (mom and daughter) have a good relationship and you talk very positive about her.

Could you compromise and make it a payment for the housework she does for you?

While yes, she could get a part time job, I\u2019d suggest against it. From my own personal experiences and my friends, working and going to school really sucks.

I have seen with my boyfriend how much help you can give if you can afford it, and it will be such an advantage. Maybe put half of it away to help save for a down payment for a house. Seriously, is she'd be able to buy a house earlier because of it, she will lose much less money by renting. \nWhy would you try to make it harder for her, the world makes it hard enough nowadays.", "YTA only for floating the idea with your daughter before discussing it with your husband. Now, if you decide against giving the allowance, he looks like the bad guy.\n\nThere's no clear right or wrong here. If she were a \"full\" adult, i.e. graduated from college, she would be expected to pay _you_ rent. As you were going to pay her rent to support her through college, if she lives at home, giving her no allowance would essentially be paying rent to yourselves. OTOH, her decision to stay at home benefits you since you get to keep an extra 400\u20ac, and maybe you also enjoy having her around. So some kind of compromise might make sense, like 200\u20ac.

This whole idea that people should work while in school is relatively new.  \n\nAnyway, working during college is only beneficial under certain circumstances and up to a certain extent.  Placing any sort of financial pressure on a college student to simply teach them a lesson is super unhelpful.  Students who have to work to cover their expenses during college are more likely to take fewer credits per semester, devote less time to studying, take longer to graduate, and are more likely to drop out.
