We knew that it wasn\u2019t legal, it was built too close to our boundary & they didn\u2019t have a permit.\n\nWe (husband 42M) built our house in 2011 and our neighbours in 2010. Over the 10+ years we have only had a few issues. \n\nWe\u2019re putting an extension (small retreat for my mother) on the boundary to Jeff & Jane. It is legal, we have a building permit & surveyors sited the setback. I advised Jane before commencing work what was happening. Jane had issues immediately as \u201cyou have all those flooding issues you keep telling us about\u201d(from something they did).\n\nAs work progressed Jane\u2019s made it difficult for our tradies. She called police when one smiled & waved at her, parks her car to restrict access & loves filming them working.\n\nJane is most peeved about privacy. There is a gap between my shrubs of 70cm where you can see over the 1.8m high fence, the gap has always been there. She installed shonky, illegal screening which is now removed following one of our daily \u201cchats\u201d. Jane has been ranting that we had no right to do the extension, they were owners first & built how they did for privacy. Note their other side is bush reserve but they built their patio & pool against our boundary.\n\nI\u2019ve told Jane if my mum needs more privacy I will put up blinds otherwise I can grow a vine, she said that would take too long to grow. Jane wants me to do something NOW as I\u2019m causing her more heart trouble. I told Jane she could add blinds to her gazebo but \u201cno, that would ruin the look\u201d. I asked \u201cwhy is it okay to ruin my look but not yours when it\u2019s you with the issue?\u201d It has been daily drama & abuse from Jane, I am close to breaking point.\n\nTwo days ago the utility trenches were dug out. The tradies didn\u2019t finish everything in one day so some dirt & grass was left on Jane\u2019s side. We had it all roped off with orange screening for safety & tradies would be back at 7am next day to finish.\n\nWell\u2026 Jane sauntered over in her usual death eater manner. I opened the door holding my baby & said \u201cI don\u2019t have it in me today Jane. I can\u2019t deal with whatever you have to say\u201d. She said \u201cI can\u2019t deal with any of this you are causing my heart issues to worsen. You need to move that dirt off our lawns NOW. I\u2019ve called council.\u201d I called to my husband to deal with her. He asked her what the problem was, said it would be gone tomorrow & look the same as before. Jane screeched \u201cyou should never have built that!\u201d I snapped that I would be chopping down ALL our shrubs that give her privacy & \u201cwe\u2019re planning a second storey extension NOW with a balcony overlooking your yard so goodluck with that\u201d.\n\nThat was yesterday, today I called council & confirmed gazebo is placed too close to our boundary & doesn\u2019t have a permit. If I email council they will investigate & have them either remove or relocate it. If they chose to relocate it will cost around $10,000 for a permit & work.\n\nWIBTA for reporting them?", "created_utc": 1692300800, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15tx8qi/wibta_for_reporting_my_neighbours_gazebo/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In this case you would be protecting your property from fire, water, and potential foundation damage.  \nIt doesn't appear that you can really make your relationship with your neighbor worse, so I likely would, especially since you indicated that you've had no luck working with her on the drainage issue.

Maybe I\u2019ll let him go and talk to her since I don\u2019t think I can do it without cracking again.", "Should probably add that council advised the gazebo is a fire hazard being so close to the boundary as it \u201ccan jump\u201d to our extension easier. I never realised that until I spoke to council (I didn\u2019t give the address, you can see all building permits online which is how I knew they didn\u2019t have one, we are bushfire prone with a bush reserve at the back that is back burned every few years). \n\nThe fire hazard wasn\u2019t there for us before an extension as it had nothing to \u201cjump to\u201d. That\u2019s the reason for a 1.5m setback so there is 3m of space between buildings. Now that I know this we need to look at if our insurance is affected by their illegal structure and what we can do to mitigate this risk. Reddit didn\u2019t give me enough space to type it all in and I chose to focus on the initial issues as that is what started it all.", "Flooding is seperate to gazebo. Gazebo is at back of property where extension is and flooding is at front of property. They concreted their entire front side yard sloping it down right up to our front boundary fence. This is also against building codes and we could have gone to council but we have been trying to work with them for years. \n\nIt has diverting all their run off from rain (we are coastal Australia and have a lot of rain) and their pool overflowing onto our property. So far it has washed out chunks of our garden beds, left holes in the front yard and before my husband put in extra drainage it left it swampy for weeks after wet weather. \n\nLast year it was always wet and we realised their pool pump was leaking. My husband fixed the leak for them (free of charge) so we would have less water on our land. He is worried about the damage to our house foundation. The extra stormwater drainage he put in has slowed down the damage to the yard but it hasn\u2019t stopped it. Once we finish the extension we are planning to concrete that section and put some larger pits in to handle both properties drainage. \n\nOn the many occasions we\u2019ve tried to talk with Jeff & Jane - Jeff says \u201ctalk to Jane, this was her idea\u201d and Jane says \u201cyour property your problem\u201d\u2026", "There is nothing to be gained from being nice to her at this point. Deal with both the gazebo and the drainage as they are both negatively impacting your property. You can\u2019t just lay down for a bully, and that\u2018s what she is.", "Don't listen to Reddit. \n\nReddit is insanely pro-revenge. To an unreasonable degree.", "Fingers crossed and don't be afraid to go in hard, people like that need boundaries. She's kinda trapped in her behavior right now, it's like Putin who can't back down without looking like a fool (granted she doesn't actually compare to him).", "You should outright call the council about the drainage issue as that is doing active damage to the property.  That isn't a revenge thing, that is preserving your property.  Don't even threaten her with that, just go ahead and call.  When she complains about that, tell her the Gazebo is next if she doesn't stop complaining.", "I think Jane is prime for a reevaluation of that opinion. It most certainly is not a you problem.", "NTA and you should have called about that drainage problem a LONG time ago. DO check with your house insurance- insurance companies will use any reason to raise rates or even not pay a claim. When she squalls like a mashed cat about how much the drainage and gazebo problems are going to cost her you should remind her that she said \"your property your problem\" so you are just taking care of \"your\" problems.", "Yes I agree about her being trapped in her behaviour. That\u2019s why I honestly thought this was my only move as she is escalating in anger and speeding up her time between confrontations. \n\nMy husband is generally the not so calm one and I\u2019m normally saying to him to just let it go. It\u2019s so weird having roles reversed here! He hasn\u2019t been dealing with Jane at all apart from that one discussion so maybe she will hear him more than me.", "If you do it this way, you also don't have to feel guilty if you end up making the official report because she essentially knew what she was getting into. \n\nWhy is he not stepping up more? You are clearly very stressed and it's not in your nature to be confrontational. A little healthy anger definitely doesn't hurt you, but it's better to team up.", "This is something we are doing for my mother so she can retire without financial stress so I\u2019ve tried to deal with as much as possible. \n\nHe is a great husband, he just knows that dealing with rude people is not his strength. I\u2019ve been dealing with Jane since 2011 and just can\u2019t anymore. I\u2019ve made that clear. He will step up and deal with Jane now.", "Agree about feeling guilty later, that\u2019s probably why I have written the email but not sent it and then posted here \ud83d\ude0a", "Ahahaha I feel you. I do self work with a concept called IFS (internal family systems) that assumes you have different parts inside of you. One of my parts is constantly angry, especially because he's often not allowed out. When he's mad he wants to go to war (his words not mine) and he gets so excited when he wins a fight, he's bursting with satisfaction and happiness \ud83d\ude02 of course other parts feel very opposite emotions and they produce guilt or shame around those topics", "That sounds just like my husband! Good on you for doing self work - my husband has been on a journey for his anger as well!", "Ahaha I am glad we are in it together. I honestly have more challenges with my people pleaser part and in reality am much more like you, but I am working on letting the anger part express itself more, because it's in there anyways, raging. I have a very hateful diary and already told some people that I don't want to be in touch with them anymore, not the kind of war he was hoping for but a win regardless. With Jane though he'd thrive threatening her with the investigation \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 let us know what happens and if she backs down!!!", "Ahah! Yes I am the people pleaser indeed and struggle with my no. I\u2019ll update the post after he chats with them later today."]}
