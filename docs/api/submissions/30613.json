I don't think she's satan and from the few times we've talked I feel like shes really understanding and reasonable. Hell maybe I can offer to make her one of her own. It'll be a painful process but I'm sure I can do it.", "OP, (with the exception of your ex) I think this is NAH between you and your son.\n\n1. I think his reasoning for wanting his gf to have the blanket you made is absolutely sweet! (I also wonder if she has something hard in her life, and that's why he *wants his gf to be surrounded by his mom's love - just as he has always been*.) That just melts my heart as a mom. And, your son is young enough not to have the vision of a long life and understand that this current gf will not likely be his life-time partner. Given that, I think you raised a really wonderful young man, who is in no way an AH.\n2. I want to also note that he shared with you his intentions BEFORE he actually gave gf the blanket. He is excited about his gift to her and feels that you are a part of it and wants to share that with you. He didn't just give it away on a whim and tell you as a passing after-thought. Again, a really wonderful young man.\n3. I also think it was good that you spoke up. The decision is your son's, and it is his mistake to make, BUT by speaking up you (1) gave him a chance to consider that long-term perspective he is too young right now to have on his own AND (2) you let him know that it means a lot to you for him to have it. Doing that is sooo much better than having said nothing, letting him give it away (and probably regret it later in life), and have a little wall of sadness exist between you two.\n\nI think you should tell him that you love how kind and generous he is. Ask him about his gf and whether she has a safe and loving family or is there a special reason he wants her to have your motherly comfort around her. Ask him also if he would like for you to add a few more inches to his blanket. (He can ship it to you to work on or just wait till he's visiting with you again.) Let him know that, while you love how caring he is, you also feel he will regret giving the blanket to someone at this early stage in his life... but that it's his decision and you love him always.", "NAH. you gifted it, he has fullcontrol of what to do with it.", "NTA, my best friends' mom knitted me a blanket once, which my ex also loved, and there is not a chance in hell I'd ever give it away. There's just so much love and effort that goes into selfmade gifts like such blankets, just casually giving it away is such a d*ck move. Your son is an AH for doing so and your ex should really talk some sense into him instead of supporting him.", "NTA - tell him to keep it to give to THEIR child because you won\u2019t be able to make one for your grandchildren.  \nThat way you aren\u2019t dismissing his relationship but keeping the blanket.", "I'm going to go against the grain here and say soft YTA because you gave the item to him as a gift. Once an item is gifted you cannot dictate how it is used or how the recipient values it. It is no longer your item, it is his. I made lots of things for family babies, including blankets, and have no idea what they did with them once they were gifted and the child was grown. The act of love was the making and the gifting. After that, the item, and the use of the item, is theirs.\nHe's given the blanket to someone important to him as an act of love, that's exactly what you did, so he's acted respectfully to the item. Embrace the fact he's done that, your son is what is important, not a blanket.", "YTA. I realize this is unpopular, and based on the headline I was ready to give the opposite. But you display a lot of victimization (no one made, asked, or expected you to hurt yourself to make a blanket this way, and he didn\u2019t ask you to make one at all). He\u2019s giving a treasured gift to a treasured person who can use it for its intended purpose. And it speaks volumes that you dismiss your son\u2019s relationship because you \u201cknow your son\u201d when he hasn\u2019t lived with you in the most recent two formative years of his life, when he met & started dating his gf.", "Maybe unpopular but, YTA the roll of a loving parent is to guide the boy, yeah maybe it take u ages to make but in the end is \"his\" blanket and this is not gona ruin his life nor any ones life, dont u think you should let him tke his own decisions over things he owns? he is an hormonal teenager and in some maner he is trying to do as he can to her partner he doesn't use, she likes it, and he decided to gift the blanket this is not as big as you think.\n\nEdit to point 2 other things i read on coments.\n\nYeah may they dont gona be forever, but who cares? in this moment he is happy and this is not a limit situation, yeah maybe u dont like it (cuz was hard to you) but gift a blanket isnt big deal, the love remains rigth.\n\nThis kind of behavior just make that a teenager hide things cuz you can't handle them.", "NTA- But at the same time when you gift someone something they have a right to do whatever they want with it, it is theirs. Keep that in mind next time you gift someone something because not everyone will value things the way you do. Your son is dumb and doesn\u2019t see the value, however he has a right to do what he wants with it.", "NTA", "Nta", "NTA. My sons have lost so many of their favorite sweatshirts that way.", "NTA, Thats a keepsake and he should get it back. Thats pretty crappy tbh", "NTA. While I do agree that he can do what he wants with his gifts\u2026this isn\u2019t an average \u201cbought at the store gift.\u201d I consider it in the same vein as giving away a family heirloom. Sure, great grandma gave me some earrings, but my mom wouldn\u2019t be wrong for being upset if I gave them away. \n\nThe blanket was made as part of the family, so it should stay in the family. It\u2019s the type of gift to pass down to your own children, not to a teenage relationship. Your son is kind, but he\u2019s not thinking ahead, and disregarding the blanket as \u201cjust a blanket,\u201d isn\u2019t respecting the time, effort, love, and familial symbolism of the blanket.", "NTA. I personally would see this blanket as a special personal gift that I would keep forever. You literally put years into and he is ready to give it away. It's a cute reason why, but still.", "NAH- OP, your son and ex view the blanket as a homemade craft project same as they would the toilet paper cover doll someone else might give you. You view it as a saga of love (inch for every inch he grew that year, caused me pain but I kept on) and that\u2019s a heavy burden for him to bear. He is in his first young love and his girl enjoys the blanket. She finds it comforting, it fills her with love from him. He shows love to her by enveloping her in it and giving it to her.\n\nSupport your son by letting go of this particular blanket and understanding he is extending that love to her with the gift.", "NAH. To be honest, your response (the whole \"that's fucked up of you to do\" thing) was not at all the best way to communicate your feelings on this. It's only going to make him defensive and/or dismissive of what you have to say.\n\nWhy don't you have a good talk with him about how much work you put into the blanket? Don't criticize his actions or downplay his relationship. Of course we know the chances of high school sweethearts lasting are low, but he's 18, he's probably not going to see it that way. Keep the discussion limited to your emotions - how happy you were every time you worked on that blanket, how much it means to you to know he has it with him when he's so far from you, how you can't help but be hurt to hear he's giving it away, etc. \n\nHe's an adult, though. Once you've said your peace, you have to understand he's free to do what he wants. It's possible he's making a mistake and will regret it later. It's possible he has a more utilitarian mindset than you and doesn't place as much value in the blanket; not everyone places emotional significance onto material things. In the end, that's his decision to make.", "I know it hurts, but honestly, you cannot govern, what the gift you gave away is being used for - including giving it away...\n\nWill they stay together? I don't  know, neither do you, but if it doesnt last and he regrets giving her the blanket, he will have learned a lesson from it...", "Because the maths say there is a 95+ % chance it they wont stay together. Even if they knock each other up and get married. \n\nIts a fucking fact that the chances are against them and thats no problem.", "Are you rural", "Relationships that start at 18 and last permanently a statistical outlier. A happy one for sure, but an outlier nevertheless. The difference between 18 and 25 is meaningful:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>According to a CDC.gov report, for marriages at the age of 18 years and younger, the probability of breaking up is 10% after one year of marriage. The likelihood of divorce increases to 29% for couples who stay married for more than five years.  \n>  \n>In comparison, 6% of spouses who marry at 20-25 years get divorced after one year of living as a family and 17% after five years.  \n>  \n>[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr049.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr049.pdf)", "That's good for you, but unfortunately, not even double the amount of the people you know cover the majority of all the combined teenage relationships in the US alone. It's just a matter of statistics rather than \"feelings\" at this point.", "If the girl knows you made it and it\u2019s significance and is still asking for it, then no, she\u2019s not innocent. 18 is not too young to have emotional intelligence. If I were you, i would just ask for the blanket back and keep it with myself if the son doesn\u2019t change his mind after you explain to him how much it means to you. And maybe tell him you\u2019ll give it to his wife or kid. \n\nYour ex is just an AH.", "Nta\n\nHow about you invite your son and teach him basic crocheting and then make him crochet something on a beginner level just so he gets a bit of a feeling for how much time and effort you put into his blanket? Like knitting your first scarf, it takes hours and will still come out shitty and uneven and smaller than you were expecting :D my guess is that he literally lacks an understanding just how much work went into that blanket.\n\nAlso you could suggest you can crochet it longer to fit him again. From a functional pov it doesn't have much use to him if it's to short to use. \n\n\nPersonal opinion: If I were in your shoes I'd try to kindly, but firmly veto his move. You don't have hard authority of course but this is a soft power matter. This is one of those things where it is ok to be firm in the right way. I'd explain to him that this is important to you and you *would* feel both disappointed and hurt by this move even if he honestly didn't intend it at all. That you want to expect him to keep the blanket in his own possession and not give it away. His choice will have a lasting impact on your relationship either way and he should reflect on that before making his decision.", "Yeah but here's the thing, just because its smaller, he doesn't need to give it away. He could use it as a trow over foot of the bed, a throw over a chair. Sofa blankie for winter time. It doesn't need to fully cover him. He will regret giving it away one day.\n\nLastly, boys just arent as sentimental as girls are. Very few would really treasure things like this. I know my husband for one, hes too daft when it comes to these sort of nuances. Its infuriating most of the time. \n\nIts also i guess different culture, in europe we really cherish gifts given especially ones hand made. Even if its a hideous monstrosity you got from grandma, you fold it neatly, and you think of her when you look at it once in a while. \n\nIts vastly different when youre a teenager vs adult and you know your time with loved ones is limited.", "OP you are NTA but the father is. I would be super upset if I was in your shoes.  It is not just a blanket! You have put time and effort and love making that blanket for your son. He is young and ignorant and doesn't realize how much sentimental value that blanket has. I started teaching myself how to crochet at the beginning of this year. I've made 2 blankets and I legit just started on my third yesterday.  This one I'm working on is for my only child, my 24yo son. I know my son will love it and cherish it (not trying to make you feel worse, I'm sorry). The reason why I say this is because he's the one that encouraged me to crochet.  We make an effort to hang out at least once a month and have a mom and son weekend.  I mentioned I wanted to learn how to crochet  while out shopping.  He made me buy the tools I needed and told me to get started and when I get the hang of it I better make him a blanket. I would be devastated if he were to give the blanket I made especially for him to someone else. My heart goes out to you.", "I definitely am not the person now at almost 25 that i was at 18. The person I am with is so different from the crushes i had at 18, and so much better. Maybe there\u2019s a few cases where people find their forever in high school sweethearts but most people change a LOT in the early 20s. \n\nIt\u2019s too early for the OP\u2019s son to give away something her mother\u2019s been working on over the period of his entire life.", "But.. but but the anecdotal exceptions!", "You can also ask her the colours she likes and tailor it more to her tastes or do a smaller project for her like a matching scarf and hat.", "Do not make her a blanket. Instead, offer to extend his or have someone do it for you."]}
