That's just facts.  This is something he might want to give to his own child one day, and he might regret giving it to her.  What if it ends badly and she doesn't want to give the blanket back?", "Not to drive the knife in, but this is where a father or any older male figure should step in and tell him he\u2019s being fool.", "No, your ex is the AH, hes instilling some strange notion into your son. For one your ex should never call you names. And second, i dont understand why your son would want to give away something his own mom gave him. Its really odd. \n\nEven more so i wonder if the girl even knows the significance of it. \n\nHes also 16, so he is dumb. This gift might've been best to keep till he was much, much older and would've actually cherished it.", "NTA", "I've done something similar with a beloved item that was a gift from my grandparent, when I was your son's age. I regret it to this day. This post made me so sad.\nNTA. Hope he comes to his senses soon.", "NTA, Your son is absolutely the asshole, i wish i had something like that. You should only give something like that to someone you are going to spend your life with not the average gf. A Typical 18 year old choice was made there.", "NTA\n\n> I told him that I thought it was kind of fucked up that he would give away something I worked so hard on for him and that it really wasn't the type of thing you give to a highschool girlfriend.\n\nIs spot on. Tell him to ship it back to you and you'll save it for his child.", "NAH. It\u2018s sweet how he cherishes his girlfriend - seems like you raised a lovely, caring person there. \n\nBut you are probably right, they are not going to be forever and it would be sad if he lost that special blanket. I hope he comes to his senses - or if they separate, she is kind enough to give it back to him.", "Nta - I'm going to be honest I did not read the story. But what are the chances something you made is for your son is going to end up your sons partners after they break up.\n\nI'm not saying they will break up. But what are the chances", "NTA", "NTA but at the end of the day it\u2019s his choice to make. He\u2019s an adult and it was a gift; you can\u2019t police what someone does with a gift once you give it to them.. that\u2019s just the way it is. \n\nI am sorry though, because I know how much I want my children to cherish the things I\u2019ve given them and I know it must hurt. \n\nBut you\u2019re going to have to let this one go.. it\u2019s his blanket and he gets to choose what he does with it. Sorry.", "NTA, but you probably can\u2019t do much to change the situation without being viewed as the AH. Let your son make his mistakes, his gf will get the blanket, maybe they stay together, maybe they don\u2019t - maybe she\u2019s good and gives it back and something he once loved will then be bittersweet, maybe she doesn\u2019t and he will be remorseful for a long time - but that\u2019s his potential mistake to make, his thing to be sad about (if it comes to that), and his thing to (hopefully) come to you with and say \u201cI get it now, that was dumb\u201d", "Eh Nta but he feels differently about the blanket than you do. It\u2019s quite possible if they break up she will give it back.", "NTA I swear stuff like this makes me feel like it's dumb to ever go very far out of your way to do anything special for anyone.  There is no guarantee that they will appreciate it.  Sorry OP, I know you put your heart and soul into that blanket.", "NAH  you cannot expect him to put the same value on things as you do.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He will regret that later in life", "Have him send the blanket back to you in the mail and you can add some length onto the blanket.", "It\u2019s not \u201cjust a blanket\u201d it\u2019s a future family heirloom and if it\u2019s his wish to give it to his girlfriend, it should go to her the day they get married with the understanding it goes to their children once they are born.", "Why do so many people say that. I\u2019m in my 40\u2019s and most of the couples I know got together before 25, many before 20.  Obviously not every relationship works out but people don\u2019t need to be 25+ to find love.", "Unfortunately his only older male figure is his Father and clearly he sees nothing wrong with the situation since as he said it's just a blanket.", "I do know that she knows I made it. But them being as young as they are I don't think either of them truly realizes the significance. \n\nHe loves the blanket and used it all the time but now that he's taller it doesn't cover him the same way and I think in his own way he doesn't want it to become useless so by giving it to his girlfriend who likes it and is a foot shorter than him the blanket can still be used and cherished. \n\nMy ex is an ex for a reason and he had a very different relationship with his mom than I have with my son. His mom was an alcoholic and abusive so I believe he just doesn't understand what a healthy mother-son relationship looks like.", "Thank you I did my best to raise him to have an open mind and caring heart. \n\nI really don't think she's the type of person to be vindictive or malicious but I haven't spent enough time speaking to or even around her to know for sure.\n\nI've seen enough people go from sweet to crazy AF to know they don't always show that side of themselves until a breakup.", "He just turned 18 so that's an adjustment I'm just now having to deal with for the first time. Not that I policed a lot of things, I didn't really need to. \n\nBut you are correct he's an adult he can and will be making his own decisions and I just have to deal with the ones I don't like.\n\nThank you for that unwanted but honestly needed reality check.", "There's a huge difference between 18 and 25.  People can change so much in those years.  Your brain isn't even fully developed until you're 25.  \n\nUnfortunately, your experience isn't supported by the statistics.", "Maybe show him the post or at least explain yourself carefully and in more depth to him about how you\u2019d like him to get it back and hold onto it and find it important. He\u2019s 18. She probably just told him how much she likes it and he white knight offered it to her spur of the moment without either realizing the significance. If he\u2019s willing, help him find a tactful way to ask her for it back, and perhaps make it up to her with some other gift. If she isn\u2019t satan she\u2019ll play ball and not hate you or him. If that doesn\u2019t work, that sucks and I\u2019m sorry.", "I\u2019m pushing 40 and married to my University sweetheart who I\u2019ve been with since I was 19 and he was 18. \n\nRegardless, the odds of any random set of teenage lovers going on to spend their lives together is low, that\u2019s just reality.", "Thanks I'll try that now that I'm calmer. I don't think she's satan and from the few times we've talked I feel like shes really understanding and reasonable. Hell maybe I can offer to make her one of her own. It'll be a painful process but I'm sure I can do it."]}
