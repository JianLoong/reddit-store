My parents passed away a few months ago, and I inherited their house. So I am 35F, and my sibling is 32M. We haven't spoken in years due to some past issues, and we've never had a great relationship.\n\nAfter my parents' passing, I decided to sell the house. It needed a lot of repairs and maintenance, and I didn't want to deal with it. I found a buyer and sold the house for a good price. However, I never told my sibling about the sale, nor did I offer to split the proceeds with them.\n\nTo give some background, my relationship with my sibling has been strained for a long time. We grew up together, but we were never close. We had different interests and personalities, and we often fought and argued. As we got older, things only got worse. We had some major conflicts that led to us cutting off contact completely.\n\nWhen my parents passed away, I was the one who took care of everything. I planned the funeral, dealt with the paperwork, and sorted out their finances. It was a difficult and emotional time for me, but I felt like I had to step up and take charge. My sibling didn't offer to help or contribute in any way.\n\nSo, when I decided to sell the house, I didn't feel like I needed to involve my sibling. They hadn't been in touch with my parents for years, and they hadn't shown any interest in the house or their belongings. I assumed they wouldn't care what happened to it.\n\nRecently, my sibling found out about the sale and is furious with me. They're saying that I had no right to sell the house without their knowledge or consent, and that I'm being greedy by keeping all the money for myself. They're demanding that I split the proceeds with them, even though they never contributed anything to the house or helped with the repairs.\n\nI feel like I had every right to sell the house since it was legally mine, and I didn't want to involve my sibling because of our past issues. However, I can see how they might feel hurt and left out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not telling my sibling about the sale and keeping all the money for myself? Or am I within my rights as the legal owner of the house? I'm really struggling with this and I could use some objective opinions.", "created_utc": 1683282733, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138hm8o/aita_for_selling_my_deceased_parents_house/", "score": 3518, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

By not informing my sibling about the sale and not offering to split the proceeds, I might be seen as acting selfishly and disrespecting my sibling's rights as a beneficiary.

Well, they could have still loved him and wanted him to have something despite being estranged, but there is another possible reason as well. There is a trick estate lawyers will use when helping clients draw up a will they think might be contested by a relative they might not otherwise want to leave anything to. They will leave that relative a sum just large enough to be valuable to the relative, and then they will put a clause in the will saying that anyone who contests the will gets their bequest voided if the will is upheld.

I think this is great actually, bc it prevents deadbeat parents from leaving those they chose to bring into this world with nothing. \n\nas I said, you can leave nothing to your child (and if you have reason, I have nothing to say), but I wonder what kind of people would do that and only the worst kind comes to my mind.", "But someone who went through the process of settling an estate and selling a house that came out of the estate, **like the OP**, WOULD become aware of these laws, as part of the process.", "You can think whatever you want, but all of the comments suggesting OP might not really be the sole heir to the house rely on suppositions of the least likely scenarios and most of them operated in complete ignorance of how estate law or real property transfers work.\n\nOP says she is the sole heir to the house.\n\nThe information that the brother was estranged from not just her, but the parents as well, provides a reasonable explanation of why the parents would leave the house to just her.\n\nOP says she legally owns the house. The fact that she was able to conduct a real estate transaction and transfer title of the house to the buyer supports this. She had to either have sole title to the house, or sole power of attorney over the estate as executor to be able to do this without the brother being involved. \n\nYes, the latter does leave a small possibility for selling something she hadn't legally inherited. But seriously considering that small possibility requires making several assumptions of bad faith about the OP. It would require assuming she was knowingly lying to us when she said she \"inherited\" the house, that it was \"legally mine\", and that she was \"*the* legal owner\" (emphasis mine), because an executor who had gone through the process of selling a house by using their power of attorney would know the difference between inheriting something and it being legally hers, vs executing power of attorney over it. It would also require making the bad faith assumption that she willfully committed a serious breach of her fiduciary duty as the executor of her parents' estate, something she could go to jail for in some jurisdictions.\n\nNow, it's not unheard of for people to deliberately omit critical information or outright lie on this sub to garner sympathy, but it is not reasonable to assume someone is doing this unless there are significant inconsistencies in their narrative to indicate they are not telling the whole truth. There are no such inconsistencies in the OP's story. The brother objecting to the sale and saying she had no right to sell it without his consent, and that he should get half of the money, this is not evidence that casts doubt on OP's story because it is so common for disgruntled relatives who were left out of wills to make these kinds of emotional claims against the relatives who did benefit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: believe that OPs are telling us the truth unless they give us reason to believe they are not.

Assuming the OP is telling the whole truth and nothing but the truth is the least likely scenario because a) people generally don't tell the objective truth in disputes (OP is biased) and there ARE weird inconsistencies and gaps in what they said, almost to the degree of paradox. Others have pointed these out. The OP has said their brother is legally entitled to their share of the money. Did you miss that bit? The OP has not given any reason or explanation why their brother would not be entitled.\n\nI don't know what possessed you to write so much in support of a supposition you know little to nothing about: one side of a story that's extremely inconsistent.\n\n>believe that OPs are telling us the truth unless they give us reason to believe they are not.\n\nFirstly they have as explained above but even if they hadn't, it is very common for people to seek reassurances here and they're not going to get them if they ATA and they tell the truth.
