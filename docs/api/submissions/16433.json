My parents passed away a few months ago, and I inherited their house. So I am 35F, and my sibling is 32M. We haven't spoken in years due to some past issues, and we've never had a great relationship.\n\nAfter my parents' passing, I decided to sell the house. It needed a lot of repairs and maintenance, and I didn't want to deal with it. I found a buyer and sold the house for a good price. However, I never told my sibling about the sale, nor did I offer to split the proceeds with them.\n\nTo give some background, my relationship with my sibling has been strained for a long time. We grew up together, but we were never close. We had different interests and personalities, and we often fought and argued. As we got older, things only got worse. We had some major conflicts that led to us cutting off contact completely.\n\nWhen my parents passed away, I was the one who took care of everything. I planned the funeral, dealt with the paperwork, and sorted out their finances. It was a difficult and emotional time for me, but I felt like I had to step up and take charge. My sibling didn't offer to help or contribute in any way.\n\nSo, when I decided to sell the house, I didn't feel like I needed to involve my sibling. They hadn't been in touch with my parents for years, and they hadn't shown any interest in the house or their belongings. I assumed they wouldn't care what happened to it.\n\nRecently, my sibling found out about the sale and is furious with me. They're saying that I had no right to sell the house without their knowledge or consent, and that I'm being greedy by keeping all the money for myself. They're demanding that I split the proceeds with them, even though they never contributed anything to the house or helped with the repairs.\n\nI feel like I had every right to sell the house since it was legally mine, and I didn't want to involve my sibling because of our past issues. However, I can see how they might feel hurt and left out.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for not telling my sibling about the sale and keeping all the money for myself? Or am I within my rights as the legal owner of the house? I'm really struggling with this and I could use some objective opinions.", "created_utc": 1683282733, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138hm8o/aita_for_selling_my_deceased_parents_house/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I might be seen as the asshole in this situation because my sibling is technically entitled to a share of the inheritance, even though we have a strained relationship. By not informing my sibling about the sale and not offering to split the proceeds, I might be seen as acting selfishly and disrespecting my sibling's rights as a beneficiary. Even though my sibling didn't offer any help or support during the process, they may still feel hurt and betrayed by my actions.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
