We are having our ceremony 3 weeks before the reception so we can have a very small private ceremony with only immediate family and the bridal party, then a big celebration with friends and extended family without having to cram it into one day.\n\nLast week we visited my family and my grandparents were there(81f/89m). She had not seen my ring in person yet and once she did she began sobbing. I\u2019m talking about wailing, screaming, tears and snot running down her face, and she needed to sit down because she was shaking and couldn\u2019t breathe. This went on for 4 minutes and my entire family was uncomfortable.\n\nOnce she had collected herself the day continued. We ate, watched tv, and talked. My mom asked if I needed any help with invitations, to which my grandma asked if we had set a date. I told her yes, (date 1) and the reception was (date 2). She asked about the ceremony and I gently told her that she was invited to the reception but the ceremony was going to be much smaller and she would not be attending that part. She immediately burst into tears again and started accusing me of hating her and \u201cruining\u201d MY wedding for HER. \n\nI explained that if we had invited her, we would have to invite ALL of the grandparents, 6 on my side, 5 on my fianc\u00e9s. She had the audacity to say \u201cnone of them need to be invited, but I should be there.\u201d I told her that was unfair, that it was my decision, and they would be at the reception but my grandmother was not having it. She was screaming and crying again, and threw her phone across the room. I snapped and told her that this outburst only solidified the decision to NOT have her at the ceremony because if she acted out like this or broke down like when she saw my ring, it would make the whole day a nightmare. She lashed out back at me saying she might be dead before she could go to the reception so she should be at the wedding. Everyone got quiet. I reminded her that the dates were less than a month apart, and she continued screaming and crying for 10 more minutes before she settled down and we left. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I stuck to our decision that we would be more than happy to have them at the reception, but the ceremony was private and had already made our final headcount of the guests there. My grandmother and mom think I\u2019m the AH, but the rest of my family agreed that it\u2019s OUR day and we can do things how we see fit. \n\nSo reddit, AITA for not having my grandmother at my wedding ceremony?", "created_utc": 1682151069, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12uz6jb/aita_for_not_inviting_my_grandmother_to_my/", "score": 86, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At 80+ years old, she shouldn't still be acting like a spoiled child.", "I wonder if they can do a live stream so others can at least watch.

Grandparents, aunts/uncles, nieces and nephews are NOT immediate family.", "Laura screwed a co-worker because OP isn't inviting her Granny to her wedding? Dude, that is messed up.", "I agree", "I would go one step farther and casually mention that you will have security at the event in case grandma decides to show up on her own.  Cause I could see your mom promising to everyone you enlist that she won't bring her, and STILL bringing her, or arranging for her to be brought, unless she knows grandma will get the boot.", "*What the hell* was the massive meltdown to the ring about??? She thinks it sucks? She thinks it's beautiful?\n\nIt sounds as though she should be on medication for a mental condition (and I say this as a person who is on medication for a mental condition).\n\nNo wonder you don't want to deal with this at your ceremony. You would be NTA for not wanting to deal with this at your reception. I hope you've made arrangements for a security team to escort out anyone who has this sort of meltdown.", "Immediate family is limited to the spouse, parents, stepparents, foster parents, father-in-law, mother-in-law, children, stepchildren, foster children, sons-in-law, daughters-in-law, grandparents, grandchildren, brothers, sisters, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, and first cousins.     https://www.law.cornell.edu/definitions/index", "Is your grandma actually a toddler, and you're just having us on?

Crazy selfish relatives.", "NTA", "NTA.  How did Gramzilla behave at your mother's wedding?\n\nNO ONE wants to watch Gma have an emotional meltdown in public.  Not only would it pull the focus off your happy events, it would cast a pall over the event and all your memories afterwards.\n\nLast thought, sometimes as people age their impulse control decreases. Is she inappropriate in other ways?  My 80 yo mother was always *the nicest* person I ever met; I always wished I was more like her.  Now after COVID and a Hurricane that destroyed her home, she just lets her mouth go into overdrive.  She always had unpleasant thoughts and opinions, she just did not voice them.  Now my Aunt and I are often telling Mom to \"tone it down\" or even \"stop being rude.\"  It happens.  \n\nOn a funny note, I have always been very direct, even blunt.  It serves me well now.  If my mom asks me for anything that I cannot do, I absolutely have to say \"No.\"  Otherwise, she interprets anything I say as a yes.  This drives my husband wild.  Yet she has shown up at my house on an evening to go to dinner when I had replied \"That night isn't really convenient for us.\"  Life is weird.", "NTA. Your wedding, your choice, But, I cannot imagine a case where my grandparents would not have made the cut as immediate family.", "NTA\n\nIs this normal behavior for her to react this way? I agree it\u2019s a way out there to react that way. Your grandma is at an age where she can develop dementia or have an infection that causes dementia like symptoms in her. If this is her normal, wow. If this is unusual for her, it might be a good idea to take her to the doctor.", "Just sounds like a control freak bridezilla. Yes, you are a major AH. Hope your wedding sucks", "Not everyone has your funds to invite every immediate family member. Ask for Op's account details and help her with some money so she can invite everyone else. \n\nThank you in advance", "LMAO \n\nAt a certain point they think they can get away with anything due to their age.", "There is something wrong with Grandma. Neurological workup might be in order. And, she\u2019s feeling her mortality and that\u2019s not a good feeling.", "NTA  - as a side note, if this behavior is unusual for her, your family may want to check in on her health. The onset of dementia reveals itself in strange ways.", "This was my first thought. Does grandma have something going on? \n\nOps NTA. It's gracious to still have her at the reception when this is how she's acting (with or without a mental condition. Even *if* she had an issue that makes this not a controllable behavior for her it's fair to not want her in an environment that could cause everyone including her stress)", "It sounds like a narcissistic outburst. \n\nIf it was a genuine meltdown for unknown reasons, I think OP and family would have reacted differently. \n\nIt sounds like this is not out of character for Grandma."]}
