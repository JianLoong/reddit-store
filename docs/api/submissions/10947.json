She FaceTimed me and asked me to be a bridesmaid in her wedding. Yay!!! I was so honored and said yes. I knew this question was coming and had already told her my husband and I were planning to bring our whole family (we have 2 young kids) in a road trip across the country so we can see old friends from when we lived in this state. At the end of the FaceTime she informed me that this was a no kids allowed wedding so could I find a babysitter. I was super thrown off by this and just said sure! Upon further thought though, this will be nearly impossible. I have a breast feeding baby. The wedding venue is close to 1.5 hours away from where our old friends live that would be willing to babysit and I don\u2019t feel comfortable having a stranger watch my kids. They are so young they don\u2019t speak yet and I have never hired anyone to babysit before. My husband offered to get an Airbnb (we were going to stay with friends for free) and stay there with the kids instead of going to the wedding and bring my breast fed daughter to me frequently throughout the day to nurse her. If you\u2019ve been in a wedding you know it is like a 10 hour commitment between getting ready and the actual event ending. This is lame and I don\u2019t want to drive all the way across America for my husband to not even attend the wedding with me and just sit in a hotel room all day. So if we go I could basically only show up for the ceremony and then leave which is a lot of work to get there to only stay for 30 min. So now I guess I call my friend back and tell her I can\u2019t actually be her bridesmaid or attend her wedding because my babies aren\u2019t welcome.

Instead, have a conversation with her, where you let her know where you're coming from and what, and what you'd need to be able to do this, and tell her you understand if that's not something she can't accommodate. You can still find a sitter for the one kid, right? Weddings *can* be a 10 hour ordeal, but not *all* weddings are that long. Ask her, and work with her.", "NTA. But my wedding wasn't even 10 hours.

If it was me, I would have mentioned the no kid rule before even asking you if it was ok for you to still be in my wedding and if you couldn't then I would just ask someone else.

It\u2019s just not always feasible to work around young kids. And being a bridesmaid can be a huge commitment. Even if it wasn\u2019t a child free event, do you really want to juggle being a bridesmaid, tending to your breastfeeding baby in public*, and trying to have a good time yourself?  (*I have nothing wrong with public breastfeeding. It\u2019s just a lot - strange place for baby, you aren\u2019t comfortable, you\u2019re wrestling with clothing and positioning\u2026)\n\nI was a bridesmaid for a good friend when my daughter was 4 weeks old and still breastfeeding. They allowed me to bring my daughter. We had a close friend who was able to sit with her so we could both stand up (me and husband were both in wedding party).  She went with us to the reception.  Sounds fine in your head, until you put it in practice. I\u2019m not saying this can\u2019t be done, and you can still have fun, but, it\u2019s a lot of time management, unpredictable baby, loud reception, wrangling with my bridesmaid dress, disappearing for chunks of time to breastfeed\u2026..I\u2019m exhausted just thinking about it.", "NAH. But don\u2019t say \u201cbecause my babies aren\u2019t welcome.\u201d Just say that you\u2019ve thought about it and it\u2019s going to be too hard to coordinate with young kids, breastfeeding, the distance etc and you are super excited to mark this milestone with her some other way.", "Unpopular opinion but YTA if you outright cancel without at least trying to make it work, since you already told her you would. 6 months is a long time for a baby, will they be weaned or eating some solids by then? And your older child will be further along developmentally as well. Talk to your friend: are there childcare options? What are the other parents doing? Can your husband come for part of the reception so he can eat with you and stay with the kids otherwise? Hotel nearby so you can have a dayroom for pumping and kids naps?", "NTA but sounds like your friend isn\u2019t important enough for you to attend and that\u2019s just fine", "Good point. I will tell her this weekend.", "Shouldn\u2019t it be NAH then?", "It\u2019s in 6 months so yes, it wasn\u2019t short notice! Although I will still be breast feeding (assuming nothing strange happens to make me stop earlier than I plan) and even that far in the future, I\u2019m not seeing that our childcare options will really change before then from being my husband in a hotel room all day, or hiring a stranger to stay in the hotel all day with them since we are not local, which I\u2019m just not comfortable with since my babies will still be very young in 6 months and the nursing one will need to be brought to me several times in the day, you know?", "Most weddings that have that rule are because they are providing alcohol and throwing a big party that kids should not be attending. The Bride makes that rule for a reason because it's the wedding they want to have and they have every right to make that choice.", "I love me a shorter event! Haha that\u2019s great. I\u2019m just going off of other weddings I\u2019ve been a bridesmaid in where you arrive around 9-10am for hair, makeup, then photos, the event begins at 1 or 2, then you dance some jigs into the night. My my wedding myself was also super short because I wanted it that way.", "I kinda felt that way honestly \ud83d\ude2c", "I have 6 months so it isn\u2019t super short notice. But what makes childcare hard is we are coming from out of state with no family near this wedding so it isn\u2019t as easy as dropping them off at grandmas like it would be if it was local, you know?", "That\u2019s ridiculous. The OP has zero obligation to attend a child free / baby free wedding when she has a nursing baby. People can have their weddings however they want but that doesn\u2019t obligare other people to attend.", "Right, and that context gives clues as to how the bride might figure out a way to accommodate OP.\n\nIt's up to the bride, but it's very possible the bride doesn't want kids there because of the amount of free flowing alcohol, but one or two infants being watched by sober adults is acceptable.", "Ya I didn't want a big extravaganza. The marriage is more important than the wedding and we saved that extra money for our 3 week road trip honeymoon and it was SO worth it. I never understood why having a big all day party like that is worth it. Plus most people who spend that much on their weddings end up divorced. Crazy how that works.", "Hi, I teach infants. Not sure if she was tricking you. A lot of people do not know the struggle of breast feeding. Being a new mom.", "I fully understand that, I just don\u2019t know if there\u2019s planning that could be done I.e freezing milk for a sitter.\n\nObviously you\u2019re NTA at all, your kids come first, but there might be a compromise if you\u2019re feeling bad.", "Only sober adults who aren't around the alcohol being consumed. Children should not be allowed in that environment. In other words, the kids need to be with a baby sitter, family, or friend that is not in attendance at the wedding. But the Bride doesn't have to make those accommodations because she isn't raising all of those kids. The Bride has way more things to worry about when planning a wedding.", "Yes we did the same and had my dream honeymoon! Definitely no regrets \u263a\ufe0f", "I could definitely consider my options longer before just jumping to it and telling her I can\u2019t come.(without taking too long of course to notify her.) Maybe there\u2019s an option I haven\u2019t considered.", "I agree with what you guys are saying. Definitely don\u2019t want my babies in that environment, although that isn\u2019t the case here as it is a very strongly religious community and alcohol will not be present at wedding, just to relate it back to my post \ud83d\ude0a", ">\tOnly sober adults who aren\u2019t around the alcohol being consumed. Children should not be allowed in that environment.\n\nComing from a country where childfree weddings (or other family events) are extremely rare this sound really weird. Why shouldn\u2019t kids be allowed \u201ein that environment\u201c?", "You aren\u2019t going to enjoy a wedding that requires you to pump and freeze your milk and hope your baby accepts the bottle and worry the whole time you are there. Your friend wants a baby free wedding and you have a nursing baby and that means she doesn\u2019t get to have you as a bridesmaid or guest.", "I know it would be an inconvenience on your part, but sometimes that can be worth it to make those you care about happy.\n\nJust don\u2019t strain yourself if it\u2019s too much, just a thought\u2026", "Either way it's the Bride and Grooms decision because it's their wedding and they can have the wedding they want. But hopefully she understands and will just find someone else to be in her wedding party.", "Because adults who are intoxicated are not safe around children. My mom's boyfriend is an angry drunk and I have been around him drunk multiple times and I would not want a child if mine around him when intoxicated.", "This is true. Besides, even if I do pump and freeze ahead of time, I will still need to pump several times at the event itself or I will likely become engorged and leaky, and who wants to fine a private room to slip away to pump while attending a wedding? \ud83d\ude02", "Then the problem is your mom\u2019s boyfriend. Not children at a wedding. I\u2019m in my mid-fourties and wouldn\u2019t want to be around an angry drunk at a wedding.\n\nThe solution here is not to exclude kids from family events but to exclude assholes.", "NAH\n\nAs of right now at the very least. This is an invitation, to both the wedding and be a bridesmaid. You are well within your rights to pull out, especially for this reason. If your friend pitches a fit or offers **any** resistance they are an asshole.", "NTA", "\nIt is an invite, not a summons. With 6 months left, that is more than enough time for the bride to find a new bridesmaid.", "If you'd still like to do the trip and have a holiday and catch up, maybe all of you could go to a rehearsal dinner or day after brunch.\n\nMaybe there's a non 10 hour swollen breast event you could attend to celebrate her wedding?\n\nNAH, if you tell her soon, and why, and if she doesn't try to insist.  Paint her a picture of you slowly throughout the day breaking the seams of your bridesmaid's dress then when the DJ plays something with a siren, twin fountains of milk erupting as you react to something like a baby's cry. \n\nI'm sorry, I'm taking that too far but the mental picture is hilarious to me.", "Haha thank you for making me laugh \ud83d\ude02 You\u2019re right, I hadn\u2019t even considered that the bridesmaid dress is likely not nursing bra/pad compatible \ud83d\ude02", "Sorry, but have you even been around people who are drunk before? My mom's boyfriend is just 1 of many who I would not want around kids when intoxicated.", "Yes. Literally dozens of weddings, large birthday parties with the whole family, friends etc. and lots of other occasions.\n\nNot one of them without kids, not one of them without alcohol.\n\nCan\u2019t remember any issues. If there are many persons in your life you can\u2019t trust to only drink in moderation during a family event (or any other time) that\u2019s still not the kids\u2018 problem.", "So all the parent's drive their kids home while intoxicated risking the lives of them, their kids, and even other people? Ya, that's not ok."]}
