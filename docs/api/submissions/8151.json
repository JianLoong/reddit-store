{"id": 8151, "submission_id": "10k2o2n", "title": "AITA for cancelling my holiday when my dogsitter ex books a holiday the same time?", "selftext": "So my ex and I are still very good friends. Have dinner together multiple times a week and he regularly sees my adult son who he essentially helped me bring up for most of his life. (For extra info, we broke up almost a decade ago and we are in a purely platonic relationship).\n\nWhenever I go on holiday, my ex will share dog-sitting duties with my son. They both work full time, and they both can choose to work from home for a day or two during the week so dog-sitting between them always works. My dog has certain medical conditions so I don\u2019t feel comfortable putting him into boarding or staying with my parents who are not \u2018dog people\u2019. \n\nAnyway, I asked my ex about 5 months ago if he would be available to co-watch my dog for a week in March. He said yes. \n\nHe told me yesterday that his friends asked him to go on holiday the same time as me and that he\u2019s going. He\u2019s booked his flights and accommodation. \n\nI was upset, but I didn\u2019t make a huge deal out of it, there was no point as he\u2019d booked it, and he\u2019s not the sort of person to cancel and potentially lose money. I told him that I would need to cancel my holiday. He has been very defensive and ended up hanging up on me today after he brought it up again saying that I\u2019m making him feel bad and that my son can look after the dog on his own. My son works 10hr shifts. He can\u2019t leave the dog for 10hrs. (I\u2019m in the UK so not an option for the dog to have access to the garden - I know in the US, dogs can sometimes be left out in the yard all day - nobody does that in the UK as it\u2019s too cold).\n\nI can\u2019t change the date as the hotel has no availability and to cancel it now, I\u2019d lose all the money my friend and I have paid. \n\nI know this isn\u2019t the case for all dog owners, but I treat my dog like my baby. He is a second child to me. That may be wrong, but I can\u2019t help how I feel. He has got me through some bad times. My ex loves my dog and normally treats him the same way as me. \n\nAITA for cancelling my holiday and making my ex \u2018feel bad\u2019?\n\nEdit: just editing to add. I only told him I wasn\u2019t going on holiday anymore because he asked me what time my flight was so we could share a taxi as his flight was the same day. I was planning on not telling I was cancelling until nearer the time, but didn\u2019t want to lie to him. \n\nEdit:Also, a lot of kind commenters are suggesting boarding my pup or getting a dog walker. I\u2019ve been dealing with my dog\u2019s issues (which are significantly improving over time, with meds and training) for around 5 years now, and I\u2019ve extensively researched dog sitters. None in my area take on dogs with complex medical needs (injectable painkiller) and behavioural problems (caused by pain). \n\nEdit: I\u2019m not here looking for alternative dog care to my ex. I\u2019ve researched it all very thoroughly. My behaviourist actually says to me that it\u2019s important that the dog is with people he trusts and knows. She says it would be very irresponsible of me to give me dog to a sitter/walker/boarder who isn\u2019t qualified or experienced with the issues my dog has. I\u2019m just trying to do the right thing by my dog, and by me, as I worry a lot about him.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not ungrateful to my ex. We do a lot for each other. My son and I are the only family he has, and I consider him to be one of my best friends and still family despite us no longer being in a romantic relationship. This is a blip in an otherwise great friendship. He\u2019s not fed up of watching the dog. He loves the dog and asks me if he can walk him, have him overnight just for fun, not just because I\u2019m busy. In the last year he\u2019s had him overnight twice and walked him about 5 times. He\u2019s not \u2018constantly\u2019 doing me favours. I am the primary dog caregiver, my adult son is secondary and my ex helps out my son (his step son for 20 years!) when I take the odd night off.", "created_utc": 1674556943, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10k2o2n/aita_for_cancelling_my_holiday_when_my_dogsitter/", "score": 217, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not something you feel like you can say no to UNLESS you have big plans like he does this time, and it's a huge responsibility being thrust upon you without your true consent tbh.

I don\u2019t trust many people with him.  That being said, maybe it\u2019s time to look at other options.  Could perhaps your son\u2019s care of the dog be supplemented with a dog sitter service?

Your ex volunteerily dogsits for you every time you're on vacation, and the one time he has to cancel because of other engagements you guilt trip him instead of looking for some other solution.", "Soft YTA, you ought to find a good boarder. They're mostly just dog lovers who want to borrow your dog. You probably have enough time to get them to meet beforehand and drill them on the medical procedures.

You don't need to cancel your holiday, you're making that choice rather than looking for other options. \n\n\nSo yeah, YTA.

Or even just come to walk the dog and/or give him medication a couple of times per day while your son is at work. It\u2019s not the same as someone you already know and trust for a decade, but there are wonderful sitters out there (without the need of using a kennel) and you wouldn\u2019t need to cancel your holiday.\n\nThis said, while it\u2019s true your ex had a commitment with you, unless the dog is theirs as well or you are paying him, he was making you a favor and it\u2019s absolutely entitled to change his mind if life happens that way. It\u2019s not nice, but free favors are not unconditional.

My family had one really good sitter who became a family friend and was there when we scattered our last dogs ashes as she was so helpful and loving for him.

He's being a bad friend. THAT is why he feels bad.\n\nDo see if there is any other option besides canceling, though. Do any hotels allow you to bring pets?

It was the trainer that advised me to ask the vet to refer me to a pain specialist behaviourist. I had to push my vet to do that and was on a waiting list and have paid thousands for the best treatment for my dog over and above what his insurance pays. Since then, his behaviour has improved significantly. He\u2019s medicated now and gets acupuncture twice a month and an injectable painkiller every month as well as tablet painkillers every day. Even though the pain is managed, his behaviour is now a \u2018learned\u2019 thing due to him being defensive towards traffic, people and other dogs about the pain.
