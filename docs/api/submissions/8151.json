He's not an asshole either because it's not his job or his responsibility, and he's given you months of advance notice.\n\nI know other people are saying he's the asshole cause he agreed to dogsit and then took it back but I guarantee those people have never felt the pressure of being someone else's only choice for dogsitting. It's not something you feel like you can say no to UNLESS you have big plans like he does this time, and it's a huge responsibility being thrust upon you without your true consent tbh.

I don\u2019t trust many people with him.  That being said, maybe it\u2019s time to look at other options.  Could perhaps your son\u2019s care of the dog be supplemented with a dog sitter service?  You have time to interview and find one you are comfortable hiring.", "Slight YTA\u2026you really can\u2019t research a high quality boarder??? Or other babysitter? I doubt your ex has special qualifications, there are actual dog sitters out there who can learn medical things.

Your ex volunteerily dogsits for you every time you're on vacation, and the one time he has to cancel because of other engagements you guilt trip him instead of looking for some other solution.", "Soft YTA, you ought to find a good boarder. They're mostly just dog lovers who want to borrow your dog. You probably have enough time to get them to meet beforehand and drill them on the medical procedures.

You don't need to cancel your holiday, you're making that choice rather than looking for other options. \n\n\nSo yeah, YTA. Sure, it's not great he backed out on your plans but you definitely made that comment to try and be snide without wven looking into alternative arrangements.", "INFO: have you looked for another dogsitter? \n\nThere are websites like Pawshake where you can find people that would look after your dog at their own place (like your ex would do). Or even just come to walk the dog and/or give him medication a couple of times per day while your son is at work. It\u2019s not the same as someone you already know and trust for a decade, but there are wonderful sitters out there (without the need of using a kennel) and you wouldn\u2019t need to cancel your holiday.\n\nThis said, while it\u2019s true your ex had a commitment with you, unless the dog is theirs as well or you are paying him, he was making you a favor and it\u2019s absolutely entitled to change his mind if life happens that way. It\u2019s not nice, but free favors are not unconditional.

There was a time when I used to dread taking him out on walks, and there\u2019s been many a time when it was at its worst where I\u2019ve been crying while out walking with him.

You talk about medical conditions\u2026 Board him at your very own vet who will obviously be quite familiar with the issues.   Or failing that pay your adult son to take half days at work that week make up for it pay them to be on vacation\u2026 Something else. But I can\u2019t call your ex the asshole for making a plan either. Not great but if a great trip opportunity with friends came up by pure chance the exact same time, also giving you months notice and your own son together an option to watch the dog, I don\u2019t blame him for not passing up the opportunity for something really not that important.  Not saying your dog isn\u2019t important, but it sounds like he would be disrupting the middle of his every day when your son is at work to go just walk this dog only once a day during those work days so it doesn\u2019t sound like that big of a deal\u2026 I know I\u2019m wording that wrong but not enough to miss a great trip.", "Exactly what I\u2019m doing.
