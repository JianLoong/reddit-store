I m38 work overnights sometimes. Usually when my wife leaves work she will text me and say just got out, almost always. Then I will call her when I have a chance. This time I noticed it was getting late past her normal work hour and I texted her if she was out. It took her 10 minutes to respond, she says she was giving a guy she works with a ride to a bar, the bar was closed, then is now giving him a ride to another bar. Then she stays at the bar and drinks with the guy for an hour before giving him a ride home and sitting in the car talking to him for 20 minutes before leaving. During this time I was upset and called/texted a few times. I told her to drive to my work so I could talk to her. When she got there she accused me of being jealous and that in our 10 years of marriage she has never given me a reason to not trust her and that I do not trust her and now she is second guessing or marriage. \n\nNot only that she left without finishing our conversation. She dismissed everything I said and replied with I don\u2019t trust her or deserve her. Then she kept hanging up on me and just berating me up if she picked up the phone to the point that I stopped.  \n\nI tried to be the bigger person and tell her I loved her and she said stop acting like this or I am gone. \n\nHoly shit, yes I may have been pissed because I was like wtf. She didn\u2019t necessarily try and hide it because she told me when I asked her and she never lied about where she was or what she was doing (afaik) I don\u2019t think she really wants a divorce or to be with other people but right I\u2019m really flustered by the whole night. \n\nBut really hanging out with single men after work hours, not telling me, and leaving our kids home alone during those couple hours. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1696588968, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/171906k/aita_for_telling_my_wife_i_dont_approve_of_her/", "score": 12, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't even agree with what she did, but that is an ant hill compared to the mountain of an issue you exposed here. \n\nAlso if your so broke that this was your only option for a set up, then your wife has zero business spending any time going out drinking and spending extra money and gas on others.

She did tell you, the moment you asked. She hung out with a friend, the fact they're single is irrelevant, as she isn't single. The fact that he's a man is also irrelevant, women and men can be friends. You're being irrational and controlling and are conveniently omitting the ages of the children. And if she wants a divorce, it's not necessarily because she wants to be with other people, it's because she's sick of your controlling bs. As she told you. You're not competing with other dudes.

She refuses to see just how fucking suspicious it really is to go bar hopping with some rando like you're single in your twenties.

The defensive tone in my opinion sounds like she is either about to cheat or already has - or is considering it.  Since there are some gaps in her messaging you she is out of work it\u2019s hard to know for sure if there have been other occasions where this has happened. \n\nIn terms of red flag behavior, a married woman going out with a guy from work alone without any notice or even the consideration of a heads up (and that it is very out of character) leaving your kids home alone longer than usual is also very suspect of cheating. There is no context to her interactions with this man prior to this occasion, and the way she reacted when you questioned her sounds very odd / off also. Something is going on here. For context if you were the woman and she was the man in this picture I\u2019d say the same thing. \n\nSounds as if she is thinking of leaving the marriage. If she didn\u2019t cheat already (as in having sex with the guy) [or emotional cheating] it could be building to that, or could be seeing her options. \n\nIf you want to stay married I strongly recommend marriage counseling.

How about a single lesbian or bi coworker who was single?\n\nIf you trust her and him that there is/was no cheating, then their couple status does not matter, and this is a mental block you need to get over.  Women are allowed to have friends. Same with men. My husband\u2019s best friend is a woman. She was single for years. I had zero issue with it. My best friend is a guy. We spend loads of alone time together. Husband has zero issues with it. \n\nIf your issue was \u201cyou left the kids home alone for Hours\u201d, then you have to rephrase your concerns. You still need to apologize because it really does should like \u201chow dare you have friends\u201d and \u201care you cheating on me\u201d rather than \u201cyou didn\u2019t come home and left our kids alone. (How old are they??)", ">I told her to drive to my work so I could talk to her.\n\nYeah-this line was a massive red flag, especially since you were so worried about the kids being home alone and all that.", "Why don't you let a 13 year old be a 13 year old and not place parental responsibility on them?", "Wtf.? Are you serious? No. The 13 year old cannot manage the 4 year old", "This is beyond shitty parenting and your first gripe is about the wife getting time away from the kids lol. Special kind of stupid\u2026", "Edit grammar", "Millions of kids have grown up as latch key kids and have turned out fine or better than their peers. It\u2019s not a big deal. One of the kids is 13 they are old enough to be home alone.", "I saw in another reply that OP mentioned 4, 10, 13. \n\nAs it's framed here, I think there are red flags on both sides. Obviously it's just one side of the story, so we don't know what has been omitted, if anything, though", "Fair enough, they should get a babysitter.", "It sounds like she does daily already. But the AH isn't about how he treats the kid (they're both AHs for that) but his controlling behaviour a towards his wife.", "It\u2019s not okay for that 13 yr old who is being parentified and will be fucked up the rest of their life.  This guy doesn\u2019t give a shit about leaving his kids home alone without a parent because he does it all the time. His wife did something he didn\u2019t like and he went off the rails in a controlling way and is using the kids as a rationalization.", ">13 they are old enough to be home alone.\n\nUntil something happens. You can't expect a 13yo to handle all situations accordingly. \n\nThat would just be very, very naive.", "Yeah I'm gonna change to an ESH I think, just not for the reasons OP thinks his wife sucks.", "[deleted]", "Jesus why are you people are always so dramatic? This kid will most likely be fine like most kids in human history that also had to take care of their siblings. Latch key kids are the kids most suited to actually being independent and leaving the home. I can\u2019t even tell you how many kids I knew at college who couldn\u2019t do laundry, cook, clean, or set their study schedules because their parents did everything for them. You know who didn\u2019t struggle with those concepts? The kids who stayed at home by themselves without their parents dictating everything or doing everything for them.", "That\u2019s why you teach your kids to call you or 911 in an emergency \ud83d\ude12 \n\nWhy do you people act like teenagers have no agency or are utterly useless? They\u2019re fully capable of taking care of themselves if you don\u2019t baby them and teach them.", "But he didn't do that. He made her go to his work to talk to him first. If it was really about the kids, he'd have told her to go home immediately, so they aren't alone any longer than they already were.\n\nAnd it's not a random dude. OP said in another comment he knows the guy, he's his wife's work colleague, who seems like a solid dude."]}
