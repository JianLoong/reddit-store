This is their mess.", "While I do agree, that actual DUI, and OVI's are bad. You must live in a nice bubble if you don't know/realize that alot of ppl get these charges for total bull crap, and many for not even actually driving, anything! Do you know ppl have gotten them while mowing their lawn?? On a riding mower, in their yard? Ppl have gotten them sitting in their car, having not driven, waiting to sober up, but didn't know they couldn't have keys in ignition, or they could/would get an OVI, DUI. You're either not old enough to drink or not part of an income class that ever really deals with law enforcement, or you'd realize what started as a good thing, MADD, and drunk driving regulations, have been boiled down so massively by money hungry bureaucrats, that it no longer remotely resembles what it started out to be. I mean do you realize ppl have gotten DUI 's for legit having 1 glass of wine with dinner, and driving home?? Yet, ppl can drive after smoking dabs, or any of the ultra high test weed that's out there today... Or on their pain meds, etc. As long as they're aware of the effects to themselves before operating heavy machinery, they're cool. Now, do I think it's cool to have 4,5,6, drinks and drive? No of course not, but should someone who has 1 drink be punished the same as someone who has many? No, I don't agree. Or someone almost 21, under the legal limit, if they were 21, being charged and treated the same as the person way over the limit?? But over 21. no not remotely. Do you realize what getting one of these charges, usually maliciously, does to someone?? We're talking a minimum of $10,000 in lawyers, fines, probation, mandatory drug and alcohol testing, for years! Major involvement of gov in their lives, losing jobs, losing income, losing vehicles. It's become beyond ridiculous. Oh, and as a recovering addict and avid watcher of karma, I can tell you for a fact the things you judge harshest, are the things that will touch you most closely in life. So try not to be too judgemental, cuz in my experience personal and non, it'll wind up being you or someone very close to you experiencing exactly what you judged so harshly.", "My town does this. They also have a newspaper in the gas stations that gets released every month called just busted. I love looking at it. I find some many people I went to high school with.", "Imagine trying to defend DUIs. Besides, the former boss wasn't charged \"for nothing\".", "In the US this is untrue. We have free speech and employers can absolutely give a bad reference. If If it false AND defamatory the employer can be sued. Other than that, no. This one of the most common wrong beliefs about US law.", "> former employers can be sued for providing a negative reference if it\u2019s invalid and it results in the loss of an opportunity\n\nYou just repeated what they said.", "You don't understand what free speech is. Free speech simply means that the government cannot limit your speech, and even that isn't necessarily true. It does not free individuals for holding other individuals accountable. \n\nEmployers can be sued because they gave a bad reference. If they say literally one word out of line in a bad reference they can be sued. They have also been successfully sued for giving a bad and true reference. That is why the current policy for any intelligent employer is to confirm the dates the employee worked there, period.", "Free speech is that the government cannot retaliate against you for criticizing it. It has nothing to do with ANY corporation.", "Free speech doesn't mean freedom of consequences especially if it's not the government. Which is exactly what you said, they can be sued for this. But honestly. I can't go around threatening people without reasonable expectation that i can get in trouble for harassment. It just means i can say that the government sucks and i can't be prosecuted in any way for it", "LOL, right?  They told them they were wrong, and then explained why they were wrong by saying the same thing but using different words.  \n\nWild.", "NTA - it's public knowledge, not something private.  If HR covers it up, you should try to take it more public IMO.", "I would have sent it to HR myself in addition to former coworkers, so if you\u2019re an AH I\u2019m an even bigger one. Cheers!", "NTA  I've had some really wretched bosses, and if i were in your place, I'd probably print it out and frame it - just to cheer me up when I was having a bad day.\n\nYour old boss' current status is public information, not something that someone had to hack a database to divulge. Would it be bad form to post it on FB with a rude title? Yup. Getting ahold of previous employees to share the news is more akin to gossip, but may provide some needed emotional/ psychological relief to those that she ran over roughshod.", "Right? It was an absurd level of nonsense and only those who called her \"queen bee\" and treated her like she was the best thing since sliced bread were free from her micromanagement, badmouthing to coworkers, and general harassment. And if she didn't get her way she would yell at people in meetings and start rumors.", "I'm sure some folks were tempted to blast her on fb. But to my knowledge we only shared the info and one person reported it to our former HR.", "It's fair that she may be in active alcoholism. But often folks don't get help until they hit rock bottom. I hope that if she has a problem she will seek help.", "Driving while intoxicated is inexcusable. Being wrongly arrested for driving while intoxicated is a different thing.\n\nAlso, judging somebody for something has no effect on whether that thing will happen to you.", "All the things you listed as \u201ctotal bull crap\u201d reasons for a DUI are legit legal reasons to be charged with DUI. Also you *can\u2019t* legally drive while high on any of the substances you listed. What are you even talking about, and why are you trying to defend DUIs so hard? Got a few of your own?", "She's someone who was behind the wheel of a car and was pulled over. She could have killed someone. Also the other scenarios you listed are legitimate DUIs and could also result in killing someone. If someone is impaired they shouldn't drive. Just because you're under 21, that doesn't mean your drunk driving won't cause harm. I don't think there's a ton of people who have been erroneously charged like you seem to be implying, as you have to blow over .08 to be arrested.", "> They have also been successfully sued for giving a bad and true reference.\n\nDo you have any citations for this? I've heard of unhinged people suing over a bad (but accurate) reference, but never heard of anyone winning in court.\n\nAlison Green, an HR expert who runs the site Ask A Manager, [says as much](https://www.askamanager.org/2010/06/its-not-illegal-to-give-bad-job.html), that it's not illegal to give a bad reference but some companies just don't want the headache.", "Serious question: how would a job seeker know if they got a bad reference? It\u2019s not like the prospective employer would tell them?", "They might. Something a suspicious friend did was have a friend call asking for references and record what they said. One employer was saying a lot more than confirming dates.", "Arrests are public record so whatever but this just puts you on her level especially if doing it on company time. I guess if it makes you happy though do you.", "Nta, but if you wanted revenge, making public posts of that info and mugshot could get results. Of course I wouldn't ever suggest you do that...", "NTA she sowed these seeds, now comes the harvest.", "Like seriously tho! Can't fire someone who doesn't work there anymore \ud83d\ude02 I'd say spread that shit all over. Your ex boss is an asshole and deserves it.", "oh, no you Link*dint!*", "If someone blows a .08 after a glass of wine @ dinner, they\u2019re either lying about it being one glass or are such a lightweight that it\u2019s entirely irresponsible for them to be drinking that with the intent of driving. \n\nThe amount of false accusation for DUI vastly under shadow how many legitimate and incredibly damaging ones there are. I understand also driving on dabs and pain pills is bad (and illegal) but those being bad does NOT make DUI any less horrific"]}
