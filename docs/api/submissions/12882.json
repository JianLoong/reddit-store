Like, unforgivably horrible things to say about a literal child.\n\nWhat you said is nowhere near as bad. Annabelle telling you that you should have empathy for her is completely deaf to what empathy is- a two way street. You do not have to have empathy for someone who clearly has no empathy for you.

Bravo for her incredible generosity!\n\nShe's a nitwit. Just because something works for her own life doesn't mean it works for someone else. not logically, not logistically, not emotionally, etc. Don't bother with her anymore, she is ridiculous and shortsighted and isn't using a single braincell when she opens her mouth.

He literally has an entire team behind him :) But you didn't rub that fact in Stellas face, because you are a sane responsible adult.
