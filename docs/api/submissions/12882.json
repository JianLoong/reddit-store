She has made backhanded comments implying that a mother does not truly love her children unless she stays home.\n\nRecently, Stella made a comment that she expected Jordan to become a criminal when he grows up because he has \u201cno father figures\u201d & a mother who \u201cwould rather work than do what\u2019s best for him.\u201d\n\nIn the past, I have done my best to shut down Stella\u2019s comments by remaining firm without being outwardly angry.

I spoke to Annabelle about the situation, and she told me that I was also in the wrong with my words.\n\nAnnabelle pointed out that Stella likely does regret agreeing to have the kind of marriage that she and Robert have, rather than one based on romantic connection.

But that I should try to extend empathy toward Stella and be more understanding of her emotions. Annabelle told me that I should be the one to apologize first & to not pressure Stella for an apology until she says she\u2019s ready.\n\nI agree with Annabelle that my words were harsh, but I still feel Stella needed to hear them.

Passive aggressive behavior like that has no place around healthy children. If she's insecure or jealous, she can take advantage of her situation to get therapy.

She should see  therapist to help her. You can't be her therapist. She made certain choices for her partner, nothing to do with you. She isn't in an abusive situation that you need to help her out of. If she's unhappy, let her talk to her partner and a therapist.\n\nYou may consider setting some hard boundaries with her.

She wants to be independent, raise just one child, and make her own life choices.

I would continue giving sister space until she apologizes and stops projecting", "NTAStella is toxic as heck and you should not have that kinda talk around you or your kid. i say you do not own her any apology, her sexist small minded comments where way worse than what you said.", "NTA You go right on succeeding at life, don;t let Stella's jealousy interfere.", "NTA. You let it go on too long, you are not your sister\u2019s punching bag. She is jealous of you and that is her problem. Keeping a civil tongue is a bare minimum standard to let someone stay in your life and be around your son.\n\nI don\u2019t think a true friend would try to convince you to apologize to your abuser. Big, big side eye to Annabelle. Something\u2019s weird with that one imo.", "NTA\n\nHer comments are out of line. Working full time doesn't indicate you care more about work. It means you care about having a roof over your head, something that she doesn't have to worry about. \n\nI would stop trying with your sister. She owes you an apology for being uneducated in life. She's making generalisations based on crappy information.", "Why does Annabelle believe that Stella should be handled delicately just because she was rude to you first?

I\u2019m very sorry you were so unfortunate in your sibling assignment.", "You could have reacted better to your sisters comments but your NTA. It\u2019s hard not to let the lizard brain take over and become defensive especially when they are targeting your child.\n\nI\u2019m not going to judge where your sister is coming from as it\u2019s not by place. I would apologize for saying what you did but let her know that her comments are not appropriate and will no longer be tolerated. \n\nI was a single mom from the time my son was 3 and I could never have made it work without my parents being there to help when I had to work. His dad wasn\u2019t much of a father figure either. Sadly at 28 he has a degree in chemistry and a great job where he makes more money than I do lmao. Ignore the BS  about how he will turn out. The type of parent he has is far more important than the number or how they make it work.", "NTA she\u2019s projecting because she\u2019s a married single mother. Your response was harsh but you said what needed to be said.", "Stella did need to hear those words from you.\nNta\nStella needs counciling.\nAnd you need to not allow her near your child if she is saying that stuff where he could hear it.", "nta", ">Annabelle told me that I should be the one to apologize first & to not pressure Stella for an apology until she says she\u2019s ready.\n\nNo thanks. Your sister has been verbally going after you for awhile but decided to move onto your son. No apology after that. Stella can cry in her hundred dollar bill stash. NTA.", "ESH. Implying Stella doesn't love her husband is harsh. Implying you don't love your son is also harsh.\n\nAlso, I'm so confused. If you're unmarried how are you supposed to raise your son without working? She expects you to marry anyone who will have you so you can experience the joy of being a stay at home mom?", "NTA almost ESH", "ESH. You don\u2019t know they have a loveless marriage. You just assume. \nWhile I get where she comes from: children in fatherless homes have higher crime rates, poverty rates, suicide rates, divorce rates, incarceration rates, and pretty much every negative statistic known to man, it isn\u2019t her place to look on you negatively for not prioritizing a relationship with some random guy.", "Soft YTA on what you said, but NTA on needing to say something to your sister. If your sister has not indicated she is unhappy in her marriage then you and Annabelle are simply guessing at what her problem is with you. Stella may be happy with her arrangement and believe everyone else should want the same.\n\nIf you apologize, then apologize for what you said, but let Stella know that you are not her and you love your son. Her lack of respect for you and Jordan means you need to go low contact with her. Not everyone can have her life or may want to. Every decision you make you make out of love for Jordan. If she can't see that then your relationship with Stella isn't what you thought it was. You may love her, but may not like her right now.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She insulted your lifestyle, called you a bad mom and said your son is doomed to be a criminal. If you apologize, it should only be for your choice of words. Make it clear that you are hurt and angry about the things she has said to you, and that if she can\u2019t respect you as a sister and a mom then you will be low contact for the time being. Your sister isn\u2019t the only one with feelings and she trampled all over yours. You\u2019re not required to take verbal abuse because you\u2019re family. \n\nIt sounds like she probably does regret her life choices and might feel trapped in her situation. SAHM\u2019s can start to feel trapped and powerless, but guilting you into adopted the same lifestyle so you can be miserable together is ridiculous.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need people in your life trying to tear you down in order to lift themselves up. Do you really want people in Jordan\u2019s life who feel that way about him? Aren\u2019t you afraid of what she might say to him when you aren\u2019t around? You are not responsible for your sisters marriage or her feelings. Fuck that noise. Annabelle can go chew rocks with her shitty ass advice.", "NTA. Only apologize if you really feel the need to do so, and it's heartfelt. However, when or if you do apologize, you make sure to tell Stella that you will not accept any more backhanded statements against you nor your child. And, if she can't control herself, then you will only communicate when necessary. She needs to know that her statements are not okay and need to stop", "What does Annabelle know?

Apologize for what - defending yourself? Annabelle is just another \"don't rock the boat\".\n\nDon't chase your sister. She has insulted you and your poor child. SHE is the one that has to apologize.

I find it laughable that Annabelle thinks you should be empathetic to Stella after Stella s**ts on you and your parenting.... Stella is not being a decent sister, Stella is being a judgemental bully and do you really want Jordan around judgemental bullies who tell him he's going to grow up to be a criminal?\n\nLeave Stella be.... you dont need to apologise", "NTA and Annabelle is wrong", "Want to show some statistics for that global supposition there????? Jesus aren't you an A H!", "NTA your sister is, if anything you a deserved an apology and I would go LC with her until she does. She can't dish it with out without being able to take it.

NTA NTA NTA", "I don't care how damned insecure your lifestyle makes Stella feel, she has been saying things to you that are far more cutting, undermining, and cruel than your comment about her marriage being a financial arrangement.\n\nGiven how critical she is of you, and the dire predictions she makes about your son, I'm almost surprised that you have enough to do with her to notice when she goes NC.  I would think it would be a relief to get some distance from her hatefulness.\n\nNTA", "You gave her a reality check after multiple times of dealing with her nonsense and unrealistic values. She got what she deserved in my opinion if you can\u2019t take the heat get out of the kitchen.", "NTA.  Stella needs to STFU and keep her anide comments to herself.  She seems jealous that you're happy and content with your life.", "YUP. \n\nThe things she is saying are absolutely horrible. Like, unforgivably horrible things to say about a literal child.\n\nWhat you said is nowhere near as bad. Annabelle telling you that you should have empathy for her is completely deaf to what empathy is- a two way street. You do not have to have empathy for someone who clearly has no empathy for you. Toxic empathy is when you give and give and care and care and neglect yourself in the process.\n\nThat\u2019s what you have here- you are giving her a LOT of leeway because you know that things in her life are hard. And you are letting her pile on to you, even though it clearly hurts, But to say that you don\u2019t love your son because you have to work is absolutely horrid. To say he will be a criminal is ridiculous. And to believe that she is justified and correct in saying these things is absurd.\n\nHer problems are not your problems, particularly not if helping her with them or supporting her through them is taking a toll on you, which is clearly what\u2019s happening.\n\nDo not listen to Annabelle. Nothing you said is anywhere near the things Stella has said and she does not seem willing to apologize or even acknowledge her own bad behavior.\n\nYou didn\u2019t force her to marry her husband. It doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s planning to leave him for a more emotionally fulfilling situation. She wanted a bed with expensive sheets, now she has to lie in it. NTA"]}
