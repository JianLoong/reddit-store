Stella is not only envious and jealous, she is a coward.\n\nStella being in an unhappy and miserable state is no excuse for her to say something as vile as because you're a working single mom that your son is going to be a damn criminal. I'm sorry, but if I had a sister that comment alone might have been worth a well whipped ass for her.\n\nYou don't get to say or do things that are out of line and then act hurt when called out. As my brother always says, \"You can't be the bully and the victim.' You should expect the same lumps that you dole out.\n\nStella owes you an apology. She was wrong. If you apologize, she will think that she is justified for saying something inherently misogynistic and cruel about the way you're choosing to raise your child. The truth is, it's better for a child to be in a healthy environment with a single parent than it is to be in a toxic one with both parents.", "NTA If my sister ever spoke about my child the way Stella spoke about yours, it'd be the last day I called her my sister. Have some strength in your convictions, OP. Stop calling and texting. The only contact you should be tolerating from Stella is a grovelling apology.", "I think you should go and apologize and thank her so much for the offer. Because obviously if she thinks you need to be a stay at home single mom she must be offering to replace your income herself. Tell her you have drawn up a contract for your yearly salary with a cost of living increase each year for her and her husband to sign. \n\nSeriously though how does she think your bills are paid? Does she think that you work for fun or something? I am a single mother and I work to live. If I don\u2019t work, then there is no money for the bills.", "This is parallel with a saying in my country: \"People who say whatever they want end up hearing whatever they don't want\"", "Yta. Single mothers raise junkies, criminals and failures.", "No one forced Stella to marry for money. She made her own choices. That doesn't give her the right to verbally abuse you or your son. She's refusing to show any empathy for you. Don't apologize. If you do she'll keep abusing you. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou've been enduring that for quite a while, why does Annabelle say that YOU have to be the one to apologise and be empathetic?", "NTA, did your sister show you sympathy whenever she insulted your parenting and child? No? Then why should you show sympathy now?", "NTA. \n\n>try to extend empathy toward Stella and be more understanding of her emotions\n\nWhy? Stella implied you're a bad mother because you're not doing it her way. What is there to empathize with?", "NTA, you sister needed to be shut down because what she was saying is toxic and harmful to you and your son. It was all coming from a place of insecurity but that doesn't mean you get to be her emotional punching bag.\n\nYour sister would probably benefit from therapy.", "Uhm, no. NTA. \nPlease don't be a doormat like your friend. Think of the example you set for your child.", "NTA.  Stella's remarks are insulting, cruel and not supported by the facts.  I was a single mother and someone accused me of working so I could buy expensive steaks and fancy clothes.  I told them I was working because I didn't want to live in a homeless shelter with my child.  My child turned out just fine.  In fact, better than a lot of kids with a SAHM who did everything for them.", "NTA and she doesn't deserve your sympathy or empathy.  Your sister is a vile and miserable person.  She is projecting her misery onto you.  What's the old saying, \"Misery loves company\".  You are content with your life and evidently, she is not.  Still, that doesn't give her the right to say hateful things about you and your son.  No apology required in my book.", "NTA and Annabelle is clueless. Stella literally said she expects your child to end up in prison. I sincerely hope she isn\u2019t saying any of these things in front of your child. An attitude like that is not going to be fixed with empathy and understanding. And it\u2019s not deserving of empathy either. Stella needs to be made to understand that her comments and her attitude are unacceptable and will not be tolerated. I honestly have no idea why you didn\u2019t shut that shit down hard enough to stop it the very first time she said something.", "First of all, tell Annabelle to fuck off. Your sister\u2019s insecurities or projections or whatever she has going on doesn\u2019t have shit to do with you or your son. She is being presumptuous and pompous about your son and the type of man he will become based on your \u201cmistakes\u201d as a mom. I don\u2019t know why you even stay in contact with her or try to talk to her? She put you down constantly and your SON. You are allowing her to emotionally abuse you and your son if he ever hears or knows of things being said like this. Annabelle may be right and your sister may hate her life but she needs to CHANGE that for herself, not attack you!", "Even if (and that's a big fat *IF*) you crossed a line by snapling at her, it was only because you reached the end of your patience. NTA", "NTA. There is a saying in Russian culture \u201csomeone who marries for money will end up earning every penny.\u201d", "NTA\n\nStella is a grown ass woman. It'd be one thing if she was 15 and acting like this, but the fact that she's grown and acting likely a bratty teenage girl is inexcusable. You're not her mommy, it's not your place or your responsibility to coddle her. She's your adult sister. She made her bed, she can lay in it. If your sister can't take it she shouldn't be dishing it. And you can't even compare what the both of you said as the same thing. Stella was being presumptuous, judgemental and straight up bullying OP because of jealousy and self loathing. While OP was simply stating the obvious truth that Stella needed to hear because if OP didn't, Stella would have never relented. Definitely NTA. And let's be honest, she was way more mature about it than most of us probably would have been.", "NTA. One of a few things is happening here in the background, but the result is the same.\n\n1.\tStella regrets marrying into a position where she is a SAHM since they do tend to be financially restricted and taken for granted in a bad partnership. \n2.\tStella actually enjoys being a SAHM but feels insecure about it due to the prerogative some people have that SAHM don\u2019t do anything and just use their husbands money while lazing about. \n3.\tStella actively regrets becoming a SAHM because she sees the freedom you have to work or not be home with the kids all the time.\n4.\tStella genuinely enjoys being a SAHM and/or completely believes her BS. She genuinely believes you\u2019re a bad mom if you don\u2019t stay at home with the kids, the a woman\u2019s/moms place is not to work outside the home but in it, and basically has drank the step ford housewife kool aid.\n\nRegardless of the reasoning, the result is she has placed her identity in this role and convinced herself she is not just doing the right thing, but what\u2019s *best*. She\u2019s a martyr to her own cause because that makes her feel important and gives her a sense of worth.\n\nYou..are not likely to change her mind on that. Perhaps she breaks down one day and reveals to you she is deeply unhappy, but more than likely she stays \u201cholier-than-thou\u201d.\n\nI would just steer clear of her when you can. If it brings meaning to her life to carry that role that\u2019s great, but it doesn\u2019t give her the right to admonish others.", "Unwilling to pass judgement since I don't fully understand the situation, but it seems to me like you feel like you have something to apologize for and I'd encourage you to do so. At the end of the day we can't control how others act or what they say and do, but we fully control what we do. It sounds to me like you are a good person who wants to be the best version of yourself and that may mean apologizing without expecting anything in return. I hope you have a great day!", "Nta but Stella sounds like a major Asshole", ">But that I should try to extend empathy toward Stella and be more understanding of her emotions\n\n...So Annabelle is basically telling you to be quiet and that you should be your sisters doormat and have no right to defend yourself. I think there are things about you that Annabelle doesn't like as well.... NTA, protect your kid AND yourself. Stella is getting more and more Toxic and misogynistic and you DON'T need to expose yourself to that. Commenting on her feelings about her husband was a *little* much unless she has flat out told you she has no feelings for him or that she straight up married for money, but it is nowhere near as hostile as she's been getting.", "Annabelle needs to fuck off honestly", "ESH. You could have noped out as soon as she started making these comments or at least set a boundary and walked away every time she said shit. But you waited until you boiled over and attacked her instead. Also you have no idea is she regrets her decision and that's why she's lashing out; I'm guessing you just hit where you thought it would hurt the most.", "NTA - your sister's comments are coming from a place of insecurity but are still really cruel. She wants your son to fail, to be a criminal, to feel unloved because if he doesn't then that makes her sacrifices worthless.  Who wishes that on a child no matter what you think of your life? She owes your son and you an apology for that. Please tell me that neither Jordan or her children were around when she said that.  \n\nYou are very different people. Your life suits you and it sounds like you are doing well. But she made a conscious decision to be a house wife and a mother. I suspect your lifestyle would not have been a bed of roses for her either.  I'd probably not have said she married for money as though true, it wasn't the money she wanted - it was the security, the comfort, the stability. And it is fine to be risk adverse but own that is the decison you made. \n\nYou owe her an apology for staying something that implies she is a gold digger and a pontentially a sex worker. But she owes you a much bigger one for trying to validate her life at your expense. Empathy is good but it can insist with boundaries - you can understand the behaviour but still want it acknowledged it is wrong and not to be repeated. I suspect if you don't hold this line, your sister will keep pushing because by giving into her, you've accepted she's right. People don't tend to realise when they are being placated, they take it as justificaiton and that will do more damage to your relationship long-term.", "NTA. Why is it that we always have to \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d instead of making people accountable for their actions?", "So sick and tired of seeing friends or family tell the victim to \"be the better/bigger person & apologise\"..\n\nYour sister has been throwing shades at you for a bit and the one time you put her in her place you're the bad guy? No..You did right by telling her just bc she hates her choices in her life doesn't mean she gets to shit on your life.\n\nYour sister has the issues not you she needs to apologise to you. Don't listen to Annabelle..she's wrong here..\n\nYour sister literally was shitting on your son his upbringing and said he will be a criminal that's disgusting..and what you said wasn't even close to how harsh judgemental and vile your sisters words were.", "NTA", "NTA Annabelle and Stella are though", "NTA \n\nyou deserve an apology and especially your son. she said your son would be a criminal because he \u201chas no father figure\u201d and that \u201cyou pretty much dgaf.\u201d nahhhh you deserve an apology first.", "NTA. Just because you\u2019re insecure, don\u2019t be taking it out on others. You don\u2019t deserve that kind of treatment from her.", "She called son a criminal!  Don't try to psychoanalyze her, you have to just end the relationship.  You can't stay friendly with someone who insults you all the time.", "NTA \n\nNo offense to your friend, but she really needs to get some depth perception. There is no reason to apologize to your sister, even if your words were harsh. Maybe it\u2019s time to LC with your sister for bit until she gets the professional help she needs", "Nta, stella deserved it", "Your words might have been harsh, but hers were cruel and biased. In my mind, there\u2019s no comparison between the two. \n\nFor your sons sake, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d even bother trying to reach out to her if I were in your position. \n\nShe can come to her senses and apologize, or she can GTFO. \n\nNTA", "You can be empathetic without also being a doormat.  Your friend, Annabelle, appears to believe the heavy insults and criticisms flung at you by your resentful sister transfers the burden of your sister\u2019s discontent to you.  It is as if Annabelle sees you as owing your sister yourself as a dog she needs to kick.  \n\nYour sister\u2019s anger is wrapped up in her not wanting to change anything in her life while resenting you for enjoying yours.  That is an entitlement attitude that she deserves what she wants in life but you don\u2019t. \n\nPutting your sister in her place is your responsibility to yourself.  Stop talking it over with Annabelle who may have jealousy issues herself.  Let your sister find a friend like Annabelle, while you look for a friend who will support your right to live a life if your own choosing; not one in the service of your sister."]}
