He was supposed to meet me this weekend for a family event and never showed up. I got a call from him, telling me he was in jail because he was drinking and driving and crashed. I was on my way to help bail him out when his roommate called me and explained that he had another girlfriend. Confused, I started asking the roommate who he thought he had called. Turns out that my so-called \u201cboyfriend\u201d was sleeping behind my back for months with a girl he met at the strip club. On the last phone call I received from him, I explained to him that he can sit in jail for all I care because that\u2019s the lowest of lows. He got mad and told me that he was having a hard time in jail and someone needed to bail him out or he would be there for a few weeks.", "created_utc": 1698674630, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ju581/aita_for_not_wanting_to_bail_my_boyfriend_out_of/", "score": 151, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Him crashing while drinking and driving was enough for me to say NTA. Don't like jail then don't be stupid.", "NTA do NOT bail him out. You are responsible for the WHOLE BOND AMOUNT until the judge says guilty/not guilty (which could be in 2 years) not just paying the 10-15% bond fee. If he doesn\u2019t show to his court date or he\u2019s in violation of the bond, they will take the entire bond amount from your credit card or whatever you\u2019re using as collateral. He\u2019s already been lying to you, probably will continue to cheat, he can find someone else.", "Oh I failed to mention that when I went to get my things last night, the new girl was there. She said she\u2019s going to bail him out. This man moved her in behind my back.", "NTA\n\n\"he would be there for a few weeks.\"\n\nHe's in \"Find Out!\"  It's the place you go after \"Fuck Around\".", "NTA.  \nLet the side chick bail him out.", "I know you all are waiting for an update. All I know is his parents are so embarrassed and no one is going to help him. I\u2019m beyond embarrassed myself because what a whirlwind of emotions. My life changed in a matter of 3 hours. Found out my EX boyfriend was in a wreck due to drinking and drinking AND having relations with a stripper.", "NTA. If your ex wants to be stupid and drink and drive he shouldn't be stupid and drink and hump.", "Seems like this is a literal example of FAFO!\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nDump him and let him rot. He endangered innocent lives by drinking and driving, and cheated on you. He is right where he belongs.", "NTA!!!\n\nHe makes himself out to be the AH in many ways...but he is the proud winner of \"stupid prizes\" because he played stupid games.", "NTA. Interesting how he's sat in jail without anyone else - like the new girlfriend, or friends, or family - to bail him out.", "Even without the cheating I would have said don't bail him out.\n\nNTA", "NTA. First off, drunk driving is serious and he should sit in jail for being an irresponsible life risking idiot. Second off, his stripper gf can bail him out. Third, dump his ass without even looking back.", "NTA. Let him sit in there and think about what he has done.", "way to find out after fucking around xD hilarious. NTA", "NTA. \n\ndo not bail that man out. and you shouldn\u2019t even be calling him your boyfriend, he should be referred to as your ex to be honest.", "NTA. He's lucky he didn't kill someone  for one thing.   He FAFO'd", "NTA\n\nSounds to me like he\u2019s right where he belongs. \n\nNow, slap a big ol\u2019 EX infront of that boyfriend and go on living your best life!", "A stripper will have a lot more fluid cash reserves than you, she can better afford to bail his cheating ass out than you.", "NTA \n\n\"Have a drink,  have a drive, go out and get a DUI\" (parody of \"In the Summertime\")\n\n\nSure sounds funny, the only problem is,  is that luckily he crashed and he only wrecked his car.  He could have wrecked lives. I have seen the aftermath of what a drunk driver did to three children walking along the roadside. \n\nOne boy badly crippled for Life,  his sister slightly older lost her leg,  the oldest lost her life. This is what can and does happen.\n\nYou did the right thing, let the prick suffer and actually, I would dump him as a BF.  You don't need that coming on,  if he's that heavy of a drinker,  he doesn't care about others and he won't care about you.", "Nta leave him in jail.  He caused this problem.  He cheated in you.  If you bail him out and take him back you are a huge ahole and deserve him.", "Well that someone can be his other girlfriend.\n\nBullet dodged.\n\nNTA", "Not your problem. He can ask his roommate for help bailing him out.

He was so drunk he crashed his car. This dude deserves to rot in there. Cheating is just the side show honestly.", "Oh well. Nta", "NTA.  Let him stay in there for a while.  At least then you'll know where he is.", "NTA and you need to get tested for stds immediately. I\u2019m sorry you found out this way, but I\u2019m glad you found out that he\u2019s a drunken cheater. Hope your test comes back clean. Good luck.", "NTA, and do not by any means allow this man to manipulate you.

Out!!!!!", "NTA AND DO NOT POST BOND FOR HIM. He already sounds like an AH (Driving while drunk, cheating) and if he jumps bail or whatever, guess who loses their money and for the WHOLE Amount not just whatever percentage you pay/paid? And do you honestly think he'd pay you back?\n\nAlso think about this, he was drunk and on the way to your family event and he was drunk enough to crash how would he have acted at the event?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTime to cut and run.

Don't be stupid.", "Fake", "Pay it then go see judge judy", "YTA for making it about personal relationships/issues. He got drunk and drove, and crashed. I don't think I would bail anyone out who chose to do that. Your more concerned about personal betrayal than him possibly killing someone lol.", "> he was in jail because he was drinking and driving and crashed.

He's not worth your time or money.", "NTA... from the moment you hear he has another gf - you are exempt from all courtesy actions. \n\nHowever y.t.a for considering bailing a drink driver. He deserves every moment he gets in the slammer.", "NTA\n\nYou ex boyfriend can rot in a cell", "Nta. F#ck that dude. Let his wh#re bail him out!", "NTA.  I have zero tolerance for drunk driving.  Let him sit in jail.  I hope the judge presiding throws the book at him.", "NTA he's a drink driver he deserves his jail time and to lose you as a girlfriend for that and the cheating.", "Honestly I'd let him rot in jail just for drinking and driving, the cheating is just icing on the cake.  He is not your problem.  Also please say he's an ex.\n\nNTA", "Wow wtf.  Get him blocked on everything and try to see this as a lucky escape (even though I'm sure it hurts right now). 100% NTA of course!", "Mofo's in horny jail.", "drunk driving is an absolute no go, he should stay in jail and think about what he did. you are absolutely NTA. He however is, by endangering other peoples lives", "NTA play stupid games win stupid prizes", "NTA. Let him rot.", "NTA and probably the most literal FAFO I have seen in this sub.  You won't do him any favors by being an enabler, so let him sit.  He seems to need the time to figure himself out.", "Let him sit and rot. He probably needs it.", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nGood response and if he needs someone to bail him out he can ask his other girlfriend", "NTA. Let his other girlfriend, or his parents, bail him out.", "NTA And please say you dumped him!!!", "Not sure why it's your problem.\nDoes he have parents, siblings, hey even the girl from the strip club, I'm sure any one of them could bail him out.\n\nNTA, textbook definition of fucked around and found out.", "NTA. If he's in jail for a few weeks, that's a few weeks he can't drunkenly kill people with his car.", "NTA\n\nDon't bail him out.\nDrink driving is dangerous and we all know better. All of us.\n\nThe other girlfriend is just icing.", "Ha!! NTA. You would be TA to yourself if you bailed him out. Come on, not just driving drunk but cheating on you too?? I would completely block him. That would be the end of it. Don't be a doormat.", "nta - tell him to call his other gf to bail him out.  let him sit there in jail stewing for a few weeks would serve him right.", "Run!", "Tell him his girlfriend can bail him out. NTA", "NTA\n\nHe was drinking and driving, he deserved to sit in jail for the few weeks at minimum.", "NTA...\n\nI hope you get over him fast... Best practice is to completely ghost him. Let him wonder how life wouldve been with you, without him ever finding out how you are doing.\n\nEnjoy the weekend!", "NTA for leaving him in jail, but it should be more so because why he's there vs the cheating. YWBTA if you bailed him out, but from updates, it appears that you will not be doing that. \n\nPeople who drink and drive are a special breed of horrible. People like this can be good liars and hide just how frequently they engage in that kind of activity. Some people just turn a blind eye to it. And once they've started this pattern of drinking and driving, they only continue to do it more and more thinking that it's okay because nothing bad has ever happened, until they hurt or even kill someone. Even then, they don't always stop drinking and driving. \n\nLeaving him in jail and moving on is the best thing to do, even if that was the only bad thing he did.", "NTA\n\nYou shouldn't be bailing him out anyway. He drank and drove AND CRASHED. He could have killed someone. He sounds like an absolute AH of a person. He bloody well deserves to be in jail.\n\nLet him rot", "100% what I was going to say", "[deleted]", "Even finding him guilty they sometimes in my state take the bail money and use it to pay court costs and fines.", "She\u2019s an idiot too. She should know better being in that world.

Don't bail him out.", "Lol you should add this to the post. You dodged a bullet. Get his friend/roommate that called you a beer or two as a thanks for the heads up.", "There you go then, officially no longer your problem. Let the other woman bail out the cheating low life.

Let her deal with his broke, stupid ass. \n\n\nIf he\u2019s having a hard time in jail, wait until he\u2019s convicted and thrown into prison when he can\u2019t be bailed out. Most states impose a mandatory prison sentence. I\u2019m willing to bet during that time, his girlfriend finds someone new and leaves him and he has to find a ride home after being released.

Block him. You dodged a bullet.", "Wow! How much is the bail?!", "You should be on your way to a clinic for an STD panel.
