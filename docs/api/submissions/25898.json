When I did it was on the assurance it was anonymous, which was standard at the time. You can see where this is going. So I got a call from a second cousin, let's say Jack, who had done an ancestry dna thing a while back. Recently he was contacted by someone it turns out is my biological child. He wanted to connect, I told them to tell him I am happy to give him family medical history, mentioned if me is going to have a kid with someone Jewish to test for taysachs, but that I'm not interested in contact.\n\nWell I guess they kept talking to him without me knowing and now they messaged me saying that he really wants to meet me. I gave the same answer even though t hey were persistent that time. Then they gave him my phone number and he called, I told him I was just a sperm donor, we're related but not family, and he has a family. Then this last weekend I get a call from security at the entrance gate, my second cousin's were there and wanted to be allowed in. I told them not to and went and met them, it was 2 of my second cousins, let's say Diane, and the boy who we'll call Andre. I told them to meet me in a parkinglot outside a grocery store nearby. They insisted on coming in, I declined and told them that or nothing.\n\nSo I told them to leave us alone so I could talk to him, I told I was sorry he made the really long drive for nothing because nothing had changed or was going to. He said it wasn't about my money and I said I believed him and honestly this wasn't about my money to me either. He was obviously emotional and asked if I didn't have any feelings standing there, I told him I sympathized with where he was coming from but I don't consider he and I family, we're biologically related. He had a good family (Diane told me a bit in a rant) and he was a very wanted kid, but by his parents. He asked why I even became a dad then and I didn't I tried to help other people be parents. He got angrier and accusatory and after several nasty comments about my character I told him I was barely out in the world, mostly on my own and working through school, and I was paid to finish in a cup. That's all it was. Then he shouted \"then why did you agree to have me\" and I told him I never would have donated if I knew it wasn't going to stay anonymous. He asked if I meant I regretted donating and I said no because he exists but that I never would have ever donated if I didn't think it would always be anonymous. He cried and ran to second cousins who said things and they left. \n\nThey've been messaging me so much I've started ignoring them, I'm not going to block, but they started going to other family members and while most agree with me a few are vocally opposed and I would like outside opinions.

Also your cousins are AHs for meddling and causing drama.", "Could you contact the boys parents and explain the situation? I have a feeling they don\u2019t know and they need to sit down and have a conversation with the boy about how donating sperm works and what it actually means. NTA.", "I\u2019m the product of a sperm donor (I didn\u2019t find out until I was 38) and we didn\u2019t contact him.  We found out he was a narcissist and convicted racist.  Also found out I had 17 half siblings.  \n\nIt\u2019s not okay for them to ignore your boundaries.  You made an agreement to give sperm and remain anonymous.  You told them no and they still came.  It might be sad for the kid but you don\u2019t owe him anything.  NTA", "NTA - I definitely do NOT think you\u2019re the asshole. You shouldn\u2019t feel any type of way about his.

But this kid is acting like you got his mom pregnant through sex with his \u201cbecome a dad\u201d spiel.\n\nYou DID NOT \u201cbecome a dad\u201d. \nYou donated sperm that may or may not have been used to create embryos.\n\nNTA x 100", "NTA\n\nYour cousins are massive aholes though.", "NTA. You're not a dad. You're a sperm donor. I assume it's your cousins who are feeding into this kids fantasies romanticizing your involvement as something more than it actually was. I would very clearly lay down the law with your cousins if this is going to be an ongoing fight. Strong arming you into being a father because of a sperm donation you made when you yourself were a kid is just cruel.", "NTA\n\nPeople have these heartwarming stories about meeting donors, but they aren't all hugs and kisses. Sometimes, like in your case, you did it to help others, but not to be attached to someone else's child. Sometimes children don't get that. What's worse is that his parents obviously didn't prepare him for this possibility. Further, your relatives should never have encouraged him right from the beginning. Contacting you once to see how you felt was fine, but once they knew, they tried to push their beliefs on you. That's not okay. I feel bad for the kid, but once you reiterated that you wanted to remain NC he went off the handle in an inappropriate way.", "NTA.\n\nI'd warn your second cousins to stop pushing as if you specifically chose to have a child and abandon him or they'll be losing contact with you too. Playing into this boy's fantasy is cruel and hurting him, not helping him.\n\nDonating sperm or eggs is about helping other people potentially become parents, not becoming one yourself, and is certainly not a guarantee that it will create a child. You did not 'choose' to have this kid, his parents CHOSE to use a sperm donation to create him. They chose to have him. He needs to go home to his actual family and sort out whatever is driving him to come to you.", "NTA. What has happened is a change in technology. When you donated, it WAS anonymous and you helped desperate people become parents. You never thought of this as becoming a \"parent\" or that things would one day change. I hope, since you have the boy's number, you will, in the kindest of ways, explain again what you wrote in this post. Also, please don't call it \"rejection\". You never rejected a son, or being a father. You never had a son, and never were a father", "NTA\n\nYou donated sperm anonymously. The modern trend for recreational DNA matching has outed you as the bio father of this kid. You don't owe him anything, and he's the asshole for pushing it.", "NTA.  This isn\u2019t like you had sex and then ditched the mom.  This was a consensually anonymous transaction by you and the parents.  You have no obligation to this kid and I\u2019d say you you handled it quite well.", "NTA. If you explained in the first communication with him your stance on it, as sad as it may have made him, that\u2019s something he needs to come to terms with. He has a family that wants him.", "NTA\n\nYou donated anonymously and it should've stayed that way. Your second cousins helping him find you was disrespecting your privacy not to mention bringing a stranger to your place of residence. That poor boy may have a hard time processing this but it's better than you give him some false hope for a connection that doesn't exist. He's going to have to come to terms with this but I think you made the right choice to tell him the truth and how you feel. \n\nPS. I think it is worth blocking your second cousins they're the assholes in this entire story.", "NTA. You wanted to donate anonymously and did so, when everyone was anonymous. How could you have know you could've been tracked down years later? \n\nThis young man may have wanted to get to know his biological family, but he needed to learn that donors might not want that connection. It's a shame for him but he has to respect your decision on the matter, as does your cousin (who is acting like TA himself, for trying to force the issue).", "NTA. \n\nI'm not asking these questions to be mean, I genuinely want to know. How old is he? Some of the questions he asked like \"Why did you become a dad?\" and \"Why did you agree to have me?\" make me think he's really young or doesn't really understand what a sperm bank is (that's not what I mean but I don't know how to phrase it). \n\nYour second cousins are real a-holes for going to your job to introduce him to you and going to other family members to rally them against you. If they want a relationship with him, that's fine but they need to respect your wishes.", "Definitely not, your cousins are the assholes.  You and the kid are the victims of their assholishness", "NTA. You were nothing but honest about what you wanted a relationship with this kid to look like. You were firm in your boundaries, but it sounds like you were polite even when he was trying to bait you into saying things that would make him more angry because he\u2019s young and upset that this idea he had in his mind of a joyful reunion where y\u2019all had an instant connection is never going to be a reality. From your recounting, it seems possible that he might be having a hard time reconciling the difference between anonymous sperm donor and adopted at birth/any kind of situation where you would have parental rights to sign away. \u201cDo you regret me, do you regret giving me up?\u201d Not relevant. I feel kind of bad for him. \n\nIf anyone is the AH, it\u2019s your cousin who led the kid on instead of just letting it lie. Actually, I misspoke (mistyped?). The cousins are definitely AHs.", "NTA. You are exactly right - you were a sperm donor in a clinic, not helping friends have a baby or deserting this kid's mother. You were, before DNA testing, assured it was anonymous. Turns out that anonymity isn't guaranteed because of things like 23&me. You may need to have a discussion with a lawyer.", "NTA, but your second cousins are AHs who lied to you repeatedly.\n\nThis kid wouldn't have such emotional instability if he came from a \"good family\". He has daddy issues and we can probably guess why.", "I'm an adoptee. I was 47 before I got a message through to my mother. It took months to reach her, having been bounced through several distant relatives and ex-husbands. She could easily have declined to respond, and I'd have never known the difference. She told me how to find my father. I found his contact info, and sent him an email. Luckily, he was very welcoming, also. He flew across Canada to meet me, and welcomed me into his home to meet his family. We still correspond.\n\nBut the whole time, I was terrified of meeting the kind of reception you're giving off, and I would have backed off at the first hint that I was unwelcome. The last thing I'd want to do is to impose myself on someone who doesn't want to meet me.\n\nBut your kid doesn't care, and is being encouraged by the cousins to feel entitled. They're wrong.\n\nYou gave him life; your obligations end there. NTA. Give him all the medical info you have; that's fair. But you don't owe him a familial relationship.", "NTA go for a restraining order if he continues to bother you.", "NTA\n\nBut the family members involved sure as hell are. Where the fuck do they get off giving out your private information?!? Personally, I'd block each and every one of them and go NC. A real family member doesn't do that to someone they love. \n\nThe one thing I'd be doing beside that is to contact the court and get a \"no contact\" order and have the bio son served. He very clearly doesn't know how to take no for an answer. He needs to be forced to stop contacting you using legal means.", "How do you write your will to protect your kids? Do you specifically exclude any known/unknown children that were a result of a sperm sale/donation? Do you specifically exclude children who are not biologically related to specific women (legal spouses?).", "Your title is so misleading but your context backs you up. \n\nYou donated sperm and it was anonymous. You aren't a father and you don't have to have any responsibilities with that kid. Your cousins are being major AHs and I don't think they actually see the situation properly. \n\nNTA", " NTA / you are not his dad. you\u2019re just the guy who helped create him", "NTA I\u2019m not sure I would ever talk to your second cousins again. I think you need to go the legal route to make sure your sperm donor kid doesn\u2019t contact you. I would also update my will that any child from your sperm donations do not receive anything.", "NTA \n\nBut what\u2019s wrong with your cousins?", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't decide to have a kid and be a parent. You donated sperm knowing that it would allow *someone else* to have a kid and become a parent. Your second cousin was/is way out of line. This is absolutely none of their business and they need to stop trying to mediate contact between you two. \n\nI feel for the kid and it's obvious you do too, but you're not his dad. You're just the donor.", "Mannnn wit these DNA kits and no yelling how many people used ya swimmers, you probably gone get alot more of these situations.", "NTA.  They're harassing you.  Let them know you're considering legal options to stop them.", "NTA\nYou may be this kids father but you aren't his dad and he shouldn't keep pestering you. I feel for him, absolutely, but if he's got a family then he should step off. Hope things go okay op", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't \"agree to have him\" and you have no reason to \"feel anything\"... You donated your sperm in a cup so that someone who can't have children could conceive a child, you didn't bang his mom and abandon her during her pregnancy.\n\nYou didn't raise him and leave him in his childhood. You have 0 attachment to him or his family. Your cousins disrespected your boundaries.\n\nI get where the boys coming from, having been actively abandoned by my \"egg doner\" (my actual birth mom who doesn't deserve the title of mom), who also had many kids before and after me... Wondering what family I have out there... But if I did ever try to get in contact, if at any point any of them said no... Then that's that. No means no.\n\nNo is a full sentence.", "NTA and what the hell is wrong with your cousin?? This is absolutely appalling behavior. I can\u2019t even believe someone would do this. Outrageous. \n\nI\u2019m sure the kid was persistent but that doesn\u2019t excuse your cousin completely and repeatedly disregarding your wishes. Their behavior is psychotic.", "NTA\n\nI grew up without a father figure and I always wondered about him. I'm lucky that I had other relatives to rely on tho.\n\nI feel for the kid, but he should not push for a relationship with you", "NTA, I am an adoptee. You have the right to privacy.  I personally have no interest in meeting my bio parents.  Even if I did and they said no it would be the end of it.  Talk to a lawyer and get a restraining order against him.  You may want to seek a legal claim against the relative that gave out your information as well as bringing him to your home.", "You acted like the slap of life. Better it be about this than about not being able to walk after you're hit by a car, injured. Reality can be harsh. This kid has to learn to deal with it. He has parents - you ain't them.", "This is a crappy situation all the way around and absolutely something you could not have forseen when you donated. Never in a million years back in the 1990s and early 2000s did any of us think that DNA tests would become universally available AND that there would be a network like there is now through ancestry and other such websites.\n\nNAH. \n\nHe obviously is feeling an emptiness that he is trying to fill. Assuming he has good parents, you were right to turn him back towards them. And, you are well within your right to choose not to engage with him. That said, I think it would be wise to prepare yourself that there will likely be others that come forward in time. Come up with an elevator speech and an email with health information for your family. If your extended family want a relationship with him, that is their business. And, allow yourself space to process this. You might decide at the end of the day you want a limited relationship with him in the future.", "Nta. Whoever these cousins are that facilitated all this are though.", "NTA. Of course you expected anonymity - at the time you donated family DNA searches weren\u2019t an issue.  Your cousins are absolute assholes for encouraging the boy and bringing him to meet you when they should have been telling him you were not interested in meeting. They\u2019re also assholes for informing other members of your family.", "NTA, but your cousins are. If this kid is under the age of 18, I'm not understanding why his parents would encourage something like this. Did they not know he was wanting to meet you? \n\nThe kid sounds like he needs some therapy, but the responsibility lies with his actual parents to explain why they needed the assistance in having a baby. Your anonymous contribution was hand picked by HIS parents. You didn't \"choose\" to become a dad. \n\nWhat a strange interaction. I have so many questions. Lol", "NTA.

You are entitled to your privacy.", "NTA. Your cousins are.  The kid is not.  I suspect your family was pitching the you just have to meet him and he\u2019ll change or something along those lines.

We don\u2019t know the full picture of his family to make him cling onto you as his dad but, for them to go to a clinic and get inseminated means that he was a child wanted by THEM, not you.

This is one of the instances on why blood doesn't mean family.", "NTA. You made your intentions clear from the beginning when you donated sperm under the understanding of anonymity. It's entirely your choice whether you want to establish a relationship with the biological child now. While it's understandable that he might be curious about his origins, it doesn't change the fact that your original agreement was based on anonymity. You're entitled to your feelings and boundaries, and it's unfortunate that the situation has escalated. Your decision should be respected, and it's important for your family to understand your perspective as well.", "Wow. This is the first post I have ever seen about a biological father not wanting to be in a kid's life in which I have to say NTA. You really caught me by surprise. Your cousins need to grow out of their soap opera phases. They're doing too much. You set a boundary, and it was disrespected. They are not the good guys in the situation.

What a shitty situation for everyone involved.\n\nThe one thing I'd suggest is maybe back off on telling this kid how good he's had it because there's obviously an emptiness for him, along with a lack of understanding that your role in all if thus (sorry for bring crass) was just jerking off into a cup.\n\nIt brings me to wondering what stories his parents have been telling him.", "NTA I feel like there's something totally illegal about this tbh like if you signed a contract to stay anonymous.", "NTA - but I am of the opinion that donors shouldn\u2019t remain anonymous to people.

Sperm banks are predatory as shit, just like blood banks meant for non-donation means; they look for college kids who they can promise up and down will never have any problems with the future and hand them some extra fun money while making thousands of dollars off of it. \n\nOn the other hand, you\u2019ve got a kid who finally realized that he had a chance to understand something about himself that he couldn\u2019t get from his parents\u2014 who found actual family that had been denied to him, who clearly felt lost and was searching for something to anchor him to the world. In his mind, he had a parent out there he had never known who might actually want to know where he got in the world.

Depending on where he was, he might have been bullied or targeted by people who claimed every minor infraction proof that a child needs a *man* in his life, or church kids that shun him and don\u2019t invite him anywhere because he\u2019s the kid with the lesbo moms. The fact they\u2019re upset with you shows that this kid is in more pain than you may see. \n\nNobody wins. A kid feels like shit. Your family believes you abandoned your own.

Would a little contact really kill you? It\u2019s not as if you\u2019re signing up to be daddy. He\u2019s just curious about where he comes from. It\u2019s not a matter of feeling loved or wanted by who he was raised by.

Realistically keeping this physical impenetrable wall is what led to the situation escalating so high. In that situation, it seemed you as the adult lacked empathy and made a poor chose saying you wouldn\u2019t have donated to bring this kid into the world if you knew it would have led to him meeting you. While I understand your side as an outsider and an adult, the kid clearly feels unwanted and how you responded was in a way that pushes people off the edge of the cliff. You\u2019re the adult, and I do believe what you said here was the wrong choice to get the message across.

I just think this stance is very brutalist, very unforgiving, and doesn\u2019t account for the emotional value of others involved in the situation. To me, being human means you can\u2019t simply not care about how you make others feel.

This argument gets thrown around constantly even though it's been a thing to remove anonymity from donors years ago.  \n\nThe reason that supplies are reducing are because there are now ethics and UN rights of the child taken into account.   \n\nThere are now maximum family/children limits so we don't have kids with 200 half siblings who all live in the same city.   \n\nThere are medical/health issues that were conveniently forgotten or just not included about extended family that have resulted in DCP dying from preventable diseases as young adults because the donor just never included it or the anonymity clause meant they couldn't even update their details.   \n\nThere is stricter screening for donors due to the AIDS scare that killed a recipient mother circa 1985 that meant donor records were conveniently destroyed to skip liability (apparently no DCP created in 85?).   \n\nThere are laws to stop egotistic god complex fertility doctors inseminating all their patients to spread their SuPeRiOr seed.  \n\nThere are also more prospective donors understanding the risks of being a donor now, that there is PLENTY of data out there proving that the only people who were NOT part of these unenforceable anonymity contracts are the ones who still are fighting for rights that everyone else has. Refer to the changes in adoption laws, it's basically the same but 20-30years behind because DCP are seen as a product, a commodity traded... and children. Even though many are in their 60s now.   \n\nFinally. There is a massively increased demand for donors due to a cluster fuck of infertility issues related to environmental/genetic/lifestyle factors, and while accounting for the issues above, supply will never keep up with demand. The anonymity issue is marginal compared to every other issue.   \n\n\nOne donor (late 1970s) already stated that he had been thrilled to sign up to a newspaper ad to donate and help infertile couples. When he went and told his colleagues they were all in the same boat, replying along the lines of why would I give my future children away to someone I don't know? That's my genetics and I won't ever know them.   \n\nSo for someone 20-40 years later to say today oh but the supply will go down, donors will get spooked, what about all the poor people who can't have kids? Nah. There is no excuse for ignorance. And if OP also received a nice payment for his donation then he has even less excuse. He traded his genetics for beer money.   \n\nDNA databases mean nobody is anonymous. How do you think the Golden State Killer was found? Please don't make DCP and using DNA companies the scapegoat for the shortcomings and money hungry profits of a multibillion dollar fertility industry.  \n\nYou don't want to be held accountable for a lax choice that impacts someone else's life because beer money? Work for that cash with a real job, don't jizz in a cup and hope it never comes back to haunt you. This is blatantly obvious for anyone mindful enough to do any kind of research instead of focusing on the easy cash.   \n\nBe mad at the clinics making the big bucks from desperate couples willing to use their entire retirement funds just to maybe have a kid. Be mad that they don't give a shit about anything but profits and will lie and bullshit to make mega profits of each donor. \n\nModern science is not being used as a weapon. it's filling in the blanks for many, many people who were traded as gametes and deceived and their identity withheld by at least 3 accountable adults before they even were conceived. That's not a weapon. It's a solution and an answer when DCP are given nothing except being told to be grateful.", "I think that there is no way to guarantee 100% anonymity anymore since the donor can stay out of genetic databases, but they don't know what people in his family tree will do.", "That feels like a big leap. There\u2019s just honestly no way to stay anonymous anymore. OP got found by the kid because a cousin did DNA testing, not even OP himself. Being upfront about the fact that anonymity no longer exists just prevents this same situation happening to more people in the future. \n\nMy mom was adopted in a closed adoption. She did try to find her bio mom a few times half heartedly, torn between not wanting to violate her wishes and half hoping she may have changed her mind (bio mom was a very young teen mom) and never had any success. I did one ancestry test and immediately got a notification I had a strong match that turns out is my mom\u2019s biological sister. A quick google search and I found her mom too, as well as the rest of her siblings. Anyone in 2023 thinking they can do a fully closed adoption or anonymous sperm donation is kidding themselves.", "Well, yes. But that's hardly OP's fault. I can't imagine there'd be a quality relationship whatever happens, as one party is obviously not interested. The people at fault here are whoever is trying to force a relationship on an unwilling participant.", "And sometimes it\u2019s only through being harsh and direct that you can snap an emotional person out of their emotions long enough to understand what they\u2019re being told. He didn\u2019t curse the kid out or threaten him, he told him the cold honest truth that he had been telling him in softer words repeatedly. Those softer words weren\u2019t enough. The harshness was what finally got through to him it seems. He may be a minor but he\u2019s not a small child who cannot grasp what the word \u201cno\u201d means.", "It\u2019s not his father.", "Well .. he is party to it as he was the sperm that was donated", "Just because someone is your sperm donor does not mean they had anything to do with 'where you came from'. Trying to force a relationship on an unwilling party is only going to hurt everyone involved.", "It was a joke. Read my comments below. I\u2019m a lesbian and mom myself.", "Lol, yep. This is incredibly sad that you believe this.\n\nYes, a woman can absolutely be a father figure. Ask any single mom. \n\nA priest can be a father figure even if he\u2019s likely never going to have children and never had any before being ordained.\n\nA penis does not make a father figure. \n\nYour gender does not inherently prevent you from teaching a child about things like a good work ethic, patience, resilience, resolve, and grit. Are these masculine or feminine values? \n\nImportantly, male gender does not inherently make you a father figure either.", "Found the sexist homophobe", "You know what is a normal concept.\n\nRESPECTING PEOPLE PRIVACY AND BOUNDARIES.\n\nThis kid was told not to contact OP but they kept trying and when phone calls and texts didn't work they rrued to rock up on his door step. THAT IS STALKER BEHAVIOUR.\n\nThe kid can want what he wants all he wants but he can not force himself on his sperm doner. IT IS THAT SIMPLE.", "The mothers are though. It\u2019s their job to explain to him the circumstances surrounding his birth.\n\n\nAnd actually, there is now a clause in most sperm bank contracts that talks about ancestry and DNA tests.", "As someone who dealt with surrogacy AND sperm banks, I\u2019m telling you you\u2019re wrong. If a donor says they want to be anonymous that means you can\u2019t even tell said child who the father is. All you can say is he was an anonymous donor. So when his mothers bought the sperm THEY SIGNED A CONTRACT.\n\n\nAnd they didn\u2019t keep up their end of the deal. So it IS A LEGAL ISSUE and they can be held liable.\n\n\nThe thing about secrets is that they always come back and bite you in the ass. They should have been more forthcoming about the situation and then this kid would have known to not go looking.\n\n\nMatter of fact, donors who want to stay anonymous are referred to by a number instead of a name. And how do I know this?? Because I was inseminated with Donor #27295. \ud83d\ude44", "Ok. \ud83d\ude06\ud83e\udd23\n\n\n\nLike I didn\u2019t spend three years in the IVF world."]}
