When I did it was on the assurance it was anonymous, which was standard at the time. You can see where this is going. So I got a call from a second cousin, let's say Jack, who had done an ancestry dna thing a while back. Recently he was contacted by someone it turns out is my biological child. He wanted to connect, I told them to tell him I am happy to give him family medical history, mentioned if me is going to have a kid with someone Jewish to test for taysachs, but that I'm not interested in contact.\n\nWell I guess they kept talking to him without me knowing and now they messaged me saying that he really wants to meet me. I gave the same answer even though t hey were persistent that time. Then they gave him my phone number and he called, I told him I was just a sperm donor, we're related but not family, and he has a family. Then this last weekend I get a call from security at the entrance gate, my second cousin's were there and wanted to be allowed in. I told them not to and went and met them, it was 2 of my second cousins, let's say Diane, and the boy who we'll call Andre. I told them to meet me in a parkinglot outside a grocery store nearby. They insisted on coming in, I declined and told them that or nothing.\n\nSo I told them to leave us alone so I could talk to him, I told I was sorry he made the really long drive for nothing because nothing had changed or was going to. He said it wasn't about my money and I said I believed him and honestly this wasn't about my money to me either. He was obviously emotional and asked if I didn't have any feelings standing there, I told him I sympathized with where he was coming from but I don't consider he and I family, we're biologically related. He had a good family (Diane told me a bit in a rant) and he was a very wanted kid, but by his parents. He asked why I even became a dad then and I didn't I tried to help other people be parents. He got angrier and accusatory and after several nasty comments about my character I told him I was barely out in the world, mostly on my own and working through school, and I was paid to finish in a cup. That's all it was. Then he shouted \"then why did you agree to have me\" and I told him I never would have donated if I knew it wasn't going to stay anonymous. He asked if I meant I regretted donating and I said no because he exists but that I never would have ever donated if I didn't think it would always be anonymous. He cried and ran to second cousins who said things and they left. \n\nThey've been messaging me so much I've started ignoring them, I'm not going to block, but they started going to other family members and while most agree with me a few are vocally opposed and I would like outside opinions.

Also your cousins are AHs for meddling and causing drama.", "Could you contact the boys parents and explain the situation? I have a feeling they don\u2019t know and they need to sit down and have a conversation with the boy about how donating sperm works and what it actually means. NTA.", "I\u2019m the product of a sperm donor (I didn\u2019t find out until I was 38) and we didn\u2019t contact him.  We found out he was a narcissist and convicted racist.  Also found out I had 17 half siblings.  \n\nIt\u2019s not okay for them to ignore your boundaries.  You made an agreement to give sperm and remain anonymous.  You told them no and they still came.  It might be sad for the kid but you don\u2019t owe him anything.  NTA", "NTA - I definitely do NOT think you\u2019re the asshole. You shouldn\u2019t feel any type of way about his.

But this kid is acting like you got his mom pregnant through sex with his \u201cbecome a dad\u201d spiel.\n\nYou DID NOT \u201cbecome a dad\u201d. \nYou donated sperm that may or may not have been used to create embryos.\n\nNTA x 100", "NTA\n\nYour cousins are massive aholes though.", "NTA. You're not a dad. You're a sperm donor. I assume it's your cousins who are feeding into this kids fantasies romanticizing your involvement as something more than it actually was. I would very clearly lay down the law with your cousins if this is going to be an ongoing fight. Strong arming you into being a father because of a sperm donation you made when you yourself were a kid is just cruel.", "NTA\n\nPeople have these heartwarming stories about meeting donors, but they aren't all hugs and kisses. Sometimes, like in your case, you did it to help others, but not to be attached to someone else's child. Sometimes children don't get that. What's worse is that his parents obviously didn't prepare him for this possibility. Further, your relatives should never have encouraged him right from the beginning. Contacting you once to see how you felt was fine, but once they knew, they tried to push their beliefs on you. That's not okay. I feel bad for the kid, but once you reiterated that you wanted to remain NC he went off the handle in an inappropriate way.", "NTA.\n\nI'd warn your second cousins to stop pushing as if you specifically chose to have a child and abandon him or they'll be losing contact with you too. Playing into this boy's fantasy is cruel and hurting him, not helping him.\n\nDonating sperm or eggs is about helping other people potentially become parents, not becoming one yourself, and is certainly not a guarantee that it will create a child. You did not 'choose' to have this kid, his parents CHOSE to use a sperm donation to create him. They chose to have him. He needs to go home to his actual family and sort out whatever is driving him to come to you.", "NTA. What has happened is a change in technology. When you donated, it WAS anonymous and you helped desperate people become parents. You never thought of this as becoming a \"parent\" or that things would one day change. I hope, since you have the boy's number, you will, in the kindest of ways, explain again what you wrote in this post.", "NTA\n\nYou donated sperm anonymously. The modern trend for recreational DNA matching has outed you as the bio father of this kid. You don't owe him anything, and he's the asshole for pushing it.", "NTA.  This isn\u2019t like you had sex and then ditched the mom.  This was a consensually anonymous transaction by you and the parents.  You have no obligation to this kid and I\u2019d say you you handled it quite well.", "NTA. If you explained in the first communication with him your stance on it, as sad as it may have made him, that\u2019s something he needs to come to terms with. He has a family that wants him.", "NTA\n\nYou donated anonymously and it should've stayed that way. Your second cousins helping him find you was disrespecting your privacy not to mention bringing a stranger to your place of residence. That poor boy may have a hard time processing this but it's better than you give him some false hope for a connection that doesn't exist. He's going to have to come to terms with this but I think you made the right choice to tell him the truth and how you feel. \n\nPS. I think it is worth blocking your second cousins they're the assholes in this entire story.", "NTA. You wanted to donate anonymously and did so, when everyone was anonymous. How could you have know you could've been tracked down years later? \n\nThis young man may have wanted to get to know his biological family, but he needed to learn that donors might not want that connection. It's a shame for him but he has to respect your decision on the matter, as does your cousin (who is acting like TA himself, for trying to force the issue).", "NTA. \n\nI'm not asking these questions to be mean, I genuinely want to know. How old is he? Some of the questions he asked like \"Why did you become a dad?\" and \"Why did you agree to have me?\" make me think he's really young or doesn't really understand what a sperm bank is (that's not what I mean but I don't know how to phrase it). \n\nYour second cousins are real a-holes for going to your job to introduce him to you and going to other family members to rally them against you. If they want a relationship with him, that's fine but they need to respect your wishes.", "Definitely not, your cousins are the assholes.  You and the kid are the victims of their assholishness", "NTA. You were nothing but honest about what you wanted a relationship with this kid to look like. You were firm in your boundaries, but it sounds like you were polite even when he was trying to bait you into saying things that would make him more angry because he\u2019s young and upset that this idea he had in his mind of a joyful reunion where y\u2019all had an instant connection is never going to be a reality. From your recounting, it seems possible that he might be having a hard time reconciling the difference between anonymous sperm donor and adopted at birth/any kind of situation where you would have parental rights to sign away. \u201cDo you regret me, do you regret giving me up?\u201d Not relevant. I feel kind of bad for him. \n\nIf anyone is the AH, it\u2019s your cousin who led the kid on instead of just letting it lie. Actually, I misspoke (mistyped?). The cousins are definitely AHs.", "NTA. You are exactly right - you were a sperm donor in a clinic, not helping friends have a baby or deserting this kid's mother. You were, before DNA testing, assured it was anonymous. Turns out that anonymity isn't guaranteed because of things like 23&me. You may need to have a discussion with a lawyer.", "NTA, but your second cousins are AHs who lied to you repeatedly.\n\nThis kid wouldn't have such emotional instability if he came from a \"good family\". He has daddy issues and we can probably guess why.", "I'm an adoptee. I was 47 before I got a message through to my mother. It took months to reach her, having been bounced through several distant relatives and ex-husbands. She could easily have declined to respond, and I'd have never known the difference. She told me how to find my father. I found his contact info, and sent him an email. Luckily, he was very welcoming, also. He flew across Canada to meet me, and welcomed me into his home to meet his family. We still correspond.\n\nBut the whole time, I was terrified of meeting the kind of reception you're giving off, and I would have backed off at the first hint that I was unwelcome. The last thing I'd want to do is to impose myself on someone who doesn't want to meet me.\n\nBut your kid doesn't care, and is being encouraged by the cousins to feel entitled. They're wrong.\n\nYou gave him life; your obligations end there. NTA. Give him all the medical info you have; that's fair. But you don't owe him a familial relationship.", "NTA go for a restraining order if he continues to bother you.", "NTA\n\nBut the family members involved sure as hell are. Where the fuck do they get off giving out your private information?!? Personally, I'd block each and every one of them and go NC. A real family member doesn't do that to someone they love. \n\nThe one thing I'd be doing beside that is to contact the court and get a \"no contact\" order and have the bio son served. He very clearly doesn't know how to take no for an answer. He needs to be forced to stop contacting you using legal means.", "How do you write your will to protect your kids? Do you specifically exclude any known/unknown children that were a result of a sperm sale/donation? Do you specifically exclude children who are not biologically related to specific women (legal spouses?).", "Your title is so misleading but your context backs you up. \n\nYou donated sperm and it was anonymous. You aren't a father and you don't have to have any responsibilities with that kid. Your cousins are being major AHs and I don't think they actually see the situation properly. \n\nNTA", " NTA / you are not his dad. you\u2019re just the guy who helped create him", "NTA I\u2019m not sure I would ever talk to your second cousins again. I think you need to go the legal route to make sure your sperm donor kid doesn\u2019t contact you. I would also update my will that any child from your sperm donations do not receive anything.", "NTA \n\nBut what\u2019s wrong with your cousins?", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't decide to have a kid and be a parent. You donated sperm knowing that it would allow *someone else* to have a kid and become a parent. Your second cousin was/is way out of line. This is absolutely none of their business and they need to stop trying to mediate contact between you two. \n\nI feel for the kid and it's obvious you do too, but you're not his dad. You're just the donor.", "Mannnn wit these DNA kits and no yelling how many people used ya swimmers, you probably gone get alot more of these situations.", "NTA.  They're harassing you.  Let them know you're considering legal options to stop them.", "NTA\nYou may be this kids father but you aren't his dad and he shouldn't keep pestering you. I feel for him, absolutely, but if he's got a family then he should step off. Hope things go okay op", "NTA.\n\nYou didn't \"agree to have him\" and you have no reason to \"feel anything\"... You donated your sperm in a cup so that someone who can't have children could conceive a child, you didn't bang his mom and abandon her during her pregnancy.\n\nYou didn't raise him and leave him in his childhood. You have 0 attachment to him or his family. Your cousins disrespected your boundaries.\n\nI get where the boys coming from, having been actively abandoned by my \"egg doner\" (my actual birth mom who doesn't deserve the title of mom), who also had many kids before and after me... Wondering what family I have out there... But if I did ever try to get in contact, if at any point any of them said no... Then that's that. No means no.\n\nNo is a full sentence.", "NTA and what the hell is wrong with your cousin?? This is absolutely appalling behavior. I can\u2019t even believe someone would do this. Outrageous. \n\nI\u2019m sure the kid was persistent but that doesn\u2019t excuse your cousin completely and repeatedly disregarding your wishes. Their behavior is psychotic.", "NTA\n\nI grew up without a father figure and I always wondered about him. I'm lucky that I had other relatives to rely on tho.\n\nI feel for the kid, but he should not push for a relationship with you", "NTA, I am an adoptee. You have the right to privacy.  I personally have no interest in meeting my bio parents.  Even if I did and they said no it would be the end of it.  Talk to a lawyer and get a restraining order against him.  You may want to seek a legal claim against the relative that gave out your information as well as bringing him to your home.", "You acted like the slap of life. Better it be about this than about not being able to walk after you're hit by a car, injured. Reality can be harsh. This kid has to learn to deal with it. He has parents - you ain't them.", "This is a crappy situation all the way around and absolutely something you could not have forseen when you donated. Never in a million years back in the 1990s and early 2000s did any of us think that DNA tests would become universally available AND that there would be a network like there is now through ancestry and other such websites.\n\nNAH. \n\nHe obviously is feeling an emptiness that he is trying to fill. Assuming he has good parents, you were right to turn him back towards them. And, you are well within your right to choose not to engage with him. That said, I think it would be wise to prepare yourself that there will likely be others that come forward in time. Come up with an elevator speech and an email with health information for your family. If your extended family want a relationship with him, that is their business. And, allow yourself space to process this. You might decide at the end of the day you want a limited relationship with him in the future.", "Nta. Whoever these cousins are that facilitated all this are though.", "NTA. Of course you expected anonymity - at the time you donated family DNA searches weren\u2019t an issue.  Your cousins are absolute assholes for encouraging the boy and bringing him to meet you when they should have been telling him you were not interested in meeting. They\u2019re also assholes for informing other members of your family.", "NTA, but your cousins are. If this kid is under the age of 18, I'm not understanding why his parents would encourage something like this. Did they not know he was wanting to meet you? \n\nThe kid sounds like he needs some therapy, but the responsibility lies with his actual parents to explain why they needed the assistance in having a baby. Your anonymous contribution was hand picked by HIS parents. You didn't \"choose\" to become a dad. \n\nWhat a strange interaction. I have so many questions. Lol", "NTA. You\u2019re a facilitator, not a parent.", "No man, NTA. Your family is though. I'd go non conduct personally, they breached your privacy. Not ok.", "NTA but your second cousins sure are. You made it clear from the beginning that you didn\u2019t want to be involved and wanted to remain anonymous. It\u2019s pretty disgusting of them to exploit this kid.

You are entitled to your privacy.", "NTA. Your cousins are.  The kid is not.  I suspect your family was pitching the you just have to meet him and he\u2019ll change or something along those lines.  I think you covered off your obligations of sharing medical history but beyond that you didn\u2019t chose to become a parent. And that kid needed to here that for whatever reason.  I think you handled it reasonably.", "NTA.

We don\u2019t know the full picture of his family to make him cling onto you as his dad but, for them to go to a clinic and get inseminated means that he was a child wanted by THEM, not you.

This is one of the instances on why blood doesn't mean family.", "NTA. You made your intentions clear from the beginning when you donated sperm under the understanding of anonymity. It's entirely your choice whether you want to establish a relationship with the biological child now. While it's understandable that he might be curious about his origins, it doesn't change the fact that your original agreement was based on anonymity. You're entitled to your feelings and boundaries, and it's unfortunate that the situation has escalated. Your decision should be respected, and it's important for your family to understand your perspective as well.", "Wow. This is the first post I have ever seen about a biological father not wanting to be in a kid's life in which I have to say NTA. You really caught me by surprise. Your cousins need to grow out of their soap opera phases. They're doing too much. You set a boundary, and it was disrespected. They are not the good guys in the situation. They gave that boy hope when you were very clear on your stance. \n\n>Then he shouted \"then why did you agree to have me\"\n\nYou didn't, though.

What a shitty situation for everyone involved.\n\nThe one thing I'd suggest is maybe back off on telling this kid how good he's had it because there's obviously an emptiness for him, along with a lack of understanding that your role in all if thus (sorry for bring crass) was just jerking off into a cup.\n\nIt brings me to wondering what stories his parents have been telling him.", "NTA I feel like there's something totally illegal about this tbh like if you signed a contract to stay anonymous.", "NTA - but I am of the opinion that donors shouldn\u2019t remain anonymous to people.

Good lord \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "What an out of pocket response.", "Wait\u2026what?\n\n\n\n\u2018They broke the rules, but you\u2019re the asshole\u2019\n\nThat\u2019s not how it works. He could actually sue the sperm bank AND his parents. Donors have the choice to be contacted. And since he didn\u2019t consent THEY are in the wrong. \n\nNo good deed goes unpunished. He literally gave a couple the gift of a child but somehow he\u2019s the bad guy?", "Honestly, I never wanted kids. Never. I think I am actually really excited, more terrified than when I saw a fin emerge from the water while surfing-level nervous, but really excited.", "NTA: It was a different time back then. When this DNA stuff came out, I was like, here we go! I have a brother, a nephew, and my son has a sister. Shit is crazy! Lol\n\n\nOP, I can tell you're excited for your future! I'm excited for you! Block everyone and enjoy this time with your fiance.", "and you weren't before? boy, is your partner a lucky lady to have you.", "Yeah I agree, but it happened. And although he should've have been contacted, do you really blame the kid for wanting to know his biological father? It's not OP's fault, but it happened and now the kid should be allowed to process that this is a sperm donor, not a father.", "No rulles were broken. The cousin had a dna test with ancestry.com. So did the young man. The young man found the cousin of OP om Ancestry.com who apparently told the young man who the OP was - nobody could predict that when OP was a sperm donor and the only one who was indiscrete was the cousin.", "What's your point, \"you weren't before\"? Weird passive agressive comment", "Wrong.\n\n\nThat may be how it happened, but the child WENT looking for HIM. His mothers know that the donor wanted to stay anonymous. It\u2019s listed on the donor profile before you even purchase the sperm. The sperm bank won\u2019t care. \n\n\u2018WE TOLD YOU NOT TO CONTACT HIM\u2019\n\n\nSo yes the rules were broken. They take this shit really seriously. They had one job- to keep him anonymous and they failed horribly at it. Now this poor man is dealing with the fallout of THEIR bad choices (not telling the son to stay away).", "It's not against the rules that he goes looking. He is not bound by any contract. The conpany is - and they didn't leak any information. This is not a legal matter."]}
