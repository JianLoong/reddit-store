Then I took up the carpet in the living room and refinished the floor.  It didn't match, so she bought enough LVT for the entire house.

Teach her to it right, and she's just ignoring? I know how to do all this stuff bc my dad took whole weekends to do things he could have done in a few hours so me and my siblings all learned how to take care of a home so WE WOULDN'T have to call a repairman. We can all lay tile (I remember him teaching us to cut tile to all fit with a special tile cutter...made a HUGE MESS with the water required to keep it cool), repair the HVAC, run a circuit, find issues in electrical, put on a roof, fix apliances, hang drywall, install outlets, replace toilets/garbage disposals/snake a drain/fix leaky faucets etc etc.  The only thing we (and he) does not fuck with is connecting things to a breaker box. He has a healthy respect for electricity and calls in an electrician for that, which is super cheap when all they have to do is connect something already run to the box. \n\nThe other aspect of this is, if she just bought a house, can she afford to hire people? Buying a home nowadays is hella expensive. So she is likely trying to save money bc she doesn't have the expendable income to hire people. \n\nTelling someone \"watch some YouTube videos\" is not the same as \"watch YouTube videos and then come over with a few pieces of extra tile and a piece of cardboard, show me what you can do!

With that said, he LOVES when we call him up for advice before we start a project bc he TAUGHT us from early on that he'd always be there to offer his advice.

Would you bother learning how to swim if you thought that there was some barrier that would prevent you from ever falling into the water or would you just think that you wouldn't ever have to learn? The best thing OP can do to teach her is to not fix it for her. Because she does have to learn how to do things on her own. Daddy won't always be there to fix her mess ups.
