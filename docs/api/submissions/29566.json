Then I took up the carpet in the living room and refinished the floor.  It didn't match, so she bought enough LVT for the entire house.

There is certainly less societal pressure to be responsible for yourself now.\n\nEdit: and just to be clear the millennial comment was not meant to be negative, I'm thankful for my peers being less motivated as it has made the job market much better for myself.

Almost everything I know in this area is from learning elsewhere. And they at least tried. \n\nPutting a lack of skill entirely on the daughter for not self teaching a skill that the dad couldn\u2019t be bothered with isn\u2019t entirely fair. \n\nIt certainly seems like the daughter can\u2019t actually afford to \u201cjust\u201d pay professionals.

I think the other poster was suggesting you help out in a supervisory role though, if that makes a difference. So you would sit there with several beers and tell her what to do, and you don't lift a finger. Stipulate that she has to do exactly what you say when you say it or you're out. She apparently doesn't realize how much work she's asking you to do, and that would certainly hammer it home! Totally up to you, though, it's very reasonable for that to also be more work than you want to take on. Either way is a great lesson for her in natural consequences.", "I don\u2019t blame Dad here.

Not all, but most learn this kind of behavior,  if she assumes you'll fix it,  it probably because you always have in the past.

Okay, dad walks her through it this time. Maybe she learns how to do this thing. But then there\u2019s always going to be something else because Daddy is still helping to pick up the pieces and he\u2019s going to perpetuate the expectation that he\u2019s going to walk her through every subsequent project.

A good mentor never says \"it's taking them forever to learn 'X', they should just quit\"\n\nRegardless, it seems like she's eager to master some home repairs, OP has the skill and know-how, I see no reason he couldn't have taught this to her before his body conked out.", "Which is completely understandable, you probably spent the last few years wasting a lot of weekends fixing her DIY projects. Stay strong, you told her no, it's on her to find a solution that doesn't involve you.
