How did he expect you to \"figure something out\" that led her to not getting what she was promised without being sad?\n\nNTA. Your brother can fix his own mess next time.", "NTA. He asks you to be the bad guy, and rather than show her dramatic photos showing the reality of some (true backyard breeders, you give her an honest answer. You didn't tell her gory details, but did tell the truth. I have a feeling she will be coming to you for years to come for the truth, and from my personal experiences, that is a precious experience.\n\nPersonally, I would have told her some age appropriate information regarding the millions of animals who end up in shelters without loving families to care for them, but you did the right thing. 100%", "Nta \n\nCan\u2019t coddle kids away from the realities in life.", "NTA, and you literally said the truth\u2026 did he want you to lie in some way?", "NTA. Your brother doesn't know how to be a parent, end of story. Beware of further ridiculous requests like this in the future.", "NTA - Why is he asking you to say no to \\*his\\* kid instead of, you know, being a parent?\n\nHe asked, you did it and what you said was true and a very important reason not to buy a pug. She\u2019ll be sad until she goes to the shelter and picks up her dog.", "NTA but it would have been easier if he\u2019d raised a moral objection to breeding in general. He could say something like \u201cthere\u2019s thousands of dogs in shelters hoping for lovely people like you to adopt them, why don\u2019t we go have a look at some of them first.\u201d  \n\nAlso maybe have him tell her that there are people that are trying to improve the breed standard and make pugs healthier. Maybe see if she\u2019d like to do some research and see how she can support those causes. She sounds very empathetic and it might improve her mood if she feels like she can do something to help.", "Nta you told her the truth. You could also talk to her about the benefits of adopting a dog and not going to a breeder. Much cheaper and saving a dogs life!", "NTA, your brother is, though. If he is too scared to have a conversation with his own daughter, then that's his problem. Tell him if he doesn't like the way you handled the discussion with his daughter, then instead of critizing you, he should step up and parent his own child \n\nAlso, there's nothing wrong with your explanation. It wasn't scary or graphic. Owning a brachycephalic breed has risks and super expensive to get the surgery to open their airways. I am personally against breeders that have made these breeds have shorter/flat faces to look more \"cute.\" It's gross. How do people like listening to their dog struggle to breathe and think it's \"cute\".", "NTA. But just get a rescue. Problem solved. That way you don't support the breeding of dogs that you don't approve of morally, and you save a dog who needs a home, and your niece gets the breed she actually wants. Plus the cost is significantly lower. My family has had pugs that, when well cared for, exercised and well fed, lived extremely fulfilling, healthy and long lives for their breed. Some of them were rescues. Some of the best dogs I've had.\n\nQuadruple win for everyone involved.", "Why didn't you just tell her the truth, that he meant pick any dog at the shelter. She's 8 and you could have told her in simple enough terms for her to understand that and then get to go pick out her dog. Now she's going to be going around thinking all pugs suffer terribly.

He should have been adult enough to have an honest discussion. He was too weak to handle it, and pawned it off on you. The audacity of him being upset is insane.", "NTA you did what he asked! You told her the truth.", "NTA. Your brother, however...Yeah, he's an a-hole for asking you to do that then blasting you for doing exactly what he asked. Sounds like he doesn't have great parenting/communication skills. Has he always been this weak of character?", "NTA\n\nYou told her the truth.", "NTA it\u2019s not like you lied", "NTA - while I don't think the breed should be put down, it definitely shouldn't be supported.", "NTA. It's sad but it's actually truth", "NTA. What you told her was the best thing. Telling her they're expensive or anything reason like that might not have changed her mind. You told her the truth and she took the dogs health into consideration. \nWhen we were going to get a dog we told our duaghter it would be a greyhound because they're one of the healthiest and that there were lots waiting for homes.", "You didn't say anything that's not true. If he still wants to raise a stink about it, ask him how he was going to pay the expensive vet bill when that pug's eye pops out of it's head? Or show him a pic of what pugs looked like a century ago compared to now.\n\nFor that matter, most so called pure breeds have significant health issues, especially later in life.

Also, pugs are just a fuckin handful, I've two and my Christ they're work... You did the right thing", "NTA.\n\nYou did a service to all the animals that humans have bred to the point of physical distress. She'll be a more thoughtful human. Tell bro he'll make her fragile and unable to deal with reality if he continues to shelter her in this odd way. She was able to make an informed, compassionate decision based on this new knowledge. You did a good thing. She'll remember who was honest with her as she grows up.", "No way, definitely NTA! \n\nYour brother dropped this mess in your lap but then doesn't like what you did. She may be sad right now but as soon as she gets a dog then all that sad & depressed will just be gone. \n\nI'm so glad that they are adopting from a shelter. They are the best and deserve love.

You literally just did what you were asked to, your brother has no right to be upset with you. Next time, tell him no and this incident is the reason why.\n\nAlso, as cute and friendly as most pugs are, the potential health issues are really hard to handle. Though, as much as adopting from a shelter or rescue is the best option, if he cannot afford the money for a breeder dog, does this mean he can't afford vet bills? If that's the case, they should not, under any circumstances get any pet until they have some savings for the new family member, because shit happens and vets can be more expensive than the fee from a breeder.", "NTA.\n\nI would never own a snub nosed dog, healthy mixed breeds only, but I'm also not a dog person so it would take a bunch of convincing just to consider it.", "NTA\n\nI am so confused he specifically asked you to come up with a legitimate reason why she can\u2019t have a pug. He specifically said it can\u2019t be that they are too expensive. She already looked up information enough to know they are small dogs so space in the home isn\u2019t an issue.  You can\u2019t make a claim they are vicious because she already had information to counter that.  The only thing you could safely tell her was the truth about their health.  If you did the other two she would realize you are lying and then know her dad was going back on the any dog promise.  \n\nPlus I want to point out that she very easily could find a pug at a shelter.  So all he had to do is explain that it\u2019s kinder to adopt dogs from a shelter and they may find a pug there. Problem solved.", "NTA.  He\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t tell her about the skin issues, the hip issues, the obesity issues, etc.", "NTA. You did what he asked, and he for mad at you? I'd tell your niece that you only told her those things because her daddy didn't want to get her a pug and watch the fallout xD", "NTA. Next time he needs a favor like that tell him to be a damn parent and handle the situation himself.", "NTA and you told her the truth!", "Also, what OP told is very important knowledge.\n\nNTA", "OP could have spun a nice story about how it's better to adopt, how getting a dog from a shelter saves a puppy, how mixed breeds are smarter\u2026\n\nbut you know what? the brother could also have done that. he was setting OP to be the bad aunt/uncle and OP delivered. \n\nso the brother can go suck\nand egg and do his own dirty work from now on", "Telling her that brachycephalic dogs experience are prone to certain health issues is not dishonest.", "NTA omg your brother sucks. Why are you responsible for everything?", "NTA and also brother could have said things like, 'they may not have pugs at the shelter' 'its more important to adopt shelter dogs as they need homes too'  Any number of things without disappointing his kiddo.  He just didnt want to be the bad guy.\n\nOP did what was asked and still got in trouble for it.  Dont ask me to do anything for you again.", "One time my uncle asked me and my sister (15 and 11 at the time) to convince our younger cousins to leave a playground.

My life, people are exhausting.

He made me a new person. \nHis happiness is evident. \n\nSo although some are prone to issues, it doesn\u2019t make them a bad breed to have and I would recommend everyone have a pug at some point in their life unless they hate joy and happiness.", "NTA, but he\u2019s a major asshole for not telling her that himself. Why are you letting him treat you like that?", "Nta you did the right thing personally I don\u2019t think anyone should buy a pug from a breeder my ex brother in law bought two silly man did zero research ended up with one getting put to sleep after thousands of pounds in vet bills treatments not working for breathing problems and a heart defect and one needed an eye removed \n\nYou saved that little girl a lot of heartache", "\u201cI don\u2019t want to make my kid sad \u2013 you do it.\u201d     \n\\*later\\*       \n\u201chey, you made my kid sad!\u201d\n\nNTA He can\u2019t not have his cake and not have someone else eat it, too", "NTA. The father should have explained the difference between a pure bred dog and mixed breeds. Also, I am going on to explain the need for unwanted dogs in need of homes. If she truly wanted a pug, they should have started a plan together (which teaches her about finances) to save funds for the pug. Might have taken a year or two to save the funds and another year or 2 to get the dog via a responsible breeder", "NTA You told the truth, they do get very unwell. He wanted you to say something he can't then change his mind. There are loads of dog breeds that would cost less. Labradors, retrievers, cavalier king Charles, Maltese, Shih tzu, Yorkshire terrier, corgi, newfoundland.", "Your brother asked you to parent his child because he was too afraid about how it would make him look if he patented himself?  Then he had the nerve to complain how you did it?  NTA", "Very much NTA, you\u2019re brother asked and you delivered - and on top of that you educated your niece on ethical/non-ethical breeds and physical attributes to these. \n\nI don\u2019t even really think that\u2019s what your brother\u2019s mad about - he\u2019s most likely just seeing his daughter upset and you as the immediate culprit and he\u2019s taking his frustrations out on you. It doesn\u2019t make it fair, but he could react like this no matter what you had said, if his daughter got upset like that. Talk together, maybe rectify the situation (as in cheer up your niece, if you care to) by educating her on breed characteristics, \u201cstart when they\u2019re young\u201d you know? \n\nHow small breeds often live longer than large breeds, how those with long bodies and short legs may suffer hip and spine problems, how those with short noses may suffer breathing issues, small skulls can cause problems with pressure around the eyes or brain, but also how certain breeds require a lot of training and can be really smart, how some are lazy little buggers that make perfect cuddle buddies, make it into a teachable moment and remind your niece/tell your brother to remind his daughter that it\u2019s good that she knows, she\u2019s right to sympathise with dogs that might have health issues, but that she has the power to ensure some lucky dog a king and happy life, if she learns and puts in a lot of time and work and also puts some thought into getting a \u201chealthy\u201d breed (of course there are never guarantees, but some dogs are just sturdy af haha). It\u2019s pretty necessary to know for ANYONE getting their first dog anyway, so she should start considering things and getting ready, instead of just \u201cgetting\u201d a dog", "NTA", "NTA at all!\n\nI'd bet most people who now own pugs or any brachycephalic breed didn't know this until after they got the dog.", "Also, it's okay for kids to feel sad, it's good they grow and he should be proud of the empathy she's showing for dogs. NTA, you made her a better person.", "He probably thought OP would cave and the the dog for the child, then when the health issues arose, he could blame OP.....I'm cynical so this was my first thought lol. OP, NTA, you did as you were asked and also told the truth.", "How is it a problem solved if the niece wanted a pug? It's highly likely that a rescue pug would have the same health issues. Maybe even more likely since there would be no information on the parentage or their health, so no way of knowing of the breeder prioritized health or not. At least with breeders you can check what health tests they've done and what the results were (and if answer is no health checks or bad results then move to another more ethical breeder).\n\nAnd a lot of times people might think that brachy breed dog is healthy when they're not. People might not recognize the problems because they're just \"a breed characteristic\". There is quite a bit of research on the health of brachy breeds and shorter the muzzle the likelier it is they have health issues. \nIn a study 2012 there was a study to find out if dog owners could recognize breathing problems in their dogs. And over half of the owners whose brachy breed dog exhibited clear signs of having breathing problems still reported that their dog had no such issues due to brachycephalia. Because \"it was just normal for the breed\".\n\nI'm not making any judgement or comment on your animals. They very well could have been the healthiest pugs with no issues. But I kinda think it is important to note that it is very unlikely to find a healthy brachy dog. Dogs just need long enough muzzles in order to breathe without problems. Or without needing special surgery to open their airways.", "Lol. Okay. Commented this on another post but my mom's adopted dogs, both mutts, one had allergies that ran several hundred a month, the other ate a corn cob and had to have intestinal surgery for 7k and then they got tangled again a couple years later for another 7k (allergies were discovered before my mom had pet insurance on her, but the 7k surgeries about 5k of it was covered by pet insurance) Also, my own little shelter Mutt actually had her eye pop out. Scared the Hell out of me. Luckily they were able to save it. Point being, mixed shelter mutts can and do have health issues too, and you should be prepared and able to pay for them", "Oh wow, I didn't think of that but it certainly fits. \"Fix my problem but I won't even ask for what I want, I just want you to guess\" seems to fit the brother's behavior here", "Why does a rescue pug with health issues not deserve to be rescued? And if the dad cannot pay for health issues in his dog, then he should not be getting one, period. My parents adopted from the shelter. One Mutt had allergies that ran a couple hundred a month. The other Mutt ate a corn cob out of the garbage and needed a 7k surgery on her intestines. Then they ended up getting tangled again, another 7k. My mom calls that her million dollar dog. And luckily did have pet insurance on her. But the allergy dog the allergies were a \"pre-existing condition\" so she had to pay hundreds a month out of pocket for years."]}
