I didn't really think she would actually throw a tantrum or anything like that but still agreed anyways, just in case.\n\nThat's why I told her that pugs often have narrow nostrils and windpipes that can make breathing difficult and are also more likely to have several other health issues like eye problems.

You did what he asked, *and* you told your niece the truth.", "Wait, he promised the kid any dog she wants, and can't live up to the promise, so asks you to fix it, and you tell her accurate facts about pugs, and now he's mad that she's sad? How did he expect you to \"figure something out\" that led her to not getting what she was promised without being sad?\n\nNTA. Your brother can fix his own mess next time.", "NTA. He asks you to be the bad guy, and rather than show her dramatic photos showing the reality of some (true backyard breeders, you give her an honest answer. You didn't tell her gory details, but did tell the truth. I have a feeling she will be coming to you for years to come for the truth, and from my personal experiences, that is a precious experience.\n\nPersonally, I would have told her some age appropriate information regarding the millions of animals who end up in shelters without loving families to care for them, but you did the right thing. 100%", "Nta \n\nCan\u2019t coddle kids away from the realities in life.", "NTA, and you literally said the truth\u2026 did he want you to lie in some way?", "NTA. Your brother doesn't know how to be a parent, end of story. Beware of further ridiculous requests like this in the future.", "NTA - Why is he asking you to say no to \\*his\\* kid instead of, you know, being a parent?\n\nHe asked, you did it and what you said was true and a very important reason not to buy a pug. She\u2019ll be sad until she goes to the shelter and picks up her dog.", "NTA but it would have been easier if he\u2019d raised a moral objection to breeding in general. He could say something like \u201cthere\u2019s thousands of dogs in shelters hoping for lovely people like you to adopt them, why don\u2019t we go have a look at some of them first.\u201d  \n\nAlso maybe have him tell her that there are people that are trying to improve the breed standard and make pugs healthier. Maybe see if she\u2019d like to do some research and see how she can support those causes. She sounds very empathetic and it might improve her mood if she feels like she can do something to help.", "Nta you told her the truth. You could also talk to her about the benefits of adopting a dog and not going to a breeder. Much cheaper and saving a dogs life!", "NTA, your brother is, though. If he is too scared to have a conversation with his own daughter, then that's his problem. Tell him if he doesn't like the way you handled the discussion with his daughter, then instead of critizing you, he should step up and parent his own child \n\nAlso, there's nothing wrong with your explanation. It wasn't scary or graphic. Owning a brachycephalic breed has risks and super expensive to get the surgery to open their airways. I am personally against breeders that have made these breeds have shorter/flat faces to look more \"cute.\" It's gross. How do people like listening to their dog struggle to breathe and think it's \"cute\".", "NTA. But just get a rescue. Problem solved. That way you don't support the breeding of dogs that you don't approve of morally, and you save a dog who needs a home, and your niece gets the breed she actually wants. Plus the cost is significantly lower. My family has had pugs that, when well cared for, exercised and well fed, lived extremely fulfilling, healthy and long lives for their breed. Some of them were rescues. Some of the best dogs I've had.\n\nQuadruple win for everyone involved.", "Why didn't you just tell her the truth, that he meant pick any dog at the shelter. She's 8 and you could have told her in simple enough terms for her to understand that and then get to go pick out her dog. Now she's going to be going around thinking all pugs suffer terribly. Honesty is always the best policy. ESH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

He should have been adult enough to have an honest discussion. He was too weak to handle it, and pawned it off on you. The audacity of him being upset is insane.", "NTA you did what he asked! You told her the truth.", "NTA. Your brother, however...Yeah, he's an a-hole for asking you to do that then blasting you for doing exactly what he asked. Sounds like he doesn't have great parenting/communication skills. Has he always been this weak of character?", "NTA\n\nYou told her the truth.", "NTA it\u2019s not like you lied", "NTA - while I don't think the breed should be put down, it definitely shouldn't be supported.", "NTA. It's sad but it's actually truth", "NTA. What you told her was the best thing. Telling her they're expensive or anything reason like that might not have changed her mind. You told her the truth and she took the dogs health into consideration. \nWhen we were going to get a dog we told our duaghter it would be a greyhound because they're one of the healthiest and that there were lots waiting for homes.", "You didn't say anything that's not true. If he still wants to raise a stink about it, ask him how he was going to pay the expensive vet bill when that pug's eye pops out of it's head? Or show him a pic of what pugs looked like a century ago compared to now.\n\nFor that matter, most so called pure breeds have significant health issues, especially later in life. Give me a healthy mixed shelter mutt any day. NTA", "NTA- you conveyed a message and dealt with the outburst... Your brother knew she'd be sad, and sounded like he expected it. Also, pugs are just a fuckin handful, I've two and my Christ they're work... You did the right thing", "NTA.\n\nYou did a service to all the animals that humans have bred to the point of physical distress. She'll be a more thoughtful human. Tell bro he'll make her fragile and unable to deal with reality if he continues to shelter her in this odd way. She was able to make an informed, compassionate decision based on this new knowledge. You did a good thing. She'll remember who was honest with her as she grows up.", "No way, definitely NTA! \n\nYour brother dropped this mess in your lap but then doesn't like what you did. She may be sad right now but as soon as she gets a dog then all that sad & depressed will just be gone. \n\nI'm so glad that they are adopting from a shelter. They are the best and deserve love. So many of them don't know what love and a kind touch even are. \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc36\ud83e\udd73", "NTA. You literally just did what you were asked to, your brother has no right to be upset with you. Next time, tell him no and this incident is the reason why.\n\nAlso, as cute and friendly as most pugs are, the potential health issues are really hard to handle. Though, as much as adopting from a shelter or rescue is the best option, if he cannot afford the money for a breeder dog, does this mean he can't afford vet bills? If that's the case, they should not, under any circumstances get any pet until they have some savings for the new family member, because shit happens and vets can be more expensive than the fee from a breeder.", "NTA.\n\nI would never own a snub nosed dog, healthy mixed breeds only, but I'm also not a dog person so it would take a bunch of convincing just to consider it.", "NTA\n\nI am so confused he specifically asked you to come up with a legitimate reason why she can\u2019t have a pug. He specifically said it can\u2019t be that they are too expensive. She already looked up information enough to know they are small dogs so space in the home isn\u2019t an issue.  You can\u2019t make a claim they are vicious because she already had information to counter that.  The only thing you could safely tell her was the truth about their health.  If you did the other two she would realize you are lying and then know her dad was going back on the any dog promise.  \n\nPlus I want to point out that she very easily could find a pug at a shelter.  So all he had to do is explain that it\u2019s kinder to adopt dogs from a shelter and they may find a pug there. Problem solved.", "NTA.  He\u2019s lucky you didn\u2019t tell her about the skin issues, the hip issues, the obesity issues, etc.", "NTA. You did what he asked, and he for mad at you? I'd tell your niece that you only told her those things because her daddy didn't want to get her a pug and watch the fallout xD", "NTA. Next time he needs a favor like that tell him to be a damn parent and handle the situation himself.", "NTA and you told her the truth!", "Also, what OP told is very important knowledge.\n\nNTA", "OP could have spun a nice story about how it's better to adopt, how getting a dog from a shelter saves a puppy, how mixed breeds are smarter\u2026\n\nbut you know what? the brother could also have done that. he was setting OP to be the bad aunt/uncle and OP delivered. \n\nso the brother can go suck\nand egg and do his own dirty work from now on", "Telling her that brachycephalic dogs experience are prone to certain health issues is not dishonest."]}
