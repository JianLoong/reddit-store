If someone doesn't like that restaurant's food for WHATEVER reason, they can STILL BE THERE FOR THEIR FAMILY member to HONOR and CELEBRATE their special day.

However, it's also important to consider Leah's feelings and her choice for her birthday celebration. You tried to find a compromise by offering to bring a vegan meal for Gabe, which was a considerate solution. \n\nWhile it's important to respect Gabe's beliefs, it's also important for her to understand that the family is making adjustments and compromises for her, and sometimes it's necessary for her to do the same for others, especially on special occasions like birthdays.

As a parent you kind of laid it out for her. I mean, you might not have been 100% objective about it but I think it was fair to point out the downside of not coming.\n\nOn the other hand, it depends on how you view eating meat. There are places I would not go no matter how much I loved the person.", "I won't happily go to places like that, they usually have dead animals on the walls. If it's super important like a wedding or something, I deal with it and just keep my eyes down. I totally get where she's coming from. I also refused back then(26 years vegetarian so it's been a while). I grew into being able to basically keep my eyes down to show someone my support. She may not ever get to that point, but I also wouldn't guilt trip her. It's a big deal to someone with this lifestyle. Maybe have a talk with her and validate her feelings. Then have a family talk and let everyone know that places like that are terrible for her to be at, and to please be ok if Gabe doesn't join, because it's but ethical to them as a person.", "\"So I was sincere, saying that she could commit one day to someone who loves her so much and is always willing to eat vegan things with her, but if that was her decision, Leah would be heartbroken if she didn't go and that I don't know if I could improve the situation tbh.\"\n\nI mean... you were emotionally blackmailing her.  \n\nSo YTA for that.\n\n(Even your post talks about how miserable everyone was on Gabe's birthday, which I find weird since there is a lot of really good vegan food, so perhaps you are some of the problem anyways, if you can't eat a single meal without meat - it's also weird you eat meat at every meal).\n\nIf Gabe has an ethical objection to steakhouses, then you either go without her or find a new way to celebrate birthdays so everyone is comfortable.  7 is young, but it is old enough to understand why some people want to eat vegan.", "INFO Why did everybody hate the vegan restaurant except for your husband?\n\nSounds like: we are meat eaters so if forced to have a meal without meat we are going to act like we were forced to eat grass.\n\nDo you feel proud of wrecking your vegan daughter's birthday to prove what an awesome carnivore you are?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s good to teach your kids to be compassionate and think about the people around them but you might\u2019ve made her feel too bad about not going.

If the restaurant didn\u2019t have any vegan options, I could understand why she wouldn\u2019t go, but she was able to eat a meal there with her family so I don\u2019t see why she couldn\u2019t set her feelings about steakhouse restaurants aside for her sister. I think you handled this appropriately, and it sounds like everyone has been supportive of Leah\u2019s dietary choices, so I think Leah is overreacting here.", "Nta she can get a salad at a steak house. B day person chooses.  That's it. She choose a resturant her siblings didn't enjoy but they sucked it up and went.", "NTA - you didn\u2019t make her eat non-vegan food you just expected her to suck up the ambience of a place she wasn\u2019t keen on for the sake of a loved one - just as they had already done for her. \n\nMaybe ask her if she actually believes in fairness and reciprocity or is she really the only one deserving of privileges respect and consideration - because that is what it sounds like.", "Stop celebrating birthdays at restaurants.

We are talking about the death of trillions of individuals, and insufferable life conditions for billions. \n\nI don\u2019t want to call you an AH because the rules that you\u2019re applying make sense: when someone extends a courtesy to you, you try to extend the same courtesy back. That\u2019s certainly not a bad thing for kids to learn. \n\nHowever to understand your older daughter better you must realize that veganism is not a preference, it\u2019s a moral position against a very violent reality. When you youngest daughter goes to a vegan restaurant she isn\u2019t experiencing any moral distress, she just didn\u2019t like anything she ordered. When your eldest goes to a steak house she is being asked to celebrate as the corpses of innocent victims are consumed around her. These are not equal courtesies or experiences, at least in the mind of your daughter. \n\nI know this seems extreme but if you ask your daughter I bet she\u2019d agree. It is akin to if one of you children for their birthday chose a hike in the woods, which the other did not enjoy. So when their birthday came around they chose a dogfight. You wouldn\u2019t ask that your child put aside their moral code because the other one went on a hike.\n\nThink that\u2019s extreme? Ok, but your daughter probably doesn\u2019t. Plus the cruelty that occurs because of a single dog fight is dwarfed by the cruelty that stocks a meat house for a night. And it\u2019s no less violent as again she watches their flesh be consumed. \n\nOverall NTA but you shouldn\u2019t ask her to but aside her moral objections in this way in the future. Right now I imagine your daughter feels as though an important part of her values is unseen or not taken seriously enough by her mother.", "NTA - This is parenting teaching self**less**ness. \n\nHer sister suffered through her birthday choice with a smile on her face.\n\nHer older sister can do the same.\n\nIts about the relationships anyway, not the food.", "They do!

I am sure it would be initially upsetting for the little one.    \n\nI would not at all be surprised if Gabe actually regretted not going and felt left out if she didn't go - and there would be her chance to learn the cost of deciding not to go.

I'm simply explaining the basis of their comment.\n\nThat being said, their comment was 100% correct.\n\nAlso, it isn't \"impossible\" to avoid the most problematic companies if you choose to do so. I say that as someone who hasn't purchased a Nestle associated product in years.\n\n>Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude \u2014 as far as is possible and practicable \u2014 all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals.\n\nYes. Which is why it's worth highlighting the ways their money might support animal cruelty. \n\nHow do you expect people to make an informed decision if they aren't aware? It's ridiculous to try and silence discussion just because it suggests more can be done.\n\n>Some people live in places where there are fewer choices. You do the best you can with what you've got, first by making the choice to not actively choose to support a product that came directly from an animal.\n\nCool, *and none of this undermines the importance of making an informed decision.* People can't assess the choices that are available without first understanding what those choices mean.\n\n>Of course I love supporting strictly vegan companies, but if enough people have to ask a server to ask a chef about meal adjustments or order three sides to accommodate them, maybe one day the establishment will offer a black bean burger.\n\nSo...basically the exact point I made in MY comment? The one where I noted the importance of supporting non-animal products in order to create demand? \n\nYeah. I know. I said that already.\n\n>It's not the same as ordering a steak that came from a cow that had it's throat slit. Somebody is holding that knife for you, and you're paying for them to do it.\n\nIt's adjacent, and pretending otherwise is silly.\n\nPeople generally don't want to give money to companies that behave in ways they find reprehensible, even if they support the product. It's why people boycott homophobic chains - it isn't because the company is selling homophobia, but because buying ANY of their product supports the company and what they stand for.\n\n>It absolutely DOES make an impact to avoid the animal products, because that's the entire point! It's about supply and demand. Why do you think these companies are carrying more vegan products to begin with? If not choosing the animal products is forcing them to come up with other options, that is changing the industry.\n\nNo shit. I said that already.\n\nBut it makes a MUCH bigger difference to avoid animal products AND THE COMPANIES THAT LOBBY FOR THEM whenever doing so is possible.\n\n>Veganism is an ethical choice about the animals. Anyone saying they're vegan for the environment is not vegan, they eat a plant-based diet.\n\nSo...you should be agreeing with the parent comment and with my explanation. If you care about animals, you should care about diverting money away from companies that advocate for harming animals *as well as* simply purchasing non-animal options.\n\nNews flash: vegans aren't weak-willed idiots to be protected.

But most of us don\u2019t live there. And that still seems to be an issue of availability more than the value of meat over plants.

If you can do better, you do. I can count on one finger the places I can go within a 3 hour radius of me that ONLY serve vegan products. And even still, what if one of the employees uses their money to buy chicken wings? Am I then, still supporting the problem? Yes, in arounabout way. But if you're buying your vegan food from a grocery store that also sells meat, you're doing the same thing. So, if you buy a vegan product from a manufacturer that sells non -vegan products, you're still doing as best as is possible for you. Maybe it's about availability or affordability. Vegans have to stick together and not be so critical of those trying to make an impact. My point is that every little choice matters. Educate where you can, of course! It's a process, and you learn as you go.\n\nYou implied that it didn't matter, that buying from these companies at all is giving the same financial support as eating meat. I'm saying there's way more to it than that. The fact that people are trying and have already chosen to educate themselves on the industry does open the door for these other discussions, and it's great to have them.
