If someone doesn't like that restaurant's food for WHATEVER reason, they can STILL BE THERE FOR THEIR FAMILY member to HONOR and CELEBRATE their special day.

It's understandable that Gabe is committed to her vegan lifestyle and may not feel comfortable in a steakhouse. However, it's also important to consider Leah's feelings and her choice for her birthday celebration. You tried to find a compromise by offering to bring a vegan meal for Gabe, which was a considerate solution. \n\nWhile it's important to respect Gabe's beliefs, it's also important for her to understand that the family is making adjustments and compromises for her, and sometimes it's necessary for her to do the same for others, especially on special occasions like birthdays.

As a parent you kind of laid it out for her. I mean, you might not have been 100% objective about it but I think it was fair to point out the downside of not coming.\n\nOn the other hand, it depends on how you view eating meat. There are places I would not go no matter how much I loved the person.", "I won't happily go to places like that, they usually have dead animals on the walls. If it's super important like a wedding or something, I deal with it and just keep my eyes down. I totally get where she's coming from. I also refused back then(26 years vegetarian so it's been a while). I grew into being able to basically keep my eyes down to show someone my support. She may not ever get to that point, but I also wouldn't guilt trip her. It's a big deal to someone with this lifestyle. Maybe have a talk with her and validate her feelings. Then have a family talk and let everyone know that places like that are terrible for her to be at, and to please be ok if Gabe doesn't join, because it's but ethical to them as a person.", "\"So I was sincere, saying that she could commit one day to someone who loves her so much and is always willing to eat vegan things with her, but if that was her decision, Leah would be heartbroken if she didn't go and that I don't know if I could improve the situation tbh.\"\n\nI mean... you were emotionally blackmailing her.  \n\nSo YTA for that.\n\n(Even your post talks about how miserable everyone was on Gabe's birthday, which I find weird since there is a lot of really good vegan food, so perhaps you are some of the problem anyways, if you can't eat a single meal without meat - it's also weird you eat meat at every meal).\n\nIf Gabe has an ethical objection to steakhouses, then you either go without her or find a new way to celebrate birthdays so everyone is comfortable.  7 is young, but it is old enough to understand why some people want to eat vegan.", "INFO Why did everybody hate the vegan restaurant except for your husband?\n\nSounds like: we are meat eaters so if forced to have a meal without meat we are going to act like we were forced to eat grass.\n\nDo you feel proud of wrecking your vegan daughter's birthday to prove what an awesome carnivore you are?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
