She told Mom how mean and abusive we were, said she was scared of her dad. (**Edit**: forgot this bit! Told mom that dad took her phone away so she could not call mom for help when she was being hit with a belt. She has never been hit or spanked by Dad) All because husband got the phone bill (this was before unlimited text and data), bill was over $600, and he took her phone away. No yelling, just took it off her charger and locked it up since she had been warned the previous few months. She pulled something very similar with her mom a year later when mom would not let her go to a concert- on a school night- but let her brother go to one on a long weekend.

If it\u2019s a cumulation of other things (school, friends,step mom, siblings, depression, a mish mash of things that causes her to lash out) therapy will at least provide support.

But there have been several abuse related bait posts lately. I think they're from the same person. The pattern is the same.", "I'm not making that claim without evidence. I'm not going to give away the obvious pattern between this post and the others that were proven bait.", "Even if there's a court order, if you have any reason to believe your child might be in direct harm, you're allowed to break the order in order to protect them.", "As a fifty-something gal, I really believe that it's internalized misogyny. I see it so often with mothers and daughters. My husband's ex-wife abused and mistreated her daughter while greatly favoring and enabling her son (they're not hubby's children) and her own mother did that with her and her brother.", "A lot? What\u2019s that based upon?", "Me four!", "Then petition the court for modification.  Safety of the child is paramount.", "Yes definitely! I agree.", "This this this!", "Yes exactly ! It could absolutely just be a tantrum , but I don\u2019t think she would act so erratic and pretty much beg to do ALL the chores in the house just to not go. It\u2019s better to have all the bases covered, no one ever wants to believe a family member could do something so horrible but it does happen. They are at the age they can choose rather or not to go over anyways I believe. She shouldn\u2019t force her", "So that dirty pig comment didn't stick out you at all, the fact that your child is crying in hysterics begging to not return didn't set off an alarms?", "please don't force her to go. EVEN IF NOTHING TERRIBLE IS HAPPENING at her father's place, she will know she can confide in you and trust you if you respect her on this. it's very important she feels safe to confide in you. and if you can afford it, therapy would be great", "Please mention that to the therapist!!! That\u2019s a red flag, too. Some abuse victims will try to process their abuse by reclaiming control in other areas of their lives. Some will develop eating disorders (control over food). Some will become obsessive over cleaning (control over their environment).\n\nSince you mention that it\u2019s an unexpected change to her behavior, mention it to her psych, too. They need to know that.", "Sounds like a cry for help. No kid who doesn't like chores will volunteer to do them all unless they want something. In this case she wants to stay away from her father, which at her age is quite concerning. If she were a teen who didn't get the same treatment as her brother (ex. Getting a new phone) she'd likely lash out and not want to go. But this seems more serious and you should take it as such. Let her stay home, show her its a safe place and she will open up to you.", "exactly!! you\u2019re almost there OP. pls get her help. is there another trusted adult you can get to help? like an aunt or cousin she\u2019s comfortable with? maybe she can open up to them. i know when i was younger i was more comfortable talking to another and not my mom. not necessarily because i was SCARED of my mom or felt i couldn\u2019t trust her but i was scared to hurt her. even if it is as \u2018small\u2019 as the phone pls get her help.", "If your daughter came to you bleeding with a broken arm, would you still question her?  This is beyond ridiculous and your seeming inability to take responsibility is maddening.", "Look OP. Everyone here is telling you there is a good chance or possibility that your daughter is being abused.  I'm just gonna tell you straight up: YOUR DAUGHTER IS BEING SEXUALLY ABUSED AT HER FATHER'S HOUSE. \n\nMight be him, might be a friend of the family, might be another relative. \n\n**DO SOMETHING, DO NOT TALK TO HER FATHER FIRST.**", "OP, you\u2019re spot on!!! I can\u2019t remember one time as a 10 year old that I would offer to do extra chores, MUCH LESS all the chores in the house???? For someone her age, that\u2019s a huge expression of how desperately she doesn\u2019t want to go to your ex\u2019s.", "Kids will promise to do chores, do their homework, take care of the pets, etc. to get what they want.  When it comes time for them to actually DO the chores, it's \"I'm tired.  Can you help me?  I'll do it later.  It looks clean to me.\"\n\nI shared custody with my ex, and I can tell you kids will play one parent against the other if you allow it. If you do decide to let her stay home, you need to make sure that she has the least amount of fun she's ever had in a weekend.\n\nAll that said, **if you have any inkling of abuse, then you need to go through CPS or the Friend of the Court in your state to get that evaluated.** By a therapist, child advocate, whatever.  Denying your ex his visitation, repeatedly, with no proof could lead to HIM getting full custody.", "She\u2019s been arguing from the beginning, great she\u2019s finally getting it but I still don\u2019t believe that she won\u2019t just send her next time", "And cps should probably still be called to investigate dad", "After two months...", "Yeah. I'm not divorced, but if I was and one of my kids was so upset coming to my house that they were crying and begging not to come, I wouldn't want them to come over until we figured out what was going on. The fact that the OP said dad \"go crazy\" if she didn't go over is also very concerning.", "Yes. My God, that about broke my heart. I have kids, and this rings alarm bells like nothing else. I cannot imagine a parent being so oblivious.", "She's still commenting so I'm leaning towards bait for sure.", "Sometimes they don't *want* to see it, because they're afraid of the implications.\n\nAfraid it makes them bad for not catching it sooner or preventing it, afraid of \"upsetting things,\" afraid they might have to do something about it.\n\nWhich is all just extremely selfish, but that doesn't mean it doesn't affect whatever passes for decision-making.", "Or that she doesn\u2019t want anything interfering with her weekend plans.", "A 10 year old freaking out about going to their other parents home and a baby crying when put on the floor really aren\u2019t comparable situations. Is it possible she\u2019s just mad she didn\u2019t get a new phone? Maybe. But it\u2019s also very possible something a lot worse is going on that she\u2019s too young to know how to verbalize.", "This is not at all comparable to a small child having tantrums. You not seeing any red flags for abuse as a parent is honestly really concerning. They should be glaringly obvious. \n\n- a sudden and extreme change in behaviour\n- not wanting to go somewhere very specific, or be with someone specific\n- being willing to do anything to not have to go to that place or be with that person\n- a consistent pattern of not wanting to go, rather than a one off occasion, or sporadic events between periods of normal behaviour\n- a 10 year old calling her father a \u2018dirty pig\u2019, which is a very specific insult that is clearly not about not getting a toy or being told off for something small", "3 girls very close to me were assaulted by their father/uncle. It wasn't until the oldest was not much older than Op's daughter, that the sexual abuse came to light. When her behavior started changing and she became reclusive from her father. \n\nIt isn't a break down in communication where she doesn't have the skills to talk about it. Very often it's coercion and threats from the assailant that prevent the child from speaking out. The \"you'll destroy this family, people will hate you, you'll never get to see ____ again\" that makes a child not talk. \n\nHaving a mother that dismisses her like this though, *REALLY* makes it worse.", "I have to agree, it seems like a cocktail of misogyny and jealousy. If I ever have a daughter I never want her to feel like she's not good enough for me.", "Just personal experience honestly. I'm a woman with a sister and a brother and my sister and I were always treated very differently than my brother. My brother could do no wrong in my mother's eyes, he still gets treated like a helpless baby at 23. If I ever stepped slightly out of line, though, my mom slammed down on me like the hand of God. Happened a lot with other mothers and daughters in my family too.", "Me five - how the frick did she miss that??", "Unfortunately she already talked to her ex and told him how she reacts to going to his house.", "Might be* that's a VERY serious allegation without hearing it from the horses mouth, I've had similar reactions to going to my dad's as a child and he only shouted at me the previous week. I had anger issues, she could too. \nOP shouldn't take the kid to her dad's, but her reasoning for acting like this doesn't have to be sexual in nature and imagine how crazy OP would look of the allegation was thrown out and proven to be wrong later? Would absolutely destroy both hers and her exes reputation."]}
