I'm not opposed to being set up, but Laura and I don't really know each other well and I'm not so socially outgoing that going out with just anyone is especially appealing.\u00a0\n\n\nI said I wasn\u2019t really sure, trying to politely decline. Laura says she was told I've been set up before, and her friend is great etc.\n\n\nI was doing the whole \u201ceh I don't know\u2026\u201d thing, trying to not be too brusque with a flat \u201cno\u201d and hoping she\u2019ll pick up on the obvious lack of interest and stop putting me in this uncomfortable situation. Instead, Laura says she at least wants to tell me about her friend (Kim, 30\u2019s), and starts giving a quick rundown of her attributes & interests, which were all indoor activities. Seeing a legitimate out, I tell Laura that Kim sounds nice but I\u2019m really more of an outdoorsy person and would prefer that in a potential partner.\n\n\nFor a little background, I have a piece of land and I foster rescue animals. This is dogs and cats mostly, but Ill take in fowl and even the occasional horse, sheep, goat, etc. I mention all of this because that is my ultimate life goal, to work in foster and rescue as much as I can, though it isn't my regular paying job. Additionally, I am a very outdoorsy person. I camp, mountain climb, scuba dive, etc. Even on days when foster care doesn't keep me busy, I spend as many daylight hours as I can outside, doing this or that.\n\n\nI point out this lack of shared interests and Laura responds that maybe Kim just needs to be given the chance to learn if she\u2019s an outdoor person and I could show her that side of things.\u00a0\n\n\nAt this point I probably should have just firmly said no, but Laura\u2019s argument struck me as odd, so I said that I think someone Kim\u2019s age has a pretty good idea of if they are an outdoorsy person or not. Laura then kind of hesitantly says no because Kim is in a wheelchair.\u00a0\n\n\nI tell Laura that I\u2019m sure Kim is great but if I was to find someone, it would have to be someone who is interested and able to be a part of the life I am living and trying to build, and it doesn\u2019t sound like Kim fits that.\n\n\nLaura said that I\u2019m a horrible person for not even considering meeting Kim because she's in a wheelchair and I responded by saying I wasn\u2019t particularly interested in meeting before I learned that fact. Laura called me some choice words and left.\n\n\nThe incident has made its way around my social circle and when asked, I have said that while I was not especially interested in being set up with Kim in the first place, her being in a wheelchair did cement that inclination. This isn't because I think she\u2019s a bad person, but our lives and interests are not compatible.\u00a0\n\n\nUltimately I have the support of my close friends, but I\u2019ve also had several people tell me I\u2019m an ableist POS and such.", "created_utc": 1668015203, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqplyu/aita_for_allegedly_being_ableist/", "score": 980, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I never assumed that, Laura listed off her interest in hobbies and none of them were based on outdoor activity. \n\nAdditionally, I do understand that folks in wheelchairs can do quite a bit with certain accommodations outdoors. However a lot of the things I have in mind involve mountain climbing, rock climbing, backpack campaign, etc. These are things that inherently aren't really accessible to folks in a wheelchair, and ultimately I really am only interested in finding someone who would like to do at least some of these activities with me.\n\nJust wanted to put those thoughts out there, word limit kind of forces you to cut down a lot sometimes", "NTA. I bet the people harassing you are getting an incomplete story from Laura. Explain simply: \"Laura wanted to set me up with someone. I said no. She then told me the person uses a wheelchair. My answer remained no.\"\n\nEdit: changed \"is in\" to \"uses\"", "NTA. You weren't interested *before* learning she's in a wheelchair. That information didn't change anything. The fact that you now know does not obligate you to give her a chance. Tbh it would be more insensitive to go on a date with someone you have nothing in common with just out of pity for them.", "NTA You were cornered by someone determined to set you up with a stranger to you. You expressed disinterest. Then they kept bullying you to agree to the set up. You had every right and reason not to agree to a date.\n\nYour so called friend seems delusional. Anyone calling you a jerk either is a jerk or are fine with taking people hostage to force relationships.", "NTA. You're not rejecting Kim because she uses a wheelchair - you're rejecting her because she doesn't share any of your interests. If Kim is in her 30s, she's had plenty of time to learn whether she likes the outdoors or not.\n\nSome of your favored activities (mountain climbing, hiking, probably scuba) are things that Kim just couldn't do with you, because you can't do them in a wheelchair. If Kim was an outdoorsy type person who fitted the rest of your life, but just wouldn't be able to do some things, then this might be fine, but it sounds like you have no interests in common at all.", "Although I think you should have been more firm with Laura from the start of the conversation (nothing wrong with a flat \"no\" when that's how you feel), NTA.  Nobody is required to date someone they're not interested in, period.", "NTA. I am wheelchair bound myself. I think you were being as tactful and polite as possible before it was revealed that Kim is in a wheelchair. You have your interest, passion and goals well established. They were communicated in advance. \n\nOn the flip side, I absolutely would not want to be set up with someone who was into physical activities that I couldn\u2019t participate in to the fullest.  It would require someone having to make a very significant sacrifice. My marriage ended over less sharp distinctions and someone\u2019s inability to accept one persons limitations on their life. It creates a divide that can\u2019t be crossed sometimes.", "NTA. You genuinely were not interested before learning this and weren\u2019t asking to be set up in the first place. If the friend who was setting you up doesn\u2019t even know you well, it\u2019s likely she had little else to base the recommendation on besides looks, anyways.", "NTA but Laura absolutely is.\n\nYou cannot force an interest or connection and it\u2019s not ableist to want a partner that complements your lifestyle.\n\nHer berating you and calling you things because you\u2019re not interested in someone is a major dick move and is the exact opposite of constructive.\n\nLike did she expect you to cave and just meet her anyway because she called you ableist?\n\nDoes she really think Kim wants to get sympathy dates from people who were emotionally blackmailed into meeting her?\n\nCut ties with her, nothing good will come from that association.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nLaura kept pushing until you gave her the truth that she didn\u2019t want to hear", "NTA. You are allowed to date whom you wish and to not date whom you wish for whatever reason you want. Are we to the point now where you must date certain people or get called names?", "NTA. Wanting to go hiking and scuba diving isn't ableist.", "NTA\n\n1. You were already not wanting to meet her regardless of her wheelchair. \n\n2. It\u2019s a valid point not wanting to date someone in a wheelchair, if that means you won\u2019t be able to live the life you desire for yourself.", "NTA. I honestly don't really see how that could be ableist. Like, you weren't making a blanket statement about her as a person. It sounds pretty reasonable to want to be with someone who shares a similar lifestyle as you.", "NTA.  Your co-worker is TA here.   You have a right to do with your life what you want.  It is not being \"ableist\" to want a partner who can be part of your life.\n\nI would tell your co-worker that you want her to never set you up again.  Her ideas of doing this are flawed.", "NTA your friend is the ableist. If you had met even against your wishes, she is setting her friend up for hurt.", "NTA, Laura is though.", "NTA. The only way this could go the other way was if Kim did share your interests, but then you turned her down because of the wheelchair.", "NTA. I think your friend was trying to find an out for her poor matchmaking and she was using you as an excuse. Not cool.", "NTA. Honestly, I\u2019m a bit confused by Laura\u2019s persistence in setting the two of you up, when you don\u2019t share any of the same interests. Did she give any reasons for why she thought you two would be a good match? \n\nJust FYI, many people in wheelchairs can absolutely do even more extreme outdoor activities like rock climbing, mountain climbing, etc, with the right amount of motivation, support, and equipment. My friend who is paraplegic from a spinal cord injury regularly beats me down double black runs on the ski hill. Assuming that this girl can\u2019t do those activities, or won\u2019t want to try, just because the primary interests named by her friend are indoors, perhaps demonstrates a slight deficit in creativity and open-mindedness in your approach to this specific situation. However, you are within your rights to decline a date with anybody, no matter what the reason, and nobody should be giving you a hard time for turning down the opportunity.", "Nta. This is ridiculous. You are not a bad person for not meeting someone that does not align with your lifestyle. You making fun of her or belittling her would be ableist. \n\nAsk her how she feels it's appropriate to fix up someone in a wheelchair with someone that likes ROCK CLIMBING of all things. Like \"hey do you want your friend to be stranded at the bottom of the hill while I climb? Should I just give up any hobbies she can't partake in? Or maybe should you set her up with someone that is actually compatible and has interest in being set up?\"", "NTA, at least you learned which people you don't need to keep in your life", "NTA. You weren't interested before, and nothing she said changed that, even before learning about the wheelchair. I hate when that card is played. Like should you go out with her and waste both of yalls time, just to be called an ableist anyway when it doesn't work out?", "NTA for sure. People here saying you're ableist are off-base. You just recognize that you aren't compatible with a person who doesn't have full use of their legs because they wouldn't be able to hike and mountain climb with you, and that's something you want in a partner. \n\nFor everyone who disagrees with me/thinks it's ableist to not want to date a person in a wheelchair consider this - what about people who want to have kids but don't want to adopt? Are they ableist or assholes if they decide an infertile person isn't compatible with them? Because that's just another health problem that limits what a person is able to do. And to be clear, im not saying people in wheelchairs are incapable of most things, but there are some, like climbing a mountain, that are almost certainly off the table. What about a person who loves playing videogames with their partners not wanting to date someone who lost their hands? Or a director and a blind person? A musician and a person who can't hear? Recognizing that certain differences can make a relationship incompatible is not ableism or discrimination against people with health issues. It's just recognizing that you want a partner who can share those activities.", "NTA. Laura was pushing you to agree to a set up while also trying to keep from you that her friend is in a wheelchair. She is the real asshole. She should have understood your many polite no's and backed down. But she pushed you and then added the wheelchair which really didn't change anything because it already was a no from you.\n\nShe's a terrible friend to her friend in a wheelchair too. Why would she want to set her up with someone she knows isn't a match with her. And trying to keep the wheelchair part from her possible date. She sets her friend up for a terrible date.", "NTA, you really aren\u2019t compatible with this girl. Bullshit on the ableist junk. You enjoy doing things that she isn\u2019t able to do. You didn\u2019t even want to date her before you learned about the wheelchair.", "nta", "NAH, in my opinion. You should have just been firm and said No, you're not interested before you ever got to the interests/wheelchair bit. Sounds like you left the door open a bit for her to keep trying (although I wouldn't personally have kept pressing, I think, and I think she probably shouldn't have either given the hesitation.)\n\nHowever, I think it is a bit shortsighted and ableist specifically to assume that someone in a wheelchair can't participate in and enjoy outdoorsy activities or that their lifestyle is inherently incompatible with yours solely on the basis of that. Completely reasonable however to assume that someone who doesn't already enjoy those activities isn't going to magically start enjoying them because you do.", "INFO: what would you do if you found yourself an outdoorsy partner but they got in an accident?", "ESH, she shouldn't have kept pushing when you clearly weren't interested, but it is ableist to refuse to date anyone who can't walk.", "ESH the fact that she\u2019s in a wheelchair \u2018cements\u2019 your decision makes your ableist. Also people in wheelchairs can also be outdoorsy if they want to when there\u2019s the right resources, so Laura\u2019s assumption that Kim cannot be outdoorsy is also ableist in itself.\n\nAlso frustrating that Kim didn\u2019t bother listening to you from the start, took that Kim\u2019s wheelchair impacted your decision and RAN with it", "ESH. Laura shouldn't have been pushing since you weren't interested. You should have been more direct about not wanting to be set up by her. Making it about the specific person was never going to turn out well.\n\nare you a bad person? not intrinsically. but if your attitude is that a feature of a person is a dealbreaker, then it is fair to say that you are discriminating against that feature.

And even if you did like her and it turned into a long term relationship, what would end up happening would be, she would start to resent that you go mountain climbing without her, or work with the animals instead of sitting inside with her, she'd get mad, and you'd feel forced to give up everything that makes you you, and then no one would be happy.

I believe it\u2019s fine not to date someone without having to justify your decision to the outside world. You couldn\u2019t judge Kim based on anything else because it would have been a blind date.
