She has only come once for our wedding, so we haven't seen her in years and wanted her to meet her grandkids (5 and 2) \n\nI really don't know her at all. My only interaction with her has been the wedding. She wanted to wear something cultural but I asked her not to wear white (traditional mother of the groom color in the Philippines) and she told people behind my back that I am a racist bitch and ugly. When confronted she just cried and said she was blowing off steam and accused me of racism.\n\nI've hardly spoken to her in my life, so that was my one impression of her. I know she was super anxious about coming alone, so I tried to be as welcoming as possible. MIL came and I thought things were ok, but then she began receiving all these deliveries of food and a family member drove an hour to bring her a casserole.\n\nI was confused and when I talked to the family member, she said MIL's husband had contacted her and claimed she was starving and he was ordering what groceries he could, but any food they could bring her would help. I was even more confused. We have food in the house and I cook every night.\n\nI talked to MIL she admitted she had been calling her husband crying because she was hungry. She said I didn't make her breakfast (didn't know I had to. I eat something quick before work) and didn't tell her she could eat our food or use our kitchen (again didn't know I had to) so she just hadn't been eating.\n\nI could feel my blood boiling and yelled why wouldn't you just ask. I said she humiliated me and should have come to me instead of running to her husband like a cry baby. She began sobbing. My husband came in and backed me, and MIL kept screaming for us to get out. I did but muttered it is our room.\n\nAll of her stuff is gone now. She must had left through a back door. She ignored our calls, so I sent a text, but now family from America and from back in the Philippines are calling us disrespectful assholes.

Before I married my husband, who is as WASP as WASP can be, he asked me SO many questions about my family that our engagement became an opportunity for me to learn more about my parents' culture and upbringing.  \n\n\nDon't get me wrong, your MIL sounds like a drama queen, but the white dress wedding incident - I understand where she's coming from.  She wanted to wear the Filipiniana terno dress - the dress with the high puffed sleeves made out of pineapple fiber?  My own mother wore that white dress during our wedding and believe me no one pulled out the smelling salts and exclaimed \"I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE WORE WHITE.\"  Everybody knew that we were all celebrating the merging of two families and our two cultures.  It seems to me that you just completely shut that down.  \n\n\nSo here's my judgment.  Your husband should have taken care to prep you AND her before the visit so you could come out in the best light.  You should have shown at least an iota of curiosity about the family you were marrying into.    You AND YOUR HUSBAND should have made it quite clear to your MIL that she could raid the fridge.

It's not more your fault because you're female.", "INFO (asking because I am truly naive about this): Could the MIL not have felt comfortable asking for food due a cultural attitude (ex: I'm the guest in this house, so it's rude to ask for things)?

Although OP mentioned she cooks every night, so it all just seems very weird.", "INFO: What efforts have you and your husband made to be hospitable to MIL?", "I\u2019m so confused. MIL lives in the Philippines, is presumably Filipino and your husband has never been there? Was she in your country or some other country, had kids then left? Does your husband know nothing about his culture? If you want your kids to know nothing about his culture or have nothing to do with his family don\u2019t do anything. I\u2019m kind of suspecting he wants nothing to do with being Filipino or you\u2019re super controlling and he\u2019s somewhat afraid of you.", "I do think it's an AH move to see that someone feels as though they aren't welcome to your food or aren't accepted in your home and for your first reaction to be to yell at them and berate them.

Maybe overall that's for the better.", "ESH. \n\nShe seems like a lot. \n\nHowever, it doesn't seem SHE did anything but vent to her husband, which is a fair thing to do.  She didn't ask someone to deliver food.  That was done for her.  And the fact that you lost it because you were \"humilated\" seems kind of extreme.   Calling her a crybaby for venting to her husband sucks", "ESH  sorry.   When cultures clash!  Your MIL sounds like a traditional Filipino with a culture far removed from yours.  You sound like a typical American who thinks the entire world runs (or should run) according to your way of doing things.   How sad that you couldn't sit down and talk things out.

What exactly have you all done to be hospitable, bond or spend time with her? Plus you got your blood boiling because she confided in her husband? She should have came to you, the stranger who did nothing to accommodate her in your home to complain? You were more concerned with the \"humiliation\" than with the fact that a misunderstanding caused this woman to go hungry in your home and ask help from someone in a different continent because you failed to make her see you as an good host. The initial misunderstanding doesn't make you an AH. Cultural differences can be hard to navigate but your response to it ia.

So here's my take on the situation.\n\nI'm giving you my opinion here as a Filipino immigrant to North America. \n\nWhat you define as being hospitable doesn't translate the same way culturally. As a guest, in a foreign country - having just arrived mind you - I and I am assuming your MIL as well would be extremely hesitant to touch anything that we do not have express permission to. Even then, as a guest, the thing that would be at the forefront of our minds would be to just to take a little bit so as to not be a burden.\n\nWe are not like you Americans who can just go into someone's home and start rummaging all over the place. Culturally, we are taught that such behaviour is shameless and entitled. The same goes for asking for stuff in somebody else's home. It takes a while to get to that level of trust\n\nThere is also the fact that even though Filipino's are known for being able to speak English, you have to understand that older generations will still have trouble doing so. I know my grandparents can't, and my parents struggled the first few years moving to Canada. Maybe she had the same problem, maybe she didn't.", "NTA. Your husband is Philippino too and he'd known to tell her she can eat whats in the fridge etc. This simply means, shes causing the drama on purpose.  There is clearly something wrong with her and it's not cultural thing (as he would be aware of that). So stop blaming yourself and stop listening to that family member who call u an a-hole.", "YTA. You're rude and you're a bully. I guess you're feeling pretty good about yourself for making your MIL cry and making her leave the house? I'm also guessing that when you tell this story, you leave out the part about never trying to find out abiut or understand the Filipino culture (in Asian culture we never help ourselves to anything in the litchen or use any facilities in a bost's house unless given express permission), not telling MIl to help herself to food, not having breakfast ready for her after she arrived after a 15 hour flight, not allowing her to wear a traditional mother of the groom outfit that was traditional in her and your husband's culture because you American self cannot tolerate anyone else wearing white at a wedding, yelling at her and calling her a cry baby, and making her so miserable she left. You're an unkind and self absorbed person, and it sickens me that you can't see that. And tour husband is just as bad.", "Both you and your husband are the assholes.
