I really like buying gifts for my siblings but since I\u2019ve been saving I decided not to buy gifts. That\u2019s until two weeks ago, my sisters 18th bday came up. I overheard her and mom talking about MichaelKors jewelry so I decided to buy it for her. Note, me and her aren\u2019t really close anymore, when we were kids, we were inseparable but now we pretty much ignore each other (mostly because no matter how hard I try, she keeps out conversations short so I gave up). I am closer to my 14 year old sister. Anyways I bought her the gift (set of necklace earrings and bracelet) I think it was around 250\u20ac and I was proud of myself for buying her that, because I knew she\u2019d like it. Her bday came up, we celebrated it at a restaurant and I gave her the gift. She looked happy with it so I was happy. However when we got home my mom asked me for the receipt, I asked why and she replied \u201cfor incase your sister wants to return it\u201d. I was kinda confused and hurt, it was my gift to her. But I brushed it off and gave her the receipt, it was hers now right? Fast forward to a week ago, I had an job interview at ICI PARIS, so I had to look presentable. I couldn\u2019t find anything in my closet since I hadn\u2019t bought myself anything nice recently (again I was saving money). So I took a blazer out of my sisters closet. I didn\u2019t ask for permission though, maybe dumb, but the job interview didn\u2019t take that long anyway. I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d care. Well, I was wrong. When I got home, my mom saw me wearing it and she didn\u2019t even ask me about the job interview, she straight up said \u201cwhy would you wear your sisters clothes, she\u2019s gonna be pissed\u201d. I thought how mad could she get?? It ain\u2019t that deep, we are siblings and we share stuff. Again, WRONG. My sister had heard my mom and came up to me, saying the most vile things I\u2019ve ever heard. It went from \u201cyou made it fucking stretch you pig\u201d to \u201cyou\u2019re the extra life we don\u2019t need in this house\u201d. I was on the verge of crying, instead I shoved it in her arms and yelled \u201ctell me how much this thing costs I\u2019ll pay you back\u201d. Same day, dinnertime she and mom talked about when they were returning the MK jewelry, I interrupted them and said give me the receipt, I\u2019ll bring it back myself. She didn\u2019t even care and said \u201cwhatever, didn\u2019t want anything from you anyway\u201d. My mom got pissed, said I was being a bitch and an asshole but I am not gonna spend money on someone who disrespects me like that, and definitely not on someone so spoiled and entitled. She clearly didn\u2019t appreciate the gift. So am I the asshole for wanting to return the gift I gave her?", "created_utc": 1686044073, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/142aakv/aita_for_returning_the_bday_gift_i_bought_for_my/", "score": 374, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you want to return it snd don\u2019t have the receipt you certainly reiterate how appreciative you are by saying something along the lines of \u201cthank you so much for the gift, it was so thoughtful and kind, I was thinking I might want to exchange it for xyz, is there any way you still have the receipt?\u201d\n\nIf she says \u201cwhatever I didn\u2019t want anything from you anyway\u201d then she doesn\u2019t deserve anything from you!", "NTA. The only thing you didn't do is ask permission to borrow the blazer. But they basically disrespect your bday present to your face and go on about returning it right at you? If I was to exchange a bday present, I'd do it without telling the person and let them know it really was the thought that counted to me (Sometimes people get me gifts that seem to be totally something I would love but I don't like them, and those are actually gifts I really appreciate because it shows the thought really did count - I've had other presents that were almost soulless and there was very little thought). Besides, you mentioned you're not close to your sister and didn't want to spend money, but you spent a small fortune on her birthday and apparently that's not good enough for her!", "NTA - Honestly, the fact that they said those vile things to you. It\u2019s unacceptable. Especially because 1. You worn a jacket (should have asked but it\u2019s a minor thing) and what your sister said afterwards but a huge overreaction. I\u2019ve had my brother worn my clothes before and stretched them (he works out so big muscles) but oh well. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t know about anyone else, if someone doesn\u2019t want a gift, I rather them give it to me so I can get my money back (and possibly get something better depends on how they asked and whatnot) instead of them returning it and getting the money (that in this situation the ungrateful sister doesn\u2019t deserve). \n\nHonestly, OP it\u2019s probably best when you move out to limit contact with your sister if she\u2019s just going to treat you like that.\n\nAlso how long has she and your mum treated you like that?", "NTA: they are toxic but what they say to u was pretty mess up, OP next time ask to borrow the jacket", "NTA, gets me thinking if they are actually your family. This is so rude and offensive. However, do make it a point to ask for permission before taking anything from anyone", "NTA - She made her feelings known about what she thinks of you and your gifts and your mother agrees with her. She's clearly the favourite child. \n\nUse that money towards your apartment and get out of there as soon as possible... They'll need you before you need them.\n\nBut stop wearing her clothes, especially without asking.", "NTA. Get out of there and don't look back. They're ungrateful and I'm appalled someone could say those things to a family member.", "NTA, your sister is being very rude towards you, and so was your mom for saying all that she did.

You dont borrow anything without permission.  In this day and age, you could have contacted her to ask, so that alone tells me there is more background to this than is letting on.\n\nAlso, for your sister to blow up like that and deliver a couple \"low blows\" that were really hurtful to her own sister.  This isnt like when you guys were 7 or 8, you just dont say shit like that to a sibling anywhere near your ages.

I am the only introvert in a home full of extroverted people, I have a hard time standing up for myself.

The only person I\u2019m close to is my young sister (14) I\u2019m so happy to have her in my life, I\u2019m probably gonna have a hard time if I move because I\u2019d miss her so much.", "Honestly if she hadn\u2019t said those things to me over a blazer, I probably would\u2019ve ignored the fact she wanted to return the gift, but I was so mad after that incident it just flooped out of my mouth.", "I love buying gifts for people because their reaction makes me so happy.

She has been distant from me since she started high school, but I thought she didn\u2019t find it cool to be friends with her sister and that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t really spoke to me anymore. I really don\u2019t know what it is. I tried fixing our relationship but she didn\u2019t put any effort into it.

You can talk with and see your younger sister all the time once you move out, but what you're describing isn't a bunch of fun extroverts joking around, it's extremely cruel, vicious attacks, name-calling, and being treated very badly indeed.  It might feel normal to you as you've grown up with this, but it's not normal.  It's terribly undermining.  Please take care of yourself and get yourself to a physical and emotional environment where you're not having to deal with this level of hostility.", "Definitely!

I wanted to add that yes, some of you are right about this behavior being deeply-rooted. My mom and sister are besties, they\u2019re so close, giggle about secrets, telling each other the latest gossips etc. Me feeling left out may be on me I don\u2019t know, I hate to think they\u2019re doing it on purpose so I really hope it\u2019s me lol. Throughout my childhood my mom has said pretty fucked up things so I wasn\u2019t really surprised at her behavior, but my sister never cussed me out or anything, she was kinda rude sometimes, keeping our conversation short and stuff. I hope to find a place of my own to escape them lol. By the way before ppl start asking, yes I am jealous of their relationship, and it feels very stupid but I also want to have a good relationship with them.", "Still horrible manners to say she's doing it to your face.

Or ask your mom if she has any insight? Although with the way they both act I wouldn't doubt if this went nowhere. Wish you luck", "Oh I\u2019ve tried that numerous times. Sometimes they\u2019ll giggle like highschoolers and when I ask \u201cwhat is it you\u2019re laughing at\u201d they either ignore me or just say it\u2019s nothing.
