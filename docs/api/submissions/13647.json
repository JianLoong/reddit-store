My dad was never a very good dad. He and my mom separated when I was young but never divorced, not sure why. He was crappy as a dad before the separation, crappy after the separation and crappy when my mom died three years ago. By crappy I mean he wasn't there. Didn't spend time with us, didn't show up for anything, didn't take care of us when we were sick, never knew anything about us, etc. While living in the same house there were times I didn't see him in two, three or even four months at all. About two years ago he met Sally, married her after six months, and she had her three kids under 10 moved into the house. Dad is so much more involved with Sally's kids than he ever was with me or my brother. My brother stopped talking to him after he saw how dad was with Sally's kids. I pulled way back too. I do my own thing and don't care to interact with dad or Sally or Sally's kids. Sally's kids think I'm the coolest person ever and they try very hard to hang out with me. Sally has tried to push her kids on me so many times. She told me I should embrace being a big sister now and embrace having a bigger family. I told her this isn't my family. This is just where I stay until I can move out and be with my family, my brother.\n\nSally must have told dad because he spoke to me after I said that to her. Then he spoke to me again and again and again. Then, after a few months of me just ignoring his attempts to talk, he asked why I was being such a brat and why I wasn't getting to know my family. I told him this was no family of mine. He was no dad to me or my brother. I told him he was a shitty fucking dad and did he really think we'd be happy he was being a better dad to kids not his own. He said they are his kids and they're my siblings now and I should embrace that. That pissed me off and I told him as much. I also corrected his calling them my siblings, because we're no siblings, and none of them will be in my life in a few months. He told me I should be glad he's trying to be a better dad to them and by being a better dad to them it will make him a better dad to my brother and I too. I laughed and called him pathetic and reminded him yet again he was a shitty fucking dad. Sally and her kids heard everything. The kids were upset that I said we weren't siblings. They were upset I was \"mean to their dad\". Sally thought I was being a spoiled little princess for judging my dad super harshly. She also thought I should be willing to give them a shot.\n\nThen they (dad and Sally) got my grandparents involved who decided to preach forgiveness and reconciliation to me. They implored me to make an effort to salvage things with dad now that he has grown. They also said calling my father pathetic and laughing at him is wrong.\n\nI feel like I'm living in another reality but gotta ask AITA?", "created_utc": 1680278814, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/127q7dx/aita_for_laughing_at_my_dad_and_telling_him_hes/", "score": 3641, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Has he actually changed his treatment of you and your brother and become a more attentive father to you, or is he still ignoring you and just lavishing attention on his new wife's children?  Because that doesn't constitute \"trying,\" that's him keeping up the same behavior towards you.  I have to laugh at him claiming that being a better dad to the step-kids will make him a better dad to you.  No, it won't.  If he hasn't changed his behavior towards you at all, he is not really being a better dad.  \n\nI would say, try to be nice to the step-kids, they are totally innocent in this.  Your feelings of not wanting to be a part of their family are valid, but the kids are not the ones at fault here.  You certainly don't have to accept them as siblings, no matter what Sally says.

Maybe. But if he'd really had a change of heart, one would expect that his first step would have been to try to repair his relationship with you and your brother.\n\nBut from what you wrote, it does not sound like any attempt at that has happened. That he's devoting all of his effort on the steps and letting his relationship with you continue to be non-existent.\n\nWhich is the real problem. No matter how much he's \"grown\" and changed towards others, he has not changed in his behavior towards you.\n\nHe and Sally and your grandparents all want to use the quality of his relationship towards the stepkids as a substitue for his lack of relationship with you.

So I had a similar situation with my family. I was so angry when I was young, and I threw a lot of things back in my dad's face. He was not a great dad. He was very selfish, not narcissistic, but very much \"be greatful\" \"I'm the best dad ever\" \"I clothed you, feed you\", etc. I think what changed our relationship was me moving out and away. He would call me semi regularly. He would gloss over a lot of what I threw back at him, but it was nice to talk to him without my stepmom butting in to defend him. What really helped was (1) me getting older and realizing I'm not a time-cop, (2) that person who hurt me doesn't exist anymore. My dad was young and broke when he had me, and then he grew up. I kept him at arms length until the pandemic. My dad was getting older, and seeing his own mortality really rocked him. Instead of getting defensive or changing the subject, he would say, \"You're right,\" \"I think about thay a lot actually,\" \"I don't remember that, but if it happened, I'm horrified to hear that it did.\" He cried with me as he heard my pain, which felt like the first time ever. That's what made us closer. It's not perfect, and you do have to pick your battles. I think what you want is for your dad to acknowledge he wronged you and give you an explanation, not excuses. From there, you can move on and either grow that relationship or decide it's not for you. But it has to be that one on one. Fuck whatever your stepmom says, this isn't her business for now.

How old was your dad when he became a father? I'm not trying to make you excuses for him, but mental and emotional maturity always has a lot to do with situations like this.\nI have mixed feelings about this. My mom and dad divorced when I was 14.\nBefore that my dad was a pretty standard dad. He worked a lot and he worked hard. He wasn't always around and it was around. It was often in a disciplinary role.\nAfter the split I did see him recording to the approved visitation, and there were times when I used him as a scapegoat to get what I wanted for my mom. \nMeaning that if me and my mom had a big fight I would say \"I want to live with Dad.\" And he would accept me but it was normally so crap really stupid. Then I would go back after a couple weeks a month.\nAnyway, I spent the majority of my adolescents and early adult life being really jaded when I came to my dad.\nHe was never around, he did not teach me all the how to be a man things that my friends were getting from their at home dads, such as how to shave or whatever, sure. He always pays child support and takes care of us financially, but he's not there as a person or role model or \"Dad\".\nI feel a lot of anger and resentment regarding how I viewed my relationship with him and how I thought he did me super dirty.\nIn my mid-20s I became a father and stepfather ,and he became a really good grandpa. He wasn't around all the time, I couldn't even say that he was around regularly, but when he was around it was phenomenal, he was great to the kids and he didn't just show up with gifts or money. He actually spent time with them and getting to know them and try to expand their horizons regarding life experiences.\nI also found out that he spent a very long time after the split and before I was a father becoming a better son to his parents.\nHe passed away prematurely due to alcoholism. I always knew that he was active and his community and his school, as he was an educator in the same school district for nearly half his life.\nI didn't know though how much of an impact he had on that community that he was in and the school community that he was in until his funeral.\nLiterally hundreds and hundreds of people and families and kids and adults where kids when he was part of their life came to his funeral, sent us cards, and showed respect for him in many different ways once the news of his passing got out.\nThere were awards and scholarships created in his name and memory. They were huge donations given to the charities that he made his school get involved in every year.\nI cannot even count the number of families that came up to me and told me how much of a difference he made in their lives and their children lives by making sure that they got a hold of every resource they needed when they were in turmoil, or just the little things he did to make everyday better.\nFor a while after all these realizations came to light I was conflicted.\nPart of me thought \"WTF is wrong with me and my sister that he couldn't be there for us like that, or spend that kind of time and energy on us.\"\nUltimately and rather quickly, I realized a couple things\nBetween going through and reading all of the cars that were received, and his personal papers and effects while handling his estate; I realized pretty quickly that a major reason that he was so involved and so empathetic, caring, and energetic and helping all these other kids and their families was because of the guilt and regret at missed opportunities that he felt he had with my sister and I.\nDo I wish that he could have been the person that he was to everybody else with my sister and I?\nOf course.\nDo I understand that he was so perfect to everybody else because he felt like he failed my sister and I and wanted to make up for it?\nOf course.\nI know, that over time, if he would have had more time, he would have gotten to that same point with my sister and I.\nHe was working on it, he was trying, and while he had been trying in his own ways since the divorce when I was 14, I didn't understand it or realize it until I was 33.\nSo, I can understand it's a teenager, as a 17-year-old, how somebody making great strides regarding their relationship with somebody else may not feel like it has anything to do with you.

But there is a part in this that you are missing completely.  Sally's kids looked up to you a lot, and at such young ages, it could really harm their sense of self by overhearing what you said.  When someone you idolize talks about you like that, it can be really damaging to the psyche at those young ages.  I highly recommend, at the bare minimum, apologizing to the kids.  Try to remember that they didn't choose this either, and they just wanted to get to know you.  Maybe by at least being there for them a little, if/when your dad goes back to his old ways, at least they'll have someone to talk to, who will understand.  Now, I am in no way condoning what your father did or didn't do/said, and you have every right to feel how you do.  You feel cheated, that it's unfair.  And you have every right to feel this way.  But I would also highly recommend you find some therapy so this doesn't bleed over/harm your other future relationships.  And understand your Grandparent's reactions are not really about forgiveness and such.  It is their way of trying to guilt you to do what they want, without regard to your feelings.  And until someone asks for your forgiveness, no one has a need to be given, and no forgiveness is to be given unless you choose to/are ready to give it.  And since you know how it feels... just think of it this way... doesn't it seem like you are continuing the cycle of pain and neglect by doing the same thing to Sally's kids, that your father did to you and your brother?  I'm not saying you have to be best buddies with them or call them your siblings, but just remember that those kids didn't choose this either.

His children never really saw me as a sibling and I got why. But he was able to take the new understanding of how to be a good person my mother brought out of him and forged a much more positive relationship with his blood children. It took time. And effort.

My dad was not the best dad when I was growing up. He was rarely around and when he was, he was either sleeping or watching sports. I was 15 when he moved across the country to be near his girlfriend and her kids. My brother and I spent the summer with him that first year and when we met the gf\u2019s kids, it was obvious that they had a relationship with my dad that I didn\u2019t. (These kids did not live with their mom, but saw her and my dad fairly often.). I was seriously pissed. Why did he not want to spend time with us? Why was I not good enough?\n\nMy story has a better ending than yours, though. Over that summer and over the next few years my dad put in the effort he never really had before. It turned out that the reason he was never around was that my mom refused to get a job, claiming she was physically incapable of holding down a job. (She has muscular dystrophy, but it was completely controlled 20+ years ago\u2014she just didn\u2019t want to work.) At the time he left, he was holding down 4 jobs because my mom also refused to send my brother and me to public school, so my dad had to afford Catholic school all on his own.  Once he was away from her toxicity, he was able to actually spend time with us. When we weren\u2019t with him, we spoke on the phone 2-3 times a week for at least half an hour, which was a lot more than what we had when he lived with us.\n\nI hope your dad eventually puts in the effort, but it doesn\u2019t sound like he will.
