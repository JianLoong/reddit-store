My dad was never a very good dad. He and my mom separated when I was young but never divorced, not sure why. He was crappy as a dad before the separation, crappy after the separation and crappy when my mom died three years ago. By crappy I mean he wasn't there. Didn't spend time with us, didn't show up for anything, didn't take care of us when we were sick, never knew anything about us, etc. While living in the same house there were times I didn't see him in two, three or even four months at all. About two years ago he met Sally, married her after six months, and she had her three kids under 10 moved into the house. Dad is so much more involved with Sally's kids than he ever was with me or my brother. My brother stopped talking to him after he saw how dad was with Sally's kids. I pulled way back too. I do my own thing and don't care to interact with dad or Sally or Sally's kids. Sally's kids think I'm the coolest person ever and they try very hard to hang out with me. Sally has tried to push her kids on me so many times. She told me I should embrace being a big sister now and embrace having a bigger family. I told her this isn't my family. This is just where I stay until I can move out and be with my family, my brother.\n\nSally must have told dad because he spoke to me after I said that to her. Then he spoke to me again and again and again. Then, after a few months of me just ignoring his attempts to talk, he asked why I was being such a brat and why I wasn't getting to know my family. I told him this was no family of mine. He was no dad to me or my brother. I told him he was a shitty fucking dad and did he really think we'd be happy he was being a better dad to kids not his own. He said they are his kids and they're my siblings now and I should embrace that. That pissed me off and I told him as much. I also corrected his calling them my siblings, because we're no siblings, and none of them will be in my life in a few months. He told me I should be glad he's trying to be a better dad to them and by being a better dad to them it will make him a better dad to my brother and I too. I laughed and called him pathetic and reminded him yet again he was a shitty fucking dad. Sally and her kids heard everything. The kids were upset that I said we weren't siblings. They were upset I was \"mean to their dad\". Sally thought I was being a spoiled little princess for judging my dad super harshly. She also thought I should be willing to give them a shot.\n\nThen they (dad and Sally) got my grandparents involved who decided to preach forgiveness and reconciliation to me. They implored me to make an effort to salvage things with dad now that he has grown. They also said calling my father pathetic and laughing at him is wrong.\n\nI feel like I'm living in another reality but gotta ask AITA?", "created_utc": 1680278814, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/127q7dx/aita_for_laughing_at_my_dad_and_telling_him_hes/", "score": 1710, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Has he actually changed his treatment of you and your brother and become a more attentive father to you, or is he still ignoring you and just lavishing attention on his new wife's children?  Because that doesn't constitute \"trying,\" that's him keeping up the same behavior towards you.  I have to laugh at him claiming that being a better dad to the step-kids will make him a better dad to you.  No, it won't.  If he hasn't changed his behavior towards you at all, he is not really being a better dad.  \n\nI would say, try to be nice to the step-kids, they are totally innocent in this.  Your feelings of not wanting to be a part of their family are valid, but the kids are not the ones at fault here.  You certainly don't have to accept them as siblings, no matter what Sally says.

Maybe. But if he'd really had a change of heart, one would expect that his first step would have been to try to repair his relationship with you and your brother.\n\nBut from what you wrote, it does not sound like any attempt at that has happened. That he's devoting all of his effort on the steps and letting his relationship with you continue to be non-existent.\n\nWhich is the real problem. No matter how much he's \"grown\" and changed towards others, he has not changed in his behavior towards you.\n\nHe and Sally and your grandparents all want to use the quality of his relationship towards the stepkids as a substitue for his lack of relationship with you.

As long as you're being civil to everyone as long as you live there and are doing your fair share of the chores, etc., that's all you owe them.", "No. A bad father shouldn\u2019t get praise for failing his children and then try to redeem himself by being good to his step children.", "I can't believe he said you should be happy he's trying to be a good dad to them because it'll make him be a better dad to you guys...how about the other way around because those aren't your kids, but you can try for them?", "NTA Sounds like dad wants a medal.", "The grandparents think you should forgive your dad? Forgiveness comes AFTER an apology, a real one that acknowledges and takes responsibility for the harm, and repair work. Real, hard, consistent repair work, which in this case would take years. Has your dad done even one little step? Nope. Therefore forgiveness cannot occur. NTA.", "Too little, too late. NTA. You can be better for someone else but that doesn't undo the damage that was done", "Nta - lol everyone is preaching reconciliation because they went to pretend \"aww he's better now! He won't be like that again!\" Spoiler: he will. In 20 years Sandy will be out, stepkids will hate him just as much.", "Oof, NTA. My relationship with my dad is very similar and I applaud you for setting emotional boundaries. Seeing your dad \u201cmove on,\u201d in a sense and have a \u201cdo over\u201d with a different family is really effing hard. I also applaud you for handling this, imo, appropriately at such a young age.", "One of the best sayings I've read on Reddit is:  \"If he wanted a different story, he should have looked a different life.\"\n\nThis applies here.  While it's great he's stepping up for Sally's kids, there a reckoning for his own.  That's that.  It's not on you to clean up.", "Maybe you should sit Sally down and tell him exactly the sort of father he was and say I just hope he doesn't get bored of her kids too", "NTA, I was in a similar situation and when I got older I reconnected with my dad, when he died and left them everything and me nothing I wish I never would have spoken to him, that opened new wombs for me, he didn't deserve my time", "NTA\n\nSo sorry to hear this happened to you. *Maybe* your Dad is trying to be a better person. He did talk to you about it. But -- that does not mean your feelings and your own experiences are not right and valid.\n\nI'm sure your grandparents mean well. What they said to you is probably how they were raised, and they most likely want to keep peace in this situation. Again - does not mean your feelings and your own experiences are not right and valid.\n\nIt was harsh for Sally's kids to hear what they heard. Their own experiences with your dad are obviously different. Perhaps one day they will understand - who knows? Doesn't matter. You are NTA.

I'd explain that it's not their fault and that you don't have anything against them personally but sadly they remind you of how much your dad wasn't there for you at all that and how it was clearly a choice and not something he was incapable of because he's clearly been a better dad for them. Your dad definitely hasn't been honest about who he is and downplaying the fact he neglected you guys  to the extent he did.", "Nta. Sally sure has a lot to say on things that aren't her place. Your dad just thinking that those kids are his just because is absurd & its disrespectful to those kids. He is nothing more than a step parent- he cant be a good dad if he cant comprehend that. But to think treating someone elses kids better than his own (& b4 he even tries to make amends) is ridiculous. If he was anywhere near even being half way decent parent, he would know that he needs to hear you & respect what you are saying & feeling. But treating other kids better than your own doesn't make those kids feel better, it hurts.", "NTA. Sally has no right to have an opinion. You and your brother know what you guys have gone through, and no one should tell you to want to do it or how to feel. And your grandparents preaching forgiveness? Fuck that. Is he trying to make up for lost time? You don't owe them anything. Stay focused and forgive when/if you are ready.", "NTA. You can't burn a bidge then act surprised when the bridge is gone.", "Nta, you are still a kid and he is being an awful dad. If you were an adult and he was making amends it might be different but that's not this.", "NTA, I agree with all that you said, why should you be happy for him to be a good father to other kids when he couldn't be one to his own. And your grandparents need to step the fuck off.\n\nOne thing you can do, which may or may not work, is ask your father to prove that he wants to make amends. Try to make him give up (to you and your brother) something that he truly values. All the money in his bank account, the house, or something monumental to get him to prove that he means to be a better father. Try the same on your grandparents, if they vouch for him so much then they can prove it by relinquishing his inheritance or something.\\\\\n\nHonestly I see very little chance of you siblings reconciling with him so you might as well try to get something from it.

You\u2019re being a terrible and vindictive child.\nEven if your dad was absent, the relationship is a two way street, and it seems that your dad is trying to be better, but you\u2019re being angry and vindictive. Despite the fact that they give you a place to stay and probably feed you and provide for you. \nBesides do you really know what your dad was going through? Why he was absent? Was he out on benders, or was he working? You don\u2019t know why your parents separated, yet your blaming your dad for things that maybe you aren\u2019t aware of. \nYou\u2019re definitely being an AH to the step siblings. You don\u2019t have to take it out on them.", "Fascinating how your grandparents have an opinion now but not when their son is a deadbeat. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your dad got what he deserved.", "NTA. But your dad, Sally, and grandparents are. I'd say to them that the kids are being treated the way you were growing up...and that it doesn't feel good does it. Karma is hitting him now.", "NTA. You deserve a good life with loving family. You probably understand this already, but you're unlikely to get it from your dad.\n\nI sincerely hope you have the opportunity to work through the crap your dad has done to you emotionally and become the best person you can be. Good luck!", "NTA\n\nI have two shitty parents (divorced).\nOne is a really nice guy, but a terrible parent. I tolerate him because he was equally terrible to all his kids and there was no intention to be bad at parenting- he just didn\u2019t get it.\n\nThe other parent plays favourites, judges, and must be the one in charge. She knows what she is doing. Because I expect more from her (I have seen she knows how to parent), I hate her more, even though she did do more kid raising than the other one.\n\nSo I get were you are coming from- it hurts all over again knowing that they choose to be terrible parents to you.", "NTA You're 17 yo. You may forgive him one day. But not today. \n\nBut at some point , for your own good, you will have to accept that he did his best at the time even if his best was not good enough. Parents fuck up. And when you do accept this (not forgive him, that's a whole different topic) when you go through that process, that will be the moment you will be free of that pain and that anger. \n\nDon't let his mistakes pull you down and needlessly hurt those kids.", "Definitely NTA, sit your dad and Sally down tell them straight up that you are only here because you have to be legally (I'm just assuming you're waiting until you turn 18 to leave/move), that he doesn't get to spend alll your life being a shit parent and then think all is forgiven because he's trying with \"HIS NEW KIDS\" that once you are older to move out you'll be doing so and going no contact so there is no need to try and change things now. No amino of guilt tripping, talks or manipulation can make you do anything if you have already decided to cut them out completely. He doesn't care about you, he only cares about making a good impression to his new family", "NTA. He didn't grow, though. He is just being a better dad now because if he isn't, his wife will leave.", "NTA. \n\nAlso, if your dad were trying to reconcile his life with you and your brother, that\u2019s one thing, but it\u2019s so disingenuous to treat you better because of the step children. It seems like a act.\n\nOne unpopular opinion though: forgiveness and trust are two different things. It is good to forgive him, but you don\u2019t have to trust him to be there for you (like a father should be).", "NTA. If it helps, you can take the extra emotionally mature route and tell him \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re working at being a better dad, for your new family\u2019s sake. Unfortunately, I\u2019m nearly an adult and navigated so much of my childhood without you because you weren\u2019t there. That was traumatic for me and forced me to grow up a lot quicker than I should have, and I\u2019m not interested in having a relationship with you moving forward.\u201d (Tweak to fit your preferences ofc) \n\nYou\u2019re not in the wrong to resent him, or to be angry and petty. But even taking the high route, you don\u2019t owe him anything. It can be a good thing for him to start being a good dad for himself and his new kids, AND it can be too little, too late to save his relationship with you. Those are not mutually exclusive things. Older & religious people LOVE to preach forgiveness and manipulate you into believing you owe people a part of yourself just because you\u2019re related, but you don\u2019t. My favorite response to the forgiveness preaching is either \u201cI don\u2019t forgive you, so I hope you can forgive yourself enough for the both of us\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m stepping away, so you can choose to forgive and forget that or not; it really makes no difference to me\u201d.", "NTA", "NTA.  Your feelings are entirely valid.  Good for you for standing up for yourself and your brother.  Your father and Sally are prime examples of the people in social settings that will question how come their children don\u2019t talk to them.

My father was never really involved and poofed for 10 years after the divorce. My mother, though there's an 8 year gap between my little sister and my brother, then they divorced. I don't know why, but as soon as the divorce finalized, my mother changed. Less than 2 years later, she was getting remarried while pregnant with my 2nd brother, then had my baby sister 2 years after that. The mom that used to go to all of our events and take 100 pictures now couldn't care less. She used to spend quality time with us; she was patient and kind and loving. Then, out of nowhere, she became petty and narcissistic and manipulative and trashy. \n\nSomehow, it got even worse when my stepdad left her. My younger siblings are now 15, 17, and 19, and they haven't called her mom in years. They call her by her name because she wasn't a MOM to them she was just an adult who happened to live with them.\n\n\nStory just to give you a peak of her personality-\nShe told me that my stepdad had been sleeping on the couch for weeks and she was worried he was going to leave her. So she asked me to try and get a bunch of good pictures of them dressed up together. She asked this ON MY WEDDING DAY while getting ready to walk down the aisle. It gets worse!
