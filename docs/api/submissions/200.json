Halloween is the only holiday I really celebrate this time of year, as I despise Christmas, so to have it cut short when I was looking forward to it really sucks. He got to enjoy it in a way, but his whole arguement for me being upset was that it wasn't his fault that this happened and that it was my fault that I didn't want to go. His arguement was that he had asked me out before, but I don't remember the question even being asked of me. I remember saying I might have work and am in a pinch for money, but as far as I'm concerned no one asked me if I would like to go somewhere for halloween instead of on a night out. I didn't even get to enjoy the time i took off work...\n\nTldr: aita for being upset and partially blaming my friend for not understanding my feelings about my favourite event in the year being cut short while he got to enjoy a part of it?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

How does that work? And what is the difference between Halloween and a night out?", "That was in a different conversation, only this week did I tell him that. He said he'd asked me weeks ago about it and I wasn't in a pinch back then.", "He's an introvert too.", "Apparently they had already bought tickets so found it unnecessary to extend an invite, and I would've paid for them even if they were double the price just so I could enjoy it with him.", "Thank you, i can see where i am the asshole if yknow what i mean? I did display a high level of emotional distress he shouldnt have to deal with but I just wanted him to understand that I was allowed to be upset without him calling me immature...", "Usually we go out drinking for halloween, but going somewhere different would've been an alternative since we didn't plan on drinking tonight. He is more introvertes than I, so he rarely works up the courage to go to bars or clubs as he is autistic too. The conversation about going somewhere else and the money issues happened on two different occasions, but he blended the reasoning as to why i said no then to what i told him this week, and I said i do not think my memory is that bad, it happens where i forget simple things like where i put something but i did not at all recall that conversation or invitation; he said we were talking in my room after work, and chances are I might have blanked the conversation as the idle chatter we often have, as things more important like hanging out we discuss and make sure the other is aware and taking it in, very seriously.", "Yeah, but they're out doing their own thing. \n\nLiterally your post reads like you're pissed off someone went and had a good time without you.\n\nDo you understand how ridiculous that is ?", "You are being immature.", "Imo if he was your friend he\u2019d try reason with you instead of just blowing you off, you both have valid points but I get how you feel with wanting to be heard out considering this meant alot to you. I don\u2019t know if you have many friends but if you don\u2019t then I also double sympathise for you because I know that\u2019s it\u2019s not easy being left out then wanting to spend time with someone when you don\u2019t have anyone else ect, although it may be labelled as \u201cimmature\u201d it\u2019s still valid to hear out imo", "Wasn't upset he left me behind, was just upset he wasn't considering how disappointed I was. Wasn't blaming him for getting sick, the arguement only developed because he made it seem like I had memory problems. He can have a good time, I don't mind that, but he genuinely hates being out of the house more than me so to spend some time out tonight together meant a lot. I'm far from home and other friends studying, so it helps to have him and have fun with someone who knows me yknow?", "Lord do you sound needy, self centered and entitled.", "You have your opinion then", "It's not an opinion, it's a conclusion based on your whining.", "Your post has been removed. \n\n#Do not repost this without contacting the mods for approval, including edited versions.
