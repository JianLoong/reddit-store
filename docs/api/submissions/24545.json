Emma didn't have to attend. So it makes it 10 times worse that she attended and chose to make a scene at your wedding.  She is an adult who made bad choices. That's not on you.

Sometimes it's about venue size, budget, not wanting kids there, not wanting people you don't know there, etc. \n\nBut you're right, people can just decline to attend. It seems Emma wanted to make a public spectacle about her own principles.", "Don't listen to them.", "Like *five times a day* on Reddit somebody is posting because either they were on the issuing or receiving end of a child free invitation and people are hurt. And instead of enjoying their married lives, the bride and groom are dealing with the aftermath on their honeymoon.\n\nIn most all these child free wedding situations ( that fill the Reddit and Dear Abby columns precisely because the child free thing doesn\u2019t go well and sets off grenades in the extended family), It makes the hosts looks tacky and mean, and the guests look tacky and overstepping. No matter how you slice and dice it,  people look bad and relationships are cooled afterwards whether the guests a) do the noble thing and just accept the slap in the face and decline/step away from the situation/relationship or b) if they do the inappropriate vindictive thing and come but make a scene. Ick and ick . Which brings me back to the question of why in the world hosts would want to use their wedding (a day where a family is being made, where you hope the bride and groom will look beautiful and gracious, where you hope the guests will be happy to support them) as a day to play these hurtful games?? For the record, I do think that E did was wrong and she should have had the maturity to decline the stupid wedding. And yes,  OP looks like a pretty ugly bride calling her half-sister a bitch coming out of this \u201chappiest day over\u201d aka fiasco.\n\nThe child free weddings have become a whole phenomena and Reddit genre, and it\u2019s ALL very juvenile"]}
