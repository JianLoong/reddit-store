We've seen too many stories where the \"son\" (you) sides with the mom over their partner and it's refreshing to see someone actually doing the right thing here.\n\nSecond, time to get a doorbell camera and possibly even cameras for other angles of your property. This won't stop with a simple spraying from a sprinkler and you're going to want proof.\n\nThird, time to start documenting EVERYTHING she does. Get a journal / notebook. Get one for your wife as well. Write down everything about this incident that you remember. Screenshot the messages you receive. Save voicemails they leave. Your wife should write down everything and save everything she gets too. Why? Because of this...\n\n>Proceeds to yap about her rights to her grandchild\n\nGrandparent rights, if she does go the legal route, can be very troublesome depending on where you live. You'll want to look into them and have as much documentation to support keeping your mom away from your family as possible.\n\nGood luck. This is not a fun place to be but so far, you're handling it just fine.", "NTA. Who the fuck shows up in the middle of the night demanding to see a baby? Like seriously you are going to wake your child because mother dearest needs to feel relevant? Piss off. She\u2019s lucky it was just water and sprinklers. Good on you for standing up for your wife, you did the right thing.", "NTA x 1000. The cruelty of your mother\u2019s comments absolutely deserved immediate retribution. And for her to have the nerve to show up in the middle of the night, that is trespassing, and it was the right thing to continue to defend them.\n\nThat said, has your mother always been a crazy person? Vindictive, rude, given indications that she was obsessed with your children, or hated your wife? I can only imagine the answer is no since you moved her in. That said, to go from cruel comments to continual harassment, to the point that you\u2019ve been considering a restraining order, in four months, I feel like she has a serious psychotic problem. I could be wrong and it\u2019s by no means your responsibility, but if you had a loving relationship with her growing up and had wanted that for your wife and baby, I would confront her about getting some help. \n\nOtherwise, I concur a restraining order is the right way to go, and as others have said, information is powerful. Write down everything.", "Your job for the next 18 years is to protect your child: In this case, from your relatives. Good luck.", "YTA for not filming this so we can all laugh at her.", "NTA... If she's still blowing up your phone & banging on your door in the middle of the night demanding to see your grandchild, then you should definitely pursue a higher authority to help her understand that no means no.  So sad that we have to do that.", "NTA! Oh dear god! Keep your awful mom away from your wife and child. See if there\u2019s any legal protections you can take. Very happy that your wife is improving and feeling better.", "NTA. No mom, especially a new mom, should be shamed for how their birth went (c-sec or not) or how they feed their baby. Of course baby is important but so is caring for themselves. Your mom needs an intervention on her behavior.", "NTA\n\nI think Redditors are way to quick to recommend low/no contact but this situation certainly warrants low contact. Your mother inflicted abuse on your wife. That is alarming. \n\nYour mother is very sick. Only a sick, disturbed person would tell a mother that a c-section means she didn\u2019t give birth. Only a sick, disturbed person would say a new mother isn\u2019t a \u201creal mom\u201d because that new mom has to use formula or supplement with formula. These two instances alone show that your mother is a very sick, disturbed, and possibly dangerous person. She made a choice to be cruel and hurtful with words towards your wife. Your mother needs a mental health evaluation and serious treatment. \n\nA restraining order may very well be in order. While I don\u2019t believe in depriving grandparents access to their grandchildren, I also believe that protecting children from abusive people \nis a priority. Be wary when someone starts shitting the phrase \u201cgrandparents\u2019 rights\u201d out of their mouth.", "NTA\n\nHi, I am a first time parent currently (F5m) and it was not an AH move.  You provided warnings, and she did not listen.  Your family should question why she was at the house in the middle of the night.\n\nFurther to this, there is no such thing as \u2018Grandparent\u2019s rights\u2019 to see the baby.\n\nI hope that you, your wife, and child are doing better.", "NTA. Thank you for sticking up for your wife!!", "NTA - Get the restraining order!", "Yeah, you're an ass - a badass using the means at his disposal to defend his wife. The sprinkler hitting the door almost sounds too perfect, like a set-up on TV or something. Don't get that fixed too quickly \ud83d\ude2c But like others have said, create that paper trail of mom's awful behavior. Depending on exactly what kind of person she is, this could get much worse before it gets better. (NTA, BTW)", "How refreshing to see a son protect his wife and child from his psycho mom! Well done! \n\nReiterating the need for documentation, restraining order, and lawyer (grandparent rights are real depending on where you live.) \n\nCall the police every time she shows up. Every time.\n\nOops ETA. NTA obviously!", "NTA. If your mother is upset by any of this please tell her that she needs to grow thicker skin. She accused you of being dramatic yet contacted family members to stir up trouble. You and your wife need to be left in peace.", "NTA\n\nAnd holy crap yikes on spikes but your mom is crazy!! \n\nYour dad and siblings are TA along with your mom for being enablers as well.", "NTA: She is basically harassing you and no, she does not have a right to your child just because she is blood related. You already know how messed up it is for her to tell your SO that she is being whiney when she had a C-section instead of a natural birth, which in my opinion, is worse than natural (both of mine were vaginal but I\u2019ve heard horror stories about C-sections and have watched my friends/family struggle after.) shaming her for not using breast milk when a lot of mothers don\u2019t. All of this is never acceptable, especially when your SO is dealing with PPD and struggling with her ED and is making steps towards recovery. I\u2019m so glad that you are helping her in that and keeping all the negativity away.
