Your mother inflicted abuse on your wife. That is alarming. \n\nYour mother is very sick. Only a sick, disturbed person would tell a mother that a c-section means she didn\u2019t give birth. Only a sick, disturbed person would say a new mother isn\u2019t a \u201creal mom\u201d because that new mom has to use formula or supplement with formula. These two instances alone show that your mother is a very sick, disturbed, and possibly dangerous person. She made a choice to be cruel and hurtful with words towards your wife. Your mother needs a mental health evaluation and serious treatment. \n\nA restraining order may very well be in order.

I\u2019m currently pregnant now and neither set of grandparents live in our state, but we are both anticipating some push back from my in laws in regards to them forcing their way through into our lives despite us being low contact and concerned for our child\u2019s well-being. Most of what I find online refers to grandparents visitation due to custody battles or divorce, but that\u2019s not our situation as we are married.", "Good point. I have to look further into grandparents rights, but I can certainly see insane mom calling CPS and making OP's family's lives absolute hell.", "Trust me I know. My grandma on my paternal side tried that shit with my mom when I was a baby. Paternal grandma got an attorney so my mom got her mom involved and grandma got her own attorney and wrote a letter through the attorney to the paternal grandma and everything was dropped.", "Exactly this! She\u2019ll say do verbally abusive shit to the kids as they grow.  Sounds like you have Dark Triad parent (Narcissist, Psychopathic, Machiavellian).  I had one.  AWFUL!  I cut him out of our lives completely 10 years ago and we are so much better for it! No regrets!!", "It looks like they can\u2019t get visitation if you and your SO are still living together along with your child.\n\nhttps://www.divorcenet.com/states/georgia/grandparents_rights-faq", "Most states slip in language that allows grandparents to get their own separate visitation if the family is not \"intact.\" In most states, this is not just referring to death or termination of parental rights or a parent in prison long-term or parents who are unfit. It includes parents who were never married, divorced, or even just separated.\n\nOthers add clauses for even when an intact family (married parents & kids) lived with a grandparent or when a grandparent provided substantial support or when a grandparent had a substantial caregiver relationship.\n\nSome are definitely more strict. Due to a SCOTUS ruling, WA State effectively has no grandparents rights outside of an action declaring the parents or parent unfit. The wishes of the parent(s) take the highest regard. This was ruled on a situation where a parent had unalived themselves and grandparents previously had a significant relationship which the remaining parent decided to terminate. SCOTUS ruled in a way that effectively said the parent's wishes in this situation took the highest priority even with significant prior relationships.\n\nKentucky is the most grandparent-friendly IIRC. But, Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Montana, New Jersey all have laws that allow grandparent visitation while the family is intact. Maybe more, but most had wordings as mentioned above.\n\nTechnically, the SCOTUS ruling for WA State should have more impact. But, cases don't seem to be making it that far in other states to help ensure that Troxel vs Granville is taken into account.\n\nThis is strictly research, some case reports, and is not intended to act as legal advice to any specific person or case.", "Please see my nested comment above. It is not universally upheld at this point. And, I have seen recent court orders that do not adhere to Troxel.", "Yeah grandparent rights don\u2019t come into play until the event of a separation or custody dispute. They\u2019re totally irrelevant in this case, OP\u2019s mom is spewing BS - BUT OP and wife need to be documenting and recording all interactions with mom - if she truly flies off the handle, I could see this going the direction of her asserting that the parents are unfit and or neglectful, which *could* then involve grandparent rights. Documentation will help prevent and pre-empt that.", "This is a bot, original comment is from u/LadyJekyll"]}
