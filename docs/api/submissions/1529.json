Your mother inflicted abuse on your wife. That is alarming. \n\nYour mother is very sick. Only a sick, disturbed person would tell a mother that a c-section means she didn\u2019t give birth. Only a sick, disturbed person would say a new mother isn\u2019t a \u201creal mom\u201d because that new mom has to use formula or supplement with formula. These two instances alone show that your mother is a very sick, disturbed, and possibly dangerous person. She made a choice to be cruel and hurtful with words towards your wife. Your mother needs a mental health evaluation and serious treatment. \n\nA restraining order may very well be in order.

Were any of these family members who called and chastised you also family members who you called \"more reasonable\"?   I ask because a flying monkey is not trustworthy no matter how innocent they may seem.\n\nClearly your mother is unhinged (this is pathological behavior)and she's gone out of her way to hide the depths of her madness from you.  Has her behavior been normalized and enabled your whole life?  Do any siblings show similar behavior? Toxicity tends to breed toxicity.  What I'm saying is you may think your mother is the problem and she is but you seem to be overlooking your other family members as just as dangerous to your family's safety as your mom.  So while I also think a restraining order should be filed against your mother, I'd also be extremely wary of the other family members because I can totally see them pretending to be on your side to trick you into lowering your defenses.  For example, inviting your family to events or places only to be confronted by your mother. Or agreeing to babysit only to allow mom access to the child....that kind of thing.  You need to prepare for the reality that because of your mother, you may have to cut off your whole immediate family and some extended as well.

Good luck!", "What states are those?", "A lot of people think that\u2026but it\u2019s actually not  true. Fitness of the parent to make the decision is considered when courts make a determination of what\u2019s in the \u201cbest interest of the child.\u201d It was established in a Supreme Court case in the late 90s/early 2000s that parents are given the benefit of the doubt that their decisions are in the best interest of their child in the absence of evidence of the contrary. This means that in all states that consider the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d in visitation disputes, the grandparents still have to show that the parents are not capable of making a decision that\u2019s best for the child. It\u2019s really not as easy as people think to get grandparents rights\u2026.particularly in this case where both parents are together and the grandmother does not have an established relationship with the child. The state would not matter.", "Your mother is abusive and its time to take legal action and get a restraining order."]}
