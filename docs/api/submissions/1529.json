Get a restraining order ASAP, and go no contact on everyone who agrees with your mother\u2019s reprehensible behavior toward your wife. I wish you love and happiness with your wife and baby.", "NTA but your mom sure is. Why would she say all those horrible things to your wife? Has she expressed in the past that she hates her? Because you wouldn\u2019t say those things to someone you love - telling any mother she didn\u2019t even \u201cgive birth\u201d because she had an emergency c section (which is a MAJOR surgery, requires more time for healing, and delays your milk) - is so disgusting.\n\nHas your mom lost her mind or has she been this way in the past?", "Thank you for your answer. I think you tried to insult me, mommas boy etc. My mother was not a kind woman and horrible mother. Second, I believe in anybody. Why would they lie to me, is my first thought always. This doesn't mean that I am naive. There are red flags that make me consider what's going on. Also I am very aware that people cheat on their spouses, friends all the time. But, as I said before it is always my first reaction to believe in. BUT I DON'T BELEIVE IN THAT THESE BODILY PROBLEMS ARE BECAUSE OF INSULTS BY YOUR MOTHER. Why? You told us she had problems after birth in the hospital. Not after your wife comes home. Also, depression doesn't cause such problems. Even your doctors didn't believe because they didn't transfer her to a psychology department. You may read some articles on depression after giving birth in the internet. It is a common problem women have after noticing that nothing would be the same. They are not free, don't give shit kind of people anymore. SO YOUR WIFE HAS REASON TO LIE. I don't say she lies. I just say the situation needs consideration. \nSo, in your case, you must talk to your mom, and even if your wife lies, you must tell your mom you have to stand by your wife, for she is the mother of your child and due to all things you may read about birth depression. \nAlso I have moral values and there are things that cannot be done according to these values. And using sprinkler is one of them. It is very low. Please don't do again. Finally it is very suspicious that you wrote all health problems. I mean I believe in you but ask myself why he writes in such great detail. It is overkill and one of my red flags. Unnecessary information for convincing who me, other redditors, yourself? \n\nI am writing in my mobile and I don't know how to add paragraphs. Sorry for inconvenience.", "I was not expecting that.
