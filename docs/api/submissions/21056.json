They didn't give us a tag or anything. I'm assuming we would be within our rights to keep them but the price is more consistent with \"use it as long as you are patronising the establishment\" kind of thing. A slightly bigger tent with lounges in other beaches go for ~\u20ac50 for the whole day, but these are not part of caf\u00e9s, it's just the space", "Hmmm I'm not entirely sure what the norm is (in my hometown's beaches, lounges are for free if you are a patron of the establishment) and there was no clear sign. The one place where I live that does rent daily, offers a slightly bigger umbrella for ~\u20ac50 a day. I don't have a lot of reference unfortunately.\n\nHere is the setup:\n\nThere were three rows of 3 or 4 sets of chairs each (in total 10 or 12 sets)\n\nBehind that was another row with a different type of chairs. Behind that was a big platform with a lot of tables with chairs (free of charge).

Had you left your towels there you'd actually be disrespecting the business.\n\nI have stayed the whole day in that sort of chairs (they were actually free), but we stayed there the whole day, we even had lunch in the same establishment. We did this for three days in the same establishment but of course we didn't leave the towels from one day to the other). Had we gone to have lunch in some other place we wouldn't have left the towels there.\n\nIn another vacation we paid for a daily access to the chairs so when we went for a walk down the beach, which included lunch, we left our stuff in our chairs. But we had paid for them for the whole day.\n\nIn the type of situation you're describing I would not have left the towels there.
