I have raised my 3 children DS 35, DS 25, DD 23 mostly on my own.\nDS 35 asked if he could move back in because he was getting divorced.  I told him he could come home to get on his feet and charged him $300 a month.\nSince he has been back DS 25 moved out. I bought a new home. DD 23 became pregnant at 20 and resides with me along with her daughter. \nThe living arrangement worked for 5 years. My son has 3 children. They would come over every other weekend. I would watch the kids a lot when they were there. I enjoyed spending time with my grandchildren and although hectic at times it worked. \nDD 23 is very immature. She has made terrible decisions.This has caused tension in the house with everyone and honestly I feel like I am at the end of my rope. \nDS 35  met a girl online. They seem to really like each other and I'm happy for him. Out of the blue he tells me her father is kicking her out and she needs a place to stay. I was shocked when he asked if she could stay with us. I was not having it but he became furious with me and said it was only for a short time until they could find a place. I reluctantly agreed. \nAt first it was ok but everytime I asked how the house hunting was going I got one excuse after another. Example - I called the bank to get pre-approval for a loan but no one called me back. \nAs time went on I was feeling more uncomfortable in my own home. Red flags kept popping up. DS 35 kept asking me what I pay a month to live there. He was asking if I was going to move in with my bf if DD moved out. He wanted to know if he could rent the home from me. His girlfriend was making me uncomfortable telling me about her freeloader uncle and sister. \nDS 35 and DD 23 had an explosive fight. He's accusing her of leaving her baby unattended. She's accusing him of stealing her things. Things went from 0 to 100 real quick. The tension in the house was nothing I ever experienced before. I was afraid someone was going to get hurt.\nI ended up calling a lawyer friend and told him everything and he said you gotta get the gf out of there because she's a day away from having tenants rights. \nI text DS 35 and told him his girlfriend isn't welcome to spend the night anymore. If she wants to come for dinner or to watch a movie that's fine. Needless to say that didn't go well. DS got a hotel room and left. Two days later he asked if he could come back. I said you are always welcome here. He asked if gf could come and I said absolutely not. \nNow DS refuses to talk to me. He is telling everyone I put him in financial ruin and that I'm a awful person. He said I chose my DD over him. I let him live here for 5 years for $300 a month when he made $30,000 a year more then me.

You\u2019re a damn saint!!!! You have done your job, let your kids deal with the responsibilities of being an adult. If your youngest is making bad choices, get custody of baby & get her out too. Time to stop madness & take control of your life. Wish you the best!!", "NTA\n\n$300/month?  While working full time at age 35?  Sounds like it is time for DS to move on and get his own place.  \n\nHe should have been saving his $ while paying such low rent to you.", "NTA. It sounds like DD is still a work in progress. In your shoes, I would be making requirements for DD to continue living there. These requirements would include building a career that will allow her to live independently and be able to financially care for her child. As for your son, thirty-five is well past the age of mooching off mom while he gets ready to leave the nest. Refusing to allow his gf to live there was the best thing you could do for him. A good kick in the pants is what he needed to get his life together and adult. Let everyone who wants to give you grief over your decision bankroll his lifestyle. INFO- how old is his gf?", "Nta", "NTA - if your 35 year old adult son and his adult girlfriend want to play house together, they can and should get their own house to do it. TheIr choices aren\u2019t your responsibility.", "Omg I can\u2019t with this adults wanting to feeeload from their parents forever! He is 35, with kids ffs, he wants to have a live in girlfriend he can have his own fucking house", "NTA", "NTA but your son is an ungrateful AH. You have a right to let who you choose to live in your home. He\u2019s an adult and it\u2019s time he started acting like one", "NTA. It's time for your eldest to be pushed back into the world. If he wants a live-in gf, he needs to have his own place. I also think it's time to have a conversation with DD about long-term planning. Gently point out that you won't be able to support her forever. You're 55 and close to retirement. She needs to start working towards bring a self-suppirting adult.", "ESH you enabled all of this horrible behavior. These are not good people you have raised", "lol at the baby tree part!", "Yes!!!! Gotta draw the line somewhere", "No 35 made a plan, it was to make 23 move out, once she's gone OP can move in with her boyfriend and what do you know? A house for 35, gf and his kids to stay over!", "Agreed. there's too many people to follow in this and it's confusing. \nEven Jay, Kay, Mae & Bae would be easier", "Definetly. What does DS and DD even mean?", "I don't charge her rent. She works low paying jobs 45% goes to childcare after taxes. That leaves her enough for gas, food and whatever else she needs for the baby. \n\nWhen he was 23 I had just finished paying his rent for college and when I would go visit him his car was in impound because his insurance lapsed. That happened 6 or 7 times.  He forgets when he was her age he made mistakes as well. \n\nIf I'm favoring her I will take the criticism.", "I thought the same thing. I guess all I can say to that is I did my best.", "I love this", "Dear son, dear daughter...DH is husband, DW is wife. If you're going to post about three children and you want to shorthand call the Bo, Mo and Ro, I'm not going to try and keep track of which dear whatever did what to whom. These ABC/DSDDDWDH  posts are annoying.", "Dear Son; Dear Daughter usually.", "Thanks for explaining, guys. OP could have used names or WORDS so that non-native speakers can understand it better...", "Not the original question you came here with so I\u2019m treading softly\u2026but yes, allowing your daughter to live with you indefinitely rent-free, while you made your son pay $300 rent for five years, does look rather unfair.", "That's all you can do. Do not let them make you do anything you don't want to do. You owe them nothing, I wish you well.", "Yeah I hate the DH DS crap and LO is the worst", "Deathstroke and Daredevil are having a family dispute, but that's what you get when you cross franchises.", "Nope. DS35 makes 30K more than OP annually, and pays $3,600 in rent for five years. DD23 makes poverty wages and pays nil. \n\nSeems totally fair, actually. DS35 has been getting one hell of a good deal for five years, and it still isn't enough to satisfy his entitlement.", "Letting a 23 year old live rent free versus a 35 year old man with multiple kids, ex wife, and a gf???", "Do you think it\u2019s the amount that matters, or the percentage of wages? Like should a person pay a set amount, or a percentage of what they make working? Obviously I\u2019m not arguing with you that the son is an entitled AH. I\u2019m just wondering if you think, in general, rent should go by wage percent.", "Like I said, it wasn\u2019t the original question, so information is lacking. Plus you clearly skipped the part where I said she\u2019s NTA for deciding who does and does not live inside her house. \n\nThe question is whether the daughter will still be living with her mom, rent free, at 35. But again\u2026not really the issue here.", "I think if someone is going to charge less than market rent, it's on them to determine what's appropriate to charge, whether the renter is family, friend, or stranger in need. \n\nI don't have a set rule about it, other than believing rent shouldn't impoverish someone (I believe my government calls 33% of gross wages, \"reasonable\", and local rents are generally much higher than that.)\n\nThat said, I did use some numbers to compare... my own rent is about 25% of my gross, and if DS35 were paying the same he'd be more than double his current rate, and still well below anything in my market. If DD23 is earning at poverty levels as I surmise, she'd pay far less even at 25%. \n\nMy comparison is moot, though; it's OP's decision what's fair, and as you say, nothing can change that DS35 is suffering from a major case of entitlement."]}
