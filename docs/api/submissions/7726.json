I have decided to start wearing a tank top under my clothes instead of a bra and I wear lots of layers anyway so, despite having a bigger than average chest, it really isn't noticeable that I'm not wearing a bra.\n\nThe other day I was playing a running game with one of the children so I took my top layer off, I still had on the tank top, a t-shirt, some overalls and a baggy jumper so I was very much covered. Despite this, I was called in to discuss my clothing choices. I had no idea what my boss (42M) was talking about until he mentioned that I really should be wearing a bra around children. I was shocked that he'd even point it out. I told him I felt that I could live without one if it wasn't obvious and that wearing one was causing me a lot of pain. He said that work was not meant to be comfortable and that I should stick to the 'unwritten dress code'. I said I would not be wearing one going forward unless the school were willing to pay for one of the comfortable sports bras they make for larger chests (they usually range in price from \u00a370-\u00a3150). My boss said I was being unreasonable with my requests and that I would have to wear a bra going forward. If there had been complaints from parents I would understand but no one has said anything apart from him. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

While it's my preference to see professional people looking professional, I would never dream of calling a woman out for going without a bra. It's her fucking choice to wear it or not. And I think it's pretty close to sexual harassment to bring it up.", "I think that your common sense is broken. If you think that way, the boss should also put in your list that it's not allowed to lick door knob or to not eat your poop in front of everyone ?", "im a teacher with 40DDD\u2019s. just because i have to live this reality doesnt make me a sexist pig.", "maybe you work in a district with a different culture. doesnt mean parents in her district will be so understanding.", "My previous job also provided a hi-vis vest. And a uniform at that. Including winter version (long sleeves/sweater)\n and summer version. All I needed to provide was shoes really. And I was expected to tie my hair, but everyone was.", "okay sure, but it is her bosses problem so he is trying to deal with it proactively. you can\u2019t be missing the point this badly for real.", "Ok.. i have gone to far....", "Omg it's a double rainbow!!\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf08 That guy's joy was awesome.", "That\u2019s not a thing outside the US.", "Damn. Meant the bra size of course...", "I think your common sense is broken if you think that's a fair analogy.\n\nThose would fall under highly unsanitary or highly unprofessional behaviors particularly when you have small children observing you at your work.  \n\nWhether or not you wear underwear doesn't compare.  Most little girls don't wear bras either so they might not even wonder about it.\n\nJust because bras were invented doesn't mean women must buy and wear them.", "Again, you\u2019re comparing it to extremes. There is no social scenario where those things are acceptable. Not wearing a bra is fine for the vast majority of people. He probably wouldn\u2019t even have noticed if OP was a smaller cup size. Where do you draw the line? \u201cMust wear bra if size DD or above\u201d? \u201cAll members of staff must wear an underwired bra?\u201d Remember OP is non-binary, so the boss can\u2019t specify women.", "I fail to see how you don't understand MY point. It is ridiculous to keep feeding into this notion that someone's body parts being noticeable to others is a problem. It's a body. It's there. I find it insane how many people seem to be so fixated.", "But it's all for safety, right? :)", "Surely you\u2019ve still gone wrong somewhere band sizes generally range from 28-56 how you got 95? Lol.", "i don't even think you're wrong about that but you can't make your point at someone else's expense. it seems clear that OPs boss doesn't want to lead a social revolution and tell parents to fuck off when they raise the issue. her boss is obviously going to be the one dealing with the blowback. she can wear what she wants when she works for herself, of course.", "Europeans might have a different size system here as well...", "We don't know where he lives tho.\n\nWhere I live it usually ranges from 75 to 100", "Centimetres, not inches probably", "I do get what you're saying. Though I think OP does have a point that, if their boss is the one telling them they have to dress a certain way for work, seems reasonable to get compensated for that.\n\nJust kinda frustrating and ridiculous to me that there are so many people out there who think that another person's body, that they were born with, is such a problem. And I wish there were more people like OP's boss on board with changing the narrative. But I do understand your point."]}
