Can you guys tell me if I'm in the wrong here?\r  \n\r  \nSo, my daughter and her husband, who have been married for a year and together for three years, recently asked if they could move into my house. The thing is, they have four dogs. A chocolate lab, a cane corso, a great dane and this small poodle mix that looks quite unique. Now these dogs are completely untrained and cause a lot of damage. They've already ruined two apartments and even got kicked out of a rented house because of the destruction caused by their pets. I mean we're talking about destroyed personal belongings, furniture in shambles and constant indoor accidents because they let the dogs roam freely even when they're not at home.\r  \n\r  \nJust recently, their cane corso attacked the poodle mix pretty badly that now the little dog is recovering at my place. But eventually it will go back to them. Right now? They are living in this converted bus that serves as their makeshift mobile home parked in our son in law's friend's backyard. But unfortunately, they've been told to leave by the end of this month.\r  \n\r  \nThis bus arrangement was just something temporary they came up with after being evicted from their previous rented house.\r  \nMy son in law used to have a well paying job in construction, but he made the decision to become a firefighter. Unfortunately, he didn't pass his national exam and is currently unemployed until April. He's actively searching for temporary work, but it's proving to be challenging.\r  \n\r  \nThey've asked me several times if they can move in with me, but I've always declined mainly because of their dogs behavior. I already live with my two other adult sons and we have a decent sized yard and an extra bedroom. However, I'm concerned about the potential chaos that their dogs might bring. The past instances of their dogs causing damage and the recent attack on the poodle mix have only reinforced my decision.\r  \n\r  \nI've expressed to them that they are welcome to stay without their dogs. Unfortunately, this refusal has led my daughter to believe that I don't support her and that my love comes with conditions. Consequently, she has cut off communication with me and refuses to participate in any family gatherings, including Christmas.\r  \n\r  \nIn the meantime, a distant friend of my son in law has kindly offered to accommodate them along with their dogs. They will be living about an hour and a half away in a home where there are other dogs and children.\r  \n\r  \nAt present, I have a small elderly pug, a shy cat and four chickens residing in my backyard.\r  \nI have a strong belief that having their dogs here would put the chickens in danger.

The cane corso has already attacked one dog, what\u2019s to stop it from going after the elderly pug? Your chickens will be in serious danger, and even if your cat is fast enough to stay out of the dogs\u2019 reach, the poor thing will be severely stressed out. Don\u2019t let them destroy your home as well.", "Also though - if you can please keep the poor poodle. Don\u2019t send it back because it might not survive a second time.", "Perfect comment. Seconded.", "This", "Agreed. Life is about compromise. You offered for her to stay its just not 100% on HER terms. Why are you the only one that needs to sacrifice?? I\u2019m sure this friend is going to regret their decision of generosity once the chaos and damage begins.", "Yeap. Im a huge dog lover, to me dogs are love and l wouldn't like to have a home without them. But you need to take the dogs personality into the equation. My dog (Golden retriever) is a lazy, sleep and cuddle all day type, who almost needs an uber to go to a walk, so l wouldn't feel bad having her in a small apartment. \n\nBut wanting to impose 4 dogs who cant behave on your \"external family\" and cutting them out of your life because they have concerns is just ridiculous behaviour.", "OP's daughter is manipulating OP by saying OP's love comes with conditions.  It does not.  What comes with conditions is who can move into the house.  The daughter and and SIL are welcome, just not 4 destructive dogs.", "Yeap.

First time I've seen this mentioned\n\nThey will not be living with the family friend for long. I give it 2 months before they're kicked out once again because they didn't train their dogs\n\nThis is no ones fault but the couples. They are very bad pet owners and it won't be long before a child is hurt by their irresponsibility", "Same I\u2019m worried for the little poodle", "NTA. And it\u2019s terrifying to think what kind of hell these untrained dogs could create and to some extent already have.", "Yes, I reiterated that if it were just she and her husband and maybe just one other dog I would without a doubt open my door to them and help them out \ud83e\udd79", "Especially because these dogs are left alone all day while they are at work. I work full time as well. It\u2019s not possible to love and nurture these dogs on a daily basis or give them the structure they need and deserve", "Nta the untrained dogs are the issue and they don\u2019t sound like responsible dog owners. Keep your foot down.", "NTA They wouldn't be in this situation if they had taken the time to train their dogs. Furthermore, he ought to have stayed in his lucrative employment until he was hired as a firefighter.", "I\u2019m worried about this other friend willing to take them in and has children and other dogs. Someone is going to get severely hurt or killed.", "I agree. They're doing a disservice to the dogs as well.", "Those poor children at the place they're moving to.", "Hell, I'd keep the poodle if it was trainable and able to be socialized.", "I do too honestly. That was my initial fear when I saw that. I\u2019ve had Danes since before my son was born but from the moment we got them I\u2019ve worked with them and the moment I had him, I was very strict with everyone on being gentle. I literally raised my son from an infant petting the dogs saying gentle cause of fear of my son getting hurt.", "They are. They need to be rehomed to better owners"]}
