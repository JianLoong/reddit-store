He was the dog I got as a single lady in college. It was he and I for a long time. Met my husband had some sons. He got to see 3 born. He was the coolest dog. Drive thrus would give him burgers and bacon on the house because he was just so darn loveable. \nMakes it worse how he was treated by someone who claimed to care about him.", "Right. I'm so upset my mother continues to side with them. I'm seriously about to go no contact with her. She is so poisonous. She continues to shield her son from his own actions and throwing me and mine under the bus to do so. Man... families are such a mind fuck.", "No she never responded. I'll never know the reasoning. My brother and I don't get along but I had always been nice to her and pleasant. Technically they were just engaged at the time. I think it was a more sinister thing as all while I'm requesting this info they have a secret engagement and baby going on. My dog died before their shotgun weddding and before baby was born. But there had never been an issue with her and I . I believe my brother told her some false stuff. There is a whole list of things he wants not brought up around her. I unlike everyone else in the fam said I would not tiptoe around someone brought into the fold.  Ever since he has been doing weird scheming things. All to make me look a certain way to her so if I do call out the lies then I'm just the crazy sister. It's very strange. \n\nBut regardless there should be no excuse. If you have a patient you take care of them. How easy to fax a medical record to help an innocent dog."]}
