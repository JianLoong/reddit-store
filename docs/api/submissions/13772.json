It called a restaurateur.\n\n\n>She told me it's not some restaurant it's someone's career", "NTA. Your SIL was unprofessional and deserved to be called out.", "Thank you. He was the dog I got as a single lady in college. It was he and I for a long time. Met my husband had some sons. He got to see 3 born. He was the coolest dog. Drive thrus would give him burgers and bacon on the house because he was just so darn loveable. \nMakes it worse how he was treated by someone who claimed to care about him.", "Right. I'm so upset my mother continues to side with them. I'm seriously about to go no contact with her. She is so poisonous. She continues to shield her son from his own actions and throwing me and mine under the bus to do so. Man... families are such a mind fuck.", "No she never responded. I'll never know the reasoning. My brother and I don't get along but I had always been nice to her and pleasant. Technically they were just engaged at the time. I think it was a more sinister thing as all while I'm requesting this info they have a secret engagement and baby going on. My dog died before their shotgun weddding and before baby was born. But there had never been an issue with her and I . I believe my brother told her some false stuff. There is a whole list of things he wants not brought up around her. I unlike everyone else in the fam said I would not tiptoe around someone brought into the fold.  Ever since he has been doing weird scheming things. All to make me look a certain way to her so if I do call out the lies then I'm just the crazy sister. It's very strange. \n\nBut regardless there should be no excuse. If you have a patient you take care of them. How easy to fax a medical record to help an innocent dog.", "A restaurant is also someone's career.\n\nAnyway, NTA. It's an honest review, if she didn't want that, then she should had just sent the f***ing records!", "NTA. I'm sorry for your loss of your beloved family member.", "If your SIL is willing to treat her husband's family like this, imagine how she's treating strangers and their pets. Thank you for warning others even though it's going to cause tension in your family. Absolutely NTA and I'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA she killed your dog.", "> it's someone's career \n\nIn which case she should have done her fucking job!\n\nNTA.", "I would report her for this never mind just leaving a review. Highly unprofessional and unethical.", "NTA, that's really messed up", "NTA. That's incredibly unprofessional and irresponsible of her.", "This. This is what matters here - it\u2019s not about her treatment of OP (appalling as that is), it\u2019s about her treatment of the dog. Bad vet! Bad!", "\"It's someone's career\" that she didn't perform to professional, reasonable or humane standards.\n\nI'd have been seething if someone in my family had made me take my dying dog for examinations and tests she doesn't need.\n\nI hope your review was scathing. Your SIL hasn't a leg to stand on and your mum can f\\*ck off with her criticism of you and support for your 'care less' SIL\n\nNTA", "Yeah,  it IS someone's career....and she chose to do a shitty thing whilst performing that career. Which caused pain and unnecessary stress and whatnot to a terminally ill dog.\n\nNot a real good look for a vet, even if she is your SIL.\n\nNTA.", "I had the same thought.", "I do not advocate violence, but I would make an exception this one time if I could bap her on the face with a rolled newspaper.", "Yes. I don\u2019t know Bunny-the-Flying-Cat\u2019s position on dogs, but I feel confident that u/mimi7600 would be willing to deliver some baps in this matter.", "NTA - This is the exact kind of information I would want to know when looking for a vet. I\u2019ve had the same issue with my own doctor and it needlessly set my care back at least four months. That was just pain, not even a terminal illness. Just sadistic. My condolences for your pup.", "Report her to the board or her boss, put it in writing too and send its certified mail or signed for. So sorry for the loss of your furbaby x", "NTA and I would report her to veterinary boards. Withholding patient information seems illegal? If not illegal it is absolutely 100% unethical. Your moms reaction is concerning because uh you're her kid and SIL is probably just a financial security for your siblings in your mom's eyes if she's taking her side.\n\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss", "NTA, should someone who causes unnecessary suffering to a dog still be a vet?\n\nAlso tell your mum that people have careers in restaurants, that's how she gets to eat at restaurants.", "If your SIL's career is so important, then she would have done a better job at it. If you gave an honest review, then she really can't complain. \n\nNTA", "Sounds to me like she didn't send them as they are hiding something tbh maybe charging you things the shouldn't and didn't want it bringing to light, also your mother is an AH I'd definitely go no contact", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe held a pet's medical records hostage to force a customer not to change provider. And you were even family. Calling her out and warning others was right.", "NTA. \n\nIt was a straightforward and honest review. You weren\u2019t mean about it. You just stated the facts.", "If she dismissed you, who is someone in her family. Imagine how she would treat a stranger? NTA", "OP is being way too generous not suing this lady IMO. If details here are correct then there was definitely a duty to care not met.", "Yes.  Report her to a governing board.", "Leave that review up, next time it could be someone else\u2019s loved pet. She allowed your dog to endure unnecessary pain, and for what? Because she may not like you? Because she was mad you switched vets? Because\u2026.? \n\nAlso, if you called the vet itself, I\u2019m guessing you spoke with an office manager who started the process for you, so her employee would know to inform her. \n\nAbove all else, I find this wickedly cruel given that she\u2019s a VET and supposedly cares for animals in the same way a doctor does humans. You don\u2019t go into that profession because you hate helping. \n\nYou\u2019ll never be on the side of right with your family, so just let them go. I\u2019d leave my review on the vets business pages and a official review websites. \n\nI\u2019d also keep any and all documentation about your correspondence with the clinics so you have a paper trail to prove you repeatedly sought for the records and this is all the occurred due to her negligence (in case SIL makes a stink about slander or whatever). \n\nI\u2019d leave that review up knowing another pupper might not suffer and that it\u2019s what you should do for your furry best friends unconditional love and companionship.

Depending on how far they live now it may not have been feasible to simply show up at her office.", "Op said she moved to another state in her post. It could be a state that's really far away. Makes no sense to travel all the way just to demand records."]}
