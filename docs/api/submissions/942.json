To be fair, I had suspicions but put it out of my brain as you do when you want to enjoy a surprise. And I definitely wasn't sure and didn't know what was happening or when/where. But I showed up to what I thought was just an errand and it was mostly moms from my kids' school and some of my other female friends it was sort of like a spa/pamper day. \n\nThe only thing is that my SIL (who is also a mom at the same school and thus knew most of the guests) wasn\u2019t present. Admittedly, I immediately knew it would be a problem and given the way the party was structured, I could easily have called and included her, there would have been room for her, but I just wasn\u2019t really wanting to deal with it or create drama. I also knew exactly why she wasn't invited.\n\nSIL/BIL/their kids moved to our area and started at our school as of this year. It's not a big school so from the start I introduced her to my friends among the parents. But SIL had a really hard time fitting in. There are multiple reasons for this but one is that she's just not a very pleasant person. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s particularly offended the person who threw the party as far as I know, but that woman is close friends with another parent who SIL was rude to. That specific incident did not make SIL a lot of friends. People are polite to her because that\u2019s what you do and maybe because they like me but very few people that I know at least actually seem to like her. So while it was a little rude to not invite her, I do understand and in the moment didn't want to invite her myself.\n\nI had a lovely time. SIL found out of course because she\u2019s a parent at the same school and it\u2019s not that big of a school. I didn't post on social because I'm not on there much but others did. I could have stopped them I guess. To be honest, because SIL hasn't lived in our city that long, I don't think she has many other friends other than the other parents so I understand why it was hurtful. Plus a lot of SIL's rudeness comes more from insecurity than anything, she's a little easier when you get to know her.\n\nSIL is upset that she wasn\u2019t invited and is complaining to everyone in our family that I purposely excluded her and my friends are being cliquey.
