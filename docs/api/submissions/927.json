She apologised and said that I shouldn't have told him that she lied because only I knew how much she likes him and I could be a lot more understanding. \n\n\nI do not know what to feel anymore.

If he wasn't interested in her from the start do you honestly think he would have been interested in her after the lies about your reputation? This girl is not your best friend. Yes you knew she like him but he dudnt like her. She can't make someone like her just by spreading lies about you. Also do you want to continue to be friends with with someone that is willing to ruin your reputation over a guy? You only found out because he told you. What if the next person doesn't reach out to you. She's the AH and she's clearly not a real friend.  You deserve better", "NTA. \n\nYour \"bestie\" ruined a great friendship over a guy, time to find a new bestie!\n\nThe trash took itself out", "NTA.\nYou didn't ruin her chances, he wasn't interested. Honestly it sounds like she was creeping on this poor guy. Your friend was being incredibly manipulative and proved as much as she \"liked\" him, she didn't respect him at all.", "If she's willing to say things to other people that she knows could upset you to be with a guy while you're both still 20, who knows what she will do when you're older.

But I think you did the right thing in this situation.", "NTA\n\nOdds are hes seen pics of you & her on SM and asked about you, so she made up some truly shitty lies about you, so he wouldn't be interested. Well that backfired.\n\nThis girl is not your friend. She was willing to paint you as a whole different type of person for her own benefit, and I can guarantee its probably not the first time she's done it. Just the first time her lies have unravelled and she got called out.\n\nETA: Being crazy about him doesn't excuse or warrant her behaviour, infact it comes across creepy and stalker like. She needs to accept hes not into her. Hes already ghosted her once...", "NTA\n\nShe never had a chance with this guy. He made it very clear he\u2019s not interested in her.

It's a betrayal to have your homegirl, whom you trust, trying to go after the person you like.", "NTA for correcting the lies she spread about you.\n\nHowever, you need to work on your judgemental attitude - you can\u2019t call women sluts and then say you don\u2019t judge their dating style\u2026\nAlso\u2026 don\u2019t enable a person who can\u2019t take no for an answer.

It's vile.\n\nYTA", "On top of this, just because you've known someone a long time, that doesn't make them a friend. One of the most important lessons is finding out who is a real friend and who was just around that you eventually need to outgrow. This friend is a bunch of red flags, just in dragging you along to run into this guy in another university.\n\nBest wishes on moving on from this and hope you are able to make genuine friendships soon. You deserve friends who value you.", "It's even worse. This guy clearly will never have any long term interest in your \"friend.\" She cares more about a short term hookup with this guy than you. You share a career path with this guy, slut-shaming you to him is bad for your career. A moment with a boy she barely knows is more important to her than your career.", "NTA. OP, I would text your friend. \"I understood that you had a big thing for X and was only polite with him when we met, even though he seemed interested in me. He has reached out asking if I would date him. Since I considered you a friend, I would normally turn him down. But since you decided to lie about me, and portray me as a woman who juggles multiple men, I don't really see you as a friend any longer. I intend to go out with him. I also intend to take some space from our friendship to reevaluate whether I want to have a relationship with you any longer. I hope you take some time to think about whether betraying me was worth it.\"\n\nThen, I would date the guy. I would also SERIOUSLY step back from this \"friend.\" If she does the work to repair your relationship, you can try to rebuild things. If she just insults you and doubles down, block her on everything and move on with your life.", "Agreed that OP did nothing wrong by simply stating what her \"friend\" said was a lie. People who would throw their friends under the bus for a _*potential*_ hookup or romantic partner aren't trustworthy. How can you trust someone who would lie on a friend's character, or ditch them without question, for a chance to get with someone they barely know?\n\nOP's friend gives me the vibe that if she gets with a guy, she would flake on plans and leave friends in a bind without question.\n\nEdit: It is unclear if OP is actually into this guy, but it would be kind of shady to get with someone if your good friend had made their interest/intent known. But, alas, this doesn't appear to be a friend at all...", "when teh nice guy i was into, was clearly intrested in my besty?  yeh. i encouraged that shit. because shes amazing. i cant imagin lieing about her.\n\nget a new besty.

Not nowhere in her statement did I see that she was being judgmental. She made a point to specify that people who have multiple partners is normal, it's a life choice, it's a way of life that they choose to live, but it is not her way to choose to live like that. So in no way did I see that she was being judgmental about talking about girls or guys who have multiple partners as being a bad thing she just said that's just not something she's into. But it does shows how judgmental you are because you judging her by her preference. Everyone has their preference in how they want to live their life and if she is career goal focus then let her focus on her career. She got her whole life ahead of her, she's in her twenties and if she's prepared to be in a romantic relationship with someone now or later that is her decision. I saw nothing wrong with anything she said maybe you need to change your perspective on how you're seeing things, little food for thought.", "Have to agree. She's not an asshole for setting the record straight but like seriously, dating more than one person at a time does not make anyone a slut and the fact that her friend thought that telling this guy this would somehow deter him from liking her just goes to show both these girls have some growing up to do.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
