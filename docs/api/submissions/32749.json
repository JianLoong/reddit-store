This has really pushed me away  after a lot of  debating and pushing my boundaries. I could go into all of that but that's not what the post is about. If you need more for a verdict I will put more down. \n\nMy husband and I are expecting our first child and are very excited! My mom wants to throw me a baby shower. I said she can but the only thing I ask is that it's not religious. And to my surprise she agrees without a fight! It was such a relief. \n\nMy aunt's and I get together to discuss baby shower a couple months later and I learn that 1) it will be held at a church 2) my aunt is doing a prayer for the baby. I'm in absolute shock. When I voice my thoughts on it. I'm shut down immediately and am told this is how baby showers all are. I pull my mom aside and say that she agreed with my request to make it non religious. She claims that she never agreed to that and that goes against her beliefs. I leave crying\n\nLater that week, I call my mom with a compromise instead of a prayer. Let's read this poem instead. She says absolutely not. I canceled the baby shower because I was hurt and heart broken. My aunt messages me and says(short version)  I'm a horrible daughter and how dare I ever ask her to do something non religious because it's not what she believes. And why am I lying to everyone because I agreed to have the prayer and approved everything at the meeting with the aunts. Her husband even heard me agree to it enthusiastically.  Here's where I might be the asshole. I responded with \u201cI did not agree to anything and that i thought you and my mom would respect me and my family. I want nothing to do with you because you have never respected me and my wishes ever. You're a vile woman.\u201d\n\nIs it wrong of me to ask for something non religious when that what they believe? I never feel respected or welcome when my aunt is around. My mom says people won't come to the shower if there isn't a prayer. My thoughts are how would they know? I thought I put up a good compromise. But it's my mom throwing the shower. My friends say I'm in the right to cancel but my dad (who has been a neutral party in all of this) says I should still have the shower.

You were quite clear from the start.  Ask your friends to hold a shower for you at one of their homes instead.

That\u2019s not the case, at all. You don\u2019t have to do anything you don\u2019t want to do. Your family clearly doesn\u2019t respect your wishes, and if they\u2019re doing this before your bundle of joy is here, it\u2019s only going to get worse one he/she arrives (taking your baby to church without your knowledge).", "NTA. You don\u2019t want religion involved and you put your foot down, and they completely ignored you. This is YOUR and your HUSBANDS baby and you both agreed to a non religious baby shower, so no one else\u2019s opinion matters. ALSO, you were willing to compromise, and no one else is. Stick to your guns.", "NTA your mom should have respected your wishes.", "NTA\n\nIt's your baby shower. Of course you can ask for what you want & expect people to respect that.\n\nYou even still tried to compromise when you asked for a poem not a prayer.\n\nAll baby showers aren't held in church. I've never been to one that is.\n\nYour mom & aunt are prime AHs for upsetting you & making you cry when this should be a happy time for you.\n\nDo something nice with your friends.\n\nI wonder if your mom/aunt will be on here whining about why they can't see the baby if you & your husband finally have enough of their s$$t and go NC with both of them.", "NTA - I\u2019ve had two baby showers, neither had a drop of religion. \n\nAsk one or a group of your friends to throw you one since your mom can\u2019t be trusted.

If someone is toxic and hurtful, you don\u2019t have to have them in your or your child\u2019s life. \n\nYou\u2019re becoming a parent now, and protecting your child\u2019s emotional and mental development is important. Toxic family doesn\u2019t have a place in that.\n\nYou\u2019ll also have to set strict boundaries with your parents now about talking/pushing religion on your child. It\u2019s better to have it now, before the baby comes than after and trying to play catch up. You will teach them religion if and as you feel appropriate. No religious toys, books, prayers, chats, etc. if they can\u2019t respect it, it\u2019s better to know now before they develop a relationship with your child. \n\nYou have religious trauma from your parents, you don\u2019t want them passing it on to your child.", "NTA. You're not asking your mom to go \"against\" her beliefs, you're not asking her to do a baby shower that's of satanism or Wicca or any other religion. You're asking her to *not* do something that would make you and probably your friends uncomfortable.\n\nAnd baby showers are not a Christian invention! Plenty of people have baby showers where religion's just not a factor, and people (yes, even Christian guests) still show up because a baby shower is not a religious ceremony or even vaguely about religion like a holiday party would be.\n\nYour mom and aunt are gaslighting you (edit, by insisting that you had already agreed to a religious shower). Your request was not out of order or even remotely disrespectful, and they're exaggerating how important it is to their guests. If they were actually like, devout enough to have Christian compassion, they would compromise with you. Forcing this on you just shows that their focus on religion is more about controlling you and by extension your baby than about their relationship with God.", "NTA. For someone who's so religious, she sure had no problem lying to you. What religion is it that says it's fine to lie?", "NTA. I\u2019d definitely go low or no contact\u2014because they will *absolutely* try to force religion onto your baby every second they\u2019re able to, and you\u2019ll never escape their guilt tripping and disrespect", "Nta", ">My mom says people won't come to the shower if there isn't a prayer.\n\nIn what reality? People have non-religious baby showers all the time, there's nothing in the \"rules\" that says baby showers have to be religious at all. That's just ridiculous.\n\nNTA. You made your position clear from the beginning and they chose to disregard your feelings, and now they're lying to you and trying to gaslight you over what you know you said. Nothing wrong with walking away from the whole thing.", "NTA.

You are on probation between now and when the baby is born, and, quite frankly, for a long time after that.

There\u2019s two things about Boundaries (and I highly recommend the book Boundaries by Cloud and Townsend, there\u2019s some religious themes there because the religious seem to need them the most).\n\nOne - Boundaries without consequences are wishes. You hope they follow them, but if they don\u2019t, and there\u2019s no consequence, there\u2019s nothing to stop them not following them again. \n\nTwo - Boundaries aren\u2019t punishments, they\u2019re a statement of what you\u2019ll allow in your life. \u201cI don\u2019t allow X religious themes in my or my child\u2019s life, if people push that, I will need to take a break from them.\u201d Is a boundary. Then follow through with taking the break. Even over holidays and important dates/events unless you really want to go for YOU. \n\nI also highly recommend the books \u201cToxic Parents - Susan Forward\u201d, \u201cAdult Children of Emotionally Immature parents\u201d, and Gavin de Becker books, \u201cThe gift of fear\u201d and \u201cProtecting the gift.\u201d \n\nA lot of religious parents use emotional manipulation and guilt to rule their children, therapy for yourself to work through that is highly important. Notice your mother has centered herself in your baby shower. It\u2019s not about you, but how she feels about her religion not being included.", "If your mother is going to be allowed to have your child for the day or anything, you might want to talk to the pastor at her church and tell them that you do not approve of a christening. Because no doubt your mother will try to christen the baby without your approval.", "Maybe your husbands family will host a shower.", "You know your stuff! All those books you mentioned would be 100% perfect for her to check out. You give excellent advice.\n\n\u2026.btw, I\u2019m looking for a new therapist that\u2019s knowledgeable and savvy.
