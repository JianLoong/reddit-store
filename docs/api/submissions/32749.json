This has really pushed me away  after a lot of  debating and pushing my boundaries. I could go into all of that but that's not what the post is about. If you need more for a verdict I will put more down. \n\nMy husband and I are expecting our first child and are very excited! My mom wants to throw me a baby shower. I said she can but the only thing I ask is that it's not religious. And to my surprise she agrees without a fight! It was such a relief. \n\nMy aunt's and I get together to discuss baby shower a couple months later and I learn that 1) it will be held at a church 2) my aunt is doing a prayer for the baby. I'm in absolute shock. When I voice my thoughts on it. I'm shut down immediately and am told this is how baby showers all are. I pull my mom aside and say that she agreed with my request to make it non religious. She claims that she never agreed to that and that goes against her beliefs. I leave crying\n\nLater that week, I call my mom with a compromise instead of a prayer. Let's read this poem instead. She says absolutely not. I canceled the baby shower because I was hurt and heart broken. My aunt messages me and says(short version)  I'm a horrible daughter and how dare I ever ask her to do something non religious because it's not what she believes. And why am I lying to everyone because I agreed to have the prayer and approved everything at the meeting with the aunts. Her husband even heard me agree to it enthusiastically.  Here's where I might be the asshole. I responded with \u201cI did not agree to anything and that i thought you and my mom would respect me and my family. I want nothing to do with you because you have never respected me and my wishes ever. You're a vile woman.\u201d\n\nIs it wrong of me to ask for something non religious when that what they believe? I never feel respected or welcome when my aunt is around. My mom says people won't come to the shower if there isn't a prayer. My thoughts are how would they know? I thought I put up a good compromise. But it's my mom throwing the shower. My friends say I'm in the right to cancel but my dad (who has been a neutral party in all of this) says I should still have the shower.

This is your baby shower. Not hers. As much as I hate baby showers (its the same with bridal showers. I just find it weird and uncomfortable... which is a \\*me\\* problem not a you) but if this is something important that you want to do for your baby... then I would have one but make sure they aren't in control of it. Its a good place to get gifts and advice and sharing in this joy you are having. Despite the feelings with the family dipshits. I would sit down and make a pro and cons list. Include them acting like children in the Cons :p If this is something you want. Do it. If its not calling out to you don't hurt your mental health to bend to others.
