Some context to share, I don't often see my niece because I do not get along with her father (different story) so I havent seen her in over a year but even so, we never really hung out in this occasion but obviously we are still comfortable enough to be left alone. Because that she never been around an active city with public trains/metro, she was curious and asked if we can take a walk around and with her mothers permission, we went out and ventured the area.\n\nSo the area we were in is pretty known for our sports team so there were plenty of people around wearing the team jerseys and other apparel. My niece said she liked the way it looked and asked if she can have some of the clothing. I didnt mind at all buying some things so I took her to a nearby store and she went a little too far grabbing 10+ things. Mind you, because we are at a touristy area, prices are hiked up so incredibly so I had to stop her from there and tell her, \"hold on hold on this is too many things that costs money. I cant afford this for you, sweetheart\".\n\nShe was a bit confused and asked, \"you dont have money, uncle?\". I then tell her, \"I have money but I have to save for your cousin (my son) and his mommy and my house (pretty much mortgage)\". She was even more confused and asked how I can live in a house without buying it. I chuckled a bit and told her that I pay monthly and all that \"adulting\" things. But long story short, she kept asking more questions about finances and I mention that adults (including her parents) work all the time to have a roof over our head. I also mention doctors, car, food, and other things cost money. It's not like i went on a tangent about this subject but I did give her basic understandings what adults have to go through and I feel it's important to mention that she's the one who asked.  After buying her some of the clothes, we went home as she was happily wearing her apparel. Her mother came by, picked her up, thanked me for buying the clothes and left.\n\nThe next day, my sister called and yelled at me why I \"told her daughter things what she shouldnt have to hear\". I was really confused and asked what she meant by that. She was basically scolding me and kept saying, \"kids should be kids, they dont have to hear about finances or jobs or anything! My daughter kept saying she is going to try to make money next summer so she can pay you back for the clothes you bought\". I was pretty floored about sweet my niece is to do that. But I was still confused why she scolded me when she's eventually going to learn about this stuff anyways. My sister and her husband demanded I do not give her anymore \"lectures\" when they are the parents. I didnt think I was lecturing at all when she asked me these things. AITA?\n\nETA:\n\nI called my niece afterwards and told her I was happy to buy things for her and she never needs to pay me back. She still wants to and even asked how she can make money at her age. I wanted to mention shoveling or regular house work for neighbors but because of what I mentioned above, I told her to ask her parents so they wouldnt give me more shit. She even begged a little. Feel a lot of opportunities she is going to miss but thats just my opinion. Already sounds like a little entrepreneur.", "created_utc": 1667404634, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yk8yzc/aita_for_telling_my_niece_the_basics_of_finance/", "score": 115, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She asked and you answered. This is how kids learn things. Your sister\u2019s approach is how you raise kids who are unprepared to be adults. And I find your niece\u2019s reaction to your explanation touching!", "NTA. You explained because SHE ASKED. It's important for everyone to understand these things. Your niece's mom should be thanking you for giving her daughter a private tutoring session and for buying her some clothes. She's being ridiculous.", "How could you possibly be the AH? At 8, I had an allowance I could spend on the stuff my mom didn't want to buy, like some toys or stuff.\n\nIt sounds like this kid never went to a store in her life. You gave her a favor because she's really old for having no clue about what money is and how it works.\n\nThat's not really finance, it's just basic everyday stuff. It's not like you told her to invest in Bitcoin and explained her stock market lol.\n\nNTA OP, your sis is through.", "NTA.  \n\nI had my nephew a lot over weekends when he was growing up.  I *always* answered his questions, about everything.   Always told him child-sized versions of the truth.  At least until he was 12, then I told him the whole truth.  He's 32 now, and we're still close.  Probably because I never dismissed his questions, and he knows he can count on me to give him real answers. \n\nAnswering a child's questions is important.  Your niece's parents should be glad you're helping.", "NTA (1) Niece asked. (2) It's important that kids start learning about money and finances in a healthy and reasonable way at an early age. So that they can have a healthy relationship with money.\n\nMy nieces are 7. They understand that 'things' have a financial cost. And that if they want something they have to wait for a special occasion or save up money they get for special occasions or from doing \"jobs\" around their home or grandma's house. \n\nFor example, my mom will pay them for doing things like collecting pine cones when their school wants pine cones. 1 bag = $1. Or I'll give them a gift card for holidays. It helps them learn how to handle money- even if it's just money that they spend on toys.", "NTA It sounds like you gave age appropriate answers to the questions your niece asked. I doubt you guilted her into anything. It's normal for a child to want to do something kind for an adult who has been kind to her, hence the talk of repaying you. If I was her mother, I would just explain that there's no need to pay for a gift freely given and she can repay you by doing something nice for you birthday.", "NTA\n\nKids ask A LOT of questions and I\u2019ve seen a lot of parents brush off the questions only to raise a kid who has no common knowledge because the parents didn\u2019t want to deal with it. This is not an attack against parents, I understand that answering 500 questions a day gets tiring and sometimes you just can\u2019t. \n\nGood on you for helping your niece learn! My parents refused to talk any sort of finances with me until I was leaving for college and there was a lot of confusion in the sudden learning process.", "NTA - You were nurturing her curiosity. She asked and from what I read you explained in an age appropriate way! Sure she wanted to warm money and pay you back but I think that's her way of trying to thank you, not that she fees guilty or anything, it's just a cute thing. I don't get why her mother couldn't just say, you don't need to do that, it was a gift etc. and that way she could've learned something else new.\n\nImo you weren't unreasonable and it was a nice way for her to be introduced to the concept of money", "NTA.  Your niece asked questions and you answered.  I don't think an 8 yo would be harmed knowing that a money from an income is used to pay for things, like sports gear, rent, food, movies, dinners out.\n\nYou prolly should tell your niece that your income also covers gifts, and the sports gear was a gift and that she doesn't owe you anything.  \n\nYour sister is not doing your niece any favors by not telling her the basic facts about living in this world.  I am not saying your niece needs a finance degree before high school, basic facts are useful.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would try to have follow up conversations to make sure she knows you get more money from your job than you have to spend on housing etc, and that one of the pleasures of being an adult with a job is being able to give things to people.", "NTA. She asked questions and you answered. Simple as that.", "NTA  Kids inherently know money comes for working.", "NTA.  Kids gonna ask stuff.  If her mother wants her not to hear things, then the person watching her has to be let in on what those things.", "NAH. You did nothing wrong but I can understand that your sister got the wrong impression of what you said if her daughter was talking about paying you back.", "NTA how else would a kid learn if an adult didn\u2019t tell them?", "nta she asked and you answered. she is a cute little kid.", "NTA\n\nDude, I would KILL for an uncle like you. I had to learn investing, mortgages, housing, money all on my own. So much time, money lost in the processes. I would have gladly asked for help especially 20 years ago? When I was 8? I would be much better off and would have thanked you tirelessly\u2026.", "NTA.  It's good for kids to know that things cost money, money is limited and needs to be earned.  Niece sounds earnest and adorable.  Parents need to lighten up.", "NTA!!!!   Not understanding finances is why so many people get behind on bills and why most 401k\u2019s are under funded. \n\nWanting money is part of the drive that people have to go to college and major in a subject for which you can get a good job.  And now niece is talking about ways to earn money!\n\nThey suggest you tell kids quite a bit about your family money and budget because most children don\u2019t  understand even how a debit card and credit card work.   They think you can always just get more money!  \n\nI spoke freely to my kids about how a 401k works and even about the tax implications.  Now my kids were doing well and all are chunking away 10% into retirement accounts as well as having healthy emergency funds.  Sounds like your niece is asking questions which I think is amazing!", "How is this even a question. Literally everyone has the experience of a curious kid asking them questions. It is universal and natural.\n\nYou answered her questions. It's not like you gave her \"the talk\" or anything. She will have to learn about it eventually and she asked you about it.", "You're NTA.  We should always answer kids' questions as honestly as possible in an age appropriate manner. Your sister and her husband seem to be overreacting. It's not as though you explained reproduction to her.", "YTA for purposely confusing a child for no reason, she's eight just tell her she can only pick one thing.", "Thought the same thing too about being prepared to be adults.

How dumb do you think 8 year olds are?", "NTA\n\nObviously her parents haven't been providing her with enough financial literacy and boundaries based on your shopping trip.\n\nAt you niece's age, I showed my daughter my paycheck and all of our monthly bills and told her how much groceries, doctor appointments, and transportation costs were.\nShe learned that we needed balance between wants and needs.\n\nYou were acting as a loving uncle.", "She's the prime age for limonade stands and such. I was mowing lawns with my older brother at around 9.", "Thats totally irrelevant with him lecturing her on how expensive things like housing are.", "Literally things I've discussed with my 5 year old. An awareness of how the world works benefits children. Waiting until they're adults to explain how life works would be far worse.", "Not OPs place, they also clearly explained things poorly.", "How is that clear? And he was asked.", "NTA. Kids need to know that life costs someone money. \n\nWhen I take kids shopping, I learned to tell them that they are allowed to spend a set amount. I love watching my granddaughter go back and forth deciding what she wants most and adding the prices. That is healthier than buying kids everything.", "Your niece\u2019s reaction tells me that you had a really good, engaging conversation with her that she obviously appreciated. I think you and her have a great friendship ahead of you and you should spend more time with her. \n\nTo make her parents happy you can throw in a couple of child friendly comments that reinforce the fact that she\u2019s secure and doesn\u2019t need to worry. \n\n\nStuff like:\n\n\u201cYour mum and dad are so responsible it\u2019s great you don\u2019t have to worry about money at all. That\u2019s what looking after your money does; aren\u2019t they good!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really great thing your parents took advantage of being able to go to school and learn so they were able to choose careers that make them happy and financially secure!\u201d\n\nEtc etc.\n\nETA - NTA and your sister isn\u2019t really either, she just mum-reacted to her daughter sounding like she might be scared.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is mad because you actually connected with her daughter in a way she never has.

From what it sounds like, she probably has questions but her parents probably respond with \u201cdon\u2019t worry about it, you\u2019ll understand when you\u2019re older.\u201d And she\u2019s been content with that because that\u2019s all she knows.  Honestly, I worry about her future had you never talked to her about the basics. She would have grown thinking she just has luxury for the sake of living, then have a very nasty awakening moment when suddenly she\u2019s expected to get a job and mom and dad can\u2019t pay for everything so she has to work hard. I mean, maybe they wouldn\u2019t have let it go that far, but she\u2019s 8 years old! Children\u2019s shows talk about jobs and the basics of money now! Video games have their own economy! How does she not understand how money works by 8????\n\nNTA OP, and I think you did her a huge favor", "It is so important for kids to learn certain things early. Budgeting, respect, responsibility, accountability, self-care, hygiene, the list goes on. It's easier to learn as a kid and acquire good habits, too. Parents do a disservice to their children by not teaching these things. And you can make them kid-friendly (like hands to yourself, pick up your clothes, you did X chores and earned $Y, you put 30% to save for something later, you donate 10%, you have this much left for things you need and want, etc). Keeping them ignorant helps no one (other than the parent who may be too lazy to do these things)."]}
