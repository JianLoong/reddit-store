Our relationship with our neighbor Iris is polite but distant. Recently, Iris's son Tom moved in with her. We don't know much about him but exchange greetings when we see him. Trouble started this week.\n\nMy wife works from home full-time now due to the pandemic, while I have a hybrid schedule. On Monday, she called me to say that our dog was acting crazy and saw Tom climbing back over our garden fence. She was concerned, but didn't want to create unnecessary trouble, thinking he might be retrieving something for Iris. I agreed to let it go and asked her to inform me if it happened again.\n\nThe next day, the same thing occurred. My wife witnessed Tom wandering around our garden, knocking over furniture. I confronted him politely, expressing my concerns. He claimed he was retrieving his cat, but I reminded him that he should have informed us instead of trespassing. He apologized and promised to be more considerate.\n\nThe following day was uneventful, with no signs of Tom in our garden. However, the day after that, I moved my car to make it appear as if I wasn't home. As expected, the dog alerted me that someone was in the garden. I caught Tom in the act and lost my temper, warning him of police involvement if he repeated his actions. I also emphasized that our dog could pose a threat if she caught him. Feeling threatened, I decided to purchase some security cameras online (would take a few days to arrive)\n\nBack at the office the next day, my wife informed me that the dog was going crazy again and she spotted Tom in the garden. I instructed her to let the dog out to teach him a lesson. The dog chased Tom out, who shouted abuse at my wife, threatening to report us for having a dangerous dog. My wife defended herself, pointing out his repeated trespassing and lack of evidence. We decided to call the police to document the incidents.\n\nSome friends criticized my approach, fearing for my wife's and dog's safety. They argued that I should have considered the potential dangers. While I understand their concerns, I believe that my dog has the right to be in her own garden. Considering the suspicious behavior of a grown man targeting my wife when I'm not home, I felt justified in taking action. We installed visible security cameras as a deterrent, and I hope he realizes the consequences if he continues his actions.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1685788921, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13z8vob/aita_for_letting_the_dog_in_the_garden_when_the/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should have started a paper trail with the authorities as soon as he failed to stop after you addressed it.  \n\nI have a GSD. I would not bet on him NOT biting an intruder when I am not around, and then you have the problem of dangerous dog blabla. German Shepherds have an image problem as it is. \n\nEven more important: now he considers your dog a threat.  He sounds unhinged.

That would deter him trying to get inside again*", "Certainly NTA. Maybe you should plant some roses or other thorny, painful plant on your fence. I hope this creepy trespasser doesn't feed you dog anything harmful. I'd keep an eye on the pet whenever you put it outside. The camera is a great idea.

May want to consider leaving your dog out in your backyard for a few hours after you leave each day as well.  Thats the beauty of a good dog, there is no discussion, no semantics, no misunderstanding.

Call the police constantly.

Period.", "The dog is not going to get put down if she bites a trespasser in a already FENCED IN yard. She\u2019s protecting her territory and her family, but you\u2019re correct in the other statement. However if the dog jumped the fence and attacked someone, that\u2019s correct. But the guy is trespassing jumping over the fence into OP s yard. That makes OP and his dog correct. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes", "At this point its repeated behaviour, I would report it.

Your doing everything right. Next step would be filing a restraint order.", "NTA. How infuriating. *\u201cMy boy is a good boy. He just got home from jail/rehab for the 5th time.

I'd have the German Shepherd out there all the time until he got the message to stay out.", "sorry i missed that. original post said it was the neighbor lady's son", "To let the dog out the wife has to open the door,  he will now be expecting that and may use that as an opportunity to get in the door", "NTA then. But I would be damn sure of the law before I risked my dog's life to annoy a stupid neighbor.", "Threat or not dog laws are generally very different than human defense laws. I don't know your region of the world but here, Owners are meant to have full control of their animal or have a barrier that works. Just be careful and consider your options.", "You understand this entirely depends on where all this is happening right?\n\nMany places have laws that'll take away your dog if it bites a human.\n\nNot to mention if someone gets attacked by a dog, their instincts can easily be to fight back and humans can easily seriously injure a dog. \n\nThere are risks here and I wouldn't personally take with a loved family dog and I am hoping to get that across.", "The police told me that if a trespasser is on my property and the dog attacks it, that I'd facing no charges. It is not something I will be doing again now I have the cameras installed. Also, the fence is big. That's why I assumed he was climbing it because a kid would not be able to climb over it easily.", "Oh of course I understand, but, I\u2019m thinking you\u2019re entirely correct in possibly the dog getting hurt, that would be heartbreaking \ud83d\udc94. But, if someone trespassing on your fenced in yard coming on your property, the dog is defending you and your property.. so I hope the dog doesn\u2019t get put down for that!", "They may be correct, but I would take anything that police tell you about the law with a grain of salt.", " NTA for letting the dog out. One policeman\u2019s opinion is not all policemen\u2019s opinion nor the judgement of the court if some attorney your neighbor hired because of a dog bite sues. Okay, that was my TED talk. If anything, I think you should be taking strong actions legal actions against an repeat trespasser who is up to no good.", "Mhmm I completely agree the OP and dog wouldn't be in the wrong like due to own property ect ect but legal or unexpected realities can still punish those who didn't deserve it and it's important to understand the risks."]}
