My reason to live this way is that money provides you less stress, so good savings can bring you some peace of mind and allow to comfront unexpected/difficult situations better. Also, I have read enough posts here about how having a house/child is terrible expensive and I have the dream of one day actually settling down, so I am preparing in my overall health (mental, physical and financial) for it. \n\nHe also taugh  me about being a good provider for the family, so I try to be reliable offering financial support to family and friends when needed (I am known as the \"folk's bank\"). \n\nSo I totally get you. I had one of this comfrontations once (with my dad and my uncle in a family lunch). They started talking shit about me, comparing me with a cousin who has a nice car/house/family. I was pissed off at they mocking me, so I told them that: 1)she does not have a good car/house because they can afford them. They live well above their real means, so they have enormous debt while I am not,  and 2) I kinda flexed  how much earned in a day, so I could choose to work a week a month a be settled (but I work my ass off the whole year, no vacations, because I like my work and get anxious when not working/studying).\n\nThey were really upset about how I answered and called me a liar. I had to show them all my taxes documents and my current contract for them to shut up because they went off as I was a pathological liar living in a fantasy.\n\nMy dad apologized later because he thought I was broke as I didnt pay my student loans yet. I told him that I had applied to have a reduced payment plan so I was waiting for the goverment to announce some news about it. But I also show him my investments, that could easily pay the debt in one go just with the interests.\n\nHe apologized again and asked about my life choices so I told him my reasons. He said they wereunderstandable and that was a shame that he didnt listen to me or asked questions about my work. I told him that it was all good but he shouldnt talk shit about things he didnt know.

Now we have paid off our house and sold that one for a tidy profit and bought and paid off a bigger house. \n\nYou are smart enough to live within the means the support you comfortably.

Your parents started it by talking disparagingly about you in front of their guests and you may have gone overboard in your response which creates an awkward situation for everyone. Parties are not the time to air family grievances.  You could have corrected them without getting angry and changed the subject.\n\nTalk to your parents about it and own your part in the situation but explain they should be embarrassed, for making assumptions about your life without asking you first but more importantly for belittling you and misinforming people about your financial situation, which is no one's business but your own.  Really, even if you were struggling, their behavior is so out of line. Ask them why they would do that to you.  They need to treat you with respect.

A tiny studio, crappy car and back to work? It\u2019s scary how the world changed. I lived in Paris on minimum french salary and I was ok. In Geneva I am poor", "No, they embarrassed themselves by acting like asses.  NTAH here.", "NTA. They fucked around and found out.", "NTA. What parents cares about what their child makes? In my opinion, as long as they\u2019re safe, not spouting ridiculously and seem to be managing themselves well, it doesn\u2019t matter if there\u2019s 4 0\u2019s or 5.", "NTA. You told them how much you earn as they pushed you into a corner by talking negatively about you *again*. \n\nLike you, I live well within my means. I never worry about my expenses and I always have $$ in the bank for things like taxes, car damage (I live in the US) and other assorted unexpected issues.\n\nI never pay for or charge things that are out of my budget and I plan things within my budget. It is LOVELY living within your means. I have nevemr feel deprived.\n\nI am sorry your parents are hung up on the \"Let's show our neighbors how well of we are\" mindset. You deserve better. \n\nI have 2 kids and one of them \"gets me\" and he has been stashing money in the bank since he was 12. His sister - not so much. Yet, it doesn't surprise the kids at all when I can pony-up and pay for something expensive for someone - or myself. \n\nGo figure. Families are tough, prolly tougher than finances, then you mix then together and POW! Fireworks! I wish you the best.", "NTA\n\nThey were mean to you all the time and then misrepresented you to others.", "NTA \n\nI dont understand why anyone other than you and your significant other (if you have one or not,  I speed read and forgot lol) needs to know your income. Financial information is confidential.. unless you're asking them for money, they don't need to know.", "This is definitely a good warning that OP needs to prepare for!", "NTA- but I want to know where you (and others on this thread) live where $100,000 is rich. Because my partner and I make a MUCH more than that combined and we are living paycheck to paycheck. (we live in CA.)", "NTA. Obviously!\n\nAnd OP, you sound like a wonderful person with a good head on your shoulders. Sensible with money, care about the less fortunate... Oh, and good at what you do for a living! OP, you rule!\n\nLive long and prosper :-)", "NTA... they seem to care more about money and looking good than anything. You don't have to apologize, they literally are uninterested parents for not knowing anything about you beyond appearances.", "Nta you are smart.", "\ud83d\udc90=\ud83e\udea3", "Nta.\nThey deserved the embarrassment for how they tried the same on them.\nTurn about is fair play \n Good on you. But be ready for your family to start asking for money.", "NTA.  They're mad at you for \"embarrassing\" them but they don't understand that they embarrassed you by bringing up the subject and \"lamenting\" your choices.  How hypocritical is that!?  On principle, I never tell anyone, not even my parents, how much money I make.  It's nobody's business and if people know, it merely opens you up to further criticism if they don't agree with what you do with your money, or stirs up feelings of jealousy and resentment if they are not as fortunate.", "NTA", "NTA \nIf you listen to rich dad , poor dad you have a rich person attitude to money and they have a poor persons needing to keep up appearances.  Stay as you are living below your means", "ESH. They made incorrect assumptions and publicly judged you on these. You stuck up for yourself, but perhaps not in the most productive manner.", "Heh. Over here in Canada, a person in their 20s renting their own 2br apartment close to work AND having a car is living pretty well. NTA", "It\u2019s INSANE looking around at what people drive these days here in Toronto.

I hear the Joneses are getting a summer home is Ibiza, we should get a summer home\"", "They literally are uninterested parents for not knowing anything about you beyond appearances.", "I would go with \"spendthrift\" personally. Because they tried to embarrass OP about not being as visibly \"wealthy\" as they are, even though they have less where it actually matters (in the bank for emergencies and in investments for the future)."]}
