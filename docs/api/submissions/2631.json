It was typical of what you hear from people like her, she\u2019s going to hell, she\u2019s not normal, she needs to be baptized and see a priest, had her go to church multiple times a week, blocked all girls from her phone, outed her to people in her family, told people in church,  gone as far as to send her paragraphs when she was at school reminding her not to look at girls, she\u2019s crazy, and more, this isn\u2019t all either x \n\nI hadn\u2019t known this until she slipped up, I divorced her immediately and my daughter now lives with me full time and she only gets visits no sleepovers, no staying at her house and she has pretty much no right to violet. \n\nAnyways I\u2019ve met my daughters now girlfriend and she comes over frequently, at this time she was going to come over a little later and stay for the weekend and I drop her off. \n\nHowever I got a surprise visit from my daughters mom, it was 2 hours before so I told her she can only stay for an hour. She agreed and they talked  for a little while. \n\nThen her girlfriend ended up coming much earlier than I expected and her mom was still here. \n\nI told her that she needed to go, and that we will *plan* a visit sometime soon, but I guess she had other plans and said no that she wanted to meet and my kids face said a lot.  I told her that this is a conversation for another day. \n\nShe said that she hasn\u2019t done anything like she did before and she earned the right to meet who her daughter is with. \n\n I said she shouldn\u2019t have done it at all and she doesn\u2019t have a right to be here unannounced and she\u2019s lucky she got that. \n\nShe said that I am \u201cholding her past against her\u201d and I\u2019m not allowing her to prove that she\u2019s willing to put her religous facts, behind her. \n\nAll I said was this is not how we are doing this, and she isn\u2019t entitled to anything and is in no position to be making demands. \nWe went back and forth with her saying she\u2019s never going to be allowed to prove herself to violet and me saying she needs to try and be a mom to her instead of thinking proving herself is just supporting her sexuality alone. \n\nShe did leave, and I\u2019ve told this to a few of my family member and they\u2019ve said that she deserves to at least prove she can support her. \n\nWhile yes at some point she does at this moment wasnt a good time and I would like to sit both of them down including her girlfriends parents before moving forward, and I feel like her thinking just by meeting the girl is a way to prove herself isn\u2019t ideal. \n\nAlthough I know this is what I feel was in my kids best interest knowing her progression, was I wrong for this ?", "created_utc": 1668776505, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yyjjvv/aita_for_telling_my_exwife_to_leave_because_my/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The only thing is add is you should probably speak to your daughter about it, just the two of you, to decide together how to proceed with falling with the mom. She's old enough to get a say in that.", "NTA - you did what was best for your daughter. When/if her mother wants to 'prove' herself, it should be on your daughters terms, not when the mother decides on a whim. \n\nThe fact she doesn't see this makes me question if she really has changed. Why would she deliberately put her daughter in a position like that? It's completely shelfish and unfair. \n\nI'm really glad your daughter has such an accepting and level headed parent as you because her mother sounds like an awful role model and I genuinley question, from what I've read at least, if she will ever prove otherwise.", "NTA\n\nYou were protecting your daughter and her gf from someone who has a proven tendency to be extremely hateful to those in the LGBT+ community. \n\nEx-wife needs to be respectful of everyone\u2019s boundaries if she genuinely wants a chance to prove herself. And showing up unannounced and throwing a temper tantrum is not the way to show that she has changed and can be trusted to behave appropriately.", "NTA. I think it should be up to Violet when and if exwife meets her partner.", "You were protecting your kid, NTA. I\u2019m so please Violet has you in her corner", "NTA.\n\nYou stood up for your daughter and her girlfriend, and prevented them from being berated by your ex wife. \n\nGood on ya", "NTA. She doesn't get to dictate the terms of her redemption.", "NTA. While I do belive she deserves a chance your right a surprise visit is not the time. Your daughters girlfriend and you daughters deserve warning before just in case it doesnt go well.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing. You protected your daughter and you should absolutely hold your ex's past against her. She deliberately was hiding it from you because she knew it was wrong.\n\nShe is your ex now. She does not get to demand a relationship with anyone. She has to wait until everyone else decides they want one with her.", "NTA-new year new me, doesn\u2019t fly. Best to keep those kind of people at arms length and when your daughter is ready to reconnect she can.", "NTA-If she is really willing to put her religious facts behind her, and everything in me doubts this is true, and wants to support Violet she should know direct confrontation is not the way to do it. You did what was best for your child.", "NTA I think you did well. Maybe have a sit down with the ex about boundaries and if she really wants to prove herself she can do so, but on YOUR terms.", "NTA.   Ex lost her right to contact with violet on her terms.  IMO you are handling a potential meet exactly the way it should go.   In the future if ex shows up uninvited, it might be better for you and violet if she isn't allowed into the house.", "NTA. You're right. Spur of the moment visits are not the right time to address this kind of situation. I sincerely hope she has changed. But time and place is a thing, with everyone's consent. \n\nYou all can schedule a family meeting together if you wish or possibly if you feel may benefit, have a group therapy session in a safer environment. \n\nNTA OP. Kudos to you for looking after your daughter and her girlfriend.", "NTA.  Your exwife wasn't invited to your home, so you can tell her to leave for *any* reason.  If she refuses to leave, in the US you can call the police and report her for trespassing.  If she continues you can get a restraining order to get ex-wife to stay away.\n\nYou are one fantastic dad.  You are accepting Violet and her choices - huge win! and protecting Violet from haters - like her mother.  Big Win #2!", "NTA you can\u2019t trust homophobes, they\u2019ll say they changed but still say extremely ignorant and harmful/hateful things out of nowhere all under the guise of \u201cbeing supportive\u201d. My moms been a lot like that. It\u2019s very suspicious that she was so insistent, and that that\u2019s how she wants to prove herself. I think you made the right choice. If you allowed her to stay it may have ended up horribly with her forcing her homophobic religious beliefs onto the girls and causing some type of scene, or even just passive aggressive behavior that would still have negative effects. It\u2019s extremely hard being lgbt youth, especially when you have an unsupportive parent. Your daughter is lucky to have you in her life supporting her.", "NTA. Quite the opposite, sounds like you're a very supportive parent. Kudos OP.", "Now I'm just curious of what chapter one of this here manga played out.\n\nHow did you two end up entwined to begin with.", "NTA, you did the absolute right thing. You\u2019re protecting your daughter. You\u2019re an awesome dad and more LGBTQ+ kids need more awesome parents like you.", "NTA she will.not change, like a switch.

Proving she was trying to be a better mom would have been bowing out gracefully when you asked her to leave.", "NTA. If she\u2019s ready to demonstrate change, she can set up a scheduled, structured time to visit and meet the people in your child\u2019s life. This was about your ex, not about your child. And that kind of self-centered thinking is how you know there hasn\u2019t been much change at all.", "NTA. You protected your daughter and her GF. You're never an AH for protecting kids.  \n\nAnd you're right, if she wants an opportunity to \"prove\" herself, you absolutely should discuss it beforehand with all parties, kids don't deserve to be ambushed with that drama in their own house. If your kid doesn't want to give her mom the opportunity to mess up again, respect that and tell her mom to shove off.", "NTA! It should be up to violet and her SO if and when she meets violets mom and it should almost be in a public place to hopefully encourage the \u201cmom\u201d to not make a scene.", "NTA \n\nIf she wants to prove she's changed and wants to show she supports violet, then she should know turning up unannounced and refusing to leave isn't the way to do it.\n\nIt wasn't part of your custody/visitation agreement. She can't just demand to be let in after all the damage and hurt she caused violet. She needs to regain violets trust before anything else, let alone meeting her girlfriend, which is also for violet to decide.\n\nNext time, unless agreed first, don't let her in.", "NTA.\n\nI think that, if your daughter is open, its fine to give her a chance to show that she has changed.  But she doesn't get to spring that on her like this.  This is a situation where everyone involved has to be open to it and know what is happening going in, not ambushing people.", "NTA. You said it yourself, your daughter didn't want her to stay. The way to rebuild trust isn't by breaking boundaries (or the custody agreement) it's by respecting them.", "INFO- has your ex taken any steps to address her previous behavior? Apologies, therapy, recognition of wrongness?", "I was *going* to say ESH. But as I read along you\u2019re protecting your daughter, you\u2019re a very supportive dad. Definitely NTA because you\u2019re willing to mediate progression with her mom, not close her out completely. You\u2019re probably going to have a very strong relationship with your daughter in her adult years, and any partners she has.", "NTA\n\nYou were protecting your daughter. Her girlfriend doesn\u2019t need to face any bigotry that might slip out of her mouth. It also needs to be a discussion with full permission from your daughter first. Because it\u2019s her trauma, her ptsd.", "NTA. In the greater framework of your daughter and her moms relationship, maybe she should get an opportunity to repair. However, that should be spoken about with your daughter first. And the daughter should get to decide what allowances within reason the mom should get that are approved by you. Meeting the girlfriend first is not the way. Daughter should have input if her mom should be allowed to meet her. Gf\u2019s parents should be asked just in case there\u2019s a chance mom goes off the rails.", ">and my kids face said a lot.\n\nThis is the most important part. If Violet doesn't want her mother to meet her girlfriend, then that's it. The end. You are NTA and your ex wife can fuck right off.", "NTA.\n\nYou don't demand rights like this, you earn them. She's trying to skip earning them by being strident.", "NTA. The daughter needs to decide what type of relationship she wants with her if that is something she is even remotely interested in. You are protecting your daughter from an adult who has already shown she is capable of hurting her.", "NTA, you handled this perfectly.\n\nMake sure Violet knows she controls everything regarding her relationship with her mother moving forward. Assure her you won't force anything, and it goes at a pace that Violet, not anyone else, is comfortable with.\n\nFor what it's worth, I saw one good point from her mother - she did leave (even if it took too long). It means she accepted at least that. I can't say for sure whether she'll come around and be the mother that Violet deserves, but there may be some hope. Keep the boundaries firm at all times though, too many people like her have no problem lying to get their way.", "NTA.", "NTA and I would love every non-straight child have a parent like you. Lucky Violet. Reading this made me teary-eyed. Thank you for being so fierce and protecting your little girl.", "Nta. And please please please do not ever let your daughters get her alone by herself, I shudder to imagine the damage that can happen. As a back and forth christian myself it's Aholes like these that give us a bad name and made me leave the church. Amazing father", "NTA. Protecting your child is never the wrong thing to do.", "Agreed with this. I\u2019m a father of a young daughter and I\u2019m taking notes over here on how to Dad.", "And Violet's gf! And it should be planned. She can't prove she's done with her \"past behavior\" by showing up unannounced and demanding things be her way. She's already caused too much damage to let her go free range.", "And call the police to have her removed for trespassing! Don't continue a completely pointless (unless the point is stess and discomfort) verbal arguement. Do NOT allow her in the house if she shows up unscheduled, call the cops if she won't leave the FIRST. TIME. YOU. ASK.", "she\u2019s apologized, though it was just an \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d not really recognizing she was wrong, she still believes everything before (hence her saying religous *facts*) she doesn\u2019t have a therapist.", "So she hasn\u2019t. \n\nWith no indication of change and no attempts to correct her behavior she is entitled to jack diddly. \n\nMay want to walk the flying monkeys though that thought pattern. \n\nNTA.
