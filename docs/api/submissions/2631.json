If you allowed her to stay it may have ended up horribly with her forcing her homophobic religious beliefs onto the girls and causing some type of scene, or even just passive aggressive behavior that would still have negative effects.

Your ex doesn't get to demand access to anyone with \"I get to prove I've changed!\" No she doesn't. She deliberately and maliciously caused irreparable harm. If she's sorry, she can do better going forward with people who are comfortable being around her. Starting by refusing to leave when asked and demanding (not asking) for access to children she already has a history of abuse around is a sign she has *not* changed and shouldn't be trusted.

She shows up announced (rude), refuses to leave (ruder) and makes it your problem that you won't do what she wants in that exact moment. \n\nHere's how this should have gone: She calls you and says she feels that over the last year she has done a lot of work to show she has changed, and would like to meet her daughter's girlfriend. You say that is up to your daughter, but you will speak to your daughter and get back to her. Then you do that, if your daughter is open to it, you set the terms of the meeting, ex shows up and follows the rules, has a lovely visit, and we have one more step towards trust and acceptance. \n\nWanting forgiveness and access on demand demonstrates your ex hasn't learned a single lesson since you left her.", "NTA.  She does not get to just waltz back in like that.  Your kid deserves to feel safe above all else.  Until your daughter, the one who was wronged here, feels safe, your job is to enforce that, even if it means that your ex never sees her again.\n\nRemember, this was not a mistake.  This was a series of deliberate actions borne from your ex thinking her way of life is so superior that she justified traumatizing your daughter to herself.  This was your ex failing your daughter so severely that your only choice was to divorce her.\n\nI\u2019m all for second chances, but not when there\u2019s an inherent power imbalance, and certainly not when the one who screwed up can\u2019t accept the consequences gracefully and expects to just come back in.", "You got me at \"religious facts\". 100% NTA. You are a great dad.", "Member of the LGBT+ community here, and you 100% did the right thing. Amazing parenting!

Like, obviously your ex *was* a total asshole to your daughter before and I completely understand your impulse to protect your daughter from a possible blow-up.  Your daughter is the priority here, and you are completely correct to treat her as the priority.  You seem to be doing a good job of dad-ing.\n\nAt the same time, many people do learn to come around on this topic, especially when they've seen dire consequences as a result of their bad behavior.  If your daughter's girlfriend is an especially nice person, meeting her might be really good for your ex, who probably hasn't had many interactions with gay people other than your daughter.  Meeting one who makes her daughter happy could be a watershed moment for her, which could in turn lead to healing for your daughter.  I also see your ex's concern that she's never going to get a chance to do right by your daughter. She's completely at your mercy here and doesn't know if you'll give her a chance.\n\nTo swing back in the other direction, you also are completely correct that an accidental, impromptu meeting was the wrong way to try for an introduction.  Asking your daughter's girlfriend to stand in for every gay person is an *enormous ask*, just a ton of pressure to put on someone who's done nothing to deserve that kind of monumental burden.  Even if meeting her would be good for your ex and even if healing this rift would ultimately be good for your daughter, that's gotta be the kind of situation that everyone involved has plenty of time to think about in advance and the choice to opt out of it.\n\nI would suggest you have a frank discussion with your daughter about what she wants.  Does she want her mom to meet her girlfriend?  Does she want to give her mom the chance to show that she's turned over a new leaf?  Does she want to try to start healing their relationship?  If she wants all those things, and if her girlfriend is willing to attend, it would be a good idea to set up a meeting for the expressed purpose of introducing the girlfriend.

Your like Dad of the year good sir. And I'll echo what some others are saying, there is a good chance your ex is spying on your daughter and planned this.

She broke Violet's trust by outing her to both family AND strangers. She had no right to do that.\n\nYou said that when your ex said she wanted to meet Violet's gf you said that Violet's face said a lot.

I had a very similar thing happen to me when I came out. I'm pansexual ftm transgender, and when I came out I was told the whole 'youre going to hell', 'youre possessed', 'theres something wrong with you' etc. I was outed to my entire (far right wing conservative christian) family. I was brought for an exorcism. I was forced to attend therapy with christian councellors etc that told me I was messed up etc. I never saw a therapist when I actually needed to (as in I have severe anxiety, depression, bpd/did, and ptsd. Never saw a doctor for that. But the moment I come out? Bro lol.)\n\nI did end up getting kicked out. I currently live in a motel room on disability.
