Your ex doesn't get to demand access to anyone with \"I get to prove I've changed!\" No she doesn't. She deliberately and maliciously caused irreparable harm. If she's sorry, she can do better going forward with people who are comfortable being around her. Starting by refusing to leave when asked and demanding (not asking) for access to children she already has a history of abuse around is a sign she has *not* changed and shouldn't be trusted. And she started using hyperbolic language when you were offering perfectly reasonable opportunities for her to sit down and discuss it and how she can prove she has changed following and respecting the boundaries of the people she hurt once already and who would be risking her hurting again. \"I'll **never** get to prove myself to violet!\" She had her chance. She blew it as badly as possible which is why neither you nor your daughter fell safe around her anymore. If she wants a second chance that's something that is everyone else's choice involved, not hers.

She shows up announced (rude), refuses to leave (ruder) and makes it your problem that you won't do what she wants in that exact moment. \n\nHere's how this should have gone: She calls you and says she feels that over the last year she has done a lot of work to show she has changed, and would like to meet her daughter's girlfriend. You say that is up to your daughter, but you will speak to your daughter and get back to her. Then you do that, if your daughter is open to it, you set the terms of the meeting, ex shows up and follows the rules, has a lovely visit, and we have one more step towards trust and acceptance. \n\nWanting forgiveness and access on demand demonstrates your ex hasn't learned a single lesson since you left her.", "NTA.  She does not get to just waltz back in like that.  Your kid deserves to feel safe above all else.  Until your daughter, the one who was wronged here, feels safe, your job is to enforce that, even if it means that your ex never sees her again.\n\nRemember, this was not a mistake.  This was a series of deliberate actions borne from your ex thinking her way of life is so superior that she justified traumatizing your daughter to herself.  This was your ex failing your daughter so severely that your only choice was to divorce her.\n\nI\u2019m all for second chances, but not when there\u2019s an inherent power imbalance, and certainly not when the one who screwed up can\u2019t accept the consequences gracefully and expects to just come back in.", "You got me at \"religious facts\". 100% NTA. You are a great dad.", "Member of the LGBT+ community here, and you 100% did the right thing. Amazing parenting!  NTA", "NTA Your ex-wife shows that it is still her way or the highway regardless of whether she's overcome her homophobia and bigotry.

There's a high change that she wants to meet the girlfriend to harass her into \"stop tempting\" your daughter or some similar  bullshit", "NTA. She was up to something, I think.

Like, obviously your ex *was* a total asshole to your daughter before and I completely understand your impulse to protect your daughter from a possible blow-up.  Your daughter is the priority here, and you are completely correct to treat her as the priority.  You seem to be doing a good job of dad-ing.\n\nAt the same time, many people do learn to come around on this topic, especially when they've seen dire consequences as a result of their bad behavior.  If your daughter's girlfriend is an especially nice person, meeting her might be really good for your ex, who probably hasn't had many interactions with gay people other than your daughter.  Meeting one who makes her daughter happy could be a watershed moment for her, which could in turn lead to healing for your daughter.  I also see your ex's concern that she's never going to get a chance to do right by your daughter. She's completely at your mercy here and doesn't know if you'll give her a chance.\n\nTo swing back in the other direction, you also are completely correct that an accidental, impromptu meeting was the wrong way to try for an introduction.  Asking your daughter's girlfriend to stand in for every gay person is an *enormous ask*, just a ton of pressure to put on someone who's done nothing to deserve that kind of monumental burden.  Even if meeting her would be good for your ex and even if healing this rift would ultimately be good for your daughter, that's gotta be the kind of situation that everyone involved has plenty of time to think about in advance and the choice to opt out of it.\n\nI would suggest you have a frank discussion with your daughter about what she wants.  Does she want her mom to meet her girlfriend?  Does she want to give her mom the chance to show that she's turned over a new leaf?  Does she want to try to start healing their relationship?  If she wants all those things, and if her girlfriend is willing to attend, it would be a good idea to set up a meeting for the expressed purpose of introducing the girlfriend.  But it's gotta be your daughter's choice, and not just an accident of fate.", "Maybe I hang out in this sub too much but does anyone else think it\u2019s weird the mom just swings by before the gf is supposed to come by?  And from my understanding, seems to know the gf is coming even tho OP doesn\u2019t mention to her why she needs to leave?\n\nOP, maybe just in case, you should see if there is any sort of parental/spy stuff on your daughters phone.", "If mom wanted to prove herself she should start by getting back in her daughters good graces not by dropping by for a visit unannounced anyway but it is\nDefinitely suspicious that she knew when the girlfriend was coming over", "And then they need to talk to the girlfriend and possibly her parents. I mean I assume both girls are underage. I would absolutely not care if my underage daughter was dating another girl but I would definitely want to know if they arranged for her to meet girlfriend's mother who was so homophobic her husband divorced her in order to keep their child safe. I would be worried about her saying terrible things to my daughter, or that she may even blame my daughter for her own child's sexuality and start a long drawn out game of harassment or something. I would definitely insist that it be public and you bet your ass I would be somewhere behind them with a newspaper with eyeholes, ready to interfere and take my underage kid out of there if I heard the other woman verbally attacking her or if I saw it devolve in a family drama circus that my daughter doesn't deserve to be a part of. And girlfriend herself may not be comfortable. She is her own person not a means for estranged mom to prove that she changed. Just because she is dating OP's daughter doesn't mean she will be comfortable meeting her girlfriend's openly homophobic family members.", "Not just that, but nowhere in that post did OP indicate that Violets mom apologized for her verbal abuse, and she thinks she just gets a free pass to demand meeting Violets gf? FOH with that, she can't claim she's changed without acknowledging how horrible she was before. You're a good parent OP, looking out for your daughters best interests like you should \ud83d\udc4f", "Well until the \"religious facts\" changes to \"religious opinions\" I'd say the answer is no, no matter what the reconciliation mechanism is.", "In this conversation no. She has apologized before but not really \u201cI\u2019m sorry I understand I was wrong\u201d since she still believes these are facts", "\u201cThe look on my daughters face said it all\u201d at that time she did nit\n\nOf course it\u2019s up to her however, her mother still believes this, if the roles were reversed and her girlfriends parents brought my daughter around someone they knew was very discriminatory, and something bad happened, I would not be happy. \n\nSo while of course what my daughter says goes but I do have to make sure all parties consent to this as I really have no clue how this will turn out.", "\u201cThen her girlfriend ended up coming much earlier than I expected and her mom was still here.\u201d", "Completely agree. Until the ex-wife has given Violet a genuine apology (meaning clearly identifying what behavior was wrong, taking full responsibility for that behavior, and expressing complete apologetic remorse) then she hasn\u2019t shown that she deserves to move beyond the repercussions of her abusive behavior. \n\nBut given that the ex-wife is still referring to her horrendous stance as \u2018religious facts\u2019\u2026I\u2019m not sure that she\u2019s anywhere close to being capable of a genuine apology. \n\nOP is addressing everything with his daughter\u2019s best interest at the forefront\u2026he\u2019s being a phenomenal father. I just hope that the rest of the family recognises that he\u2019s not stonewalling his ex or trying to be difficult\u2026he\u2019s merely taking precautions to protect his daughter (and her gf).", "Oh hell I thought that was autocorrect run amok.  She still believes this trash?  And thinks if she keeps her mouth shut you\u2019ll let her back in?  Goddesses above, no.  She\u2019s still hateful, she just thinks being nice about it will get her points.", "I see. In that case, fuck her. NTA"]}
