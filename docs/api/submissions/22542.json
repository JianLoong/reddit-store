We got married in Helen, Ga, about 2 hours away from us. My dress was $590 after tax and alterations, our venue in Helen was $500, immediate family ONLY, food at the Troll Tavern (where hubby wanted to go) was $260, and a hotel room outside Helen was $80 for the night. We went back the following weekend for our honeymoon and spent about $3000 mostly to stay at one of the best hotel rooms (Castle Inn) and for food. About $300 was spent on gifts/mementos/souvenirs. \n\nIf my MIL and FIL could've spared $1500 (which would've been half the cost of our trip), I would've been very appreciative.

You for your reaction. I can understand the disappointment, but honestly, I don\u2019t know why you didn\u2019t think something was up when fil kept delaying. It think it\u2019s beyond weird to be expecting a honeymoon but know there is nothing booked so close to the date. I feel like you proactively could have done something.\n\nSince timing seems to be a factor, if you think you and your partner can still have a good trip I would take the 1500 and treat it as a loan, and pay back the FIL at your earliest convenience. But if you think this vibe is going to carryover, I would delay the honeymoon, because it would just be wasted money.\n\nThis needs to be squashed, unfortunately, pretty quick.

If they want ANYTHING at all it should be at their own expense. They're just beggars now", "Nursing school is intense. It\u2019s better not to work if at all possible. He\u2019s hardly freeloading.", "Entitled for not being able to afford rent? Lol.", "Probably gaming on his computer 12 hours a day, and telling his wife, but he\u2019s been studying", "Right because they\u2019ll resent her", "If they said they'd pay then I think it makes sense she's asking about reservations - wouldn't you want to know that your hotel, car, whatever was locked in and where exactly it was? If they couldn't pay they should have told them things have changed. Also, it sounds like he's offering the $1500 after she got upset. I can totally understand wanting to say no in the moment, like the husband said, out of pride.\n\nNTA\n\n\n\nEdited, grammar and judgement", "Three years ago would've been summer 2020.\n\nI can't recall, wasn't there something going on in summer 2020 that would've made it tough to set up/hold a wedding ceremony?", "She kept asking them to make reservations because the date of the trip *they said they'd pay for* was coming up.", "Awww those long happy marriages give one hope!\n\nBoth my husband's and my parents had shitty relationships, witg messy divorces and a lot of resentment. So we try to do better!", "Then say it from the start, don't go back on your word, especially when it's too late for OP to prepare for it.", "The FIL decided to go on the trip and decided to pay for some of it. That was all on the FIL, they didn't ask him to come, he just wanted to. They didn't ask him to pay for it, he just wanted to. Nowhere did OP say that they asked FIL to come or to pay for the trip.", "He, again, offered to pay for a trip he joined as a third wheel. He offered to pay for another trip. He made that decision himself, no \"shouldn't\" about it.", "Agreed!", "I would be fine with it, because a paid-for trip is a paid-for trip. He's still offering to give them $1500, which would pay for a good chunk of their long weekend honeymoon a few towns over.", "I don't even have any friends who had their parents pay for their honeymoon, so it's not just my family. Paying for the wedding is expensive enough, so families don't need to also pay for the honeymoon.", "I paid for my wedding and honeymoon. Dad paid for my dress to be cleaned because I got a free one and got a little tight near the end. I kept the cost way down. The day of my wedding, my dad gave me half the cost back. Me spending less = him giving me more. By chance, the other guests covered the rest and we broke even. \n\nCheck it out: a different way for a different family.", "You should still be paying for your own honeymoon", "Have you checked your savings to see if you have any left? You may want to see if your husband has been using your savings to find his old lifestyle\u2026", "What stopped them from talking to him in person and looking at reservations with him? Even if someone else was paying, I'd like to be involved in where we were staying. I can't imagine asking my in-laws to just pick a hotel for us. Yes he's offering the money after she got upset, which he didn't have to do because he already paid for a recent trip. There's a good chance that he just can't afford it right now, so they might have to wait a little bit longer before taking a honeymoon.", "I know people who had wedding plans in 2020 and had to postpone. Several of them still got legally married, and then had a full ceremony and reception 2-3 years later. Do you know what they did? They spent that time saving money to get the wedding and honeymoon they really wanted.", "Don't just ask someone to make reservations. Sit down with them and actually make the reservations together. If they refuse to do so after a couple of attempts, then you should realize that it's not going to happen and plan accordingly.", "They were high school sweethearts and got married right after college, and they still sometimes embarrassed us kids when they held hands lol. Oh, and every time one of them bakes anything with flour, they leave a handprint on the other's butt \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f It seemed gross when I was a kid, but as an adult it's sweet that they are still happy and playful with each other.     \n\nBut it sounds like you and your husband are breaking that cycle of unhappy marriages, so yay for you! Sixteen years is definitely an accomplishment! If my first husband was still alive, we'd be celebrating our 13th anniversary this year. My second husband and I are only coming up on our 4th, but hopefully there are many more!", "I agree with you there, but he is still wanting to give them $1500 for a honeymoon gift. They're only going a few towns over, so it's not like they need to book flights or rental cars. It's just a hotel for three nights plus whatever food and entertainment they want. That money should cover the hotel, and they can use whatever they would've spent on the previous trip to cover the rest of it.", "The 1500 is after telling them they're SOL....then it seems he had the change of heart and offers the money.  Sounds like the bride is just angry after being told one thing then another then another.  I'd be cranky, too.", "You are really comparing a honeymoon trip to a trip with his father?", "Checking out a state you might move to with FIL and visiting SIL isn't at all the same as a honeymoon.\n\nFIL is TA.", "You're missing the entire point. Not paying for their kids honeymoon is perfectly fine. Saying you *will* pay for it and then backing out 2 days before the honeymoon is not ok.", "What are you on about? The husband\u2019s side paid for nothing at all because the plan was for them to pay for the honeymoon.", "Also, was this deal made before they moved in or after? OP may also have a child. Did that child happen after they moved in? \n\nAs far as the trip FIL did pay for, how entitled was op on the trip? Did they just expect FIL to pay rather than picking up their own tab? Did they order drinks and apps on someone else's dime? \n\nA lot could have happened in the time between any agreement and actual time to pay.", "We can only assume what OP said is true. Once you start assuming she's lying, then we can just start making up shit.\n\nMaybe she murdered her FIL and ate him! She's the asshole!", "She's LDS so probably not actually.", "OP did get legally married.\n\nAnd OP explicitly says they could've/would've saved for the honeymoon if FIL hadn't offered to pay for the honeymoon, and then changed his mind at the last minute. That's the issue here - OP relied on a promise from her FIL, only to get the rug pulled out from her at the last minute.", "Your parents sound adorable!!!\n\nI am sorry for your loss, but I am glad you have found love again!", "But would you turn down the $1500? Especially when you're living in his house and your husband doesn't work because he's in school? Even though you're also in school and have a job?", "Did they say they spent the whole trip with his father?", "They were going to that state anyway, so they had the money for it. FIL decided to go so he could see his daughter so he decided to pay for the trip for everyone. Why didn't they just use the money they didn't spend on that trip on their honeymoon? Money is money.", "It's also normal for parents not to pay for the wedding at all.", "But they're paying for the wedding?", "I know they got legally married, I didn't say otherwise. But unless they were having constant conversations about the honeymoon with FIL, then they should've been saving money. They don't even live on their own, so a honeymoon should be the last thing on their list of priorities. I think FIL has paid enough.", "Are you the Dad? Because dang you are really defending a shitty guy for what reaso?", "> Money is money.\n\nYeah and the little tidbit that you're conveniently ignoring is that a honeymoon is usually more expensive than a domestic trip.", "The issue is that when planning wedding and honeymoon FIL agreed to pay for the honeymoon. Because it was never booked, I don't think he intended to follow through.\n\nThen he used the excuse of paying for the trip he invited himself on to say he wasn't paying for the honeymoon."]}
