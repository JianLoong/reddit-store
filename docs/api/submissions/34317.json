My parents divorced, and my dad had custody for me every 2 weeks on the weekends. Eventually dad remarried to the girl he cheated on my mom with, making her my stepmom.\n\nMy stepmom is narcissistic and manipulative. When she moved in with my dad (about a year after the divorce), suddenly my \"dad\" invented a lot of rules for teenage me to follow that weren't problems before. (\"Dad\" is in quotes because I suspect my stepmom is responsible.)\n\nAmong these was mandatory \"family time\", where I would be forced to hang out with my dad, stepmom, and my 3 step-siblings from my stepmom's prior marriage. Usually we'd eat dinner at the table together and watch a movie, but rarely we'd go out to the zoo or a theme park or whatever. Sometimes we'd stay at a hotel and make it a multi-day thing.\n\nI didn't get along with my stepmom nor my step-siblings and hated these trips, but I was forced to go on them because my dad had custody of me. My stepmom always got mad that I wasn't enjoying myself, and over the years I developed a reputation of lying about being sick, lying about work, doing whatever to get out of it.\n\nEventually they stopped doing \"family time\" altogether about a decade ago. Now my step-siblings are scattered across the country. Both my step-sisters are married with small kids, while my stepbrother is in a long-term relationship (as am I).\n\nThis Christmas, we all got the same \"present\": my dad is paying for a trip to Walt Disney World for everyone. It was pitched as a revival of \"family time\" now that we never see each other. He's paying for everything - airfare, tickets, hotel, everything. All significant others and children are included, and he gave all of us $200 Disney gift cards to use as spending money. \n\nI ***really*** don't want to go.\n\nWhen I asked my fiance for her thoughts, she sees it as a free trip and is confused as to why I don't want to just accept an all-expenses-paid vacation. But she didn't have to spend large amounts of time dealing with this sort of thing like I did.\n\nI developed a... reputation for trying to weasel out of these events, and that doing so again would make my dad sad.\n\nMy dad recently had a heart attack (but recovered) and I want to spend time with him while he's still around. He and I haven't really hung out in years... but my stepmom follows him everywhere he goes and he isn't allowed to see me without her.\n\nI know he'd be very disappointed if I didn't go, and it would break my heart to hurt him like that when we don't know how long he has left.\n\nBut I felt so free the day I wasn't forced to participate in my stepmom's activities anymore, and when the trip was announced instead of feeling happy I felt dread, like I was a kid being forced to live under her roof again.", "created_utc": 1704379992, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18yez81/wibta_for_refusing_to_go_with_my_dad_on_a_free/", "score": 414, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your stepmom has so much control over him that he's prohibited from seeing you on his own?\n\nAnd he's ok with that?\n\nFrankly your dad sounds like a very weak man. Having said that, he IS still your dad and he may not be around that much longer. I would take him aside and explain that you would really love to spend some one on one bonding time with him.\n\nIf he still can't muster the courage to stand up to his wife...I would probably capitulate and go on the Disney trip (and, frankly, give the controlling stepmom the cold shoulder the whole time).\n\nHe may be weak but he's still your dad and he's the only one you're ever going to have.", "NTA\n\nIf you dont want to go, then don't.\nYou want to enjoy time with your dad, but when your stepmom is really like that, you are gonna to have a bad time.\nDid you explain that to your partner?\nDoes your dad know about your relation with your stepmom?", "NTA, Disney World would not be a vacation with these people. You\u2019ll probably have to follow their schedule, especially with small children, eat where they want and so on. Your poor father won\u2019t be able to sit and relax, like a person who had a heart attack should be doing. I worked there for years: the amount of family fights (by adults) was insanely high. Verbal and physical, I wouldn\u2019t put myself in this situation if I were you.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, you are way more forgiving than I would be. It takes 2 people to cheat, and while she may be pushing him around, he's also letting it happen. Forcing \"family time\" only makes things worse.\n\nAs an adult, you don't have to go anywhere you don't want to. I would sit down and talk with your fianc\u00e9e and dad. Explain why you don't like your SM and why the Disney kumbaya trip isn't something you're interested in.\n\nMaybe you and your Dad can do something alone together. Just because you don't want to be associated with them doesn't mean you can't make memories of just the two of you.", "NTA. Take your mom as significant other.", "Nta but have you told your dad any if this?", "NAH - Generally speaking your SM may be problematic (and may even generally be an AH), but in this specific situation I don't think anyone is truly being an AH. \n\nIf you really don't want to go, tell your dad that you appreciate the offer but the dates just don't work with your work schedule. Or you could be honest and tell him that while you would love to spend more time with him, a big family vacation sounds overwhelming and you would rather do a weekend trip just the two of you at a later date. \n\nI know you don't want to hurt his feelings, but your feelings matter too. It sounds like you have expressed to him in the past that you would like to spend more time with just him, and he has chosen to do what his wife wants instead. You should not always have to be the one who bends to maintain the relationship. It takes effort from both sides to maintain a relationship. While a all expenses paid trip is generous, its not necessarily thoughtful. \n\nThat being said. Disney is a very large place. Assuming you and your partner have your own room (and I would definitely confirm that), it would be easy enough for you two to spend most of the vacation just enjoying yourselves. And keep in mind that this will be different than it was when you were a teenager. For one thing, you will have your partner there to be you so you will have someone on your side. And you are an adult and cannot be forced into things you don't want to do. \n\nIf you decide to go, find a time to call your dad and tell him that it is really important to you that you two find some time during the trip to spend time together just the two of you. Even it is just meeting for coffee in the morning before the day's activities get started. You may even find that SM is busy helping with the grandkids and your dad has more freedom. (Just give your partner a heads up that she may have some alone time during the trip.)", "NTA for declining the invitation and returning the gift cards. Your father might be disappointed, but I'll bet he understands exactly why you're turning him down. If you want to spend time alone with your dad, you could invite him to a father-daughter dinner or something where it's clear it's just the two of you; if your stepmom insists on coming, you could cancel, even if that means canceling once you've already arrived at the restaurant. Be strong.", "You need to ask him a basic question. If he is allowed to see his step kids without his wife present or if his presence isn't mandatory when his wife sees her kids, then why is he not allowed to have one on one time with you? You are entitled to an honest answer from both of them.", "NTA - but you need to really sit down and have a talk with your Fiance AND your dad.   Tell him during the trip that you want at least an hour or two of just you two catching up and getting reacquainted.  If the trip is going to be the same old \"forced time together\" 100% you aren't interested.\n\nAlso, say that your SM can have alone time with her kids too while you and your dad are together.", "Point of clarification. She is not your step-mom, she is your father\u2019s wife. Go in with that attitude and you\u2019ll be better off.", "NTA, but that being said you really should have a talk with your dad about why it is that you really hate your step family", "See if you can arrange for a get together with JUST you and your dad to discuss the trip.  Be very clear this is about you two having some alone time.  If he, in fact, honors your request and comes alone have some time to catch up and talk honestly about your feelings about the trip and see if you can negotiate minimal contact with your steps during the trip and some one on one time with your dad.   \n\nIf step mom shows up with him--then just tell him his lack of respect for your needs means you won't be joining them on the trip and leave.  If he does come alone and you have a successful talk with some boundaries set then consider going.", "NTA but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in your own best interest to avoid the trip. \n\nI like what the other comment said about ensuring that you get some time alone with your dad.\n\nI think there are ways to discuss with your dad and arrange so that you can be away from your stepmom as much as possible.\n\nI think it\u2019s in your own best interest to try to be as zen as possible, do not get bothered by her, and enjoy spending time with your dad.", "NTA, and your fiance should  accept your answer.  If she values a free vacation over your feelings, that is a red flag.", "I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to go. I no longer have a relationship with my father for this reason. He would not spend any time with me that did not involve his wife. On top of that any phone calls were of him trying to guilt me for not wanting her in my life.. I gave up on the whole relationship and hold on to the good memories. NTA", "NTA because as an adult you are entitled to spend your time with folks you want to spend your time with! HOWEVER this trip would be a far cry from your forced \"family time\" as a child. You are no longer a child and your gf would be with you, and the 2 of you can decide together what group events you want to participate in and which ones you'll skip for an alternative activity or alone time. Your step siblings are also now adults, married with kids and you haven't seen them in years - they could behave totally different than when they were children under their mother's roof. Many kids of narcissistic mothers realize how f\\*up their parent is and take sincere measures NOT to follow in their footsteps. They may even now understand why you \"lied\" your way out of events! Your dad is older, in poor health and would be hurt if you didn't go, your gf wants to go and you MIGHT actually even have a good time. If it would really break your heart to hurt your dad, you will probably regret not going as this might be the last chance you get to spend time with your dad before he's gone. AND, if you can get any other male on board, arrange an activity where the \"guys\" and the \"gals\" split up so you could get a few minutes alone with your dad! So it's down to your choice of can you suck-up your SM's crappy  behaviour once more to spend what could be your last time with your dad, or does she get to tell him one last time how much of a f\\*up you are. You decide.", "NTA, but just upgrade your tickets to parkhoppers and ditch the fam when they get to be too much. The families with kids will want to head back to sleep early anyway, so you can still make it fun. I'm with your girlfriend.", "NTA either way but I think you need to really ask yourself, what are you going to regret more. Spending some time with people you don't like in order to also spend time with your dad (and let's be honest, it's Disney World, it's impossible not to at least have \\*some\\* fun over there even if there are also interactions you don't like.) Or, will you look back on this after your dad is no longer around and wish you'd spent the time with him?\n\nIt's entirely up to you. I don't think doing either makes you in any way a bad person. Maybe you can get the best of both worlds by speaking to your dad. In other comments you've mentioned that he's aware you don't get on with the step-family. Maybe instead of going on this trip, you could arrange another trip for just the two of you to go fishing or whatever?", "NTA and you should plan a trip with your dad alone.  You are an adult now and you don\u2019t have to kowtow to his wife; you have your own power now.  \n\nYou feel guilty for your \u201creputation\u201d for weaseling out but from the otherwise looking in - it\u2019s more that they knew you didn\u2019t want to go and forced you.  And they knew you wouldn\u2019t want to do this now and are trying to force you again.  \n\nDon\u2019t avoid your dad and don\u2019t let her box you out.  But you also don\u2019t need to fall into line and pretend now that you aren\u2019t forced.", "Nah\u2026 you don\u2019t have to go on any trips but you\u2019re an adult now. You are definitely letting childhood memories get in the way of making new adult ones. Maybe I\u2019m missing something, idk if your step siblings are actively mean to you, or do things for you to be unsafe, but honestly that sounds like a fun opportunity if your dad is having health struggles, and you hardly ever see ur step siblings anyways. Also cool you get to bring your fianc\u00e9 for free. \n\nMaybe talk to a therapist? Couldn\u2019t hurt. Good luck.", "While you are an adult and can do whatever it is you want to do in this situation, but know, you will be seen as the AH if you don't go.  While your dad had a heart attack and recovered from it - that doesn't mean the underlying problems that lead to him having a heart attack still aren't there.  As someone that recently lost a family member a few days ago put your differences aside for someone who you love and spend what time with him that you can - else you will regret it later.  That is, unless  you want nothing to do with him anymore and if that is the case, say so, and move on!", "Nta you should be able to be with your father alone. It\u2019s toxic that you can\u2019t do that and you shouldn\u2019t have to go on this trip to see him. Are you able to go to him and have this discussion with him that you want personal private time? If he really wants you in his life he won\u2019t force that your step mom has to be there.", "Your father is offering a gift and you are free to reject it.  I suggest instead you propose you and your father do something together some time which you both would enjoy without the rest of the extended family around.", "NTA - but why don\u2019t you suggest to your father that you join him on one of his wildlife photography trips up north instead? You state that his wife doesn\u2019t join him on these trips because she finds them boring. Your father might be overjoyed to have company and show you his hobby.\n\nIf you have already told him that you \u201cwill try\u201d to get the time off then he knows that that may be a problem for you so not being able to get the time off is already a known factor.", "NTA- Your father and SM should consider themselves lucky that you interact with them at all considering the circumstances and everything they\u2019ve put you through. I would have a real heart to heart with your father and put your foot down about having quality time with him away from his wife. I would also sit your partner down and really help them understand why this trip feels like a trap for you, and why you really don\u2019t want to go. If you don\u2019t go, don\u2019t let them make you feel guilty about it. If you do go, don\u2019t be afraid 2 set boundaries the best you can while you\u2019re there. (Disney is a big park, groups get separated all the time. Hint hint.\ud83d\udc40)", "NTA,\nBut if you can negotiate an acceptable amount of time during the trip just for the two of you, maybe consider doing it for your fiance. \n\nDisney World is crazy expensive and a heck of allot of fun and it sounds like she would enjoy it.", "NTA.  Talk to dad directly and tell him that while you appreciate the offer, that you don\u2019t want to go.  Be a grown up and don\u2019t make excuses.", "NTA, but if you want to see your dad make it clear you want to see only him.", "If you don't want to go and subject yourself to 'family' time, then don't. It doesn't matter how free the trip is if you'll be nothing but miserable at the 'happiest place on Earth'. \n\nYour GF seems to be stuck at the 'free vacation' part and isn't grasping all that comes with it. \n\nI would thank your dad for the offer, but tell him the *truth* why you don't want to go. You're not a child who can be forced to go or be punished for not going or not being happy enough anymore. This is where you learn to stand up for yourself and stop being pushed around.\n\nIf your dad's hurt, I get it. He wants what he thinks of his family together on this trip, but they aren't that for you. Tell him you'd love to spend some solo time with him which you haven't been able to do in *years* and if he's up for that, so are you but it's to be just the two of you and make that part clear. The ball is in his court then.", "NTA but Disney world is a big place! Eat and ride with them and run! You could take som photo too!", "NTA but I would recommend having a serious talk with your father in person just between the two of you. Let him know how you feel, how you were treated when you were younger, let him know how these \u201cfamily activities\u201d were a source a dread when you were young, and so is this all expenses paid trip.

Is there a chance you might enjoy it?", ">I really don't want to go.\n\nDon't go.  NTA.", "NTA, but I wouldn't consider sitting at the table with your family eating dinner as \"mandatory family time\".  That's not an uncommon thing in many families.  I don't think you are wrong though, for not wanting to participate as an adult though.\n\nWhat if you made your attendance contingent on spending time with your dad alone outside his house?", "NAH but maybe try and meet your step siblings as new adults you've just been introduced to for this trip instead of keeping them connected to trauma and baggage. My husband and I were in a similar situation and he found out they were pretty cool people as adults and also realized he wasn't the only person who was struggling during that time. \n\nWe still see them when they're in town independent of his step mom. Good luck and try to have fun with your partner at minimum without trying to unpack things you want to not worry about.", "Couple things. It\u2019s very clear that you harbor a lot of animosity towards your stepmom for the affair. Understandable. But that was your dad\u2019s misdeed and you\u2019ve clearly forgiven him. So maybe it\u2019s time to see whether you can move past this hatred as well. You also say that she treated you unfairly as a teenager but please understand that parents and teenagers have a tough time even in bio families. It really doesn\u2019t sound like she was doing anything particularly heinous to you. Matter of fact, she insisted on your participation and presence during family time when it would have been much easier for her to exclude you. Look if you don\u2019t like her you don\u2019t like her. Fine. But your dad chose her and has a long history and life with her and that\u2019s not changing. Is it possible for you to work thru your personal hate and overcome it so that you can have more family time while your dad is still around?", "NTA, period. You are entitled to your own feelings, and you need not make excuses for them.\n\nHowever, it might be time for a reset in your thinking. Stepmom has been around for nearly 20 years, so it seems like your dad has a woman he really loves in his life. Maybe it\u2019s time to give her a break. Also, siblings (even half and step) who don\u2019t get along all that well as children often have close, even loving relationships as adults. This might be a real chance to be honest with them all, tell them you have never given your best, and ask them to start over with you. Go on the trip, and try to build some bonds with them. The worst result would be that nothing much comes of the effort, but at least you would have tried. And the potential positives you may gain would be well worth the effort.", "NAH buuuuuut. You're an adult now. You can walk away from your stepmom if she's bothering you. You and your fiance can plan your own thing and meet up with them at dinner. There are ways to play this, and like you said, you want to spend time with your dad. I think you should go. There are worse things in life than a free trip to Disney.", "NTA but based on what you\u2019ve written you really should take a step back and examine how your attitude post divorce led to your struggles and your dislike of the entire step family being a self fulfilling prophecy. I say this as a divorced dad whose ex wife cheated. A lot of your post is about how dad didn\u2019t do this, or want that, etc etc and it was all stepmom.\n\nYou need to consider that your dad is the person who wanted this relationship more than the one with your mother. You say he\u2019s a pushover but it\u2019s been nearly 20 years and he\u2019s still with her. You\u2019ve entirely villainized your stepmom and victimized your father in trying to get through all of this when your dad is the only reason all of this exists in the first place.", "Stop \u201cweaseling\u201d out of these things and be honest. \u201cDad I miss you and want to spend time with you but I don\u2019t like stepmom and now that I\u2019m an adult I\u2019m really not interested in spending any time with her. I\u2019m not going to come to Disney because I can\u2019t think of a worse way to spend a vacation. I\u2019m sorry if that hurts to hear but I have no desire to spend my free time with stepmom. Instead of Disney can you and I just spend a few days together somewhere we would both enjoy? It doesn\u2019t need to be expensive but it does just need to be just us. I hope we can make this work because I\u2019d really love to see you.\u201d", "NTA. You should not go.\n\nThis part rung so true to me, and I sympathize so very much -- \"But I felt so free the day I wasn't forced to participate in my stepmom's activities anymore, and when the trip was announced instead of feeling happy I felt dread.\"\n\nYou need to honor that feeling to yourself. I felt the same way when I was a near-teenager, being pushed into Halloween events and yes, Disney World by my parents when I really didn't want to. I also got all kinds of friction for declining stuff like that, was told I was a bad kid for feeling that way, but likewise felt so much freedom when I got to make those decisions and get away from that stuff. Decades later, I still feel a rush when I get to make those independent decisions. (Weirdly we never did go to Disney World, my dad to this day will express regret, and still *not believe me* when I say I never wanted to go.)\n\nIn a comment you said that your dad takes trips north to do nature photography on his own.

Just try to do it in a way you get the blowback instead of dad.", "YTA. If you really love your dad and want to spend some time with him, then you\u2019d get over your dread and go. Is your dread more important or spending the limited time and not hurting your dad more important? Also, your step-siblings have partners and kids and chances are they\u2019re not the same as before and will spend most of their time tending to their kids anyways, as will your step-mother. So go on the trip and spend some time with your dad, maybe offer to hang out with dad so your step-mother can spend time with the grandkids.", "You really sound like the kid you were back in the days when your parents got divorced. It\u2019s okay to not go if you have any adult like reason, but in this case you only have offended teenager attitude and justification.

My parents divorced, and my dad had custody for me every 2 weeks on the weekends. Eventually dad remarried to the girl he cheated on my mom with, making her my stepmom.\n\nMy stepmom is narcissistic and manipulative. When she moved in with my dad (about a year after the divorce), suddenly my \"dad\" invented a lot of rules for teenage me to follow that weren't problems before. (\"Dad\" is in quotes because I suspect my stepmom is responsible.)\n\nAmong these was mandatory \"family time\", where I would be forced to hang out with my dad, stepmom, and my 3 step-siblings from my stepmom's prior marriage. Usually we'd eat dinner at the table together and watch a movie, but rarely we'd go out to the zoo or a theme park or whatever. Sometimes we'd stay at a hotel and make it a multi-day thing.\n\nI didn't get along with my stepmom nor my step-siblings and hated these trips, but I was forced to go on them because my dad had custody of me. My stepmom always got mad that I wasn't enjoying myself, and over the years I developed a reputation of lying about being sick, lying about work, doing whatever to get out of it.\n\nEventually they stopped doing \"family time\" altogether about a decade ago.

Both my step-sisters are married with small kids, while my stepbrother is in a long-term relationship (as am I).\n\nThis Christmas, we all got the same \"present\": my dad is paying for a trip to Walt Disney World for everyone. It was pitched as a revival of \"family time\" now that we never see each other. He's paying for everything - airfare, tickets, hotel, everything.

He and I haven't really hung out in years... but my stepmom follows him everywhere he goes and he isn't allowed to see me without her.\n\nI know he'd be very disappointed if I didn't go, and it would break my heart to hurt him like that when we don't know how long he has left.\n\nBut I felt so free the day I wasn't forced to participate in my stepmom's activities anymore, and when the trip was announced instead of feeling happy I felt dread, like I was a kid being forced to live under her roof again.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your dad having a heart attack certainly adds to the dilemma that you feel with your choice. My question would be if you did choose to go, are you going to be forced to do everything with the stepfamily, or can you go off and do things on your own time? It's not about the free trip or the spending money, it's about whether or not you feel your dad will be around long enough for you to get the chance to enjoy him. None of us are promised tomorrow and because you are an adult, you can stand on your own feet against your stepmom, if need be, however, the choice ultimately is only a choice you can make. The best advice I can give you is to sit down and think long and hard about how this is going to affect your personal well-being and make your choice after some serious thought.", "NTA - but I think you'll end up enjoying it if you do go.  Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.", "NAH But I think it's a question of what's the worst that happens if you go? You're an adult now so you can take your park ticket and wander off- you don't have to participate in scheduled time beyond what you specifically want to. \n\nHeck, you can call the hotel and request that your room be in a different floor or building than the rest of the clan. And if your dad was planning on renting a house, sorta tell him that you get why that makes sense but it wouldn't be fair to the kids that they have to be quiet in the morning so you can sleep, nor would it be fair to you and GF that you have to quiet in the evening to the kids can sleep. It makes more sense for you to be off.\n\nAnd at the same time suggest that Stepmom's kids would probably like to have a day or a meal just them and their mom, and wouldn't that be a nice thing for Dad to surprise Stepmom and her kids with. While they do that Dad can hang out with you and GF. (Cuz I imagine your stepsiblings can some similar feelings. It's possible that they get time with mom without your dad but I imagine they'd like it at places like Disney too.)\n\nBut it's also okay to opt out and tell Dad that you'd rather have some time just the two of you. You want to spend one-on-one time with him. And if he doesn't want that, it's his choice. But if you have to chose between spending your limited vacation seeing your dad but not getting time with him or taking a relaxing vacation another time, that you'd opt for the 2nd.", "NTA but I would go. I just wouldn\u2019t do anything I didn\u2019t want to do. For instance if they\u2019re spending all day in fantasyland I\u2019d be like cool I\u2019m going on the big rides see you at dinner. I\u2019d also talk to my dad and ask him if he could make a point to find a few hours or a meal time one day where it could be just the two of us. And I\u2019d plainly say if he can\u2019t I understand, but this will be the last time I spend \u201cfamily\u201d time with them, because he\u2019s your family and you don\u2019t get any time with him.

Maybe seek advice on a relationship subreddit on how to respond No to this. \n\nImo you should outright say no and list why. \n\nYou could also ask for advice on how to set firm boundaries and set consequences for breaking boundaries if you do decide to go...or for whenever you have to interact with step-mom and dad.", "Ask your dad to invite me I\u2019ll take your place I never been to Disney before \ud83d\ude0c", "It sucks, but I would go for it.

A person should never knowingly get involved with another person who is married.", "If you decide to take the trip, remember, Disney has four parks.

It's not like you're 10 years old and too young to go off by yourself.", "NTA. I think you need to decide whether it is worth spending time with your dad, who you feel you may not have tons of time left in exchange for dealing with your stepmother. It might be worth seeing if you could ask your dad for a dinner together one on one as a condition of you going. You are an adult now so if things are really bad, you can just leave. She can never have you back and control you, you get to decide your boundaries.\n\nNow that boundary may be never doing anything she ever organizes ever again. You get to decide that.

It sounds like your dad blew up your life by having an affair and understandably you resented the stepmom for it.

A day at Disney is exhausting and it isn't like you are going to a tropical resort where you really have to interact with the group you came with. \n\nYou do what you want - eat at Disney - people watch - make friends with the strangers waiting on line with you for hours and then come back late at night to your hotel - crash and wake up early to get a head start on the day.", "NTA, it's a free trip & you can ditch them any time.", "NTA.  I would not go if you don't want too.  It is your Dad's fault that you two don't spend any time alone together because he allows his wife dictate that, so that's on HIM.  As someone else suggested, ask if you can go with him the next time he goes to take his pictures if you want time alone with him.  I would suggest it maybe at the last minute (for him) so there is less chance for her to add herself to the trip.\n\nOP your Dad had enough 'backbone' to have an affair and cheat on your Mom so he should have had enough 'spine' to protect his relationship with his own child, but he didn't.  He ALLOWED her to dictate his whole life so stop blaming this all on the stepmother.  He ALLOWS THIS.\n\nThis goes under the same 'if he wanted to, he would'.  He doesn't.

I suppose since all the step siblings have families, they'll be busy themselves.\n\nAlso, keep your partner away from your step mom.

Maybe OP\u2018s partner can he convinced to distract stepmom for a few hours so he can spend some alone time with his dad.", "Either OP's father is a very weak man, or OP is in the habit of blaming every decision dad makes that he doesn't like on the stepmom. Some of what OP describes sound like reasonable interactions that are viewed as odd or unreasonable by teenagers. OP's family went through a fundamental change, with a new home and new people (it doesn't matter why this happened, it did and everyone needs to live with that. I know that's an unpopular opinion on reddit). With changes like that, it's actually pretty reasonable that some expectations would change too, that there would be new rules and OP would be expected to have dinner and hang out with the family. This is a normal family thing. I also think it's normal for a teenager to be moody on multi-day family trips, and stepmom probably made it worse by not just accepting that and trying to push for some picture perfect outcome. \n\nIn any case, OP is an adult now and can do whatever he wants.", "Fully agree", "Yeah, my partner knows.\n\nIt's funny - I had largely avoided talking about my history with my stepmom before they met. On the drive home after their first meeting, she was like \"Is it just me, or is she kind of manipulative?\" and then I was glad I wasn't just biased.\n\nMy dad also knows that my stepmom and I don't get along. It's, uh, hard not to notice. My stepmom and I used to get into really heated (verbal) fights. In recent years she's tried to make nice but I still dislike her for a whole host of reasons and I think I always will.", "I actually worked at Disneyland for 5 years as a Jungle Cruise skipper - my crazy Disney schedule was how I finally managed to permanently get out of \"family time\" to begin with!\n\nI originally had that detail in another draft of this post (they want to go around Thanksgiving, which you and I both know is a terrible idea) but I had to trim it for length.", "My SO has the same name as my mom (what would Freud say?) so this would be actually hilarious.\n\n\"What? You said I could bring Michelle! Oh, _that_ Michelle???\"", "I love this malicious compliance", "Not yet, but I did give him a look when he asked if I would be able to get the time off. I was noncommittal and just said I was going to try.", "THIS is the right response to me - I agree except my judgment is NTA as the whole reason OP doesn't want to go is due to a long-standing history of their stepmom being an asshole and their dad seemingly refusing to do anything about it and going along with stepmom's rule of him not being able to see OP without her along. \n\nSo there are definitely some assholes here, but I totally co-sign the rest of this. I think it might be worth OP going for the reasons cited above, as long as it can be confirmed that OP + partner have their own room.", "This is by far the most emotionally even-handed response here.", "The problem is, dad will agree and then it won't happen b/c dad won't go against step mom and OP is trapped on vacation w/ them, miserable, dissapointed and guilt ridden.\n\nOP should just be honest, not go and tell dad he would.like to spend some 1:1 time before the trip or when he gets back. If dad weasels out b/c step-mom won't let him, at least OP isn't left holding the bag.", "Correction: she is a side piece with a promotion.", "She is accepting of my answer and isn't going to force the issue, but I asked her for her opinion and she gave it. That's all it is, nothing serious.", "I mean maybe? I doubt it, though. It's a relatively short trip by WDW standards (4 days, 1 park per day, then a day to fly in and a day to fly out).\n\nI'm not sure I'd be able to separate him from everyone else necessarily, and we wouldn't be able to take an extra day to do something together. Maybe we can do something at the parks but it'd be for a couple hours at best.", "Yeah, I mean...forced family time...where we eat together and watch a movie...this aint exactly the cinderella story.  OP is hung up and defensive of their mother, to their own detriment.", "Tbh I wouldn\u2019t personally consider the woman my father cheated on my mom with to be considered \u201cfamily\u201d, I don\u2019t blame OP for not wanting 2 be around her and her kids.", "Yep, another part of my reasoning which I had to trim for length is simply that I don't want to support Florida with sales tax revenue right now.", "How about asking your dad to do wildlife weekend photography together? Sounds like you would be able to get that alone time. And you don\u2019t really have to go into the field. Just hang out when he\u2019s done at night. As for Disney - I would take advantage personally. It\u2019s a huge place and SM can\u2019t make you do a damn thing you don\u2019t want.", "> There were a couple times as a kid where my stepmom demanded I be punished for something or another and my dad would make a big show of taking away my laptop (etc.) only to show up in my room at 2 AM and quietly give it back to me.\n\nAwww. I'm equal parts touched and outraged here. It's like something out of a sitcom.\n\nWhatever his shortcomings, it sounds like you love your dad very much...and he's not about to change now.\n\nIf it's the only way you can spend time with him, I would go on the trip and do my best to have a good time with him.\n\nPerhaps your fiancee can run interference with the stepmom so she doesn't intrude quite as much as usual.\n\n**EDIT:** I just noticed this part **\"My dad (like myself) gets pushed around a lot.\"** I know it's easier said than done but try to stand up for yourself while you're still young enough to change. Learn from your father's mistakes.", "Here is your chance for one on your one time with your dad. Meet him on his photography trip.  Unless stepmom reads his communications with you, which is a distinct possibility, she will be unaware of your rendezvous.", "Go with your dad on one of his photo trips and tell him you won't be going to disney.", "Could you meet him sometime for the wildlife photo trips?  Just the two of you?", "I'm sorry, man. That sucks. But I agree that you should go on the trip and do your best to enjoy it.", "The key to all this is in your final paragraph here - offer to take him on a trip to somewhere he\u2019d really like to go. Somewhere he\u2019s always wanted to go photograph but never got round to it. Just the two of you.", "The next time your dad is planning one of these trips, why not speak to him when you know step mom is not around and ask whether you can join him? It can be a \"secret\" from step mom. It sounds like it would be of benefit for both of you if you could come clean about your feelings over these almost 20 years. A time for mending, so to speak.", "It sounds like you really don't want to go on this trip, and I can see why. Sure, it's a free trip, but it's not a grownup vacation. It's a trip for your stepmom's kids and grandkids. And you could go and do your own thing with your fiance, but $200 won't get you far at Disney, so you'd have to eat all of your meals with the \"family\" if you don't want to pay yourself.\n\nI'm glad to hear your dad recovered from his heart attack, but instead of forcing yourself to be with people that make you miserable, maybe it's time for a real conversation with your dad about your relationship. He cheated on your mom and made that woman your stepmom. Your stepmom made you miserable and your dad let her. As an adult, you try to make plans specifically with him, but he brings your stepmom anyway. He sounds like a shitty dad. But you are repeating his mistakes by not communicating boundaries and holding strong. You are both grownups and if he wants a relationship with you, he needs to respect your boundaries. If he doesn't want a relationship with you, it's better that you find out now and work through it in therapy.\n\nLast,\n\n>My dad (like myself) gets pushed around a lot and just takes it. He's a quiet, go-with-the-flow kinda guy and sometimes that makes him a bit of a wet napkin.\n\nYou don't want to go on this trip. If your fiance is still confused and pressures you to go anyway. . . i hope you see that for the red flag that it is.", "She definitely sounds abusive", "I think it's the former. Largely because of what OP said about the stepmom insisting on punishing him/taking his laptop away, and the dad acquiescing only to return the laptop in the middle of the night.\n\nThe stepmom just comes across as overly controlling. Normally step parents stand back and allow the biological parent to take the reigns when it comes to disciplining the child. Especially step parents who come into the child's life once they're older. At the very least the bio parents gets final say. But it sounds very much like OP's dad was indeed the type to always go along to get along in this marriage.", "This was my take as well. I think OP is a little mentally stuck in that teenage mindset because it was probably traumatic to have your nuclear family blown up due to an affair", "There really is no point in going. You won't get any time w/ your dad anyway and it will just be miserable for you. \n\nYou should have been your Dad's 1st priority. If he doesn't get quality time with you now, that is not something YOU should feel guilty about.", "Or you can go, you don't have to spend all your time with them. Enjoy they time you can spend with him while tolerating your step family. Then you and partner do stuff without them.", "I worked at DLR too after WDW, i saw picture from holiday week this year, made me realize I am happy I am not there! Idk if you\u2019ve been to WDW, but that ain\u2019t no vacation, fun but not relaxing!", "Omg. I\u2019m a scientist in my 40s but I would give anything to be a jungle cruise skipper!!\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02", "\"family time\"", "That's hilarious.", "Not with the trip. With everything from day one with your step family", "I\u2019m sorry this has all happened to you. You must have been worried when he had the heart attack.  I also hope your mother\u2019s side has been better for you.  Whether or not you go, you can let your father know he is loved with cards, letters, memories, words.  Cheers, mate.\n\nPS.  Disney World - wandering around a mobbed kiddyland *shudder*.   :-)", "If she has been married to his father for 15+ years, this person has been around long enough that she is now a package deal with the father.", "Exactly. Everyone is an adult now. You can decide how much family time you can tolerate on the trip and how much time you want to spend with your dad alone.", "I\u2019d suggest the same.\n\nGo on the trip with fianc\u00e9 acting as a buffer.\n\nIf you can get a moment alone with your dad (fianc\u00e9 has SM distracted) offer to join him on a trip up north, and maybe not tell SM you\u2019ll be there.", "I think this is kind of a new concept in parenting. When I was a kid, step and bioparents parented together as a unit on day to day things while the child was at that home, bioparents parented together on big things concerning the kid's life. So for example, my godfather's stepson lived with him and my godmother (his mom) almost 24/7, as his biodad lived in another country. SD was the 24/7 parent, so he and the mom made rules together about their home and enforced them together. His mom and biodad coordinated on decisions like education and finances, custody agreements, etc. This was not uncommon among my friends with divorced/remarried parents. \n\nSo again, either stepmom unilaterally made decisions without talking it through with dad (possible), or dad just can't stand to make anyone angry and went back on his own decisions (also possible). OP doesn't tell us why he would be punished, it's possible he was punished over totally legit things. My friend in the previous example would be punished by his stepdad for the exact same things and in the same ways as I was by my parents, but I couldn't blame it on him not being my \"real\" dad, and he could (and did). But that didn't make the punishment any less warranted, because consequences are about behavior, not who is doling it out. I think we've kind of stepped from this as a society, that only certain people in a kid's life have the \"right\" to enforce consequences for bad behavior. I personally disagree with this, and I have my reasons for that, but whatever. In any case, OP's dad is an adult, and ultimately he needed to either work with his wife to agree on what are appropriate punishments for particular behaviors and stick to that, or tell his wife her demands are inappropriate. Sneaking back into the kid's room to secretly undermine the other parents, and kind of themselves, is not only silly but also manipulative. Imagine a situation where an older kid is bullying a younger kid (I'm not saying OP did this, but just imagine a generic example), Parent 1 says \"your punishment is no laptop,\" and Parent 2 agrees. If Parents 2 then sneaks back at 2 am to return the laptop, what is message the kid is getting? 1. Parent 1 was wrong and unreasonable to punish that behavior 2. Parent 2 can't tell Parent 1, because of how unreasonable they are (or something) 3. It's ok to continue unacceptable behavior because Parent 2 will bail you out. \n\nEverything OP describes, down to the affair, takes two people, but OP seems to place most of the blame on the stepmom, perhaps because he identifies with his dad's personality more. Allowing someone else to just indiscriminately take the reigns for your family and just following along is also a choice. The only thing I will say truly strikes me as overly controlling is that the stepmom will tag along on everything with her husband.", "No, not when they both have kids. She couldn't have her husband treating his kid one way and hers another", "Totally. I think a lot of people get hung up on the process of divorce (regardless of how it was spurred on) and just never accept their new reality. Whether the stepparent was the affair partner, or someone the parent met years down the line, they represent either the reason the bio parents aren't together, or will not get back together, and out of spite kids will just refuse to accept it. It worse when there is a parent on the other end encouraging it, and I see plenty of that too. Please, all parents of children going through a breakup: put your personal issues aside and get on the same page about how you're going to coparent, and how and when you're going to include new partners in the coparenting process.", "Oh, yeah, I saw that picture too. Very happy I don't work there anymore...", "It's fun as a thing you can do for a couple hours.\n\nWhen it's 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, sometimes 10 days in a row (you don't get to control when your weekends are, not really)... it gets tiring.\n\nIt was a fun thing to do for a couple years. It stopped being fun by year 3, and those last 2 years were me running on fumes.\n\nIf it were like a purely optional thing where I could do it when I wanted and stop when I wanted, it would be amazing. But once you work for the Mouse you have to give him complete control over your life.", "Ah, yeah, he knows. I've told him a few times over the years, and it's very obvious my stepmom and I don't get along.", "My mother's side is much better. My mother herself can be a terror sometimes but her heart is genuinely in the right place and she and I get along fine. And my stepdad is fantastic and wonderful and I love him to death.", "Love this!", "Of course she could. People have different parenting styles all the time.\n\nIt's not her role/right to dictate how he raises his son.", "I would get him alone. Tell him no and explain why in detail.", "Outstanding!  May you take the lessons of your stepdad into your adulthood and make them your own."]}
