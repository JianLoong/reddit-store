However, there are possible reasons that it\u2019s not realistic to have happen. Your dad may not have the spare money to pay for lawyer fees to charge custody. Or the spare energy to fight for it. Especially if your mom was as petty towards him during the divorce as she seems to be towards your stepmom. There\u2019s a lot of shit she can pull. It\u2019s worth asking your dad, since judges put a lot more weight on a 16 year old\u2019s ask to live with one parent full time.

Your feelings are telling you exactly who your real Mom is and it's so beautiful that Stacy stepped up to the plate and cared for you in the way a mother should, in a way that you deserve.

It makes sense for you to want to spend time in a house where you feel supported and are treated fairly. \n\nAnd I get your fathers point too\u2014he probably doesn\u2019t want to encourage you to spend less time with your bio mom bc then it would feel like he was damaging your relationship with her(even though it\u2019s your bio mom who is damaging it by treating you the way she does)\n\n\nIF you decide you really do want to spend less time with your bio mom, ask your dad and step mom for a private sit down conversation. Tell them how you feel, and why. That the home and family that you\u2019re apart of with them is the one where emotionally you thrive at. Ask if they think there\u2019s a way for you to spend less time over with your bio mom. \n\nIt\u2019ll really depend on what type of coparenting relationship your mom and dad have, and how your mom feels about it as far as if it can be adjusted easily without involving the court. \n\nLike for example I stopped doing custody with my dad when I was 16. There was nothing officially done\u2014I just stopped and he was okay with it. \n\nYou could also try to think of ways to be more out of the house when it\u2019s time for you to be at your moms. Like maybe there are scholarships you might want to apply to in the future that require volunteer hours? And you can spend some of that time volunteering for a good cause and getting out of the house. \n\nAnd then of course there\u2019s the legal option. At your age, most states (assuming you\u2019re in the US) allow a minor your age to have input on which parent they live with. Your dad and step mom would have to be on board with this. And if they aren\u2019t on board with taking it to court, try to hear them out on their reasoning\u2014DON\u2019T just assume they don\u2019t want you there full time. It seems clear they love you and want you there. \n\nIf you find that you cant stop feeling guilty, or are having a hard time  handling things, or just that you need someone else to talk to\u2014dont be afraid to ask your dad and step mom if therapy is an option.", "NTA.  Stacey has earned your love and you get to choose who gets to be called mom.  Your dad seems to be taking a more neutral stance.  He is right though; in a few short years you can choose your interaction completely without having a court order to back it.  If you can't ride out the next two years, then try talking to your dad again about getting full custody and seeing if a judge would let you choose not to go to your mom's house again.", "NTA, just hang in there for 2 more years. It will fly by. My petty self wants you to tell your mom that in 2 years you will be out of her life for good and will no contact with her.....LOL. But hang in there though!", "NTA break it down for your dad. When you go over there it is your birth mom rejecting you over and over and it is taking a toll on your mental health. If he still persists, maybe speak with a counselor at school to Isee if they may be able to speak to your father.", "Oh honey. It's not horrible. It's okay to wish that the person who behaved as your mom was actually your mom. You're so NTA for that. \n\nJust remember that the relationships you have with people are more important than the labels they carry. Stacey can be your stepmom and to you, that can be a treasured word. It can mean what you want it to mean. It can mean even more than \"mom\" does if you want it to. The love you have for each other and the regard you hold for each other is way more important than the label.", "Stacey sounds wonderful.  Happy OP has her.  Maybe it's time for dad to ask for full custody.", "Exactly, surely at sixteen, the OP's views should completely be taken into consideration. She's half grown and shouldn't be forced into maintaining a relationship if she doesn't want to.

Check around for children advocates or free legal clinics.", ">while you're a minor you mom has legal parental rights, which includes visitation.\n\nShe's old enough custody courts might  take her wants into consideration...maybe.

You're allowed to say \"hey, Person-B has been more supportive and attended my milestone moments more than Person-A and this feels a bit backwards\". From that, you're NTA in that you want to be in a custody arrangement that gives you more B time. \n\nThe fact that your bio-mom squanders the little bit of time she already gets with you changes this from an n-a-h judgement to her being an asshole. If she didn't want to feel replaced, maybe she shouldn't have replaced *you*. \n\nFortunately your dad is right and, as soon as you turn 18, you can choose where you stay and, if Stacey is your \"Mom\" mom, bio-mom and just stay \"Bio-mom\".

Some cite Proverbs 18:24 as the origin of the \"covenant\" quote, but Proverbs 18:24 has no mention of either blood or water.  Richard Pustelniak and  Jack Albert (in 1994 and 2005, respectively) both claim that Henry Trumbull translated an Arabic proverb to mean \"The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb,\" but in fact, upon further examination  Trumull's 1885 translation never mentions water (his translation refers to mother's milk). It is unclear where Pustelniak and Albert found their sources, as they don't cite them.  The English language phrase \"blood is thicker than water\" first appears in Irish and Scottish texts in the 1700's. \"The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb\" did not appear in English until 1994, and is not an accurate translation of any known proverb. Seems to be a classic case of confusion, misattribution, and imagined history becuase, ya know, it sounds like it could be true. So turns out the idiom means 100% what everyone thinks it does.", "I've heard it originally meant familial blood was stronger than everything else, but people started saying \"blood of the covenant is stronger than water of the womb.\"\n\nSo it really means both! But I prefer the latter", "NTA....at this point I think you could just refuse to go with her.  What would she do?  Go to court to force it?  That's a win for you because you can tell the judge what you want and your reasons.  My guess is she wouldn't do anything because of money.  So I'd just refuse to go.  You're old enough now to make that decision.", "NTA, OP!\n\nThere is NOTHING \"horrible\" about wanting a mother who actually treats you like her daughter instead of as a \"third wheel\" who's only useful for free babysitting!

Your mother shouldn't even be pressing you to do such things and placing that burden on your shoulders. You were not born to fulfill her wants, and let's just be clear they are all once, not needs.\n\nTalk to your father about what you want so that you can advocate for yourself in the custody issue. You should go to whatever house it is that you want to live in and that you are going to be treated the best in for the remainder of your childhood.

Now look while *feeling* them as individuals linked to you. Major difference? Does one face look kinder/more welcoming/more familiar than the other? \n\nIf you can see each woman as they are as individual people separate to you, then you reduce the socially prescribed associations which expect you to feel a certain way about either. Step mom's can be good, and birth mothers can be crap. It is what it is. Do you have classmates/teacher/boss that you wouldn't actually choose to be friends with, but you accept their presence quite happily within a specific context? You can apply this to your birth mother. \n\nWhen we truly see and accept someone as they are, we limit our expectations of them. When our expectations match the other person's capacity then we are less disappointed because the bar is not set too high or too low.\n\nYou birth mother is choosing to miss out on you.
