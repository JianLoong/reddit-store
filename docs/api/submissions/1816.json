There is nothing to be confused about, I think your feelings are natural and normal.", "NTA - You are also at the age where the court would consider what you want when discussing the custody agreement. So ask your dad to bring it up =)", "NTA. Stacey is your mom. Do you have to keep going to your bio mom's house? At 16 , you should have a choice. If you do have to keep going, just do your best to stay calm and one the clock strikes midnight on your 18th birthday, you can never go again if you don't want to.", "Blood relations do not a mother make. NTA", "NTA. Honestly, I consider \u201cmom\u201d to be a thing you do, not a title you automatically get. Your stepmom is acting like a mom. Your bio mom is not. You\u2019re not horrible at all for seeing that. \n\nIt\u2019s completely reasonable to want to avoid her and spend time with people who are being good parents. However, there are possible reasons that it\u2019s not realistic to have happen. Your dad may not have the spare money to pay for lawyer fees to charge custody. Or the spare energy to fight for it. Especially if your mom was as petty towards him during the divorce as she seems to be towards your stepmom. There\u2019s a lot of shit she can pull. It\u2019s worth asking your dad, since judges put a lot more weight on a 16 year old\u2019s ask to live with one parent full time. But know that it may not be feasible. \n\nI know two years seems like forever right now, but if you can\u2019t get it changed, you can make it. Then just go to \u201cChristmas card and occasional text\u201d relationship for biomom and reserve your energy for those who are giving you theirs.", "NTA.  Keep your relationships positive with your dad and Stacey, and just hang on.  You'll be 18 soon and your days as a free babysitter will be over -", "NTA. Hang in there.

You're not obliged to try to salvage that relationship, but it's worth considering.", "Nta.", "NTA and, in the US with most states, you are old enough to go to court and request a change of agreements. You can request your visitation to your mother be an \"at-will\" for when YOU want.\n\nIt's a shame Bio Mom can't see you for who you are. I wish you luck.", "Nta, but your dad is right, while you're a minor you mom has legal parental rights, which includes visitation.  Once you're an adult you get full decision making though.", "NTA and surely they can take into consideration your age here.", "Oof, I'm sorry you're dealing with this. It sounds like your Mom is still not over you dad and she's unconsciously taking it out on you. You would think now that they're both remarried, she wouldn't have a problem with Stacy just like your Dad (I'm assuming) doesn't have a problem with your stepdad being involved in your life. It seems like your bio Mom is incredibly insecure and unfortunately her insecurities are hurting and affecting you. Even though she's not aware of what she's doing, you'll be able to set more stringent boundaries when you're 18. Please don't judge yourself or think you're horrible for wishing Stacy was your bio Mom. You are entitled to feel the way you do, and your feelings aren't wrong. Your feelings are telling you exactly who your real Mom is and it's so beautiful that Stacy stepped up to the plate and cared for you in the way a mother should, in a way that you deserve. Also, if you know your only going to be used as a free babysitter, maybe you can make up some excuse as to why you can't go to her on the weekends or the summer? NTA. You're entitled to your feelings because they are telling you the truth about your situation. Keep listening to them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

However your dad might not be able to revise the custody agreement or it might be more trouble in the long run.  Keep the relationship with Stacey and your Dad transparent and again when your an adult you\u2019ll be able to make your choices.\n\nStacey as a mom is the one who has got it going on.", "NTA. It makes sense for you to want to spend time in a house where you feel supported and are treated fairly. \n\nAnd I get your fathers point too\u2014he probably doesn\u2019t want to encourage you to spend less time with your bio mom bc then it would feel like he was damaging your relationship with her(even though it\u2019s your bio mom who is damaging it by treating you the way she does)\n\n\nIF you decide you really do want to spend less time with your bio mom, ask your dad and step mom for a private sit down conversation. Tell them how you feel, and why. That the home and family that you\u2019re apart of with them is the one where emotionally you thrive at. Ask if they think there\u2019s a way for you to spend less time over with your bio mom. \n\nIt\u2019ll really depend on what type of coparenting relationship your mom and dad have, and how your mom feels about it as far as if it can be adjusted easily without involving the court. \n\nLike for example I stopped doing custody with my dad when I was 16. There was nothing officially done\u2014I just stopped and he was okay with it. \n\nYou could also try to think of ways to be more out of the house when it\u2019s time for you to be at your moms. Like maybe there are scholarships you might want to apply to in the future that require volunteer hours? And you can spend some of that time volunteering for a good cause and getting out of the house. \n\nAnd then of course there\u2019s the legal option. At your age, most states (assuming you\u2019re in the US) allow a minor your age to have input on which parent they live with. Your dad and step mom would have to be on board with this. And if they aren\u2019t on board with taking it to court, try to hear them out on their reasoning\u2014DON\u2019T just assume they don\u2019t want you there full time. It seems clear they love you and want you there. \n\nIf you find that you cant stop feeling guilty, or are having a hard time  handling things, or just that you need someone else to talk to\u2014dont be afraid to ask your dad and step mom if therapy is an option.", "NTA.  Stacey has earned your love and you get to choose who gets to be called mom.  Your dad seems to be taking a more neutral stance.  He is right though; in a few short years you can choose your interaction completely without having a court order to back it.  If you can't ride out the next two years, then try talking to your dad again about getting full custody and seeing if a judge would let you choose not to go to your mom's house again.", "NTA, just hang in there for 2 more years. It will fly by. My petty self wants you to tell your mom that in 2 years you will be out of her life for good and will no contact with her.....LOL. But hang in there though!", "NTA break it down for your dad. When you go over there it is your birth mom rejecting you over and over and it is taking a toll on your mental health. If he still persists, maybe speak with a counselor at school to Isee if they may be able to speak to your father.", "Oh honey. It's not horrible. It's okay to wish that the person who behaved as your mom was actually your mom. You're so NTA for that. \n\nJust remember that the relationships you have with people are more important than the labels they carry. Stacey can be your stepmom and to you, that can be a treasured word. It can mean what you want it to mean. It can mean even more than \"mom\" does if you want it to. The love you have for each other and the regard you hold for each other is way more important than the label.", "Stacey sounds wonderful.  Happy OP has her.  Maybe it's time for dad to ask for full custody.", "Exactly, surely at sixteen, the OP's views should completely be taken into consideration. She's half grown and shouldn't be forced into maintaining a relationship if she doesn't want to. Absolutely ridiculous that courts in America (and that's where I am 95% certain this is based) treat teenagers like infants.", "This. OP can petition a court herself I think. Check around for children advocates or free legal clinics.", ">while you're a minor you mom has legal parental rights, which includes visitation.\n\nShe's old enough custody courts might  take her wants into consideration...maybe. If anything, the judge will have it on record and that can make a difference.", "So, first off, you're not an asshole for having feelings related to how people treat you. You're allowed to say \"hey, Person-B has been more supportive and attended my milestone moments more than Person-A and this feels a bit backwards\". From that, you're NTA in that you want to be in a custody arrangement that gives you more B time. \n\nThe fact that your bio-mom squanders the little bit of time she already gets with you changes this from an n-a-h judgement to her being an asshole. If she didn't want to feel replaced, maybe she shouldn't have replaced *you*. \n\nFortunately your dad is right and, as soon as you turn 18, you can choose where you stay and, if Stacey is your \"Mom\" mom, bio-mom and just stay \"Bio-mom\". Doesn't sound like there's anyone worth considering telling you otherwise.", "NTA. Mom and mother are synonyms that sometimes don\u2019t mean the same thing.", "NTA. I'm just curious though why your dad expects you to continue subjecting yourself to the toxic relationship with your mother. The whole \"you have to love me because I'm blood\" thing just drives me absolutely bonkers.", "NTA. I understand it\u2019s confusing because your mother has MADE it confusing for you. As you pointed out, she\u2019s a hypocrite who has emotionally neglected you but is then possessive of you. \n\nBut I want you to know that it\u2019s okay and totally normal to wish that the person who loves and supports you were your bio mom, because that\u2019s the only motherly care you\u2019re getting. Your bio moms behavior is narcissistic and it\u2019s likely she\u2019ll never take responsibility for the way she has treated you. Don\u2019t worry about hurting her feeling or upsetting her, you need to do what\u2019s right for you and your well-being.", "NTA.
