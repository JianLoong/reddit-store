He is great about holding & sleeping through the night as long as it is a calm environment. My bf stays over every weekend. He knows my schedule and how I have been operating.\n\nLast Saturday my boyfriend(37m) wanted to go downtown to hangout with his friends on a rooftop bar. I decided to stay home. He asked if he should come back to sleep over or not and I said he could as long as he doesn't come home super late. He said he wouldn't be long, would be back by 8pm. He left at around noon and left his backpack here since he would be returning. I didn't hear from him all day, until about 7pm when bf said he was leaving soon. Then for the next three hours my boyfriend kept saying he would be leaving soon or \"getting ready to leave\". He would lie and say he was walking to the train but then 45 minutes later when he still wasn't here I messaged to see where he was he said they were still hanging out. This behavior was triggering for reasons I won't get into based on past incidents and I felt like he was dicking me around.\n\nAt 10pm I was really aggravated and felt like an ass waiting around. Also I did not want my puppy to wake up and get excited / confused + potentially have an accident when my bf strolled in at god knows what time and then I would have to take him out. We are in a night routine that has been working for us and I don't want to mess with it. So when my bf said yet again \"getting on train soon\", I texted back and said don't come back here, go home, I am going to sleep. My boyfriend did not reply.\n\nThe next day he came to get his bag and left without barely saying a word. Afterwards he texted me saying I left him stranded and just ripped me to shreds. Since then I haven't heard from him, it's been a week and I am getting the silent treatment.\n\nAfter thinking about it I realized he must have left his house keys in his backpack. How was I to know? I wish he had just told me that instead of immediately turning silent on Saturday night when I told him not to come back here. I would have left his bag outside my door if he needed his keys. So the lack of communication and immediately turning sullen I don't get.\n\nAITA? I kind of feel like a witch based on my bf's treatment on me right now so maybe I was being unnecessarily harsh and unreasonable.", "created_utc": 1682190606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12vfyab/aita_for_not_letting_my_boyfriend_back_into_my/", "score": 1138, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because it sounds like you\u2019re saying that if someone who cares about you makes the choice to treat you like shit, it must somehow be your fault. And that is the kind of belief that makes you a perfect target for gaslighting, manipulation and emotional abuse. A good therapist will help you develop the skills to change that. \n\nBased on your reaction, I\u2019m guessing this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s disrespected you, then acted sullen and upset if/when you set an *extremely* reasonable boundary, leading you to think you must be at fault, because why would he be mean to you if you\u2019ve done nothing wrong?\n\nThe answer is he treats you that way because it works. Because he knows he can easily manipulate you into blaming yourself for expecting him to act like a reasonable adult. There is no reality in which this situation wasn\u2019t 100% his fault, and I frankly wouldn\u2019t have put up with it half as long as you did. He had many opportunities to mention his keys if they were in his backpack, and he had the option to bring them with him instead of leaving them at your place like an idiot. At no point was it even a little bit your responsibility to ensure he had his keys.
