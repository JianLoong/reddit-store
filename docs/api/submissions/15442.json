He is great about holding & sleeping through the night as long as it is a calm environment. My bf stays over every weekend. He knows my schedule and how I have been operating.\n\nLast Saturday my boyfriend(37m) wanted to go downtown to hangout with his friends on a rooftop bar. I decided to stay home. He asked if he should come back to sleep over or not and I said he could as long as he doesn't come home super late. He said he wouldn't be long, would be back by 8pm. He left at around noon and left his backpack here since he would be returning. I didn't hear from him all day, until about 7pm when bf said he was leaving soon. Then for the next three hours my boyfriend kept saying he would be leaving soon or \"getting ready to leave\". He would lie and say he was walking to the train but then 45 minutes later when he still wasn't here I messaged to see where he was he said they were still hanging out. This behavior was triggering for reasons I won't get into based on past incidents and I felt like he was dicking me around.\n\nAt 10pm I was really aggravated and felt like an ass waiting around. Also I did not want my puppy to wake up and get excited / confused + potentially have an accident when my bf strolled in at god knows what time and then I would have to take him out. We are in a night routine that has been working for us and I don't want to mess with it. So when my bf said yet again \"getting on train soon\", I texted back and said don't come back here, go home, I am going to sleep. My boyfriend did not reply.\n\nThe next day he came to get his bag and left without barely saying a word. Afterwards he texted me saying I left him stranded and just ripped me to shreds. Since then I haven't heard from him, it's been a week and I am getting the silent treatment.\n\nAfter thinking about it I realized he must have left his house keys in his backpack. How was I to know? I wish he had just told me that instead of immediately turning silent on Saturday night when I told him not to come back here. I would have left his bag outside my door if he needed his keys. So the lack of communication and immediately turning sullen I don't get.\n\nAITA?

And that is the kind of belief that makes you a perfect target for gaslighting, manipulation and emotional abuse. A good therapist will help you develop the skills to change that. \n\nBased on your reaction, I\u2019m guessing this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s disrespected you, then acted sullen and upset if/when you set an *extremely* reasonable boundary, leading you to think you must be at fault, because why would he be mean to you if you\u2019ve done nothing wrong?\n\nThe answer is he treats you that way because it works. Because he knows he can easily manipulate you into blaming yourself for expecting him to act like a reasonable adult. There is no reality in which this situation wasn\u2019t 100% his fault, and I frankly wouldn\u2019t have put up with it half as long as you did. He had many opportunities to mention his keys if they were in his backpack, and he had the option to bring them with him instead of leaving them at your place like an idiot. At no point was it even a little bit your responsibility to ensure he had his keys. His choices and his choices alone are what lead to him having a less than stellar end to his night. \n\nIf you\u2019re gonna stay with this gem of a guy, at least learn to start seeing through his bullshit and refusing to take the blame for *his* poor choices. \n\nNTA, obviously.", "This is about the most solid, easy NTA to be dished out in my brief time here.\n\nIf you're intending on staying in a place besides your own for the night, keeping the people there informed is just common courtesy. \"Hey, we're going to be later than expected. I'm going to sleep on XYZ's couch,\" or something like that is simply not a difficult text to send. Doubly so if you're in a serious relationship with that person. It wouldn't have taken more than five minutes for your boyfriend to step out a side door, give you a call to keep you informed, find out that coming over late was not a good idea, and make plans accordingly. Moreover, if he had done that, you two would probably be fine and this post wouldn't exist.\n\nSome of this is definitely coming from my own relationship history, but there's no way I would take that from a partner. The excuses for the silent treatment are exceedingly limited, and not only is \"I'm trying to make you feel guilty for my own asinine behaviour\" not on that list, it's grounds for a breakup.\n\nYour boyfriend is a dick. I'd let him go find a partner that enjoys playing mind games just as much as he does. You did absolutely nothing wrong.", "NTA and he is an awful boyfriend and you are being treated like a doormat.", "NTA I do get cheating vibes from his \u201cI\u2019m almost home nvm I haven\u2019t left \u201c story. Even without the puppy what he did was really rude to you, it seems like he is just lying to you. Red flag city. He\u2019s probably just giving you silent treatment to punish you for calling him on his shit. Let his silent treatment just be a break up", "I wish this guy wasn\u2019t your boyfriend any longer. Stick with the puppy, it will be a much more fulfilling relationship, and then the right man will come eventually. And NTA, if it wasn\u2019t obvious.", "NTA. Your apartment, your rules. He is inconsiderate at best. If I were you I\u2019d not contact him for a few days. If he doesn\u2019t try to get in touch with you then you have your answer.", "Both AH", "Nta. If he said he'd be home by 8 and expected you to wait around still at 11, he's not worth your time, and definitely doesn't value your time. Especially if he turns around and is mad at you?? Tf? Not worth the energy", "You were being inflexible for no reason and that really upset him. He felt like you took the schedule you have with your puppy more seriously than him being able to have some place to sleep in a city in which he does not live for the night.\n\nIn the midwest, sometimes people have a lot of time on their hands and you end up sitting around and talking for longer than you planned on. Just a couple days ago, I missed a bus because I was having a cigar with a friend of mine. I caught an Uber instead and got home a little later and my wife was a little annoyed, but we had dinner and it was fine. I wasn't ditching her. I was finishing my cigar and our good conversation. Just because a grown adult sets forth a timetable and does not stick to that time table does not mean that he is cheating.\n\nYTA", "NTA - Everything he did was disrespectful and wrong. His response the next day was immature and idiotic. In essence, he\u2019s pissed off at you for not waiting up all night for him while he lied about his whereabouts and intentions.\n\nPS. I don\u2019t think you have a boyfriend anymore. Take W. You dodged a bullet.", "What does playing you mean", "My husband did this to me one time, very early on in our relationship. I told him how hurtful it was; he apologized and never did it again. \n\nLiterally any other response is a red flag and a sign that it is purposeful disrespect.", "If he wanted to stay out, ask her to throw your shit in an Uber or go home and get it between bars. Dude needs to grow up. Nothing wrong with wanting to do your thing, but be direct.", "Getting caught up with friends is one thing. Saying you are on the way to the train when you are still at the bar is called LYING!", "Ya, I can see getting roped back into shit at the bar or wherever, but its easy\u2026communicate. Never give an end time when friends and alcohol are involved.", "So if I soberly promise not to cheat, but cheat when I\u2019m drunk I should be forgiven?", "Manipulated and/or taken advantage of.\n\nhttps://croussel98.medium.com/are-you-being-played-12651387f43e", "He was \"leaving\" for at least 3 hours when he didn't make any attempt to do so. That's a significant amount of time. And he hadn't even left by the time OP gave up. You say you're going to be home in an hour, and don't show up for 4 hours, that's blowing someone off.", "Embarrassing behavior from a twenty year old, nevermind a grown ass man. Sis, dump him, you can do better.", "NTA, but please dump this loser who has nothing better to do than go party at a bar, lie to you about when he\u2019s leaving, and then take his anger at himself for his stupidity out on you. That\u2019s not who you want to have as a partner throughout life\u2019s ups and downs.", "NTA. This guy is a massive wiener.", "NTA. You mentioned prior experiences making this behavior especially upsetting, so let me start by saying whatever you\u2019ve been through in past (maybe I\u2019m reading into that line too much), you can be certain that your boyfriend\u2019s treatment is all kinds of messed up, and not typical of a healthy relationship. I\u2019ve been through some trauma myself, and the hardest part after was relearning what \u201chealthy\u201d looked like; so many toxic partners are very comfortable claiming their behavior is normal and blaming their partner\u2019s past as somehow clouding their judgment. Don\u2019t let that work on you.\n\nWith that out of the way: you told him he could come back IF he wouldn\u2019t be coming back too late. You didn\u2019t leave him stranded; you maintained a boundary that was communicated well in advance. He didn\u2019t tell you his keys were in his bag because he didn\u2019t want to leave right then to come get then if you\u2019d said \u201cI\u2019ll wait up long enough for you to get them, but I\u2019m going to bed by x time so you need to leave now.\u201d He probably had no difficulty crashing on a friend\u2019s couch, but is using that to try to guilt you for maintaining a boundary he was testing. He knew the rule: be back early enough, or sleep elsewhere. He could have brought his keys if he was unsure how late he\u2019d be; he could have left at a reasonable time; heck, he could have just been honest that he\u2019d decided to stay later, rather than lying to you all night.\n\nThe silent treatment is because he knows that in a real conversation, he\u2019d be in the wrong. He\u2019s hoping that in isolation, your thoughts spiral in his favor. I try not to suggest a breakup without really clear red flags without an alternative perspective that could shift the ruling, but between the lies and his behavior after the fact, I feel very confident telling you you can do better than this guy.", "NTA, And theres no reason to think he didnt have his keys either. .", "NTA\n\nAnd lucky you, he's your ex.", "NTA and he should not have ripped you to shreds. You deserve better. So does your puppy!", "No, your boyfriend repeatedly LIED to you. He repeatedly DISRRESPECTED you and took you for granted.  Rethink being involved with someone with so little consideration. you are NOT an AH.", "NTA!\n\nHow dare he \"rip you to shreds\"! He kept blowing you off and lying to you about leaving. I can understand maybe intending to leave and getting sidetracked once, for a little bit, but he knew your schedule. \n\nMy ex-husband used to do the same kind of thing to me. DARVO and gaslighting galore.\n\nDon't second-guess yourself, or think you're a witch. You're not. If you'd let him come over that late at night, and the pup got hyper and had an accident, it'd somehow be your fault, too, I reckon. Good on you for telling him to go home, not your place.", "This guy lied to you repeatedly and then is punishing you with his silence, which is childish and abusive. I hope he, and all his things, are gone from your apartment. NTA", "NTA", "I feel like you're the asshole here. Given a choice, I would not want to have such a girlfriend. \n\nI pray to God to give you strength.", "NTA.\nAlso, here\u2019s a list of red flags:\n\n1. Saying he\u2019ll be there at a certain time and not coming at that time. Then not giving you a time and lying to you about getting ready to leave.\n\n2. The silent treatment. It\u2019s a form of manipulation to make you feel guilty and give into him.\n\n3. He gets mad at YOU when he flakes on you and is totally disrespectful of your time???\n\n4. This man is almost 40 and he acts like a 12 year old when he doesn\u2019t get his way.\n\nI mean this in the nicest way possible, OP, it\u2019s time to take off the rose tinted glasses. All red flags just look like flags with them on. Do you really want to be with someone who disrespects you like this?", "NTA, and he\u2019s a dick. How selfish can you be? You would be wayyy better without him", "Take the win and continue this no contact forever. This dude doesn\u2019t respect your time or his own time words.

I would recommend you trade it in for a puppy.\n\nSince you already have the puppy just leave the malfunctioning bf unit at the curb for waste disposal.\n\nThe good news is that your puppy will never treat you poorly like that clown did.", "NTA. Your boyfriend said he would be home early ish, then he kept lying to you around his plans to get back. It was on him to advise his keys were in his bag when you said don\u2019t come back here. The silent treatment was unnecessary and immature", "He didn't keep his word to you regarding planned time home. He lied multiple times to cover that up. He failed to mention he didn't have his keys (if your realization is true). He barely said a word to you the next day. He texted a shredder. And you haven't heard from him for a week.\n\nI think you have an **ex**\\-bf, not a bf. And I think you should count your lucky stars!\n\nNTA.", "I was with a guy i loved so much who i was into who told me i was his world and he was so scared to lose me and in the next breath would disappear for ages and end up with sooo many women and when i called him on it he lied and lied until i cornered him into the truth- girl move on he is playing you like a trombone", "NTA.  Keep the dog / re-home the ex boyfriend.", "NTA! This man did not respect your boundaries.", "NTA if he was having a good time hanging out with his boys he should have just said that the first time he was technically late and ask her to but his bag with the keys outside. I don't think he was messing around with you just having fun with the guys", "Oh, no. This is textbook gaslighting behavior. If he'd needed his keys, he could have texted back that he needed to swing by to pick them up. He could have even woken you up. He certainly could have informed you the next day. This leads me to think that he had his keys. \n\nWhat he didn't have was an excuse for constantly lying to you about when he would be leaving. It's obvious that he had no intention of doing so after the first time he said he'd be doing so shortly.\n\nI'm not going to immediately assume that he was with another woman, but I can say that a man who treats his girlfriend with the level of disrespect he showed to you will usually have no compunction about lying to her about anything if it's to his benefit.", "This! This! He is operating out of the cheater's playbook. They all follow the same script/strategies.\n\nSigned,\n\nOne Who Knows", "NTA. BF is TA though", "Happy \ud83c\udf82 day! \ud83e\udd73", "I would leave my keys at home if I were going out drinking - then you can't lose them and I wouldn't need them anyway since I wouldn't be driving. But it does feel weird to be without them.", "He\u2019s a 37year old adult who can\u2019t respect the OP enough to use his big boy words to let her know what was happening, but instead he lied and kept her in limbo for hours. Is he supposed to get a cookie for listening to her when she put her foot down and said to not come? Damn you set that bar real low. \n\nAnd then he gets defensive because he can\u2019t communicate effectively after the fact and acts like an immature teenager.", "Based on your comment, given a choice, one wouldn\u2019t want you as a partner/girlfriend/boyfriend. \n\nOP, NTA.", "When I can't find appropriate translation for the phrase in English forum I usually go to urban dictionary. \ud83d\ude02 My favorite place to find translations :)", "OP... please please listen to everyone else *except* the ridiculous poster with 73 downvotes and dump this awful boyfriend. He's very bad news and will likely get worse.", "I seriously thought this was a high school relationship based on the boyfriend\u2019s behavior. Then I checked his age again. \n\nOP it looks like you have a big maturity difference here between you both. He could use some growing up. Lack of communication and the silent treatment rather than having an actual conversation does not bode well if you continue the relationship. NTA"]}
