He is great about holding & sleeping through the night as long as it is a calm environment. My bf stays over every weekend. He knows my schedule and how I have been operating.\n\nLast Saturday my boyfriend(37m) wanted to go downtown to hangout with his friends on a rooftop bar. I decided to stay home. He asked if he should come back to sleep over or not and I said he could as long as he doesn't come home super late. He said he wouldn't be long, would be back by 8pm. He left at around noon and left his backpack here since he would be returning. I didn't hear from him all day, until about 7pm when bf said he was leaving soon. Then for the next three hours my boyfriend kept saying he would be leaving soon or \"getting ready to leave\". He would lie and say he was walking to the train but then 45 minutes later when he still wasn't here I messaged to see where he was he said they were still hanging out. This behavior was triggering for reasons I won't get into based on past incidents and I felt like he was dicking me around.\n\nAt 10pm I was really aggravated and felt like an ass waiting around. Also I did not want my puppy to wake up and get excited / confused + potentially have an accident when my bf strolled in at god knows what time and then I would have to take him out. We are in a night routine that has been working for us and I don't want to mess with it. So when my bf said yet again \"getting on train soon\", I texted back and said don't come back here, go home, I am going to sleep. My boyfriend did not reply.\n\nThe next day he came to get his bag and left without barely saying a word. Afterwards he texted me saying I left him stranded and just ripped me to shreds. Since then I haven't heard from him, it's been a week and I am getting the silent treatment.\n\nAfter thinking about it I realized he must have left his house keys in his backpack. How was I to know? I wish he had just told me that instead of immediately turning silent on Saturday night when I told him not to come back here. I would have left his bag outside my door if he needed his keys. So the lack of communication and immediately turning sullen I don't get.\n\nAITA? I kind of feel like a witch based on my bf's treatment on me right now so maybe I was being unnecessarily harsh and unreasonable.", "created_utc": 1682190606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12vfyab/aita_for_not_letting_my_boyfriend_back_into_my/", "score": 245, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Wake up!! NTA and find a man who treats you like the partner you deserve.", "NTA- also red flags you should definitely reconsider especially with the lack of communication on his part. Then proceeded to act like a child and give you the silent treatment. THEN proceeded to rip you apart when all he had to do was communicate his keys could have potentially been in the bag", "NTA. Dump his ass.", "NTA for what you did, he's clearly TA for lying to you over and over again for hours and then being a child grabbing his bag and leaving instead of talking to you like an adult. Why be with someone who has such little respect for you?", "NTA. Your 37 year old boyfriend is acting like a baby. There\u2019s no reason why he couldn\u2019t have just told you that he left his keys in his backpack and needed to come get them at your place.", "NTA. You told him the conditions and he accepted them. If his house keys were in the backpack then he should have told you that so you could leave them out. More than likely, he forgot he didn't have his keys on him until it was very late or he got home. He is blaming you and acting like a child.", "NTA, he\u2019s 37 not 7.", "NTA.  He has no respect for you and it was his own stupid fault that he left his house keys. What adult goes anywhere without their house key?  Get rid of him.", "NTA \n\nHe was lying to you repeatedly for hours.\n\nHe also could have used his big manly words and said \" i left my house keys in my back pack\" and worked out a compromise so he \"wouldnt be stranded\"\n\nMy guess is he did something to feel guilty about, in addition to lying to you multiple times so he thought you were going to call him out, so he went offensive using his rage as a deterrent from you asking what was going on the prior night \n\nMaybe im wrong,  but for sure he was not a contrite apologetic BF saying he is sorry, hope you will forgive him for not sticking to what he said & he would like to make it up to you.  Which are all things he shouldve been doing \n\nDont know what his deal is but you deserve better. It is better to be alone than to be with someone who treats you badly& takes you for granted.", "No, NTA.  He's an adult, who should be able to keep his keys in him when he's not home. Expecting to show up (probably drunk) after 10+ hours drinking and hanging out is foolish. Like, he blew you off the entire day and thought nothing of it.", "NTA \n\nYour BF is an inconsiderate d!\u00a9ckhead. He is either really not giving a f*ck or playing games or both. \n\nTelling you for hours that he would be leaving soon and then just partying on is such shitty behaviour. If he showed some kind of remorse or  would appologize at least. But now he is offendend and is sulking about you stranding him. \n\nPlay stupid games win stupid prizes...", "NTA, and you fell for his game of finding a way to make you the bad guy so you won't hold him accountable for his behavior. Kick him to the curb", "You're still calling someone your boyfriend after they've been giving you the silent treatment for a week? Bold. \n\nNTA", "NTA. He kept jerking you around on what time he was coming home and then gave you the silent treatment? He\u2019s the one being immature and not communicating his needs. Giving someone the silent treatment is a form of psychological abuse and you shouldn\u2019t tolerate it. If it were me I\u2019d cut ties with him because he\u2019s being immature and non communicative and acting like a child.", "NTA.  Should you have told him earlier?  Yeah, maybe.  But he is the bigger asshole here.", "Girl, the red flags are all over your post. Obvs NTA. Keep the puppy, kick the bf.", "NTA\n\nHe shows no remorse for not keeping his commitment to you and lying repeatedly. Then he blames you for the fact he didn\u2019t simply communicate the problem to you and advocate for himself.", "NTA- you didn\u2019t know he didn\u2019t have his keys with him. what adult doesn\u2019t keep their keys on them at all times? telling him to go home wasn\u2019t wrong. it\u2019s not that big of a deal, you would see each other the next day. i will say though, i don\u2019t think he was trying to dick you around. us guys do that, a lot of things happen when we try to leave the bar. friends keep trying to talk to us and then time slips away, and before you know it 2 hours have gone by. then again he was not communicating well at all. he sounds like a jerk honestly.", "NTA and you don't need his lies.", "NTA \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA\nWas your response extreme?  Maybe a little.  But, he's the one who was lying to you all evening, he's the one who didn't respect you or your home.", "[deleted]", "YTA and the relationship is over. Have fun with your dog!", "ESH\n\nI suppose he should have spoken up a bit more, but you know you *did* strand him without warning. You didn't tell him \"ok, but you have to be back by X or I'm going to bed and don't come in\". You said that actually he just can't come. (The dog sounds like a reach. A *major* stretch).\n\nWhat it really sounds like to me is that you were aggrieved that he didn't come home at 8pm, and this was all about punishing him. Only now that you see you maybe might not have a boyfriend, you're starting to regret it.\n\nI can't call him an \"asshole\" for not explaining in detail how you stranded him because when you tell him he cannot come in, it'd be something of a tresspass/home invasion for him to come in anyway. In fact, you're basically criticizing him for respecting your wishes that he not arrive. ***But he really should have used his words***.\n\nIf you like this boyfriend, it might be a good idea to apologize while explaining that he too should learn to use his words.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*\"I would have left his bag outside my door if he needed his keys.\"*\n\nWhat? For anyone to pick up? His bag with his house keys? That's not an offer. He should have used his words, but what I read here says revenge because he didn't get home at 8pm.

He would say he was coming for food, I would cook, food would go uneaten as he didn\u2019t turn up or would be so late he was no longer hungry.

That's not \"blowing her off\". Everything wrong with him failing to explain why he needed to get his stuff back from hers and instead throwing a huge tantrum.", "It wasn't an extreme reaction at all. She told him he could come back if he got there by 8. She already told him this before he played these games.
