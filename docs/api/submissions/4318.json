There can be a nice give and take if it has been previously established between partners how to divvy up housework and how to get someone out of bed early if need be. If I have to be up early the one thing that wakes me is my son, he\u2019s persistent and will crawl all over me, pinch my belly fat and pry open my eyes trying to wake up Mommy. If I have to be up early, he takes my son and puts him on my bed and lets him work his toddler magic on me and I\u2019ll be up in ten minutes maximum. This is okay with me. It\u2019s okay with him. It works because I\u2019ll get angry of someone knocks my teeth out slapping me to wake me up or if I wake up in a puddle of ice water that failed the first times cups were thrown on me, but I\u2019ll never get angry at my precious boy for something like that. \n\nYour partner needs to grow up, accept responsibility for his bad habits, make the required changes to keep his family and his current home life and then STICK TO THEM. If he doesn\u2019t? You need to leave, girl. Yesterday. \n\nNTA", "NTA there are consequences to our every day choices. Missing events if you stay up playing video games is a consequence to that choice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen you do need to wake him up though frozen marble works every time. Sheer evil because if he tries to move away from them they roll and follow him. He'll be awake and up in no time - probably not happy about it but he'll be up.", "NTA - would love an update on how it played out when he did wake up tho\u2026", "NTA - set the expectation first (I'm not going to wake you up anymore.  You have an alarm.  If you aren't ready when it's time to leave, I'm leaving without you.) and then follow through.  I'd go to the wedding by myself just to make the point.\n\nAs for the baby, I agree with the other posters, wake his ass up.  Push him out of bed if necessary, but he needs to be a parent.", "Speaking as someone who has time management issues and is perpetually 15 min late to everything, NTA. No matter how early I go to sleep, how many alarms I set, how loud they are or what ring tone I use, I even give myself 3 hours to get ready when I only need 1 + 1/2. It\u2019s really just impossible for me and I\u2019ve been trying to find solutions for years. And you know what, when my mom gets mad at me because she has trouble waking me up (I\u2019m 17), I can\u2019t blame her because it is a big problem. \n\nYour husband cannot have his cake and eat it too. He can\u2019t stay up until 5am playing games and then get upset when his wife doesn\u2019t baby him by waking him up. He has responsibilities as an adult, a husband, and a parent and he needs to have some accountability here. I 100% understand how hard it is, but the video games is one very obvious step he can take towards fixing this issue.", "NTA", "YTA\n\nFor stiffing the bride and groom money they paid for your dinners. \n\nYou should have told him in advance you will no longer wake him, and not do it randomly and on an important date. \n\nHe has a reversed sleep cycle. Daytime is middle of the night for him. I\u2019d never date a gamer that\u2019s for sure. Good luck with that.", "The problem is when he explains he is going to blame her, instead of telling the truth that the fault is his. \n\nI would simply if I had access to a phone number or social media account for the couple send a message and explain \" I am sorry we won't be attending your wedding today. I tried waking husband up, he has turned his alarm off several times already, and still refuses to get up. He stayed up until 5 am playing video games. I just wanted to thank you for the invite, and let you know it is nothing personal, but we just won't be making it today. Hope you have a beautiful wedding, and congratulations. \"\n\nThen everyone knows the real reason, and he suffers the consequences, and she dont get the blame.", "Yeah \u201cvideo games until dawn when I have a wedding to go to\u201d can\u2019t be the only manifestation of this impulse control issue.", "Nobody wants to read that, much mess on their wedding day. It makes both of them look ridiculous."]}
