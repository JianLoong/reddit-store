We\u2019ve been honestly super healthy and great together but we hit a snag and it doesn\u2019t seem like we\u2019ve really moved past it. I am a really big fan of the band Red Hot Chili Peppers and have been since I was a kid. I remember driving to school with my dad in elementary school and listening to Stadium Arcadium as it had just come out at the time and this is a fond memory of my childhood and my liking of the band has continued to this day. When I first started dating my gf we were driving to a date and I played some RHCP in my car and she asked politely if I could turn it off. I assumed she just didn\u2019t like RHCP and I did but not before asking why, I could see her tearing up and she started talking about how it was one of her childhood friend\u2019s favorite band before she sadly passed away from an OD when they were 15 (very very scary, please stay away from drugs). I could tell she never really got the chance to move past it so I agreed to turn it off. I\u2019ve usually avoided playing it while I\u2019m around her although occasionally it will come on my playlist and sometimes she will ask (always politely) for me to turn it off. Well fast forward to now and the end of year slideshow comes up on my music app and lo and behold RHCP was my number one artist of the year. I put it on my social media story and made a joke about how Steely Dan was snubbed and now I get the sense that something is bothering her. I asked her what was up and she said that she wishes I didn\u2019t listen to the Chili Peppers so much because of how sad it makes her. I told her I understood how she was feeling but reminded her that she can\u2019t hold onto her sadness forever and that a lot has changed over the past 11 years since her friend died. I also told her that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very fair that I can\u2019t listen to my favorite band because of sadness that she\u2019s holding onto since far before I ever met her. She somewhat agreed with me but said that I was being insensitive and she needs more time to work through it before we start listening to the Chili Peppers again. I know this all sounds frivolous but RHCP is my favorite band of all time and something I\u2019d ideally like to share with my gf.

You two need to learn to agree to disagree about RHCP!!", "NAH? ESH? Idk on this one for sure, I feel like I need to know more specifically what she is wanting.\n\nIf she just wants you to not play their songs around her specifically, sucks, but I think YTA if you don\u2019t. Even though I DO think that if just hearing a song after 11 years hurts that much she needs to be working on it in therapy. She is not at all to blame for her grief and reaction, but it\u2019s also not a healthy response after so long I feel.\n\nIf she wants you to stop listening to RHCP when you\u2019re by yourself or with others, her problem is extreme and she\u2019s putting it on you, at which point NTA and she definitely is.", "ESH . She has the right to grieve how she wants, even if its 11 years later. If listening to their music makes her uncomfortable you will just have to accept that it may be something that you will never get to share with her. thus telling her thet she needs to get over it, or that \"she cant hold on to her sadness forever\" is insensitive.\n\nThat being said, she also has no right to tell you what music you can listen to or enjoy when you are not with her.", "NAH. She has sad memories associated with the band, and you have good ones. She shouldn't make you quit listening, but you shouldn't make her listen. Maybe work on a compromise together.", "INFO: So her problem is that she doesn't want you listening to them at all whether she is around or not? Or she just doesn't want you listening while she is around? At the beginning it sounded like it was just if she's around. But then you posted about them being your #1 listened to artist and she got in her feels about it. So I'm just wondering about the dynamic here before I pass judgement.", "Let's say this isn't about grief.  Me and my husband, we have quite a lot of common music tastes.  But there is plenty of pop music that I love and he can't stand.  And some of his favourite music is heavy metal, and it's just not for me.\n\nI'm never going to tell him he can't ever listen to heavy metal, but I'm also not going to have it blasting in the car giving me a headache.  And by the same token, I'm not subjecting him to pop music he can't stand.\n\nThis year I recently lost a close friend very suddenly when he unalived himself.  And for me it's obviously still fresh, but if in 11 years time I'm still crying on his birthday, I know my husband will support me, not tell me to get over it.  \n\nThey're a band, that's it.  Listen to them as much as you want on your own, but playing them with your girlfriend is just emotionally hurting her.  Is a band really worth prioritising over your girlfriends grief?", "NTA but she needs therapy, she has unresolved grief that she is dealing with in the wrong way.  \nTry to be understanding, although many years have passed, she was just 15 when it happened", "We all grieve differently, but 11 years is a long time to grieve like this.  If she's experiencing this much sadness whenever a song comes on, she probably should be talking to a therapist about it.  I'm going to say NAH.  For whatever reason, this death in her childhood hit her very hard and she's never gotten past it.  It is unfair to you that you can't listen to your favorite music, but I can't fault her over her trauma (and she didn't sound disrespectful).  However, she needs to deal with it.", "The band is a positive trigger for you and a negative trigger for her. If you truly love this band like it seems like you do, I don\u2019t think the relationship will end up working out", "YTA. telling someone they need to get over their grief so you can share your favorite band with them is insensitive. \"I don't like to listen to a particular band because it reminds me of my dead friend\" is a pretty minor form of grieving. \n\nBased on your post, this band is so important to you that you feel like a prerequisite of your relationship is sharing it with your partner. If sharing this band with your partner is so important to you, you probably need to find a different partner.", ">she said that she wishes I didn\u2019t listen to the Chili Peppers so much because of how sad it makes her.\n\nINFO - Are you listening to them around her? Or does she not want you to listen to them at all?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>\\[I\\] reminded her that she can\u2019t hold onto her sadness forever and that a lot has changed over the past 11 years since her friend died.\n\nThis is incredibly insensitive.

You absolutely should be able to listen to them on your own time, with friends, whatever. But you would be a massive arsehole if you try to push this on to her. Smells and sounds can be incredibly powerful triggers for memories. She may never be able to listen to RHCP ever again without feeling upset. Such is life. In the grand scheme of things, is that really something to damage your relationship over? \n\nJudgement will depend on the answers to the above INFO.\n\nIf she doesn't want you to listen at all even if she's not around then ESH - her for being ridiculous, and you for being an insensitive arsehole for your comments.\n\nIf she doesn't want you to listen around her then YTA - both for trying to force the music on to her knowing how and why it uspets her, and also for the insensitive arsehole comments.", "It's been 20 years since one of my best friends passed away, and I'll be d*mned if anybody is going to tell me not to grieve him. Mention Hawaii, and I'm going to think of the 808 area code, and it's going to take me to the song 808, and I'm gonna think back to the bus singing it with him. Also the fact that he wanted to drive a bus. I may not get emotional over everyday things anymore, but I certainly wouldn't be playing 808 on a remix even if it were even vaguely popular.", "First of all, paragraphs are your friend. Use them.\n\nSecond, if Red Hot Chili Peppers saddens your girlfriend, play their songs when she's not around. Play some other music when she's with you.\n\nProblem solved.\n\nHowever, YTA for telling your girlfriend to \"get over\" the death of her friend. I had a college friend who died of brain tumor. It's been more than 20 years ago. Now, there aren't any songs or music groups that are *verboten*, but I still miss her dearly.", "Yep. YTA. You can listen to RHCP all you want when you are not with her. But she is likely to never get over associating them with her dead friend so you should not subject her to them. Take them out of your regular playlist. Listen to them when you are alone. Do not tell her how to grieve. My father died decades ago, I still cry when I hear his favorite song.", "YTA.  \n\n\nThere is no deadline for grief - there's no cut-off where things are just magically better.\n\nYour GF went through the trauma of losing a very close friend at a very young age, that's not something you just get over. Yes, a lot HAS changed in the 11 years since that time, but that's 11 years without her friend, 11 years of your GF growing up without a friend she probably thought she'd always have. 11 years that will turn into more years without her, and all the things her friend won't be there for; won't get to do. That's A LOT.\n\nThe RHCP are pretty awesome, but is your love for them the hill you want your relationship to die on? Because that's def. going to happen if you keep being an insensitive AH. Listen to the RHCP on your time, and understand that it's a trigger for your GF's very deep grief for her friend.\n\nYour GF might benefit from talking with a therapist not only about her grief, but about your relationship as well and how maybe she deserves a sensitive BF who doesn't put his love for a band before her.", "This is a classic ESH\n\nAsking someone not to listen to their favorite band because of an incident from before you were dating is manipulative and dumb. It sounds like you tend not to listen to it around her and instead only do so on your own time. That\u2019s totally acceptable. \n\nThat being said yeah it was a dick move to tell her it was a long time ago and to move on. A guy I knew and was lukewarm to in high school died from ODing as an adult and even though he wasn\u2019t my favorite person it still makes me super sad to think about that situation, especially his family. Dude wasn\u2019t even 30. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine what it\u2019s like to lose a friend at half that age. So yeah the way you phrased your response to her was super insensitive.", "YTA- instead of telling her to get over it, she needs support in order to deal with her emotions and process it. You don\u2019t just get over stuff, somethings need therapy, time and healing. It comes across like the RHCP are more important to you than your GF mental wellbeing\u2026 perhaps support her in getting help and working through it? You may then find you can share in your fav band at some point - but right now it\u2019s total selfishness on your part. Help her get support.", "ESH - she doesnt want to feel like she did back then \n\nYou can listen to whatever you want and it really doesnt impact her. You dont get to just tell her to \u201cget over it\u201d", "11 years to grieve? Idk, I get that people grieve and mourn differently but that shouldn\u2019t be justifiable for her to get you to quit listening/enjoying something you like.", "NTA.  I know grief is individual to every person, but your gf cannot expect you to never listen to your favorite band from childhood.  You can try to be sensitive and limit her exposure, but you should not have to stop enjoying THCP altogether.", "NTA for wanting to listen to your favorite band but your gf isn\u2019t the AH for grieving her friend. Can you agree not to listen to it with her but rather on your own time? I don\u2019t see why you shouldn\u2019t listen to them at all. However, this may not be something she wants to share with you and that\u2019s okay. Why would you want to force it when it makes her sad? That\u2019s not a fun experience to share.", "I don\u2019t think she can dictate what you listen to on your own but if it brings up painful memories I don\u2019t think this is something you can share together.

My cousin died 20 years ago in a sudden and traumatic bout with cancer as a teenager. I was the same age as her and it really deeply affected me. At her memorial a popular song that is often played at weddings/ memorials/ graduations/ etc, played several times. I still to this day absolutely hate that song and it makes me tear up every time I hear it. I rarely think of my cousin anymore- not because I don\u2019t care, but because most of the grief has passed with time, but I really hate hearing that song. It\u2019s been decades and I still can\u2019t imagine ever wanting or choosing to listen to that song. Your gf can\u2019t tell you what songs to listen to or post on your own social media, but I don\u2019t think you will be sharing that band as a couple, and I think you should work on having some acceptance about that if you want to stay together.

There really is no more to say.", "NTA because it sounds like she doesn't want you to listen to RCHP even in private which is extreme.\n\nYTA for wanting to get your girlfriend to listen to the RCHP because they suck ass. And also she's traumatized about it.", "NTA. It's fine for her to ask you not to listen to your favorite band in her presence, but asking you to never listen to them is out of bounds.", "YTA. My twin brother died 22 years ago and certain songs still make me cry because they bring me back to memories of him. I cry because I love him. I cry because I miss him. And I cry because music has the ability to trigger traumatic memories and cause emotional flashbacks (I also have diagnosed PTSD from other stuff but I can see how the experience of a PTSD emotional flashback is not all that different than how intense my emotions get about losing my brother). These experiences are intense. And I have grieved- but music is powerful.\n\nI agree that you should be able to listen to what you want but telling her to get over it is a real dick move. How hard is it to have some compassion for this person you supposedly love?", "red hot chili peppers is one of my absolute favorite restaurants and if y\u2019all ever get a chance you should go", "Yea I would be fully on his side if he hadn't made that \"you can't hold onto your sadness forever\" comment. Some people never really \"get over\" losing a loved one (especially if they died tragically or there were unresolved feelings/things left unsaid) and it isn't realistic (or kind) to expect them to. That song may always be triggering for her. \n\nOP has the right to listen to what he wants and it's disrespectful for his GF to try to control him like that even if she is doing it out of grief. He shouldn't listen to the band when she's around since it obviously makes her upset. They're going to have to figure out some kind of compromise that doesn't involve forcing the other person to do something that makes them feel uncomfortable/disrespected.", "Exactly! There is no way she can decide what you listen to on headphones, in your car, or when she is not around. If you are a considerate person, you don't listen to it around her. And you certainly don't get to lecture her on how to handle her grief. And you can't expect her to ever want to listen to it again.\n\nFor reference: I was at the Pearl Jam concert on Roskilde Festival in 2000 where 9 people died. I have not been able to listen to Pearl Jam until a year or so ago. I was not close to the front where it happened, was not crushed or physically uncomfortable and I did not know any of the deceased persons. Anyone asking me to get over it would have been met with some not very nice words.", "Agree.

Or say you wished they didn\u2019t listen to them or anything like that?
