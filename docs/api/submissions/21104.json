If your medication goes missing, you don't just get to get more, until the date of your next refill. Usually it's 30 days. Looks like that would be 6 months for you, even if you had the money.\n\nMost likely, you're going to need to call the police. Then, you'll have proof that your medication really was taken and could get what you need.\n\nAnd I'd get on that right away if I were you. Bipolar+No Meds usually =hell.", "NTA go to the police girl", "OP, call the police and your doctor.  Please update to let us know you're OK. I'm so sorry you're family sucks.  Hopefully your friend and friends family will support you through this.", "Reach out to your local legal resources, like legal aid, your state\u2019s lawyer referral line, or freelegalanswers.org.  NTA.", "Aunt is absolutely insane. Abrupt withdrawal from most of those medications can cause life-threatening effects. Not only has she stolen your prescribed medication, but she's put you, potentially, in actual physical and mental danger.\n\nStay far away from her and her enablers/excusers, file a police report, and good luck on getting your meds sorted out. NTA.", "NTA - call the cops, your aunt just put your life in danger.", "Definitely NTA. What your aunt did is basically reckless endangerment. Certain medications, particularly antipsychotics and antidepressants, have pretty bad withdrawal symptoms if you abruptly cold turkey. Symptoms that could possibly lead to hospitalization (ex seizures with benzodiazepines). \n\nDid you contact your health insurance and doctor about this and explain the situation?\n\nYour aunt and your family are T A. I am so mad for you.", "File a police report. Right now. You can do it at the station or even online. But in person is faster. If you want, you can also call their non emergency line to request an officer to take your report.", "File police report, she's awful.", "Are you in the US?  I\u2019ve been a pharmacy technician for over 15 years - I\u2019ve NEVER heard of an insurance company approving a six month prescription.  The most they\u2019ll ever do is three months, and then you call for refills.\n\nWhy did a nurse drop off your medication?  How did they get access to such a large quantity of medication?  The only place you\u2019d be able to get that much medication is from a pharmacy - whether it\u2019s outpatient, mail order, or retail.  How was this nurse able to pick up a prescription that didn\u2019t belong to them?\n\nYou seem to be well aware of your aunt\u2019s attitude toward medication.  So why would you leave it unguarded?  Why wasn\u2019t it with you at all times?\n\nI\u2019m calling fake.", "NTA, \"Just get new medication\" are your relatives aware of this little thing called money?", "Asking for a friend, where are people buying mood stabilizers and antidepressants for thousands of dollars on the street?", "Show your relatives the bill for the new drugs and ask who\u2019s coughing up. Change their attitudes real fast.", "And some people are just religious nutters, which is the vibe I'm getting with the family backing up the aunt", "Ayep. It's very dangerous. Even if OP doesn't want to file a police report, probably will have to. \n\nDocs are going to be leery about writing a script for another 6 month supply on a story that an aunt tossed it. Unless there is a copy of the police report.", "As someone who has Bipolar mixed episodes with bipolar depression and can attest that going off your mood stabilizers AT ALL never mind cold turkey is a dangerous and horrible experience m. Since my mood is stabilized by my medication when I have even just missed a few doses I start to either slide into depression (most likely) or get mania, which is somehow worse to me. I would file a report and tell the nurse IMMEDIATELY what happened so they can get some medication possibly.", "As much as 1 day without her meds can make my wife start feeling like shit. There are also some crazy expensive meds out there. If it wasn't for Cost plus just 1 month of 1 of her meds would be almost $200. 6 months worth of meds could easily be over $1200.", "Pharmacist here to third on this.", "Agree 110%. Hopefully, OP will get her medication & a safe place to stay (maybe the nurse can help her with that too).", "I was also thinking that OP may want to tell their pharmacy that the aunt is not approved to pick up their medication just in case she tries something more drastic. Is that something you\u2019d recommend as a pharmacist?", "Call insurance and let them know that meds were maliciously thrown out. They may give a one time override for an early refill.", "Police report will be needed", "Not necessarily.\n\nEdit: to explain, if OP is not taking controls, no report is needed. If OP is taking common first lines like quetiapine and fluoxetine, they\u2019ll be fine. Insurance may still not even ask if OP is on benzodiazepines since they aren\u2019t CIIs, but possibly may still ask. It depends on who you talk to and the insurance company policies."]}
