I just checked goodRX for pricing and both  generic Seroquel and Abilify are less $30 a month where I live (at some pharmacies). Also check cash prices at owner operated pharmacies, they tend to have more flexibility on pricing than the big chains. I mention the price in case it takes to long to get insurance straightened out. Maybe you can get a partial until you can get the refill/insurance side of thing straightened out.\n\nI\u2019d tell you to bring your aunt to my clinic so I could tear her a new asshole, but you have more important things to do. She is also probably a hopeless case if she thinks needing non addictive medication makes you an addict. I expect that anyone with medical training that hears this story will be horrified at  your aunt\u2019s behavior and outraged on your behalf. I am fuming by the way (nurse practitioner, but not YOUR nurse practitioner). \n\nNTA", "REPORT HER TOTHE POLICE!!!!", "Go to the police. You need your meds.", "Call the cops. Your family sucks ass", "NTA. You need to contact the police and your doctor and report this.", "Easy tell her to get it back or your calling the police. If she doesn't follow through and call them. Remind her that items stolen over usually on average 200 dollars is considered a felony charge.", "NTA and file a police report", "NTA, I would call the police on her.", "[removed]", "Good point.", "Seroquel is very popular in prisons, in my country, recreationally however doctors don't subscribe it much anymore. The damage to people's metabolism is too extreme.", "God, I was on duloxetine for fibromyalgia and it made my mental panic attacks so much worse. Ironically, 60mg of oxycodone twice a day has been more effective than anything else and doesn't completely fuck me up with withdrawal, even after 7 years of taking it. \n\nJust have to check in once every now and then and my doctor is totally happy to give me what I ask for in reason.", "When I first started taking it my doctor told me I would feel like dying for the first 2-3 weeks. He was not wrong. I was also sick to my stomach and had no appetite for nearly 3 weeks. I stuck with it because my fibro pain was also brutal and that started getting better within a few days. Thankfully once that initial adjustment period was over, I don't have any side effects from it. But brutal is the perfect way to describe the first few weeks.", "Depends on the person. Genetics absolutely influence how individuals respond to meds. \n\nThat said, I hated duloxetine. I would have random surges of anger and tearfulness, which isn\u2019t great if you have depression secondary to ptsd and untreated adhd.", "I'm not saying you shouldn't take it if it helps you but it didn't have any noticeable positive effects while I was puking my guts up every day so I had to give up on it.", "I\u2019m a 4th year Med student, will be an MD in about 8 months, and got a 97th percentile score on my psych shelf exam. If you told any doctor in existence about how gabapentin is used for bipolar disorder, they\u2019d think you\u2019re an idiot google warrior (not me tho, I\u2019m nicer and would just think you\u2019re deeply misguided). \n\nOff the top of my head, I know gabapentin is used most often for RLS and chronic neuropathic pain; it\u2019s not going to do much, if anything, for mania. Honestly can\u2019t even remember the last time I\u2019ve seen it prescribed to a non-diabetic.", "Use for bipolar is listed in the British National Formulary (on paper).  I didn't bother googling."]}
