I get kids needing to figure things out for themselves and no doubt the kid was told to not climb the tree in the first place; but it\u2019s far better for the parents to work with the kid to problem solve. The kid was probably scared and panicking and if they had been crying, in no emotional state to think rationally to fox the problem. Parents are arseholes, you are not.", "NTA\nEven if this was the fifth time that week that he had gotten stuck in a tree, the parents should have stayed by his side to help him figure it out. Actually especially if that way the case.\nWhen kids cry and their parents sit in the car there's so much emotion involved that blocks clear thinking. There's so many ways to help a child find a solution, that's no excuse for just ignoring them.", "AFTER 45 MINUTES?\n\nYou really should have called the cops - that is abuse/neglect/ being a terminal AH right there.\n\nNTA for helping the kid. But really - call authorities next time as well", "NTA.\n\nI would have taken it a step further and called the police. No decent parent leaves their minor child stuck in a tree for almost an hour.", "NTA. I\u2019m a parent. I was ready to call you an AH but the poor kid was stuck for 45 minutes??!! Nope. I\u2019m down with the \u201chey you got yourself into that, let\u2019s see you try and figure out how to get OUT of that\u201d concept for a few minutes. After that, get off your lazy butt and help your child!!! Thanks for looking out for that kiddo!", "NTA the only thing his parents taught him that day was that his parents are not liable and are bad people.", "NTA. I would got the parents' number plate and reported to the local safeguarding team. If it was genuinely 45mins that\u2019s so bad. Even worse that no one else helped before then.", "NTA. He was stuck. That\u2019s not a \u201clearning time\u201d that\u2019s a \u201cget him out before he breaks his bloody leg in a panic\u201d.", "NTA.\n\nHis parents probably also don't fix all of their own problems without help of others. Asking someone for help is also a way of fixing things. All these parents are doing is teaching the child that it cannot count on them. Which, in my opinion, is a lousy message to give to your child.", "NTA- A lesson for a kid under the age of 10 should be limited to a few minutes of them trying to figure it out on their own. Once they get desperate, its time to parent and then explain to them the conseuqneces of not listening or whatever the lesson is.   \n\n\nYou are an awful parent if you essentially leave them there and are giving off major insecure attachment issues that will haunt this kid his whole life.", "NTA 45 minutes is too long. I can\u2019t imagine being that mean to my own child. Terrible parents", "NTA, next time report the parents to social services.", "NTA. That poor kid. I can't imagine your parents just watching you struggle for an hour like this.", "NTA.\n\nabusive parents lol", "NTA.  His parents were though.  There are times that children do need to figure things out for themselves, but I don't think that was one of them.  I'm a bit disheartened that the boy was there for 45 minutes and you were the only one willing to help him.", "NTA!  His parents are TAs!  He obviously had been there stuck before you arrived in the first place.  45 minutes he was still there - stuck.  This is abuse by the parents and is definitely reportable.  I don't want to imagine what happens inside the closed doors of their home.   \n Absolutely heartbreaking.  You did a good thing that the child will remember forever.", "NTA. I genuinely understand the parents original sentiment, but 45 minutes?! Get a grip. Those parents suck", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They were clueless and you were kind.", "NTA. And the kid did figure it out. He asked for help, which is actually a skill we should all have.", "NTA. You should\u2019ve called the police on them though.", "NTA. Yes kids should make an effort to fix problems they created as everyone should learn how to deal with the consequences of their own actions. But making the poor kid suffer for 45+ minutes at that age is just cruel.  All they've taught him is that he can't count on them. Hopefully he'll remember the lesson you taught him, that even though his parents suck there are some decent people out there too.", "NTA the way I would\u2019ve called the cops on them so fast , they was just gonna let him stay there for how long ?!?", "NTA for helping the kid out at all. I would say that it also would not have been an asshole move to take video of the incident and report it because their tactic is abusive. If they're willing to do that crap in public I worry about what other \"valuable lessons\" they make the kid go through at home.", "That's how you end up breaking your ankle. Like, this isn't just fearmongering, getting your foot stuck in a tree is the easiest way to break something, especially as a child. \n\nHis parents should be ashamed of themselves. NTA.", "NTA. Sure if my kid is in a pickle that they are capable of getting themself out of, I'll leave them to figure it out, but if they're actually stuck, or need some guidance, I'll either talk them down (if eg theyre stuck up a tree or up a piece of playground) and then say \"see I knew you could do it!\", or I'll physically help them. Definitely not leave them for 45 mins without any assistance.", "NAH\n\nYou helped not knowing the full story.\n\nThey may have told the kid to not climb the trees at the mall (or some such) 100 times and he didn't mind them.  He got stuck so they wanted him to learn a lesson to mind them.", "I 100% agree.\n\nAlso, I'm not a fan of the whole \"you got it in there, you can get out yourself\" thing. Yes, kids should be taught that there are consequences to their actions and of course be given an opportunity to figure things out themselves.\n\nBut letting them struggle and panic for a full 45 minutes? No way. Plus, there's the added element of allowing their kid to be humiliated and panic-stricken in public which is just plain cruel to do to a child.\n\nIn my opinion, it's equally important for a kid to learn to ask for help when they need it.\n\nOP did the right thing and is definitely NTA.", "Exactly. I've insisted my kid try to get herself unstuck/down from things, even when she was crying a bit. But for no more than 5-10 minutes with me *right there*, giving suggestions, reassurance I'm there to catch her, and encouragement. \n\nThese parents aren't \"teaching\" anything except abuse and abandonment. Poor kid. OP is definitely NTA.", "I'm using 45 as a general point, it maybe have been more or less.", "Not trying to start an argument, but I don't think I need to know the full story of why a poor kid is basically trapped while their parents sit in a car.", "Technically, the kid DID solve the problem - he asked someone nice to help - and that someone did help - problem solved.", "I didn't say you did.  That's also why I didn't say you were an AH.  \n\nMost (not all obviously since he was there for maybe 45 mins) people would have done the same thing you did.", "NTA\n\nHis parents are", "Huh? What? Of course OP is NTA, that's the parents who were lucky someone like OP rescued their kid instead of... idk, an influencer who went all TikTok on their asses and made a time-stamped video of the crying kid whose foot is stuck in a tree for over 45 minutes between  arriving and coming out of the store, called CPS and the police on those truly awful excuses for parents and then shared the entire video on TikTok, Youtube, Facebook, Instagram, et cetera, et cetera.", "I swear these parents that I see in public are weird af. Like having your child hanging from a tree for around at least an hour!?! You did the right thing OP.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI really don\u2019t understand why the parents would be yelling at you.

At 45 minutes of being stuck some intervention is required. His parents are idiots.", "NTA, that\u2019s bordering on child abuse", "You should have called the cops.", "YTA.  If he wasn't injured and his parents were there watching...you kinda stuck your nose in where it didn't belong. If the boy was injured then NTA.", "Not to mention depending on how his foot was stuck he could have injured himself more trying to get out.", "As a fully grown adult, there have been several problems i got myself i to i was not able to get myself out of properly with out help.

Thank you for pointing this out.", "Leaving your kid trapped and crying for 45 minutes is not teaching a lesson, it's traumatizing emotional abuse.", "However long it was, calling the authorities to make sure the child wasn't being abused by these 2 sorry excuses for humans would help him even more than getting out of the tree.", "You're right.", "ok", "Parents and kid are SUPER lucky someone with nefarious motives didn't pass by before someone nice did. Kidnappings can happen in the blink of an eye.\n\nNTA at all.", "NTA 45 min is child abuse, not a teaching moment.", "He did solve his own problem, by asking you for help. All he learned is that when he needs help his parents won\u2019t provide it.", "Nta. That\u2019s abuse on the parents part. I hope the next person calls the police because this isn\u2019t the first or last time they torment their child", "NTA... it's worth considering calling the cops on these parents. In that amount of time he could have caused himself considerable injury", "NTA at all, I'd have written down the license plate and reported them for child abuse. \n\nYou also taught him that sometimes when someone gets in trouble, someone else will help you even if they get nothing out of it personally. \n\nThat's an  important thing to teach a kid.", "NTA -  his parents are really troubling", "NTA.  If it was just 5 minutes and the parents were trying to teach him a lesson, that would be one thing.  But after 45 minutes (plus however long he was there before you even got there), would be considered abusive.  \n\nYou did the right thing.  The only other thing I can think of that you've might have done would have been to call the police.", "No. You did what any normal person would do.", "NTA", "NTA.  He did figure out the solution to his problem.  Ask a stranger for help since he can't rely on his parents.", "Appropriate \u2018tough love\u2019 from a parent would be giving the kid a minute or two to try and get it out and then helping them, what that did was horrible and abusive.\n\nIn no way shape or form is helping a kid who has been stuck for almost an hour wrong.

If its been 45 minutes and the kid is still stuck they totally could have gotten out of the car and at least talked him through getting out. Smh.", "NTA. You should have rang child services or whatever they are called where you live, that\u2019s bad parenting", "NTA also NTA if you popped that dad in the mouth", "Nta. I work with kids who literally get stuck in trees daily. I do encourage them to get out by themselves, but if they can't after 2-3 minutes it's time to step in.", "Also depending on how he got his foot stuck, it might be really difficult to get out.\n\nThere's a few kids in the school I work at that got their feet stuck between bars that hold up playground equipment - if the soles of their shoes bend sideways with the pressure of standing on the edges of the bars, it's sometimes impossible to get the foot out without taking off the shoe.", "Or what about swelling? What if it had swollen to the point where he COULDN'T get it out himself?", "\u201cYou got it in there, you can get it out yourself\u201d only works if you\u2019re willing to take the time to help the child learn. You sit down at their level and ask \u201chow did you get it in?\u201d and then talking through how to reverse those actions to free themselves and helping show them. Kids need to learn that actions have consequences but that\u2019s only half the lesson, you also need to teach them how to make things right, and just like any other lesson in life a lot of the time they won\u2019t comprehend it until it\u2019s been done more than once.", "I remember when my little sister was 3, she was jumping in front of me excited cause we were setting up things for a goldfish. You probably can see already where this is going... yes,she ended up with her head stuck inside the aquarium like the least practical astronaut suit ever. \n\n\n\nIt was honestly 20 seconds of struggle but I was so panicked and afraid of she getting hurt, having trouble breathing or even idk, getting trauma or something. The idea of those \"parents\" sitting there for at least a whole hour watching their kid cry and beg for help honestly send chills down my spine, those are people that had no business in raising children.", "Nta", "NTA. You shown this kid a great lesson, sometimes you need help and you need to ask gor.", "Nta its just abuse at that point.

The idea that if you let your kids out of your sight for one minute while they\u2019re in public they\u2019re going to be snatched up is just not true.", "Adam Walsh was kidnapped and killed by a stranger in a mall. Is your kid much much much much much much much much much more likely to be harmed by someone they know? Yes. Do predators never kidnap and kill kids they don't know? Not even close.", "Nta, these people are neglectful and cruel. There's nothing wrong with asking for help and that poor child needed it.", "NTA, kid did fix his own problems by asking for help. Asking for help is a valid step.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo his parents buy groceries from the store? They should fix their own problems and grow their own. Do they fix their own car too instead of not fixing their own problems by taking it to a mechanic?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen my kids get themselves into a sticky situation I don't swoop in and fix everything. I walk in and give them advice, spot for them (climbing for instance, where to put your foot, etc), ya know.. it's called 'being a parent'.   \nIF my kid got stuck in a tree i'd guide them out, calm them, allow them to relax and use their brains. 45 minutes stuck in a tree? that's about 43 minutes too long.", "NTA\n\nWhen my oldest was two another toddler held her down on a cement splash pad next to one of the sprayers - I went to intervene and the dad grabbed my wrist and said \"we aren't helicopter parents, kids have to figure there own thing out\". By the time I'd convinced him to let go of my wrist my daughter had gotten free and was running crying towards me.\n\nI encourage my kids to figure their own stuff out when appropriate but there are certain situations when intervention is the right thing to do.", "NTA,  you dud the tight thing. The poor kid stuck for 45 minutes...his parents are abusive", "This. I have kids and will give them a minute to get their feet unstuck in these situations, but then I step in. These parents were just being cruel. I doubt this was a one time bad parenting decision, based on their reaction.\n\nOP, you did a good thing. Some people shouldn't be parents.", "Not to mention at that point there\u2019s the risk of strain or soft tissue damage. I usually encourage my kids to figure it out and give suggestions before going over to have a look. But we\u2019re talking a few minutes and not to the point of pain or tears. That\u2019s just neglectful and cruel.", "Yep a fall with his foot lodged could cause the kid to be a very heavy whip.", "It also only works if they actually do know how they got it into that position in the first place. Kid was young, and not a trained climber, I doubt that he was thinking about the position of his foot that much until he realized he was stuck.", "I have a six year old and he\u2019s far from a Rhodes scholar but we\u2019ve been in this exact scenario more than once and I\u2019ve always managed to talk him through it with ease (with some suggestion on my side ie \u201cdo you think maybe that you did xyz? So what do you think would happen if you did abc?\u201d). It also helps your child develop critical thinking and problem solving skills to help them work through doing it themselves. \n\n\u201cI wonder, what If, let\u2019s try\u201d and all that.", "thanks for that, I just heard that last bit in Elmo's voice, lol!", "Yes, it has happened before. But the way we talk about it culturally is as if it\u2019s something that is common and expected and you have to be vigilant against it compared to every other possible problem or health issue. Like, the number of kids kidnapped by strangers every year is similar to the number of kids who die from the flu every year but when you look around a crowded mall are you worried someone is going to give your kid the flu? (Now with covid a lot of people are worried about crowds for germs but for a long time we weren\u2019t!)\n\nYes it happens occasionally but sometimes you get struck by lightning or attacked by a shark or will be walking down the sidewalk not even crossing the street and someone will have a medical emergency while driving and run you over. Anything can happen but it DOES matter what stories we tell ourselves and each other and it is not helpful to maintain the idea that your kids will get snatched up by strangers if you look away from them"]}
