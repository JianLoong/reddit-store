But she always gives me super small portions. Think 10 rigatoni noodles or 4 bites of stroganoff,  not even enough for a snack. I dont want to seem ungrateful, but it has always bothered me. My culture is big on sharing food. guest never leave without an offer for seconds and as much food as they\u2019ll take. You have to be generous, insist people take more, and make them feel like it\u2019s no trouble. So whenever, I pack her anything it\u2019s always a full portion. And so while I really cherish her food , it stings. \n\nSo tonight, I went to my gfs house and on my way out she offered to give me some chilli she made. As expected, it was about 4-6 bites total. Her mom saw the portion and went \u201cwhat? That\u2019s so little what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d And made her go fill up the container. \n\nHere\u2019s where I may be the asshole: \n\nWe discussed this incident on the phone later. Gf called mom overbearing for making her go fill the container. I went ahead and told her it actually did hurt that she always gave me small portions. I made me think that either: she didn\u2019t want to give me any food so gave the smallest portion possible, or she didn\u2019t have enough to be sharing with me so that was all she could give (which I know to be not true). Both make me feel really bad about taking anything. I pointed out the cultural background and that whenever I give her any food it\u2019s always a full portion, so the fact that it\u2019s not reciprocated does hurt. There have been times she offered to make me lunch for work, which ends with me getting a toddler sized meal and having to go hungry. \n\nShe defended herself saying she doesn\u2019t like to give away much if it isn\u2019t as good as she wants it to be (which is was the case with the chilli). She said in her mind giving someone food means sharing a little taster, like a Costco-free sample, and she did it this way because she wouldn\u2019t want someone to be saddled with a full portion of food they didn\u2019t like. I told her while I am grateful and really love her cooking, this is not how most people view offering someone something to eat and pretty poor etiquette, especially to someone from my background.\n\nShe said she understood and was sorry and that she hadn\u2019t just never thought of it from another perspective, but I could tell she was a little upset at the implication that she was being stingy and oblivious to social-norms. I feel like I was justified, but also like TA for complaining about the portion size of free food gifted to me in the first place.

First time I ate breakfast there it was like \"well there are four of us so I only made four pancakes\".  I used to pack snacks in my suitcase when we would go to her house because I was starving.", "Seriously. The HOW she thinks that when literally no one around her is doing that and everyone is in fact doing the opposite is what baffles me. How did she come to the conclusion what she's doing is the norm?", "It can be easy to fix, I kind of understand it from a frugal point of view.  And maybe she has high standards when she cooks.  I personally grew up in my grandfathers house so I hate to waste as well.\n\nTell her with others to be like \"hey, I'm not so sure (I'm insecure about my cooking?) if you're gonna like this, I've cooked better but feel free to have some more if you're good with it.\"\n\nIn your case, if you like her cooking, just tell her.  Ask if it's cool if you take some more afterwards.  She seems like a real hardcore overthinker which isn't always a bad thing.", "OP- are you in anyway on the heavier side? The explanation she gave you just doesn\u2019t hold water for me", "GF isn't right, but I can kind of see where she's coming from.  I can see it going something like this:\n\n* You only want to give your partner food you've cooked if you genuinely think it's good/they'll enjoy it.\n* You and/or your partner is from a culture where it's considered rude to refuse a host's food/not eat everything you're given because it signals they don't like the food/the food is bad.\n* If you think your food is bad, and you give partner a big portion, they'll feel obligated to eat it whether or not they actually enjoy it.\n\nI think it just becomes a weird circle of trying not to offend each other, and it just needed to be plainly hashed out like OP and her GF did.", "Yes this is a new take to me. If someone indicated they didn't like or appreciate my food, they would not get any food.", "No way lol. It\u2019s never an issue when we eat together, she\u2019s always fine with me having as much as I want. It\u2019s only when she brings or packs up food for me to eat later. It\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve had radically different views on social norms - but I did really feel like AH for raising a complaint about food she\u2019s giving me to me as a gift (after all I know I\u2019m not entitled to free food from anyone, even my gf)", "One of the things I miss about the Que.  A small poutine there is a large in Ontario\n\nAlso the beer \ud83d\ude05", "Totally. I know I've held back on gift giving before when I felt like earlier gifts with someone were not well received. \n\nI think this situation might be similar, and she doesn't want to seem presumptuous as labeling herself a cook; she is insecure about her ability to meet op's food needs, so she's holding back before she might be rejected.", "I'm Canadian and usually send people home with a pile of leftovers they can't see over. This isn't culture, it's individual (and weird tbh). She's a bit off somehow in her ideas about food", "I\u2019d pay attention to that hinted insecurity she seems to have around her cooking.\n\nShe seems to be operating on the assumption that people will dislike her food so much that they will only willingly choke down a few bites out of politeness. Where did *that* come  from, I wonder? Is she like that in other ways, too?", "You might want to to think about why this is really going on. This is not a Canadian thing. But if this is going on consistently. I know you said she has no food issues but I would be wondering...", "Or does she think OP is \"too heavy\" and is trying to reduce her food intake to \"help her diet?\" Seems like portion control taken way *way* too far.", "\ud83d\udc80bros mad over pronouns"]}
