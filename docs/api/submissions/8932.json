{"id": 8932, "submission_id": "10rl3in", "title": "AITA for asking my gf for more food?", "selftext": "My (21f) gf (25f) and I both really love to cook, and share what we make with each other all the time. But she always gives me super small portions. Think 10 rigatoni noodles or 4 bites of stroganoff,  not even enough for a snack. I dont want to seem ungrateful, but it has always bothered me. My culture is big on sharing food. guest never leave without an offer for seconds and as much food as they\u2019ll take. You have to be generous, insist people take more, and make them feel like it\u2019s no trouble. So whenever, I pack her anything it\u2019s always a full portion. And so while I really cherish her food , it stings. \n\nSo tonight, I went to my gfs house and on my way out she offered to give me some chilli she made. As expected, it was about 4-6 bites total. Her mom saw the portion and went \u201cwhat? That\u2019s so little what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d And made her go fill up the container. \n\nHere\u2019s where I may be the asshole: \n\nWe discussed this incident on the phone later. Gf called mom overbearing for making her go fill the container. I went ahead and told her it actually did hurt that she always gave me small portions. I made me think that either: she didn\u2019t want to give me any food so gave the smallest portion possible, or she didn\u2019t have enough to be sharing with me so that was all she could give (which I know to be not true). Both make me feel really bad about taking anything. I pointed out the cultural background and that whenever I give her any food it\u2019s always a full portion, so the fact that it\u2019s not reciprocated does hurt. There have been times she offered to make me lunch for work, which ends with me getting a toddler sized meal and having to go hungry. \n\nShe defended herself saying she doesn\u2019t like to give away much if it isn\u2019t as good as she wants it to be (which is was the case with the chilli). She said in her mind giving someone food means sharing a little taster, like a Costco-free sample, and she did it this way because she wouldn\u2019t want someone to be saddled with a full portion of food they didn\u2019t like. I told her while I am grateful and really love her cooking, this is not how most people view offering someone something to eat and pretty poor etiquette, especially to someone from my background.\n\nShe said she understood and was sorry and that she hadn\u2019t just never thought of it from another perspective, but I could tell she was a little upset at the implication that she was being stingy and oblivious to social-norms. I feel like I was justified, but also like TA for complaining about the portion size of free food gifted to me in the first place.

Communication is always important.\nBut the thought of giving out just size \"free samples\" of food is weird, sorry for asking but do either of you have an eating disorder? maybe that's why she's afraid of overfeeding you, because she eats little or wants you to eat less.

Kinda weird but I guess she is insecure about her cooking. You could have also told her sooner, in a less complaining manner like proactively asking her for seconds and letting her know you like eating the food she makes.
