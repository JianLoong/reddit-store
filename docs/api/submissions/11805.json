Yes, even if Kevin has never laid a finger on you or even raised his voice to you. His request isn't just unreasonable, it's OUTRAGEOUSLY inappropriate, deeply unhealthy, and a significant sign that he not only has a controlling temperament and sees you as a possession rather than as a partner and a full-fledged human being in your own right, but that he feels that despite being a grown man, it is YOUR job to ensure that he never has to cope with any insecurities, to protect him from his own feelings, and that it will be your fault if anything even remotely related to you ever makes him feel bad.

It means he doesn't feel responsible for managing his own feelings or controlling his own behaviour . . . he thinks that's your job.\n\nThis adult man didn't even ASK you, but TOLD you (problem #1, because he has no right to EVER tell you what to do; he is your boyfriend, not your parent, and you are not his child) \"to delete pictures from all social media or to get rid of physical pictures that have any ex-boyfriends or ex-lovers\". Read that back: he is trying to make you ERASE YOUR OWN HISTORY, beautiful memories of your past and wonderful things that you experienced . . . just because they happened to have male human beings in them who you had relationships with once-upon-a-time. Relationships that are LONG SINCE OVER. He even asked you to get rid of pictures of your prom, something that happened when you and your date were teenagers . . . basically CHILDREN.  He is being jealous and controlling over something that happened when you were a child, because you experienced it with someone who . . . had an XY chromosome?\n\nOP, you didn't even need to explain as much as you did to us. You WNBTA, you are NTA, you were never the AH in any of this. But this man is dangerously jealous and controlling and is asking you to manage his feelings in ways that are super problematic. Please consider breaking up with him, because this isn't going to get better or safer, it's only going to get worse the longer you stay with him and normalize his behaviour.
