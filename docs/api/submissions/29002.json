One of my students who I had previously invited, who had become a regular presence at the group, forwarded me a piece by somebody who she knew. The piece was exquisite, and I learned the person who wrote it was a finance student that \u2018dabbled\u2019 in writing, so I invited him to the group.\n\nThe aforementioned student of mine and this new addition were in a relationship, and I got the sense both that she was far more into him than he was into her, and that he would sooner rather than later break her heart. That did come to pass, with her coming to my office and telling me that he cheated on her.\n\nThus she demanded he be kicked out of the group. I told her I didn\u2019t choose who can take part on the basis of relationship drama, so she should either avoid him or learn to coexist. She insisted that one of the two of them had to go, so I said she could leave. I did so because frankly, his writing is far better than hers, and truly the best in the group.\n\nShe called me an AH for siding with him over the wronged party, but I don\u2019t think so.
