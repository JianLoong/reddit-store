I have social anxiety and co-dependency problems and I chose dorm life to help me out of my shell, but I go home on the weekends to see my family.\n\nI shared my dorm with Whitney (also 21 F). She was usually a great roommate; I considered her a friend. My friends don\u2019t live on campus, so I never really had anyone visit our dorm, if not to wait for me to grab something from inside before we\u2019re quickly out again. But Whitney had friends over quit often, which I didn\u2019t mind because they usually stayed out in the common area and they weren\u2019t loud. \n\nAs usual, I planned to go home for the weekend and Whitney asked me if one of her friends, Leslie (20 F) could stay on my side of the room for the weekend. I told her of course, and I\u2019ll change my sheets and tidy up my side before I leave. She said thanks and that was that. So I changed my sheets and tidied up. Because of my anxiety, I don\u2019t like leaving personal things around with a stranger, so I also packed up my laptop, my tablet, and my other expensive items to take back home with me for the weekend. \n\nWell, when I got back Sunday night I noticed that my desk drawers and the storage under my bed was not how I left it. A lot of my clothes were unfolded and stuffed back in, and things in desk drawers weren\u2019t organized. I asked Whitney if she went through my stuff perhaps looking for something of hers, and she got clipped with me, confronting me about taking my laptop and my other things like shoes, clothes, and other electronics. \n\nI told her that yes I did take my things. And she asked me why and I told her, honestly, while I knew her I didn\u2019t know her friend, and I didn\u2019t want any of my things stolen or ruined. She yelled at me for not trusting her friend, and I yelled back that I could do whatever I wanted with my stuff and that she had no right to go through my things. It\u2019s very apparent to me now that they were rummaging through my things possibly trying to steal from me or to prove if I trusted them. \n\nWell because of this I took those things, and more, back home for the rest of the semester and Whitney and I did not and still don\u2019t talk. I told my parents about this and they were livid, saying I was in the right to remove my things because it seems my intuition was right and they were trying to steal from me. However, a few of my friends and my sister say that I was in the wrong because my actions came off as rude and passive-aggressive, and that if I didn\u2019t trust her friend, I should\u2019ve said no to her staying over. So I want to know did my actions come across as AH-ish, and would have saying no been better? \n\nI just want to add that before I knew Whitney well enough, I bought back items home with me that I didn\u2019t want her to touch. But once I got to know her, I felt comfortable leaving these things around.", "created_utc": 1685571928, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13x05uf/aita_for_taking_things_home_with_me/", "score": 100, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The idea that you allowed them to adopt your space entirely for that time is really unique. \n\nConsider talking to an RA about finding a new roomie if you and Whitney can\u2019t get past this.

Why would you leave a laptop anyway? Usually I bring my laptop with me when I go places because I\u2019m going to use it over the weekend. It\u2019s weird that they thought you would leave it!

I would take those things with me home just so I could use them during the weekend. It wouldn\u2019t even have anything to do with trust.

It is completely reasonable for you to take your property with you when you went home. You know, like you might want to use them? Study? Go online? Whitney was very much the AH, attempting to turn this back on you for taking your own property with you, plus obviously searching your dresser.", "NTA. I never knew what my roommates took home because I didn't go through their stuff. You were 100 percent correct they had 0 reason to need any of your expensive items.", "And for no other reason than to have it on record with the RA that the roommate went through her stuff.", "He appears to be very right!"]}
