We've been inseparable ever since. When we were about 8 Summer's mom took us to get these really cute friendship bracelets. They're real jewelry, not the kid kind. They were a little big for us back then but we did grow into them perfectly.\n\nWhen I was 10 my dad got remarried and my stepmom came with her own daughter, Elizabeth, who is the same age as me. I don't dislike Elizabeth. We get along fine. But we're not super close either. She wants us to be and she's expressed jealousy toward Summer for years.\n\nElizabeth doesn't have many friends and I don't think any of her friends are actually close. They'll hang out sometimes but they are never there for each other and they don't hang out all that often or act much like friends in general. I think that might be why Elizabeth has so much focus on us being sisters.\n\nI don't mind being around Elizabeth but she and I could never be as close as me and Summer. Summer was there when my mom died and I was there when Summer's brother died. We have pretty much our whole lives with history together and I don't remember a time where I didn't know Summer.\n\nThe jealousy got worse last year when my asthma got really bad. Since then I have been in and out of school and Elizabeth thought it meant I would spend way more time with her than summer. But Summer comes over still.\n\nThe friendship bracelet stuff really kicked off last week though. I'm out of school for a while because we're trying to get my asthma under control and Elizabeth's grandparents are staying with us (my stepmom's parents). Elizabeth had told her grandparents we were BFFs so when they saw the bracelet they assumed it was one to represent the two of us. Elizabeth was like I shouldn't wear it all the time and she said I should have a friendship bracelet with her instead of with Summer. I told her Summer is my BFF though and we've had these since we were little kids. Elizabeth said she doesn't care and she said it's wrong for me to wear it when I know how she feels.\n\nMy stepmom spoke to Elizabeth after one outburst a few days ago was heard by everyone at home. She told her that I'm allowed to have a best friend and she should focus on her own friendships. \n\nMy dad checked in on me and tried to figure out if a compromise might be possible where Elizabeth and I have our own thing. But we're not close enough for that and I told him so. He then asked me if it was possible some of the reason I don't feel very strongly toward her is because of his and my stepmom's rocky relationship and I said I wasn't sure but maybe. For clarification on that; he and my stepmom fight a lot and they broke up twice in their 6 year marriage. I'd be surprised if they stay married long term.\n\nElizabeth still says I'm wrong to wear the bracelet when it bothers hers, especially at home.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1694770204, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16j8kpx/aita_for_wearing_a_friendship_bracelet_that_i/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Frankly, her jealousy is not your problem or your responsibility. It is up to Elizabeth to mitigate those feelings. She is not entitled to the title BFF, especially since you already have one. If I were you, I would suggest to your stepmom that she seek therapy for Elizabeth. You're not actively taunting her or anything, you are simply wearing a piece of jewelry that has a lot of sentimental value to you, but she has no right to make you stop wearing it just because she's jealous. Elizabeth needs to work out her jealousy on her own without trying to force you to make concessions.\n\nAlthough, if I had to guess, I'm sure Elizabeth also agrees that her mother and your father will probably not remain together for a long time, since she must also be aware of them fighting so much. She probably feels closer to you than she does to her own friends, and it's possible that if your parents divorce, any relationship you and Elizabeth had will dissipate. Therefore, she might feel that establishing herself as a BFF will mean that you two will remain friends even if your parents are not together anymore. She may have other reasons for being jealous, but that might explain why the jealousy has gotten worse as time goes on", "NTA. She's probably jealous that you and Summer are so close, and she wants a friendship like that, but that's not your responsibility. From what you've said, she seems lonely, but that doesn't give her the right to try and force you to be her best friend. Wear your bracelet with pride and don't let anyone tell you to take it off", "NTA\n\nShe's allowed to be jealous. That doesn't make it *your* problem to solve. I'm glad your stepmother already spoke to her about it but she and your father need to make it clear to Elizabeth how unfair it is for her to expect you to be her social crutch. And that the harder she pushes the way she is, the less likely you two will ever be able to be close.", "NTA. Really doesnt require much explanation really. You're not required to give people a certain kind of relationship. Sure, as family you should be civil and try to get along, which you appear to, so I think you're doing what's socially asked of you, but you don't have to feign a friendship just to appease others.", "NTA. And I don't think you should feel the need to appease Elizabeth. Her behavior would just make me distance more from her, not be her BFF. And just because you are stepsibling it doesn't mean you have to be so. Hell, that's not even the case for blood related siblings.\n\nLet your stepmom deal with her and just stand your ground. Although, do be careful if you leave the bracelet unattended.", "Nope. NTA. You're allowed your own friends and a relationship with your step sister will either grow closer or not,  but it can't be forced. Stick to your guns and if you're having problems,  talk to your dad.", "NTA, it sounds like a very draining situation for you especially when you're not well", "NTA. Elizabeth is trying to force a closeness that doesn\u2019t exist, and in the process she\u2019s going to end up ruining the generally pleasant relationship you *do* have. I\u2018m glad your parents are being sensible about this.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"My stepmom spoke to Elizabeth after one outburst a few days ago was heard by everyone at home. She told her that I'm allowed to have a best friend and she should focus on her own friendships.\" .. This is GREAT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"My dad checked in on me and tried to figure out if a compromise might be possible where Elizabeth and I have our own thing.\" .. tell him you already share parents, athat is your thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Elizabeth still says I'm wrong to wear the bracelet when it bothers hers, especially at home.\" .. SHe is wrong, you are fine to wear the bracelet. It is GREAT that you have Summer, and Elisabeth's jealousy is for her to manage, not YOUR problem.", "NTA. I'm glad that your parents recognise that Elizabeth's behaviour is unreasonable. Even if you were biological sisters, it's completely normal to not be best friends with your sister. Hell, look at all the weird family dynamics on this sub, it can be normal to not even *like* your siblings. \n\nElizabeth has needs that are clearly not being met. Those needs are not your responsibility. You do not have to go without something you love (your bracelet and your friendship) because Elizabeth thinks she's entitled to your attention. Honestly, she sounds insufferable, and probably wouldn't be your BFF even if you didn't have Summer.\n\nI'm glad you've got such an awesome friend.", "Nta, my sisters and I have the same parents and are all very close in ages, Like 25,26,27 - my mom wanted to change diapers once and be done with it. We are no close, we love each other and are there for each other but we aren\u2019t friends because we\u2019re all very different and that\u2019s okay. She needs to invest in building strong friendship with compatible people instead of expecting them to just plop into her lap. \n\nI do want to commend your dad and stepmom for listening to you and talking to her, especially your dad for self-introspecting and being open to taking accountability. You don\u2019t see that often here. Its also the first I\u2019ve heard on here that a stepmom listen to the stepchild and actually accepted what they were saying and not pushing their own wants onto them. You are very blessed\n\nI wish you and Summer very happy long years of friendship and am so glad that you have such a beautiful friendship.\n\nNta", "Nta you're not responsible for managing her feelings", "NTA.\n\nElizabeth should've left the whole \"you can't be friends with me if you're friends with her\" back in fifth grade.", "Elizabeth is an entitled AH and can get over herself. No wonder she doesn't have any close friends, personality like that. NTA", "Definitely NTA. \n\nYou don't owe anyone closeness and friendship, some people click and other people don't. \n\nNow that being said, if you and Elizabeth get on fine and its clear she is trying to build a relationship with you, there's no harm in finding space for her. \n\nBest friend is a tier, it doesn't have to be reserved for one person.", "NAH\nYou choose your friend and something as deep as the friendship you have with Summer can\u2019t be forced.\nYour stepsister is also no AH cause if she is so lonely is totally understandable she may reach to you.\nNor your dad and stepmother who seems to have dealt with the situation in a mature way. \nHopefully she will find her special person and move on.", "NTA for wearing the bracelet, your stepmom is right she needs to work on her own friendships and jealousy. \n\n\nSaying that could you maybe have another bracelet with her and wear both? A bracelet doesn't takeaway from another one and your friendship. Or perhaps something else symbolic like a badge, not saying you have too but could help.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you\u2019re afraid that stepsister might damage the bracelet, can you keep it safe at a trusted maternal relative?", "NTA and if Elizabeth is this clingy it might explain why she doesn't have many friends. She's not your best friend and there is no need to pretend she is.", "NTA\n\nAt least your stepmom isn't the evil Disney kind.\n\nI think Elizabeth needs something tangible. Not that it's your responsibility, but there is a benefit to you getting some space if she's not spiraling in desperation. Since you don't hate her and you all are a family now (and the shared history remains even if a divorce happens in the future), maybe getting a family picture with matching sweaters (everyone, not just you girls) or something might help her have visual proof that she has/had people to call her own. She's your stepsister and doesn't have competition in that category but I think she needs something to remind herself of it when she's trapped in her thoughts. Maybe watching a show together once a week or doing gentle yoga or cooking or something when you know Summer isn't available (but don't tell Elizabeth that part) can help her make the memories she wants without too much inconvenience on your end (like when doing your nebulizer or deep breathing exercises). You've never felt alone because you had Summer but she doesn't have friends or other siblings, so she may be struggling with the fact that she technically has a sibling she always wanted but feels like she doesn't while you could care less that you have a sibling now. \n\nGood luck and I hope you feel better soon!", "NTA. Elizabeth is naturally concerned with her own feelings. Perhaps the reason she doesn't have her own close friends is that she only thinks of her own feelings. Your feelings are valid, you shouldn't have to hide them or apologize for having a friend.", "Yep, the stepmom is a keeper", "That's something I considered too. She might want us to stay in touch if my dad and her mom divorce. Maybe that would be her way of keeping some stability or just wanting someone who stays no matter what. For me I was always aware that if my dad got divorced it would mean not seeing Elizabeth anymore. To me the relationship wouldn't be something to fight to keep. But I know she doesn't really have anyone she's close to so it would be different.\n\nI can suggest therapy to my stepmom. I think she'd listen to the advice too.", "Yeah, having her go off on me over the bracelet was tiring. I was already kinda struggling to keep up with her grandparents staying, since I don't really know them and only saw them like twice before. Then having her decide it needed to be brought up... ugh. I can't wait to be better again and get back to school.", "We're just not compatible with being best friends. We're very different and don't really have anything in common. I can hang out with her fine but she's not my favorite person to hang out with. I'm not sure I'm hers either. But she seems to want someone she's super close to. I don't see that ever being me. Especially if her mom and my dad do end up divorcing someday soon.", "My dad suggested that but it wouldn't really mean anything to me because Elizabeth isn't my friend or someone I am all that close to. Part of the reason I wear my bracelet so much is it means a lot to me because Summer is my favorite person.", "She already answered this question for her father. She doesn't want to because they're not close.", "Whatever you do, don't take off the bracelet at home to appease her. It'll probably disappear.", "And that's totally fair. \n\nLike I said, best friend is a tier, you don't get there overnight. But since your dad and stepmom are rocky, it's possible that she craves an ally in the house, like you said, she might be seeking closeness. \n\nIf it were me, I would be frank with her that friendship isn't a competition and that there can be space for everyone but you and your best friend have history and you and her are building yours. Tell her to make smaller requests.", "Maybe she is more stressed than usually because of looming divorce? She might be worried about what that means for her every day life. If you are not friends now, will you just suddenly ignore each other if you are not living in same house anymore?", "Maybe you can go out with her and help her meet new people I can get behind the feelings of your stepsister. If you feel like it you can tell her that even though you're not best friends, you're still family and you'll have her back if shit hits the fan and you'll help her find some friends if she's lonely. (Of course if you want to)", "That's really possible. It's something I have thought about and I know I wouldn't try to stay in touch. Not that I'd ignore her but it's unlikely we would hang out or anything. That would be a bigger deal for her than it is for me though and I can see that being stressful for her."]}
