They started the drama.\n\nNTA NTA NTA", "Based on the description given of Jabba the Hutt, I'm sure that's not the only thing he's oozing", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "I feel bad for him tbh. Is he thinking about moving away and becoming independent?", "I would love to be part of a team - an entire line of people who just keep repeating, \"Yes, but how does that mean Logan can't go to Vegas?\" until they get tired and tag out. Next person: \"Yes, but what is the connection between not being able to go and Las Vegas? I'm not sure what the issue is?\"", "Take yourself to Vegas and make sure to send the three of them lots of wonderful pictures with a cardboard cutout of Logan.", "NTA, what's a hooding ceremony?", "NTA, they started with at a family event so anyone upset should be upset with them. Your cousin is going to have a ride awakening when his parents die & when he ends up in the street, his parents will be the only ones to blame.", "What in the world? Its crazy and sad that they somehow think this is helping their son rather than holding him back. What do they hold up as an example of him being special? NTA.", "NTA", "NTA. Sometimes drama is needed and the truth hurts.", "NTA but your brother and wife are! Logan is going to suffer when they pass away and won't be able to function in society.", "NTA\n\n>But others are saying that it was supposed to be a nice family event and even if I don\u2019t mean it, I could have just said sorry instead of causing drama\n\nMike and Chloe started haranguing you at what was supposed to be a nice family event - you simply replied in self defence.\n\nYou should point out to Mike and Chloe that they are doing their son no favours and are have failed in their duties as parents: when they die, Logan is fucked. They should have raised Logan to support himself and care for himself.", "Who will take over from his parents once they are dead?? No woman will want him. NTA", "NTA. They need to make it appear you are the problem because if you\u2019re the problem then Logan isn\u2019t.", "NTA \n\nYou didn't cause the drama; that was your brother and SIL. You finished it.", "Good grief. What makes Logan so special when he can\u2019t cook, clean or financially support himself?\n\n NTA", "But Mike and Chloe are the one that started it. OP finished it. In no way is he TA even a little bit.", "Keep asking why an adult that can\u2019t pay how own bills or keep his own house is \u201cspecial.\u201d", "They will just expect it.", "That image is both nauseating and hilarious", "\u201cHeck, maybe Logan could pay for MY vacation\u2026.\u201d", "No. They've killed his ability to think think himself. He doesn't even leave the room without their permission.", "Yes, good, DisneyWorld\u2026 Disneyland doesn\u2019t want him", "Thank You!", "Your brother and his wife sound awful and they have ruined Logan's life", "All I can think is THANK GOD THE EX FIANC\u00c9 GOT OUT BEFORE ANY MORE DAMAGE HAPPENED!\nNTA. And hope you and the ex can maintain the friendship.", "NTA.  It sounds like it was about time that someone call out the fantasy world that Mike and Chloe have created.  I'm so glad that Alexia realized what a sham of a life that Logan had presented (I'm actually shocked that she had actually agreed to marry him without knowing the truth).\n\nI actually feel sorry for Logan.  His parents are enabling him so much that when they pass away he will be left without any life skills to provide for himself.", "NTA obviously. But I have also never been to Vegas. Op, please Venmo me", "NTA\n\nOp you didn't start drama at the family event, Mike and Chloe did by confronting you in the first place, end of the day had you just said sorry they still would have made a production of it.\n\nOp your family needs to stop placating Mike and Chloe about Logan just because they want the easy route in this and don't want to be the 'bad guy'. They are literally just stabling the boat whilst someone else rocks it, that someone needs to be tossed out so it's smooth sailing.", "For those family members who wanted you to lie and sweep everything under the carpet. Thats what they have been doing for years. This is how Mike & Chloe got this level of entitlement in the first place. If they had shut it down years ago it wouldnt have reached this level and you wouldnt have been put in that situation. NTA", "They should be embarrassed to still treat a grown man as a baby. He is almost 40 \n\nNta", "NTA.  Who is going to take care of this grown ass adult when his parents die?", "NTA \n\n(Though I\u2019d love to hear their side and how they rationalize their actions)", "NTA  Logan needs to grow up.  His parents were supposed to raise him to be a self-sufficient adult and failed to do so.", "NTA. It needed to be said. Could it have been said at a different place and time, sure. But they brought it up at said event. This is on them. I don't know how Logan is going to survive when mommy and daddy aren't around to take care of him. They aren't doing him any favors - at all!", "NTA - I need to hear more tales of Logan the Lout", "NTA.  Mike and Chloe have babied Logan to the point he will never be an adult that can provide for himself.  They have failed as parents and should be ashamed of how logan turned out.", "Are they still changing his diapers too? Sheeeesh. NTA all the way. Actually I think you were quite nice, considering.", "NTA, it was the right thing to say but wrong place to say it. However they needed to hear that, I would just cut them out at this point. I think everyone is just waiting for someone to do it first.", "How do you even screw up making a sandwich? Like, does he put the butter on the outside or something?", "This seems like some kind of abuse", "\"I am sorry, I overheard the conversation and I'm still confused. Please explain to me why Logan is unable to go to Las Vegas?\"", "Sounds like several differences kinds, of abuse. Mental, emotional, financial...", "Yeah, I think you're right. It's really messed up.", "NTA, This might be a bit dramatic. But this sums up a huge problem overall for the human race. We love to just stick our heads in the sand. Sometimes it saves your sanity but in moments like this, someone should of spoken up years ago.", "NTA. Truth hurts. They kept pushing and they found out what you thought. Tough for them.", "[removed]", "Nta", "NTA all they are doing is ensuring when they pass he won't have a clue how to look after himself. No woman is ever going to put up with their demands so they're also ensuring he stays single", "NTA. But I\u2019m very curious: was Logan a \u201cmiracle baby\u201d or did he have any serious illness growing up? (Which would explain the really strange behavior from parents) \n\nOr are your brother and SIL just really bizarre humans?", "NTA. People need to try to pop their fantasy bubble as much as possible. I almost feel bad for Logan. While he is extremely spoiled, it was ofc his parents choices to spoil him to such an extreme. He is incapable of taking care of himself. What happens when theyre no longer able to care for him? He\u2019ll likely be quite old at that point and I can only imagine how difficult it\u2019ll be for him to try to adjust to a life of responsibility. Not saying it\u2019s impossible but it\u2019ll be a lot harder than if his parents taught him hard work and motivation as a kid. Again, I almost feel sorry for him. I don\u2019t actually. I am curious about what his parents would say if you try to walk through the logic of what they expect to happen when they die. Who will take care of their middle aged baby boy? Im guessing theyd expect OP or other family to take over\n\nUnrelated, I never heard of the hooding ceremony before so for the time it took me to google it, I was thinking \u201cOP is friends with someone in the KKK?\u201d", "Usually the mods lock posts like these instantly because people keep spamming \"manchild\".\n\nMust be tough to be a mod right now lol.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

To travel and relax because they'll be too busy working to provide for their stubborn child. Then they'll wonder why they can't enjoy retirement and why no one else in the family will step up and take of they're baby boy.", "Yeah but he actually has to be worthy of marriage and be a catch to land a woman in the first place. Which he's not.", "Oh yeah, they'll definitely expect it and be so upset when they dont. \n\nI'm sorry the rest of your family doesn't want to live with a leech. They're in for a rude awakening when they're considered too old for work and have no money, and no way to afford to take care of themselves and they're kid.", "If got a semi-decent public library nearby, worth seeing if they offer any help or courses. A simple phone might help her avoid the scams - few apps,big buttons, limited internet access.", "Same lol", "I'd be thinking adult protective services. What type of work does he do? He's held down a job for three years so can't be totally rendered incapable. Feel really sorry for him."]}
