Both me and my sister are lucky enough to be SAHMs and we visit once a week. \n\nPast several months I have watched the joy in my sisters eyes slowly die out and anger has replaced it. She has been very short tempered and angry with her children and husband. \n\nThis past week I again noticed the anger and she complained about how she was tired of feeling like a single parent and she has no motivation to do things. This was very out of character for her to say since her husband is very involved in household chores and rearing their children.\n\nI talked to my husband about my concerns and mentioned how she has told me before there have been a couple times she has been so angry and frustrated she has hit a *inanimate object censored by reddit mod*. He then tells me about something mean she said to her husband\n\nI call my mom the next day and ask what I should do or if I was making a crumb into a cupcake. She agreed that something was wrong and suggested we go for a dinner night out and ask her if she is OK. \n\nDinner ends, we all go back to the car and I recount the info above and ask if she is ok\n\nShe got angry and defensive, \"I didn't realize I was such a terrible mom and wife and now I feel like shit.\" She wouldn't look at us as we hurriedly told her that no one is saying that at all. I reminded her that I think she is an amazing mom.\n\nShe remained silent so I offered up advice for when she is feeling frustrated with her kids. I also added that I feel more angry and irritable when me and my husband aren't properly connected. I told her that if your marriage isn't your priority everything else suffers and reminded her I can babysit any time\n\nShe then angrily says none of my ideas will help and she didn't think anything was wrong and it's been a bad week. I remind her I've been noticing something wrong for several months. I added that I wasn't looking for some sob confession and reassured her that if she can honestly say everything is alright I would drop it. \n\nShe repeated that it's been a hard week and she knows she has a temper and is working on it. I told her that's great and then relayed information to her that I had learned in therapy about how to deal with anger and frustration. I made several suggestions on what she can do in those moments but she cut me off saying those won't work and yelled something else that I will keep private\n\nI replied, \"yeah you seem totally fine. Whatever. Thanks mom for dinner sorry it ended badly.\" I then left.\n\nNext morning her husband texted me. He berated and scolded me saying how dare I tell her she was a bad wife and mom and ruin her self esteem and that I had no right confronting her.\n\nThis made my blood boil. I reminded him that I never said any of those things and that I was concerned for my sister. I told him to f*** off and that they were uninvited from Easter dinner.\n\nI hate this but refuse to apologize just to make peace.

Whatever. Thanks mom for dinner sorry it ended badly.\" \n\nYou think a professional counselor EVER says \"whatever\" or \"endly badly\"????\n\nAnd then you uninvited them from Easter dinner <---- that's your ego.\n\nYes, maybe your sister needs help.  Maybe she needs to see a psychologist/therapist to help.  Maybe she is angry or has depression.  But you don't seem to be the right person to be doing it until you get your ego in check.", "YTA.\n\nEven just reading this, you came off condescending. \n\nYour sister is allowed to go through a hard time, she's allowed to react naturally, and cope how she needs to. She may not be doing it how you would, but unless she asked for your opinion or help, I'd let it be. \n\nUnsolicited advice is usually not as helpful as you think it is.", "INFO: was your sister looking to vent or was she looking for change?\n\nYou took a private conversation, and decided to initiate change, which is fine if that\u2019s what she asked for\n\nMore than anything, YTA of then discussed it with literally everyone under the sun, looking for their unsolicited advice as well.", "Nta. You didn't ruin her self esteem,  she's mad you called out her behavior.", "NTA. If your account of events is entirely accurate, that is as considerate and measured a response and approach as a reasonable person could expect or hope for. Your BIL didn't seem to ask any questions, but rather just flew off the handle. What you did doesn't seem a lecture as much as productively putting forward concerns.\n\nThere might be something more complicated going on with her, but that is not your fault. Nor does her having to contort events and conversations make it your fault. I don't have any recommendation to give, but again NTA.", "NTA.\n\nNo, this wasn't any of your business. But your sister has now proven that she gets violent when upset - and you've noticed that she's increasingly getting more and more upset with her husband and kids.\n\nThat is the point at which you absolutely need to intercede, for the children's sake.\n\nAlso, i get the feeling that all the judgements in this post would be very different if it was your brother getting so angry with his wife and kids that he lashes out physically at inanimate objects.", "NTA - She is starting to show violent tendencies, which you have noticed. Maybe it won't lead to abuse, but if she keeps acting like that I can see it down the road. \n\nDid you maybe go about it a bit heavy handed? Sure. But the point is you are concerned. She is only upset because other people have now noticed what she thought was hidden. Granted, not like there is much more you can do at this point, but it helps to just keep an eye on your neices/nephews.", "NTA\n\nIt's good to show concern for your sister, someone you know better than most people. There does seem to be something going on, and something she definitely doesn't want to talk about. Just tell her that you're there for her, and leave it at that. The ball is in her court. Do not say anything else unless solicited.", "Sometimes the best thing with family is to remember not my circus not my monkeys. \n\nShe didn\u2019t come to you for advise, she needed to vent. Her husband did the same when he spoke to yours. \n\nIt hurts but let people self implode. \n\nYTA", "You have no need to apologize for trying to look out for your sister's wellbeing. That's what family DOES. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYou were just sharing your concerns for her, that's what siblings do.", "NTA - It sounds like your sister is struggling with some mental illness. I know that in my own personal experience, when you are feeling flooded with feelings of anger, recounting confrontations always gets skewed out of defensiveness. Sounds like she definitely was feeling defensive when you talked to her in the car. Therefore, not really hearing you and only really absorbing the negative things that she is insecure about. She definitely needs some help, but people don't like to accept it unless they are ready. I'd say give them both some time, maybe try talking with your Mom about it more and make a plan to try and re-invite them to Easter if you can. I think they need you guys more than they know, but your feelings are also valid. I hope everything gets better!", "ESH, your sisters mom rage is a real problem and all of us experience it. It\u2019s shameful and she feels badly about being called out for it, because she KNOWS she\u2019s acting wrong. She may need some meds for PPD. \nYou literally took her out to PUBLIC SPACE to shine a spotlight on her in the guise of \u201cconcern\u201d ( which even in its sincerity came off condescending) \nI hope she gets help for what\u2019s eating her, and I hope you can repair your relationship.", "YTA\n\nThese were a lot of advices and suggestions (based on assumptions) addressed to someone who didn't asked you for advice. \n\nImagine going to a dinner with your sister and mom after a hard week, looking forward for a nice time with ppl you love just to find out they speak about you behind your back and gang up on you even if you assured them you are fine. Then they continue to give you unasked advice despite knowing if there is something wrong, including stuff like like imlying you have marriage issues or are overhelmed by your kids. \n\nAnd for someone who assert to care so much about the sisters wellbeing, you jumped extremly fast to uninviting her for easter and escalating the situation. You must REALLY love and care about her. Smh. Every normal person would have tried to deescalate the situation and try to talk calm and apologize for the misscommunication.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Especially with what is described. If the \"venting\" has been doing that, the time for venting is past. There needs to be an active discussion and help to address the issues before it escalates into something bigger", "Ah! That's some great insight. To be honest I have no idea, whenever she has talked to me about her issues in the past I have done a mixture of both and have never had her angry at me until now. But i have never had to ask her about a problem before and she has never discussed any actual big problems like this with me before. She relatively has a quiet life with not a ton of big problems or she just keeps everything to herself and this is the first time I'm seeing an internalized problem surface", "\"Dinner ends, we all go back to the car and I recount the info above and ask if she is ok\"\n\nThey went in public, they were in the privacy of their car.", "I think OP would need to be a bit clearer as to what \"hitting an inanimate object\" actually means. If its smacking a pillow, that's not an uncommon tactic. Is it helpful? Not in the long term, but it can be a cathartic release in the immediate. If it's punching a TV through the screen, that's a whole other story.\n\nLike I said, I don't think OP is in the wrong for expressing concern and asking what her sister needs in order to feel supported, but I think the approach may have been wrong.", "If that's the case, this is how I would read the situation. \n\nYou and your mom took her out for what she thought was probably a nice little get away from her hubby and kids for a night after having had a hard week. Thinks that she had a lovely time and then you approach her with this issue. There's never a right time to confront someone about your concerns but there can certainly be more appropriate ones. \n\nWith her stating that it's been a shit week where she feels like she might be struggling as a mom and a wife, that was the time to either just say, \"I'm always here if you need to vent or a parenting break\" but unfortunately you may have twisted a knife with the comment about her marriage which didn't help since she was on the defensive already. And then with your comments about her temper it probably just felt like a pile on. \n\nUltimately NTA, but I think this could be a stepping stone to talk to your sister about how she might like support when she is having a bad week or is struggling. Lots of people just like to be heard with a few solutions based comments here and there, they don't want to have their relationships or parenting broken down, especially since you only know so much about what goes on in her household. \n\nI think there are apologies owed on all sides. You don't need to apologize for being concerned but you can apologize for how you approached her.", "I agree with the commenter above. I personally find that there is nothing worse than someone trying to use their therapy insights to give advice. Those types of insights are given by a professional in context, and it comes off as so condescending and also unhelpful to rattle them off as if they're one size fits all.", "Same difference, it\u2019s like taking the kids to the circus and then telling them their parents died right after. And a car isn\u2019t a very private place either"]}
