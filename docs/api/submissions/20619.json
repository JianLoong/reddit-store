It makes me wonder what her/her family is saying behind your back that they don't want you to know.", "Nta also she be talking shit about you in her language. Learn it in secret.", "Wow your gf sounds a little crazy. We have white people in the family and never once accused them of racism for learning some Spanish. Nta. Goodluck learning Spanish!", "It was \u2026 rude of you to start learning Spanish? What if you just wanted to learn Spanish because there are 43 million native Spanish speakers in the United States? It is not racist to make a good faith effort to learn to speak another language. NTA, but maybe this is your girlfriend\u2019s subtle and clumsy way of telling you she doesn\u2019t see this as a potentially serious relationship?", "NTA\n\nThat was a really weird response from your girlfriend. As some other people have suggested her family might be talking shit about you or her relationship with you.\n\nHave you used DuoLingo yet? I have been using it for the past 3 weeks to learn spanish. It has been extremely helpful.", "NTA.  Most people would treat that as a generous, considerate move.  My mom\u2019s family is white (mostly Irish) and some of her siblings have interracial marriages.  As kids we\u2019d often be taught a few phrases (especially things like greetings and please and thank you) if they had family visiting who had limited English while we were there.  So I learned little bits of Tagalog and Spanish starting pretty young (though I\u2019ll admit, I\u2019ve lost all of the Tagalog).  Wanting to be able to communicate a little, and demonstrate interest and friendliness to your SO\u2019s family is a good thing.", "NTA. I'm learning Spanish for a similar reason and my bf is really pleased/flattered", "NTA. I've never heard of anyone wanting to learn the language of others being mocking or demeaning. Quite the opposite, it's a sign of your respect for them, among other positive attributes.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is an idiot. As a latino I commend you for taking the time to learn spanish. It's very different compared to english and trust me, her family will appreciate you making the effort.", " NTA I can\u2019t fathom a reason your gf would want you to be unable to communicate with her family, and get to know them better. I would say it\u2019s actually commendable for you to go out of your way to learn their language. If she\u2019s concerned with \u201csome white boy\u201d learning Spanish, sounds like she shouldn\u2019t date a white person, she\u2019s the racist one.", "NTA, and this is a huge red flag for your relationship.\n\nLearning at least a few sentences in someone else's language is generally considered a compliment. It's a way of conveying these messages: \"I think your language is valuable; I'm not expecting you to make allowances for me by speaking English all the time; I'm really interested in you and your cultural background; I'd like to learn more\".\n\nFor your girlfriend to not see it like this, and think you're making fun of her family, is deeply weird.", "NTA \n\nYour gf should be thrilled to find out that you're learning her mother tongue to be able to communicate with her family and I'm sure they would be happy too even if you weren't fluent. Not a lot of ppl put in that much effort for their partners nowadays.", "NTA you can do better.", "NTA.

My voice is hard to understand sometimes, which is how I learned that people can't help what they sound like. You aren't the A for trying to communicate with her family.", "NTA many people are flattered when you make the effort to learn their language. Was in an airport in Jordan picking up my lost luggage and just saying thank you in Arabic made them light up. It made me wish I knew more. Keep at it, even if you don\u2019t stay with her. You will only be richer for the knowledge. This is something I wish I realized at a younger age, almost 40 and barely trying to learn Spanish and I am Hispanic.", "lol. how is this being racist. u want to communicate with family. its actually very thoughtful of u. also, im pretty sure you dont have to be a specific skin colour (edit-non-white in this case) to learn a foreign language.\n\nNTA.", "Info: why she is assuming this has anything to do with her?

This is really odd imo. Two of my ex partners spoke English as a second language, and they and their families were delighted when I started learning their languages instead of just expecting them to learn English. Very odd behaviour here, but I wonder if this is something that may be a sore spot for your gf due to previous experiences", "Nta, I would honestly leave her.

Plus you should look for some slang words. You never know.", "NTA all the way. She's being ridiculous, there nothing racist in wanting to learn her language/speak to her family in her language", "op the fact that you had the initiative to go learn a foreign language for your so is already something amazing, most if not all sane people would be so happy if their so did something like this. you shoud find another girlfriend who will appreciate the effort you want to put into a relationship. NTA. op please reflect of these comments. you can find better girls out there", "NTA, what is wrong with your girlfriend? I would think that\u2019s so sweet if my SO tried to learn my family\u2019s language to communicate with them! I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s racist at all.", "NTA, take this as a red flag that there is something wrong with this relationship.  For her to use the term \"White Boy\" says a lot as well.  Skip the party and leave her.", "NTA.\n\nThere are lots of hispanic kids who dont even bother speaking Spanish. Their families would love for them to even try to start learning. You're learning out of love for your girlfriend and to be respectful and inclusive to her family. You're demonstrating that you want to get close to her culture and family,  and that makes her mad? \n\nI would start with introductory phrases that show that you want to learn and want to practice Spanish. \"I am learning spanish\", \"can you help me pronounce ___\", \"does that make sense/ did I say that right?\", \"spanish is a little difficult to learn, but im trying\". As well as conversational phrases, \"what is this dish called?\", \"the food is super good!\", \"this is my first time trying this/eating this\", \"im not used to rating this type of food\", \"I'm full already, but thank you!\", \"what is your name?\", \"how are you related to <gf's name>/ how do you know her?\", \"i want to get to know <gf's name>'s family\" . Or if you finish your food and those around you are still eating, you can say \"provecho\". (It means benifit/advantage, but its also a one-word phrase used after a meal is finished. You can add \"buen\" to the beginning too. Its like \"the food was good, continue to enjoy your meal\". If someone tells you provecho you can respond with the same phrase if you are also done eating. If youre still eating you can say thank you).These would help you get a conversation going and flowing while you're still a beginner, and they also will show that you are actively learning and have an interest in the family. \n\nI'm not sure why she thinks you're mocking. The only way I'd see someone as mocking a language is if they purposely butcher the pronounciation while making faces and talking in a sarcastic way like they're a stand up comic at the bar or something. Spanish and English have very different ways of pronouncing letters and sounds. That's why Spanish speakers also have a tough time learning English. Since you're still learning, your accent may not be 100% accurate, but it doesn't mean you're mocking. Same goes for any other language. \n \n\nThe adults in my family speak Spanish only, but some of them have working-proficiency in English (they know enough English to communicate at work). I've had a couple friends over just on random days and sometimes my family would randomly decide ro have a parillada/carne asada (basically a \"barbecue\") and the whole family would come over. Most of my friends are also Mexican, but i have a few who are mixed or who just dont speak spanish. My friends (the ones who didn't speak Spanish but learned a few phrases) would go and say hello to the family.  Even just saying \"hola\" or \"como est\u00e1n todos?\" would be impressive and considered polite. \n\nI think her family would react the same. They'll see it as a very polite gesture.", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA. your GF is a brainwashed idiot SJW and she is the actual racist.", "Here\u2019s a little tidbit. English is one of the hardest languages in the world to learn, if you\u2019re not a native speaker. Spanish is by comparison much easier to learn.\n\nThe reason I say this is because you are doing native Spanish-speakers a service by communicating with them in Spanish. It helps greatly, and I\u2019m very confused by your GF\u2019s anger at this.\n\nETA: NTA", "YTA, not really, but...\nI hear your kind gesture to reach out to her family. I see your effort to mark this relationship as important and invest in it. You actions have all the intention of kindness.\n\nBUT if you cook a dinner for someone as a surprise, and they come home and have already eaten, it's abusive to force them to eat because you put effort and kindness into it.\n\nYou did not ask or alert your gf of your intention. (You don't need an intention to better yourself and learn a language, but you do need to say something if this involves another human being). White folk have a long history of ruining other culture's lives and you display no sensitivity to generational trauma. I won't guess as to why this has made your gf upset, but you need to ask, and then shut up and listen. This is not about you, this is about her. What were her hopes in bringing you to meet her family? Is this connected to the stress of bf meeting parents? What does you learning Spanish mean to her? \nI know folks who are gracious and welcoming when a United Statesian speaks another language, and i know more folks who find it upsetting and would rather speak in English.\n\nIf you want to continue to date this person, please give them space to explain, and don't expect yourself to understand. Ask for clear ways to support her when\\if you meet her family. Ask for understanding\\forgiveness for yourself, as you don't know her culture and will undoubtedly stomp around like a drunk gorilla when trying to navigate this.\n\nStop wondering if you are an asshole, accept that folk who look like you (but aren't you) have raped and subjugated folk in Latin cultures, and start asking how you can be supportive instead of assuming you are.", "On the one hand, telling a person of color or an ethnic minority that what they experience as racist isn't racist feels...well...kinda racist.\n\nOTOH, telling your BF who is trying to learn Spanish so he can communicate with your extended family (which seems considerate and respectful) that he sounds like a white boy who's mocking them -- presumably because he's not great at speaking Spanish -- and hence he's racist seems to miss the mark.\n\nOP, I don't think you did anything wrong.  It doesn't sound like you were coming from a place of racism, but rather a place of wanting to connect with your GF's family and advance the relationship.  \n\nSo from my perspective, there's a problem here that might make you want to reevaluate this relationship in terms of your future happiness.  \n\nAnd from my perspective, NTA\n\nIf I'm missing the boat here and don't actually understand what's going on, I very much hope that someone who's been on the receiving end in this kind of situation with enlighten me.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm from Spain. Her arguments are nonsense.\n\n NTA, but I would worry about what this kind of reaction says about her. Either she doesn't think the relationship is half as serious as you, or she expected her and her family to be able to talk shit about you without you knowing.", "NTA\nI'm South American and my partner is British and I always like when he's trying to learn my mother tongue, but he finds it very hard to learn.\nI don't understand her reaction, it's odd.", "nta, i'm a mexican guy and if i had a partner who would be willing to learn my language i would be happy. it's not racist to learn a language. \n\n>that I sound like a white boy mocking them.\n\nthis part doesn't make any sense because if you put in effort and learn the proper pronunciations of accents and shit, you'd sound like a spanish speaker. my mom's bf is a white guy and his spanish is better than mine sometimes lmao. he sounds like a native spanish speaker for the most part so it's possible for you too.", "Good on you for learning. Maybe your next Spanish speaking girlfriend will appreciate the effort.", "She may be freaking out, thinking that you are treating the relationship as more serious than it is.\n\nLearning the language of your girlfriend's family, otherwise, is a cool move.", "NTA. Sounds like your GF is very racist. White boy? Really. Absolutely would make me think/assume that her family were mocking you behind your back. It seems extremely suspicious, why would your GF not be happy about you embracing her language/culture. God forbid ye have children together and you want to understand potentially what they are saying.", "Nta and watch out with this girl. It\u2019s a very strange reaction and I can\u2019t think of a reason why she\u2019d be upset except for \n1. She\u2019s actually planning to end the relationship or\n2. She doesn\u2019t herself know any Spanish and she\u2019s worried you\u2019ll make her look bad", "NTA. As a person that learnt multiple languages at some point or another (for example, we had 5 languages total in high school (one mother tongue, one dead and 3 foreign), I don\u2019t get gatekeeping languages. Especially when English speakers try to learn another - it should be encouraged. There is a saying in my language that a person is worth as many people as languages they speak.", "NTA", "NTA. Her family probably doesn\u2019t like you. Something is being said behind your back and she doesn\u2019t want you to know about it. \n\nLatin families absolutely love when significant others take the time to learn Spanish. I have never had a family member get mad at an s/o learning Spanish, I\u2019m fact we encourage it and it makes us happy. \n\nMy husband is one of the favored in laws because he not only learned Spanish so he could talk to May dad and grandma who know zero English but he is also the only in law that asks for blessings when entering any of my relatives house.", "Unless you're leaving out a boatload of context NTA. Learning a language takes time and getting the accent right is part of that.", "Dump the girlfriend - learn the language anyway. \n\nNTA", "You\u2019re Nta coming from a Hispanic with a white boyfriend learning Spanish. I would be very happy with your effort. Honestly this sounds like baggage she has, and it may not be worth it. There\u2019s plenty of women/people out there that would appreciate your kind effort.", "NTA. And why would you be mocking the family?", "That's really weird. I learned Spanish after high school working alongside Hispanic people a lot, and they're always appreciative of my effort to communicate,   as I am theirs. It's win/win. NTA", "It sounds shady AF. Why wouldn't she want you to communicate with her family on a personal level? My family is latinoamerican, my BIL is British, we love it when he tries to speak and learn Spanish.", "NTA. But she is hiding shit if she doesn\u2019t want you to learn the language", "NTA \n\nI learned Spanish as a second language to near fluency. Never once have I ever encountered someone who was displeased that I learned their language. The reactions I get are from ambivalence to thankfulness to pure excitement", "NTA.\n\nAnd this is a huge red flag. Run.", "NTA. Based on your post, you sincerely wanted to learn the language because to be able to talk to her family. She should be proud of ypu making an effort to learn Spanish. Also, it's great to learn a new skill which can be useful in the future (part from your initial intention). I don't understand why some people finds it racist if a Caucasian American learns another language.", "They\u2019re talking about you behind your back\n\nI\u2019d dump her", "A friend of mine is french, his gf of 3 months is on a pretty big streak on Duolingo and he really appreciates it", "NTA, I wonder what's her exact problem with it. When my partner showing interests in learning my language I took it as a very very green flag, so I'm really curious as to why she took offense to it.", "Uhm, dunno. Maybe just break up with her. She sounds like she has a few screws loose.", "NTA. I disagree with the consensus that your gf and her family are talking shit, but maybe she could have some weird ideas from her family on English speaking people \"appropriating\" language? It's clear you were trying to appreciate her language and embrace her family to communicate to most people with brains. Former Texan, it's so important to know how to communicate in a diverse community. I hope you keep practicing! Even if it's just for you, you never know when a couple phrases may come in handy. And it's a beautiful language.", "This is what I was wondering too. What is the family talking about that she does not want her boyfriend understanding?", "Gate keeping for a reason.\n\nNTA", "That's a bingo", "\u201cYou\u2019re right, I\u2019ll stop learning\u201d. Become proficient, learn her truth. Which I personally do love, honestly. \n\nOr just keep asking her why she has such an issue with you wanting to communicate with her family, and with not expecting them to learn your language which you think would be the racist, privileged, white boy thing to do? NTA - she\u2019s being weird.", "I came to type the same thing.   You would think they would be happy you were trying to learn.  Nta.", "Yup, drop roll and run away to fuck OP", "Yeah probably because it\u2019s idiotic.\n\nSpanish is a white language from Europe! \nNothing racist about it!", "Not just the United States.\n\nThe Spanish language originated in Spain, which is a white European country!", "Some people decry everything as racist. Insist on her family speaking English -> racist, learn their language -> racist, ignore them -> racist (=considering them at lower level), talk to them -> racist (=putting pressure)\n\nMinorities have AHs as well.", "Which would be the normal reaction. OPs gf has issues. NTA", "Maybe your SO and his family actually likes and respects you, unlike poor OP here.", ">NTA I can\u2019t fathom a reason your gf would want you to be unable to communicate with her family\n\nBecause she wants to talk about him behind his back.", "If she\u2019s concerned about a white boy learning Spanish then she had better have a word with the entire country of Spain.", "Spanish is a European language lol. It's basically street Latin.", "There's a line and 'learning my language is racist' is a pretty safe place to put the line for just replying. No. It's not.", "Honestly sounds like theyre both too young to be playing that game", "yeah", ">On the one hand, telling a person of color or an ethnic minority that what they experience as racist isn't racist feels...well...kinda racist.\n\nno, its not when the person of colour is wrongly accusing someone of racism.", "Wydm?\n\nPlaying which game specifically?", "Gate keeping the language so they can talk shit. Maybe im assuming too much but OP sounds like highschool relationship to me.", "Got it.\n\nThey aren't gate keeping the language though. Her family is. Along with her.\n\nIn any case it sounds like an uncomfortable situation for the guy.", "Her reaction tells me she is just as gatekeeping as they are.", "Wait, where does it imply the family is gatekeeping the language? It sounds like only the gf is doing so.", "I agree with you. And the gatekeeping is a major red flag for the relationship.\n\nThe behavior is also extremely common in Hispanic / Latino culture.\n\nI grew up in California. A bunch of my friends were from Mexico and central America.\n\nThese days I shoot pool in a bar with a bunch of Hispanic (mostly Mexican) guys.\n\nMy Spanish is good enough that I speak it about half the time and understand about 80% of what people are saying.\n\nI've noticed lately when I meet new guys in the group, my friends will say something like, \"Guero habla.\" (the white guy speaks Spanish.) Just as a heads up to them because casual shit talking is so common.", "You are correct that it does not. I went back and reread it.\n\nShe seems to be speaking on behalf of her family."]}
