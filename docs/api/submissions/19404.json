It's ridiculous to think her boyfriend has to get your boyfriend's approval to move in.  If you don't like it, get your own place.", "NTA for not wanting a man who your mother has known for two weeks to move in,\n\nYour mother is engaging in high risk behavior and what kind of dead beat man needs to move into a girlfriend's home after only two weeks. \n\nIt indicates the the person is almost certainly unstable financially and is looking for a new home because almost anyone who is financially stable would have an apartment or home and couldn't just move in that abruptly.\n\nNot that poverty is a crime but I would be very suspicious of a 52 year old man who didn't seem able to support themselves.\n\nEven without a child involved, your mother is asking for trouble. Once he is in the home, hard to remove and given that your mother is willing to move him in at all - seems as though she has issues and would likely be more than likely willing to put up with abuse whether it is financial, emotional or even physical. \n\nNo shade but your family seems to engage in acting a bit recklessly - if you have a 2 year old kid, you were pregnant at 17. Raising kids is hard - raising a kid at such a young age with what is probably a not great income is even harder. I hope that you try to break the cycle with your child in terms of encouraging her not to engage in sex at any age without contraception unless she is an adult - at least in her 20's and actively wanting a child with a partner who is also committed.", "NTA\n\nYou're an adult with a child.  You have a right to choose where you live, and it's very natural that safety would be one of your primary concerns when it comes to choosing where you live.  You do not wish to live with someone who is essentially a stranger to everyone in the household.  That's very reasonable.  I wouldn't feel safe in that arrangement either.  \n\nYou brought your valid concerns to your mom.  She told you she was going to do whatever she wants.  She can make that choice if she wants to as she is the homeowner.  You can make the choice to move out if her choice to move him in makes you feel unsafe.  \n\nSorry you were put in this position.  But yes, I would absolutely move out if she insists on moving him in.  You don't want to risk your daughter being in a home with someone no one knows, especially someone who immediately wants to move in with their new partner.  There's usually a *reason* they are in such a rush to move in, and it's almost never good.", "NTA\n\nThis is about your mother's safety as much as anything, and as someone only a little older than her, I'm really worried for her. Besides the fact that she's essentially letting a stranger move into her home, the fact that she CRIED when you tried to speak to her rationally about her making a really dangerous, wildly irresponsible choice indicates that she is doing this out of panic and desperation . . . the worst possible reasons. \n\nShe barely knows this man. After a few weeks, all she knows is whatever \"best version of himself\" he has been choosing to show her in these early days of dating - which to be fair, could really be representative of him, but could also be a complete lie, and she hasn't known him long enough to figure that out - and the dopamine hits of new infatuation that her brain is basically high on. It's a dangerous choice at the best of times.\n\nBut her being unable to have a calm, reasonable discussion about this and lay out her reasoning to you in a mature, thought-out fashion indicates that this is just as rushed and crazy as you think it is. Her bursting into tears makes me think that she's afraid he'll leave her if she doesn't move as quickly as he wants . . .or that she just wants a partner so badly that she's willing to do anything. Either way, she's behaving very impulsively and with WAY too little actual thought.\n\nWhen you add to that the fact that she is bringing this man she barely knows into a home she shares with her young adult daughter and a TODDLER? Yeah, absolutely not. If she wants to endanger herself that's bad enough. But she doesn't get to put you and your child at risk when you share a home. And contrary to what others will say here, it doesn't matter if you pay rent or not. This isn't a legal sub, it's \"Am I The Asshole\" . . . and putting y'all at risk over this terrible decision makes her an AH.", "*Together 2 or 3 weeks, and she's moving him in???*  That's cray cray.

So presumably you do have some option that doesn't involve living with your mother. I suggest you exercise that option, right now, whether she moves him in or not.\n\nThe reason: even if she doesn't move this person in - hell, even if she breaks up with him! - I don't think you can trust your mother to care about your daughter's wellbeing. If you stay living with her, she'll try something similar further down the track. Get out now.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, you are your child's advocate and regardless of whether or not you pay bills a child's wellbeing and safety is more important than feelings, etc.\n\nIf your mom wants him to move in that's her decision but the fact she's negatively reacting to you simply wanting to get to know him more is strange and a red flag.  You wouldn't move in with someone you barely know in any other situation so this shouldn't be any different.  Your mom is being careless towards your child's safety.  I'd consider doing a background check since he'll likely be around her at some point.", "NTA, it's perfectly reasonable to not want your kid around a stranger.
