We have a combined family of my son (17) and her son (12), both from our previous marriages. We split custody with the other parents 50/50.\n\n   \nI love my stepson. He is a good kid, we get along well. As he gets older I feel like my wife continues to be protective and baby him. This includes waiting on him hand and foot, which is another issue. When he is home with us, every night she puts him to bed, he asks her to stay, and she will lie down next to him in his bed and they will both fall asleep. She usually wakes up in the middle of the night at some point and will come to bed in our bedroom. When her son is here, I go to bed alone. I feel that at 12 this is inappropriate for a number of reasons. I feel he is getting too old to need 'his mommy' in this manner. I want to see him learn and be comfortable with some independence and being able to self soothe  if he is anxious. And I want my wife to go to sleep next to me, I miss her, and I want her to want to be in bed with me too. I am ok with her helping him get to sleep some times, but this is every single night. \n\n  \nShe doesn't agree. Her feelings are she'll never get this time back, he still young enough that he wants his mom around, and eventually won't want this as he gets older (which I'm starting to doubt). He also does not get this type of comforting and nurturing at is father's house, so she feels obligated to make up for that. Not to mention with split custody she gets half the time she normally would if he were with her full time. These are all legit reasons but I feel like enough is enough and there are a lot of reasons this practice needs to discontinue. For all of our sake's.

I don't even know how to address this...\n\nThere's technically nothing wrong with her sleeping with her son at his age. It's like a cultural taboo for us for no reason.\n\nThat said, he should not *need* her in order to sleep at this point. The point of parenting is to raise a functioning adult. There needs to be a transition period and it should probably be around puberty...which is soon or now.\n\nForgot the verdict. NAH", "I live in Japan, and many families sleep with their kids until the child wants to sleep separately, which may happen anywhere between 8 and puberty.

Some 12 year olds are ready to shave and others are more like 8-10 year olds. He will eventually kick her out and want his own space.\n\nSince there is shared custody your wife is only away from you half the time so not a big lose of your wife in bed. Your resentment is unnecessary. Give it time. Your wife may feel guilty over the divorce and is trying to make it up.\n\nI know of no teenage boys who want their mom in their bed so this will resolve.", "NAH. He will eventually want to sleep alone and you will get the time you want with your wife. Let her snuggle him to sleep a little longer. She may resent you if you push too hard on this.", "NTA, but this is a problem that will solve itself in a short time. When my kids were young I would lie down and read stories with them most nights. It was great parenting time. I did sometimes fall asleep with one or the other and make my way to my own bed later on. Both my son and daughter decided to say good night in the living areas and go read by themselves around age 12/13. I just wouldn\u2019t sweat it.", "I\u2019m on your side but I also see your wife\u2019s pov on this time not coming back. So I\u2019m hesitating between NTA and NAH.", "Nobody is the AH here. Kids develop at different paces and that bonding time is important to lay down a lifetime of safety and security in their relationship. Divorces, no matter how amicable, are tough on kids. Let them have this time together. And make your weeks off without stepson a special time with your wife. \n\nAll that said, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to have a conversation around \u201cwaiting on him hand and foot\u201d. At that age, building some independence and responsibility is a legitimate concern. It doesn\u2019t have to come at bedtime, necessarily. But with basic chores around the house, teaching and expecting him to take care of his fair share of dishes, learning how to do his own laundry, or taking out trash. There is a way to balance all this.", "NAH\n\nMaybe he\u2019s struggling with split custody and really misses his mom?", "I see both sides. But I do agree with your wife. He'll only be little for a short time longer. In a year or two he probably won't want to snuggle with mommy anymore. She only sees him half the time. It's hard on both of them I'm sure. And kids bond differently with different parents. At dad's house he may not get much attention.", "Info. Has the son had therapy to address his feelings from the divorce?", "My almost 17 year old likes to sleep with me, occasionally. She likes when I fluff the blanket over her head and tuck her in. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. They\u2019re only kids for a little while and if snuggling with mom helps him feel safe and secure when, clearly he\u2019s struggling, why take that from him?

I\u2019m leaning towards NTA, but you need to talk with your wife about this and maybe see a family psychiatrist.", "I agree that she needs to be having him get to sleep on his own. Tucking him in and talking at bedtime is lovely, but she should be able to walk away and have him fall asleep on his own. \n\nI find it kind of ick the way you\u2019re saying she needs to stop attending to his needs so that she can attend to yours, though. She\u2019s got needy males all over the place.", "YTA. And the thing that makes me say that is the way you describe your own needs when this happens. You\u2019re an adult. And half the time, her child isn\u2019t there. The way you talk about it sounds as if the child is there every single night and you haven\u2019t slept next to your wife in weeks. \n\nWaiting on her 12yo, whether it\u2019s a boy or girl, is not appropriate and that will likely cause some personality/behavioral problems in the future. Him asking for cuddles? No. I will cuddle, tuck my kids in, let them come into our rooms for as long as they\u2019d like. Why? Because I know it won\u2019t last forever. One day, they\u2019ll think I\u2019m super lame and want to spend almost no extra time with me. One day, they\u2019ll be out on their own and I\u2019ll only see them from time to time. And I\u2019ll be damned if someone tells me that cuddling and falling asleep next to my child, even at 12, is damaging. A 12 year old is a child. Even if he\u2019s 13, he\u2019s a child. Even at 14. Although by that time he\u2019ll probably reach that point of teenage aloofness and not want her extra cuddles.\n\nBut yeah, if she still cutting his food, maybe tell her he needs to start doing that himself.\n\nAnd you? Don\u2019t be so needy. You can sleep solo for a few hours every other week at night. I\u2019d like to see some independence and be able to self-soothe if you\u2019re feeling anxious in those moments.", "YTA\n\nYou are 52 and you want a cuddle. Who, other than mom, is going to cuddle a 12 year old boy?\n\nHe's a good kid, no complaints right? Do you think her affectionate parenting style may have had something to do with that? Cuddling a 12 year old is not a big deal. He's been through trauma. Divorce is hard. His dad isn't affectionate. Let the kid feel safe in mama's arms for a while longer. He really won't be into it soon enough.\n\nIf you have kids together, then you get to decide together how to parent.

And she still ends up in bed with you. \n\nIf he was 14 or 15, I might address you as NTA \n\nShe won't get this time back, and the moments he will want to cuddle with mom will be fleeting, probably in times of great heartbreak for the years to come. \n\nLet her enjoy the happy cuddles & let him enjoy his mom without the pressures, This world is going to drop on his shoulders in a few years. \n\nI didn't sleep with my mother this way, I probably did with my grandmother until I was about 10.

Your wife is damaging him emotionally out of her own selfishness and guilt over time lost. I am assuming he can go to sleep on his own when at his father's so WHY is he insisting on her being there? All the answers I can think of indicate he probably should get counseling - abandonment issues, intentionally keeping her from your bed,...\n\nAs for her waiting on him hand and foot, he is going to be the AH in many AITA posts 10 years down the line because his mommy didn't allow him to learn how to be an independent, well-adjusted person.", "NTA\n\n12 years old is too old to need mommy to fall asleep.

This is borderline molestation.  Put your foot down, for his sake.", "NTA.  FFS, he's 12, not 2.  Mom is also setting a bad example for the kid's future relationships.  Example. At 25, his girlfriend gets prego, so he decides to marry her.  When she refuses to sleep with kiddo every night (like hubby expects her to) that causes drama in the marriage.\n\nThere's also the other problem.  How long a marriage lasts is directly proportional to how often hubby and wife go to bed (in the same bed) at the exact same time.  Example.  Wifey goes to sleep at 9 every night but hubby stays up till midnight or later playing video games.  Marriage fails soon.", "I think something important here is figuring out why your step son still feels this type of comfort is very necessary. So necessary that it happens every single night without fail. I had a pretty awesome relationship with my mother, and even at 26 I regularly come back and sleep in our house. However, there\u2019s rarely at point past maybe 10 years old that I didn\u2019t want to sleep alone. Independence is a big thing for every child so why is it that your step son tends to avoid his independence? I now work with kids, and while they are amazing, they develop dependencies to certain things really easily and very severely. Such as ipads and eating too much sugar. While these things are perfectly fine in moderation, if they are overdone you can see negative ripples throughout their lifestyle and life skills. I think having a conversation with your wife about how this constant and nonstop behavior sets your step son up for becoming a very adolescent preteen, and eventually a teenager. Being independent as a young boy is important to learn about personal boundaries, communication skills, and social development. While sleeping with his mom at age 12 might not necessarily affect some of these things, it\u2019s certainly hard to guess what it could affect about his development in the future. In my opinion, I think 16-18 is the age where boundaries must be drawn as your son will soon become sexually active after that age which makes sleeping with his mother extremely strange. At this point, I completely agree that you have every right to be upset as this is your partner whom you expect to spend personal and intimate alone time with. Part of that is definitely sleeping together and waking up together. I think talking to your wife directly about the fact that you do miss her and want to spend quality time like that with her will go a long way. As a woman, if I was told I was missing out on being loved by and loving the man I married, I would be upset with myself and right my actions asap. If she doesn\u2019t do that, maybe give her some time to figure out the things she is prioritizing. Sometimes we have to keep doing something over and over to realize it might not actually be working.

What is your SS's perspective on this?\n\nI'm a single mum with two teens (15F and 13M Dad has not been in their life for many years) and sometimes life can be busy with everyone having different responsibilities (work, clubs, chores, homework, extended family obligations etc) and during times when we are extra busy and one on one time is limited, both of my kids will crawl into bed with me (together and separately) for cuddles. \n\nWhen life returns to \"our normal\" and we have our other one on one time (my 15yo and I read/talk books, my 13yo and I play lego, watch whatever TV series he is into) doing the things they choose as our thing, they rarely crawl into my bed for cuddles. \n\nOn a side note, my mum passed when I was 31 (she was 49). Every Thursday (my day off work) I would go to my mum's after dropping my kids to school, and more often than not she would still be in bed (mum had some mental health issues, and when she was working, worked nights/afternoon shift). I would crawl into bed and have cuddles with mum, and we would talk. This is one of the things I miss most about mum no longer being with us. \n\nI don't think there's an age where cuddling your parent in bed is inappropriate (unless there are inappropriate things happening and that's a completely different story), and if this helps a kid feel safe and be more secure, it's an easy thing to do.", "NAH. My wife shares a bed with my six year old son, and before that with my now nine year old daughter. She's more than happy to sleep with them until they want their own space.\n\nFor her, a big part of it stems from a story about the sister of my childhood friend. She had three kids, and her youngest (3 yo I believe) died overnight from SIDS or SUDC. That cemented in her mind to never pass up on those opportunities until they tell her to get out.\n\nFor me, most nights I do enjoy having the California King all to myself.

There are MANY cultures where families share rooms and/or beds and there is nothing inhibiting about it. I think people's minds go to \"inappropriate\" for both the unspoken incesty assumptions, and for implications about how this might affect the child (key word - child) as an independent adult.\n\nI was a single mom and had an open-door policy for my kids (boy and girl). They were welcome to come in and sleep with me if they were feeling lonely, scared, just needed to feel safe, for some comfort, etc. We are very close and they are adults now, and independent, well-functioning people. I think my son stopped probably around 10 or 11. I try to hold judgement in scenarios like the OP's dealing with because of my own experience. \n\nI would say that IF the child does feel he needs his mom to fall asleep, there is probably something going on that could be addressed in therapy -- it wouldn't hurt. **OP I would tread lightly** (especially using the word \"inappropriate\"--which seems judgmental or apathetic) but maybe gently bring up exploring if the kiddo could benefit from some specialized talk-therapy. I also agree that this will likely die out on its own in the next year or so. Esp. once he starts puberty. Seems his mom is a comfort to him, so approach with support. No way do I feel like you're TAH here, I wanted to say that too.", "Love the NAH here. I totally agree that wife is not an asshole for wanting to snuggle her son, and OP is not an asshole for wanting more marital time.\n\nI don't snuggle my 11-year-old son to sleep anymore, except when he's sick. I do snuggle my 5-year-old but I'm going to try to get her to go to sleep by herself soon. Still, today I had some spare time in the evening (I usually work at night) and I asked my son what he wanted to do, and he said he wanted to sing Christmas carols. So we did.

It must break both of their hearts to be separated every week.", "Clearly, he doesn't \"need\" it. \n\nHe spends the other half of his time sleeping at his father's. \n\nDon't think that's the issue here. \nHe's also 12,  and where do adults check the box that they're no longer tucked in by their mother? \n\nObviously, OP is complaining more because he wants that treatment, not because he thinks an incompetent adult is being raised by her, 6 years before there's even the semblance of a legal interpretation for that.", "I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a cultural taboo as such.  I think one could make some pretty good arguments for why this is not a healthy approach to rearing an adolescent.  The logical side of my brain says this simply does not help him grow into an independent adult, and it\u2019s not particularly healthy for mom either.", "I slept in my parents bedroom until I was 11 or 12. My dad was the one who made a space for me, my mom would kick me out. He even put a mattress under their mattress, so in the middle of the night I\u2019d just go over and pull out the mattress. Lol. I\u2019m laughing now but damn I appreciated it. I\u2019m 49 now, I\u2019m a parent to a great kid who I have an amazing relationship with, and fully functioning. That action taught me that no matter what age I was, my dad had my back. I was lucky that my dad always gave me a hug and a kiss, 82 and 49 and he wouldn\u2019t ever stop expressing his love for my sister and I, and his grandkids. \n\nMy son wanted someone to sleep with him til he was around 10. Here\u2019s the thing. My son was a cuddler, for me those were the best moments. He loved laying with you, with at least his foot making contact with whoever was beside him. \n\nHe\u2019s 15 now. We take the subway together in the morning, my friends tell me it\u2019s rare that a 15 year old gives his dad a hug and says he loves me too when getting off the train. I\u2019m the only parent that his friends come and sit and chat with, according to him. \n\nI can\u2019t say that the same will happen for your step son, but I can say that every child is different. Forget gender roles and norms, your wife is creating a bond with her son that is different from what you\u2019re used to. What makes yours right and hers wrong? \n\nAlso, my partner hated it too. So I listened and tried letting my son sleep on his own. My partner learned the hard way, when it was 2am and my sons awake saying dad while hovering over us. Ya, that\u2019s a great way to wake up in the middle of the night. Lmao. She\u2019ll be back in bed with you before you know it.", "That's fair, I empathize with her pov and a few years ago I totally understood and had no issue in particular but I'm concerned about his growth and being overly dependant on her. Thanks for your response!", "As a child of divorce, with daddy issues going back to 1978, I had major mistrust issues with my stepdad when I was young.

What\u2019s going on at Dad\u2019s that he needs this much comfort from Mom?", "I agree. If he is requiring this much attention from his mom - what is going on at his dad\u2019s? This child needs more than mom snuggles. He needs therapy.", "She does have custody. They split 50/50.", "> Tucking him in and talking at bedtime is lovely\n\nYes, it is. When a kid is 2 - 8 yrs old. Past that point it's going to cause a lot of issues. And sleeping with him nightly? That's way beyond wrong.", "It's kinda his business when his wife doesn't sleep in the bed with him.", "Yeah, no, minding your own business does not apply to situations like this.", "Why not tuck in a 12 year old?

Some couples very successfully sleep in totally different rooms for many reason. Also him bed sharing with his mom for too long has literally no bearing on how he raises his future children.

My son would ask to sleep in my bed when his dad worked out of town. We would just hang out in the room, watch tv, play games and fall asleep. My husband didn\u2019t like it very much and said so he when he was 11 or 12. Somehow the switch flipped within that year and now my son doesn\u2019t even give me hugs anymore unless I hug him. We have a good relationship but he\u2019s just not affectionate like he used to be. I wish my husband wouldn\u2019t have said anything and just gave me that extra time to enjoy him because once they became teenagers they change.", "Yep. The switch will flip with him pretty soon.", "...... yes..... he'll sneak his phone out at bedtime to \"watch tik toks or play games\".....\n\nBut like for real around that age I think we were all exposed to... certain things (although I'm such a nerd I was hiding under the blankets reading). And I guess there's better parental controls now. Either way it'd probably solve the problem.", "Do you know if your step son requests this of his bio dad too?\n\nI'm wondering if he feels insecure (maybe having to bounce from house to house) and just wants to feel safe and reassured with his mom?", "I'd love for you to entertain your claim to \"pretty good arguments\" that are actually sound psychology and not some freudian cocain fueled fever dream. \n\nThe kid doesn't sleep half the time at his mother's house.

In a lot of cultures, families all sleep in groups together.  This is traditionally a normal thing, and has been found to have many health benefits.\n\nWhat OP is describing is entirely benign, and aside from his own discomfort, does not indicate any negative consequences.  It might actually be quite reparative for a child who is away from his mother half the time.  It is also likely that this will naturally phase out in the next couple of years as the boy hits puberty and the urge to differentiate from his parents kicks in to high gear.\n\nI can understand OP's frustration, but I also think that he is passively weaponizing the cultural taboo of sleeping with children to get his way.", "Don't make me cry about a comment on an AITA. \ud83d\ude2d\n\nOur 3.5 is terrified to \"be alone\" and refuses to sleep in his room alone. We moved his toddler bed into our room and he sleeps there every night. I do think following your kid's lead on what they need for safety is important. Your comment helps me to know that this will a) end some day and b) be time well spent as an investment in his well being and also in our relationship. Thanks for sharing this.", "I thought I threw down a solid comment. But this one really takes the cake. \n\nMy 2.75 & 1.5 year old both sleep with their mother every night. \n\nAnd of course myself when I'm the lucky one. \n\nI don't even want to add more than this. \n\nEven though I don't think I ever had this type of relationship with my bio, everything he taught me showed love. \n\nTo this day, I adore and honestly hate the hug goodbye and love you, I'd probably rather kick it for a few more stops with a dad like you.", "I can't speak to the relationship between your son and your wife, but my son wasn't a good reader in middle school. So every night I'd climb in his bed and read him the day's lesson. I'd quiz him on math, go over history events, read him chapter books, and we'd talk about things. And we'd usually end up falling asleep. I'd wake up and leave in 1-2 hrs.\n\nThe outcome -- he passed his classes. He/I eventually got too busy. He went to college and is a fully functioning adult with a job and apartment. He cooks, cleans, etc. all without mommy. Sleeping with your 12 year old son is not going to do damage. It's not creepy as long as your son doesn't think so.", "It\u2019s not going to cause any issues. Lots of 12 year olds still seek connection at the end of the day.", "Can you please expand on the idea that tucking kids into bed every night last a certain age causes issues? I'm with you on sleeping together every night. \n\nMy youngest stepchildren are 9 and 12, and when they're at our house, they both get tucked into bed. That's when they get their nighttime hugs, and we wish them goodnight. It's simply a bedtime ritual, nothing nefarious about it.

It feels like if OP can understand the why he can navigate this. \n\nMine, only 8, always chooses to open up at bedtime. Maybe it\u2019s a delay tactic, maybe he\u2019s just comfortable and relaxed enough to think (he\u2019s pretty energetic), but for example, this may be valuable time where her son feels connected and talks through his concerns with her. Maybe it\u2019s just seeking a sense of security like you said.
