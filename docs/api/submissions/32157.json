We have a combined family of my son (17) and her son (12), both from our previous marriages. We split custody with the other parents 50/50.\n\n   \nI love my stepson. He is a good kid, we get along well. As he gets older I feel like my wife continues to be protective and baby him. This includes waiting on him hand and foot, which is another issue. When he is home with us, every night she puts him to bed, he asks her to stay, and she will lie down next to him in his bed and they will both fall asleep. She usually wakes up in the middle of the night at some point and will come to bed in our bedroom. When her son is here, I go to bed alone. I feel that at 12 this is inappropriate for a number of reasons. I feel he is getting too old to need 'his mommy' in this manner. I want to see him learn and be comfortable with some independence and being able to self soothe  if he is anxious. And I want my wife to go to sleep next to me, I miss her, and I want her to want to be in bed with me too. I am ok with her helping him get to sleep some times, but this is every single night. \n\n  \nShe doesn't agree. Her feelings are she'll never get this time back, he still young enough that he wants his mom around, and eventually won't want this as he gets older (which I'm starting to doubt). He also does not get this type of comforting and nurturing at is father's house, so she feels obligated to make up for that. Not to mention with split custody she gets half the time she normally would if he were with her full time.

I don't even know how to address this...\n\nThere's technically nothing wrong with her sleeping with her son at his age. It's like a cultural taboo for us for no reason.\n\nThat said, he should not *need* her in order to sleep at this point. The point of parenting is to raise a functioning adult. There needs to be a transition period and it should probably be around puberty...which is soon or now.\n\nForgot the verdict. NAH", "I live in Japan, and many families sleep with their kids until the child wants to sleep separately, which may happen anywhere between 8 and puberty.

Some 12 year olds are ready to shave and others are more like 8-10 year olds. He will eventually kick her out and want his own space.\n\nSince there is shared custody your wife is only away from you half the time so not a big lose of your wife in bed. Your resentment is unnecessary. Give it time. Your wife may feel guilty over the divorce and is trying to make it up.\n\nI know of no teenage boys who want their mom in their bed so this will resolve.", "NAH. He will eventually want to sleep alone and you will get the time you want with your wife. Let her snuggle him to sleep a little longer. She may resent you if you push too hard on this.", "NTA, but this is a problem that will solve itself in a short time. When my kids were young I would lie down and read stories with them most nights. It was great parenting time. I did sometimes fall asleep with one or the other and make my way to my own bed later on. Both my son and daughter decided to say good night in the living areas and go read by themselves around age 12/13. I just wouldn\u2019t sweat it.", "I\u2019m on your side but I also see your wife\u2019s pov on this time not coming back. So I\u2019m hesitating between NTA and NAH.", "Nobody is the AH here. Kids develop at different paces and that bonding time is important to lay down a lifetime of safety and security in their relationship. Divorces, no matter how amicable, are tough on kids. Let them have this time together. And make your weeks off without stepson a special time with your wife. \n\nAll that said, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to have a conversation around \u201cwaiting on him hand and foot\u201d. At that age, building some independence and responsibility is a legitimate concern. It doesn\u2019t have to come at bedtime, necessarily. But with basic chores around the house, teaching and expecting him to take care of his fair share of dishes, learning how to do his own laundry, or taking out trash. There is a way to balance all this.", "NAH\n\nMaybe he\u2019s struggling with split custody and really misses his mom?", "I see both sides. But I do agree with your wife. He'll only be little for a short time longer. In a year or two he probably won't want to snuggle with mommy anymore. She only sees him half the time. It's hard on both of them I'm sure. And kids bond differently with different parents. At dad's house he may not get much attention.", "Info. Has the son had therapy to address his feelings from the divorce?", "My almost 17 year old likes to sleep with me, occasionally. She likes when I fluff the blanket over her head and tuck her in. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. They\u2019re only kids for a little while and if snuggling with mom helps him feel safe and secure when, clearly he\u2019s struggling, why take that from him?

While you\u2019re not the asshole for stating the obvious, it is her kid and not yours. That being said, what happened when she doesn\u2019t have the kid in her custody? I\u2019m leaning towards NTA, but you need to talk with your wife about this and maybe see a family psychiatrist.", "I agree that she needs to be having him get to sleep on his own. Tucking him in and talking at bedtime is lovely, but she should be able to walk away and have him fall asleep on his own. \n\nI find it kind of ick the way you\u2019re saying she needs to stop attending to his needs so that she can attend to yours, though. She\u2019s got needy males all over the place.", "YTA. And the thing that makes me say that is the way you describe your own needs when this happens. You\u2019re an adult. And half the time, her child isn\u2019t there. The way you talk about it sounds as if the child is there every single night and you haven\u2019t slept next to your wife in weeks. \n\nWaiting on her 12yo, whether it\u2019s a boy or girl, is not appropriate and that will likely cause some personality/behavioral problems in the future. Him asking for cuddles? No. I will cuddle, tuck my kids in, let them come into our rooms for as long as they\u2019d like. Why? Because I know it won\u2019t last forever. One day, they\u2019ll think I\u2019m super lame and want to spend almost no extra time with me. One day, they\u2019ll be out on their own and I\u2019ll only see them from time to time. And I\u2019ll be damned if someone tells me that cuddling and falling asleep next to my child, even at 12, is damaging. A 12 year old is a child. Even if he\u2019s 13, he\u2019s a child. Even at 14. Although by that time he\u2019ll probably reach that point of teenage aloofness and not want her extra cuddles.\n\nBut yeah, if she still cutting his food, maybe tell her he needs to start doing that himself.\n\nAnd you? Don\u2019t be so needy. You can sleep solo for a few hours every other week at night. I\u2019d like to see some independence and be able to self-soothe if you\u2019re feeling anxious in those moments.", "YTA\n\nYou are 52 and you want a cuddle. Who, other than mom, is going to cuddle a 12 year old boy?\n\nHe's a good kid, no complaints right? Do you think her affectionate parenting style may have had something to do with that? Cuddling a 12 year old is not a big deal. He's been through trauma. Divorce is hard. His dad isn't affectionate. Let the kid feel safe in mama's arms for a while longer. He really won't be into it soon enough.\n\nIf you have kids together, then you get to decide together how to parent.

And she still ends up in bed with you. \n\nIf he was 14 or 15, I might address you as NTA \n\nShe won't get this time back, and the moments he will want to cuddle with mom will be fleeting, probably in times of great heartbreak for the years to come. \n\nLet her enjoy the happy cuddles & let him enjoy his mom without the pressures, This world is going to drop on his shoulders in a few years. \n\nI didn't sleep with my mother this way, I probably did with my grandmother until I was about 10.

This is borderline molestation.  Put your foot down, for his sake.", "NTA.  FFS, he's 12, not 2.  Mom is also setting a bad example for the kid's future relationships.  Example. At 25, his girlfriend gets prego, so he decides to marry her.  When she refuses to sleep with kiddo every night (like hubby expects her to) that causes drama in the marriage.\n\nThere's also the other problem.  How long a marriage lasts is directly proportional to how often hubby and wife go to bed (in the same bed) at the exact same time.  Example.  Wifey goes to sleep at 9 every night but hubby stays up till midnight or later playing video games.  Marriage fails soon.", "I think something important here is figuring out why your step son still feels this type of comfort is very necessary. So necessary that it happens every single night without fail. I had a pretty awesome relationship with my mother, and even at 26 I regularly come back and sleep in our house. However, there\u2019s rarely at point past maybe 10 years old that I didn\u2019t want to sleep alone. Independence is a big thing for every child so why is it that your step son tends to avoid his independence? I now work with kids, and while they are amazing, they develop dependencies to certain things really easily and very severely. Such as ipads and eating too much sugar. While these things are perfectly fine in moderation, if they are overdone you can see negative ripples throughout their lifestyle and life skills. I think having a conversation with your wife about how this constant and nonstop behavior sets your step son up for becoming a very adolescent preteen, and eventually a teenager. Being independent as a young boy is important to learn about personal boundaries, communication skills, and social development. While sleeping with his mom at age 12 might not necessarily affect some of these things, it\u2019s certainly hard to guess what it could affect about his development in the future. In my opinion, I think 16-18 is the age where boundaries must be drawn as your son will soon become sexually active after that age which makes sleeping with his mother extremely strange. At this point, I completely agree that you have every right to be upset as this is your partner whom you expect to spend personal and intimate alone time with. Part of that is definitely sleeping together and waking up together. I think talking to your wife directly about the fact that you do miss her and want to spend quality time like that with her will go a long way. As a woman, if I was told I was missing out on being loved by and loving the man I married, I would be upset with myself and right my actions asap. If she doesn\u2019t do that, maybe give her some time to figure out the things she is prioritizing. Sometimes we have to keep doing something over and over to realize it might not actually be working.

What is your SS's perspective on this?\n\nI'm a single mum with two teens (15F and 13M Dad has not been in their life for many years) and sometimes life can be busy with everyone having different responsibilities (work, clubs, chores, homework, extended family obligations etc) and during times when we are extra busy and one on one time is limited, both of my kids will crawl into bed with me (together and separately) for cuddles. \n\nWhen life returns to \"our normal\" and we have our other one on one time (my 15yo and I read/talk books, my 13yo and I play lego, watch whatever TV series he is into) doing the things they choose as our thing, they rarely crawl into my bed for cuddles. \n\nOn a side note, my mum passed when I was 31 (she was 49). Every Thursday (my day off work) I would go to my mum's after dropping my kids to school, and more often than not she would still be in bed (mum had some mental health issues, and when she was working, worked nights/afternoon shift). I would crawl into bed and have cuddles with mum, and we would talk. This is one of the things I miss most about mum no longer being with us. \n\nI don't think there's an age where cuddling your parent in bed is inappropriate (unless there are inappropriate things happening and that's a completely different story), and if this helps a kid feel safe and be more secure, it's an easy thing to do.", "NAH. My wife shares a bed with my six year old son, and before that with my now nine year old daughter. She's more than happy to sleep with them until they want their own space.\n\nFor her, a big part of it stems from a story about the sister of my childhood friend. She had three kids, and her youngest (3 yo I believe) died overnight from SIDS or SUDC. That cemented in her mind to never pass up on those opportunities until they tell her to get out.\n\nFor me, most nights I do enjoy having the California King all to myself.

I moved back home after my divorce from her dad and my parents house was quite large. Our favorite times together were spent at bedtime when I would tell her my version of bedtime stories, peppered with \"funny reasons\" why the golden goose hated the giant in Jack and the Beanstalk and that resulted in lots of laughter from her. In turn, she would tell me about her dreams, life wonders and what makes her happy or sad. I cherished every moment with her. She's 30 now and it seems like only yesterday.", "NTA. But that doesn\u2019t mean what she\u2019s doing is wrong. Your wife can also decide where she wants to sleep.

Sometimes people have unusual adaptive behaviour because there are gaps.", "I think asking your wife how she will cope when he gets a little older and may not want her to do that. If she is going to force it past when he\u2019s done, she has an issue. If she can see the natural end to it, then it should be self correcting and extra parent cuddles are not a bad thing.

I think OP should chill and not interfere with his partner's parenting, it is absolutely not his place to do so. He expressed his opinion, she is free to do with it as she will, including disagreeing and doing what she thinks is best. At this point I'm with you, NAH, but if OP pushes the point any further, then it would definitely tip into a h territory, imo.", "I agree about the taboo being cultural. There are MANY cultures where families share rooms and/or beds and there is nothing inhibiting about it. I think people's minds go to \"inappropriate\" for both the unspoken incesty assumptions, and for implications about how this might affect the child (key word - child) as an independent adult.\n\nI was a single mom and had an open-door policy for my kids (boy and girl). They were welcome to come in and sleep with me if they were feeling lonely, scared, just needed to feel safe, for some comfort, etc. We are very close and they are adults now, and independent, well-functioning people. I think my son stopped probably around 10 or 11. I try to hold judgement in scenarios like the OP's dealing with because of my own experience. \n\nI would say that IF the child does feel he needs his mom to fall asleep, there is probably something going on that could be addressed in therapy -- it wouldn't hurt. **OP I would tread lightly** (especially using the word \"inappropriate\"--which seems judgmental or apathetic) but maybe gently bring up exploring if the kiddo could benefit from some specialized talk-therapy. I also agree that this will likely die out on its own in the next year or so. Esp. once he starts puberty. Seems his mom is a comfort to him, so approach with support. No way do I feel like you're TAH here, I wanted to say that too.", "Love the NAH here.

If the divorce didn't happen until he was older, it affected him more than it would if it had happened when he was an infant.\n\nMy daughter is 4, and I fall asleep in her bed most nights. I get up and walk to our room so I can go cuddle my husband. The only time he \"complains\" is when I end up in her bed all night, but he doesn't throw a fit about it. He just says, \"I missed you next to me last night,\" and we move along.", "Did I say they were the same? Stop skimming and reread before you comment.", "Wow. I hope OP reads this and understand how his stepson is feeling and show a little bit of compassion and understanding.", "Perfectly put!", "Oh brother. Stepson isn\u2019t even there half the time. Let\u2019s dial it back; OP isn\u2019t deprived. He\u2019s whiny.", "Oh cry me a river. It\u2019s not every single night, maybe he didn\u2019t get attention as a kid so he\u2019s demanding it from his wife.", "He should act a certain way as a grown man. That is, don\u2019t be jealous of your (step)child who isn\u2019t there all the time wanting his mother\u2019s love and affection.", "If you did not have a partner, you would need to be able to sleep independently. \nA 12 year old does not have a partner. Mom can\u2019t be his partner.", "Well said!", "We can only go off of what is said in the text. That's what we're supposed to base the verdicts on.", "Yeah I\u2019d be concerned about the other parent or maybe something at school causing this. My friends kids tend to be super clingy, less so now at 8 and 12 with more people who care about them, but a few years ago they would cuddle with anyone who sat still long enough because their other parent does not give them any attention whatsoever, has ever changing tumultuous relationships, and is just generally being a shit parent. \n\nI\u2019d be putting my upset at not getting to fall asleep with my partner aside, and talking to her about it whether the kid is okay and how to help if not.", "But do they really need a parent right there? The next bedroom is not abandonment.  Second, in those situations, is the same room out of want or need?", "Why is 12 too old to need comfort falling asleep but 52 isn't?", "I'm not saying anything about this particular instance. I'm just saying that mindset is perpetuating the toxic patriarchy and needs to stop. The kid needs love too and I'm not saying OP is right or wrong. Let's just stop this B's that grown men shouldn't need attention from their wives.", "That's not that weird. It's nice to have alone time as a couple and those moments are fleeting when you have kids and gets compounded by the fact that there are conversations that you just can't have until the kids aren't there to hear them. Usually that reverses as kids get older and stop needing you for every task (bed time for example). I can appreciate the husband's frustration that those opportunities are not becoming more frequent as the kid gets older.\n\nIt's not about possession. The same thing would apply to a wife in a childless marriage being annoyed that her husband was spending all his time with his mates and never \"got her husband to herself.\"", "There is.", "Not sure how you got that from this conversation", "Spending time parenting is not the same as a wife spending time with friends.", "Sounds like your experience isn't universal then, doesn't it?", "You're dedicated to being \"right\" on this and not considering other perspectives I see.\n\nHave the day you deserve.", "Same to you!"]}
