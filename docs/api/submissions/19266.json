I am 7 weeks postpartum after an emergency c-section. There were some complications with both me and baby so we spent a week in the hospital after delivery making sure everyone was healthy enough to go home.

( Hubby works 4 12\u2019s so he\u2019s only home a few hours in the evening to help and he doesn\u2019t help overnight since he operated heavy machinery) Let me also say that when he is home he\u2019s super helpful and that is not taken for granted AT ALL. \n\nToday he had a tooth extracted, it was something he pushed off over and over and so the extraction ended up being a little more work than they\u2019d anticipated. When he comes home he tells me he thinks he\u2019s gonna call it an early night and go to bed soon because his tooth hurt. The level of disbelief I felt can\u2019t even be put into words. He had one tooth pulled and gets to throw in the towel on dad duties when I just had my whole abdomen sliced open and have been caring for a newborn 24 hours a day. I asked him to stay up and at least help get things together for the night (bottles washed and prepped, bath time, etc) and he said he doesn\u2019t know if he can make it that long.

It needs recovery and it causes you to be tired.

She's still not recovered. She went straight form the hospital to caring for the baby because he only had one week off...which is how long she was in the hospital for. Please don't shame OP for her birth journey. She went through a different experience than you did and detailed that on her post to make it clear WHY she's frustrated with him.\n\nHe gave no consideration for OP at all. Asking for him to do the minimum to help with care for his child and wife is not a huge ask.", "There are plenty of tasks that don't require interaction with the baby. OP mentioned cleaning/preparing bottles, I'd bet that laying out clothes for after bath, getting bath time prepped (bath filled, towels out, etc), and a host of other routine tasks could have been done regardless of his medication. Each one of those is small and relatively easy but very difficult to do while also tending to a baby. None of them require perfection, absolute attention or significant effort. \n\nOP you're NTA but your husband has just demonstrated how much he cares about your and your child's preferences/ needs and how highly yours rank against his. Pay attention to how he responds when you raise this later. 7 weeks post c section with primary childcare duties is not typically fully recovered and he had a non invasive procedure and decided his needs trumped yours. Chances are he isn't all that concerned with your wellbeing if it causes him inconvenience or discomfort and that's a problem that rarely disappears", "Many moms that have c-sections are discharged with heavy duty pain meds and are still expected to take full-time care of their babies even in the hospital.", "Its not a comparison. That's the point. The OP doesn't need to win, because its *not a competition*\n\nOP has had 7 weeks to recover, including 1 full week in hospital. Fine and fine. Her husband needs 1 night to recover. Also fine and fair. Recovery isn't a competition, but its still necessary to allow people time to recover regardless.\n\nBy her own statements, usually her husband contributes a great deal, considering the work commitments they rely on him for in order to have money to live. A once-off event where a medical produce was more complicated than expected is not a failure, its a necessity that can frustrate but does not make him an AH", "MOST Teeth can be pulled with regular local freezing.

During those 4 days, he helps for a few hours.\n\nOn the other 3 days, he is a great help.\n\nOn this day, the only one out of six weeks, which might have occurred on either one of his work days but might not have, he needed to go to sleep after having a minor surgery.\n\nIt's not a competition, but she's making it one. She is obviously just very tired from dealing with the newborn. But the husband is also not the asshole either. Needing to recover after dental surgery is fair.", "He spends 12hrs a day operating heavy machinery, comes home and looks after the baby for a few hours, and then gets what sounds like the bare minimum amount of sleep to operate the heavy machinery again the next day. On the days he doesn't do this, he is fully involved. It's not a competition, but I'd way rather be in her shoes than his.", "but she didn't get even get a night to recover. I've attended countless caesars & cared for parents immediately post-partum and the only time I've had a birthing parent not do cares for their newborn was when a woman was so critical she was sent to ICU in a coma.\n\nevery other time: the parent who just had their body ripped open doesn't get to just have a full night's sleep. they have to hold, feed, comfort their baby. They do not get a full night to recover. They have to parent.

It\u2019s not a vacation.", "Can we say it louder? IT'S NOT A COMPETITION.\n\nfrom experience, please do not start competitions.\n\nIt can escalate badly. I thought I was drowning, and my partner wasn't helping enough. He thought he was drowning. \n\nIn reality, we were both drowning (mostly from lack of sleep),  and instead of supporting each other, we were blaming each other.\n\n(Luckily, no children or babies died from our parenting, but we came very close to killing the marriage).", "It takes longer than 7 weeks to recover from an emergency C-section  FYI.... Someone woman it can take up to a year to recover...and even then there can be permanent damage and changes.\n\nShe left the hospital and went straight into full time Mom and care mode.... You're supposed to rest and be limited in movement and lifting for the first Six weeks.", "Sleeping early one night to get over anesthesia, whether local or general, after a tooth removal is also not a vacation. It is a recovery due to complications.", "Great.\nNow - she had no full night sleep after anesthesia and complications and blood loss for 7 weeks.\nDoes full night sleep recovery applies only to husbands?\nShe asked for several evening hours of help.", "The suffering olympics are not a thing.", "If she had blood loss for 7 weeks after her c-section she has bigger problems than her husband not helping for one night.", "But you're making it so by saying on that night his suffering is worse than hers so he should be allowed a recovery time. You're joining in the competition too.", "NTA, I was in horrific pain for 10 days after a root canal that caused a massive inflammatory response, I had to miss multiple days of work when I was expected to miss none.  I had to come off the pain meds to drive myself to follow up appointments and pick up prescriptions,  cook, clean, take care of my pets, and walk my dog.  I was regretting not getting the tooth pulled because the recovery would've been easier.  I also had to do all of that stuff when I had my wisdom teeth extracted. \n\nHe isn't helping because he knows she'll pick up his slack.  You can do all sorts of things if you HAVE to.  For example, if you HAVE to, you can be the main caregiver for a baby for 6 weeks after having major abdominal surgery that caused such severe complications you had to be hospitalized for a week. Also, you aren't supposed to be lifting anything more than 5 lbs for those first 6 weeks and the tiny human you're caring for gets bigger every day.  She's lucky she didn't pop her stitches.", "Of course it was unreasonable and YTA. The comparison is that after your surgery, you were immediately expected to get on with it you weren't!\n\nYou've stated that he always assists.\n\nYou always knew that pp he'd not be around with only one weeks paternity leave.\n\nToothache has actually led to people committing acts which were designated as insanity. The pain of a toothache/removal is quite unique, especially as your face, head and teeth are extremely well served by your nervous system and have many neural connections to the pain centres in your brain. Not belittling a csec, which woman would, but it's an entirely different gambit. Not to mention you were insisting on not supporting him straight after yet you're 7 weeks in to parenting. And if I'm honest, need to be getting to grips with it, as its unreasonable as a parent to need another adult that desperately to be able to function, imo.\n\nHave some empathy and sympathy.", "Um does he or doesn't he need rest to work so he can pay for the house etc you all are in??? Does he or doesn't he operate heavy machinery which he needs to be alert and rested for??? Do you or do you not want him to do those things lest you become homeless or a widow?
