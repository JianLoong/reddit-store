My boyfriend figured on the weekend we are in town, we could take one evening and go to dinner for my birthday while still dedicating the remainder of the weekend to my goddaughter. My sister thinks that\u2019s unreasonable as I\u2019ve celebrated my birthday for the past number of years and this is the baby\u2019s first event so the entire weekend should be dedicated and focused on her. To make matters even simpler, I didn\u2019t plan the dinner for myself, my boyfriend contacted my family to plan it. My sister also doesn\u2019t support the restaurant of choice which happens to be one of my favorite places. So if she were to decide to come, I\u2019d have to change venue.

Both were christened. The events were like 4 hours with the actual Christening and the celebration with family afterward. That\u2019s it. For her to think the christening needs be an entire weekend celebration is her being entitled and spoiled. Also, don\u2019t change the venue.

Your sister is. \n\nTWO events are happening that weekend: your birthday and your niece's christening. \n\nIt's perfectly reasonable to have a birthday dinner for you over the weekend. And people will still be fawning over the baby at that dinner, so your sister doesn't need to worry about people saying happy birthday to you over that meal.\n\nThe baby won't remember everything. It's your sister who wants all the attention and to control everyone's activities that weekend.", "NTA. It\u2019s the same weekend as your birthday, and as sister, she should have known it was your bd. You\u2019re travelling a long road for her girl, she could think about you for one night, especially since your family is reunited. \nShe\u2019s being selfish", "Your sister schedules the christening on your birthday weekend and then she expects you not to celebrate your birthday with your family in any way? You are definitely NTA for wanting to celebrate your own birthday for one night out of a weekend. The baby damn sure won't be coming out for dinner, so what's the issue? Your sister sounds like a nightmare.", "NTA\n\nYour sister can\u2019t hold you hostage for the entire weekend.

You should mention to your sister ... her attitude about your birthday is very unChristian.", "I don't understand why you and BF can't go out for one night while you have flown home for the christening.\n\nThe way you describe it, your sister seems entitled.\n\nThe baby won't remember this, and depending on the child's temperament, may be come highly anxious due to all the attention.\n\nYou sister doesn't have to go to your birthday dinner.

Happy Birthday.", "NTA the baby doesn\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on lmao", "NTA\n\nChristenings do not take a full 48/72 hrs.

The christening is hers, the birthday is yours. She is making it all about her and her kid, don\u00b4t let her.

Christenings are not a 2 day affair, 4 hours tops.", "NTA. I hate parents who make everything about themselves. No, not the baby, themselves because they\u2019re the ones complaining about it. Surely you can celebrate your event while the baby is still being christened. Also christenings don\u2019t take a whole weekend so yeah.", "NTA it's absolutely unreasonable to expect people to dedicate every waking hour of a weekend to an event that at most is a 4 to 5 hour thing. She's being completely unreasonable. Having dinner 1 night during a weekend that isn't dedicated to a child who literally has no idea what's going on isn't a big ask especially since it's your birthday.", "NTA: No one needs an entire weekend for a celebration, especially not for a christening. I mean, is that even a whole day celebration? It\u2019s a morning/afternoon at best. The idea that you can\u2019t celebrate your birthday on the same weekend is absurd.

I just thought it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal to take 2 hours for dinner with my parents and family I haven\u2019t seen recently I figured splitting my time between her and my parents wouldn\u2019t make her upset\u2026..

With my grandchild,  it was an hour in church  then a celebration  lunch at home.", "The last time I saw a ceremony take that much time over three days or so it was for King Charles' *coronation*. The sister sounds unbelievably self-centred.\n\nNot even the christening for his grandson, direct heir to the throne, garnered as much attention over an entire weekend as the sister seems to want.\n\nOP is **so** NTA.", "Not even a little bit. Lol.", "Yeah, it wouldn't be a big deal. To anyone but your sister. I will say again: you are NTA.", "Maybe this is a cultural thing, but where I'm from, babies sleep at night.", "Thank you.", "Yeah, and they can sleep in the stroller next to the table. It shouldn't be a regular thing, but a one-time thing is perfectly fine.\n\nBabies usually sleep a lot throughout the day. It doesn't mean you have to be stuck at home at all times.", "I mean in my immediate family that\u2019s what would happen. She doesn\u2019t feel the same. I don\u2019t argue as they\u2019re her kids and her responsibility", "Lucky you. No daytime naps? And they sleep through the night?", "Have you ever had an 8 month old? What you're describing is fine for a much younger infant, but in my culture, by 8 months many babies are sleeping through the night and have an established routine. I'd be getting a sitter. But that's not the issue at hand here - the issue is whether OP is the AH for wanting to have a birthday dinner. OP is not the AH for that, in any way.", "At 8 months, most babies are still having two daytime naps, and they also sleep at night - some are sleeping through the night, most probably are not. But I would definitely not be taking my 8 month old out to a loud restaurant at night, it would throw the whole routine out of whack. Why are we still talking about this though? It's not relevant to whether OP is the AH in this situation. My point was that OP can't take attention away from a baby if the baby is in bed, OP's sister is nuts.", "I don't have one myself. Haven't had the pleasure yet, unfortunately. But I have several friends who have/had one. They wouldn't take them out for drinks, but not once did they not go for dinner and they always took the baby.\n\nIf the kid is awake they can be in a baby chair or in someone's lap. It's not a problem missing the routine for one night.\n\nWe both agree OP is NTA and that both celebrations can happen in the same weekend.", "Personal preference I guess. I agree that we agree on the main issue.", "INFO: IS the birthday dinner the same day as the actual christening? Like, is the christening Sunday morning and the dinner is Sunday evening?\n\nHer ask is still unreasonable, but if that's the case, maybe you could compromise by celebrating on Saturday night, instead? If she doesn't go along after that, she's TA.", "NTA. Your birthday doesn't cease to exist just because her daughter was born. And if your sister chooses not to come to your birthday celebration because she doesn't get to choose the restaurant that's obviously not your fault. Not everything has to be about her.", "I was all ready to say that the godparent needs to be at the christening as that's kind of the point, but you are absolutely NTA here. A christening doesn't need a whole weekend.", "Nope. Dinner is Saturday night christening is Sunday. My boyfriend intentionally made them different days.", "Okay, your sister is being entirely unreasonable. NTA.", "NTA. Forget your sister, don\u2019t both inviting her, just invite the normal members of your family out for a bday meal", "You live at a great distance so it makes sense to arrange your birthday dinner while you are in town.\n\nBy the way, had you not planed on a birthday dinner that evening, what sort of event did your sister have in mind to extend the celebration of her child\u2019s christening. Would there be an evening church service (after all, it is a christening)?\n\nHer interest in your not going to a restaurant of her choice suggests she wants a dinner arranged in honor of her ad the baby and that should be her pick.", "NTA Your sister doesn't get a weekend because her 8 month old baby is being Christened.  She doesn't feel too dictate where you go for your birthday either, unless there is an allergy etc. \n\nSounds like your plan is interrupting her turn your birthday into a fawn over baby and mommy weekend and is now throwing a tantrum because you are mucking up the plan.\n\nI can't think of a single good or at least reasonable reason to treat the godparent of your child who is traveling 1500 miles for the christening the way she is treating you.", "NTA but your sister sure is. So go anyway, who cares what your sister thinks? She's a bit controlling and passive aggressive as evidenced by the fact that she knowingly scheduled the christening on you birthday. And it's not like the kid cares.", "GMAFB. An entire weekend dedicated to a christening lol? Tell her God doesn't expect that and he'd want you to celebrate your birthday at your favourite restaurant. NTA.", "You are both a little ridiculous. A christening doesn't need to take up a weekend and you don't have to celebrate a birthday on the actual day. NAH", "NTA and your sister is something else.", "If she decides to come, you absolutely do NOT need to change the venue.  This is for your birthday & the restaurant is of your choosing.  Not your sisters.  If she doesn't like the restaurant, that's tough shit for her.  She is being extremely selfish not allowing you to celebrate your birthday for one night.  Yes you're in town to visit your god daughter but one birthday meal is not going to take away from that.  Selfish & entitled behavior.  NTA.", "NTA. And pick the venue YOU want to go to.", "NTA. How selfish of your sister."]}
