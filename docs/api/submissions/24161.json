I was a bit confused what the big deal was so I owned up to it and said \"yeah, that was me\" and everyone around me groaned. Ava appeared angry and said \"James and Julia didn't get to eat\".

There was still plenty left, enough for Ava to count, and if anybody wanted some, they could get some.\n\nI was very embarrassed and I'm not really good at standing up for myself so I just left.

Nothing to feel remotely bad about here.", "I have never ever heard of the \"two slice rule\" and if the party planners anticipated a supply problem the answer was: a) put a sign, do something, but make sure people know the rule; OR b) just buy another pizza.", "NTA.  What is Ava, the pizza monitor?  The main rule at parties is to make sure you don't take more than your share, esp of the good stuff -- you serve yourself based on what's available and the other attendees.  Since you arrived late and there was enough pizza left, and no one shared the rule with you, taking 3 slices is fine.", "I'd say NTA because there was still enough pizza for everyone with some left over, and I am also unaware of some unspoken \"2 slice rule\" at a party unless the host specified beforehand. Counting leftover slices and doing slice math when there was still plenty left seems really awkward and weird to me?", "NTA. 'Everyone around me groaned'. What are they 14 year olds? Sounds like Ava thinks she's the pizza police? Also, being greedy with food, is a new low. Just order more. PEOPLE LIKE PIZZA! IT'S NORMAL TO WANT MORE THAN 2 SLICES.", "NTA. Three slices is not a crazy amount of pizza. Ava sounds like a controlling nightmare - who counts pizza slices at a party?!  Who creates food rules For parties?!

There is an unwritten 2 slice rule in most cases, but like you said you arrived late and it seemed like everyone ate and there was plenty left.

I've been in that situation quite a few times, and that's my thought process.  If there were 8 or fewer people, it wouldn't be a problem.  ESH, you for eating a third slice without asking, and definitely your \"friend\" who made a big deal about the whole stupid thing.  I wouldn't hang out with Ava ever again", "I mean this in the nicest way possible. I would recommend getting better about standing up for yourself. It\u2019s okay to do it, and you\u2019ll find things go better. I would wager this situation would\u2019ve played out much differently had you not up and just left after the conflict. There was clearly enough food for you to have an extra slice.", "Ava is the pizza slice police", "NTA. In my experience it is generally accepted that everybody gets two slices until everyone has a chance to eat, but after that it\u2019s perfectly fine to get more. I\u2019ve also never seen a properly planned party where there wasn\u2019t tons extra pizza, so the rule is never really matters.\n\nYou were the last to the pizza, everyone who wanted some already had some, and there was plenty left over.

I would have got out of there too.", "She wasn't even the host and she was counting pizza slices? And shamed you for taking a third slice? That's... Really not okay.

Who does that?\n\nSo, NTA - but perhaps next time, ask before you take a third slice.", "IKR?

The 3 boxes in the in the story is what was already left over after everyone else ate, not what they started with.", "Yeah that\u2019s not even close to enough pizza.   I usually assume 1/2 pizza per person.", "That is not enough at all. I usually eat a whole damn pizza, but if at a party then 3-4 slices, unless nobody else was eating it", "That explains my belly haha.
