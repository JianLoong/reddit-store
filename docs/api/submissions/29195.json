{"id": 29195, "submission_id": "17ax0ek", "title": "AITA for not helping my parents when they need it?", "selftext": "Throwaway account.\n\n  \nI (23M) am the black sheep of my family. My parents have always wanted a girl and were disappointed when I was born. When they had my little sister ( who is 21 ), she was always favored over me in any circumstance. My parents never supported me when I was on my schools soccer team and never came to any games, meanwhile when my sister joined art club, they wanted to be there and bought her expensive supplies. I never got anything I wanted for Christmas and I stopped getting gifts when I was 13, but she got anything and everything until she was 17.\n\n  \nI don't blame my sister at all. Even though I was extremely jealous of her as a kid she did make an attempt to include me in everything she was able to do and would even have tantrums if my parents told her I couldn't do this with her, forcing them to bring me along. When I got older I began to appreciate her more because of that and even felt bad for her as she was a teenage girl begging to have her own space but my parents would not give her that as she was their miracle. She couldn't even have her own job when she turned 16 because they would just give her any money she wanted which would've been more than her job was ever paying her.\n\n  \nWhen I was 18 I moved out with money I had set aside when the day did come, and my parents did not care at all. If anything they were more excited since three days after they took my sister to a week long vacation in California. I was too fed up to even be mad or sad at this and ended up going no contact with them. I only remained in contact with my sister and we would make up for the time I couldn't have with her because of my parents being with her for everything.\n\n  \nBut then something happened. After years of spending unnecessary money on my sister its now just starting to hit them how much money they really have. Rent has gone up where they live and my mother was always a stay at home mom, but now she works to help pay the rent as my dad's current job isn't enough.\n\n  \nMy sister didn't give them my contact info but they were able to get it out of my aunt, and they had called and texted me a million times to ask if I can come back home and help them out in any way I could. They didn't ask my sister, who also has a good job.\n\n  \nI asked them why should I help with anything if they didn't even know who I was. My dad argued back that we were family and family help each other. I responded by asking them what my birthday was. My dad couldn't even answer and my mom made an attempt but got it months off. I told them that should tell them everything they need to know and blocked them, but for safe measure I'm thinking about just changing my number.\n\n  \nOf course they told my other family and now they're mad at me because I'm being petty and we should all reconcile over this but I refuse to. My sister is the only one on my side and if I keep getting bombarded with texts from family then she'll be the only one I'll be in contact with.\n\n  \nAITA??\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1697651954, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ax0ek/aita_for_not_helping_my_parents_when_they_need_it/", "score": 140, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not being petty if your own parents do not remember your birthday.  If the rest of your family is so set on helping them, invite them to do so for themselves.", "NTA by a mile \n\nyour whole family excluding your sister shunned you to the point they don\u2019t even remember when you were born and clearly neglected you\n\nthe moment that they were down they wanted you to come back to help when they didn\u2019t care about you in the past. Your parents are easily TA for only wanting to talk to you when they are on the bottom. Your rest of the family can help them themselves if they have all the heat for you", "NTA. \n\n\"Of course they told my other family and now they're mad at me because I'm being petty and we should all reconcile over this\"\n\nThis isn't them trying to reconcile. They need something from you so suddenly they want you around. As soon as they don't need your help anymore they will give zero shits about you again. I would bet the bank on that.", "NTA. You have your own personal reasons and such child neglect could have affected you way more without your compassionate sister. Parents always play out this card but are not willing to change or take any responsibility for their behavior. Its not your responsibility to rake care if they can't handle their finances well. They never really supported you and from what you've told, just sound like assholes to me. It's not about petty it's about having your own life and to heal from this. They choosed to have kids, you didn't ask to be born and its not your fault that you didn't meet up their expectations. Its hypocritical of them to think that you should meet theirs now if they can't even acknowledge what went wrong. But even if they apologise, the harm has been done and you've gotten used to be on your own. It's something your parents contributed too and they can't expect from you to live after ideals they didn't even meet up too.  Do your own thing and screw them. They are adults and you are adolescent trying to figure out their own life. I may sound harsh but I experienced something similar with my absent father who wants my help now because he is sick. Its not my responsibility to heal their wounds and feed his ego. Some people need to learn the hard way that you can't get away with everything just because you're blood related.", "NTA. In your place, I\u2019d tell my parents, \u201cBed. Made. Lie.\u201d\n\nReconciliation over this might have been a nice thing to pursue, but first, that\u2019s up to you. Second, they\u2019re not open to reconciliation, because they haven\u2019t asked your golden child sister for help. So, you\u2019re still the black sheep. Still the one getting dumped on.", "NTA. Your parents were awful to you. It's also pretty telling that they're only asking this if you and not your sister.\n\nFeel free to block all the rest of your toxic family or share exactly what's going on and why you're saying no. I'm sure your parents have lied your whole life about how they treat you.", "If your family cares so much they can step up. \n\nNTA.", "NTA one bit at all, your parents didn't act like your parents so pretty much move on, of course I would say their apology should be on the table but if they don't then just be the man that they didn't deserve. Of course probably just keep in contact with your sister and I think that's about it. Otherwise, sounds like the family is just not being the family.", "NTA. As they have sown, so they have reaped.", "NTA. Your parents made their bed while pretending they only had one child, they can lie in their bed now that that prophecy has fulfilled itself.", "NTA.....holy shit", "Nta", "NTA..", "NTA. If the flying monkeys are so concerned, they can support your parents.", "NTA Your parents only consider you \"family\" when they need something from you....nope, it doesn't work that way. Sadly, I suspect that even if you did move home to help them, they would not treat you any better than they ever have and why would you put yourself in that position?", "> I responded by asking them what my birthday was. My dad couldn't even answer and my mom made an attempt but got it months off\n\nThe dad I might buy, but the person who gave birth being \"months off\" on when she gave birth is pretty fishy.", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nThey are not your family. Why should you reconcile over their wants? #they ignored your needs when you were their child. They have some cheek. \n\nSounds like your sister is a decent person and she has the measure of them.", "NTA cut off the rest too. They just want your money, not to be a family.", "NTA if they have so much loving family, then the extended family should open their pockets. Change your number and only have contact with your sister. Protect your peace and your pocketbook.", "I would text all those people. \n\nFamily loves and cares for each other. They do not neglect one child over another. They do not stop gifts at a young age while continuing with the other. They do not ignore achievements and go to things but do for another. \n\nThey try and keep in touch. They care. But yet that was NOT my life. If they did not need money, they would not have contacted me. \n\nYou say forgive, but there are some things you don't forgive, and one of them is taking out on a child what gender they were born. You want to support them and get involved in something you have NEVER done. Say you have a right or make demands or guilt me. Where were you as family to support and love me? Well, your words mean nothing. You back them then you can give them money because I have no parents. They damn well made sure I knew that. You want to try and use family as a means to get me to do what they want so YOU don't have to support them, but guess what? You were never family to a child. You never took up for me, so you can be happy in helping to support the people who neglected and made sure to prove had no love for one child. You keep up with involving yourself in something that has nothing to do with you, then you can join my parents in having no contact.", "NTA.  Continue living your life for you!", "Tell your family that your parents should only get help from people who they know well enough to know their birthday without looking at a calendar.  And that you don't make that cut.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Can\u2019t even remember your birthday?  Send them links to Social services places, and where they can get senior meals for fairly low cost.", "Absolutely NTA. The way they treated you was abominable. You don\u2019t owe them a damn thing.\n\nThe way they smother your sister is also pretty gross. She\u2019s a trouper and a good kid. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve at least got her.", "NTA, but this is also fake AF. Women generally recall things popping out of their vaginas with extreme clarity, down to the month.", " NTA tell everyone you disowned your parents years ago. However if they feel bad for them, they are welcome to give them money.", "Why is it no contact families only play the 'but we're FaMily' card when they need money and/or help? Continue to block everyone but your sister and enjoy the life you've made for yourself!", "This is the way. NTA. I am so sorry your parents are this way. Moving forward, build a family out of friends, it's even better that way...chosen family.", "\"Family can't only consider a person family when they need money. These people haven't cared about me since the day my sister was born. We're not family. I'm just someone they think they can get money out of. YOU, however, ARE family, so why don't you help them with their financial situation if it's so important?\"\n\nJust watch them backtrack.", "You actually believe that the mother doesn\u2019t remember the birthday? Does the golden child/black sheep thing happen?  Yes. But I\u2019m not buying that the mother was months off on when she gave birth.
