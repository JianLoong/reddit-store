I had planned to go to a gig just the two of us. I\u2019m not particularly excited about my birthday- I don\u2019t like getting older and this year is especially hard because my friends are all graduating uni later this year and I\u2019m only in first year because I had some health problems and then moved away to work for a few years so I started late. It\u2019s not a big deal but sometimes, seeing where my friends are in life makes me feel insecure about my own failings. Especially on my birthday when I feel I have to reflect on my accomplishments this year. I also hate being a host. It\u2019s too much pressure so I never end up enjoying myself. I told my gf this when she asked what I was doing for my birthday and she acted like she understood. \n\nBut last night, I came home from work and saw all my friends there. I had no makeup on, I was tired and the flat was a mess. I wasn\u2019t ready to see people. She had planned that all 8 of us go to the concert and then come home and have an after party at mine. It was a nice gesture and it took a lot of work on her part, which I appreciate. But as much as I love my gf and my friends, I needed that hour alone to do my makeup and get ready for the gig. I didn\u2019t need 6 people I wasn\u2019t expecting shouting surprise at me when I walk through the door and having to play host the rest of the night. My friends don\u2019t like the same music as I do so I was worried they wouldn\u2019t enjoy the show, I also have work today (i\u2019m on the way as i\u2019m writing this) so I wanted an early night. \n\nWhen I\u2019d had more to drink, I got upset and started crying and she was like \u201cAww, happy tears, right?\u201d and I explained to her how this wasn\u2019t what I wanted and I feel like she hadn\u2019t listened to a word I said if she thought it was and that the thought only counts if you\u2019re actually thinking about the person it\u2019s for. She got pissed off that I was being ungrateful. I said it was selfish of her to ruin a night I planned for the two of us and expect me to grateful for that and it ended in an argument. \n\nJust before I left for work this morning and she said next time she won\u2019t bother if i\u2019m going to be an asshole about it.

It was your birthday and you have the right to choose what you want to do. And your gf should listen to your feelings.", "NTA- this is why surprises are tricky. A big fun surprise gathering is so much fun for someone like me and apparently your GF. But someone like my wife HATES surprises. \n\nShe\u2019s a planner, being caught flat footed and unprepared for plans stresses her out to no end. It\u2019s a big difference in our love languages, and we both had to learn that about each other.  \n\nSo now I make sure not to surprise her with things (seriously, I don\u2019t even bring an occasional bouquet of flowers without consulting her because she might not have the right vase available, which stresses her). At the same time, she\u2019s learned that I need a little surprise once in a while because I think that\u2019s the spice of life. \n\nI can see why both of you are upset with the other, and y\u2019all need to talk it out and learn from this because your GF wasn\u2019t TRYING to be an AH. She was trying to do something nice. And while she might have heard what you said about the plan, she didn\u2019t truly understand why you feel the way you do- and you need to make her see it. \n\nOn another note, life is at an individual pace. Don\u2019t use where other people are as a measure of your own worth. You\u2019re so so young, you\u2019re doing absolutely fine :)", "No you\u2019re not if you wanted more people to join you then you would\u2019ve asked.  She shouldn\u2019t have invited them without consulting you first seen as it was your idea for just the two of you to go to the concert", "NTA. You told her you didn't want to celebrate your birthday with a bunch of people and a party, and she didn't listen. We often have the idea that everyone thinks the same way we do, processes emotions the same way, etc., and that's just not true. Often when someone communicates to their SO what they want and it's the opposite of what the SO wants (or what the SO *thinks* the other one wants), their default belief is \"they didn't really mean it, so I'll just go ahead with my plan and they'll appreciate it in the long run.\" Ultimately, serious communication is needed here, and like someone said, don't make it a me vs you thing; instead, make it an educational experience for both of you to learn more about what makes each of you tick. Good luck.", "I don't like surprises at all.\n\nI'd also be very confused all night and not really know how to behave myself...\n\nSo NTA.", "Nta. And a fellow sick one that is behind his friends. Yeah it sucks alot. But you need to try and stop comparing yourself and where you are in life with others. \nEvery person has a backpack with issues, some heavier then others. Ive had health issues that caused me to lag behind. It just this recent years that Ive been able to work and take care of myself again. But i try to look back more on my journey. How much Ive grown as a person. How much more things i can achieve. And that in actually stronger then i thought beacuse i beat my health issues ans came back stronger. \n\nAnd for your gf. She is an ass, its your birthday, it should be what you want. \n\nDoes she makes you happy otherwise? Are you talking to someone? \nIf i was inyour shoes i would focus more on your own health and well being. Its clear from your writing that you are tired, stressed and not feeling that great. \n\nAgain nta. And dont forget you are a warrior! Good luck and take care of yourself.", "NTA\nYour gf was fully aware of how u feel about stuff like that. It's sweet that she wanted to throw a party for you but still- the decision should be only yours to make and she should accept the way you acted afterwards. It's not your fault she doesn't listen to your boundaries", "INFO: Did you tell your girlfriend that you just wanted to go to a gig with her only, or did you say you hate celebrating your birthday and absolutely do not want a party ever? How much room could there have been for a miscommunication here?", "NAH. She tries to do something nice and thought you would enjoy. You understandably had reasons to not enjoy it. I think you just see birthday\u2019s differently and she was trying to being some joy to you. However misguided the attempt may be.\n\nYou also should not compare yourself to other people. You have a different story then they do and that\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have failings because you didn\u2019t jump straight into university. You\u2019ve got accomplishments and there is no timeline for where you are in your life.", "NAH.\n\nSounds like she interpreted \"I don't want to play host\" as \"okay I'll host it for you so you don't have to.\"\n\nYou're both right to be upset but probably not with each other. Just at the situation. Talk it over calmly if possible.", "NTA but please stop beating yourself up about where you think you should be in life and what you think you should have achieved. You are exactly where you are meant to be, so what that your friends are a year ahead of you at uni, you are at uni which is a great thing. Everyone has their own path to take and you are on yours, don't compare to others or you'll always feel down on yourself as you'll only compare the bits of their lives that seem \"better\" than yours.\n\n At 22 you hopefully have another 60 years ahead of you so enjoy your journey - good and bad for what it is - your journey!\n\n As for your birthday, your girlfriend's heart was in the right place and she did what she did hoping to make you happy. Have a chat with her, tell her you appreciate what she arranged and her as a person but you struggled with the evening because x/y/z. \n\n Good luck with uni and everything that comes after \ud83d\udc9a", "NTA. Not at all. Honestly, it was disrespectful that she crossed a boundary that you clearly set. The fact that she put in effort is a bad hill to die on considering you told her exactly what you wanted. You were a good sport to go out anyway, but didn\u2019t deserve the extra stress she put you through. \n\nI hopes she takes some accountability for that and is able to really listen to you and at least try to empathize. If not, that\u2019s something you should really look at moving forward. \n\nI\u2019m sorry it went this way on your name day. Wish you the best.", "NTA.  From your comments your GF invited 6 people to your flat without your permission when you hadn't had time to clean etc, made plans for a long evening involving a concern and after party after you'd already had a long day at work and had to work early the next day.  The fact that she invited these people to your flat and not her own means you'd technically be hosting.  This was NOT a nice gesture, it was a selfish and inconsiderate one after you'd already told her you wanted something quiet\n\nEta based on op's further comments.  OP communicated she wanted a quiet celebration.  GF proceeds to invite 6 people over to OP's flay without permission and then expected OP to take care of/host everyone after the concert.  This wasn't a surprise party for OP's birthday, particularly when GF made op host.  This was GF using op's birthday to have a good time while forcing op to host GF and the others.  At best OP's GF is naive and extremely thoughtless.  At worst she know op doesn't like to host and prefers quiet birthdays but GF decided to have her own party and enjoy herself while using OP's bday as an excuse all the while GF was being a massive asshole", "This one is tricky. I want to say NAH leaning NTA because it seems like initially more of a misunderstanding based on you two not being on the same page. Sometimes we think people got our message but our forms of communication don\u2019t quite line up and it turns out they missed half of it, so I wouldn\u2019t jump to assuming she didn\u2019t care or cared more about her own needs. But you both really leaned into it, maybe because of the alcohol factor, and it snowballed more than it needed to.\n\nI think you should both try your best to give each other the benefit of the doubt on this matter, wait a little bit to let the dust settle and emotions to be processed, then have a sit down in person conversation with an \u201cus vs the issue\u201d\napproach (as opposed to the ever-failing \u201cyou vs me\u201d approach) and work on communication and boundaries. \n\nThe way you talk about how this happened makes it sound like this might be your first birthday in this relationship, which also tells me it\u2019s relatively new. It\u2019s normal to have bumps like this, but if you two are both genuinely prioritizing one another the bumps will get easier every time.", "NAH\n\nIts your birthday and you can have it anyway you want but I think you need to understand where your GF was coming from, and I think that was a place of you having a good time, maybe she though by throwing you a surprise party it would elevate the stress you have with them. Either way I dont really see any malice in what she did, albeit it asnt what you want.\n\nI do think though there is an issue with aging you really need to look into. You are 22 and having these bleak thoughts, I can only image what you will be like in your 50s!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
