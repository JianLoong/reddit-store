Who\u2019s the AH?", "NTA. Her children should have taken care of her, and asked for help from the grandchildren during the event if needed. Since it\u2019s your mum\u2019s wedding she has a reason to have been preoccupied, but your uncle has no excuse. Is he someone who thinks because he\u2019s a man he doesn\u2019t have to do any caring duties? I can\u2019t imagine treating my own mother like he did.", "NTA - your uncle already accepted the responsibility to bring her back and shouldn\u2019t have left someone in heels to do it. \nEspecially because he didn\u2019t even check in before leaving.\n\nThere should have been transportation organized for her to go to and from. But ultimately that\u2019s not your responsibility.", "NTA. You were not there as her carer, but to support your mum. You should have hired a carer to mind your grandma so everyone could have enjoyed the wedding.", "I need a little more information.\n\nYou knew that a dependent 90 year old lady would be invited to the wedding, what were the plans ? Who was supposed to look after her ?\n\nEdit : NTA", "NTA at all.", "NTA. The only job your uncle had was to drive grandma to and from the wedding. He\u2019s the AH and you should tell him. Especially if this is his mother, he should be ashamed!", "NTA. He said he\u2019d bring her home, it\u2019s not like you abandoned her before he got there, and you were caring for her all night. \n\nIt must be so sad to be surrounded by family that you went to the trouble of seeing when it\u2019s difficult for you to even be mobile, only for all of them except 2 to ignore you the WHOLE NIGHT and then flake on you when you ask them to bring you home. That\u2019s so sad.\n\nI\u2019m assuming the uncle is her son, I can\u2019t IMAGINE basically abandoning my own mother when I need to take her home because it\u2019s slightly inconvenient, let alone ignoring her all night. Good on you for caring for her so well the whole night.", "Yta. As someone who works in a nursing home if my grandma was still around I\u2019d be GLAD to help her. Being in a nursing home sucks. It\u2019s the worst way to spend your remaining time alive.", "YTA, she is your grandmother, I bet she bent over backwards and treated you well while you were young. Like you said, 5 minutes away, yes you helped her throughout the wedding. I would have considered it an honor if I could do that for my grandparents just one more time.", "YTA\n\nGrandma won\u2019t be around forever.

Sound like a bunch of teenagers!", "NTA.\n\nIts a shame no one else seems to be caring for grandma, and it sucks they use your job as an excuse to make it your problem. I hope grandma didn't know this happened, because she doesn't deserve to be used a prop (You didn't btw, your family did). Reminds me a lot of a friend who's sister invites her to sister+husband+kids vacations, only to stick her with the kids 90% of the time so they have 'vacation together' because shes a prek teacher. They know she can't afford trips to the caymens or whatever, but she rarely gets to explore more than the hotel pool cause shes babysitting the whole time.", "Nta, but your uncle is. He brought her to the wedding and agreed to take her home and then just left the wedding without her, without making sure that his mother had a way home. He\u2019s just calling you an AH because he\u2019s mad that he has to follow through on what he said he was going to do. If he wanted to leave early he either should have taken grandma home early, or made sure she had a way home.\n\n But also, the rest of your family kind of sucks too. The fact that no one could be bothered to make sure that grandma was taken care. Thankfully grandma has you otherwise it sounds like she would have sat there hungry, thirsty and all alone with no one to talk to and no way to get to the bathroom. You sound like a good grandchild", "NTA\n\nOP, as they're going to assign you as caregiver without even checking it with you first, why don't you simply not attend these functions?\n\nLet them deal with it instead of passing the buck to you and enjoying themselves.\n\nYes, they'll scream at you and throw themselves around. Let them. Do not allow anyone to leave work to you that they should do themselves.", "I believe he is yes. I know my mum has been really stressed out with him because he doesn't want to help with anything. My mum and I had to clear my grandmas house out for selling it, he wouldn't come help with that. Anything health related or care home related gets passed straight to me, but I slightly understand that, I have a lot of experience in that sort of area. But walking your mother home doesn't require any sort of special knowledge.", "The transportation was unfortunate. As I said the home didn't tell us until last minute that my grandma wouldn't be able to get in the car, usually she can. We rang for a disabled taxi but couldn't get any last minute on a Sunday.", "It was already planned that she would be sitting at my table, so I assumed I would be helping her with her drinks/food. There were no plans so to speak for when she needed the toilet or standing up. Nor were there any plans for conversing with her. I assumed that at least someone else in the family would help me with her and keep her company.", "I know she won't be around forever. Currently, apart from my mum, my partner and I are the only ones who go see her regularly in the home. We also tried to get her moved into our house rather than a care home, but we don't have enough downstairs space. I just thought it wouldn't have killed my uncle to take her home how he'd arranged, rather than leaving and expecting me to take her back.", "My bad, I seemed to have missed that part", "I think you should have planned for her presence and alternated so that you weren't the only one dealing with her care. The way you talk about it, it sounds like you're resentful of having handeled it all. You couldn't reasonably expect other guests to come and get her a drink on their own, they weren't necessarily malicious, they must have assumed she was someone's responsibility.\n\nAs for your uncle, he clearly did something wrong. He was the one who was supposed to drive her home and he deliberately pretended to forget so that you would do it for him.", "I was slightly resentful, but I would say only because no one else was helping and it's not like it was a quick thing. Taking her toilet took about 20 - 30 minutes each time, during which I missed my mums first dance with her husband. The drink situation, my brother sat there next to grandma and didn't offer to get her one, which also annoyed me. The conversation situation I found appalling, that several family members never even come to sit with her for 5 minutes for a chat. Talking to grandma shouldn't be a pre-assigned responsibility.", "I understand and I have the impression that you were more a caregiver than a guest during the wedding. Given the amount of help your grandma needs, the bride and groom should have planned a better division of tasks.\n\nI agree with you that they should have talked to her, and I think that shows how little consideration they have for her. Unfortunately, the elderly often end up with a handful of people who care about them even though they have a large family.", "NTA", "Complete AH, do anything you can to help out a 90 year old no matter how shit their family is.", "oooo boy, cant wait for the day when he is looking around for someone to wipe his butt. And no one helps", "Did you ask people to help? Ask your brother to get drinks,  etc.?"]}
