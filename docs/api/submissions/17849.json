It's perfectly understandable that you've planned to go to this concert for a long time and don't want to skip out on it.\n\nThings like diet can be hard to control for people, and smoking can get extremely addictive. He's 50 years old and has lived his whole life a certain way. He's not going to be able to completely change his life in a couple years without extensive help. He probably knows that it would be good for him to change but actually doing it is hard. Do you think he likes having these medical issues?", "Info- was he a good father? Did he abuse you in any way? Did he work to provide for the house, or of your mother worked, did he care for you around the house?", "YTA. sorry but if your father is in need of help to do simple tasks such as go to the bathroom and your the only one available to help him then you should be helping him", "YTA \n\nConcerts will come and go. You only have one dad.  I think it\u2019s so selfish to say that someone chose to bring me into the world\u2026that was there choice alone and so I don\u2019t have any responsibility towards them. Family is about caring for each other. Maybe you\u2019ll understand that when/if you become a parent yourself. \n\nGet over yourself and help the family.", "YTA\n\nI pray and hope that if you\u2019re ever in a health situation like this the people in your life display more empathy and compassion than you are showing your own father. Pretty cold hearted to say the least", "There\u2019s a 50% chance he\u2019ll be dead within 5 years. He can\u2019t get to the bathroom without help. The fact that you don\u2019t show any sympathy towards him despite saying he was a good father is heartbreaking. You prioritized a concert over your mother and brother\u2019s jobs and your father\u2019s safety. YTA", "INFO: When were you invited to this concert? Was this a last minute invite or planned a while ago?", "YTA.  You have no empathy.", "INFO: Do you love your Dad? Do you want him to know it?", "INFO: do you understand that people die from what is happening to your dad right now? Are you prepared to go to a concert and live with the memory of not helping him and going out instead? You have to live your life of course, but this situation is more serious than you're giving it credit for. Sometimes we miss out on things that we want to do at times like these. You're obviously old enough to make the decision yourself, but maybe not old enough to understand how it may effect you and your dad in the future, possibly the near future.\n\nI'm saying this because this is precisely how my dad died last year. I would do anything for the chance to hang out with him for an evening and help him go to the bathroom. Just keep it in mind when you're deciding what you will regret the least.", "If your dad was an awful parent and staying with him meant putting your safety - emotional or otherwise-  at risk, then I could understand. But otherwise YTA. You have one dad. There will be more concerts.", "YTA. Big time too. This is your dads medical problem sure but when family goes through emergencies sometimes plans have to change. A concert doesn\u2019t trump caring for a parent. Also big asshole move to blame him. Sure lifestyle choices are why he\u2019s in a bad position, but addiction is real, and this man presumably cared for you for years. Time to step up and return the favour. Don\u2019t be an ungrateful brat.", "YTA\n\nOnly for the attitude towards your dad.", "I would choose my dad every time.\n\nYTA", "YTA.  A concert is not more important than your dad.  Looks like you are already blaming him for his illness and are not going to be there for him.  Google the life expectancy of someone with heart failure, chances are he won\u2019t be here long and you are already treating him like crap.", "YTA. In a similar situation with the lungs, though quite a bit older. Being told \"well, you brought it on yourself\" and pretty much ghosted in my end stage, it's heartbreaking.", "YTA are you still living at home? Does his effort and money still fund your life? Help your dad", "Info: do you also live with them, and if so what do you provide towards the household?", "YTA. I think you're well aware you're an asshole. In fact, I sincerely hope you're just a troll making stuff up. Smoking is an addiction arguably harder to beat than drugs or alcohol. My dad was a life long smoker. So was my nan. I lost my nan to lung cancer and my dad to emphysema. Both as a direct result of smoking. I would never, ever have dreamed of treating either of them with such a disgusting lack of respect and empathy as you are allegedly treating your dad. One day, he won't be here. And you will look back on this moment and realise with horror what an almighty asshole you were.", "YTA  If it's any consolation, I think there is a pretty good chance that your lack of empathy will change as you get older.  Time has a way of making you understand that when someone is gone(as your dad soon could be) that you can't change a goddamn thing about the past.   Discovering that can hit you like a ton of bricks.", "NTA they cab ask and you can and did say no. Just cause parents chose to have kids, unplanned or planned, doesn't mean the kids are automatically caretakers when they are sick or old or both. He's knows he's sick and still chooses to make poor decisions. I mean if it was different and he made the effort and stuck with trying to do better, my verdict might sway slightly. Why can't yall afford a nurse for these situations?", "YTA.  Since the other two are working and you are not, you should help.  Do not like that?  Since you are 19, move out on your own.", "NTA you\u2019re young and allowed to have your own life. I think as his daughter you should help out sometimes but that\u2019s on your terms. Don\u2019t go blaming your dads illness on him though, that\u2019s really messed up. None of us are perfect and you might find yourself in a bad situation of your own making someday.", "YTA. Smoking and overeating is an addiction. It\u2019s hard to recover from these with no support from family, and I\u2019m presuming you are not the most supportive daughter.", "YTA. Your Father needs help and it looks like he doesn't have the support..", "NTA and I'm gonna say something here that a lot of people in this post will disagree with. They all say not to blame your dad for his unhealthy eating habits and smoking because they're an addiction. That's a fair point those are addictions. But here's the thing about addictions (also applies to some mental illness) It's not their fault they have an addiction but it is their responsibility. Yes he's 50 and it's hard to change habits that old but he's the grown up you're only 19 you're more child than adult, why would they put in you a responsibility that should be for a nurse especially since he has made little to no effort to change.", "Yes you  are.  How awful can you get?  Are your parents  honestly  nothing  to you? No appreciation  on  your  part because  they  bought  you into  the  world? Is that really  how it works  in your  mind?", "Soft YTA. You\u2019re old enough to know better. You\u2019re to young know that dad will not be on this earth forever, and you will miss the hell out of him. Do better", "NTA\n\nA kind person would stay with your dad. But i won't call you an A for not doing it. He kills himself and its not on you to carry the consequences", "NTA. But yeah, I agree with other posters that you can't blame his conditions on him. It'll be a lot of people telling you it's not his fault. You need to keep those thoughts to yourself.", "YTA be there for your father family needs you.", "YTA \n\nBy your own words he was a good father. You\u2019re very fortunate. But you\u2019re also extremely selfish. I hope to God you never need anything from anyone. Especially your father.  And I hope when he\u2019s gone, you realize how shitty you were being right now. Because you\u2019ll never get him back to apologize to once he\u2019s gone. And you will have to live with that. So, when he\u2019s gone and you have a blast remembering that concert you went to, remember who you left behind for it.  K? Enjoy!", "Yeah your dad could die anytime with heart failure..but you go to thst concert...I hopethe guilt eats you...you're attitude is so bad..I don't why they brought you in this world..maybe because they had to endure you ...I'm with your mom and brother...you're the biggest selfish asshole ever", "NTA....go to the concert. Have fun", "NTA from me. You make bad choices daily for fifty years it\u2019s gonna backfire on you. Just make sure you don\u2019t follow in his footsteps!", "NTA. You had plans and presumably tickets that were already paid for. I am your Dad's age, and I cannot imagine asking my son (a bit older than you) to cancel plans like that at short notice.", "NTA. Since your mother and brother seem to work at night, does this mean you would be the permanent night time caregiver? Time to get home health involved", "YTA.\n\n\nNobody chooses to get sick and i don't see how smoking and his heart disease are related.\nYour family needs you to help take of your dad. There will be other concerts.", "YTA...\n\nDo not put the blame on him, when your mom apparently let him eat junk food", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

As parents, we have a responsibility to keep,ourselves healthy so the kids don\u2019t become caretakers at an early age.  That said, you need to develop some sympathy.  Yes, he did this to himself.  However that ignores the plethora of issues that lead to food addictions; nicotine addiction is well documented, so he should be granted some grace.", "NAH\n\nThere are a lot of people out there commenting who have no idea what this is like for you. I however know exactly what this is like. My dad smoked his entire life, overweight, bad diet, no exercise, and grandparents and parents who had heart attacks, heart disease, and open heart surgeries. He had four stints by the time he went into heart failure. He got a heart transplant a few years back. I know 100% what it is to be looking at him full of anger at his refusal to accept responsibility for how he contributed or how he ignored his own genetics, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure.\n\nYou are not an ass for continuing your life despite his illness. Your family are not asses for being annoyed that you won't watch him. It is a stressful, crap situation and every one is having to figure out how to live while also being caretakers. (Just wait for caretaker fatigue). Your anger is justified, your continuing your life is justified. I would highly suggest therapy to help you process an emotion that will never have satisfying release with the person it is directed at.\n\nGood luck dealing with everything here.", "Awful attitude, dread to imagine what your like", "YTA You seem very selfish.\n\nLet\u2019s imagine you had a car accident where you were at fault. Your injuries make it impossible for you to care for yourself. How would you feel if your family abandoned you to go to a concert?", "YTA. Not because you said no-- you had plans and you were not obligated to cancel them for your father. But you have to understand that refusing to care for someone because they didn't eat or exercise the way you think they should is a dangerous game to play. No matter how perfectly you think you live, that can be thrown right back in your face. \n\nWhat if you caught COVID at this concert? What if you broke your ankle while there? By your own logic, you deserve no help from your family because they didn't think you should have gone. They would be wrong for thinking that, and you're wrong for thinking your father deserves to suffer for his life choices.\n\nIt sucks that people don't always take care of themselves. It's perfectly justifiable to be upset at watching someone worsen their health for simple pleasures like smoking or junkfood. It does not justify abandoning them in their time of need. We are all human, we all have our vices, and we all deserve to be cared for when we can't care for ourselves.\n\nGo to the concert, have a great time, and then be there for your dad. Don't play stupid games. You'll win stupid prizes.", "I\u2019m not sure why all these people are commenting Y T A. Maybe they didn\u2019t grow up with an addict for a parent? It\u2019s easy to have compassion for circumstances that are not your own. But you are NTA. Your dad is a grown up and he has made all of his own decisions that got him here. Addiction is hard. But recovery is possible. Did he ever go to rehab? Did you every tell him to stop eating this way and think about his health? About you and your brother? \n\nMy dad had constant health problems and was in and out of hospitals my whole life. He refused to change his diet, go to rehab, or even admit he had a problem. By the time I was 19, I was more than fed up. Why was I made to feel responsible for my parent? I\u2019m the child! I\u2019m supposed to be the one being looked after, not him! Those are all completely normal and rational feelings to have given your circumstances. I was also 20 when my dad died. My only advice is to be honest with your dad and say your truth. How you resent him for choosing X Y Z over you. But also acknowledge that you love him, and all of these feelings are coming from a place of deep hurt and love. Maybe you want to help him, but you don\u2019t want to give up your life to help him if he\u2019s just going to continue on this same path. I would recommend seeing a therapist and talking to someone about these things too. It will help, trust me!", "You're 19 it's actually your job to take care of yourself.

That's not 1950; we were well aware of how bad smoking was for you at that time and cancer lung pictures were all over the place. That's not misinformation, he made a choice to smoke that long and is now racing the consequences of that choice. It's not on OP to bridge the gap for his bad choices.", "Exactly what I was going to ask. Like, is there some deeper reason why OP hates her father? Abuse? Neglect? Excessive strictness? Mysoginy? Just generally being a deadbeat dad? \n\nOtherwise OP just seems really callous and heartless to have absolutely nooo empathy towards their father. I get it can be hard watching someone eat/smoke themselves into an early grave, but even so. If you love them, you're there for them. At least see that he has *someone* there to help him in an emergency. I'd feel absolutely horrible if I'm out partying at a concert and come home to find my dad suffering horribly, or lying in a puddle of his own piss or something with no one to come to his aid. But that's just me.", "Yes, he provided for the house and would give me money any time i ask and he cared for me, however sometimes he get angry and throw some hurtful words", "It was planned 4 days ago before my dad got sick.", "Then she can't be surprised when she is no.longer allowed to live there or recieve any help from them.", "No one WANTS to put that kind of responsibility on their child, but jeez, empathy is a thing you know... especially for your own family. My dad struggled with smoking for years. Most of my childhood in fact, and he quit many, many times. Unfortunately, he also struggled with depression, and the cigarettes were his coping mechanism, so he always ended up back on them in the end. He got diagnosed with emphysema. Fought it for seven years, and I was damn well with him until the end. Why? because I loved him. And it matter not one bit how responsible he was, or whether it was fair to me. Same with my nan's lung cancer, also from a lifetime of smoking.", "And don't be surprised when they kick her the fuck out.", "I think this is a temporary situation right now, while Dad recovers from his respiratory illness. If he continues to be this weak, that is a whole other conversation, but in home help is expensive, and they will most likely need that for later, right now it's short term.", "Wait, you really don't understand how smoking and heart disease are related?", "Literally says on the sides of cigarette boxes that smoking causes lung and heart problems.", "Smoking and obesity is well recognized risk factors for developing heart failure, also the doctor said he got it cuz of his unhealthy life style", "\"Let him,\" like she's his keeper and he's not an adult who makes his own decisions.", "It\u2019s not a spouses responsibility to monitor what another adult eats", "There was still a big social aspect of smoking, it being seen as \"cool\" during that time period. Nobody is saying that she needs to constantly take care of her father, this sounds like a one time favor. I wouldn't be surprised if OP would rather leave her father laying on the ground than help him out of pettiness. \n\nIt's not like her father was directly like \"I know I have health issues due to smoking, but I don't care and I'm going to purposefully keep smoking and force my family to take care of me.", " People still smoke today because of trauma, anxiety, depression, a range of factors. A little empathy goes a long way.", "OMG. You mean...he's human?", "Being imperfect is a human quality.   You are also human.   Do *you* ever get angry and throw hurtful words?"]}
