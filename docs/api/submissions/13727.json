But most normal plates, cups, silverware and cookware are just fine. \n\nAlso, if my dishes are damaged by the dishwasher, they can be replaced. Nothing can replace the part of my soul that dies each time I have to hand wash dishes. \n#overdramatic #butseriouslytho", "Yep! I keep a lot of expensive things that can't be dishwasher exposed, BUT I also keep a lot of things that are dishwasher safe. So I explained to my partner the \"rules\"... E.g. \"If the handle is attached via tangs, no dishwasher. If it's cast iron, no dishwasher, if it's thinner than our silverware, no dishwasher. If it's plastic, top rack. If it's small or delicate, top rack. All baby dishes are top rack. Wood should never be left wet, so no dishwasher.\" And we have never, not once, had a problem. They have never had a dishwasher before living with me, and I've almost never not had a dishwasher. But the rules, once explained, are super simple. If you don't trust your partner with that, you don't trust your partner. And maybe you shouldn't be partners...?", "And your water bill shrinks as well", "I usually assume that anything that's been through a freaking KILN is probably going to be okay in a dishwasher!", "Side note, but there are roll away dishwashers that you can attach to the sink faucet. They're a bit less convenient but better than nothing. There's also small portable countertop dishwashers which don't hold much but it can help a lot to be able to toss all the silverware in instead of doing by hand or washing the plates from that nights dinner daily or something", "I have a ton of dishes I wash my hand instead of the dishwasher because it f**** them up. The lids for my Pyrex Tupperware are plastic and melt a little in the dishwasher. I have a lot of metal enamelware the dishwasher knocks around and cracks the enamel off revealing the metal underneath which then rusts. Also lots of glass/pyrex that have limited edition prints on the outside which I know gradually wears off if you dishwasher it every time.\n\nOP is still the ah. If her bf won't separate the stuff that needs to be hand washed, she should just put it up somewhere only she can use it. And he's the ah for not caring enough about her needs. ESH", "\ud83d\ude11", "Yeah, back in the \u201880s dishwashers were a bit rougher and you might damage fine china or stemware. These days there\u2019s hardly anything that\u2019s going to get physically broken in a halfway decent dishwasher.", "In fact, we just found out that if the dishes go in actually dirty still they get cleaner than if we washed them off because that\u2019s what they are meant to do now", "Ohh I never thought about that til now. I bet they do smell lovely after a day outside. I always liked the smell of line dried bedding", "Oooooo I like where you\u2019re going with this\u2026how \u2018bout the tennis ball shooter? Take the mats down to the city courts and set up this rug beating rack for 5 minutes! Cheap and quick\u2026", "That's what I tell my clothes before indiscriminately throwing them in the washer. If you cannot survive the crucible you do not grace my home.", "I rinse mine, but I picked that habit up when I wasn\u2019t running the dishwasher as often (living alone) and when I visited 2 friends that didn\u2019t rinse and only ran theirs like weekly.   The smell that came out every time it was opened!  *gags*\n\nFor me, a quick rinse is totally worth it not smelling like death inside if it takes a few days before a wash for whatever reason.  Not because it needs the dishes to be rinsed to get them clean, but so they don\u2019t smell up the place before it runs.  \n\nIf we do big family dinner though, and it\u2019s going from empty to full and maybe even a second loaf after that?  I\u2019ll only rinse out of muscle memory/ habit for a second before catching myself and stop, and then everything just goes in.\n\nBut rinsing has its place.", "the only ones I 'pre wash' are the really caked on stuff like some of my baking pans that never come out clean unless I get off every food crumb on them. But yeah, generally scraping and putting in is enough.", "The only thing I rinse off is ketchup or other tomato remnants cuz that will stain everything plastic an annoying tinge of orange", "Oh they\u2019re great. I used to clean houses, and if the clients were providing the supplies I had to start by cleaning their cleaning supplies, YouTube was always my go-to for how to deep clean the clothes and dishwashers. I got SO many bonuses because their dishwasher suddenly worked again. Or their clothes washer no longer did X thing. \n\nClean your cleaning stuff.", "In addition to good knives--I have a nice set of Thiers Sabatier knives--cast iron cookware, carbon steel pans, and copper cookware should never see the inside of a dishwasher.", "I basically swapped out our sponges for either dishwasher-safe silicone scrubbers or washcloths with embedded scrubby fabric (which then get put in the clothes wash with the towel towels on sanitize settings). \n\nSponges exist in our house for soaking up messes and scrubbing stuck on gunk off the sink (which then gets cleaned with a different silicone scrubby)", "Have you ever tried powdered dishwasher detergent? that stuff is what everybody should be using, I don\u2019t care what any manual or pod-bag says at the store. the brands that sell pods purchase ad-space \u201crecommendations\u201d from appliance companies, which is why you get a GE dishwasher that comes with a \u201csample\u201d of diamond dish pods or whatever. they don\u2019t get stuff clean, they can leave residue or build up on your dishes or inside your actual dishwasher, and they\u2019re expensive. A box of dish detergent that lasts for like three months or more? $3 at big grocery stores. works perfectly, goes in both the closing compartment and the pre-wash section. I\u2019ll be telling people about dish powder til I die", "I legitimately thought that's what it was? WTF is a \"warming drawer?\" LMAO.", "I have totally used the warming drawer to keep some dishes warm when serving a fancy dinner.  Also to proof bread dough.  \n\nNot ALL the time, mind you - but some times !", "I never knew it was a warming drawer! \nI thought it was just extra storage space for cookie sheets and other misc kitchen junk.\nIs this a true fact?", "Tbf, not all of them are warming drawers. Some are just for storage. There are also ones that have a separate ability to broil, all fancy like. But even the ones with no separate controls will get warm due to being directly under a heating element. That\u2019s what Google told me anyway.", "I entirely understand, technically I can put my toilet brush in the dishwasher with my dishes, but I\u2019m not going to because icky", "I must also have this in my lexicon", "This is how the zombie apocalypse starts.", "My parents got separated because the dishwasher broke and wasn't fixed.", "I don\u2019t have a dishwasher and when I read about people who intentionally don\u2019t use theirs I want to blow up the entire solar system. We are basically constantly washing dishes here and if we lag behind even one time, the job balloons to like a 1.5 hour ordeal.", "It's ridiculous. They're literally designed to run at temperatures that would destroy our hands. They miss bits if you pack them badly or don't refill the salt, but fundamentally they are way better at actually cleaning/sanitizing dishes than a human could manage without burning their hands.", "It means that OP knows her way of thinking is kooky but refuses to do anything about it. That poor partner of hers - how many other times does he hear this excuse and is expected to just surrender to her \"neuroses\"?", "My husband is a wonderful, smart, kind, loving partner. I\u2019ve lost count of how many times he\u2019s run nonstick pans, wooden spoons, good knives and cutting boards through the dishwasher.", "Our dishwasher broke last November. Early November. We went and got a new one within about a week. It arrived December 22nd. We had to do thanksgiving and one Christmas dinner along with three birthdays without it. Our water bill DOUBLED. Dishwashers save money and hand washing is terrible on the hands. And super tedious. The new one will have paid for itself by the end of summer in water savings from hand washing, but the savings on my marriage is priceless.", "I do use cleaning vinegar instead of fabric softener, because I once had an old washing machine that would build up this horrible black gunk and someone told me it was residue of fabric softener.", "I thought I was a spoon until I was 5. I got baths in the sink and I slept in a drawer.", "Ha!", "Dishwashers were invented in the mid 19th century specifically because an aristocrat thought their maids were damaging their things too often and wanted them to be cleaned more safely. The first machines  had too many moving parts and then too much pressure so were worse than the maids and they didn't really become safer than hand washing until the mid 20th century when pressure sensors/control-systems became more widely available\n\n....assuming they're not a time traveller I'd still say YTA but the reasoning behind their choice is kinda understandable imo", "I\u2019m really picky about the kinds and quality of foods I eat, so I do all the cooking. It\u2019s pretty straightforward.", "My wife and I are pretty much the same way as you on laundry, except I'm the one that likes it a certain way. My problem with the situation we have is that now I've ended up doing about 90% of the laundry in the house. She doesn't mind throwing her stuff in with mine and the kids have started to complain that their clothes don't come out as well when she does it, so I got stuck doing theirs too. Just stinks that now I'm stuck doing EXTRA laundry instead of just my own because I'm the picky one. I don't mind doing an extra load or two, but now I'm doing basically all of it. At least it evens out in the end. She's picky about a few things that I'm not that she ends up doing, so I guess I shouldn't complain too much about it.", "I was a really poor college student at the time, those cheeses were my only luxury item. \n\nThanks, she was awful.", "I'm a lucky one whose home came with a proofing closet!

I\u2019ve never had a dishwasher before I moved into my current apartment and the improvement in my quality of life has been immense. I hope I never have to live without a dishwasher again.

You're eating, not performing surgery with the butter knife. It doesn't have to be sterile.", "Thissssss! I\u2019m not super grossed out by my dogs slobber or anything, but I am weird about my bathroom and sex stuff. No one is going down on me after a club. I will be getting a shower first.

I'll take my lumps./\n\nI have never related to a statement on such a spiritual level. I never knew the words to explain this very real thing that happens quite frequently!!"]}
