What they are asking for is your first born child to be raised away from you.  She will be \u201cheart broken\u201d but that is due to her largely unrealistic expectations.  Please do what is best for you and your family (husband and child) instead of catering to the expectations of parents who already had their chance to raise their own children.", "NTA- I would just say thank you but no thank you. You and the baby's father will raise the child and they are welcome to come to visit (knowing that they live far away and most likely won't).", "NTA - Say \"Thanks, but no thanks\".", "Say no and that\u2019s it", "NTA. It is not feasible for you to leave your baby with your parents. It's also understandable that you don't want your dad to get a lot of time in with your child. They got their time to be parents and now it's yours. I'm trying to figure out why you aren't NC with them.", "NTA. There may be no way to tell them without upsetting them, but don't let them being upset keep you from stating your boundaries and plans. This is your child, not theirs. (Not to mention that the distance is far too far for your parents to even babysit). Get the day nanny.", "NTA -however,  you need to firm up your spine NOW.

Practice the conversation with your partner. Role play all the different scenarios your parents will throw at you to try to get their way so you're prepared, then just get it over with. Bottom line is you are two hardworking, responsible adults looking forward to raising your son together.

I did not want that (even though I absolutely love my mil), so I gently told her no, and said that I want her to be fully a grandma and not obligated to be a babysitter.  I also said I want her to feel like she can do her own fun things and enjoy retirement.\n\nShe was a little annoyed at that, but after a year (and some emergency daycare babysitting), she  told me how happy she was that I had told her no.", "NTA I don\u2019t understand, your mom has decided you will just be dropping your child off with her that far away and just coming to visit?

Make it clear that you will be raising your baby.", "NTA, but I'm worried because you don't know how completely fucking insane this is and you need to. You're parents are nuts. They're planning to remove your child from you and raise it themselves, this is bizarre and terrifying op. You have to stop worrying about niceties and tell your mom that you're the only people raising your baby. \n\nYou are not a child! They can't force you to do anything! They have no power here!

The fact that you felt you needed to write the situation here shows exactly why they shouldn\u2019t ever be in charge of your kid.

Get the nanny and tell your mother that arrangements have been made for the child's care. She broke her own heart by assuming that she would be the daycare when she lives way too far away to even do so.", "NTA. This is also the perfect time to finally set boundaries with your parents. You may have been too afraid to do it for yourself but now you have a child to protect.
