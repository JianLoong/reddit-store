So....?", "This brings up memories of when a relative decided to take the new toy my family got for me because according to him I was too old to play with toys but his daughter was just the right age.", "this would've been the perfect time to pivot to \"maybe you and mom can go get some craft supplies!\" and put that on her. clearly the little one likes painting and shit, so. time to do that at home.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nas a mom, thank you for giving her one and, i'm assuming, letting her pick it out. maybe mom needs to remember who Mom is and step in to entertain HER child.", "I\u2019m gonna say it. Did the fact that Riley got combative get in the way of you being like hey, this was fun, I\u2019ll keep them safe til next time; or, is there a special one I should keep for you? Or here, you hold onto this one for next time\n?? \n\nIt sounds like Riley got combative in front of the kid and your answer was to remind her you didn\u2019t have to leave anything. \n\nThat\u2019s not all on you but 2 adults engaged\u2026weirdly in front of a kid who was age-appropriately disappointed\u2026.because she likely had plans for at least 1 other figurine. \n\nYou aren\u2019t the AH. But you both could have done better here.", "Exactly. If she\u2019s six, she\u2019s in school. Does she try take classroom materials home, too?", "My kid kits were all stocked from dollar or five below stores. Well-raised and imaginative kids don\u2019t care about the cost of things, they can have fun with whatever. And if they broke it by accident\u2026 no harm, no foul! \n\nIt\u2019s so entitled of Riley to want the tools of OP\u2019s trade.", "Not only that fuck up but now she no longer has a free babysitter... Or she'll call you as soon as she needs you then you can help her learn how not to FAFO.", "For me it was at least partly- I can\u2019t talk when I\u2019m trying not to cry. Like if I open my mouth to let words out so will the crying. And when someone swarmed over asking \u201comg are you okay poor baby\u201d I couldn\u2019t tell them I was fine without starting to cry and I\u2019d try to because they seemed to expect a response but then I\u2019d be crying and also the stress from handling the adult\u2019s reaction and then they\u2019d assume it wasn\u2019t fine\u2026 adults pls do not do this thx", "We moved more than 1,000 miles away from my hometown when I was 10. At that point, I didn\u2019t need a sitter anymore unless it was an overnight, but I\u2019m now in my 30s and I still remember my favorite sitter. Melissa was amazing and I adored her.", "Yes, I\u2019d say it was the 9 figurines that disappeared that really caused the issue.", "Yes!  The appropriate reaction is, \"Ella likes art projects, I should buy her supplies.\"  Not, \"You should give your business products to us for free since Ella wants to play arts & crafts\"!?!", "4 years ago, my daughter with liquid foundation all over the cabinets and wall of my bathroom. Don't get me wrong, the stick figures were cute but I wear a heavy duty foundation, that s*** was difficult to get off.", "1986 for me. It was mascara and foundation just low enough for my grubby hands to get on them. It wasn't a wall either more like my mom's white blouse. Yeah, she learned the hard way.", "One visit to grandma at about 8 years I\u2019d gotten the makeup head Barbie. Left alone, I decided the wall was a better canvas for my self-expression than the plastic head\n\nGrandma locked me in the bathroom all afternoon. Gave me a lot of insight into how Mom ended up like that", "In the early days of the internet i spent a lot of time on whymysoniscrying.com and it was illuminating haha", "Yes! Straight up I\u2019ve seen kids take extremely nasty falls, tear up and then get distracted by a playmate running past and immediately forget their injuries to run off after them. \n\nI\u2019ve also seen kids literally cry over absolutely nothing. Have you seen those tweets where people are like \u201creasons my kid cried this week?\u201d They\u2019re is always like \u201cthey didn\u2019t want me to leave her behind but we literally weren\u2019t going anywhere\u201d or \u201cI gave them the exact thing they asked for.\u201d To be fair when you have such little practice with emotional regulation and have no life experience to compare this disappointment against, each thing is going to feel like a big disaster. But it\u2019s up to their parents to model how to handle those feelings. \n\nIn this case it was up to mom to explain that this was an activity she gets to do when auntie OP comes over, that\u2019s what makes it special. These are not her supplies to keep, but maybe (*maybe*) they can do another one the next time she babysits. (But also maybe not, they might not always bring it over and that\u2019s okay. There will be other fun things to do when she comes over!)", "Jesus, this is embarrassing.", "Liar you can still see it in your comments honey go get a life its all there just under this one. Didn't you know it still shows on your comments?? Oh and stop abusing the reddit help that's just disgusting of you. When you get into a debate you delete the comment calling me names and abuse the reddit help button. Bless your heart. Silly girl."]}
