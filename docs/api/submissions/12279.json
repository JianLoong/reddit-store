She and her husband \u201cJoe\u201d (34M) haven\u2019t been able to get the childcare situation totally sorted out and needed a babysitter last Saturday, so I agreed to watch Ella for the day while Riley was at work. \n\nI've been sort of the \"cool aunt\" ever since Ella was born.

Ella is a smart and engaged kid and I like to give her things that will interest her and keep her occupied.\n\nOne important piece of information here is that I'm a very crafty person. I have a small online store and also work with local businesses for selling and distributing small batches of my product - hand painted wooden figurines.

She doesn't have melt downs about it, because we've talked about these are things auntie will share when she's older. It's about communication & establishing boundaries. I've been doing age appropriate art/craft things with her since she was a toddler & we've never had an issue.

Does Riley start dismantling the swings when she leaves the playground?", "NTA, mom should have explained to her why she can\u2019t have them all rather than confronting you about it in front of her.

This is why people need to tell their kids no more often.", "NTA, but I'm a sucker for kids and probably would have maybe said \"these are my special paints ella, next time I'll bring some you can keep!\" And given her some cheap paints or old ones, ones you no longer use or something.
