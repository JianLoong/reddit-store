It was an amicable split, and we have gotten on a lot better as friends than as a couple. That isn't the issue. \nSo we were getting a house organised for her to live, getting it cleaned/painted/furnished etc, and by mid July we were ready to start to tell my parents and the kids. \nSo 14th July, I met with my parents and explained everything, and theyr were the first to know. Next, once kids came home from a trip, we told them around 19th July.\nGiving them all a couple weeks to get used to it, I then met up with my closest friend who I've known for almost 40 yrs to tell him and talk things through (I'd had a few other issues this year too, including some mental health). Another friend was there that heard parts of it, so I explained to him also. \nThis 2nd friends wife, is the sister of my brother(52)'s wife (50). He goes home to tell her, and she is straight on to her sister to tell her (2 biggest gossips I've ever met)\nSo what does my SIL do. Writes a long 5 text message to MY MUM (who is 86) about how upset she was that they weren't informed about the split, how annoyed that my mum hadn't told her. Tearing in to her and criticising pretty much everything about me. She actually said how they had sat around as a family, and discussed how many ways THEY would be embarrassed and humiliated in front of their friends, had they bumped into my wife and kids, and not knowing. How they were entitled to have been told. \nQuote from her message :\n\"xxxx told xxxx minutes after she heard. Minutes ! I could sit politely and say nothing if it was only me had been in the dark or risked seeing them and being made to look stupid but that could have been extremely humiliating for my husband and my kids. A simple text would have been courteous. We keep you informed of everything. Every appointment, every achievement. Never speaking out of turn but it wasn't my sister's place to tell xxxx. Thank God they didn't bump into them. Don't know how they would have managed.\"\n\nSo I replied saying how annoyed I was that she had attacked my mum like that when I had asked my mum not to say anything to anyone. I questioned all the things that she attacked me personally. She didn't reply. Her sister however started attacking at me for sending \"nasty messages\" to her sister\nMy mum and dad backed me completely , and still do. I am being cursed and made the bad guy with her family. \nMy brother to this day backs his wife, and has not been in touch with our parents. My dad is extremely annoyed, and my mum is trying to keep do what's best for them to get to see their grandkids\nWe are all due to go to my brother's house as usual on boxing day. I refuse to go until she apologises to my mum, which she won't.

I do feel bad for my brother, and did speak to him separately, and did say I was sorry he found out from her sister before I told him.
