So, a bit of a backstory is that I (27F) really do not like sharing my own space. I was always annoyed having to live with my siblings when I was younger and roommates when I went to college. Just something about being interrupted or needing to share communal areas bothered me. I was just never very comfortable living with others. I finally felt a lot better when I got my own condo and lived alone, no messes to clean or laundry from others. Mind you, I fully realize this is not normal at all for most people and that I am really weird for this preference but it works for me.\n\nOnto the actual thing. I have been seeing my bf for 3 years, he lives just a block away and we got engaged 2 weeks ago. He understands how I feel about shared spaces and for that, he has never pressured me into moving with him, but now it's come up again in planning and he thought that things would change when we got married. He was wondering about who should move into the other person's house or if we should look at a new house together but I told him I'm not leaving or sharing my condo anytime soon and he and my parents looked at me like I just grew another head. We've had a lot of arguments about this and the other day he told me he has no idea why I even said yes if I had no intention of living with him and wished I didn't waste his time which really hurt me. I know it's not exactly normal but we are within walking distance and see each other all the time, It's not like we really NEED to live together when we can pop into our houses whenever we want to. We can't be the only couple with an arrangement like this, right?

Right now, your story sounds like you didn\u2019t. If you did make it really clear and he didn\u2019t choose to believe you, then NTA. \n\nHave you discussed finances? Children? Anything else that actually matters? You need to asap.", "INFO- Do you want to marry him? Or, did you accept his proposal because you were afraid the relationship was over if you didn\u2019t say \u201cyes\u201d?", "I'm going to say YTA for (a) not making that clear when you got engaged, and (b) how you said it.  If you want to live separate from your husband *and he is okay with that*, it would not make you TA to do so.  But you had to know that most people would have the expectation of living with their spouse, so to get engaged without addressing the future living situation makes YTA.\n\nI would also suggest that there are compromises to be found.  For instance you could look at condos next to each other and connect them, so that you have your own space, but your husband still feels like you're living together.  Talk and see if there is a living situation that will make you both happy.", "I mean, while I think this is very odd, I can\u2019t judge you for having this be your preferred living arrangement. To each their own. \n\nBut I sure as hell will for your inability to makes this CRYSTAL clear before you got engaged, because everyone\u2019s reaction to you proves you didn\u2019t. At least 90% of couples are going to want to move in together at some point, so when you have a preference that you are well aware is the minority, it is your responsibility when entering a relationship to make it very, VERY clear to the other party that you DON\u2019T want that so this exact situation does not happen. And also keep in mind that you are probably going to have a difficult time finding someone who is 100% okay with this. \n\nYou want your own space as much as he wants to live with you. The way I see it, you guys can\u2019t stay together unless you work out some sort of compromise or one of you caves. I\u2019d learn from this, take the L and return the ring.\n\nEdit: forgot to actually type YTA", "YTA\n\nLiving with a romantic partner is completely different to siblings as a child or random college room mates, have you ever even tried it? This is something you should\u2019ve discussed at the start of your relationship, definitely way before getting engaged. Do you not stay over at each other\u2019s places now? What about going on holiday?? What about kids? I\u2019m not sure how you have a long term relationship when you are so adverse to sharing your space. Maybe you should try therapy", "YTA. If this was always your stance when getting married, it most definitely should\u2019ve been communicated at the beginning of your engagement and very clearly. This sounds like a deal breaker for him. Marriage is a partnership and full of compromises. And the way you said it was like you *assumed* he knew this already, which it doesn\u2019t like he did! That miscommunication is on you, not him. This arrangement is obviously not normal for most married couples and your fianc\u00e9 is not on board with living separately from his wife. I think IF this engagement proceeds, you two should get some couples counseling before even setting a date.", "Yeahhhhh YTA. His assumption that you would want to live together eventually is completely valid. I think this is everyone\u2019s assumption when you get engaged / married. If your plan is to live alone forever, I\u2019m gonna go out on a limb and say it will be very hard for you to find someone to marry. If I\u2019m that guy, I\u2019m getting out asap", "Info: did you both talk about living arrangements beforehand? It\u2019s very unique to be married and living in separate houses. What does marriage look like to you, if you don\u2019t want to share housing?", "As someone who also enjoys her own space, and would have been very happy having separate but relatively close homes, I get your perspective. I may not be quite as dedicated to it, as I do eventually accept living with someone. But I do so prefer separate spaces. I'm still split on this. \n\nINFO: before getting engaged, did either of you talk about living situations long-term? They are big conversations that need to be had and that's definitely one of them given how out of the social norm your preference is. If in three years you've never made this clear, then I have to go with Y T A. If you did talk about it and he didn't hear you or didn't believe you, then N A H.\n\nedit: typo", "Yeah, YTA\n\nLook I hate people being in my space and do not tolerate house guests BUT your SO is the exception.\n\nI'm not going to call you weird because at a certain level I understand, but you shouldn't be getting married if you can't stand the thoughts of living together.", "Before and after the engagement, did you two ever talk about living arrangements?  I suspect you assumed nothing would change, and he assumed everything would change, and none of you confirmed that with each other.  I also assume that he already knew how important it is for you that you live separately.  \n\nMinority voice here, but I think ESH.  Both of you should have confirmed with each other.  I also think this relationship is over, or will be.  You both have to be comfortable with the separate homes.  Don't force yourself into sharing, I think you'll be miserable.  \n\nQuestions for the future:  How much personal space do you need?  Would it work for you to have your own basement \"apartment\" in a house you both share?  Do you plan to have kids?  What happens when you do?", "I don\u2019t think YTA for wanting an unconventional living arrangement, but for the what can only be a lack of communication on how you perceived married life. Clearly this took your BF by surprise.", "YTA you should have made that hella clear way earlier. Helena bohnam carter and Tim burton and Amanda Palmer and Neil gaiman both lived this way as couples and they\u2019re divorced.", "YTA If you seriously never expected to live with him you had the obligation to make that SUPER clear before you accepted his proposal and spent all this time dating/engaged. It's really not OK to say you really want to marry him but are totally unwilling to deal with anything that may inconvenience you.", "YTA you two should\u2019ve discussed this prior to getting engaged. Clear communication is key!! It doesn\u2019t sound like you two are compatible and somebody is going to end up miserable. End the relationship and find someone that wants what you want.", "I'm leaning towards YTA. I hate saying that. Most married couples want to live together, and even if he's been supportive of you living separate, he probably had that intention of moving in together after marriage. I understand wanting your own space, but I think you should at least try living together- especially if you're planning on getting married. If it doesn't work, you'll gain more perspective. Part of being married is making sacrifices for each other. \n\nOn a side note, I think more married couples these days take several weeks throughout the year to have that alone time in a different place. Or they even sleep in different beds. There's ways you can still keep that independence. But if you love him and want to be with him forever, I think you should try living together and experiencing it before you decide it's not for you. And if you care about him, you should compromise on those choices together.", "Why do you want to get married if everything is going to stay the same? What would be the point?\n\nYTA", "YTA.  It sounds like you did not clearly communicate that you had no intention of changing your lifestyle for him.  People generally think of marriage as a joining of lives, assets, and families. To refuse to share a living space with your spouse is certainly not the norm, so all the more important to have clearly communicated this before accepting a marriage proposal.  I\u2019m not sure if you both have ever discussed whether you want children, but certainly refusing to live together would also fundamentally alter home life for any children as well.", "Please have a very clear and frank conversation about your goals and plans in life. People make a lot of assumptions about marriage, and what it means. You don't have to do anything you don't want to do, but the two of you should calmly and seriously talk about all of this.", "I came here ready to defend you. I came here intending to say no one should force you to share space. But I just can't.\n\nYTA \n\nIn situations where you are going against the norm, you need to be *super clear* as early as possible what your boundaries are. Are there married couples that don't live together? Absolutely. But they talked about it and came to an arrangement that worked for them. Your relationship won't work if you don't communicate. If you do not intend to live with someone and they can't fathom living life like that, then you aren't compatible. You should have made your intentions clear as soon as things started to get serious.\n\nAlso, if you haven't discussed this, what else haven't y'all discussed? Do you know how you'll treat money in your relationship? Do you know if y'all want kids. And if you do and don't live together how that will work? None of this sounds fully thought through.", "Well, only YTA because you didn't communicate earlier. It sounds like you're crystal clear about wanting to live alone and that you didn't spell that out for him earlier in the relationship. You'll be able to find partners willing to permanently live separately but you'll need to be explicit about that when you date.\n\nIt's worth talking to him about a duplex situation,. including how many nights a week you'd like to sleep together. It may or may not work for both of you but it's great for some couples.", "YTA", "YTA, you shouldve made this clear long ago. Are you planning on having kids? Are you planning to leave them at his house and just go home? You're meant to be a team, so you just plan to have double expenses forever? Beyond all of that, living with strangers/friends/siblings is so different to living with a partner. Maybe you should start slow and start having him stay for a week, then two.\n\nTo be perfectly honest, most people who want a partner, want to live with their partner. I'm not saying its everyone, but I suspect you would have trouble finding someone who wants things this way. \n\nWhy dont you make a safe space, so a room that if you're in there he will not enter, not knock unless it's an emergency and you can just have your space?", "YTA", "YTA- When the relationship started to become more serious you should have sat your \"fiance?\" Down and explained how even after marriage you wanted to live separately. \n\n\n\nI needing your own space but, for me I couldn't imagine not living with my husband.

If you weren\u2019t clear on that before saying yes you were completely unfair", "NTA but most married couples live in the same house. You are no longer single and you no longer belong to yourself. You should decide if you\u2019re ready for marriage. Which means sharing everything of value with someone. It\u2019s emotional and business.", "If you wanna be single/dont like them that much just say that wtf kinda weird shit is that", "YTA and it sounds like you need therapy", "YTA, your boyfriend is right, why did you waste his time?, you could have let him know at any point over the 3 years that you were dating that you did not intend to merge lives .

Maybe that would work for you two?", "YTA. I can't fathom how you can even think about marrying him when you don't want to compromise or share your life with him.

However it sounds like the communication has been nonexistent between the two of you on this subject which isn\u2019t sensible or mature. It makes me wonder what other important matters you haven\u2019t discussed.", "NAH. You need to face reality and realize you may not be compatible with your boyfriend. You don't like sharing spaces and that's an issue in a relationship that lasts a long time. You do owe it to your boyfriend to tell him and not string him along.", "NAH. It's completely valid for you to prefer living alone and your boyfriend should respect your feelings about it. However, it's also understandable that he wants to live together after getting married. You both have different preferences and it's important to have a mature conversation about it. Living separately can work if it makes both of you happy, but it's important to consider the practical aspects and make sure you're both on the same page.", "YTA. You shouldn\u2019t get married. You don\u2019t deserve a \u201csupposed\u201d loved one that you can\u2019t stand to be in your presence.

That's your thought process on not wanting to live with your married partner?!?

He was looking forward to *sharing* a life with you, a home with you. I sincerely doubt you were unaware of this expectation. Make no mistake, you are worthy of love and deserve to get married, however, your partner deserves someone who shares the same values. Your partner deserves someone who is unafraid to communicate openly. Your partner deserves someone who deems him worthy of their honesty. \n\nCan you honestly say you met your partner half way in this instance?\n\nMarriage is about compromise and you are being wholeheartedly unyielding. Your partner might have even been willing to compromise with you, but you made a unilateral decision for the pair of you. Either cut this man loose so he can find someone who is willing to actually build and share a life, or pull your head out of your ass and communicate with him. \n\nSometimes separate beds make for a happy marriage, but a happy marriage takes trust and communication - you have given him neither. Do better.", "ESH\n\nRight now you two should not get married - your communication sucks and seems like you're not compatible with the way you want to live as a married couple. Both of you made assumptions and made a massive commitment without actually discussing the realities of your future together.

I'm torn on the AH part.  I would suggest that if this is the only way you can live, but you still want to be in a partnership, then maybe the two of you should buy a Duplex together.  You can each have your own places, but be right there for one another, two.  This is far different I realize, but some couples can't sleep together due to snoring or chronic pain issues, who sleep in their own bedrooms, but are still very much together and in love.   But, it has to work for both parties.", "I just wanna say - you have every right to keep a separate living space, married or not. I agree with others that you could\u2019ve made this more clear, since marriage tends to mean co-habitation (just look at all the commenters who can\u2019t even IMAGINE it another way). But wanting a your own place is valid and doesn\u2019t say anything about the value if your relationship, your love, etc. \n\nI\u2019ve always wanted next door apartments myself, with a hole in the adjourning wall for the cats to travel freely.

Erm kids yes no live in a house together bloomin ridiculous", "YTA for not clarifying this to him. Essentially the message you\u2019re giving him is that he isn\u2019t important enough to you in order for you to compromise. That you will continue to value yourself above your marriage and have an un-agreeable personality which isn\u2019t compatible with a healthy marriage. Part of the appeal of coinhabiting is reduced expenses, he most likely doesn\u2019t imagine a life where he has separate expenses from his wife and is missing out on a lot of the main perks of marriage. Such as companionship. You\u2019re also TA for not even being willing to give it a test run. Tbh you sound too self absorbed for marriage and if you actually love and care about him you will encourage him to find a more compatible partner if you\u2019re not willing to compromise. The only marriages in which living separately are appropriate or normal is if it\u2019s later in life post the reproductive years because living separately won\u2019t work for raising children. I saw your comments about not being able to have children, be aware that it\u2019s still a possibility unless you\u2019re missing reproductive organs, etc. I would say that 30% of my friends with children were told they could never have them. Seeing as you don\u2019t believe you can you\u2019re probably not taking steps to prevent pregnancy so don\u2019t discount the possibility of children.", "100% this!  You should have made this clear from the start that you had no intentions of cohabiting even if you were to get married. It seems, by both your parents  and fianc\u00e9s reactions that they were unaware of this unconventional living arrangement.  \n\nHaving two different residences is expensive! Marriage is a partnership with compromise from both parties.  Maybe you two should try couples counseling to learn to communicate better and decide on the future if this relationship.

What benefit is there to\nMarrying?", "I'm going to say your odds are looking pretty slim. 50-50 at best.", "Why? What would marriage add to your arrangement?", "I feel like you were seriously in denial here. Yes, he was always understanding about you not wanting to live together. But come on, you *had to know* \\-- on some level, even if you didn't let yourself \"know\" it -- that he might assume you would of course move in together once you're married. And deep down, you were afraid of the conversation that would happen once you made it clear that you didn't ever want to move in together.\n\nBecause sometimes there are incompatibilities that a couple just can't surpass, no matter how much they love each other, and a part of you was afraid this was one of them. So you kept your head stuck in the sand just hoping that you'd never have to face it if you didn't talk about it. \n\nYes, it's highly unusual for married couples to not live together.

I have a bunch of issues because of my autism and mental health problems that mean I don\u2019t get on well with having people around me a lot of the time, but I love my wife to the ends of this earth and I hate being away from her and our sons. They\u2019re a part of me. I need space from anyone and everyone but them. We have had time apart on a number of occasions and, when I became ill and was paralysed, I had to sleep separately from my wife for 5 or so years. We\u2019d spend the odd night together, but very rarely. I hated it. Yet, if I\u2019m around anyone else for any length of time\u2026 yeah. I just can\u2019t be. I have to find a corner of a room and put my headphones on to block everything out. \nThat\u2019s what I mean: have you tried living with your partner for maybe a month or so? Just to see how it works? \n\nI really hope you manage to resolve things in a way that you are genuinely happy, and that your fianc\u00e9e gets to be, too. I can imagine that this has been quite the blow for them, and that has been a shock to you too, because you assumed they knew. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve all had to go through that. \n\nPlease consider and talk about all your options. I totally respect you and your wants in life, as should whomever you are with, too. But you have to be abundantly clear on your wants and needs. \n\nI don\u2019t like putting it, tbf. But, YTA. I hope that changes, in all honesty.

You say you really want to marry him, but are being very inflexible with your stance on this issue. I estimate only around 1 or 2% of the world population would be ok with a living arrangement such as you'd prefer. So your options are 1. Accept that this is a deal breaker and break up with your partner or 2. Attempt a compromise.  If you retain your condo, why not attempt a trial run of moving into his place? Try living with him, and see if his routines and standards of cleanliness are agreeable to you. You may be pleasantly surprised at how he maintains his home and respects your need for personal space. I say this as someone who, much like you, absolutely HATES living with roommates. As in, I'd rather be homeless than live with a roommate or siblings again. Even close friends, absolutely hated it. EXCEPT my partner. My partner is the ONE other person on this planet that I can share a residence with.....something that I'd previously suspected I'd have significant issues with. And without trying it out, I'd never have realized this. \n\n\nIf you cannot bring yourself to compromise on this issue, you may need to take a look at yourself and really think about whether you're in a place to consider marriage. 90% of a successful marriage is an ability to communicate and compromise.  You already dropped the ball by failing, in THREE YEARS, to communicate that you do not ever see yourself cohabitating with your partner. Your partner has already compromised by waiting to cohabitate til marriage, and by offering multiple options on which residence to live in after marriage.  It is your turn to offer up an agreeable compromise (as in, meet him halfway, not force him into your desired arrangement)......or break up with him so he can find a partner who is emotionally and mentally ready to enter a partnership.  Don't waste more of his time. He deserved to know this upfront, not 3 years and an engagement ring later.
