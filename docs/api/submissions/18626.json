I'm just angry and confused so please excuse all the grammar mistakes and whatnot. \n\nMy (20F) sister (27F) has a 3 year old. Recently, she posted a tiktok of my niece in the pool since it's summer and the pools are open. She's always posting my niece on tiktok and i never thought of it as a problem because her account was private with maybe 10 followers, all of whom are family. I noticed with this tiktok that it had more likes than normal, so i checked her account and it was public. Anyway, this tiktok of my niece in the pool got 30 saves too. It creeped me out and I texted her to tell her that she should take the video down or at least go back private because the internet is full of creeps and it is very creepy to see the 30 saves when she doesn't even have 30 followers. She got mad and claimed i was jealous that her kid was going viral and that I was sick in the head for even thinking like that about my own niece. After that she blocked me on all social media and is refusing to talk to me because i'm \"sexualizing my niece\". This was not my intention at all. I love my niece so much and I truly care for her. I told our mom about the situation and my mom thinks I should just mind my own business because im not my nieces mom. But I am her auntie ?? Is it wrong for me to be concerned? AITA??\n\nEDIT: I just noticed the title says Friend. that was a mistake. I typed this post in a hurry and didn't even re-read the post before posting. Hence the grammar mistakes and everything.

She thinks it has so many saves because she is so cute?", "NTA Your sister is an idiot, risking her daughter\u2019s safety for likes. Who tf does she think saves tiktoks of kids they don\u2019t even know?", "NTA assuming all you did was tell her about your concern.  Unless you were being really pushy, blocking you seems extreme. Thirty people saving a video of a child in a swimsuit is creepy as hell, and these y t a votes saying your family isn't your business are just wild.", "Why would she think you're jealous that her kids going viral? NTA, likes aren't everything.", "NTA if you expressed concern. It is a fact that perverts troll social media for kid content.", "NTA. Hell NO. My child wasn\u2019t allowed to have a photo online until he turned 18. 3 minutes to find a full name, address, place of work/school. In 1995. On DIAL UP. Takes less time now.", "NTA. \n\nYour sister wants to \"go viral\" so bad, she doesn't realize she's jeopardizing the kid's safety. \n\nThe fact that she blocked you on all social media might mean she's considering making more public tiktoks of your niece and doesn't want to deal with you. \n\nThe problem is, a simple distraction while filming might allow inclusion of details regarding name and location. I think she just believes \"that kind of things won't happen to them\".", "NTA - Unless your 3yo niece was performing advanced diving techniques off the 50 meter high dive, there is no reason EXCEPT creepy reasons for random people to be saving that video.", "Nta I think you brought a very valid point to your sister that her arrogance/ignorance is getting in the way of her understanding. Unfortunately, it is her call. But reminding your sister that creeps exist was not out of line, nor was it  \"sexualizing\" her daughter.", "NTA for voicing your concerns. But at the end of the day, that's her child, and as long as she's not abused or neglected, stay out of it.", "NTA but I agree with mom.", "NTA. You warned her. You tried to show her. Not a fan of running to mothers and drag them to the situation, but your concerns are valid. You did what you could. Unfortunately, it is her call. Trying to push more after she blocked you would make you go into A H territory.", "If you raised the concern once in a kind and gentle way - like 'Hey, don't know if you've thought about this but creepy people could be saving this for nefarious reasons. Maybe go back to private? Or at least don't share pool pics' - then NTA.\n\nIf you kept repeatedly pushing the point, YTA. You're not your niece's parent, and different parents have different levels of comfort around sharing photos of their kid online. Unless your sister is being incredibly reckless (posting naked photos of her child in the bath or whatever), then there's no right or wrong answer and it's not your call because it's not your kid.", "You didn't go about this very well. You can express concerns, and it would have been reasonable to say something like \"I worry about niece when her videos are posted publicly because of what I hear/ read/ know about predators online.\" You strayed out of your lane when you asked/ told her that she needed to change her parenting. Not only was that rude, but it's also counterproductive, as demonstrated by her reaction of digging in further. YTA.", "Leaning towards YTA. Raising a concern is totally fine, but your sister also has the right to disagree. Her reaction and some of your comments imply that you were persistent and pushy on this, which is putting you in AH territory.", "NTA at all! Thank you for standing up for your niece when her mom clearly has blinders on.", "YTA. I honestly don't even think this is real.", "[deleted]", "the most you can do is talk to the kid's father.\n\nAnd then hope no-one tries to snatch the child or worse. You can go full scorched earth and explicitly detail what people do to kids, show her a documentary or two. \n\nbut she sounds like she doesn't get upvotes for her own pics, so she's using her child for the clout. scary stuff. Keep an eye out for the kiddo.", "YTA. Not your child, not your call, whether you have valid concerns or not.", "YTA and being an alarmist. In the end it's up to each parent to make that decision about their own kid. You mentioned it and should have let it go at that point. You should never give parenting advice based on things you found online because it's really subjective.", "[deleted]", "NTA, good of you to try and protect the poor girl from her clueless mom.  I'm sorry you've done all you can at this point.", "NTA - Her being okay with her 3 year old child going \"viral\" on a mature app is a pretty big red flag.\n\nYou're not the AH. You're trying to protect your neice, and everyone else is ignoring just how dangerous the world really is.", "I used to work in the child protection space around trafficking and online abuse.\n\n100% those saves are what you think they are. It's not safe to post stuff like that. None of my colleagues in that sector posted pics of their kids online because they knew. \n\nYou're right, but there's not much you can do if she's got her fingers in her ears. \n\nNTA.", "YTA for telling and not suggesting.  It sounds like you basically told her what to do instead of just giving advice.", "I get where you're coming from but YTA.\n\nMind your own business.", "YTA not your kid", "Your sister is delusional if she thinks 30 is \"going viral.\"\n\nAlso, YTA. You stated your concern, but it is her kid, not yours. She gets the final say. You need to drop it", "Honestly I agree posting your kids is on tictok is silly. I personally have never used the app but my wife does and definitely posts our children on there. I think YTA but only softly. There was definitely a better way to handle the situation. As the old saying goes\u2026.you catch more flys with honey. Next time a situation such as this arises try calmly talking about the risks involved but ultimately decisions about somebody else\u2019s child are solely that if there care giver.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
