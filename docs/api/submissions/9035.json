The original money should have been earning interest all this time, and however more years it takes for you to get restitution (it won't be soon). Your legal expenses also have to be paid out of that triple damages. 30-50% to the lawyer is standard. In the end, even if your father pays out everything the court awards you on paper, you'll be lucky if you wind up with a net roughly equal to what you would have had by then anyway if he'd been honest.

Your father made selfish choices which made a whole lot of consequences inevitable for him and for you. I'm sorry. I hope you come to realize how deeply he has wronged you.
