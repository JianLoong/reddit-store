The original money should have been earning interest all this time, and however more years it takes for you to get restitution (it won't be soon). Your legal expenses also have to be paid out of that triple damages. 30-50% to the lawyer is standard. In the end, even if your father pays out everything the court awards you on paper, you'll be lucky if you wind up with a net roughly equal to what you would have had by then anyway if he'd been honest.

Believe me, you're not gonna feel like you profited off of what he did, you're gonna be lucky if you feel made somewhat whole. Your father made selfish choices which made a whole lot of consequences inevitable for him and for you. I'm sorry. I hope you come to realize how deeply he has wronged you.

The actual story is that they'd been serving extremely hot beverages that caused **third degree burns**. They even [made a documentary about it \\(and several other cases\\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Coffee_\\(film\\)):\n\n> This segment features interviews with Liebeck's family and focuses on their perspective of the trial. This included news clips, comments from celebrities and politicians about the case, as well as **myths and misconceptions, including how many people thought she was driving when the incident occurred and thought that she suffered only minor superficial burns, while in truth she suffered severe burns and needed extensive surgeries.** The concept of accountability is also discussed. The film also discussed in great depth how Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants is often used and misused to describe a frivolous lawsuit and referenced in conjunction with tort reform efforts.[2] It argued that corporations have spent millions distorting certain tort cases in order to promote tort reform."]}
