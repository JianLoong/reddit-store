A woman can choose to be and do whatever she wants, and it's gross to assume every housewife is illiterate or has no accolades. You are 100% correct that you don't owe her your CV or backup in a fight she didn't need to having in front of you anyway.", ">She said something to BIL about how he\u2019s backward and misogynistic but she\u2019s not surprised since the only women in the family are poor little housewives who were never allowed to read.\n\nShe said that to her husband in front of her in-laws?  Wow.  Just rude.  \n\nNo, you don't need to disclose your degrees or education level to everyone you meet.  Especially not to someone who is weaponizing her education level and actively attacking you for your life choices. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Feminism and equality is deciding *together with your partner* that you staying home is the best move for your family. \n\nFor all her education, she seemingly doesn't know what misogyny or misandry is. She ought to go back to school.", "Nta.  I was a sahm for 10+ years.  You\u2019ll get attitude like this a lot from people who think it\u2019s a waste to stay home and raise kids.  I just recently reentered the work force with no problems.  I do not regret my time as a sahm.  Nobody ever looks back and wishes they spent less time with their kids.  You don\u2019t owe Sarah an explanation for your decision and I would not engage her or anyone else and just tell them it\u2019s none of their business.", "NTA why would you have to disclose your education to your SIL? You didn't interview to work for her. Any you're a traitor for doing what makes you happy? What? The looking down on your MIL is making her even worse.\n\nYour BIL is not an idiot for disclosing your education in order to defend you from her snobby comments though you shouldn't have been pulled into their argument (and neither should your MIL) Idk if he's an misogynist but even if he is that isn't too blame on MIL and it was extremely rude of her to drag other family members into this. Obviously her education didn't help her to think logical or show a slight bit of intelligence. She just proofed that education doesn't necessarily prevent a closed mind.", "NTA you do you! It\u2019s your choice to keep your education to yourself. Why would you bring it up out of context? Also some people wanna be moms and that\u2019s their full time job. Tell her to suck it. Feminism is about equality not insulting women who choose to be sahm. My mum was one and I better not catch anyone insulting her.", "NTA. You do what you want. Sarah is pathetic, and so full of herself", "NTA \n\nIt is such an insanely misogynistic take to put no value on the work that women did for centuries or to say that women who do that work now are \u201ctraitors\u201d. Gross. She\u2019s got some internalized issues to work through. I thought the beauty of feminism was that women are free to do whatever valuable work they choose, not that they are only valuable if they choose to do something different than they traditionally did.", "NTA. And what loser from a highly ranked university mocks people for not completing their secondary education? Indeed degrees don't spare people from being idiots. Good luck with her..funny thing is that she wants to feel superior no matter what..before she knew your credentials you were less than her for not being as educated..when she knew your credentials and the fact that you're more educated than her she immediately thought of how she's better by telling you that you've wasted your life. With people like that you can never win. What a miserable person.", "NTA, you don't need to tell your SIL your work/education history. Seems her finding out just caused you more stress is why you choose to be a SAHM in the first place. Hang in there, hopefully she will back off. SAHM is misunderstood job, you work hard but you get paid in hugs and kisses, some won't get that is worth more than money.", "Absolutely NTA\n\nYour SIL at her core seems incredibly insecure. Women who are high-achievers who earned their accomplishments seldom feel the need to put down other people's education or life choices. It looks to me like she needs to be able to look down on women who \"aren't as high achieving\" to be able to have any sort of self-esteem and the fact that you are more educated than she is and simply chose to be a SAHM leaves her unable to do so.\n\n\"I\u2019ve also known she looks down on our MIL because she never completed her secondary education\" - does your SIL know what your MIL's financial situation was like? Does she know what your MIL'd personal/family situation was like? To disrespect her simply because she doesn't have a college degree is absolutely disgusting and no truly well-educated person would do that\n\nYou should tell her to stay in her lane and mind her damn business.", "NTA\n\nShe's not entitled to your education or work history and you are allowed to live your life however you see fit for yourself and your family.", "NTA. You're right, you don't have to prove yourself to every single person you meet, family or not. Feminism allows you to make the *choice* of what to do with your life. You made yours (for now, it could change) and that's fine, no one forced you into it. Sarah made her choice to work (again, for now, it could change) and it works for her.", "NTA.

Instead SIL wrote OP off as an illiterate housewife. \n\nNo one gets to dictate that OP is wasting her life. Honestly not sure why BIL would want children with a woman like that.", "NTA and SIL is hung up on the wrong things. We get one life (or more depending)...live it your way. She views life as a hierarchy; who she is above and below. This rigid perspective leads to missing so much. The richness in people does not lie in their degrees; they are remembered for how they treated others or for their kindness especially when it is difficult to offer. Tell her instead of reading your CV volunteer to teach women (people) to read.", "You're NTA. Your BIL better buckle up, it's going to be a turbulent ride. It is none of Sarah's business what degrees you have earned, or what you or any other woman chooses to do with her life.\n\nIt sounds like she married into this family for the sole purpose of feeling superior to everyone around her. The sooner her attitude and habit of putting everyone down is nipped in the bud, the better.", "Misandrist is actually hilarious in this context? Like you're...running some kind of anti man scheme by...being a stay at home mom? But also somehow a Bad Feminist? Shes like the 2 worst sides of the internet got trapped in one person. Sounds uncomfortable. I hope she heals. NTA.", "Sounds like all she has going for her is her education. Certainly not her personality. You have education, time raising your children & you aren\u2019t an arse, so good for you. Enjoy your life & your family.\n\nMy brother looks down on me because I don\u2019t have a degree. Life just didn\u2019t work out that way seeing I wasn\u2019t the golden child. I have been married for almost 30 years with 2 amazingly accomplished children. He\u2019s had 2 failed marriages & sees his children occasionally. He\u2019s ashamed of me (his words) because we aren\u2019t in agreement politically. I never bother to tell him my IQ is much higher than his. \n\nHaters are going to hate. She\u2019s shown her true colours. Sit back & just enjoy your family.", "NTA", "If your SIL posted this, the comments would have been different. \n\nNTA. It is your choice whether to work or not. As long as your husband can support the entire family comfortably you can take on other duties associated with SAHM.", "NTA. \n\nShe embarrassed herself by making assumptions about the people around her. She might have a degree, but she proved herself to be the least educated person in the room. \n\nYou don\u2019t owe her an apology, she owes you and your MiL one.", "NTA. \n\nPart of being a feminist is supporting women who choose to stay at home. Period. \n\nThis is the time to set a firm boundary with a very clear text message and then SIL needs to be in timeout for awhile. \n\nSIL seems very insecure.", "So, her and your BIL are fighting because he wants her to be a SHAM, and she wants to pursue a career after working very hard to get a good degree?", "NTA. She\u2019s egotistical and narcissistic. She wants her views validated. \n\nEveryone is entitled to live they life they choose. You have a kid, and chose to be a SAHM. That\u2019s your prerogative. Simple as that. She can choose to continue her career path, be a mother, shoot, be an exotic dancer with a PhD that she doesn\u2019t use if she so chooses.

Congrats. I'm glad that a chat allowed you to throw your education in the trash. I'm sure that your husband's life is improved by your inability to function in the workforce.
