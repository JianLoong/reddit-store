I just recently reentered the work force with no problems.  I do not regret my time as a sahm.  Nobody ever looks back and wishes they spent less time with their kids.

It\u2019s your choice to keep your education to yourself. Why would you bring it up out of context? Also some people wanna be moms and that\u2019s their full time job. Tell her to suck it.

Good luck with her..funny thing is that she wants to feel superior no matter what..before she knew your credentials you were less than her for not being as educated..when she knew your credentials and the fact that you're more educated than her she immediately thought of how she's better by telling you that you've wasted your life. With people like that you can never win. What a miserable person.", "NTA, you don't need to tell your SIL your work/education history.

Honestly not sure why BIL would want children with a woman like that.", "NTA and SIL is hung up on the wrong things. We get one life (or more depending)...live it your way. She views life as a hierarchy; who she is above and below. This rigid perspective leads to missing so much.

It is none of Sarah's business what degrees you have earned, or what you or any other woman chooses to do with her life.\n\nIt sounds like she married into this family for the sole purpose of feeling superior to everyone around her.

She\u2019s egotistical and narcissistic. She wants her views validated. \n\nEveryone is entitled to live they life they choose. You have a kid, and chose to be a SAHM. That\u2019s your prerogative.

So sometimes it's financially non viable for the father to stay home, even when they WANT to", "I think you would be surprised. That has become a lot more common in the past 20 years. You\u2019ll always get some looks, sure. Boomers gonna be boomers. But a lot of people are like, \u201cCool!\u201d", "You said \u201cnewly married\u201d. I assumed this to mean less than 1 year. If you meant greater than one year, your sign usage is correct but saying newly married and then greater than 1 year adds less clarity than newly married and less than 2 years.", "She\u2019s 23\n\nHonestly I was raised with a similar mentality which led me to push myself to an unhealthy level at work and directly fed into the burnout \n\nI really hate that attitude", "Also how the hell does being a stay at home mom make OP sexist towards men?
