I just recently reentered the work force with no problems.  I do not regret my time as a sahm.  Nobody ever looks back and wishes they spent less time with their kids.  You don\u2019t owe Sarah an explanation for your decision and I would not engage her or anyone else and just tell them it\u2019s none of their business.", "[removed]", "NTA you do you! It\u2019s your choice to keep your education to yourself. Why would you bring it up out of context? Also some people wanna be moms and that\u2019s their full time job. Tell her to suck it.

Good luck with her..funny thing is that she wants to feel superior no matter what..before she knew your credentials you were less than her for not being as educated..when she knew your credentials and the fact that you're more educated than her she immediately thought of how she's better by telling you that you've wasted your life. With people like that you can never win. What a miserable person.", "NTA, you don't need to tell your SIL your work/education history.

You're right, you don't have to prove yourself to every single person you meet, family or not. Feminism allows you to make the *choice* of what to do with your life.

Honestly not sure why BIL would want children with a woman like that.", "NTA and SIL is hung up on the wrong things. We get one life (or more depending)...live it your way. She views life as a hierarchy; who she is above and below. This rigid perspective leads to missing so much.

It is none of Sarah's business what degrees you have earned, or what you or any other woman chooses to do with her life.\n\nIt sounds like she married into this family for the sole purpose of feeling superior to everyone around her.

She\u2019s egotistical and narcissistic. She wants her views validated. \n\nEveryone is entitled to live they life they choose. You have a kid, and chose to be a SAHM. That\u2019s your prerogative.

You can't fix things you don't understand, you can't understand things you can't discuss. \n\nIt's five years ago now but James Damore was asked by his employer for his opinion & insight and offered it respectfully and in good faith. In response the whole country launched a month of hate, the man was fired & left a pariah. \n\nWhat he actually said is *still* hard to find & I think still worthy of a good faith discussion. Even wrong ideas have immense value because debating them helps you refine your own beliefs & get closer to truth.\n\n[https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/3914586/Googles-Ideological-Echo-Chamber.pdf](https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/3914586/Googles-Ideological-Echo-Chamber.pdf)\n\nI kinda wish someone who was on the hate train 5 years back will read the supposed manifesto now & recognize that was not a proud moment for our culture.", "I didn\u2019t mean that part of it.", "you're not wrong. it's incredibly important to have a conversation about where people came by there ideas- on both sides. and for everyone involved in the conversation to be open. and that everyone manage to maintain a level of civility.\n\nwhich is admittedly often the big issue.\n\nparticularly the level of civility. but even just being open to something- acknowledging that your experience isn't the only life experience or only world view.\n\n(to this day, the best and oddest conversation i've had along these lines involved whether or not women were viewed differently by society for being sexual/having sex than men. it was a discussion about revenge porn- which is predominantly focused on women. i was never able to get this guy friend to understand that society views men and women differently when it comes to sex. i'd be fascinated to learn if his position has changed.)\n\nso i think this isn't a flaw of feminism but a flaw of people. we can't blame a set of ideals for the weakness of people.", "Yep\n\nShe if she is civil service, the only way she is demoted / passed up for a job promotion is she robs the place or offs someone and even then, that may not even affect her prospects /s\n\nIgnore the crap out of her mouth, I have met people who look down on you for not having a PhD. Like I give a crap? She is a priggish snob who is showing her own ignorance\n\nNTA"]}
