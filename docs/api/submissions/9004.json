Let them take their wild party somewhere else and be responsible for it themselves.", "NTA\n\nStop feeling guilty. It's your parents' side hustle, their money. Your friends asked, you had totally reasonable answer. Anyone thinking otherwhise has not thought it through.\n\nOne great benefit it going through booking agent etc that there's a paper trail, maybe even insurance and I guess someone's credit card used as guarantee (?) to make sure any damage and cleaning fees are compensated. It's harder to evade those than just party all weekend and expect you to clean up...", "INFO: why are you even talking to these people anymore?", "NTA\nYou don\u2019t owe your friends free stays because you had given it them free in the past\n\nYour gf can give out her family\u2019s vacation for free if she wants but has no business with yours. \n\nDon\u2019t feel bad, they asked you told them what to do. This is not your problem or concern.", "NTA. Your 'friends' are though. I sometimes borrow or use my friends things. Always ask the price. Sometimes they lend it out for free, sometimes they don't.

Your \"friends\" want to use you for a free party house.", "NTA\n\nIs it on AirBNB? Or publically listed somewhere?  Tell your friends that it's now part of your parents income.  If they'd like to book it, they can go to the website to look at the cost and pick the dates, and pay the fees.  \n\nYou get to invite friends to join you at your family vacation home.

It\u2019s come completely normal that they would have to rent the house. If you parents wanted, they could offer a 10% friend if my daughter\u2019s discount but it\u2019s up to them. \nDon\u2019t listen to a word they say.

You have made clear the conditions under which they can go back to the house, it is up to them to decide whether they think it is worth it or not.

You may have been better served though to just say it is a rental property now so it isn\u2019t available (for the types of visits you had previously taken there).

It's all good.", "NTA, it's letting them stay for free is effectively your parents financing their visit, why would they do that?\n\nI have a relative who has a lovely holiday home, the rules for family and friends are simple:\n\n1. You want the house in the busy season you pay. They'll tell the agency they're reserving it for own use, so you pay minus the agency fee \n2. In the low season you can stay for free, as it's unlikely to be rented out anyway\n3. Regardless of when, you have to pay the cost of the professional cleaning company and utilities\n\nNo one has a problem with that, it's their house, it's a source of income, why would they finance my holiday?", "This isn't even your property. Your girlfriend is being an asshole trying to tell you that you have to give people free reign to someone else's property because she would. NTA.", "NTA- If they want to stay then they have to pay.", "NTA this is exactly why your parents need to hire a management company to handle the rentals. The owners (parents) can block off weeks they would like to use the house and not offer for rent and then the management company handles the rest from there. That prevents a grandchild from crashing the place or saying grandma said it was ok, etc. the management company will collect rent and cleaning fee upfront and if your friends trash the place, the money doesn\u2019t involve you", "NTA.\n\nThese so-called friends of yours sound entitled and petty, accusing and name-calling whenever they don't get their way.\n\nCount yourself lucky they decided not to go through with it. They would be trouble, most likely.", "NTA.\n\nOnce upon a time, you and these friends had shared interests. You're no longer into the drinking and smoking parties that they enjoy. So they can't expect you to subsidize the cost of them partying.\n\nAt this point, business is business. They can either pay to rent your parents' vacation house or pay to rent from someone else.\n\nPeople naturally see little or no value in something they get for free. If you were to let them stay for free, they would probably leave the house in much worse condition than strangers who rent it from you do. By asking them to reserve the house and pay for it just like anyone else would, you are doing the right thing for your parents.", "NTA. I know some people who own vacation houses and they all charge their relatives and friends too. Some have discounts, others don't.

If so, you could offer a small discount due to your friendship as a token gesture. But if they don't, then they were never planning on doing this legit, and were just planning on having you fall into old habits and plan things for them to party. \n\nI used to have similar habits to you. Once I stopped planning for friends, they stopped my friends. Good riddance to them.", "Your GF is dumb. NTA.", "Sounds like your friends want free services from a business that belongs to your parents. \n\nWhy would you give something away from a business you don't own. Hell, why would you do it from one you even do?\n\nNTA", "NTA. When you took them for free you were living with your parents. Circumstances have changed and it's rented out when family isn't using it.\n\nTell gf that if your policy was to give it to friends for free stays there would be no point in renting it out because friends would always want it.", "NTA ask your gf if she wants to pay for the cleaning fees & repairs needed after your friends visit? No? Neither do you or your parents.", "NTA.  This not to mention there is also a cost to clean and get the place ready for the next renter.  It would cost money to let your friends just use the place."]}
