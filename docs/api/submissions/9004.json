Didn\u2019t mention when, or for what, or for how long,  they\u2019re awful at planning anything. I told them they would have to reserve it ahead of time and that there\u2019s a minimum stay time, I think a few weeks, I didn\u2019t know how much it costs at the time but did convey that they\u2019d have to pay for it. They were upset and mad that I couldn\u2019t take them for free like I had years ago when we were all in school. \nI don\u2019t have much interest in going with them to begin with, and am almost certain I would get roped into planning the whole trip for them. This used to be the norm but since I stopped doing it for them, pretty much nothing gets done. The last time I took this group there it was awful, tons of planning with no help from them, more people than I would\u2019ve liked, too much drinking, and weed smoke everywhere.\nI stopped drinking and smoking so I wouldn\u2019t want any part of that. \nOur family set a minimum stay time to dismay people from booking for a weekend and throwing parties, Im pretty sure that\u2019s exactly what they want, plus the friend group had gotten much bigger since the last trip roughly 7 years ago. \nMy GF called me an AH for of this, saying she\u2019d never charge her friends for something like this, I told her I wouldn\u2019t be pocketing the money, it would go to my parents mostly and she kinda changed her stance but still thinks I was wrong. My roommate told me it was the right thing to do, making them be accountable and understand the house isn\u2019t a free space for me or them. So I wanted to get someone else\u2019s opinion. My friends aren\u2019t too torn up about it and not mad anymore but i still feel bad about it.

Your friends asked, you had totally reasonable answer. Anyone thinking otherwhise has not thought it through.\n\nOne great benefit it going through booking agent etc that there's a paper trail, maybe even insurance and I guess someone's credit card used as guarantee (?) to make sure any damage and cleaning fees are compensated. It's harder to evade those than just party all weekend and expect you to clean up...", "INFO: why are you even talking to these people anymore?", "NTA\nYou don\u2019t owe your friends free stays because you had given it them free in the past\n\nYour gf can give out her family\u2019s vacation for free if she wants but has no business with yours. \n\nDon\u2019t feel bad, they asked you told them what to do.

It\u2019s come completely normal that they would have to rent the house.

You have made clear the conditions under which they can go back to the house, it is up to them to decide whether they think it is worth it or not.
