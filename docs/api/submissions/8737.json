(Scroll to the bottom of the post for update)\n\nMy best friend and I were planning to go out for dinner to this new place for ages. It's not a typical restaurant per say, it's a place where the minute you order something you pay and then go collect it from the counter, but sit in a fine dining type setting with plates etc (a mix between a fast food type thing and restaurant).\n\nMy best friend asked me if she could get her new boyfriend over to the restaurant with her. I've heard a lot about him and don't like him that much. I said no, very politely multiple times. I wanted to have a nice day out with her, no stranger. I told her that I could meet him some other time, not then.\n\nFast forward to the restaurant. I reserve a table for us and get there a little before her. She shows up, few minutes later, with her boyfriend. I was super nice in front of him, but later i dragged her to the side and told her how this wasn't okay. I wasn't expecting a stranger. She said it was apparently a 'surprise for me'. She saw me roll my eyes and got a little angry.\n\nWe go buy the food, i buy mine, she buys their both's. When the bill comes, she just divides it by two. At first, looking at that, i jokingly ask if she's giving me a treat too (i wasn't gonna let her anyways, we're both on pocket money). She said no, she was just splitting it between the two of us. \n\nHer boyfriend ordered 2 burgers for himself and a huge tumbler of lemonade. That's almost a meal for 2 more. I asked her if he's paying for himself, she said no.  She said:\n\n'I got him here so that YOU can meet him'\n'He's here only for you, you can pay for him after making him feel unwelcome, it's the least you can do'\n\nI was visibly livid. I paid for my food, went back to the table and asked him for the money very politely. He said 'I came here to meet you, i assumed it was your treat, I am not paying'\n\nThis is the part where i may be wrong:\nI got up, asked the server to pack my food and called him a cheapo and good for nothing. And i told her that she's no better. I told the cashier extremely loudly to take the bill from him after pointing at him. \n\nI then proceeded to walk out and go home. I was supposed to be her ride home, but i don't care at this point. She kept calling me insisting i created a scene for no reason, and that she doesn't have enough cash for the cab back home and to pay for the food. I just replied with: you have PayPal. (She couldn't do without her parents asking her why she's spending over her allowance and then they'll cut it from the next month's pocket money)\n\nShe sent multiple angry texts and voice notes later insisting i apologize to him. I haven't replied to any. Her parents are gonna cut her pocket money next month so she's pissed off about that as well.\n\n_UPDATE_ : (2)\nFriend called me up crying saying they broke up and apologized heavily.

I'd explain that to her and how rude it was to not only surprise you but expect you to pay his way is disrespectful and honestly not something a friend would do. \n\nI'd honestly reconsider the friendship.", "Wow with a best friend like that who needs enemies \ud83d\ude02\nIgnores you after you said no to meeting her new bf at that specific time and place and she like \"lol nah fuck that ill take him anyway and then get her to pay for him because I can walk all over her and she will just take it\" \n\nGood for you showing a shiny spine.

It\u2019s ridiculous they expected you to pay for the meal when you not only didn\u2019t invite him, but actually said no to him coming.

Your \"best\" friend.\n\nYou were being taken advantage of, obviously, with the rid and meal. Kudos to you for standing up for yourself by doing neither. You had no obligation to shuttle him around nor did you volunteer to pay for his meal.\n\nIt shouldn't need to be said, but even if someone treated you, you don't take advantage of it. If he mistakenly believed that this meal was your treat, ordering two burgers and a large tumbler says he was okay freeloading.\n\nYour \"best\" friend's behavior after you refused to be taken advantage of, with the excessive texts and blame, I'm sorry, that's not a friend.

He is a cheapo and good for nothing.", "NTA, in fact it almost seems like a setup to get you to pay for their food. She\u2019s using you", "NTA- surprising you with buying someone else\u2019s food that you already said you didn\u2019t want to meet isn\u2019t a real surprise it\u2019s an ambush. \n\nGood for you for standing up for yourself", "Absolutely NTA, who invites someone \"by surprise\" and expects you to pay? This seems highly unreasonable. I don't think you may have \"caused a scene\" either. I think your friend and her boyfriend tried to get one over you and you didn't let them so now she's upset she couldn't pull it off.", "NTA. This is worth the scene. She invited your boyfriend to dinner with you after you asked her not to, and then she asked you to pay for part of his meal? This person isn't your friend.", "NTA but you could have handled this way differently. Simply working with the cashier to insist on a split bill would have covered it. (Just as you did, minus the ruckus.) Then you could have said, I did not extend an invitation to you so there is absolutely no reason for me to pay for your dinner. That\u2019s between you and your girlfriend.", "At first I thought no big deal she brought the guy against your wishes, after all it's within her rights even though it would have been awkward and rude.\n\nBut you're absolutely NTA.

Sounds like you need a new friend.", "Honestly, I imagine he\u2019s a cheapskate to her too and the only reason she brought him was so she didn\u2019t have to bear the burden of a mooch all alone. \n\nNTA thought you could have maybe thrown down a few dollars for your portion of the meal.", "NTA.  I think you handled this as well as could be expected.  Your friend and her bf though--they've got some balls.", "NTA. She was wrong to bring her bf to your planned lunch when you had already said \"No.\" That she did it anyway was a Red Flag. When she tried to get you to pay for the meal AND her terrible excuse was that you were treating because he was there to meet you? No, nope, no way.

She said:\r...'I got him here so that YOU can meet him' 'He's here only for you, you can pay for him after making him feel unwelcome, it's the least you can do'*\n\nThis is gaslighting, a manipulation tactic that tries to change the reality and how you think about it.  She's trying to make you believe that her refusal to respect your decision, your very clearly stated decision, is somehow a gift to you.  That somehow she did this for you.  But that's a lie.  She did this for herself, or for him, not for you.   If she had done anything for you that day, she would have not brought him.  **She owes you an apology for the lies and the attempted gaslighting.** \n\nOn top of that, to try to make you pay for his meal?  Ridiculous.   Either she's a user of other people and has always been so, or he's teaching her to do this.  **She owes you an apology for trying** to use you, for trying **to guilt you into paying**.\n\n *I paid for my food,* \n\nSo, from the business's end, you did the right thing.  No blame there.\n\n*This is the part where i may be wrong: I got up, asked the server to pack my food* \n\nIt was the only option you had left.  If you had stayed, they would have found a way to leave early and stick you with the bill, somehow.  They had just showed you their motivation was to use you, lie to you and disrespect you, and they intended to force you to pay.  Staying would have only enabled their bad behaviors.  You could have left without your food, but that wouldn't have been fair to yourself.  Leaving was a wise choice.  You do not owe them an apology for leaving.  **They owe the apology for the whole situation.**\n\n*and called him a cheapo and good for nothing. And i told her that she's no better.* \n\nWell, a bit blatant, but purely the truth.  They had already broken trust with you, and the friendship is over, because she showed you that she's willing to lie and disrespect you and try to force your compliance to her manipulation of you, which friends don't do.  So, **she's broken trust and friendship with you to try to get him a free meal.  She's shown you what price she put on your relationship.**  Sad.  But not your fault that she made these choices. \n\nSeems fair, that you tell her the truth about why you were leaving, that it was their behavior.  I might have done better, with a week or so of advanced warning and writing it out.  But that's not how these things happen to us.  So, you did fine, in the circumstances, and the emotional pain of a shattered friendship.  **You do not owe an apology for being hurt and saying why you were leaving.**\n\n*I told the cashier extremely loudly to take the bill from him after pointing at him.*\n\nCashier needed to know.  And to be able to hear you.  Hard to gauge volume in a busy place, so you made sure you didn't have to repeat yourself.  NTA.  **You do not owe an apology for making sure that the business knew who to get their money from.**\n\n*I then proceeded to walk out and go home.* \n\nGood for you.  You took excellent care of yourself in a bad situation where you were being manipulated.  Very healthy response.  \n\n*I was supposed to be her ride home, but i don't care at this point.* \n\nHer fault.  She was the one that brought the uninvited, tried to pretend it was a gift to you, and tried to force you to pay.  She broke the relationship.  That she needed to pay for what she did, that's reasonable.  **You owe no apology for leaving.**\n\n*She kept calling me insisting i created a scene for no reason,* \n\nNope.  She created the scene.  She set up this.  She schemed it out and tried to force you to comply with her demands here.  Not your fault.  Hers.  **She owes the apology for creating this mess,** not you.\n\n**You walking out?  You had plenty of reason for that.  Again, her fault.**  You took the healthy option by walking out, not enabling her manipulative behaviors and not allowing her to emotionally abuse you into compliance.\n\n*and that she doesn't have enough cash*\n\n**Her** problem.  Not yours.  \n\n*She sent multiple angry texts and voice notes later insisting i apologize to him.*\n\n**The apologies owed are to you.**  Not him.  Both he and she owe you apologies.  Even then, it's not likely that this relationship is going to continue or have any chance unless she gets help and changes her behaviors.  If she's echoing him, she might heal if she dumps him.  Still, even then, I'd not trust her again without years of proof.\n\n**Manipulators like to try to force us to apologize when they do wrong** and we won't accept it and be their enablers, when we object and refuse to let them do this to us.  It happens so often it has a name:  DARVO.  **DARVO is deny, attack, reverse victim and offender.**  Your former friend is trying to Darvo you, to make you apologize as if you did wrong and they were your victims.  \n\nIf a manipulator gets us to apologize, they can pretend that they were the victim and we did the wrong, to themselves, and this self-justification lets them not change their own behavior, but continue to behave manipulatively.  **Do not apologize to them.  It's just another step in their manipulation process, to try to force you to apologize.**  They know that you value the relationship, and they are trying to use this, to use your empathy and love for your friend to force you to \"fix\" things between you two.  But in the long run, apologizing to someone that did wrong to you only hurts you.  It sets up a situation where they force your compliance more and more easily over time, and you take on the work of always fixing things between you, so that you have this friendship. It becomes emotional abuse, and harms you deeply.  Real friends don't do this to you.  Healthy people take responsibility when they do wrong and accept the blame they earn.  **Your former friend is trying to force you to apologize for objecting to her wrong behavior.**  Don't.  \"When you are ready to apologize **to me,** for the lies and disrespect that **you** showed me, for bringing him when I told you No repeatedly, then we can talk again.

You had looked forward to meeting him later but wanted lunch with just your friend that day. \n\nThen let both of them go their way. Your friendships going forward will likely be better for this.", "That takes entitlement to a whole new level.\n\nYou said no so he turned up anyway and then because his presence was your \"treat\" expected you to pay? He has audacity if nothing else. NTA.", "Great job standing up for yourself and refusing to be ambushed and taken advantage of! NTA", "NTA", "Deff NTA. You told her no dont bring him I just want it to be us for this meal. She brought him anyway and then proceeded to split HIS food between the two of you without asking you first then proceeded to basically gaslight you? After you told her no in the first place. And your telling me that he didnt have any money either and figured if not you his girlfriend would pay for him no questions asked? What Yeaaaa na dude, you can get bent and deserve every single piece of instant karma. She needed a reality check. Dont even think about feeling bad. So NTA.", "NTA  She sprung him on you after you said no.  It was her treat.  She's lucky you paid for yourself at that point.\n\nPS She is not a real friend.  A real friend would never do that.", "100% NTA", "NTA and I\u2019m glad your friend at least apologized later, but what she did was so sh1tty I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s enough to save the friendship.  Also, the way her bf responded to the situation confirms what you already knew\u2014 he\u2019s a jerk.", "NTA.", "Break up with your friend. Periodt. If she cared even a smidgen, she wouldn't have brought him along despite your objections, and definitely wouldn't have tried to force you to pay.", "I really want to know about the bf comments but falling asleep!", "Decided to find them anyway. He says, \"YTA for causing an unnecessary scene\" and when asked why she should have paid, \"because friends have each other's back.\" Back, not backs. There was one more that's similar to the first. All downvoted to oblivion and he deleted the account.", "What would she contact a lawyer over? Lmao it was a dick move but it's not like she can sue them over it??", "Open minded to getting free food you bum", ">I was visibly livid. I paid for my food, went back to the table and asked him for the money very politely.\n\nThis \\^\\^\\^ was in the main story.", "Ah. This must have been the cheap ass bf lol.", "Think we found the Boyfriend...", "What a shitty boyfriend. Mine would insist on paying for everyone and would be mortified if a friend of mine tried paying for him. But I'm also not crazy enough to show up with him when he's clearly not wanted.", "Absolutely do not feel guilty", "And the BF is in his 30s?", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "I love how his dumb ass already deleted lol.", "Sounds like you already have it figured out", "right? everytime someone bought me food, I always chose something small or simple, i think it's rude expect that someone pay for you something taht yourself wouldn't pay", "Oh and... She is not your friend...", "NTA. You should never go out to dinner assuming someone is going to pay for you. Especially when that person is not even supposed to be invited.", "NTA. Cuz tf they thought?!?! You go girl", "NTA op. Just wanted to hop on here to say this and the comments from the boyfriend calling OP the ass for not paying for him when HE crashed their friend date: pure comedic gold. \n\nSorry you had to find out publicly that your friend sucks and also has bad taste in men. Luckily you found out now, before she tried to swindle an even larger amount of money from you for an even lamer dude \ud83e\udd23", "Wow lol, NTA. Unless he forced her into it, she is not worthy of friendship.", "NTA, but can I also say just how painfully obvious it is that everyone in this story is super young", "WOW. So NTA. Glad your friend came to her senses and apologized.", "NTA. Drop your \"friend\"", "If he wanted to meet you he should have paid for the 3 of you. He just wanted a free meal. Probably didn\u2019t give his girlfriend a choice about going without. NTA", "NTA and this bf is a loser", "NTA - They were 1000% taking advantage of you.", "NTA OP, and I hope you don\u2019t easily forgive or forgive your friend for pulling that stunt on you.", "ESH - She was being crazy and awful. I cannot fathom why she would do this. But I think you should have just refused to pay for them and then left without calling them names in front of the restaurant.", "This can't be real. How do people even form sentences like that? \"I came here to meet you. I am not paying\" lmao.", "get a job bum", "Only someone who\u2019s a giant p o s would think she\u2019s TA. Or the friends ex bf lol", "Oh man, another new account as of today.   Someone\u2019s butt hurt \ud83d\ude02.   I\u2019d you were credible, you\u2019d at least state why she\u2019s TA but it seems like you are either the best friend, the ex boyfriend or someone just like him lmao", "Maybe make sure what you are posting hasn't already been covered. She literally said in the original it was paid for", "OP also tried to set a fair boundary and friend agreed, friend then blindsided OP, tried getting her money, and teamed with AH bf to gaslight her!", "you in honorary fbi internet agent badge award today cuz I was def reading every comment tryna find it hahah", "It's not unusual for someone to be abusive in public with the assumption that the other person won't make a scene, i. e., refuse to be abused. Good for you that you didn't!", "The highlight is that they used gaslighting incorrectly.", "My now-husband did this as well. Whenever we went to meet any of my friends, he insisted on paying.\n\nAmusingly, all of the friends I had before I met him were awful moochers. Easy way to cut the chaff out of my contacts list lol", "\\^\\^ Basically exactly what I said. people make mistakes and definitely become blinded by boyfriends and girlfriends early on, question is... is this growing pains or is this a person who forgets all of her values and people for the guy?", "This would not surprise me in the least!", "They literally wrote a thesis, where a simple NTA, you aren't obliged.to pay for her bf would've sufficed lol. And there was no gaslighting anywhere but it's the cool new term so has to get thrown in", "Yep this is either growing pains or a deeper issue she has with losing herself in relationships... and choosing shitty, shitty men...", "yes because it\u2019s a woman\u2019s job to make sure some unknown bum doesn\u2019t feel embarrassed", "I broke off a TWENTY yr friendship because I was tired of being a friend but not having one in return. \n\nTime means nothing. She knows what she did. Know your worth sweetie. You don't need the apology you seek", "People jump to dumping people so fast on here. Sounds like this guy sucks and maybe it was his idea and him pushing her to act like this way. Sometimes when we are younger, we do way too much for those we are attracted to.\n\n Great that they broke up! I would definitely watch out for this behavior tho. Even if she has a heart of gold under there, more boyfriends will come..", "It isn\u2019t.", "Sounds like you don't", "Technically they aren't the bf any more since OP said the two split.  Dudes a goober.", "I hate freeloaders the most! Nta", ">Scroll to the bottom of the post for update\n\nThank you!  People who put the update at the top are the WORST.\n\nNTA, for the obvious reasons everyone has already said.", "NTA she's not your friend", "NTA.\nIf you invite someone to a meal, you pay. If they invite you, they pay. If you both decide to go somewhere together, you split the bill.\n\nIf someone invites themself, they don\u2019t get to insist you pay for their meal. It\u2019s not how it works.", "NTA. I cut off a 35 year friendship last year because I was tired of scenarios like this. It\u2019s been one year of FREEDOM- and good people.", "Hon, you already know you're NTA! Your former friend and her ex are off the rails entitled. Damn. Are the young people OK? GOOD, HONEST friends seriously do not do this to each other!", "NTA. She\u2019s using you\u2026by far. Actual friends won\u2019t surprise bombshell you with it( especially after discussing it), let alone assume you will contribute toward the bill. Ur \u201cfriend\u201d and her bf are too abhorrent and self absorbed to be any level of considerate and used u for free food. It was never abt u meeting him; it was abt u providing for them. I\u2019m sorry ur dealing with this. It\u2019s total entitlement bullshittery that u should not and don\u2019t deserve to deal with", "NTA at allllll, this is unhinged and so rude. Who behaves that way *and* expects you to foot the bill for this third wheel??", "Commenting on the top post to find out if anyone has found the bf\u2019s comment and can link it here", "Friend:  And now the love of my life has dumped me because my friend wouldn't buy his meal after I surprised her with him!  How can I get him back?!?", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pmeud/aita_for_creating_a_scene_at_a_restaurant_with_my/j6navs2?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3\n\nHere", "Thank you. Went thru a lot of comments without finding. And NTA", "Lmao this is just pathetic", "I assume that was there from the beginning? If so I missed it and I apologize!", "Even after they broke up **REMEMBER THIS** I\u2019m not one to dump friends lightly, but she ignored everything you said\n\nIf you choose to continue the relationship, go slowly and carefully", "Right? She made her own choices. Even if her boyfriend was influencing her she made a decision and if she did it with this boyfriend she'll do it with another dick ass boyfriend down the road", "Yep, sunken cost fallacy"]}
