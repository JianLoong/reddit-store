(Scroll to the bottom of the post for update)\n\nMy best friend and I were planning to go out for dinner to this new place for ages. It's not a typical restaurant per say, it's a place where the minute you order something you pay and then go collect it from the counter, but sit in a fine dining type setting with plates etc (a mix between a fast food type thing and restaurant).\n\nMy best friend asked me if she could get her new boyfriend over to the restaurant with her. I've heard a lot about him and don't like him that much. I said no, very politely multiple times. I wanted to have a nice day out with her, no stranger. I told her that I could meet him some other time, not then.\n\nFast forward to the restaurant. I reserve a table for us and get there a little before her. She shows up, few minutes later, with her boyfriend. I was super nice in front of him, but later i dragged her to the side and told her how this wasn't okay. I wasn't expecting a stranger. She said it was apparently a 'surprise for me'. She saw me roll my eyes and got a little angry.\n\nWe go buy the food, i buy mine, she buys their both's. When the bill comes, she just divides it by two. At first, looking at that, i jokingly ask if she's giving me a treat too (i wasn't gonna let her anyways, we're both on pocket money). She said no, she was just splitting it between the two of us. \n\nHer boyfriend ordered 2 burgers for himself and a huge tumbler of lemonade. That's almost a meal for 2 more. I asked her if he's paying for himself, she said no.  She said:\n\n'I got him here so that YOU can meet him'\n'He's here only for you, you can pay for him after making him feel unwelcome, it's the least you can do'\n\nI was visibly livid. I paid for my food, went back to the table and asked him for the money very politely. He said 'I came here to meet you, i assumed it was your treat, I am not paying'\n\nThis is the part where i may be wrong:\nI got up, asked the server to pack my food and called him a cheapo and good for nothing. And i told her that she's no better. I told the cashier extremely loudly to take the bill from him after pointing at him. \n\nI then proceeded to walk out and go home. I was supposed to be her ride home, but i don't care at this point. She kept calling me insisting i created a scene for no reason, and that she doesn't have enough cash for the cab back home and to pay for the food. I just replied with: you have PayPal. (She couldn't do without her parents asking her why she's spending over her allowance and then they'll cut it from the next month's pocket money)\n\nShe sent multiple angry texts and voice notes later insisting i apologize to him. I haven't replied to any. Her parents are gonna cut her pocket money next month so she's pissed off about that as well.\n\n_UPDATE_ : \nFriend called me up crying saying they broke up and apologized heavily.

It\u2019s ridiculous they expected you to pay for the meal when you not only didn\u2019t invite him, but actually said no to him coming.

Your \"best\" friend.\n\nYou were being taken advantage of, obviously, with the rid and meal. Kudos to you for standing up for yourself by doing neither. You had no obligation to shuttle him around nor did you volunteer to pay for his meal.\n\nIt shouldn't need to be said, but even if someone treated you, you don't take advantage of it.

She invited your boyfriend to dinner with you after you asked her not to, and then she asked you to pay for part of his meal? This person isn't your friend.", "NTA but you could have handled this way differently. Simply working with the cashier to insist on a split bill would have covered it.

That\u2019s between you and your girlfriend.", "At first I thought no big deal she brought the guy against your wishes, after all it's within her rights even though it would have been awkward and rude.\n\nBut you're absolutely NTA.

I think you handled this as well as could be expected.  Your friend and her bf though--they've got some balls.", "NTA. She was wrong to bring her bf to your planned lunch when you had already said \"No.\" That she did it anyway was a Red Flag.

She's trying to make you believe that her refusal to respect your decision, your very clearly stated decision, is somehow a gift to you.  That somehow she did this for you.  But that's a lie.  She did this for herself, or for him, not for you.   If she had done anything for you that day, she would have not brought him.  **She owes you an apology for the lies and the attempted gaslighting.** \n\nOn top of that, to try to make you pay for his meal?  Ridiculous.   Either she's a user of other people and has always been so, or he's teaching her to do this.  **She owes you an apology for trying** to use you, for trying **to guilt you into paying**.\n\n *I paid for my food,* \n\nSo, from the business's end, you did the right thing.  No blame there.\n\n*This is the part where i may be wrong: I got up, asked the server to pack my food* \n\nIt was the only option you had left.  If you had stayed, they would have found a way to leave early and stick you with the bill, somehow.  They had just showed you their motivation was to use you, lie to you and disrespect you, and they intended to force you to pay.  Staying would have only enabled their bad behaviors.  You could have left without your food, but that wouldn't have been fair to yourself.  Leaving was a wise choice.  You do not owe them an apology for leaving.  **They owe the apology for the whole situation.**\n\n*and called him a cheapo and good for nothing. And i told her that she's no better.* \n\nWell, a bit blatant, but purely the truth.  They had already broken trust with you, and the friendship is over, because she showed you that she's willing to lie and disrespect you and try to force your compliance to her manipulation of you, which friends don't do.  So, **she's broken trust and friendship with you to try to get him a free meal.  She's shown you what price she put on your relationship.**  Sad.  But not your fault that she made these choices. \n\nSeems fair, that you tell her the truth about why you were leaving, that it was their behavior.  I might have done better, with a week or so of advanced warning and writing it out.  But that's not how these things happen to us.  So, you did fine, in the circumstances, and the emotional pain of a shattered friendship.  **You do not owe an apology for being hurt and saying why you were leaving.**\n\n*I told the cashier extremely loudly to take the bill from him after pointing at him.*\n\nCashier needed to know.  And to be able to hear you.  Hard to gauge volume in a busy place, so you made sure you didn't have to repeat yourself.  NTA.  **You do not owe an apology for making sure that the business knew who to get their money from.**\n\n*I then proceeded to walk out and go home.* \n\nGood for you.  You took excellent care of yourself in a bad situation where you were being manipulated.  Very healthy response.  \n\n*I was supposed to be her ride home, but i don't care at this point.* \n\nHer fault.  She was the one that brought the uninvited, tried to pretend it was a gift to you, and tried to force you to pay.  She broke the relationship.  That she needed to pay for what she did, that's reasonable.  **You owe no apology for leaving.**\n\n*She kept calling me insisting i created a scene for no reason,* \n\nNope.  She created the scene.  She set up this.  She schemed it out and tried to force you to comply with her demands here.  Not your fault.  Hers.  **She owes the apology for creating this mess,** not you.\n\n**You walking out?  You had plenty of reason for that.  Again, her fault.**  You took the healthy option by walking out, not enabling her manipulative behaviors and not allowing her to emotionally abuse you into compliance.\n\n*and that she doesn't have enough cash*\n\n**Her** problem.  Not yours.  \n\n*She sent multiple angry texts and voice notes later insisting i apologize to him.*\n\n**The apologies owed are to you.**  Not him.  Both he and she owe you apologies.  Even then, it's not likely that this relationship is going to continue or have any chance unless she gets help and changes her behaviors.  If she's echoing him, she might heal if she dumps him.  Still, even then, I'd not trust her again without years of proof.\n\n**Manipulators like to try to force us to apologize when they do wrong** and we won't accept it and be their enablers, when we object and refuse to let them do this to us.  It happens so often it has a name:  DARVO.  **DARVO is deny, attack, reverse victim and offender.**  Your former friend is trying to Darvo you, to make you apologize as if you did wrong and they were your victims.  \n\nIf a manipulator gets us to apologize, they can pretend that they were the victim and we did the wrong, to themselves, and this self-justification lets them not change their own behavior, but continue to behave manipulatively.  **Do not apologize to them.  It's just another step in their manipulation process, to try to force you to apologize.**  They know that you value the relationship, and they are trying to use this, to use your empathy and love for your friend to force you to \"fix\" things between you two.  But in the long run, apologizing to someone that did wrong to you only hurts you.  It sets up a situation where they force your compliance more and more easily over time, and you take on the work of always fixing things between you, so that you have this friendship. It becomes emotional abuse, and harms you deeply.  Real friends don't do this to you.  Healthy people take responsibility when they do wrong and accept the blame they earn.  **Your former friend is trying to force you to apologize for objecting to her wrong behavior.**  Don't.  \"When you are ready to apologize **to me,** for the lies and disrespect that **you** showed me, for bringing him when I told you No repeatedly, then we can talk again.  Until then, I see no point in us talking.\"", "NTA. They're both idiots.", "NTA doesn't sound like much a friend and someone who is looking at you like a supplemental wallet.", "NTA.  Ditch her! Not your friend!", "Nta\n\nI usually don't care for nta posts, I'm a amithedevil kinda lurker but DAMN did this post fire me up\n\nHow fuckin dare they", "NTA \n\nFirst of all she should have listened to your No and come alone.  Second of all even if you had agreed for the bf to come - there absolutely should have never been an expectation for you to pay for him.", "I simply cannot fathom why you haven't heard good things about this guy. No marinara flags in this story.....", "Right?! It\u2019s like, stop. You\u2019re making this up, right?", "This 1000x!!!", "Thank you!! Appreciate it!", "Right?", "I think that\u2019s what the boyfriend wanted. My theory is that he invited himself and wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer, decided OP could foot the bill then behaved appallingly to cause this scene. Now he\u2019s got the best friend all to himself; she\u2019s going to end up isolated.", "I agree. He\u2019s isolating BF so he can control her. She needs to get rid before she has no friends left.", "I never liked him in the first place because she changed a lot after him. He's a super spoilt kid, and she's following those lines", "Thank you for this. I was feeling guilty about this whole thing. I don't anymore. Appreciate your advice.", "Do you mooch?", "Trueee", "Gurl she has shown she\u2019s not a good friend. She didn\u2019t listen to you and only did things to benefit her. Right now she even complained about her spendings for next month being cut instead of caring about how you feel. She is an L friend and you deserve better \ud83d\ude0c", "You having to pay for his meal at all is ridiculous, but the fact that he ordered so much food?  When someone else was footing the bill?  Talk about entitled and disrespectful.  If you didn't have a low opinion of him before, that alone should bottom it out.  You know exactly what kind of person he is.\n\nAlso, I've been to restaurants similar-ish to what you described.  It's so weird that they'd ask you to come back and pay after you already placed and paid for your order.  I mean if all 3 of you ordered together and they asked you to pay half, it would still be wrong but at least it would logistically make sense.  But why are you paying for a stranger's food?  Someone you didn't want to meet?  At an expensive restaurant?\n\nThe whole scene says a lot about your friend too.  Is this really a friendship worth continuing?  (can you even afford to financially?)", "We were all young once, and make mistakes. Maybe she'll see the error of her ways, and genuinely apologise. If she does not, then do not settle for this sort of terrible behaviour. What she did was not friendship, she was using you.\n\nBear in mind that she chosen has a BF who has similar values, who also thought this behaviour was acceptable. That tells you something. She may pretend to be sorry, but she might have already shown you her real character. There are plenty of people out there who'll act decently that would be good friends.\n\nBrilliant response from you at the time by the way!", "That\u2019s one of her twisted reasons why she thought it was OK - it\u2019s your parents\u2019 money", "OP is better without her \"friend\", who the f brings someone who are not welcomed and later try to \"guilty\" her into paying for food? NTA", "Absolutely NTA, who invites someone \"by surprise\" and expects you to pay? This seems highly unreasonable. I don't think you may have \"caused a scene\" either. I think your friend and her boyfriend tried to get one over you and you didn't let them so now she's upset she couldn't pull it off.", "Thanks!!", "Don't know why you've gotten so many downvotes :/"]}
