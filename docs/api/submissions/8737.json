{"id": 8737, "submission_id": "10pmeud", "title": "AITA for 'creating a scene' at a restaurant with my best friend?", "selftext": "My best friend and I were planning to go out for dinner to this new place for ages. It's not a typical restaurant per say, it's a place where the minute you order something you pay and then go collect it from the counter, but sit in a fine dining type setting with plates etc (a mix between a fast food type thing and restaurant).\n\nMy best friend asked me if she could get her new boyfriend over to the restaurant with her. I've heard a lot about him and don't like him that much. I said no, very politely multiple times. I wanted to have a nice day out with her, no stranger. I told her that I could meet him some other time, not then.\n\nFast forward to the restaurant. I reserve a table for us and get there a little before her. She shows up, few minutes later, with her boyfriend. I was super nice in front of him, but later i dragged her to the side and told her how this wasn't okay. I wasn't expecting a stranger. She said it was apparently a 'surprise for me'. She saw me roll my eyes and got a little angry.\n\nWe go buy the food, i buy mine, she buys their both's. When the bill comes, she just divides it by two. At first, looking at that, i jokingly ask if she's giving me a treat too (i wasn't gonna let her anyways, we're both on pocket money). She said no, she was just splitting it between the two of us. \n\nHer boyfriend ordered 2 burgers for himself and a huge tumbler of lemonade. That's almost a meal for 2 more. I asked her if he's paying for himself, she said no.  She said:\n\n'I got him here so that YOU can meet him'\n'He's here only for you, you can pay for him after making him feel unwelcome, it's the least you can do'\n\nI was visibly livid. I paid for my food, went back to the table and asked him for the money very politely. He said 'I came here to meet you, i assumed it was your treat, I am not paying'\n\nThis is the part where i may be wrong:\nI got up, asked the server to pack my food and called him a cheapo and good for nothing. And i told her that she's no better. I told the cashier extremely loudly to take the bill from him after pointing at him. \n\nI then proceeded to walk out and go home. I was supposed to be her ride home, but i don't care at this point. She kept calling me insisting i created a scene for no reason, and that she doesn't have enough cash for the cab back home and to pay for the food. I just replied with: you have PayPal. (She couldn't do without her parents asking her why she's spending over her allowance and then they'll cut it from the next month's pocket money)\n\nShe sent multiple angry texts and voice notes later insisting i apologize to him. I haven't replied to any. Her parents are gonna cut her pocket money next month so she's pissed off about that as well.", "created_utc": 1675134291, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pmeud/aita_for_creating_a_scene_at_a_restaurant_with_my/", "score": 183, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Come on, your just being used as a bank account at this point.", "NTA.  Wow, your friend has some serious AUDACITY, but apparently it's no match for your shiny stainless steel spine. Sounds like your moochy friend and her lil moochy fling were made for each other. Might be a good time to let that friendship cool off until she decides to respect your boundaries.", "NTA - You did express numerous times you didn't want him to come and for it to be the two of you. She not only sprung it on you but expected you to pay. I'd explain that to her and how rude it was to not only surprise you but expect you to pay his way is disrespectful and honestly not something a friend would do. \n\nI'd honestly reconsider the friendship.", "Wow with a best friend like that who needs enemies \ud83d\ude02\nIgnores you after you said no to meeting her new bf at that specific time and place and she like \"lol nah fuck that ill take him anyway and then get her to pay for him because I can walk all over her and she will just take it\" \n\nGood for you showing a shiny spine. I'd suggest drop them both like hot garbage before they try and get anything else from you.", "NTA. Get a new friend. She wants you to pay for her bf and then drive her around - woof", "You need a better friend. Does she even respect you?? NTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s ridiculous they expected you to pay for the meal when you not only didn\u2019t invite him, but actually said no to him coming. Your friend was incredibly rude and it sounds like they were trying to get a free meal off of you! And any \u201cscene\u201d you made sounds really minimal.", "BWHAHAHAHAH SHE INVITED HER BF OUT AFTER YOU SAID NO **AND ** EXPECTED YOU TO PAY FOR IT??? NTA", "NTA. I sat here and reread this post a couple times before commenting. What came to mind was, \"how they treat you in front of other people is how they talk about you behind your back\". Your \"best\" friend.\n\nYou were being taken advantage of, obviously, with the rid and meal. Kudos to you for standing up for yourself by doing neither. You had no obligation to shuttle him around nor did you volunteer to pay for his meal.\n\nIt shouldn't need to be said, but even if someone treated you, you don't take advantage of it. If he mistakenly believed that this meal was your treat, ordering two burgers and a large tumbler says he was okay freeloading.\n\nYour \"best\" friend's behavior after you refused to be taken advantage of, with the excessive texts and blame, I'm sorry, that's not a friend. Familiarize yourself with your phone's block function and be prepared to use it. Good luck, OP.", "NTA. Your friend, and her new boyfriend, sound like a couple of obnoxious jerks.", "NTA. He is a cheapo and good for nothing.", "NTA, in fact it almost seems like a setup to get you to pay for their food. She\u2019s using you", "NTA- surprising you with buying someone else\u2019s food that you already said you didn\u2019t want to meet isn\u2019t a real surprise it\u2019s an ambush. \n\nGood for you for standing up for yourself", "Absolutely NTA, who invites someone \"by surprise\" and expects you to pay? This seems highly unreasonable. I don't think you may have \"caused a scene\" either. I think your friend and her boyfriend tried to get one over you and you didn't let them so now she's upset she couldn't pull it off.", "NTA. This is worth the scene. She invited your boyfriend to dinner with you after you asked her not to, and then she asked you to pay for part of his meal? This person isn't your friend.", "NTA but you could have handled this way differently. Simply working with the cashier to insist on a split bill would have covered it. (Just as you did, minus the ruckus.) Then you could have said, I did not extend an invitation to you so there is absolutely no reason for me to pay for your dinner. That\u2019s between you and your girlfriend.", "At first I thought no big deal she brought the guy against your wishes, after all it's within her rights even though it would have been awkward and rude.\n\nBut you're absolutely NTA. She won royal A-H of the day (at least) when she demanded that you pay for his food. That is also winnder of  the Entitlement Olympics.", "NTA Publicly shame your friend, go NC and you might want to contact a lawyer. This is absolutely obscene behavior, these people deserve nothing but pain and misery in their life.", "NTA\n\nYou told her you weren't interested in meeting him at the restaurant and then she tried to have you pay his meal. Just no. That was manipulative as all get out.", "NTA, she crossed a boundary that you had repeated, then expected you to pay. Sounds like you need a new friend.", "Honestly, I imagine he\u2019s a cheapskate to her too and the only reason she brought him was so she didn\u2019t have to bear the burden of a mooch all alone. \n\nNTA thought you could have maybe thrown down a few dollars for your portion of the meal.", "NTA.  I think you handled this as well as could be expected.  Your friend and her bf though--they've got some balls.", "NTA. She was wrong to bring her bf to your planned lunch when you had already said \"No.\" That she did it anyway was a Red Flag. When she tried to get you to pay for the meal AND her terrible excuse was that you were treating because he was there to meet you? No, nope, no way.  That was a big Red Bus that was trying to run you over.  Take the hint - she is NOT your friend.", "NTA\n\nShe was out of line from top to bottom! \n\nYou were clear about not wanting to meet him that night.  \n\nShe brought him anyway. \n\nYou politely put on a pleasant face for him and addressed her privately with your displeasure. \n\nShe acted like you were rejecting an awesome gift.\n\nThey both just assumed that you were going to cover half of his large meal and then pitched a tantrum when you refused to be cornered and are now blaming you for the results of their behavior? \n\nAnd he IS a\n\n>cheapo and good for nothing.\n\nAny decent human being would be mortified to presume on their new partner's (allegedly) best friend like that and certainly wouldn't be pretending that their mere presence is such a boon that the friend should be thrilled to pay for their meal.", "NTA After telling her NOT to bring him and then she does was rude of her.
