We had many conversations during our relationship about having kids and he was always more excited about it than I was, only to leave when I got pregnant and chose to keep it. He didn\u2019t contact for the first 5 months of my pregnancy and when he finally did, he apologised for leaving and said he wanted to be involved in our daughter\u2019s life. I refused to take him back but we agreed on co-parenting. Fast forward to when she was born, he showed interest and sent money for the first month then stopped. He still hasn\u2019t come to meet her despite me asking countless times. I still sent him pics of her but he ignored them along with every message I sent. I even sent him pics of her first Christmas and asked if he wanted to come see her or FaceTime at least and once again, he ignored. I gave our daughter my last name and left him off the birth certificate. Out of curiosity, I went on his twitter page only to find him flirting with every girl under the sun so there\u2019s definitely nothing wrong with his phone.

Trust me when I say its better as a kid not having someone like him in your life than having them pop in and out.", "I mean, NTA here, but I think you might be doing yourself and your daughter an injustice by not pursuing child support.  The world financial situation is bad, and you might need the help (assuming he is employed).", "NTA.\n\nYour ex is just a sperm donor at this point.\n\n>He was always excited about it than I was, only to leave when I got pregnant and chose to keep it.\n\nHe can\u2019t be excited about having kid and then bolt when the time came for the kid to meet the world and (in this case) her parent\n\n>He didn\u2019t contact me for the first 5 months of pregnancy and when he finally did, he apologised for leaving and said he wanted to be involved in our daughter's life.\n\nObviously he doesn\u2019t want to be in his daughter's life. Your boyfriend is not mature enough for kids. You wasted your time trying to get him involved. OP go to family court and get full custody of your daugher", "NTA. And If He avoids contact you can't do anything anyway.\nBut get him to pay child support. It's his and he has to own Up in this at least", "Not if he\u2019s going to be a deadbeat dad that\u2019s more trouble than he\u2019s worth", "NTA \n\nThere is nothing worse than a person who comes in and out of a child\u2019s life. You are saving your daughter from heartache at a delicate age. When she is older if she chooses to seek him out, or allow him into her life if he seeks her out, that is her decision. For now though, I think you\u2019ve done the right thing.", "NTA. Block him. He has other ways to contact you. If he wants something to do with his kid, he is more than welcome to sue you for custody or visitation, but I highly doubt he'll do it, because that means he'll have to pay child support.\n\nThat being said... you need to sue him for child support, even if you don't technically need it. It could help you set up some money aside for emergency or for college.", "NTA - A friend of mine had a similarish situation and he seems like a fairweather father. When it suits he might, but there won't be any kinda consistency. Not worth the uncertainty it will create in the child's life.", "NTA\n\nHe seems uninterested in parenting. I know folks who grew up with one parent who was present and other who had one parent who was present and another who was sporadically involved.  The second group had it much harder than the first by my observation.", "NTA. But I don't see why it's necessary to block him. He's not harassing you and he may change his mind in the future and I think you should leave that as a possibility.", "NTA, and congratulations. Raise your daughter, if he\u2019s serious, blocking him isn\u2019t going to stop him from contacting you.", "NTA\n\nwhat dad? Sperm donor at best. Daughter deserves her child support. If you don't need it, save it for her.", "NTA. You should file a child support claim on his ass. Don't let him off the hook financially", "NTABut why block him? Is it hard for you to get past thinking about trying to have him in your daughters life? Can you not just walk away? Blocking him makes it hard for him to come find you, it closes the door. Maybe that\u2019s easier, if you know the door is closed to you you won\u2019t fret on it? That\u2019s ok\u2026 you can give yourself permission to stop having this take up residence in your mind. If he really wants to find you, after eight years together, he can find a way\u2026. So blocking him to clear him out of your mind is fine.\n\nIf he really wants to find you/her in the future he will\u2026 there\u2019s mutual friends, online accounts, family etc who have known him over the years.\n\nEdit to add\u2026 consider child support. Sometimes it\u2019s just not worth the hassle and fight and sometimes it is. A few dollars hard fought for isn\u2019t worth it, but if he has a good job and a responsible family ethos, then he really should make sure his daughter has a fair chance to have a better quality of life.", ">Am I doing my daughter an injustice by blocking her dad?\n\nThe injustice you are doing her is not going to court to get a legal judgment for custody/visitation/support.  Couples who can't agree about parenting prior to a breakup rarely do any better when they've actually split.\n\nESH, Everybody Sucks Here.", "YTA - but only for blocking him\n\nYou and your child keep living your lives. Don't reach out to him unless it's literally a life or death emergency. If he chooses to not engage, that's on him. When the child is older and says \"why doesn't dad do {thing} your only answer is\" That's a good question - you should ask him\". Do not excuse or explain his actions. \n\nBlocking him, talking bad (however true) about him can come back later and hurt you in any custody case.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The worse thing he could do is damage the child by being in and out, making promises only to break them. Keep all the texts and messages for proof you tried to engage him but his engagement is no your responsibility.", "I'm going to go with NTA if you decide to not contact him anymore. That's fine. Blocking him though, well, that's something you really need to reconsider. IMO, there's going to be a difference in not letting your ex get in contact with you and your ex not even trying to contact you about your child.

Don\u2019t make her process your relationship with him as well.", "NTA but he needs to provide financially for his child. Get a child support order.", "NTA. He needs to sign over his parental rights so he can't pop up in 10 years and demand to see her.", "Yes, YTA.  Your daughter's father is her father, no matter what.  The only way I would have said otherwise is if he were crossing a boundary by harrassing or threatening you; in that case, go to court.  Always leave the line open and the ball in his court.\n\nOut of curiosity, why leave him off the birth certificate?  What about child support?", "ESH. What's the point of blocking him if he never reaches out anyway? To make you feel better that you did something?  Go get the child support... and move on.", "In order for one to get child support, there needs to be a paternity test done to prove him the father since she left his name off of the birth certificate. Then, from there, it would all be about court battling. :(", "Yes, i understand and this was a grave misjudgement in her part, I think. I don't know how it is with her legal System, in our country you can add the father's Name later. This way it is possible to receive child support claims and only if he is not the father she will be alegible for paying his expenses. Paternity test and legal fees. Otherwise he is obligated to pay. The paternity test will be court ordered by the way so he can't ignore it under penalty charges.\nBut I don't know If this is how it works for her legal Situation.", "Very true."]}
