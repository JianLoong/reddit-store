His entire family is ripping me to shreds and I don\u2019t understand. So my ex and I have a son together who is six. We split up when he was one and things were messy at first but have been peaceful for the past four years or so. We\u2019ve both moved on and entered new relationships. His girlfriend he\u2019s been with since the beginning of 2022 is such a kind woman and always went out of her way to befriend me which was nice. When they announced their pregnancy everyone was pleasantly surprised but it was pretty soon after his latest breakup so his family didn\u2019t like her which I found odd since that\u2019s not her fault. But I digress. \n\nSadly she passed away in childbirth and the baby also passed as well in November of 2022. It was extremely heartbreaking, I cried and grieved her loss as well. My ex understandably had his entire earth shattered and was going through one of the worst times of his life so I completely understood him needing time to not be a parent and didn\u2019t have any issues with that. He didn\u2019t reply to any of my messages except to say he didn\u2019t want our son to know as he was excited to have a little brother and wants to be the one to tell him and that was in November. He also didn\u2019t want our son to attend the funeral. I completely understood and didn\u2019t tell my son expecting my ex to keep his word. \n\nIn December I still heard no word from him regarding our son or coparenting situation. I completely understood he needed time and waited. In January still no word. . My husband said that even with what happened he should at least call or FaceTime if he can\u2019t do in person parenting and I agree. I reached out to his parents then and they said that they are willing to \u201cparent\u201d their grandson while their son grieves. My son is six, he\u2019s old enough to understand some things. He\u2019s been asking non stop about his dad and little brother and when he\u2019s going to meet them. I had told them that they were very busy and daddy would come see him soon to let him know but I can only use that excuse for so long.\n\n I did tell him in the beginning of February the truth, that his stepmom passed away and so did the baby and that they are in heaven and that daddy is sad and needs time to rest and feel better. That actually really helped him understand and he stopped asking and instead was drawing pictures to cheer his dad up. Yesterday he messaged me for the first time in months saying he wants to see our son for HIS birthday (my ex not my sons) which is next weekend and he wants to explain everything then. I told him since he went ghost on me since November I told our son earlier in the month since he wouldn\u2019t stop asking and he needed answers. He started cursing at me saying I\u2019m a bitch and asshole and that it wasn\u2019t my place to tell him and that I \u201ctook that away from him\u201d. He hung up and now his siblings and parents are posting subs at me online and calling me and texting me saying the same.

Your son is six and had no idea why he wasn't getting to see his dad, stepmom, and baby brother. You couldn't keep making excuses and lying to him. I can only imagine how it would feel to a six year old to keep hearing that his father is too busy to see him.", "NTA. came fully ready to say you were, but the period of time between when it happened and when you told him was enough that it was negatively affecting your son. Tbh, your ex is an AH for depriving your son of ***his own*** grieving process and not letting him attend the funeral. He lost someone too, and his father denied him his own experience.   \n\n\nDad needs to learn not everything is about him. You \"took that away from\" fully implies that how he wanted to tell the son (including waiting so long) was all about **his own** grieving process, and wasn't centered on the son's needs even a little bit. Dad wasn't looking out for your kids needs, you were.", "NTA. He should have taken care of that himself in the first week or two. He left it for 3 MONTHS. People, including kids, deserve better than that.", "NTA - I am so sorry that all of you have been going through this.  You have gone above and beyond to help your ex cope with his grief, but you have to do what is best for your son.  Your child and his well-being need to be your first priority - above that of his father.\n\nTo put it very bluntly, it's been 3 months since your son saw his father in person, which is not okay.  I understand that your ex is grieving, however it's not fair to your son that he got put aside with no explanation for such a long period of time.  \n\n3 months is also excessive for not telling your son about the death of his step-mom and baby sibling.  He's 6, so he's in elementary school, and well able to understand what's happened, even if it's just on a basic level.  It sounds like you did an excellent job of breaking the news.  Yes, I get that it wasn't your news to tell, but to your point, you can't make an excuse forever.  Your son knows the baby was supposed to come 3 months ago, so where's the baby?  \n\nAs for your ex's family, I'd simply tell them that you gave him months to tell your son.  He didn't.  He hasn't even seen your son in person.  After 2 months had passed, you finally told your son the truth.  That was a month ago.  Maybe instead of attacking you, they should get your ex some help.", "NTA. Your son has a right to know and he may even have been helped by being able to mourn them with a community at the funeral. Your ex is the AH. Your ex was looking out for himself not your son. Your duty is to your son.", "NTA. It\u2019s easy for him to be this upset about it when he isn\u2019t the one that has to hear his son asking non-stop about his stepmom and brother \ud83d\ude44 3 months is too long to wait, in my opinion, but whatever.", "NTA - seeing as your ex disappeared for several months, you really had no choice. With your son being six you had some leeway here but you couldnt leave him in the dark for months.", "NTA \n\nHe pretty much ignored his son for 3 months. He shouldn't have shielded him from the situation, and if he wanted to be the one to share the news, he should have done it right away. His son knew something was up, and as you proved, once he knew he was able to move on.", "NTA\n\nYour son needed to know.  This isn't something your ex can just ignore.\n\nIt was reasonable for your ex to want to tell your son, but asking that your wait and let him tell creates the responsibility to tell him in a timely manner, and do the work of being a supportive parent to a grieving child.\n\nThe fact that your ex is grieving does not take away his responsibilities as a parent.  You can't just take time off from being a parent. It would have been reasonable for the father to say \"please hold off talking to him about this until I can come over tomorrow and explain myself.\"  It was not reasonable or appropriate to abandon the son in a limbo of ignorance for months.\n\nAnd your son had a right to attend the funeral.  To grieve with his loved ones.  To have the ritual to help him process the situation.  Taking that away from the son was wrong.\n\nGiven how long the father disappeared for, and how he failed to inform or support your son in this situation, you may want to reevaluate visitation schedules.  A parent who disappears from a child's life for months can't expect to just pick things up months later as if everything was normal.", "NTA.  Your son had already bonded with his to be born sibling.", "NTA, your son needs to grieve too and I don't think putting off telling him for so long would be helping him to do that, especially when he's this excited. Sounds like your ex is really struggling with the grieving too. So sorry for everyone's loss.", "NTA. You were put in an untenable position where you had to choose between your AWOL ex's preference and what was best for your son.  Telling your son helped him to understand that daddy and stepmom didn't abandon him once they had the new baby.  I can only imagine what dots he was connecting up until that point.\n\nYour ex is obviously still deep in the grieving process. The real AHs here are his family.  When your ex couldn't bring himself to see your son or break the news, it seems such a strange response and hurtful to all involved for his relatives to put the whole situation on blast.", "NTA. Yes, your ex is going through something very traumatic. But that doesn't mean you can just stop being a parent. It was unreasonable for him to leave you on read for MONTHS and to tell you you just can't tell your son anything. I would think that your son finally hearing the truth was infinitely better than him just assuming his dad was done with him. What were you supposed to do?", "When I read the first part, I was all set to say yes but honestly \n\nNTA\n\nYou gave him more than enough time to tell your son and unfortunately he didn't. You too were grieving and while not as much as he was, I am sure it was hard for you every time your son asked about the baby who passed away. It's unfair to your son that his father hasn't even reached out even to say hi to him. You picked up the slack and did the best thing. I get him wanting to tell his son but that was unfair to the two of you to wait months without a word.", "NTA. You respected his wishes but also understood that you can't just avoid that topic forever. It's unfair to your son. You had no idea how long your ex was going to ghost, and your son deserves to grieve as well. Kids do not understand this stuff, and if you don't fill them in, they will make up a story in their head to explain why he hasn't seen his family 3 months.\n\nI understand your ex needed to grieve that loss, but he and his family acted really unfairly.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a particularly difficult situation. You did your best to honor your ex's wishes, and even waited a considerable amount of time before divulging such sensitive information. It's not just his son; he's your boy too, and you had to make a tough decision when your ex failed to communicate with you for three months. \n\nLet them be upset. Ignore their messages. They're still grieving and probably have a lot of misplaced anger.", "NTA - It seems clear that the ex is too emotionally distraught to discuss this and it's not fair to the child.  Your ex needs some help to work through his grief.", "NTA, you have been very gracious about your ex and his grieving. He deserves time and space to heal, but that shouldn\u2019t mean ghosting his son and expecting you to lie for months.\n\nYou were put in a very difficult position and you did what\u2019s best for your son. Who knows how much longer your ex would want to wait and that can\u2019t be healthy for your son to not know the truth about his stepmom and brother indefinitely. Condolences to you and your family.", "NTA - Tricky decision that had to be made but he is your son and not exclusively your ex's. You have to be able to input into big things like this and three months is a long time to be without anything. He could have kept you waiting another three months for all you knew and you made the best decision you could.", "NTA.  It's terrible what happened to your ex, but his loss of a partner & their unborn child & does not negate his obligations to be a parent to your son.  You showed your ex a lot of grace while he is/was grieving this horrific loss.  Still, he cannot simply ghost you & your son, & then expect to pick things up exactly when/how he left off whenever he feels like coming back around; that's not how parenting works.  Your ex put you in a terrible position OP, & I think you handled this situation as thoughtfully & empathetically as you possibly could.", "NTA. Dude can\u2019t dip out on his son for months and just expect you to keep lying to the kid about why dad stopped coming around.", "NTA At All", "NTA. From the title alone, it sounded pretty bad but I was envisioning that it had been a few days and you jumped the gun. He completely disappeared for months. Your 6yo understands the passage of time and knew the baby would have been born long ago and I\u2019m sure was missing his dad. It\u2019s super unreasonable to expect you to let him worry for such a long time with no answers to his questions. I\u2019m surprised that even people in his family are agreeing that you\u2019re in the wrong. Do they think your son is like a doll that\u2019s inanimate when he\u2019s not being played with? He\u2019s a person with emotions of his own and needs that must be met, even when someone is going through a crisis.", "NTA, you did what was best for your son, and it appears to have been comforting for him to have answers.", "NTA.  He didn\u2019t just ghost you, he ghosted a 6 year old. For months.\n\nYour son needed to know that dad didn\u2019t just up and bail on him.", "The title had my hackles up - but your kids development would suffer if you DIDNT tell him. His dad suddenly disappearing. The promised brother. He clearly had questions and you delivered the news in an age appropriate way. Dads grief is clouding his judgment here. NTA", "NTA. Grieving doesn't mean parenting stops. WTF was he thinking by ghosting his 6 y/o son for MONTHS.  That's insane.  You did nothing wrong.  Anyone by his side should have told him to keep in contact with his child.", "NTA. Loss is so hard, and that is a devastating loss and your ex was understandably upset and grieving\u2026but he wasn\u2019t the only one. You don\u2019t get to stop being a parent when you\u2019re grieving and your child deserved to know why a huge chunk of his support system was no longer around. \n\nYou had no idea how long it was going to take him to contact you again and in the mean time your son noticed the absence and I\u2019m sure had a lot of feelings about that with no explanation. You did what you felt was best for your kid. Your ex disappeared for a few months from his child\u2019s life and left you to deal with any questions your son had. \n\nGrief is hard and nonlinear but as a parent what\u2019s best for you kind needs to be the focus.", "NTA, but definitely screenshot all of the posts and keep the texts just in case the toxicity doesn't pass with time.", "NTA. If he wanted to tell your son himself he should have at least communicated with you as to when he would do so. He cut ties with his own son for three months and expected you to just make up lies to for him?", "NTA.  No matter how badly he was grieving, your ex had no business demanding that you lie to your son about this.", "NTA. Your son needed to know. No doubt he knew something was wrong, and it\u2019s better you told him. Your responsibility is to your son, not your ex. It\u2019s understandable he\u2019s grieving but it doesn\u2019t mean he can ignore his kid. Focus on your son.", "NTA\n\nYou don't hide stuff like that for months and months.  Your son deserved the truth and you gave it to him.  If anything your ex is the asshole for holding out for all this time instead of stepping up and being there for his son who has also lost people they loved.", "NTA, he doesn\u2019t get to check out for months and disappear without a word. He has a child that was confused and abandoned. You waited longer than necessary and he should appreciate that.", "NTA. You respected his wishes to tell his son, but then he completely ghosted the boy. As much as he was hurting, it hurts a young child to left wondering what happened to his daddy. You did the only thing you could and addressed it directly. Your first obligation is to give your son the mother he needs and deserves. Everything else, even your ex\u2019s grief, comes after that. Anyone else who attacks you needs to be pointed to this post.", "NTA. You are the one living and taking care of your son and he is at an age where he understand things that are going on. To be completely blanked out of his father's life with no reason for 3 months is confusing enough but not knowing why is even worse. You gave your ex plenty of time and opportunity to explain it himself but he did not do it. Your child deserved to know the truth and if his father wasn't doing it, you are not an asshole for doing it yourself", "NTA, and you have patience and temperance that I admire.  I rage on your behalf.", "Nta he's a coward and shouldn't take it out on you leaving his son in limbo while u deal w the questions", "NTA. Your son needed information. Kids can only be placated so long. That time came and went. Your ex was grieving.. understandably. But his son still needed parenting", "NTA. Yes he is grieving. But that doesn't mean he can just abandon his son. Six is old enough to know something is wrong. It's cruel to keep the kid in the dark for months. You are doing your best.", "NTA. Your kid comes first and always should. He made the decision to cut contact and leave your kid asking questions for too long. You did the right thing as a parent. I understand why your ex wanted to explain to your son, but he left it too long and that\u2019s on him and it\u2019s not your fault that it happened this way. I hope he and your son are able to heal from this and that your relationship with your ex isn\u2019t harmed in the long run", "NTA your son had a right to know, it had been months!! I get your ex wanting to tell him but your son is only 6 years old. He needed to know why his dad was absent. You did what needed to be done.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA, you\u2019re looking out for your child here and with it having been months of no contact about the direction of this situation you were put in the position of making a decision. It sounds like you\u2019re doing the best in a bad situation and the other side of the family are dealing with a true tragedy. Unfortunately it seems like you\u2019re getting the short end of the stick. \n\nKeep your head up and stay strong for your family.", "I'm sorry for the loss you and your family had to go through. I can imagine that this was a very tough time overall. \n\nI personally don't think you are an asshole because I don't think his father was right to not tell him and include him in the grieving process.  Parents often think they can shield their child from such experiences, or don't want to share their grief. But in those times it's best to grieve as a family. No matter how hard it is. \n\nYou saw how this affected your own son and you felt that he was able to understand. And as you were right, knowing what happened allowed him to understand and not take anything personal. You wanted to prevent your child from starting to think that his father might find his new family more important and that there was no space for him there. \n\nI believe you did the right thing. And while his father gets to be mad, you did what was best for your child. That said, I can only encourage not to go into any fights. These times are hard enough. Shrugg of the insults, don't insult back. In those times of grief nothing good can ever come out of this. You did what's best for your son, remind yourself of that.   \n\n\nBest luck to you and your family.   \n\n\n(NTA for the stats)", "Absolutely NTA. What your ex asked if you was completely unacceptable. A reasonable amount of time here is days not months.", "NTA\u2026in any way\u2026 children come first and their feelings and understanding of the world is up to us as parents\u2026 dropping the ball can cause serious issues later on\u2026 that kid deserved to know when it happened and been allowed to grieve WITH his father\u2026you don\u2019t ghost a six year old\u2026 especially in a situation that could very well dictate the relationship you have with them for the rest of your life", "NTA. Loss is hard and grief is absolutely painful when you lose someone you love. But your son deserved to know. It wasn't fair for his dad to just leave him in the dark. Because at some point he's likely going to ask when they passed and why he wasn't told right away and why his dad didn't want him at the funeral. You did the right thing for your son, and your ex and his family can just be mad if they want. It won't change that your son deserved answers and closure just as much as anyone else. Please be gentle with yourself, you did nothing wrong whatsoever.", "NTA I understand needing space but he doesn\u2019t just get to ghost his son for months and expect you to cater to him regardless. Your son needed answers.", "NTA. Usually I would say yes it\u2019s the dads job to talk about his partner and unborn child BUT he didn\u2019t. He disappeared. That\u2019s no reasonable. And I\u2019m saying this as a person who literally went into hiding after my dad died and stayed inside for months. It\u2019s been two years and I\u2019m still a hermit, but the difference here is that I DONT HAVE A HUMAN CHILD to look after. All that happened is that I updated people on me being still alive and that\u2019s it. I cannot imagine leaving a little kid to wonder what the heck was happening, because although grief is unbelievably hard and upsetting for me, there\u2019s a little boy that needed me. You don\u2019t get to just disappear on a child, no matter what. \n\nIt was way past time that he was told, your ex made you lie to him until you decided enough was enough. That\u2019s not fair either. Instead of your ex having his kid there and then being able to find comfort in themselves, he left his kid without telling him a thing. I feel so bad for your little boy, poor kid is going to be so confused by his dad leaving. I\u2019m glad he has you and your husband to take care of him", "NTA\n\nI understand your ex is grieving but he is not acting rationally.\n\nNot telling a child that his stepmother and the baby died for 4 months is not the actions of someone with a grip on reality.\n\nHis siblings are TA because they should be thinking about their brother and nephew instead of piling onto you. \n\nNAH but his family.", "NTA. I would *seriously* also question your ex's ability to parent your son unless and until he gets into grief counseling. It is completely unnatural to refuse to even contact your living child for 4 months. Like, I would be concerned that he would unalive himself and the living child.", "Nta.

Someday your ex may even be grateful that he didn\u2019t have to have that conversation with your son.

This was a horrible situation. I know that grief can sometimes cause people to do and say terrible things. While I understand your ex may have wanted to be the one to tell him, he was left unable to do so. That poor child needed answers. Imagine the thoughts that may have been running through his mind IE: \"My daddy doesn't want me anymore.\" Family members that are calling and cursing you out are behaving abhorrent. Quite frankly, grieving or not, your ex was still a parent. He had a responsibility to his child. He disappeared. This isn't ok. You have had to handle everything on your own, and you were given no grace, compassion, or understanding. Your ex suddenly calls and demands time after disappearing is also ridiculous and confusing for his child.

His entire family is ripping me to shreds and I don\u2019t understand. So my ex and I have a son together who is six. We split up when he was one and things were messy at first but have been peaceful for the past four years or so. We\u2019ve both moved on and entered two relationships. His girlfriend he\u2019s been with since the beginning of 2022 is such a kind woman and always went out of her way to befriend me which was nice. When they announced their pregnancy everyone was pleasantly surprised but it was pretty soon after his latest breakup so his family didn\u2019t like her which I found odd since that\u2019s not her fault. But I digress. \n\nSadly she passed away in childbirth and the baby also passed as well in November of 2022. It was extremely heartbreaking, I cried and grieved her loss as well. My ex understandably had his entire earth shattered and was going through one of the worst times of his life so I completely understood him needing time to not be a parent and didn\u2019t have any issues with that. He didn\u2019t reply to any of my messages except to say he didn\u2019t want our son to know as he was excited to have a little brother and wants to be the one to tell him and that was in November. He also didn\u2019t want our son to attend the funeral. I completely understood and didn\u2019t tell my son expecting my ex to keep his word. \n\nIn December I still heard no word from him regarding our son or coparenting situation. I completely understood he needed time and waited. In January still no word. . My husband said that even with what happened he should at least call or FaceTime if he can\u2019t do in person parenting and I agree. I reached out to his parents then and they said that they are willing to \u201cparent\u201d their grandson while their son grieves. My son is six, he\u2019s old enough to understand some things. He\u2019s been asking non stop about his dad and little brother and when he\u2019s going to meet them. I had told them that they were very busy and daddy would come see him soon to let him know but I can only use that excuse for so long.\n\n I did tell him in the beginning of February the truth, that his stepmom passed away and so did the baby and that they are in heaven and that daddy is sad and needs time to rest and feel better. That actually really helped him understand and he stopped asking and instead was drawing pictures to cheer his dad up. Yesterday he messaged me for the first time in months saying he wants to see our son for HIS birthday (my ex not my sons) which is next weekend and he wants to explain everything then. I told him since he went ghost on me since November I told our son earlier in the month since he wouldn\u2019t stop asking and he needed answers. He started cursing at me saying I\u2019m a bitch and asshole and that he it wasn\u2019t my place to tell him and that I \u201ctook that away from him\u201d. He hung and now his siblings and parents are posting subs at me online and calling me and texting me saying the same. AITA??\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

MONTHS, he went radio silent on the living child he had and now suddenly he wants him on his birthday, as if he's second choice.", "NTA.  Your poor son has been in the dark for so long. Ex should have reached out a LOT sooner", "ESH.  Dad shouldn't wait months to tell the kid. You should have given Dad a heads up that kiddo needed the truth before going ahead and telling the news.", "Grief and trauma do some weird things to a person, so I\u2019m not prepared to say the ex is an AH. But he\u2019s on the path to becoming one if he doesn\u2019t get himself together soon. He\u2019s clearly not doing well, and if I were OP I\u2019d want to make sure he\u2019s been receiving mental health care before I let him watch their kid by himself.", "I would bet that the family heard a very different story about what happened. It\u2019s the only reasonable explanation I can think of why any sane person would agree with what was happening.", "A reasonable time to tell your child that his family died is hours not months. I figured the dad was doing paperwork stuff, and the mom blurted it out by the title. \n\nNot that he abandoned his living child and then tried to control a terrible narrative for 4-5 months.", "This is possibly over cautious, but I don't think you should leave your son alone with his dad at the moment.\n\nIt isn't safe.", "Genuine question. Why \"unalive\" and not \"kill\"? It's not like murder-suicide is palatable if you use different words, is there another reason for it that I'm missing? Seeing this a lot lately when I feel like I never did before.", "This! What cruel thing to do! \n\nNTA", "Agreed", "I understand he was grieving, but you do not abandon the child you already have for several months. He should have at least kept in some sort of contact with his son/ex. You don\u2019t stop being a parent when you lose one of your children.", "I don't think she was OK but it's not like you can force someone to parent their kid if they just go silent and disengage. His parents also stepped in to be \"parents\" while their son completely checked out on his other child and didn't even tell the poor kid he'd lost his long awaited brother", "I don't think she was okay with it. She was being understanding and she literally says that she reached out his parents in December (one month after it happened) and they said they would parent. What is she supposed to do? force a grieving man to still talk to his child when he won't even speak to her?", "How was she supposed to give dad a heads up when he ghosted her?", "Not knowing their situation I\u2019ll give them days. Not knowing how far apart the deaths were, and allowing time for dad to do the paperwork, make arrangements, and then travel to son/have son travel to him. I get dad wanting to tell son personally. But this was completely out of line. I can\u2019t believe Mom waited more than a week. Seems like Dad is very unstable.", "Some places censor that word in comments. Not here, but the commenter is being careful because there\u2019s a \u201cno violence\u201d rule here.", "Right. I can see a day or two, if the parent needs to get themselves together enough to not traumatize the kid with the conversation. But it\u2019s been more than three months now. The son deserved to know why he suddenly wasn\u2019t able to see half of his family.", "Yes, this."]}
