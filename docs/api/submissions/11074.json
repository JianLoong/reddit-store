His entire family is ripping me to shreds and I don\u2019t understand. So my ex and I have a son together who is six.

My ex understandably had his entire earth shattered and was going through one of the worst times of his life so I completely understood him needing time to not be a parent and didn\u2019t have any issues with that. He didn\u2019t reply to any of my messages except to say he didn\u2019t want our son to know as he was excited to have a little brother and wants to be the one to tell him and that was in November. He also didn\u2019t want our son to attend the funeral. I completely understood and didn\u2019t tell my son expecting my ex to keep his word. \n\nIn December I still heard no word from him regarding our son or coparenting situation. I completely understood he needed time and waited. In January still no word. . My husband said that even with what happened he should at least call or FaceTime if he can\u2019t do in person parenting and I agree. I reached out to his parents then and they said that they are willing to \u201cparent\u201d their grandson while their son grieves. My son is six, he\u2019s old enough to understand some things. He\u2019s been asking non stop about his dad and little brother and when he\u2019s going to meet them. I had told them that they were very busy and daddy would come see him soon to let him know but I can only use that excuse for so long.\n\n I did tell him in the beginning of February the truth, that his stepmom passed away and so did the baby and that they are in heaven and that daddy is sad and needs time to rest and feel better. That actually really helped him understand and he stopped asking and instead was drawing pictures to cheer his dad up. Yesterday he messaged me for the first time in months saying he wants to see our son for HIS birthday (my ex not my sons) which is next weekend and he wants to explain everything then. I told him since he went ghost on me since November I told our son earlier in the month since he wouldn\u2019t stop asking and he needed answers. He started cursing at me saying I\u2019m a bitch and asshole and that it wasn\u2019t my place to tell him and that I \u201ctook that away from him\u201d. He hung up and now his siblings and parents are posting subs at me online and calling me and texting me saying the same.

Your son is six and had no idea why he wasn't getting to see his dad, stepmom, and baby brother. You couldn't keep making excuses and lying to him. I can only imagine how it would feel to a six year old to keep hearing that his father is too busy to see him.", "NTA. came fully ready to say you were, but the period of time between when it happened and when you told him was enough that it was negatively affecting your son. Tbh, your ex is an AH for depriving your son of ***his own*** grieving process and not letting him attend the funeral. He lost someone too, and his father denied him his own experience.   \n\n\nDad needs to learn not everything is about him. You \"took that away from\" fully implies that how he wanted to tell the son (including waiting so long) was all about **his own** grieving process, and wasn't centered on the son's needs even a little bit. Dad wasn't looking out for your kids needs, you were.", "NTA. He should have taken care of that himself in the first week or two. He left it for 3 MONTHS. People, including kids, deserve better than that.", "NTA - I am so sorry that all of you have been going through this.  You have gone above and beyond to help your ex cope with his grief, but you have to do what is best for your son.  Your child and his well-being need to be your first priority - above that of his father.\n\nTo put it very bluntly, it's been 3 months since your son saw his father in person, which is not okay.  I understand that your ex is grieving, however it's not fair to your son that he got put aside with no explanation for such a long period of time.  \n\n3 months is also excessive for not telling your son about the death of his step-mom and baby sibling.  He's 6, so he's in elementary school, and well able to understand what's happened, even if it's just on a basic level.  It sounds like you did an excellent job of breaking the news.  Yes, I get that it wasn't your news to tell, but to your point, you can't make an excuse forever.  Your son knows the baby was supposed to come 3 months ago, so where's the baby?  \n\nAs for your ex's family, I'd simply tell them that you gave him months to tell your son.  He didn't.  He hasn't even seen your son in person.  After 2 months had passed, you finally told your son the truth.  That was a month ago.  Maybe instead of attacking you, they should get your ex some help.", "NTA. Your son has a right to know and he may even have been helped by being able to mourn them with a community at the funeral. Your ex is the AH. Your ex was looking out for himself not your son. Your duty is to your son.", "NTA. It\u2019s easy for him to be this upset about it when he isn\u2019t the one that has to hear his son asking non-stop about his stepmom and brother \ud83d\ude44 3 months is too long to wait, in my opinion, but whatever.", "NTA - seeing as your ex disappeared for several months, you really had no choice. With your son being six you had some leeway here but you couldnt leave him in the dark for months.", "NTA \n\nHe pretty much ignored his son for 3 months. He shouldn't have shielded him from the situation, and if he wanted to be the one to share the news, he should have done it right away. His son knew something was up, and as you proved, once he knew he was able to move on.", "NTA\n\nYour son needed to know.  This isn't something your ex can just ignore.\n\nIt was reasonable for your ex to want to tell your son, but asking that your wait and let him tell creates the responsibility to tell him in a timely manner, and do the work of being a supportive parent to a grieving child.\n\nThe fact that your ex is grieving does not take away his responsibilities as a parent.  You can't just take time off from being a parent. It would have been reasonable for the father to say \"please hold off talking to him about this until I can come over tomorrow and explain myself.\"  It was not reasonable or appropriate to abandon the son in a limbo of ignorance for months.\n\nAnd your son had a right to attend the funeral.  To grieve with his loved ones.  To have the ritual to help him process the situation.  Taking that away from the son was wrong.\n\nGiven how long the father disappeared for, and how he failed to inform or support your son in this situation, you may want to reevaluate visitation schedules.  A parent who disappears from a child's life for months can't expect to just pick things up months later as if everything was normal.", "NTA.  Your son had already bonded with his to be born sibling.", "NTA, your son needs to grieve too and I don't think putting off telling him for so long would be helping him to do that, especially when he's this excited. Sounds like your ex is really struggling with the grieving too. So sorry for everyone's loss.", "NTA. You were put in an untenable position where you had to choose between your AWOL ex's preference and what was best for your son.  Telling your son helped him to understand that daddy and stepmom didn't abandon him once they had the new baby.  I can only imagine what dots he was connecting up until that point.\n\nYour ex is obviously still deep in the grieving process. The real AHs here are his family.  When your ex couldn't bring himself to see your son or break the news, it seems such a strange response and hurtful to all involved for his relatives to put the whole situation on blast.", "NTA. Yes, your ex is going through something very traumatic. But that doesn't mean you can just stop being a parent. It was unreasonable for him to leave you on read for MONTHS and to tell you you just can't tell your son anything. I would think that your son finally hearing the truth was infinitely better than him just assuming his dad was done with him. What were you supposed to do?", "When I read the first part, I was all set to say yes but honestly \n\nNTA\n\nYou gave him more than enough time to tell your son and unfortunately he didn't. You too were grieving and while not as much as he was, I am sure it was hard for you every time your son asked about the baby who passed away. It's unfair to your son that his father hasn't even reached out even to say hi to him. You picked up the slack and did the best thing. I get him wanting to tell his son but that was unfair to the two of you to wait months without a word.", "NTA. You respected his wishes but also understood that you can't just avoid that topic forever. It's unfair to your son. You had no idea how long your ex was going to ghost, and your son deserves to grieve as well. Kids do not understand this stuff, and if you don't fill them in, they will make up a story in their head to explain why he hasn't seen his family 3 months.\n\nI understand your ex needed to grieve that loss, but he and his family acted really unfairly.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a particularly difficult situation. You did your best to honor your ex's wishes, and even waited a considerable amount of time before divulging such sensitive information. It's not just his son; he's your boy too, and you had to make a tough decision when your ex failed to communicate with you for three months. \n\nLet them be upset. Ignore their messages. They're still grieving and probably have a lot of misplaced anger.", "NTA - It seems clear that the ex is too emotionally distraught to discuss this and it's not fair to the child.  Your ex needs some help to work through his grief.", "NTA, you have been very gracious about your ex and his grieving. He deserves time and space to heal, but that shouldn\u2019t mean ghosting his son and expecting you to lie for months.\n\nYou were put in a very difficult position and you did what\u2019s best for your son. Who knows how much longer your ex would want to wait and that can\u2019t be healthy for your son to not know the truth about his stepmom and brother indefinitely. Condolences to you and your family.", "NTA - Tricky decision that had to be made but he is your son and not exclusively your ex's. You have to be able to input into big things like this and three months is a long time to be without anything. He could have kept you waiting another three months for all you knew and you made the best decision you could.", "NTA.  It's terrible what happened to your ex, but his loss of a partner & their unborn child & does not negate his obligations to be a parent to your son.  You showed your ex a lot of grace while he is/was grieving this horrific loss.  Still, he cannot simply ghost you & your son, & then expect to pick things up exactly when/how he left off whenever he feels like coming back around; that's not how parenting works.  Your ex put you in a terrible position OP, & I think you handled this situation as thoughtfully & empathetically as you possibly could.", "NTA. Dude can\u2019t dip out on his son for months and just expect you to keep lying to the kid about why dad stopped coming around.", "NTA At All", "NTA. From the title alone, it sounded pretty bad but I was envisioning that it had been a few days and you jumped the gun. He completely disappeared for months. Your 6yo understands the passage of time and knew the baby would have been born long ago and I\u2019m sure was missing his dad. It\u2019s super unreasonable to expect you to let him worry for such a long time with no answers to his questions. I\u2019m surprised that even people in his family are agreeing that you\u2019re in the wrong. Do they think your son is like a doll that\u2019s inanimate when he\u2019s not being played with? He\u2019s a person with emotions of his own and needs that must be met, even when someone is going through a crisis.", "NTA, you did what was best for your son, and it appears to have been comforting for him to have answers.", "NTA.  He didn\u2019t just ghost you, he ghosted a 6 year old. For months.\n\nYour son needed to know that dad didn\u2019t just up and bail on him.", "The title had my hackles up - but your kids development would suffer if you DIDNT tell him. His dad suddenly disappearing. The promised brother. He clearly had questions and you delivered the news in an age appropriate way. Dads grief is clouding his judgment here. NTA", "NTA. Grieving doesn't mean parenting stops. WTF was he thinking by ghosting his 6 y/o son for MONTHS.  That's insane.  You did nothing wrong.  Anyone by his side should have told him to keep in contact with his child.", "NTA. Loss is so hard, and that is a devastating loss and your ex was understandably upset and grieving\u2026but he wasn\u2019t the only one. You don\u2019t get to stop being a parent when you\u2019re grieving and your child deserved to know why a huge chunk of his support system was no longer around. \n\nYou had no idea how long it was going to take him to contact you again and in the mean time your son noticed the absence and I\u2019m sure had a lot of feelings about that with no explanation. You did what you felt was best for your kid. Your ex disappeared for a few months from his child\u2019s life and left you to deal with any questions your son had. \n\nGrief is hard and nonlinear but as a parent what\u2019s best for you kind needs to be the focus.", "NTA, but definitely screenshot all of the posts and keep the texts just in case the toxicity doesn't pass with time.", "NTA. If he wanted to tell your son himself he should have at least communicated with you as to when he would do so. He cut ties with his own son for three months and expected you to just make up lies to for him?", "NTA.  No matter how badly he was grieving, your ex had no business demanding that you lie to your son about this.", "NTA. Your son needed to know. No doubt he knew something was wrong, and it\u2019s better you told him. Your responsibility is to your son, not your ex. It\u2019s understandable he\u2019s grieving but it doesn\u2019t mean he can ignore his kid. Focus on your son.", "NTA\n\nYou don't hide stuff like that for months and months.  Your son deserved the truth and you gave it to him.  If anything your ex is the asshole for holding out for all this time instead of stepping up and being there for his son who has also lost people they loved.", "NTA, he doesn\u2019t get to check out for months and disappear without a word. He has a child that was confused and abandoned. You waited longer than necessary and he should appreciate that.", "NTA. You respected his wishes to tell his son, but then he completely ghosted the boy. As much as he was hurting, it hurts a young child to left wondering what happened to his daddy. You did the only thing you could and addressed it directly. Your first obligation is to give your son the mother he needs and deserves. Everything else, even your ex\u2019s grief, comes after that. Anyone else who attacks you needs to be pointed to this post.", "NTA. You are the one living and taking care of your son and he is at an age where he understand things that are going on. To be completely blanked out of his father's life with no reason for 3 months is confusing enough but not knowing why is even worse. You gave your ex plenty of time and opportunity to explain it himself but he did not do it. Your child deserved to know the truth and if his father wasn't doing it, you are not an asshole for doing it yourself", "NTA, and you have patience and temperance that I admire.  I rage on your behalf.", "Nta he's a coward and shouldn't take it out on you leaving his son in limbo while u deal w the questions", "NTA. Your son needed information. Kids can only be placated so long. That time came and went. Your ex was grieving.. understandably. But his son still needed parenting", "NTA. Yes he is grieving. But that doesn't mean he can just abandon his son. Six is old enough to know something is wrong. It's cruel to keep the kid in the dark for months. You are doing your best.", "NTA. Your kid comes first and always should. He made the decision to cut contact and leave your kid asking questions for too long. You did the right thing as a parent. I understand why your ex wanted to explain to your son, but he left it too long and that\u2019s on him and it\u2019s not your fault that it happened this way. I hope he and your son are able to heal from this and that your relationship with your ex isn\u2019t harmed in the long run", "NTA your son had a right to know, it had been months!! I get your ex wanting to tell him but your son is only 6 years old. He needed to know why his dad was absent. You did what needed to be done.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA, you\u2019re looking out for your child here and with it having been months of no contact about the direction of this situation you were put in the position of making a decision. It sounds like you\u2019re doing the best in a bad situation and the other side of the family are dealing with a true tragedy. Unfortunately it seems like you\u2019re getting the short end of the stick. \n\nKeep your head up and stay strong for your family.", "I'm sorry for the loss you and your family had to go through. I can imagine that this was a very tough time overall. \n\nI personally don't think you are an asshole because I don't think his father was right to not tell him and include him in the grieving process.  Parents often think they can shield their child from such experiences, or don't want to share their grief. But in those times it's best to grieve as a family. No matter how hard it is. \n\nYou saw how this affected your own son and you felt that he was able to understand. And as you were right, knowing what happened allowed him to understand and not take anything personal. You wanted to prevent your child from starting to think that his father might find his new family more important and that there was no space for him there. \n\nI believe you did the right thing. And while his father gets to be mad, you did what was best for your child. That said, I can only encourage not to go into any fights. These times are hard enough. Shrugg of the insults, don't insult back. In those times of grief nothing good can ever come out of this. You did what's best for your son, remind yourself of that.   \n\n\nBest luck to you and your family.   \n\n\n(NTA for the stats)", "Absolutely NTA.

A reasonable amount of time here is days not months.", "NTA\u2026in any way\u2026 children come first and their feelings and understanding of the world is up to us as parents\u2026 dropping the ball can cause serious issues later on\u2026 that kid deserved to know when it happened and been allowed to grieve WITH his father\u2026you don\u2019t ghost a six year old\u2026 especially in a situation that could very well dictate the relationship you have with them for the rest of your life", "NTA. Loss is hard and grief is absolutely painful when you lose someone you love. But your son deserved to know. It wasn't fair for his dad to just leave him in the dark. Because at some point he's likely going to ask when they passed and why he wasn't told right away and why his dad didn't want him at the funeral. You did the right thing for your son, and your ex and his family can just be mad if they want. It won't change that your son deserved answers and closure just as much as anyone else. Please be gentle with yourself, you did nothing wrong whatsoever.", "NTA I understand needing space but he doesn\u2019t just get to ghost his son for months and expect you to cater to him regardless. Your son needed answers.", "NTA. Usually I would say yes it\u2019s the dads job to talk about his partner and unborn child BUT he didn\u2019t. He disappeared. That\u2019s no reasonable. And I\u2019m saying this as a person who literally went into hiding after my dad died and stayed inside for months. It\u2019s been two years and I\u2019m still a hermit, but the difference here is that I DONT HAVE A HUMAN CHILD to look after. All that happened is that I updated people on me being still alive and that\u2019s it. I cannot imagine leaving a little kid to wonder what the heck was happening, because although grief is unbelievably hard and upsetting for me, there\u2019s a little boy that needed me. You don\u2019t get to just disappear on a child, no matter what. \n\nIt was way past time that he was told, your ex made you lie to him until you decided enough was enough. That\u2019s not fair either. Instead of your ex having his kid there and then being able to find comfort in themselves, he left his kid without telling him a thing. I feel so bad for your little boy, poor kid is going to be so confused by his dad leaving. I\u2019m glad he has you and your husband to take care of him", "NTA\n\nI understand your ex is grieving but he is not acting rationally.\n\nNot telling a child that his stepmother and the baby died for 4 months is not the actions of someone with a grip on reality.\n\nHis siblings are TA because they should be thinking about their brother and nephew instead of piling onto you. \n\nNAH but his family.", "NTA.

Someday your ex may even be grateful that he didn\u2019t have to have that conversation with your son.

Imagine the thoughts that may have been running through his mind IE: \"My daddy doesn't want me anymore.\" Family members that are calling and cursing you out are behaving abhorrent. Quite frankly, grieving or not, your ex was still a parent. He had a responsibility to his child. He disappeared. This isn't ok. You have had to handle everything on your own, and you were given no grace, compassion, or understanding.

His entire family is ripping me to shreds and I don\u2019t understand. So my ex and I have a son together who is six. We split up when he was one and things were messy at first but have been peaceful for the past four years or so. We\u2019ve both moved on and entered two relationships. His girlfriend he\u2019s been with since the beginning of 2022 is such a kind woman and always went out of her way to befriend me which was nice. When they announced their pregnancy everyone was pleasantly surprised but it was pretty soon after his latest breakup so his family didn\u2019t like her which I found odd since that\u2019s not her fault. But I digress. \n\nSadly she passed away in childbirth and the baby also passed as well in November of 2022. It was extremely heartbreaking, I cried and grieved her loss as well. My ex understandably had his entire earth shattered and was going through one of the worst times of his life so I completely understood him needing time to not be a parent and didn\u2019t have any issues with that. He didn\u2019t reply to any of my messages except to say he didn\u2019t want our son to know as he was excited to have a little brother and wants to be the one to tell him and that was in November. He also didn\u2019t want our son to attend the funeral. I completely understood and didn\u2019t tell my son expecting my ex to keep his word. \n\nIn December I still heard no word from him regarding our son or coparenting situation.

My husband said that even with what happened he should at least call or FaceTime if he can\u2019t do in person parenting and I agree. I reached out to his parents then and they said that they are willing to \u201cparent\u201d their grandson while their son grieves. My son is six, he\u2019s old enough to understand some things. He\u2019s been asking non stop about his dad and little brother and when he\u2019s going to meet them. I had told them that they were very busy and daddy would come see him soon to let him know but I can only use that excuse for so long.\n\n I did tell him in the beginning of February the truth, that his stepmom passed away and so did the baby and that they are in heaven and that daddy is sad and needs time to rest and feel better. That actually really helped him understand and he stopped asking and instead was drawing pictures to cheer his dad up. Yesterday he messaged me for the first time in months saying he wants to see our son for HIS birthday (my ex not my sons) which is next weekend and he wants to explain everything then. I told him since he went ghost on me since November I told our son earlier in the month since he wouldn\u2019t stop asking and he needed answers. He started cursing at me saying I\u2019m a bitch and asshole and that he it wasn\u2019t my place to tell him and that I \u201ctook that away from him\u201d. He hung and now his siblings and parents are posting subs at me online and calling me and texting me saying the same. AITA??\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He couldn\u2019t; thats why you co-parent.", "NTA\n\nDad had months to pony up and essentially ghosted this poor kid.", "NTA and he and his family are AH\u2019s", "NTA. It's been MONTHS. That's WAY past the point dad needs to get past things enough to figure out how to communicate the loss to his kid.", "Strong NTA. You sound like a lovely, level-headed, compassionate person \u2013 and an awesome mom!", "You are also the parent. In the absence of his father you had every right , and in fact a responsibility, to explain to YOUR son information he needed. It\u2019s part of his development. You are a great mom for seeing that. Dad will get over it. He\u2019s still fresh in his grief. Just be understanding of his reactions. He obviously does not process emotion well.", "NTA. That\u2019s a big loss and I feel for your ex but that\u2019s still not an excuse to ghost your child for months. That\u2019s abandonment. I can imagine how confusing it was for your son to think his dad disappeared because he was busy with his brother. I\u2019m glad your son got to know the truth - he was also central to that trauma and loss and deserved to know.", "NTA. You gave him MONTHS to tell your son.", "NTA\n\nIt's awful that your ex is going through such an unimaginable tragedy. With that said, he did ghost his son and you for 3 months. You didn't have a choice. You had to tell your child the truth. Your ex and former in-laws should be thankful instead of attacking you.", "NTA - really sad situation and sorry for the loss. The little guy is 6, and unfortunately part of growing up is understanding how the world really works. It would have been better he learned sooner than later and been at the funeral.", "NTA\nAs horrible as this was for your ex, leaving his son in the dark like this, it's not right. I'm not a therapist or an expert, but I would feel that your ex's behavior is damaging to your child. Your child thought that his dad was busy with the new baby, so busy that he couldn't see him for 3 months. Instead, there's no baby, no stepmom and his dad has been gone for 3 months. If that won't feel like a betrayal and abandonment, then I don't know what is.\n\nWhen my mother passed away last year, I didn't hide my grief from my almost 3 year old. He attended the funeral and while he's not in the same developmental space as a 6 year old, we included him on his own terms.", "WTF??? What was your ex thinking?\n\nNTA. I wouldn't have waited that long although I probably would have laid down the law and some serious ultimatums before telling my son.", "You had me in the first half! But NTA. You were painted into a corner and chose to be honest with your kid and he\u2019s dealing with that age appropriately by drawing pictures, so he understands what\u2019s happening and thinking about it. That\u2019s awesome, job well done on breaking death to a child in a very healthy way. Your ex is still grieving and did not handle any of this well. \n\nI want to say NAH but his handling it and the words he called you were uncalled for. This is a tough situation and you took care of your baby first. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour obligation is to your son, and your son needed to know. You waited as long as you could, and lying to your son further could have harmed his sense of reality and his trust in you and his father. \n\nYour son needed to know before his father was ready to tell him. That's the simple truth. \n\nIt's a terrible, terrible thing that happened, and I hope that through the pain, everyone involved can grant you a little more grace and trust that you were simply trying to navigate an untenable situation to cause the least amount of harm to your son. \n\nYour ex, well, he's an adult. He needs to think about his son before himself. He can *still* have his talk. Nothing was taken from him.\n\nMy heartfelt condolences go out to all of you.", "My 5 and 8 year old grandsons went to my mother\u2019s funeral. They understood that their great grandmother is gone and they were actually little angels at the service. It was very unfair for ex to keep all of that away from the boy. Mom, you did a great job explaining and NTA.", "Nta. Honestly I think its best you did it. In time he will realize that. I've recently lost my best friend, and I have been dealing with grief around my young kids ( 4 and 6]. They don't fully grasp what's going on and they still want business as usual. Its Honestly better for you to prepare your son and answer questions than your ex. Likeee your ex could have told him, and your son might not have fully grasped what happened. Your ex would have his heart ripped out while explaining, and rhen again for several weeks after when your son either asked when his gf was coming home and he'd have to do it again,  or he would have just been asking questions that hurt for months. Your son has just been clueless where all these people he loved has gone and yeah- he needed to know. Your ex needs support right now from wveryone in his life and you were indeed giving him support", "N t a .... you did the right thing.", "NTA. He\u2019s still grieving so I\u2019d show him grace on his reaction. However he gets none for ghosting his child. It\u2019s so ridiculous that men think they can tap out of parenting. Yes he had two major losses. You still take care of your child. \n\nHad that have been you, you would have still been a parent to your child. You don\u2019t get a break from being a parent.", "NTA\n\nYour ex husband abandoned his son in his grief. He doesn't get to make parenting choices if he doesn't act like a f***ing parent and do difficult parent things.\n\nIt's also horrifically cruel to lie to a kid for months about a dead brother and stepmom just because dad can't handle his bag. Your ex was wrong and inconceivably selfish about how to handle this from the start, and he has likely done significant harm to your poor son.\n\nHe should be ashamed of himself, and already investing in therapy for the son he ghosted.", "Your ex ghosted your six year old little boy, and expected you to lie to him and say Daddy was just too busy for three months to call or visit. That could seriously harm your child, and convince him his father doesn\u2019t care about him.\n\nYou were under no obligation to agree to keep any secrets from, or lie to, your child. What you say to your child is your decision, as a mother.\n\nYou\u2019re right that by explaining his father was grieving, your son had an explanation for his absence besides simply not wanting to see him.\n\nAlso, she was a girlfriend, not a stepmother, if I understand correctly. It sounds like your ex does not have his act together, getting someone he\u2019s not married to pregnant right after a breakup, and then ghosting his six year old little boy when he lost her and their newborn. Sounds like he\u2019s planning, ahead of time, to miss his boy\u2019s seventh birthday while he continues to focus on himself. Not a man who would fight tigers for his child, apparently.\n\nNTA. You do not require the approval of your ex, or your ex\u2019s in laws, in how you help your son through this. Their opinions are immaterial. \n\nYour former in-laws are not your child\u2019s parents, and have no parental rights to your child. Their attacking you was inappropriate. \n\nDo you have a divorce agreement with custody spelled out? Document how many times your ex failed to call or see your child. Get it in writing, such as through texts and emails, which you save. Same texts and emails in which he disparages you. You have no idea if your relationship will remain cordial, so be prepared. Does this man have shared custody of your son, or visitation? He sounds really callous and irresponsible. \n\nYour husband is an adult. An adult shows up for his kids no matter what he\u2019s going through. Throwing one child away because he\u2019s grieving for another harms that child.", "NTA. That child was feeling abandoned and needed to know so as not to resent his dad ghosting him.", "NTA. You held out longer than I would have. That poor little boy deserved better from his dad. To leave him hanging for 3 months? His own son? Nope. You\u2019ve done absolutely nothing wrong.", "NTA. He is still a parent regardless of his loss. His son has had a huge loss also and deserved to know. You did the right thing by your child.", "NTA! I can\u2019t imagine having to string my child along and basically lie, giving them hope that they are still going to meet their baby brother soon, knowing full well he never will. You respected his wishes as long as possible, but at a certain point you can\u2019t keep it up. The way his dad handled this situation completely disregards the mounting excitement and anticipation this poor 6 year old would have had every day, in addition to the disappointment and lack of understanding of why you\u2019re not seeing your parent for months or the holidays. It\u2019s not like he went on pause until his dad was ready to talk about it. The longer a kid looks forward to something, the more disappointing it becomes when it doesn\u2019t happen. I\u2019m sure he knew it would be hard to talk about and didn\u2019t feel he could handle your son\u2019s reaction on top of his own devastation. But that\u2019s not really an adequate excuse. If his relatives are so mad about it, maybe they should have done more to help. It\u2019s so easy to be mad when you\u2019re not the one lying to a poor little kid every day. I\u2019m mad for you and your son\u2026", "You were right in doing it, so that he understands why some things have changed. He\u2019s your child, you did what was best for him. Also soared your ex from telling this all over again.", "NTA. Dad abandoned his son for months, and the poor kid was understandably worried and confused. Someone needed to tell him. It wasn't like you found out and immediately told your son. You gave dad more than enough time to explain, and he didn't.", "NTA he understandably was grieving but he still abandoned his living child for over two months. You were doing to right thing for the child.", "NTA.", "NTA. I would file for full custody after my child\u2019s father abandoned him for 2-3 months. He is clearly not fit to parent - regardless of his grief.", "NTA \n\nI was so like WTF until I got to how long he dragged this out. \n\nOnly thing I'd say you could have done differently is give the final \"It's been too long, if you don't come tell him by X Date, then on Y date I will be telling him\" \n\nThat's it though. Jesus he went through CHRISTMAS SEASON (if yall celebrate) not knowing wtf happened?!?! No, OP, not the asshole. You did what you felt needed to be done in a shit situation with a key player flat out not participating. What did he expect you to do???", "NTA. Your son needed to understand and know and grieve himself. Your ex obviously wasn\u2019t in a place to make a good decision. But he should have included him from the start.", "Oh, NTA. You did the best you could.  Waiting months to tell a little boy the news ... I understand it could be rough for your ex, I'm sure he wanted to be the person to tell the news... but he was asking you to lie to your son every day for weeks.  \n\nAnd as people have said, he may have wanted time to not be a parent, but he should have measured that in hours or a day, not weeks and months. I'm so sorry for your loss of a new friend, and your son's loss of a little brother.", "NTA, no matter how much you\u2019re grieving, you lose some rights as a parent when you ghost your own child for months. you took WHAT from him? the opportunity to see the sad look on his child\u2019s face when he broke this awful news? sorry but who cares what he or his family thinks.", "What\u2019s wrong with these people, this is strange behavior, he wants to tell his son on his birthday that his son\u2019s brother and stepmom passed away, its not like this was good news or something, it sounds weird but he is going through it. NTA.", "NTA.   I mean, it had been almost 3 months, and though dad was grieving, I kinda can\u2019t believe he ghosted his son.   I do realize ppl grieve differently, but the child was asking for his dad.  I really don\u2019t see where you had any other choice.   Dad will calm down with time.", "NTA xoxo", "NTA: Your ex doesn't get to stop being a father because of grief, he has to learn that he has responsibilities and he shoved all of them away for the sake of his own ego and heartbreak.", "NTA. However heartbreaking the situation is it is never a reason to ghost your son. Kids get very anxious and as many others mentions you have be extremly kind to be this patient for almost three months. It was definitely the right thing to do and it is also so saddening to think of a little child asking questions and not getting the right answers. As for the rest of the family they are senseless too, what validation are the seeking ? A week or so is reasonable not months keeping a poor child in dark. Also the part about the kid drawing for his dad melts my heart, hope all of you heal soon!", "NTA\n\nYes he's grieving but as a father he has been grossly irresponsible, insensitive and uncaring to his son and to put this restriction on you.", "You are NTA. Take it from someone who's sister died when I was 4 (and at the time children weren't really included in funerals) - and I have trauma from that time. You did the right thing. Your ex and his family are really big A-Hs.", "NTA, he waited three months? No matter how much grief there is, you can't put a kid on pause.\n\nHe didn't call for months.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry for the losses that you all are dealing with and as his mom, it was completely reasonable for you to explain to your son why he hadn\u2019t seen his dad in months. Your ex had plenty of opportunities to break the news, but he didn\u2019t. I can only imagine the unbearable amount of pain that he\u2019s been in, losing his love and their baby, but the world has continued to turn. Your son had questions. You answered them. Your ex and his family can go pound sand on this one.", "NTA", "NTA. Honestly I find it heartbreaking for your son how lost and confused he was probably feeling like they didn\u2019t want him anymore now that they had a new baby. You 100% did the right thing", "By the title alone I was ready to think you were TA, but after reading this, you are 100% NTA! \nI think you handled this sweetly, and if your ex would just take a step back he'd probably see the same. The fact that his family is jumping on his bandwagon makes me think he wasn't raised to think about anyone's perspective but his own..\nI mean your son has been drawing pictures to cheer him up! It doesn't get sweeter than that!", "NTA - you treated both your child and your ex with dignity, respect, compassion. \nYou backed that man to your child when he\u2019d fallen off the face of the earth for 4 months.", "Your son thought he was being replaced by the baby and abandoned. Maybe he didn\u2019t have the words or courage to say that, but he sure could feel it. Even a four year old could form that conclusion after 3+ months. This way is better, your Ex will get drawings for his birthday instead of all the pressure and sadness of telling him.", "NTA in any way whatsoever. You have to parent your child, and children should not be lied to/ sheltered from the truth. I really don\u2019t even understand why he wasn\u2019t allowed to go to the funeral so he could process the loss just like everyone else, but I guess that\u2019s personal preference.", "Omg NTA this is literally my story. My kids stepmother passed in 2018. My boys were 5. As soon as dad called me and said she's gone I immediately burst into tears, grabbed my boys and told them. We cried together.  How dare him try to make her death about him! It's not something to plan....oh I can't wait to tell him! That's sick plus the child has a right to know and grieve like everyone else.", "Parenting doesn't stop for anything, even tragedy.\n\nNTA\n\nYour ex is allowed to grieve, he's not allowed to abandon his child.", "NTA\n\nI can see them expecting you to wait a week or two but three months? No. You get to choose not to lie to your kid. \n\nYour ex is an adult with a child that he still needed to be responsible for. Did the ex skip work for those three months too? Did he stop paying his bills? He and his family didn't want to deal with the older child and now they're peeved someone else did. Screw them.", "Hopping onto the top comment to say OP, you are definitely NTA.\n\nIn December 2021 I gave birth to a son who died the next day from a congenital defect. That same day my husband and I came home from the hospital and told our 5 and 8 year old sons that their baby brother had died. Sitting there telling them what had happened to their baby brother while my husband hugged them and cried is one of the hardest things I've ever done. But *that was our job as their parents*. I answered their painful questions, I showed them my grief, we comforted them through their anxieties and we got through it together, as a family.\n\nI sympathize with your ex. Losing a child is so deeply painful, and he lost his partner on top of it. But your son deserved to know the truth so he could process his own feelings. If it had been a couple of days, that's one thing, but it's been months.", "Seriously My three year old would pick up on that. They're not stupid. Kids are just learning how to be human. It doesn't mean they don't notice things are different. I wouldn't have waited near as long. OP really tried to respect her co-parent but he literally disappeared for a Quarter of a YEAR! That's eons for a six year old. NTA", "I was told my uncle who committed suicide went for a bike ride and never came home. They didn't hide that he was dead just the cause of it. I dont think a small child needs specifics but I think they do need to know what happened and that these people won't be around any more", "Not to mention dad just opted out on parenting. You don\u2019t get to do that just cause you\u2019re grieving. He should have made some effort to see his son, even if he didn\u2019t take him overnight.", "I thought it was going to be an issue of minutes or hours, not months.", "Yeah it's fine for dad to want to tell him but he needs to actually do it!", "Agreed. He should lose a lot of custody over this.", "I say this because I myself am devastated and have had to grieve in front of my kids this whole past month since she died. I wish I didn't have to tell my kids and someone else could have. Explained what I was going through instead of my kids just seeing it that first day", "She waited months. But you call her an A H cos you will have waited a week? Lol", "I'd have told a week before Christmas. The kid didn't deserve to be told his dad and dad's new family were 'too busy' to do any holiday stuff with him. A few weeks is the longest this should have been kept from the son. If the dad couldn't bring himself to talk to his own kid, then he should have ok'd OP to tell him.", "There was one (not too long ago) where the father didn't tell the kids that their mother died of cancer *for three years* and OP actually went along with it for that long!", "[deleted]", "This is a bot.

Limiting contacts while grieving can be beneficial to both the parent and the child, but going no contact and not explaining it at all to the child is cruel and will have long lasting impact on the child.", "He may not understand it exactly like an adult, but yes, a 6 year old feels the impact.\n\nMy sister died when I was five and the magnitude of the situation hit me full on.  I wasn't allowed to go to the funeral.  I felt very isolated and dismissed.", "He's old enough to know his dad ghosted him for nearly 4 months. Without having a reason, he'll come up with his own. \n\nHe knows dad was going to have a new baby soon. Now he doesn't see dad anymore. Dad must want to be with the new baby instead of him. 6yos do pick up and understand a lot.", "Thank you for the correction!   It was a typo!\n\nI strongly think it would have been better for her kid to tell him soon, but she isn\u2019t TA, in any of these situations.   The father is, because he just blew off his living kid, while making rules for him.  Can\u2019t have both of those.", "Exactly! Besides, in a situation with grief that intense it could be a blessing that the other parent talked about it first.\n\nNothing prevents dad from talking about it too.", "I agree. Then, when he finally decided to be a parent again, he gets mad that OP 'took that moment away from *him*'. OP's job is to take care of her son, not cater to an absent parent's wishes. Her son deserved to know why he got ghosted.", "Yeah, but the poster you replied to is still right.\n\nThe details don\u2019t matter. Ghosting your six year old son is shitty. Even when there\u2019s understandable reasons.", "You don't to opt out of being a parent, period. Yes it's hard on the dad but a 6 year old is cognizant enough to know when things are off. 3 months without reaching out to your kid is abandonment.\n\nIf the baby would have survived would he also get to abandon them as well? Life happens and sometimes it sucks. When you choose to be a parent you also choose to put the kids needs above your own. He didn't even text back to tell her a plan, or call to check in on his living child.   \n\n\nOP is also a parent and knows what their child can handle. She handled it the best she could.", "Is that why the text looks different and...partly highlighted?", "Five or six is certainly old enough to go to a funeral.

It will last about an hour and we are going home afterwards (or to grandma's or a friend  --  whatever).\n\nNot including these kids at 5 or 6 gives them the message that their grief isn't as important and/or the kid isn't really part of the REAL family.", "This isn't on OP. Dad dropped the ball and left OP to take up the slack. He was an absent parent through the entire holiday season. Her child had questions. She was actually present and communicating with her kid.

You WANTED to tell your son about your wife and baby\u2019s death? BS. He just wants to be mad.", "Op is a better person than me. I understand grief. I could understand needing a couple of days. But ghosting your own child for 3+ months in the name of grief is beyond selfish of him.", "I can see like opting out for a day or two. When my Grandpa passed earlier this month, my husband did all the parenting for a day so I could just.... Exist and not human.

Everyone needs to be able to talk about their grieving. No one should feel as if they have to go through it alone.
