I 37F was lying on my couch while my husband was in the yard doing some work, when all of a sudden I heard a really loud bang on my front door. It scared the shit out of me. My heart started racing, not knowing wtf just happened. I got up to go check thinking maybe it was something with my husband, but as I opened the door and looked down the block, I saw 3 kids running away. They were kinda far, but yelled out \"I dare you to do it again, you little assholes\". I checked the ring camera playback, but it only caught them running away. On my door was 3 wet footprints since it rained earlier. Like, all 3 of them kicked the door at the same time. I was super pissed at this point. I grabbed my car keys, jumped in my car, and went after them. \n\nThey weren't that far, around the corner at this time. I pulled my car up to the sidewalk, window down, and just completely went off on them. This included yelling and lots of cursing. They were shook, and tried to say they were just playing \"ding dong ditch\". The last thing I remember saying was if I catch you in front of my house again, it's going to be a bigger problem. When I got back home again, and calmed down a bit, I started thinking about it. The kids were actually pretty young. Like, couldn't be more than 12 or 13, and they admittedly looked scared as shit lol, and thought maybe I could've handled it better. But, at the same time, I feel like if I just let them off, they would keep doing stupid things like that, and think it's ok. Also, I honestly wouldn't have reacted so strongly if it was merely them ringing the door bell, and running, but them kicking it like that really really scared me. I thought someone was breaking in.

Threats of violence?", "Not wrong for being mad, but it\u2019s dangerous legally to act like that.\nA lot of police would treat you as a crazy person if they told their parents about it, and if they chose to call them.", "NTA. They gotta learn respect for other people\u2019s property and you made sure they will be now lol. All you did was scare them straight, their parents should have done it sooner anyway.", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nThey deserved it - kicking your door is obnoxious.", "NTA. I know some kids that are the exact age you describe, and they are vile. They'll grow out of it, I think, but they need help along the way. I believe you are helping them! Good job!", "\nNo, but I have a thought. I would go back and find out who they were and do something nice for them. I know that sounds crazy but you can actually turn them where they won\u2019t want to mess with your house. You can even turn them into kids that will watch your house for you. We did this with some kids on our street. When they were turned down mailboxes we made friends with them And it worked even though you yelled at them you could go back and find them and say hey, I overreacted and I know you guys are just being kids, so I wanted to see if I could do a little something fun for ya. It\u2019s totally not what they will expect.", "ESH that was a bit too much with the cursing and chasing them in the car. I understand your frustration but you have to do it in a way that doesn\u2019t end with you being the primary aggressor. For example, I did walk out to talk to kids who played ding dong ditch but lived right across the street so I recognized them the next time I went out from the recording. I didn\u2019t raise my voice, I didn\u2019t use salty language. I just firmly stated that I have them on camera doing this and that it is going to stop. On another occasion, I found my next door neighbor outside when her son hit my door with a tennis racket and while we don\u2019t speak a shared language, she watched the video and 100% was pissed at her kid. No one comes at my door except on Halloween anymore :)", "You probably saved their lives. Someone else with your pissed off mindset could have had a gun. \n\nNTA. Kids are stupid but at those ages they have the internet and know bad things happen.\n\nI\u2019m only in my 40s and grew up going door to door to sell Boy Scout shit or ask to shovel a driveway. No way in hell I\u2019d do that now for money, much less to antagonize people", "NTA. In fact, you are quite kinda and thoughtful to show such tough love. You probably lowered the chances of any of them ever ending up in jail. Don\u2019t poke the bear is a vital lesson.", "At first I thought they were really tiny, but 12 or 13 year olds? Absolutely deserved it, if not more. NTA.", "no, kick door bad teach lesson life good", "NTA. Hopefully you scared them straight", "NTA. We are having problems with kids around that age in our shopping center. They move from one store to the next terrorizing staff. One store banned all kids under 16 without an adult after 5pm. Wish we could. At this point we are calling the cops next time they try to come in. I\u2019m not usually about calling the cops, but I\u2019m over these dumb white kid shenanigans (I\u2019m white). They freaking sprayed my entire store with fart spray after begging to just use the restrooms. Half my staff wants to just straight up murder them.", "Probably nta -- I think it would depend on if they looked scared as in \"oh no we're in big trouble\" or scared as in, \"this person might hurt us.\"  I think 11 - 13 is honestly a good age to be reminded that other people have feelings and silly pranks can have consequences of people being upset or angry. They probably thought it was a joke when they did it: Now they are aware of a more serious perspective.  It's maybe not the absolute best way to handle the scenario, but I don't think you need to worry you did any harm.\n\nI will say that that age is also open to the nuance of a, \"You were wrong but I could have handled myself better\" type apology. So if you are feeling guilty or worried they will somehow escalate and turn you into their nemesis, I'd keep an eye out for them just to say, \"Hey, I just wanted to talk more about our interaction. Your prank made me feel scared/upset/etc. and that affected how I spoke to you. I hope you understand why that's a harmful prank to do, but I also wanted to make sure I explained myself in a way that's less inflammatory.\"  That could also be a learning experience for the kids so they don't stereotype you as the lady who yells at them but helps them see you as a complete person. Also it might head off any Halloween retaliation ;)", "YTA for driving after them. This is the kind of behavior kids are told is predatory and you likely scared them beyond reason. Actually chasing them down in your car was way over the line. Yell at them from your door or your yard, whatever. Literally hinting them down in your car is honestly disturbing to me, and if I were their parent I\u2019d be horrified- by their behavior, but even more so by your rage and willingness to seek them out to verbally attack them. \n\nSeriously- if you were a parent and your kid said someone drove after them to scream and swear at them for one act of mischief, you\u2019d be terrified for your child\u2019s safety no matter the reason.", "good run them over next time, kids are demons now days they aint shit nta tbh", "NTA.

I pulled over and let rip. What if I'd swerved toward them?    Sometimes kids need a good bollocking and letting them know not everyone will put up with their shit.", "Yeah YTA.
