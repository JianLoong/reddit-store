A diamond ring is significantly smaller than a pair of pyjamas. Your wife\u2019s logic of size = value (naughty/nice) is bizarre, and the way she posed it to the children will now put that idea in their heads.", "So in her logic, all kids from poor parents should consider themselves naughtier because they got less expensive gifts? NTA.", "Children don't think like adults", "NTA because you're simply expressing an opinion, just as the kids are expressing theirs.\n\nRemember, they can't think like adults.  A Nintendo switch comes in a smaller package than a doll house, which is less expense.  The kids have no idea of that and can't possibly fathom it.  Of course they think a bigger box means more!", "I usually spend the same monetary value. Smaller items can often be more expensive than a larger one", "NTA.\nThis sounds like Harry Potter where the kid was counting his gifts and having a fit over having one less than expected.", "NTA. Ask  your children if they been naughtier if they get big bag of  coal  or if they get a small thing they wanted..\n\nAlso take the kids out and buy something big  to the wife from the kids, like huge  toy , wheel barrow or something else weird, it just need to be large.", "Oh wow, I thought this was going to be an argument because of the kids, but it's with an adult. NTA.  \n  \nI'm also confused. I don't get how it's not the same size since you'd either be giving money or a second gift to make up for it. Or do they mean the actual size and not monetary value?", "Also, children are not good judges of what things cost. Don\u2019t get drawn into the Naughty/Nice Size V Expense Santa Gift Index.

They think that either they were less good OR that they are less loved. \n\nOk, by adult logic that isn\u2019t accurate or reasonable but you cannot expect a four year old to have adult logic- they believe a man flies all round the world in one night for goodness sake. I once got two gifts which cost the same for two of my nieces but one I bought on sale so was worth more than the other, the look on the child\u2019s face with the cheaper gift made me feel so guilty- despite them being super polite and thanking me for a lovely gift with a smile, their little eyes kept glancing at the other toy and the smile would drop when they thought I wasn\u2019t looking. It\u2019s not about gratitude or being spoilt or expecting big gifts, it\u2019s about children being able to notice from a very young age when they\u2019re being treated differently than other children and how that makes them feel.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe she can burn it like the children's souls she burnt and warm up any remnants of her charcoal black heart.\n\nPlus, any people saying size matters for children, it's the value of the gift, not the size, and you need to consider that numerous things kids want are becoming tech-based and, to that point, smaller.\n\nIf you can, chat with the parents about adding something to the gift or save that spare amount into a side account until you have enough to invest in an ETF on their behalf to gift them once they turn 18.", "NTA. My parents always spent the same amount of money on each of us, which meant sometimes someone with a more expensive gift only got one thing and someone else with less expensive gifts would get \u201cmore\u201d.   The physical size of a gift doesn\u2019t determine its value to the recipient.  \n\nThe only gift my 3 year old has requested this year is a bicycle bell, which is quite small.  If she didn\u2019t receive the thing she really wants \u201cbecause it\u2019s not big\u201d, she\u2019d be super disappointed.", "NTA, your wife is projecting.  OTOH your godchild is only 4 so maybe have something bigger in reserve in case they do feel a bit left out when the presents are opened.", "NTA - if the kid wanted a smaller present, get the smaller one and put the rest in a savings account. most kids don\u2019t understand pricing so if they get what they ask for they will be just as happy.", "If the kid asked for it, they will be happy to get what they wanted rather than a gift they didn\u2019t want. However, I\u2019d just get them another gift with the rest of the money if they\u2019re too young to appreciate actual money. \n\nHowever, your wife\u2019s logic is also flawed because some big presents can be a lot cheaper than smaller presents. And kids don\u2019t compare size but they do compare how \u201cgood\u201d the gift is.", "Your wife was TA for planting the notion in the children\u2019s minds.", "NTA, you will go crazy with this theory. Spend the same amount of money on them and don't worry about the rest. I cannot imagine how hard that would be to make sure each present is the same size and same amount of money was spent.", "This is ridiculous.  I have two four year olds and they definitely don't care about the size.  They care that everyone has the same number.....if one kid has two and they have one, they would care more.", "Yeah that\u2019s what I got from it too, and why is she trying to start a competition when there is none there?", "I always used to make sure kids presents were similar value & size when they are young, because it matters to young brains."]}
