I want to teach my children that if they get a present they should be happy either way, regardless of what someone else gets.

To make my post a bit more clear, i am not talking about the actual size/dimension of the present but the value. The gift he is asking for is a non-brand toy from a cheap store while the other children asked for brand toys so they are more expensive. A kid might think that he wasn't nice because he only gets a 15$ present while other kids get a 50$ present (not knowing that i gave some extra money to his parent for his savingsaccount so that he got just as much as all the other children). \n\nEdit 2 : After reading all the comments i have decided to buy an extra gift.

However, I\u2019d just get them another gift with the rest of the money if they\u2019re too young to appreciate actual money. \n\nHowever, your wife\u2019s logic is also flawed because some big presents can be a lot cheaper than smaller presents. And kids don\u2019t compare size but they do compare how \u201cgood\u201d the gift is.", "Your wife was TA for planting the notion in the children\u2019s minds.", "NTA, you will go crazy with this theory. Spend the same amount of money on them and don't worry about the rest. I cannot imagine how hard that would be to make sure each present is the same size and same amount of money was spent.", "This is ridiculous.  I have two four year olds and they definitely don't care about the size.  They care that everyone has the same number.....if one kid has two and they have one, they would care more.", "Yeah that\u2019s what I got from it too, and why is she trying to start a competition when there is none there?", "I always used to make sure kids presents were similar value & size when they are young, because it matters to young brains.", "I think when gifting to siblings etc, the value should be similar.  Because kids will notice if one gets a giant Lego set  and one gets a stuffed animal.", "Here's the thing... the reason the comments are so split here, is that how adult people feel about gifts almost entirely hinges upon how you were raised to feel about them. \n\nFor example, it was drilled into my head by my mom the second I got old enough to pick out gifts for other people that how much I spent person to person mattered greatly. If I spent more on one person than another, I was 'being cruel' to the person I spent less on. I can remember mom making sure that if one kid asked for something expensive, the other kid got more less expensive toys to equal out the amounts. Size of gifts never factored in, but she did put the multiple smaller gifts in one box so we opened the same number of things. Meanwhile I remember Christmas with dad and watching his favorite, my brother, get CD players and BB guns and tons of pricey items while he just gave my aunts some cash to pick me out a doll. Did I understand exact dollar amounts as a kid? No, but I still understood that I, the girl he never wanted, had been given a throwaway gift while his golden child was being doted on. That's why even though as an adult, I can recognize there are toxic aspects to looking at the price of gifts so harshly, I still have a hard time not spending similar amounts on other people, especially kids, because I'm so scared ill hurt someone's feelings. My husband grew up very differently, and had no such price specifications on gift giving, so he doesn't understand my need to 'balance' the gifts in such a way when we buy for neices and nephews.\n\nWith that in mind, I'd say NAH. You and your wife think of gift giving differently because you were taught to, and just need to learn how to compromise your different ways. You seem to think  similar to me with price matching, while size seems to matter to her. She's not trying to be mean to the kid, I think she genuinely is worried about hurting them. Maybe in her eagerness to 'help' the kids she asked leading questions in her poll... maybe they already felt similarly to her for other reasons from their childhood so far. I can only guess on that. But either way, the size thing -is- on the kids mind now, and they will be thinking of it with kid logic while opening gifts. So you might want to consider that. \n\nIs it possible, since you were gonna give the 'extra' money you wanted to give the kid to their parents, for you to use it to get a cheap but larger sized gift to 'match' closer to what the other kid is getting? Then combine the gifts in one box so each kid opens a similarly sized present. That could be a good compromise for you and your wife this year, and then you have 12 more months to talk things out and find a better way to handle things for next year.", "When I was 8 years old, my best friend and I argued over who got the better haul from Santa. To settle it, we got out the Sears catalog and started tallying up the cost of our gifts. My mom was really angry when she discovered what we were doing.", "Kids absolutely do compare (but one can explicitly tell them they got special money in another account and kids like that too).\n\nAlso, if the kid asked for a specific but cheap thing, at 4 that doesn\u2019t mean that they will look at the gift and say huh my brother got a $50 gift and mine is only $10. \n\nKids are terrible at guessing cost of presents, esp that age. In fact they are just as likely to think that an Apple Watch is a smaller gift than some bulky toy from Walmart.\n\nSo of the $10 gift is something the kid really wants, it might be seen as a \u201cbig\u201d gift.\n\nI think your wife is projecting. Also you should find out what the parents would prefer. My kids don\u2019t exactly need more material belongings\u2026 NTA", "NAH.  Your heart is in the right place, but your head is in an overly idealistic place. You are going based on the way people should act, while your wife is going based on how they do act.

Your donation to a savings account or a college plan is like the grandma who gave savings bonds as a gift", "NTA \n\nAs a child, I remember being disappointed that I didn't get the cheap plastic gift I asked for. That I got a way more valuable gift I didn't even realise.\n\nKids see value different than adults. 4 year olds see value different than 8 year olds. 4 year olds will get a \u20ac2 coin to buy candy, spend \u20ac0,50 on candy, get 3 \u20ac0,50 coins in change and be happy because they now have candy AND more money (coins)!", "NTA, that is a dumb way to compare gifts. My parents always spent the same amount on our Christmas gifts. We always got the usual sweaters and such, but my brother loved Legos, so he would get a nice Lego set and I got jewelry. Mine was much smaller obviously, but I knew the gifts cost about the same. Never felt like my brother was nicer to get a bigger gift and I\u2019m sure he felt the same with my necklaces.", "You can have your opinion however you want.  The parents will likely be happy to add to a savings account for the children, but do you really think a small child will think in those terms?

You can teach them to appreciate any gift and eventually they will get it, but it does take time.", "Soft YTA. Because you don\u2019t understand most kids.

And sure, children should be taught not to compare. \n\nBut kids also don\u2019t know what they want til they see it.

How do you even begin to compare the two?\n\nIf a $10 gift that was perfect for someone makes the recipient happy  as a clam, then I would hope the goal was made. \n\nNo one wants to be related to, or friends with, people who compare every cent put into a gift.

That's the point of parents - protect their children and slowly teach them age appropriate lessons about growing up.\n\nKids should also wash their hands thoroughly, clean their rooms carefully, and start investing early for retirement with their an afterschool job.

Any time anyone would ask, he would just said \"cardboard boxes.\" \n\nI cannot tell you how happy he was when he woke up Christmas morning and saw a huge stack of cardboard under the tree wrapped in a pretty red ribbon. He got other presents to open too, but he literally didn't give a single f\\*ck about any of them, he just loved the cardboard so much.

These ideals grow with the children in age, considering you're being reasonable with gifts and not being one kid a shirt and the other a MacBook.\n\nAlso, I really wish people would leave the big gifts to the parents and not outshine them with over-the-top gifts.

Kids can and do notice value over size, and care way more about getting what they asked for, rather than random junk to match the size/monetary value of another kid.\n\nAnd if a kid really does constantly think bigger is better, I'd say it's better to disappoint and teach them that isn't true now, rather than when they're a monstrous 15 year old", "This was the plan. He wants something from the dollarstore so it's a cheap but he really wants it (parents say he is been talking about it for days). So he is getting what he wants and because he also gets the extra cash (not now but later) he get's the same value gift (but he doesn't know this so he might feel leftout if he realises his present wasn't as expensive).", "Not really a Santa-kind of thing to do, put money in a card and attach it to a gift. Just my opinion.", "This is a good idea, I will keep this in mind.", "Why don\u2019t you just give home the gift he wants and $35. That way he can go pick something out himself. While it\u2019s nice to add to his savings account, that really doesn\u2019t mean anything to a 4 year old.", "I mean, that\u2019s the whole Santa narrative. That\u2019s why a lot of folks aren\u2019t teaching it to their kids anymore.", "Op just a thought. This is nah situation. But for me giving the money difference to the parents to put in the e.g. college fund is a bad idea, especially with kids so young. Like imagine in 15 years kids will know much much is there and suddenly their brother has like 300$ more. And when asking why they will hear \u201cwell, as a 4yo kid he asked for a cheaper Christmas gift, so op gave the rest to the fund\u201d. I do t know how you, but I would feel betrayed that a decision I made while an innocent and not aware kid suddenly makes a difference when I\u2019m adult. And I know it\u2019s only 300$, but still. It might be a good idea while a teenager when they can understand it. Like asking for something cheaper \u201cyou want anything more or should I put the difference for the college fund\u201d? Then they can decide. \nAnd just another way of thinking, but it\u2019s not only about the upbringing. While you don\u2019t care about the money value I\u2019m sure both your wife and rest of the family likes you enough to buy something tailored for you. It\u2019s not the price it\u2019s the thought. But if every time you buy something expensive while receiving something much cheaper it is bad behaviour. As long as it\u2019s not a pattern one time difference is not a big deal.  It your wife\u2019s way is also not bad.", "I disagree; the problem isn\u2019t \u201cusing adult logic on young kids,\u201d it\u2019s the inherent problem with the cultural narrative about Santa that you and others have identified.

Are they opening it next to another child who gets something larger and flashier?
