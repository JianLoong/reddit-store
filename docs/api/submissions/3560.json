Our house is small and his siblings children are loud and messy. My eldest daughter also agrees and wants a nice quiet Christmas with us and her sister. My husband said that was fine with him at the time. \n\nI've recently learned (via my daughter) in the group-chat that John and she is in for the World Cup, he has agreed to host a small lunch for everyone on Christmas. \n\nI will admit I was very annoyed and didn't hide it. He called me selfish and said that it was a nice thing to do for everyone and that he wants to do this. I called him out on the fact that he makes our eldest prep and cook everything (she wakes up at 7am just to do this) and it's not fair to go back on his word. That if he wanted to see any of his siblings that badly, he would arrange a day and drive to see them. He never sees my in-laws or relatives at Christmas. (we have a similar amount of siblings).
