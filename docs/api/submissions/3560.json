I wouldn't have a car because I had to fly or take a train there so I was completely at their mercy.", "YTA\n\n\\>I've recently learned (via my daughter) in the group-chat that John and she is in for the World Cup, he has agreed to host a small lunch for everyone on Christmas.\n\nThat's fine. You just reply, *\"OK, we'll all go out for a walk and keep out of your way while you're cooking. When shall we come back - 2pm?*", "NTA - if he wants to play this game... you and the kids will leave the night before and then magically appear at lunchtime with the rest of the guests. He will be prepping and cooking by himself since it is HE that volunteered even knowing the rest of you did not want this.\n\nHis monkeys, his circus. He knew how you all felt then he went behind your backs and did it anyways.", "NTA \n\nTell him that *he* is doing all the cooking and don't let him wrangle your oldest into doing the work. Partner went behind your back to do this so he can manage alone.", "NTA.  I agree with a lot of other commenters that you need to make sure he owns up to this completely by doing it all himself.  Encourage your eldest to find something else to do, heck, take her and the other child out to enjoy a quiet lunch of your own.  If he says he wants to host, then leave it to him to do so.", "NTA\nBUT DO NOT PREPARE ANYTHING. See what happens.... if he wants everyone over, he can do it all. Prepare 22year old for the fallout and plan your xmas dinner for a day or so afterwards instead. It's unfair to lump everything on you when you jave said you won't do it.", "ESH, a lot going on here.  Forcing your daughter to make Christmas dinner for a large family (call it lunch all you like, the time of day you eat it doesn't change the context of the meal) is nuts to begin with, that's a multi person task that both of you should be doing with her support not letting her do it herself.  You're TA for just as much as your husband for this part, get up and help her.\n\nYour husband is clearly TA for agreeing to host when you've explicitly said you don't want to after 5 years in a row.", "You have hosted all the siblings for 5 years straight. I'd say it is more than time for someone else to take a turn. Reciprocal hospitality is a thing. NTA", "Tell your daughter that her dad will be doing all the cooking for Christmas lunch.  Take your girls out to lunch just the 3 of you or go to your family. \n\nTell your husband that he will have to do all the cooking for his family since you and the kids have other plans. \n\nNTA", "NTA I recommend you and your eldest make plans with your side of the family. Tell your husband that he is free to keep the 3yo for the day if he chooses, but you and the eldest will be away. Let him host, lol. And make sure HE is actually the one doing the hosting. \n\nBut he won't like it, so be prepared for that.", "NTA.  Tell hubby that he's doing all the work for Christmas lunch this year.  That includes shopping and paying for everything, prepping and cooking and oh, don't forget the cleanup.\n\nDecisions like this should be made together as a couple.  If he's so hell bent on hosting the lunch and didn't talk to you before he made the offer, then it's his responsibility to take care of the lunch.", "NTA\n\nIf he wants to host, having committed contrary to your plans, he does the work and agrees to clean up after.\n\nEnjoy your Christmas, and if you and eldest are overwhelmed and peopled out, retreat to a bedroom for a nap/reading/mother daughter nails/craft date. \"Lovely to see you guys! I'm stuffed and wiped, I'm going to go lie down, see you next time!\"", "Is the adult child his? How long have you two been together?", "NTA\n\n\nShoneys is usually open on Christmas. You can have your nice quiet Christmas there with the old folks and he can have his miserable lunch at home.", "Btw. Time to book a spa day!", "NTA\n\nId tell your oldest that if she doesn't want to cook then she doesn't have to. Make him do all the cooking and planning if its truly what he wants. If he wants it enough it shouldn't be a problem.", "NTA. He needs to do all the prep work, cooking, and cleaning. He won\u2019t volunteer again.", "NTA. Great solution, you and the kids don\u2019t do anything to help him. HE agreed to host the lunch and he will. He will do the cooking and all the cleanup associated with it. \n\nThis was not the plan your family agreed on. He changed it so he can deal with the consequences. \n\nI would also consider taking the kids out the house (maybe y\u2019all can do a rage room) if they want to do something that isn\u2019t the lunch.", "She should take the kids somewhere and show up at party time. Let him host.", "Yes. He agreed to host so let him. The planning, shopping, cooking, cleaning.  All him. NTA.", "After all he said \"he wants to do this\" so let HIM do it.", "Because it is Reddit AITA, and apparently nobody ever knows how to use their words.\n\nHow these two supposedly grown ass adult parents can\u2019t sit down and figure out how to host a lunch without someone being put out and overworked is beyond me.", "I would however i'm not a part of that chat, or any with his siblings", "(snuggle and stream a Christmas movie!)", "She is yes, we've been together for 23 years now", "Why does she always have to wake up at 7am to do all the prep and cooking? I get that this year you aren't wanting to be involved but you said she always does. Why are you and your husband not helping her?", "I agree.  This, \ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffbOP.  He invited them against all of your wishes, they are his guests, so remove yourselves from the situation and let him host while you and your daughters go somewhere to enjoy your day."]}
