She refused to listen and become hostile (not aggressive, but rude)\n\nYou had every right to do what u did, and I agree with u \n\nAs a rule of thumb, I like to leave 1 behind tho, JIC of stuff like this.\n\nHowever, I'm also an instacart shopper, so sometimes I can't do this, and I feel bad. \n\nThere's no \"leave one\" rule, but for some reason ... even growing up in a big family with stores far away... it's engraved in me....the parents, I'm sure", "NTA.

It seems to me that in this situation, you looked out for yourself first, and your neighbor second, and not at the price of your self-respect.\n\nOh, and it looks like from your story that the cashier rang you up and you were good to go, no \"limit x per customer policy\". Oh well. The other shopper can spend ten minutes convincing someone to restock the product.", "NTA. Nope, first come, first serve.
