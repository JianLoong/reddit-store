But it never ceases to amaze me that people think that is the best way to get what they want.\n\nI have a friend who worked in sales who is outrageously successful in getting extra perks because she isn't afraid to ask but is always so pleasant and appreciative that people really wanted to do her a favor. \n\nWe were traveling together on a vacation and she had status on the airline while I did not. I was booked in regular coach but she had been upgraded to Economy plus. I could have paid I think $69 for a seat upgrade, but hadn't bothered to do so. She chatted up the gate agent, mentioned that we were traveling together and politely asked was there any way we could sit together. I got the better seat for free since it hadn't been sold - although technically someone checking in at the gate could have still purchased the upgrade.", "Not a roll, but I\u2019m not gonna lie - I love the ballerina cookies.

Only downside was that he made me help the customer carry some of the massive orders out to the truck for them lol", "Yep, I worked grocery and most stores will happily place special orders for you. We had plenty of people with recurring orders monthly or whatever.", "I think I agree with that. I personally think Scoldy Lady was out of line, but then there's not much I think would inspire me to public scolding. I didn't even participate in The Great Toilet Paper Battles of 2021 lol. I tend to just say \"oh well\" if the store's out of the thing I want, ask the stockpeople if there will be more soon and then wait or figure out what I'm going to use instead. I mean, there's always going to be someone who takes the last of something. Scoldy Lady should've known chewing someone out is crappy and certainly doesn't usually end in their then giving you the thing you want. But if she hadn't said anything at all, or had taken the offered cinnamon rolls, would OP still be or not be an AH? Like, what if there were two more people standing by quietly also wanting cinnamon rolls. Would they be justified in thinking OP was an AH? If 5 other people came up asking for cinnamon rolls, would *they* be AHs (because who asks for things out of someone else's cart). idk, I can't bring myself to call someone who takes cinnamon rolls an AH. I mean, they're delicious (and ngl I have to seriously hold myself back when I see a Cinnabon), but no one's going to die either way. No one's long term happiness is at stake here, so I feel like objectively speaking there's mild buttfaceness on OP's side, stronger levels of buttface on Scoldy Lady's side and a business opportunity afoot for anyone who can crack into the cinnamon bun industry.", "I knew a lady in Oslo who took her clothes to London to be dry cleaned.", "My mom makes apparently delicious cinnamon rolls at home.
