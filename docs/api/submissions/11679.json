Just not asshole grade. \n\nReading your post I was reminded of a time I was at a toy store and saw an ebay flipper find a new Toys R Us exclusive Transformers toy and yank it away from a child who was also reaching for it. The dad said that's his favorite character and his birthday is next month and the flipper...flipped them off and bought it.  That's basically you. He had the right to buy the toy as he technically put his hand on the box first, but he was a gross person and I sincerely hope karma kicked his nuts into his bodily cavity. \n\nSometimes the best joy in the world is sharing.", "Key words mine,I\u2019ll", "Nah I\u2019m not sharing at all", "Hahahaha I was also looking forward to the answer, these are terrible and are sold in the cheap section of any supermarket here \ud83d\ude02\nIn Sweden they also have them with Safran taste, FYI!", "Kanelgifflar they are the best, almost better than cinnamon buns.

That way you don't clean out the shelves and she doesn't have to worry about multiple trips. \n\nI am a vendor and services products like that, and someone clearing me out really fucks up my ordering.

Personally, if someone had taken them all, I would take the L and go back whenever I can. I don't believe anyone owes me anything. If it was an essential, fair enough but they were cinnamon buns.
