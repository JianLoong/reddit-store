I initially said no and they then asked if I would at least eat dinner in my room so they didn't have to see it.\n\nI feel torn. On one hand, there is no massive harm to me waiting another 30/45 mins to have my dinner, so I could do a small thing to help them.

But, part of living together, or having friendships, is doing things for other people and accommodating them in your life. \n\nWhen I had a roommate, I would make myself scarce when they had a date coming over, or do their dishes when they left in a rush, did lots of airport runs, or helped them clean up when they had food poisoning. Your \"why should I change my behavior, it is their choice\" is just not a great attitude to have when building or maintaining relationships. \n\nI get if you don't want to eat later, and that you still need to cook and all that. But would eating in your room be a major inconvenience? Picking a few meals that don't create a lot of smell? \n\nWe all adjust our lives to fit the needs and wants of others: You think I want to listen to my partner's story about video games, or drive 2 hours to pick him up from the airport? Did I want to spend a day babysitting my niece, or carting my dad to the flea market? Did I want that ugly lamp in my college apartment that my roommate loved?

It sounds like you know it\u2019s not a huge deal for you but it is a huge deal for them.  If you really don\u2019t think it a big ask and there is no harm in doing it then just do it.  If this was a scheduling issue because it\u2019s the only time you can eat or a medical issue that requires you to eat at a specific time then it would 100% be on them to figure it out for themselves and avoid temptation.  I agree that it is their religion and their responsibility to avoid temptation, but it really sounds like it\u2019s not a huge deal but you are choosing to make it harder for them because it\u2019s not your religion and you don\u2019t want to do a small thing that might help make your friends lives just a tiny bit easier during a religious holiday (meaning it also temporary).", "YTA\n\nI don't see why you couldn't *at least eat in your room*.\n\nThey asked a reasonable thing--hey please eat in your room for a few weeks. \n\nI think asking you to not make food at a certain time is unreasonable though.", "It\u2019s posts like this that make me wonder if there\u2019s something wrong with me, because in this situation I\u2019d immediately ask if they want me to eat privately so as not to make things harder for them, especially if it didn\u2019t really inconvenience me.
