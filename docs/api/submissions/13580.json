I initially said no and they then asked if I would at least eat dinner in my room so they didn't have to see it.\n\nI feel torn. On one hand, there is no massive harm to me waiting another 30/45 mins to have my dinner, so I could do a small thing to help them.

But, part of living together, or having friendships, is doing things for other people and accommodating them in your life. \n\nWhen I had a roommate, I would make myself scarce when they had a date coming over, or do their dishes when they left in a rush, did lots of airport runs, or helped them clean up when they had food poisoning. Your \"why should I change my behavior, it is their choice\" is just not a great attitude to have when building or maintaining relationships. \n\nI get if you don't want to eat later, and that you still need to cook and all that. But would eating in your room be a major inconvenience? Picking a few meals that don't create a lot of smell? \n\nWe all adjust our lives to fit the needs and wants of others: You think I want to listen to my partner's story about video games, or drive 2 hours to pick him up from the airport? Did I want to spend a day babysitting my niece, or carting my dad to the flea market? Did I want that ugly lamp in my college apartment that my roommate loved?

It sounds like you know it\u2019s not a huge deal for you but it is a huge deal for them.  If you really don\u2019t think it a big ask and there is no harm in doing it then just do it.  If this was a scheduling issue because it\u2019s the only time you can eat or a medical issue that requires you to eat at a specific time then it would 100% be on them to figure it out for themselves and avoid temptation.  I agree that it is their religion and their responsibility to avoid temptation, but it really sounds like it\u2019s not a huge deal but you are choosing to make it harder for them because it\u2019s not your religion and you don\u2019t want to do a small thing that might help make your friends lives just a tiny bit easier during a religious holiday (meaning it also temporary).", "YTA\n\nI don't see why you couldn't *at least eat in your room*.\n\nThey asked a reasonable thing--hey please eat in your room for a few weeks. \n\nI think asking you to not make food at a certain time is unreasonable though.", "It\u2019s posts like this that make me wonder if there\u2019s something wrong with me, because in this situation I\u2019d immediately ask if they want me to eat privately so as not to make things harder for them, especially if it didn\u2019t really inconvenience me.

I know people have rules like that in mixed faith households and the compromise is that a hindu doesn\u2019t want beef in the house but the other person can go out to eat it.", "\u2018Looking temptations in the face\u2019 is inaccurate. It\u2019s just about experiencing what the less fortunate experience.", "They are being made uncomfortable because of the times when OP is cooking and they believe fasting is the right thing to do. They are willingly to put up with the cooking smell if OP doesn\u2019t eat in the dining room. That\u2019s a compromise.", "Why is it bad to ask for something?", "It\u2019s a shared house.", "How are the flatmates AHs for asking a favour?", "Because, in OPs own words it wouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal\u2026 so if it\u2019s not a huge imposition to OP than not doing it is purely out of spite or some idea that religion is dumb. I\u2019m not a religious person but if something wouldn\u2019t hurt me and would make someone else\u2019s life better, I\u2019d do it. He\u2019s NAH but he\u2019s not being kind either.", "Yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. It\u2019s NAH, but people should tell OP to be a bit nicer because it sucks that the only reason they don\u2019t want to comply with the request was because they can say no.", "Yes, I never said it was? But the flatmates are not ass holes for asking so it\u2019s NAH.", "But that\u2019s two people affected over just one.", "Your scenario is interesting because it is debatable. \n\nIf you share a place with a vegan then it is reasonable to, as a favour, not handle meat in front of them. That doesn\u2019t mean never eat meat, but I think it\u2019s fair to not handle raw meat in front of them. So the example you use is also a reasonable request.", "Why are you comparing Muslims who are practicing fasting for awareness of the poor and charity to screaming kids?", "Get one of those portable desk trays you can put on a bed? I also don\u2019t think people are messy enough to attract ants, at least I was never when I ate in my room for a year.. this sounds like a you problem.", "And in that situation the Hindu would be an asshole for enforcing their beliefs on everyone else, and in this case the Muslims are assholes for doing the same. They are roommates, not family", "Ok but you don\u2019t have homeless people knocking on your door telling you to stop eating your dinner", "\u201cPutting up with the smell\u201d is not compromise as it requires no change in behavior on their part \n\n>being made uncomfortable \n\nSo they should take it on themselves to not be in the house or common area while OP is cooking", "Why is it bad to refuse?", "It is bad to ask something without seeing if you can do it yourself. In this case they seemingly aren\u2019t making any moves to not be in the apartment at that time if it becomes too hard for them", "It's not bad to ask for something. It's bad to ask for something and call the person rude when they refuse.", "Right, which means it's ops as much as it is any of theirs", "Exactly, it's shared.", "for not being able to take no as an answer to that question", "Well, I made that point from a religious perspective. \n\nAround an hour before they break their fasts, they should be at the bloody mosque!", "But that's two people who are actually a part of the religion in question. He is not Muslim, and he isn't obligated to do anything simply because he is one person and two other people are fasting.", "No it's still not rude to eat your normal meal in your goddamn home. \n\nStop shoving your personal beliefs down people's throats.\nWhat they do is a negotiation technique that is also a manipulation technique called \"door in the face\".\n\nBTW it wasn't what I asked you about.", "Get out of here with that nonsense. Vegan here that lived with a non-vegan. They were free to cook what they pleased, and while i wasn't a fan, it was their apartment too.", "The reasonable accommodation for a vegan isn\u2019t I\u2019m going to wait until they leave to handle meat it\u2019s hey - I\u2019m cooking chicken now if you don\u2019t want to see then leave.  They are able to go to their own rooms if they don\u2019t feel comfortable seeing their housemate eat.\nI\u2019ve spent most of the year in keto, it\u2019s not fair for me to say to work colleagues \u2018can you not eat cake in front of me\u2019 If you are choosing to do something it is on you, not on those around you to adapt their lifestyle to fit your diet. Obviously some accommodations should be made for a deadly nut allergy where even the particles can be a problem", "Because it\u2019s not the responsibility of non-Muslims to cater to the religious requirements of Muslims.  You are free to practice your religion as long as it doesn\u2019t inconvenience someone else.  It\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility to make adjustments to their daily life.  If I\u2019m not mistaken, Ramadan lasts for 40 days so for over a month OP has to hole up in her room for her roommates\u2019 convenience.", "Because it doesn\u2019t actually matter what the issue is, it\u2019s not OPs issue! They have a problem they need to figure out how to deal with it not make it someone else\u2019s job", "So I have to buy extra furniture because of someone else\u2019s religion? It\u2019s easier and cleaner for the Muslim roommates to go to their room and for him to eat in the room intended for preparing and eating food.\n\nAlso it\u2019s interesting that my Muslim coworker didn\u2019t demand no one eat in the staff kitchen and he was praying in there. When you share community spaces, you can\u2019t tell people they can\u2019t use it for its intended purpose.", "So now the person needs to buy stuff to accommodate them.", "It's funny. You said in one comment it costs nothing to respect the request, but now you're making suggestions for OP to buy something to make eating in his room possible. \n\nYou're being contrarian in any way you can. Just accept the world doesn't revolve around your choices and move on.", "No one\u2019s an asshole though, it\u2019s a request. I personally would accommodate it.", "Homeless people don\u2019t have a home to see people eating in it", "It\u2019s not bad to refuse, it\u2019s just not good either. No asshole here.", "They didn\u2019t call OP rude, they probably just thought it but everyone has thoughts and feelings. In this post, the flatmates made the ask, got declined and then it got dropped. OP is thinking whether they should reconsider.", "So why are the flatmates ass holes then?", "There is no where in the post to say that they were combative. Just says they asked for a compromise.", "Right, why should two people go uncomfortable over one? That\u2019s unnecessary. One person could make it easier for two people, that\u2019s a gain, not a loss.", "\u2018Negotiation tactic\u2019 what are you on? \n\nIt\u2019s a shared space so compromises are reasonably asked.", "Good for you? But you aren\u2019t the voice of every single vegan on the planet.", "I don\u2019t see anything wrong with either ask. Vegan can excuse themselves but nothing wrong with the vegan making a request in advance.", "Knowing one Muslim and one experience shouldn\u2019t represent every single Muslim\u2019s feelings on it. \n\nYes you should buy extra furniture because you can\u2019t eat without making a mess apparently. I mentioned the furniture not because of OP but because you specifically seem to having some messy eating issues.", "Wasn\u2019t talking about OP but this specific commenter can\u2019t eat properly.", "I\u2019m talking to you directly. I\u2019m sure OP can eat without making a mess, but I\u2019m asking YOU TO BUY THE TABLE because it seems you have some issues eating without making a mess.", "It\u2019s a rude request"]}
