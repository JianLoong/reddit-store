I moved in with him around 8 months ago. He has 8 kids. 2 adults sons in their 30s, who are married with kids, and 6 younger children ages 19m, 17m, 15f, 14m, 11f, 10m). \n\nDespite the fact none of his kids live with him he is very involved in their lives. One or a few of them regularly spend the night at our place (staying in the living room). His youngest son sleeps over almost every Thursday night and his 2 daughters sleepover almost every other weekend (they have different moms so it's more about spending time together then with their dad). His other kids + grandkids also intermittently spend the night.\n\nDuring the warmer months my boyfriend takes his sons camping a lot. It being winter, they haven't gone camping in in a few months. His youngest son especially loves camping and has been saying he misses camping and being with all his brothers. \n\nMy boyfriends has now told me next weekend his 4 younger sons plus his 2 oldests grandsons (13m, 11m) will be camping out in our living room. Not asked but TOLD. Because he thought I wouldn't have an issue with having 6 teen/pre-teen boys in my living room all weekend. \n\nWhen I told him I objected to his plans, he made it seem like I was only unhappy with it because I didn't want to be around his kids despite the fact I gave logical reasons why this was a bad idea. I also know I would end up cleaning up after them and making sure we have enough food for them ect. \n\nHonestly I'm not super comfortable around my boyfriend's kids and can be awkward with them. I also don't generally like it when any amount of them sleep over so I know next weekend will be awful for me. They can be loud, messy and generally don't like me much. They also take over my living room, which is inconvenient. \n\nMy boyfriend is mad at me for objecting, as is his daughter (15f) who was around when he told me his plans and my follow up objection. She thinks \"is it really any of your business though?\" My boyfriend pretty much agreed with her. I think it is my business as I live there too.\n\nDoes not wanting this sleepover to happen make me TA? Should I just be happy my boyfriend has a good relationship with his kids/grandkids?", "created_utc": 1676153988, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10zzmc6/aita_for_not_wanting_my_boyfriends_kids_to/", "score": 142, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
