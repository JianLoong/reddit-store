We had agreed to put 90% of our income into our joint account and 10% to keep for ourselves. I work FT while my husband only works once a week PT. He goes to school FT so his weekly income is only about $140. As per our agreement, then he keeps $14 per pay cheque and puts the rest in our joint account. \n\nHe does like to buy beer every week so I\u2019ve even added that on to our joint expenses so that he won\u2019t have to touch his personal money for it seeing as he doesn\u2019t make much at present. \n\nWell last week he made extra money so he told me he put $200 in our joint account. Today while we were going through our finances, I found out that from his last paycheque, he kept $50 for himself (and sent $200 to our joint acc) which is more than the 10% we agreed upon. (If he made $250 that week, he should only be keeping $25.)\n\nI told him I thought that wasn\u2019t fair since I always only keep 10% of my income and that even on occasions where I make less money, I keep less than the 10% so we wouldn\u2019t be short for our expenses (I don\u2019t ask him to do the same btw). I said we agreed on 10% and that\u2019s what he should do. He got mad about that and said, \u201cI\u2019ll just give you all the rest of my money then\u201d, sent the funds to me electronically, and stormed off the room.\n\nI got really pissed off at that because 1) that wasn\u2019t my point; I just wanted him to say sorry and that he will do what we had agreed on next week, 2) how is he the one getting mad at me when he was the one who didn\u2019t do what was agreed upon?!\n\nI sent him the money back and confronted him. I said, you don\u2019t get to be mad here when you were the one who didn\u2019t follow our agreement. I told him that he was making me feel like the bad person when he was in the wrong. We had an agreement and he should follow that.\n\nHe got really, really angry at this point. Started clenching his fists and shaking. Telling me to shut the fuck up multiple times, and that he sent me extra money already. I told him that\u2019s not the point, I don\u2019t want his money. He was wrong and he should own up to it. He flipped our side table over spilling everything that was on top of it. Then he started breaking down crying saying that I\u2019m always like this, I act so perfect all the time, and that I\u2019m breaking his peace and that I ruined our day. \n\nI told him sorry and to move aside so I can fix the shit he made on the floor. He told me he\u2019s not moving and he\u2019s like, \u201cyou really just don\u2019t want to let it go do you?\u201d. I told him, I don\u2019t want his money. I just want to hear him say \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll do what we agreed on next time\u201d. Then he says, \u201cwell you\u2019re not getting that from me\u201d.\n\nI know I am a perfectionist and am controlling at times, but we had an agreement that I felt should\u2019ve been followed. I didn\u2019t like the fact that he wanted to just shut me up by sending me money so that\u2019s why I kept bringing up the fact that we had an agreement which triggered his anger and made the fight worse.", "created_utc": 1677269195, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11b0njo/aita_for_telling_my_husband_hes_unfair_for/", "score": 256, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I mean, $14 a week?  He'll have to save up all month just to go out once with his friends.  And how much do you get personally a week to spend as you like?\n\nHe didn't do what he agreed to.  His outburst was frankly concerning.  But you are only giving your spouse $14 a week of his own, and it's understandable that he's frustrated by it.  That's cutting him off from the joint funds so extremely that we are getting very close to an uncomfortable situation because he basically has no money to use solely at his discretion and there is a massive power imbalance that is clearly being used against him.   \n\nYour agreement sucks.  Take 10% from both your incomes, pool it together, and then split that down the middle.  That's what each of you have to spend as you see fit.  But giving your spouse only $14 a week while you keep far more for your personal spending and then arguing over $25 isn't it, and I don't blame him for being angry about the entire arrangement.", "You're withholding quite a bit of information OP. I supported my wife while she was in school and I can't imagine confining her to 14$ per pay period while I had so much more from working full time. If you're struggling you tighten belts together and if you're doing well you share equally in a partnership.\n\nObviously his outburst isn't appropriate but it seems there's a deeper reason here.\n\nhonestly ESH at the moment until I hear more.\n\nEDIT:\n\nJust saw in your post history you're an ER nurse making 65-70K a year. that would put you at 125 a week or 500 a month of fun money vs his 14 or 56. Plus he's going back to school to be a HVAC tech and make better money that will benefit BOTH of you.\n\nYTA", "ESH  Because he makes so little, he gets almost no pocket money.  I didn\u2019t work for more than 10 years while I raised my son and my husband always gave me equal spending money.  To be fair, you should put 90% of your combined income together and split the combined 10% leftover equally. He shouldn\u2019t have reacted the way he did but your control over the finances is financial abuse.", "He only gets to keep $14 a week. Yikes", "INFO: is this the first time an argument between the two of you has become this intense? \n\nThis is not a healthy way of communicating. This isn't acceptable behavior. Table flipping is buck wild, much less hollering and shaking. \n\nEither there's something else happening in hubby's life that you're not aware of, or this relationship has an expiration date coming due.", "INFO:  Did he help support you when you went to school? How were finances split then?  When did he start school, and was it when this happened that you decided on this financial agreement?  What will be the agreement after he graduates and has a much larger contribution?\n\nWhat if you decide to then become a sahm, are you ok with only getting $\\`14 a week towards your play money since you aren't financially contributing?\n\nGoing to school fulltime is an investment in both your futures/financial here.\n\nSeparate 10pct of both incomes, split down the middle, since his going to school IS a future contribution.  \n\n$14 isn't but perhaps one lunch out a week, let alone for anything else.  \n\nI'm not sure I can automatically label him an abuser over this incident alone unless there is a history and this is common practice, there IS a thing also called reactive abuse-where the one throwing the tantrum just looses it after a very long build up of crazymaking, financial abuse, extremely controlling behavior from their spouse...and when they eventually snap, the real abuser stands back and easily points out that they are crazy.  So, based on just the one post, and his words towards you, it sounds like he's fed up being financially captive and you nitpicking when he had even returned the FULL amount, that still wasn't good enough for you.  He was pressed into a corner multiple times it seems.  I do suggest counseling for you both at this point.", "ESH. You're controlling, do you think? He has a temper, do you think? Your relationship is a ticking time bomb when tables are overturned over $25.00. You both need counseling ASAP and stop having blow outs over chump change because that's not really the issue anyway. Next time it will be how to properly install toilet paper - you say over, he says under, and more furniture is destroyed. That won't be the issue either. THE TWO OF YOU ARE THE ISSUE.", "INFO: how much money do you make? You both should be getting the same amount (or somewhat equal) amount of fun money. So if you\u2019re getting $20 a week and he\u2019s getting $14, then ESH. If you\u2019re getting $100+ a week to his $14, that\u2019s an easy YTA and it\u2019s bordering on financial abuse.", "Oh boy. I\u2019m going with ESH. \nHis reaction, assuming your depiction was accurate, was definitely on the red flag side and over the top. \nBut really? Over $25? Maybe he was saving to get you a gift. Maybe he wants new shoes or something for himself. \nHow long have you been married? Because as a veteran with 2 kids in the game, I\u2019ve learned that you have to pick which hills you want to die on. If it\u2019s a small issue that won\u2019t matter in a week, let it go and move on. Berating your husband, a grown adult, over $25 isn\u2019t going to create a lasting happy marriage.", "I think you\u2019re both TA. You are correct, he should hold up his end of the deal. But $14 a week? How would you like to only have $14 a week?\n\nMy finances are combined as well, but we don\u2019t do percentages. We each keep $50 a week for spending money, the joint account pays the bills and pays for household supplies (groceries, cleaning supplies etc) and what is left after that goes into savings. $14 a week is ridiculous, even if he only makes $140. If you\u2019re married, it\u2019s not your money and his money. ALL of the household income (and expenses) should belong to both of you. Maybe take 10% EACH of the TOTAL household income and out the rest into the joint account.", "YTA. \n\nDo you want to be right? Or do you want to fix it? \n\nBecause technically you are right. He broke an agreement that you made. However, the *agreement* is really one sided. \n\nDid you really never stop to think about the fact that he has less than $10 a week personal spending? My parents gave me more spending money as a teenager. Legit would hand me a $20 on the weekends to go out with my friends. \n\nAnd then you wouldn\u2019t let it go. Even when he was super upset, you kept pushing for an apology. That\u2019s messed up. Leave him alone. \n\nIf a husband followed his wife demanding an apology\u2014to the point where she flipped a table and was sobbing on the floor asking him to leave her alone, everyone would be screaming verbal and emotional abuse. This story is concerning for so many reasons. \n\nYou should seek therapy.

He shouldn\u2019t have lied or flipped out but Christ, $14 a week, can\u2019t blame him for being upset. You ever think there\u2019s more behind his outburst than just this disagreement.", "I\u2019m not sure if YTA or him, but your relationship does not sound healthy. Needs arent being met on either end. You said you work FT so I\u2019m guessing you bring in significantly more income. You both get 10% of your earnings, but is that fair if let\u2019s say you make $100k/year and he is only making $15k/year? He has a significantly lower spending budget which he may see as a problem. Maybe determine why he held onto the extra money? Meet him where he is, instead of coming at him. Does he feel he needs a bigger budget? What is he using this money for? \n\nHonestly though, as a married person, I feel like $25 isn\u2019t a hill I would want to die on. Choose your battles.", "ESH . I agree with a lot of the comments reminding you to pick your battles and work on the issues you said you have about perfectionism and control. Especially while your spouse is in school I think it makes sense to have a little bit of slack over the fun money. \n\nBut I also think your husband's reaction was way out of line. Violent men love to react with violent anger and then say they were \"pushed,\" which is just not true to reality. if he throws shit around when he's having a tantrum over $25 I really wouldn't want to see him in an actual high stress situation.\n\n I would say he's the bigger a-hole here for the violent outburst, that's a lot more worrying than nitpicking about $25. Though that is something you could work on, his behavior was worse.", "ESH \n\nYour agreement isn\u2019t fair because 14 dollars a week is nothing. But he shouldn\u2019t have lied about it and be sneaky.\n\nHe clearly has anger issues. But there is also a point where you should let something go ,for the moment, and let somebody cool down. And not keep going at it", "ESH- He should have told you but the guy gets $56 a month. Fifty-six dollars a month. That sucks.  As a spouse you guys need to be on the same team. Maybe ask him how much he feels he needs each week to not feel like he\u2019s struggling or missing out on things. And, if it works for finances, help him with that out of yours. He\u2019s going to school full time. At the same time, I go to college full time at 35, work full time, work twice a month at a bar, and also have 3 kids. So, maybe he needs to step it up a little too? \n\nSomething someone said always sticks in my mind when my husband and I have a conflict\u2026 and that\u2019s to remember that you are on the same team.\n\nEdit: Also, when you guys aren\u2019t arguing, I would ask him what caused him to react the way he did. I\u2019m assuming there is a root cause to his reaction that hasn\u2019t been addressed.", "ESH - this doesn\u2019t seem like a healthy marriage. He shouldn\u2019t be left with only $14 of spending money per week but he also shouldn\u2019t react violently in arguments", "YTA. Seems to me that you are financially abusing your husband", "ESH. He went against your agreement but your agreement seems fundamentally unfair. He only gets $14 per week. I\u2019m guessing you get much more than that. The one week he made extra money he thought it would be ok to keep a little extra since he was contributing more than usual even with keeping extra and you got upset and wouldn\u2019t let it go even after he transferred the extra to the joint account. You need a new system. Keeping the same percentage doesn\u2019t work when there is this much disparity. Try to put yourself in his shoes and think about how having only $14 per week would feel and then talk to him to find a sustainable agreement for finances.", "Decide on a flate rate pocket money amount that is the same for both of you. You are equal  partners, not proportional recipients.  Take a hard look at your controllong tendencies.  And if you're wondering if he will become physically abusive  --  too late.

I\u2019m all for joint budgeting but you should both get an equal amount of fun money, not have it determined by income.  It feels good when your income is higher but feels pretty bad when your income is lower.  Your partner is in school to hopefully earn more once they graduate, it\u2019s an investment not an opportunity to control them.  I don\u2019t like the fact that they had a breakdown but if they told you to shut up multiple times (also not good) that means you didn\u2019t leave them alone multiple times and instead kept badgering them about the already unfair financial arrangement.  You should learn that pausing a conversation is not the same as letting it go and you could have returned to the discussion at a later time.", "ESH, him for his extremely inappropriate reaction but you too, for the 10% rule in the first place. It\u2019s ridiculous if he\u2019s only making $140 a week. You KNOW he only has $14 a week with 10% and you\u2019re thinking that\u2019s ok? How much do YOU get to spend a week? Instead of a percentage right now, it should be a flat rate that you EACH get to keep. Choose the amount together. If you think $14 a week is fair then that\u2019s all you should be getting as well. Otherwise its like you\u2019re punishing him for being in school. You can always adjust to a percentage when you are on more equal footing income-wise.", "Wow.\n\nYou are abusing this man to the point that he is literally having a mental breakdown. And you don't even seem to care?\n\nYour \"fun money\" is literally a thousand percent more than his - Or more! You seem to acknowledge that there is literally nothing he can pay for on his \"allowance\" so you give him \"extras\" from the family budget, but give YOURSELF all of the control over what is spent. You're taking away all of his agency.\n\nLook, if you have a problem with working for your family while he is in school, that is something you can address. If you cannot handle it then initiate the divorce. But if you have agreed that he can be in school, then you need to pool your money and divvy up the fun money EQUALLY. If he wants beer, and extras, then he can pay for it from his fun money (if you don't drink or use those services, otherwise you should both pay). How is he supposed to save any money? His \"fun money\" is a like, single meal? He just never gets to save up money for bigger events/nicer things? It will take him TEN MONTHS of savings and not spending a single dollar to get... $140? No. And \"you didn't want his money\"? So you literally just wanted him to apologize for something you didn't want and didn't need?\n\nYTA. This is beyond unacceptable. The man kept $25. TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. You picked through the finances and saw that he kept $25 (when you get to keep hundreds), you followed him from room to room harassed him about how he didn't send you $25 that you clearly didn't need and hadn't been expecting, and when he sent you the money that was starting the argument...  you CONTINUED to harass him until he went from avoiding the fight to defensive and angry to a broken, crying mess.

I don't think that behaviour is OK and not cussing at your spouse either.

We had agreed to put 90% of our income into our joint account and 10% to keep for ourselves. I work FT while my husband only works once a week PT. He goes to school FT so his weekly income is only about $140. As per our agreement, then he keeps $14 per pay cheque and puts the rest in our joint account. \n\nHe does like to buy beer every week so I\u2019ve even added that on to our joint expenses so that he won\u2019t have to touch his personal money for it seeing as he doesn\u2019t make much at present. \n\nWell last week he made extra money so he told me he put $200 in our joint account. Today while we were going through our finances, I found out that from his last paycheque, he kept $50 for himself (and sent $200 to our joint acc) which is more than the 10% we agreed upon. (If he made $250 that week, he should only be keeping $25.)\n\nI told him I thought that wasn\u2019t fair since I always only keep 10% of my income and that even on occasions where I make less money, I keep less than the 10% so we wouldn\u2019t be short for our expenses (I don\u2019t ask him to do the same btw). I said we agreed on 10% and that\u2019s what he should do. He got mad about that and said, \u201cI\u2019ll just give you all the rest of my money then\u201d, sent the funds to me electronically, and stormed off the room.\n\nI got really pissed off at that because 1) that wasn\u2019t my point; I just wanted him to say sorry and that he will do what we had agreed on next week, 2) how is he the one getting mad at me when he was the one who didn\u2019t do what was agreed upon?!\n\nI sent him the money back and confronted him. I said, you don\u2019t get to be mad here when you were the one who didn\u2019t follow our agreement. I told him that he was making me feel like the bad person when he was in the wrong. We had an agreement and he should follow that.\n\nHe got really, really angry at this point. Started clenching his fists and shaking. Telling me to shut the fuck up multiple times, and that he sent me extra money already. I told him that\u2019s not the point, I don\u2019t want his money. He was wrong and he should own up to it. He flipped our side table over spilling everything that was on top of it. Then he started breaking down crying saying that I\u2019m always like this, I act so perfect all the time, and that I\u2019m breaking his peace and that I ruined our day. \n\nI told him sorry and to move aside so I can fix the shit he made on the floor. He told me he\u2019s not moving and he\u2019s like, \u201cyou really just don\u2019t want to let it go do you?\u201d. I told him, I don\u2019t want his money. I just want to hear him say \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll do what we agreed on next time\u201d. Then he says, \u201cwell you\u2019re not getting that from me\u201d.\n\nI know I am a perfectionist and am controlling at times, but we had an agreement that I felt should\u2019ve been followed. I didn\u2019t like the fact that he wanted to just shut me up by sending me money so that\u2019s why I kept bringing up the fact that we had an agreement which triggered his anger and made the fight worse.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Instead he opted to keep everything bottled up, letting his emotions fester which led to his angry outburst.", "The entire sub would be swimming in \"financial abuse\"", "I did read that wrong but I still think $14 a week is insane for fun money.", "If she gave him an equal amount of fun money then maybe they wouldn\u2019t have to take the beer out of the joint account.

Got it.", "Oh you mean by making assumptions and ignoring the actual facts? I\u2019m good, but thanks.", "All he had to do was communicate.

It would be tiring with all that alone, but to come home to a unsympathetic partner who only cares about the money aspect of things? Yikes.", "Wow, you sound toxic as hell. If your partner is that mad, the first thing you should do is give them SPACE. Let them calm down and allow yourself to calm down. The worst thing you could do is walk after them when they try to leave. They are trying to de-esculate the situation at that point because the emotions are too high. Emotions in a situation like this are never a good thing. Seriously, the reason he went into 'victim mode' was because she didn't give him a chance to cool down. She's also immature and selfish for not seeing her partners needs over some money that's not even that much to begin with. \n\nThis IS financial abuse. In today's economy, no one live off of 14 dollars, not even for play money. I highly doubt your opinion would remain the same...", "Because the amount he brings in is so small, they should be putting a certain percentage in the joint account and the rest split on need or evenly. His beer money should be in his personal money, rather than her allotting him a certain amount from the joint account. He has absolutely no way to accumulate anything. How could he even buy her a birthday present and what would that look like compared to what she can get him. In other words, they are not really combining their finances.", "Because she\u2019s getting $100+ a week and he\u2019s getting $14. \n\nIf he was a SAHD, do you think OP getting that much more is fair and not abusive?

Then he got so mad and frustrated that he flipped a table and cried. \n\nThese aren\u2019t the actions of someone who is abusively angry, this seems like someone who either thinks he has no option or literally has no option but to hide away a few extra dollars that he earned.", "She kept pushing for acknowledgment because he was dismissive\u2026.", "In one of her post from awhile back it says he\u2019s going to an HVAC school full time to better them financially.

I\u2019m just saying that I could see that take because she didn\u2019t let it go after he sent the money to her. I think the $14 spending money has him in a bad headspace, and now his wife is treating him like a child over $25. In this case and definitely not in every scenario, her insisting on an apology and acknowledgment that he was wrong (while he was clearly still upset) feels like her rubbing his nose in it, metaphorically like a shitty person rubbing a dog\u2019s nose in their urine when they go in the house. Maybe emasculating is a little too gendered, but humiliating might be more apt.\n\nEdit to Add: Putting myself in her shoes but being me, I would not come at my husband like this over such a small amount of money when he already has so little. We split our finances fairly, so if one of us is poor, we\u2019re both poor. If one of us has some extra cash, we both have extra cash. If someone wants to make a big purchase, we just talk about it and it\u2019s rarely a problem. Their \u201cagreement\u201d seems unfair to begin with, and they\u2019re both responsible for that.", "Actually, I was commenting on the issue not responding. There is a difference, yah know.\n\nIt seems you have reading comprehension issues.", "Maybe if she stopped controlling everything and made him feel like he could talk to her this wouldn't have happened.\n\nI know from experience what it's like to live with a controlling perfectionist. It is not easy to just \"talk\", they will make it into a \"Well this is your fault, nothing to do with me\" and give absolute bs reasons as to why I should feel bad. Even when is 100% their fault.\n\nWhy are you making out it's 100% his fault. I agree he shouldn't have had the outburst, but maybe if she acted less like his controlling parent and more like his SO he might actually feel confident to talk to her.", "When you're saving up for stuff, sometimes you have to make sacrifices in what you buy. He agreed to this split, if he doesn't like it, he should say so. She even said when she makes less money, she doesn't keep any, it all goes in the joint account, most likely because it has to in order to pay the bills. With that, it sounds like he's not really sacrificing a whole lot, and again, if he didn't like the arrangement, he should have said something or work more so he has more money.", "I could see that if a doctor specifically told me to go to a gym.", "He flipped the table and told her to shut up because he wanted to be alone and stop the argument. She pushed for the \"correct\" response because she wants to control the husband (she admits this). \n\nif you remove the gender roles I doubt you have that same opinion. just look at their actions not whats in their pants.", "No, she's abusive. Full stop. You should stop making excuses for her now.", "He probably wouldn\u2019t be in this situation without her, though.

He added extra money to the account when he got a bonus and kept $25 - 0.03% of the money OP earns in a year. She followed him around, admitted that it wasn\u2019t about the money and that she was more interested in an apology. He asked her to leave him alone, while visibly upset. \n\nShe didn\u2019t, and she broke the camels back. \n\nSomehow i think if husband was abusive, she wouldn\u2019t be chasing him around the house and hounding him about something as trivial as $25", "Communication doesn't work with abusers. A lot of you people are very naive.", "He's a victim of financial abuse and in this situation emotional abuse. You don't have to lift a finger to abuse a partner. She did a very good job hurting him.", "We don\u2019t know what happened prior, whether he did or did not attempt to communicate that this arrangement was untenable.", ">No one agrees to $14 a week until after they've been broken down by their abuser.\n\nWhy not? He already had his usual stuff covered by joint expenses. I'm not even sure what the point of this split is. I've also had my \"fun money\" down to 10 bucks a week due to the way I arranged my budgeting. If you have your \"mandatory fun\" covered by other buckets, it's not really an issue.", "Which is the case here, so why is this arrangement unfair to him? He gets supported during school with all of his basic living expenses paid covered, and all he has to pay is 90% of his pay. When I was in college, over 100% of my part time job pay went to living expenses, I lived off savings and loans.", "How is he living off of $14 if his bills are all paid plus some of his wants? He is not living off of $14 if his food, housing, clothing, gym membership, gas, weed, beer, etc. are accounted for in the joint budget. If he doesn\u2019t want to join finances, or if he doesn\u2019t like what they agreed to, he should say something and not throw a tantrum. \n\nYes chasing after your spouse when the leave a room is escalating the situation, but I have a problem with his lack of communication in this situation. Why didn\u2019t he say he earned more and would like to keep a bit more? Like I said, it\u2019s not financial abuse. He agreed to that plan to save money, and at no point was it mentioned that he stated he had an issue with it. She is not preventing him from getting a full time job or telling him what to do with his 10%. She hasn\u2019t even asked that he sacrificed his 10% when she\u2019s had to sacrifice hers. TBH I would be complaint about having $14 a week when literally everything else is paid for.", "That's actually a really good point. Thanks for sharing", "Hm I see what you're saying. Maybe a better solution would be to have an equal amount of fun money for each person. I generally see marriage as an equal sharing of money, so i guess it is weird to split it so unequally.", "Yeah but it sounds like almost everything he wants is being paid for out of the joint account so that does extend the $14 a month. She's paying all her fun stuff out of her own fun money fund and not the joint account.", "And then behaved violently and aggressively toward OP when she confronted him.\n\nMy exh would do that shit, ball up his fists, shake, punch walls when he didn't get his way, it was a quiet way of inferring that I was \"next.\"", "Sometimes the best thing to do when you're angry is remove yourself from the situation, which he did. She followed him. Yes he could've said he didn't want to talk at that moment, but with how pushy OP makes herself out, I doubt she would've listened.", "It\u2019s not like he slept with her sister or murdered the family dog. He kept $25 bucks. And whose to say, he wasn\u2019t gonna make up the difference next pay?

I maintained Dean's list and graduated with honors for all 3 degrees. I never dropped below 15 credits a semester (12 is FT, max is 18 without special approval). \n\nHe can work more than 1 day while going to school.

She admits that she\u2019s controlling and a perfectionist, so how often does she control his life in this way? He took, albeit spoken for, his money and returned the the amount that was left. He shouldn\u2019t need to explain every single minor deviation, especially when she\u2019s getting 10x in fun money than him.
