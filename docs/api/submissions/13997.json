I was on vacation and busy so I wasn\u2019t able to claim it yet (I believe they give you a month of buffer room to claim it). I got an email yesterday from Sephora telling me that my gift was claimed in the city my ex (28F) lives in.\n\nI reached out to her and asked her not to use my account anymore through my phone number. She said she was sorry and that she wouldn\u2019t do it again. I looked up the cost of the birthday gift and it was around $30, so I asked her to Venmo me the $30. She told me she didn\u2019t owe me anything because it was a free gift and I didn\u2019t claim it so she did, to not let it go to waste.\n\nI told her it was not about the money, it was about the principle of the issue that she shouldn\u2019t be taking other people\u2019s gifts (especially not an ex who she has no contact with) and that I would be expecting my $30. She started cussing me out, calling me a cunt, and telling me that I was childish. I contacted Sephora already to change my security settings (set up 2FA).\n\nAdditionally I could have given the gift to a friend or my girlfriend who I know would have wanted it. My friends are all on my side but I\u2019m wondering if I could be the asshole because I didn\u2019t really want the gift, and it WAS free, until she claimed it.\n\nAITA for asking for the money for my gift ($30) that I might not have even wanted?", "created_utc": 1680623285, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12bn46h/aita_for_requesting_money_for_a_stolen_birthday/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
