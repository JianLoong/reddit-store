For appearance sake they are not allowed to tape over or write in price changes. \nYrs the employee could have told you but maybe is not engaged or thoughtful enough to do so. \nThere should be a health certificate or business license prominently displayed; you could address your complaint to the entity thereon.", "Nta It was honest. People need to know. I'm Neuro typical, but that would get under my skin", "NTA. You\u2019re right, they literally are not allowed to do that. And considering the owner\u2019s response wasn\u2019t \u201cSorry! We\u2019re updating our menus tomorrow\u201d, I\u2019m guessing they fully intend light fleecing of their customers, relying on no one to kick up a fuss over .50 cents.", "NTA\n\nThe price displayed was deceptive. For that alone, your bad review was reasonable. The employee also tried to deny that it was deceptive (by pretending the difference was all tax) and made no apology or assurance that the menu will be updated soon, so more reason for a bad review.\n\nI live in a country where prices displayed must always include tax, so I always know the final price, I don't have to do arimethic in my head to figure it out, so I would also take exception to the pretax price being displayed at all, but I understand from your post that this part was normal for you.", "They told you it was more at checkout after you challenged them.\n\nThey are dishonest and the review was justified. \n\nNTA", "Nta. Take a screen shot, tell him it's been screen shotted, thank him for admitting he did exactly that, and that you have forwarded this information to the local licensing Bureau for review.\n\nThen again, I'm an asshole and love letting people know to expect trouble coming from their own bad actions", "NTA", "NTA if they changed the price, they need to change the sign. I would not have paid the wrong amount.", "NTA, probably? I find the american culture of explicitly Listing the before Tax price but then Charge the with-tax price, confusing, in that context it MIGHT be appropriate? Anyway it IS dishonest to Charge more than the displayed price If that usually/previously was the total charged price. If the law in your state says price has to be listed a certain way, then it's appropriate to complain in a Review about how that wasn't kept to. If a Caf\u00e9 Manager makes the decision to increase prices, it's their responsibility to both Update the Menus and instruct the service workers about how to Talk about it. Which, this sounds Like even the one-of-the-owners Guy didn't quite know what was as going on, Nor that that wasn't legal.", "NTA. It's their responsibility to change the listed prices by the time they come into effect so that customers are not put in the situation you are in. Nothing to do with being ND, in this case (and I speak as an ND person).", "NTA, report them to Weights and Measures. If they don't fix their practice of charging more than listed, they will be severely fined.", "ESH\n\nYou were right to bring up the difference, but took way too much effort to call out a small business in an attempt to harm them over $0.50. If they really did recently raise their prices calling it a 'Bait and Switch' is disingenuous as they're probably waiting for new signage. If you were truly ONLY concerned with making sure people knew about the price increase your review would have been one, MAYBE two sentences: \n\n\"Product costs $0.50 more than posted because they recently raised their prices. Please update your signage to reflect that\"\n\nYou might think 'oh well they shouldn't raise their prices if the posted price doesn't match' and I get it, but if you're a small business and you have to wait 4-8 weeks for new signage to be made and delivered, the choice between 'Lose money for two months with no way to recoup it' and 'Increase prices now and inform customers when they ask while you wait for new signage' is pretty obvious.  \n\nAnd $5000 a month isn't exactly a lot when it comes to a small business. Especially if you're making up sales numbers. Which you ARE.  If I was the owner / worker I probably would have comped the difference if you were polite about it, but based on the fact that you went to all this effort because of an extra $0.50 on a cinnabon you probably weren't.\n\nFinally, don't use being neurodivergent as an excuse to not know when to pick your battles. It's insulting to the effort other neurodivergent people like me put in to make sure that we react to situations accordingly and fairly. Other things like stating you walked four blocks each way (the *horror)* and that you can get a bigger one somewhere else just tell me you're fishing for sympathy and trying everything you can to swing opinion in your favor.\n\nEdit: do me a favor and actually tell me why this is a bad take instead of just downvoting it", "YTA, but only because $0.50 has taken up so much of your time and energy. \ud83d\ude02", "ESH - they were wrong. This is a petty thing to let bother you and publicly shame them for. You were misled for a total of the wait in line by a very small thing. I get that they're wrong, but you're blowing this out of a reasonable proportion taking about \"illegal\" this and massive scale scam that.", "NTA. He only told you it was more because you asked.", "You are definitely NTA, but I would have taken it a step further and filed a complaint with your state\u2019s Attorney General and give the owner something to cry really about.", "EAH. And I truly mean everyone. Your whole dam country and the price without tax system. Why is that normalised? Why did I see a sign saying 2$ for a cold drink, get inside and pay with my crispy two dollarydoos only to have the resister ring up and blah blah cents. \"oh that's just tax\" OK SO BLOODY WELL PUT THAT ON YOUR SIGN.\n\nAhem.. In less insane terms, you have every right to poorly review a place too lazy to change the prices.\n\nIn my country it's a crime not to display the actual full price. None of this sneaky tax added after bs you people seem to think is normal. I'm just going to stop because this is unhinging me.", "Transparency is a key aspect that makes society work. Trust is another. Charging more than the menu says violates both trust and transparency.

NTA!", "I used to own part of a restaurant.\n\nCharging more than what's on the menu is thoroughly bogus and yes, the restaurant should get slammed for that. It is, in fact, bait and switch and it is illegal in many places.\n\nFurther, I'd worry that if they can't take care of this basic thing, what other basic things (like food safety) are they also unable to handle.\n\nAnd, no, informing people verbally only at the time of checkout is not sufficient.", "This will get down voted because redditors are nothing if not both wildly broke and wildly pedantic, but who gives the fuck about 50 cents?

However, I\u2019ve seen totally annoying circumstances result from reviews, so doing one for $0.50 seems to be more trouble than it\u2019s worth.  Plus - even a Reddit post.  I would just not go there anymore, but that\u2019s just me.  But I get it, OP is out for principle."]}
