He knew they were \u201cpale red\u201d when he bought them. They didn\u2019t change color with your comment.\nI am curious if you said the shirt would match his jeans in any kind of snarky way, but even if you did it wouldn\u2019t change my opinion. You didn\u2019t actually say anything mean about them and guys wear pink (aka faded red) all the time.", "Rose gold(en)?", "A person of culture I see.", "Yes, but he does get weirded out when he discovers that these are the clothes Bulma left him, he goes \"these garments that you left, are they for a man or a woman? They're PINK!\" and then thinks to himself \"Men in pink! How bizarre!\"\n\nImportant to keep in mind that DBZ was released in the late 80's-early 90's so attitudes on the color have changed, in my adult life I don't really recall any man refusing to wear pink", "The association of pink = feminine and blue = masculine happened a lot earlier than Hitler/Naziism.\n\nFrom what I've read the switch happened around 1900 to 1920 and may have been driven by department stores/fashion starting to dress female babies in pink and boys in blue in displays and magazines.\n\nBefore that time pink was considered a masculine color as it was close to red and red was a \"warlike\" color. Besides the religious association with Mary there was also some thought that blue was feminine because it was a \"cold\" color like how people thought women behaved.", "I know a few unfortunately, especially in my office when I still had to go in. I have many pink shirts they are some of my favorites!", "yes, there were a few factors at play, but that does not mean there is zero correlation with the nazi's pink triangles. & the fact that pink is still considered a masculine colour by many countries that were not involved in wwii does point to a connection between this change of social association & the war.", "[removed]", "Yet there is no proof of it in any fashion history or otherwise.
