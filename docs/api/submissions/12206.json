Why would YOU have to reimburse him?\n\nYou're not making him NOT wear the jeans....\n\n>Caden is very obsessed with seeming masculine, and he takes a lot of pride in his personal style\n\nSoooooo why doesn't he want to wear the jeans? It's his \"personal style\" right? Nope, he's trying to act \"bigger\" than he actually is.\n\nJust wear the damn jeans mate, who gives a fuck if they are pink......\n\nYOU like it, WEAR IT!!!!\n\nStop trying to act masculine and start being YOU!!\n\nNTA", "NTA\nIf he doesn't think his jeans are pink, why won't he wear them?

You can take a picture of the jeans under a white light, then open that picture in an image tool (e.g ms paint) and use its colour picker tool to get the colour code. \n\nThen agree on a definition (e.g: red being #ff0000 and rose pink being #ff66cc - https://encycolorpedia.com/ff66cc), and see which colour the jean's is closer to.", "NTA.
