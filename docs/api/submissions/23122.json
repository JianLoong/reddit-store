Has nothing to with capablitles or anything I just get extremely uncomfortable. \n\nWe have a new hire that has been trying to get to know people around the office better, and I happen to just excuse myself when she comes around. Thankfully I work in the field a lot so I am often alone. So it does not happen often, but when I do come to the office she keeps trying to befriend or talk to me. I am civil and polite I say hello, and can handle idle chit-chat, even if it is visibility uncomfortable for me. \n\nShe brought this up with my friend in the office and he explained the situation, and since then it seems she has made it her mission to have me open up. On Friday I asked if she could leave me alone please, that I have no intention to become her friend or open up. \n\nShe lashed out and called me a misogynistic asshole. I thought it over the weekend and it has been racking my brain. Am I really the asshole for not wanting to put myself in uncomfortable situations if I can avoid it. \n\nIf I have to take her out in the field or help explain my drafts I will push through, since it is work related. I still get uncomfortable but it is what it is. Those are situations I cannot avoid, but general interactions I do not think it is wrong of me to limit those when possible. \n\nOn the other hand, I also understand this is a me problem, I go to therapy but that only does so much. This is something rooted in trauma and I am not comfortable writing about it. She should not be punished for my own issues.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nUpdate: \n\nThanks for all the replies was not expecting this many. I am going to talk my boss about this since we have to head up to NY. So we can talk about this on the drive to the airport. \n\nI do not want to bring this up with HR cause I do not want her to get reprimanded or writen up over a first offense. I will see what my boss has to say. She is a talented drafter, I do not want to lose her over this. \n\nI will provide an update after this week. I hope we can agree to let it go.", "created_utc": 1690305566, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/159erd3/aita_for_asking_a_female_coworker_if_they_could/", "score": 610, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have a right to decline to engage in personal conversations, but you acknowledge yourself that when she comes around you walk away and you treat her differently because she\u2019s a woman. That\u2019s where you became an issue. If you\u2019re unpleasant to everyone and refuse to speak personally with everyone, that\u2019s totally fine, but you are genuinely describing singling her out. That is a problem, it\u2019s against nearly every workplace policy and you can get in huge trouble for it. \n\nFurther to that, the historic and current oppression women face does matter, even if your intentions aren\u2019t misogynistic. Imagine if you were doing this to a POC, it would and should be a huge red flag to your employer and opens them up to liability. You are free to avoid whoever you like in your personal life, but at work you have to do your level best to treat everyone the same. You can be antisocial to everyone, or you can stop being antisocial to her specifically. She also shouldn\u2019t attempt to be your friend, that\u2019s why she sucks. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to be friends with anyone, but again, you are singling her specifically out for an immutable and protected characteristic, by your own admission. This is not okay in a workplace. You\u2019ll have to find another way to be comfortable and at least polite. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I work in HR and the specific violations are under harassment, anti-bullying, and anti-discrimination policy. You may want to check what your employer and state say specifically but I know nearly every training I have given and taken has mentioned singling someone out, especially for sex, race, sexual orientation, disability or perceived reproductive status, as a HUGE no-no. \n\nEdit: and yes, these rules do extend to non-work related conversations. If I\u2019m talking to three people at the water cooler and every time you come around I end the conversation and disperse the group by being \u201cvisibly uncomfortable\u201d - I am singling you out. I would still be subject to anti-bullying discipline. Which is fair honestly. If you\u2019re professional to someone but make every \u201cgood morning\u201d a living hell for them, it is a problem that affects their ability to do their job. It\u2019s not high school where you\u2019re allowed to have cliques where people are made to feel not included. Funnily enough, these rules are a result of women being locked out of promotions and similar perks because they weren\u2019t included in boys clubs. So cliques are taken seriously in many workplaces, and should be.", "Info: uncomfortable how? Why?", "OP, will not pass judgment since this seems to be fueled by trauma. \n\nThat being said, ask yourself this how would your reason fly if it was against another protected class? \n\n\"I cannot be around POC because or a past trauma.\" Does not fly.", "I would try being around women for a short period of time each day, maybe 1 or 2 minutes. Be pleasant, make polite conversation, and then leave. You can do this until you start to feel a bit more comfortable, or at least get better at being polite and making small talk about whatever, the weather, etc. Once you feel more confident, you can lengthen the time by a minute or 2. Women are 51% of the population, so you need to, at the very least, become adept at making brief small talk and general politeness.", "YTA, women are people. Calling them \u201cfemales\u201d is so crude. WOMEN ARE PEOPLE. Ffs. Agree with others who recommend therapy. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened to you, but it\u2019s not normal.

It sets them back in office politics and it leads to them being passed over for promotions that they are deserving of.\n\nWhile at work you need to work to overcome your hang ups.

Are you going to only work jobs where you don\u2019t deal with women for the rest of your life? \n\nRemember when Mike Pence refused to be alone with women in a professional setting?

You obviously have a lot of issues.. good luck with all that", "Mike Pence, is that you?", "YTA\n\nYou purposefully avoid as much as possible any female interaction, it's impossible not to read your behavior as misogynistic.\n\nHow do you expect to advance in your career without interacting with women? You have a serious problem you need to work out.", "YTA, only because you claim your discomfort is gender related. If you treat people equally, it wouldn't be an issue, you have a right to privacy and are not obligated to have personal conversations with coworkers.", "This sounds like something you need to unpack with your therapist.", "NTA.   You are being polite.  You are being professional.  You are willing to put aside your discomfort for work purposes and basic manners.  \n\nWhat is really rude is someone who knows you have a problem making it their mission (without any real information no less!) to make you change.  That has nothing to do with work and is super unprofessional on her part.", "NTA. As Long as you are polite and respectful when you do interact with women then I see no reason you should feel like an ass. \n\nYou aren\u2019t required to befriend anyone no matter their gender, color, religion or sexuality. \n\nAnd as you said, you are already in therapy. \n\nJust keep being polite and professional and you\u2019ll do fine.", "This is work.

If a female had a coworker who is Male, and the male knew the female was uncomfortable with them and their attempt to be friends, yet kept forcing the situation on the female, making them uncomfortable on purpose,  the woman wouldn't be accused of misanthropy because she asked him to leave her alone.\n\nNTA.  Go to HR and explain the situation and that a coworker explained things and she doubled down then accused you of misogyny after you politely asked her to stop.  You are at work and would like to keep things professional.", "Switch the genders around and this thread would be all over her for stalking him. \n\nOP performs his job related tasks. She\u2019s harassing him. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nI understand you recognize that you are uncomfortable and it's good you're getting therapy to handle these uncomfortable situations. But you've asked your colleague politely to desist, and she overreacted violently. I'll take you at your word that you were polite but I wonder if an impartial observer (or HR) would view your behavior similarly.\n\nI would take this to your supervisor to inform them that you feel uncomfortable being singled out by your colleague to be a \"project\" to change your personality, but you will professionally engage in any/all things you need to do a satisfactory job. However, I think unfortunately it might be a challenging environment to do your job well if you need to engage this colleague a lot, because the line between being \"socially open\" and \"professional engagement\" is often quite vague. Most bosses care that work gets done, and is low drama -- and unfortunately you right now are in a position to have your work quality hampered by this issue, fairly or not.\n\nI think I would judge if you have an open/sympathetic boss that you'll be okay -- but they could side with your colleague, especially since she's female (and seemingly could hold a grudge). Just be aware of the political environment you're in and be on the lookout for ways to limit your contact with this employee, potentially transferring to another dept etc.\n\nIF you feel that you can manage this and your boss agrees, I would also consider talking to the colleague, and saying you meant no offense but you generally do not socialize at work though you appreciate her professionally. I would only do this is you feel the issue was just a misunderstanding AND you have support from your boss.\n\nAlso, you really need to keep private that \"you are uncomfortable around women\" - never, ever say this in a work environment. Ever. To anyone. That alone is almost immediate grounds for termination, no matter how much it is a mental health issue you are dealing with.

You aren't required to be anyone's buddy outside of that. I worked for the same company for fifteen years. Focused on my tasks, climbed the ladder, and when I got bored, I moved on. Never went to a holiday party, happy hour, baby shower, kid's graduation, or anything not required by the standards of my job.\n\nThat said, you'll have to get ahead of this and speak to HR about this coworker before she tries to lay a paper trail about you. I've encountered too many whiny idiots who think they're being \"discriminated\" against just because you don't want to be their friend.

HR involvement kind of wrong.  \n\nYour friends have already tried to help.  Talk to your manager next, and see if they can intervene, and get her to stop thinking she has to befriend everyone in the office.  If that doesn't do it, file an HR complaint for harrassment.

Stomp on peoples boundaries, bully others for their own gratification etc. I bet she was drooling internally thinking about how she was going to tell everyone about when you told her to leave you alone. \n\nAnd what you said was not rude.

Has nothing to with capablitles or anything I just get extremely uncomfortable. \n\nWe have a new hire that has been trying to get to know people around the office better, and I happen to just excuse myself when she comes around. Thankfully I work in the field a lot so I am often alone. So it does not happen often, but when I do come to the office she keeps trying to befriend or talk to me. I am civil and polite I say hello, and can handle idle chit-chat, even if it is visibility uncomfortable for me. \n\nShe brought this up with my friend in the office and he explained the situation, and since then it seems she has made it her mission to have me open up. On Friday I asked if she could leave me alone please, that I have no intention to become her friend or open up. \n\nShe lashed out and called me a misogynistic asshole. I thought it over the weekend and it has been racking my brain. Am I really the asshole for not wanting to put myself in uncomfortable situations if I can avoid it. \n\nIf I have to take her out in the field or help explain my drafts I will push through, since it is work related. I still get uncomfortable but it is what it is. Those are situations I cannot avoid, but general interactions I do not think it is wrong of me to limit those when possible. \n\nOn the other hand, I also understand this is a me problem, I go to therapy but that only does so much. This is something rooted in trauma and I am not comfortable writing about it. She should not be punished for my own issues.\n\nSo AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I can handle of this, not easily but I can. \n\nMy issue is more so around water-cooler talk, I do not feel it is unreasonable of me to avoid such interactions when possible.

I\u2019m not saying you have to be best friends with this woman or any woman but this isn\u2019t acceptable behavior. I can understand why she is trying to ingratiate herself with her fellow coworkers. Engineering is a male dominated field and is fairly notorious in STEM for having a lot of sexism towards women. It\u2019s an issue if you avoid women in your workplace because it has the potential to deny them important work opportunities. If you had the choice to work with a man or woman who were both equally qualified on a project you\u2019d probably choose the man to avoid being uncomfortable.

It\u2019s good that you\u2019re seeking help for your trauma but it sounds like you still need to learn to cope better. One thing that may be useful is exposure therapy. Talk to your therapist for ways to implement this technique in a safe environment. A support group for trauma might also be worth looking into. If the physical presence of women makes you feel uncomfortable, maybe you could start talking to someone on zoom. Alternatively, after talking with your therapist about it, maybe invite a friend who has a partner to go watch a movie. There may be less socializing during the movie but it could give you a chance to feel more comfortable in the presence of women. It may also be worth talking to your therapist about whether they think you may be a good candidate for medication if you\u2019re not taking some already. It won\u2019t magically fix the situation and medication can take a lot of trial and error to find the correct dosage and meds but it can be helpful for some people.
