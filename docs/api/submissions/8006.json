She\u2019s jealous her son isn\u2019t tapping her apparently", "She knows that everyone will say DILa cake tastes better", "How optimistic of you to think she\u2019ll be allowed anywhere near her grandchildren. Her son and DIL will have gone no-contact by that point\u2026 and I can understand why. \n\nOp: I am a mother to a grown up son. Why can\u2019t you understand that he does not belong to you. You don\u2019t have first place in his life. He is an individual with his own life and his own family. You are driving him away with your pathetic, petty jealousy. It\u2019s ridiculous and sad.\n\nGet a grip, get your own life, and apologise to your DIL and son. Hopefully you haven\u2019t yet driven them away for good.", "She is a just no MIL for sure \ud83e\udd23", "Isn't that what a throwaway is? An account made specifically on one day for posting here under anonymity?", "Also YTA cause it\u2019s literally GREG\u2019S BIRTHDAY. And you\u2019re calling it your event. Grow up. This behavior is narcissistic, controlling, and honestly a little pathetic.", "https://i.etsystatic.com/5126601/r/il/78f406/3952082880/il_570xN.3952082880_1376.jpg", "I try \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01", "Nothing goes trough to people like this", "Could just be about impressing her own friends and using her son as an accessory and his birthday as an excuse. I wonder what he thinks about the guest list.", "YTA, and agree.  Greg clearly has a sense of diplomacy that he clearly didn't get from his mother.  Greg was nice enough to say he wanted his mother's cake too, when reading between the lines he only wanted Lima's.  OP is just going to have to push harder to show her son his wife is inferior to his mother.", "Pretentious cake of hatred! Man I love this!", "If she gets a professional cake it could have disgusting fondant to look nice.  She doesn't want people to all eat Lima's cake.", " I hope he's a no-show and just let's his wife make his birthday dinner and cake.", "I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I later saw the DIL post in JustnoMIL cause this sounds exactly like the start of JustNo behaviour", "The making his favorite childhood cake is quite the tell\u2026", "This is exactly all it is. Upset that his wife does something better than she did all 26 years of her son\u2019s life. Id rather eat a lopsided but delicious cake vs a fancy looking one that has no flavor and fondant thats 5 inches thick on cake that\u2019s as dry as Amy Schumers humor.", "Imo, its more about everything looking picture perfect than about op being territorial over son. \n\nIt is awful when a host is so anal retentive that they'll put asthetics above wishes of the honoree. This usually leads to a stressful, unfun party.\n\nHowever, it's bizzaro that son/dil are digging their heels in so hard. OP's being annoying, but its not that big a deal.\n\nDil can still make a cake for husband for them to enjoy at home. Next year they can host themselves and can refuse OP's contributions.", "How absolutely nasty.  YTA", "I thought the same thing!  Like an Aunty wanting to make a cake for her nephew.  Gack.  This is a Mom getting between her son and his new wife.  Very nasty.  Hopefully she'll see this AITA thread and choose a different path.", "Same.  OP, YTA.", "That'd be awesome. OP is throwing the party for all the wrong reasons. Not to celebrate her son's birthday but to maintain her fa\u00e7ade that she's still relevant and the dominant female in his life.", "Yep. Disgusting.", "I\u2019d rather have a cake that tastes good than looks pretty!!!!  But I wouldn\u2019t object to a party that had both.  \n\nMy 4 kids had fancy cakes for their B\u2019nai mitzvah. The first two were beautiful and tasted decent, from fancy bakeries. (Sculpted to reflect the kids\u2019 interests, they looked cool, tasted like ordinary cake) The next one was the \u201cstandard hotel bar mitzvah cake\u201d that the hotel the party was at offered, it looked fine, perfectly attractive, meant to look like a scroll but nothing particularly fancy. (My MIL had arranged for the cakes, but was recovering from an injury, so we went the easy way).  It was absolutely DELICIOUS.  My was offered a couple flavors, and oh, my, did she choose well.  I vividly remember how good it was.  Best tasting cake of the lot.  The last kid had a fancy sculpted cake.  A 3-D deer.  It tasted fine, but, oh was it UGLY. So ugly it was hilarious!   The bakery screwed up and my SIL submitted a photo to cake wrecks, and they published it.  So, that ugly cake is the one everyone remembers!!! My son was delighted!", "Most of the posts here are fake too", "That cake shrew looks quite jealous", "Maybe but her whole post drips as disdainful of her DIL, it's icky and sounds snobby at best.", "Honestly, even if it looks like a child made it (which I strongly doubt), it doesn't matter, there's two cakes, her apparently very nice looking one and one that nobody has to eat from but people likely will because it's tasty.", "I\u2019m lucky to have found a family owned bakery that has both- looks gorgeous and tastes delicious. I remember going to order my wedding cake and it turned out the owner went to HS with my (now) ex FIL. Ended up with an extra tier and a ton of extra sugar flowers all over", "Food isn\u2019t a competition??? Have you met my MIL? Lol. I have been forbidden from bringing food over to her house because what I bring is always better than what she has and no one eats her food, but mine will be all gone when the event is over.", "More cake for later. That's a win-win for sure.", "Or they can have smaller slices of each!  Yea! Bonus cake.", "Exactly.  I love cake but I'm quite fussy about it and if there is no choice it's always a bit disappointing if it is one I'm not keen on.  Different people have varying tastes, and that's OK.", "My wedding cake was a chocolate source cream cake with chocolate frosting.  Everyone gave me grief, \u201cyou can\u2019t have chocolate frosting for a wedding cake\u201d. I told **I** could.  It had pink fresh flowers for the decoration. It was pretty and looked delicious. It was.  But I only got a couple bites, sometime wanted me for something, I put down the plate, and then things happened and we left\u2026My daughter, at her wedding, was paranoid she wouldn\u2019t get cake, because of my sad story, and vigorously protected her cake eating time!!!!  \n\nBut, it\u2019s amazing how wonderful a chocolate frosted cake with simple shell edging and pink flowers looks.  All the nay sayers told me they were wrong. It was one of the best wedding cakes they had ever seen.  And I know it\u2019s because they WANTED TO EAT IT.", "Yeah, I'm fully on the same page. OP just sounds exhausting tbh.", "Admittedly I'd be a bit sad if I tried hard to make something nice and nobody would touch it. So to some extent I actually feel sorry for your MIL. But that wouldn't be the fault of somebody who brings nice food. \n\nMaybe she should somehow learn to cook or invite you to prepare some food together or just let you take care of food and she can do decorations, drinks, invitation cards etc and then you'll have a hell of a party on your hands.", "This is exactly what i think MIL is worried about lol. Which means she must know she's not very good!"]}
