It\u2019s his birthday, it should be about him not you.", "YTA. As some others have said. Cut the cord. If it\u2019s your event don\u2019t pretend you\u2019re doing it for your son. If it is your son\u2019s day then let him choose. If he wants both cakes then so he should. You\u2019re being mean and a snob. Who care if the cake doesn\u2019t look good or elegant enough for you as long as it\u2019s delicious.", "YTA.  And will become an increasingly lonely one.", "It looks like you cared more about your cake than your son's or DIL's feelings. It's just a cake.", "Your son is telling you he wants his wife to bake his birthday cake and you're ignoring that because it doesn't look nice? Sounds like an event for you and not your son.\n\nYTA", "YTA and the only one \u201cmaking a huge scandal\u201d out of nothing. Your son wants his wife to bring a cake. It\u2019s his birthday. Get over yourself.", "YTA\n\nWho cares if her cake is not up to your esthetic standards?\n\nYour son (the birthday boy) wants her to make a cake and bring it to the celebration.\n\nLet her bring her cake and if anyone is rude enough to say anything about how it looks, tell them Greg wanted Lima to make a cake as well.    \n\nI sincerely hope that the people invited to this celebration are not as judgemental as you are.  If they are, I hope they have the courtesy NOT to say anything negative about the cake.\n\nGood Luck", "YTA- you are making this \u201cevent\u201d about YOU and created the scandal. Did you ask Greg what he wants? Does he want a fancy party? \n\nLima is his wife and should most definitely be part of the planning. You need to apologize to both and allow Lima to bring the cake that both her and Greg want.", "YTA and a huge one.", "YTA. Cut the cord. Greg is a grown man whose married. You don\u2019t like his wife and you don\u2019t have to, but he wants his wife\u2019s cake at his birthday party. You\u2019re more worried about how fancy everything looks then you are your own son\u2019s happiness.", "YTA. This is how families end up in tatters. How the cake looks shouldn't matter, that's pretty petty. You should've compromised. It's his birthday. And you need to learn how to share and have healthy relationships with both your son and your new DIL.", "YTA and unless this is an event to be broadcast from Buckingham Palace or catered by the best company in your entire country, your event is just not that important to be worried about what you call \"esthetics.\"  Is it a family event out of love for your son and the life he has built, or is it your look at ME ME ME ME event?  Seriously, who cares that much about how a delicious cake looks?  Some of the tackiest parties I've ever attended were planned by people like you and all they talked about was how tasteful they were, lol.  Tacky and trashy are not about appearance as much as they are about behavior, and you're being incredibly tacky and trashy to your son's new wife.  Let her bake and bring her cake, and when you do that, feel yourself growing up a little bit, and maybe let your Grinch's heart no longer be two sizes too small?", "YTA. It\u2019s your sons birthday, he gets the cake he wants- and he wants his wife\u2019s cake.", "So, your son, who\u2019s the birthday guy, said he wanted her to bake him a cake, but OP doesn\u2019t want HER event aesthetically ruined. If I were son, I\u2019d skip mom\u2019s event and celebrate with Lima. Who cares if it doesn\u2019t meet her plating and presentation standards. What matters is that Greg enjoy the things he likes and shares them with others. \n\nIs there also a dress code, OP? Black tie event? YTA", "YTA.\n\nThis event is your way of asserting your control over your adult son that you feel you just \u201clost\u201d to his marriage.\n\nIt\u2019s not about celebrating his birthday, or about meeting any of his actual wishes (his desire to have his wife\u2019s cake at the event). It\u2019s so blatantly selfishly about *YOU*, your nostalgic memories making this \u2018sentimental cake\u2019that all you\u2019re hoping to do here is \u201cshow his wife he\u2019a still yours\u201d, using his birthday as an excuse.", "It's not YOUR event. It's HIS birthday.\n\nYTA. Wow.", "Gossshhh, OP YTA. Lima\u2019s husband is a grown man. No longer mommy\u2019s little boy. \n\nTell me you don\u2019t like Lima. Without tell me you don\u2019t like her. Goshh, you raised your son. Please allow Lima to celebrate her husband.", "YTA\n\nThis is not your party and your son should get what he wants in this case", "YTA", "YTA - Your son is a grown man, yet you disrespect his wishes for his wife to make a cake for him?\n\nOP, what is your problem?", "YTA. You\u2019re right it\u2019s not her birthday, but it is HIS birthday, and if he wants her cake for HIS birthday, then he should be able to have it. The only person who seems to have a problem with it is you! You sound like an unbearable MIL. The sooner you learn that he will be having his wife\u2019s back from now on the better, or you\u2019re gonna start being pushed out of their lives!", "Are you that much of a snob or do you just not like your DIL?  YTA.", "YTA \n\n> I said that was childish and that I was hurt that she\u2019d be so upset over thinking she had a say in MY event. It all felt ridiculous. \n\nno ma\u2019am reading THIS felt ridiculous. it\u2019s not your event, it\u2019s your SON\u2019S BIRTHDAY what about that makes it yours? shouldn\u2019t what he want for his own birthday matter a bit more than what *you* want for *his* birthday? \n\n> I snapped and said that it\u2019s not her birthday and that she has no right to dictate what\u2019s served at my event. \n\nwell lmao it\u2019s not YOUR BIRTHDAY either, and she wasn\u2019t trying to dictate shit. she offered to bring things. she said she would *like* to bake her husband\u2019s birthday cake, that he also clearly wants her to bake and offered to have alongside yours as a *compromise* \n\nall you care about is how everything *looks* but not about what your son actually *wants* that\u2019s pretty clear. *he wants the cake made by his wife*", "YTA. Your son clearly prefers the messy cake baked by his wife to your \u201cnostalgic\u201d, pretty looking one. \n\nTime to let go, he\u2019s living in the present, not in the past (unlike you) - this is likely the last birthday you ever host for him, hope this was a worthwhile hill to die on", "YTA. \n\nFrom this post you come across as vain, superficial and controlling. Stop trying to exclude your DIL from her husband's birthday.", "Please, can someone illustrate a jealous cake shrew. The world needs this\n\nETA: OP YTA", "Gus ? Is that you?", "OP is so worried about aesthetics that she's willing to jeopardize her relationship with her son & DIL.", "#YTA.\n\nThis is how families end up in tatters.

If it wasn't for his birthday, Op wouldn't be throwing a party. If he backs out, then what? She throws a party without the birthday boy? Is not having an ugly cake on the table really that important in this instance?", "It's Greg's birthday.  So, by your logic, OP should have the party without the guest of honour.  Who is the one who said he wanted Lima to make his birthday cake. \nOP is an AH in this situation.", "This isn't a dinner party. It's his first birthday since getting married and he wants his wife to make the cake.", "At least you picked a good username for yourself, given that you're evidently willing to make someone else's birthday about what YOU want.\n\n\"Don't care how, I want it now!\"", "I\u2019m sorry, but wtf did I just read? Is this OPs alt account?", "Did you even bother reading?", "Well thought out answer that is still compassionate to the original poster. May actually get through to her.", "I\u2019m better OPs cake doesn\u2019t taste very good, even if it\u2019s \u2018prettier\u2019", "Absolutely. And they even said there could be two cakes, so Lima and Greg wouldn't be offended if OP makes another cake. So they can both make their cakes, there's more cake for everyone, Greg is happy, Lima is not disallowed for showing her husband she loves him and guests can choose to eat Lima's yummy cake of character or OPs pretentious cake of hatred.", "Also sounds like OP wants to stay the most important woman in her son's life.", "It\u2019s actually a great idea. OP can stop beating around the bush and make it crystal clear that having her own way is more important than honoring her son on his birthday.", "Yeah, OP show them who the boss is! Oh\u2026 wait, lol. It is amazing how she said she didn\u2019t tell her why because she didn\u2019t want to hurt her feelings  but still didn\u2019t allow her to participate.", "Yeah, it bothers me that her son and DIL offered up an amazing compromise and she still wouldn't accept it. I think she knows Lima's food is better than hers and doesn't want her cake there for comparison.", "But like.... food is not a competition. I never get this. Just add another cake and even if both are good, some people are gonna prefer OPs nostalgic marble cake with sprinkles and some will prefer Lima's creative green tea and orange cake and all your guests will be happy they'll be given the choice, most will likely try both because in my experience, people like cake.", "No, it's not a competition for most people. But I get the vibe that it is definitely a competition for OP."]}
