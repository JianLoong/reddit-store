It seems she is simply being dishonest about how she truly feels about your kid.\nIf that is true, then it's a serious issue that needs to be discussed, maybe even in therapy - because this can really really become a problem. So I wouldn't say banning conversation about your son is the solution; that's just sweeping the problem under the rug.\n\nEdit: The reason I'm not saying that everyone sucks is because, while I think banning conversation about your son is not the solution, it does emphasize that you really are not willing to make him a second-rank son; no compromises.

Not sure if you are home when the teenagers are there but if you are not, then you can't just decide her opinion doesn't matter. \n\nYour wife is an asshole because she can't just deny one child from having friends over. If their relationship is already not strong, this will definitely make it worse. I do disagree with you though comparing teenagers hanging out to play dates. Teenagers don't really need supervision compared to your kids who have play dates. Still though, I don't think it is fair to ban the teenagers friends from coming over. \n\nYou need to compromise. Choose a day or two that the teenagers can come over. Tell wife that she doesn't need to be home. I would have a spot for snacks that the teenagers can take.

I'm smiling because most of the parents of teenagers I know feel pretty much the same way . . . but they don't ban their slightly grating, raucous, exhausting kids from their homes because of it, because that's just life parenting teenagers.\n\nIf your wife didn't want to parent a teenager, or deal with the social life that comes with it, then she probably shouldn't have married someone who had three kids who were going to reach adolescence sooner rather than later. And she CERTAINLY shouldn't have had three MORE kids with you . . . because she's going to be doing this all over again with them, and I hope she realises that it's not going to be any different with the ones she gave birth to.\n\nIn fact, I'd say from the sound of it that she's a special brand of AH not only for being disinterested in your oldest, who is still her (step)child (and people can say what they want, but my sister's stepsons came into her life as difficult, neurodivergent preteens and she still absolutely welcomed them with great affection) . . . but for not recognising how LUCKY she is to have a teenaged stepson who sounds well-adjusted, friendly, popular, and like his friends are pretty decent as well. It could be SO MUCH WORSE. In a blended family y'all could be dealing with rebellion, rudeness, acting out . . . instead you have a gaggle of good natured kids who want to play games in your lounge? That's most parents' dream! \n\nYou are NTA, but I think it's time to sit down and have a serious talk with her once and for all about her attitude towards your child and how it differs from how she treats her bio kids.", "When your wife married you, she also married your family.

She sounds like she wants all your resources for her and her own children.\n\nEqual rules for all kids would be the only equitable decision.
