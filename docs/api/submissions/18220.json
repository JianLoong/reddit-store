If their relationship is already not strong, this will definitely make it worse. I do disagree with you though comparing teenagers hanging out to play dates. Teenagers don't really need supervision compared to your kids who have play dates. Still though, I don't think it is fair to ban the teenagers friends from coming over. \n\nYou need to compromise.

I'm smiling because most of the parents of teenagers I know feel pretty much the same way . . . but they don't ban their slightly grating, raucous, exhausting kids from their homes because of it, because that's just life parenting teenagers.\n\nIf your wife didn't want to parent a teenager, or deal with the social life that comes with it, then she probably shouldn't have married someone who had three kids who were going to reach adolescence sooner rather than later. And she CERTAINLY shouldn't have had three MORE kids with you . . . because she's going to be doing this all over again with them, and I hope she realises that it's not going to be any different with the ones she gave birth to.\n\nIn fact, I'd say from the sound of it that she's a special brand of AH not only for being disinterested in your oldest, who is still her (step)child (and people can say what they want, but my sister's stepsons came into her life as difficult, neurodivergent preteens and she still absolutely welcomed them with great affection) . . . but for not recognising how LUCKY she is to have a teenaged stepson who sounds well-adjusted, friendly, popular, and like his friends are pretty decent as well.

The son is 15 and based on the extracurricular activities that the dad knows about, he likely lives at least part time with dad.", "I'm not even saying that the wife is right in saying stepson \"CAN'T EVER HAVE FRIENDS OVER EVER\" (if that's even what she's saying). I'm saying that if there is a disagreement about any of the kids, it is flat-out unacceptable to ban any discussion about any kid. That literally makes no sense. Again, this is someone in the wife's home and is A PART OF HER FAMILY.\n\nThe correct response would be to try and better understand what exact problems the wife has and work to find a solution for everyone. Does the husband need to go to the grocery store more often, does teenager and friends need to go somewhere else more often?\n\nThe response to the situation should be to increase discussion not ban it.", "I read that answer. And the problem is in that answer. \n\nGreat that the kids clean after themselves, but they also take the food like they live there. That's the issue here. She doesn't want a bunch of people going throught her kitchen and take her food like it's their home. She wants boundaries. She wants to be asked before those kids come over. She wants to have a say about what's going on under her roof.\n\nOP just shutting down any conversation about it shows  that she probably never gets the basic respects of being told when the stepson invite  people over or how long they are staying.", ">they can makes sandwiches\n\nBut are they?", "Ok cool.

Her kids don't have anywhere to send them, zero point to complain about them.", "They don't feed themselves, they lurk in the fridge. And she says they are loud. They maybe aren't worse than other kids, but doesn't mean you have to take everything that isn't worse than what you already have.", "They don't feed themselves, they lurk in the fridge.

It's our house. We all live here.", "But why are they the only ones being forbidden to hang at the house??", "Yep. So why can't your wife express she needs boundaries about what's happening in her house ?", "Because they have elsewhere to go when toddlers are hey full responsibility. It's reasonable to try to minimise a load when you already have two very young kids.\n\nDo you expect her to forbid her own kids to come to their own home?", "Because they have elsewhere to go when toddlers are hey full responsibility.
