It seems she is simply being dishonest about how she truly feels about your kid.\nIf that is true, then it's a serious issue that needs to be discussed, maybe even in therapy - because this can really really become a problem. So I wouldn't say banning conversation about your son is the solution; that's just sweeping the problem under the rug.\n\nEdit: The reason I'm not saying that everyone sucks is because, while I think banning conversation about your son is not the solution, it does emphasize that you really are not willing to make him a second-rank son; no compromises.

Not sure if you are home when the teenagers are there but if you are not, then you can't just decide her opinion doesn't matter. \n\nYour wife is an asshole because she can't just deny one child from having friends over. If their relationship is already not strong, this will definitely make it worse. I do disagree with you though comparing teenagers hanging out to play dates. Teenagers don't really need supervision compared to your kids who have play dates. Still though, I don't think it is fair to ban the teenagers friends from coming over. \n\nYou need to compromise. Choose a day or two that the teenagers can come over. Tell wife that she doesn't need to be home. I would have a spot for snacks that the teenagers can take.

I'm smiling because most of the parents of teenagers I know feel pretty much the same way . . . but they don't ban their slightly grating, raucous, exhausting kids from their homes because of it, because that's just life parenting teenagers.\n\nIf your wife didn't want to parent a teenager, or deal with the social life that comes with it, then she probably shouldn't have married someone who had three kids who were going to reach adolescence sooner rather than later. And she CERTAINLY shouldn't have had three MORE kids with you . . . because she's going to be doing this all over again with them, and I hope she realises that it's not going to be any different with the ones she gave birth to.\n\nIn fact, I'd say from the sound of it that she's a special brand of AH not only for being disinterested in your oldest, who is still her (step)child (and people can say what they want, but my sister's stepsons came into her life as difficult, neurodivergent preteens and she still absolutely welcomed them with great affection) . . . but for not recognising how LUCKY she is to have a teenaged stepson who sounds well-adjusted, friendly, popular, and like his friends are pretty decent as well. It could be SO MUCH WORSE. In a blended family y'all could be dealing with rebellion, rudeness, acting out . . . instead you have a gaggle of good natured kids who want to play games in your lounge? That's most parents' dream! \n\nYou are NTA, but I think it's time to sit down and have a serious talk with her once and for all about her attitude towards your child and how it differs from how she treats her bio kids.", "When your wife married you, she also married your family.

She sounds like she wants all your resources for her and her own children.\n\nEqual rules for all kids would be the only equitable decision.

I have no reason not to believe they are well-behaved; I was part of a group of teenagers that were pretty well-behaved.  Our hijinks were a big yawn-fest as far as teenage rebellion goes. I know such groups exist LOL\n\nBut... even as a still-boring adult, I think it would be a lot for me after a while if my significant other had a group of friends over to the house every day, or even every other day.

You suspect, I think, that she can't explain it and that she's treating your son badly because he is your stepson.  I don't know her, and it is entirely possible this is a thing.\n\nI think it's more likely that she's feeling overwhelmed, though. My suspicion is that the difference between the teenager hangouts and the child playdates that she seems to have trouble articulating revolves around the frequency of the hangouts combined with the semi-unplanned nature of the hangouts.\n\nShe may just really want a little bit more control in having some guest-free time at the house.  Now she's hit her limit and is now flailing around with an overcorrection. For some folks, it's less about individual event noise levels and more about the total accumulation of social activities over a period of time (even just social activities happening in the background).

All the kids helped finish the walls, painted everything, including the concrete floor and everyone brought something to decorate it from a couple of couches and old chairs to art on the walls.  The parents stocked an old fridge and microwave.  All the kids regularly paid about $5 into a food fund.  If the food ran out they had to wait for the next grocery run so no one went crazy over the food. They even put in a toilet and sink in one corner to keep everyone out of the main house.", "You're being an asshole because you banned the topic of your son but she's not the asshole for banning his friend group (that seems to have done nothing wrong)?

It seems like they just want to argue about who is right rather than figure out compromises or solutions for everyone.", "[deleted]", "Exactly. This is a house full with 6 kids! I can imagine the wife is overhwelmed by just the kids in the family all on their own. But, the 15 year old's friends sound like they come over often (and like you said) whenever they want. That is not the same as planned playdates that I'm sure don't happen everyday. \n\nI have to wonder if OP is also at home when the wife has to constantly deal with a house full of kids plus their uninvited friends always popping over unannounced. I'd be pissed in the wife's home if I already had my hands full and then never got a moment to be \"off\" because one kid always has their friends popping over whenever.... \n\nI think the easiest solution is to communicate some boundaries of how freequently the 15 year old can entertain at the house. Maybe that's one or two days a week vs daily.", "She wasn't setting boundaries though, she was banning them from the house altogether.

The kids *are* different.

She should be forcing the 15 year old to come home straight from school and eat the same food as the 2 year old? How about a 7pm bedtime for the 15 year old? \n\nThen she\u2019d be treating them the same, right?", "Why didn\u2019t she ask for the hangouts to be limited to one a week and planned then rather than trying to ban it fully ?

The 7 year old makes it easier for them both, they both get some time to breathe and has their child someone to play with. The wife having friends over does nothing for him, she gets to mingle with her friends while he likely has to corral or at least help with that while the wife hangs out with her friends (also, it\u2019s been mentioned that the son can find different houses to hand with his friends, why can\u2019t the wife and her friends go to a different house and meet up there, why does it always have to be OP\u2019s house?) The teenagers allow his son to have a sense of friendship and have fun being active and doing enjoyable things.\n\nIt seems like since the only group that benefits them both is the 7 year olds friends coming over.  It that seems obtuse to ban everyone but them from coming over. Maybe, since it\u2019s been mentioned several times that the husband does do shopping, the teenagers clean up after themselves and prepare the food themselves (something I highly doubt the toddlers or 7 year olds do, probably making a huge mess). \n\nIt sounds like a good compromise is to either limit all groups coming over and make them less infrequent (since the wives main argument was that they eat too much food and are too noisy, something that would be reduced by all groups coming less frequently) or maybe they can both understand that while not all groups coming over benefit them all, it makes each other happy and for that reason they can deal with a bit of hardship.", "Assume much?", "OP says \"she's never had much interest in my oldest\" and he married her like that. He only *just* started protecting his child.", "She\u2019s deffo the asshole . She didn\u2019t even suggest planned vists and only once a week .

Playdates between younger kids are arranged, so Mom knows when they're going to happen, and can say no if there other activities she needs to attend to. OP does not seem to appreciate this difference. \n\nAt the very least, Teen should ASK IF he can bring friends over. It's everyone's house, not just the Teen's and not just the OP's.\n\nFWIW, I have a teenage son. And we have a pool, so they like coming over. His friends are LOUDER than any toddlers I've ever dealt with. The one rule we have is that he must ASK before he brings people over. It's a common f-ing courtesy that OP's Teen should extend. \n\nOP - YTA.", "This is the best complete answer. A pity it's so low. It's not outrageous to think that any child would have to ask before bringing friends over. Mom probably can't use whatever part of the house the teen and his friends are in at any given time.

Why? Because my parents didn't care what she did, and wouldn't bug her. She grew marijuana in her closet. Meanwhile, I was getting beaten up by my dad over leaving the bread out. Does that sound healthy to you?\n\nOtoh, my teenage son does not have his friends show up whenever. He asks if he can have people over. Sometimes we say yes, sometimes we say no.

The son really needs to get permission to have friends over or at least be required to give a certain amount of heads up.

I don\u2019t know how else to describe it. \n\nShe\u2019s got three little ones, who by your own description, are loud and cry a lot and have play dates.  Her brain and capacity to communicate may be hampered by sheer exhaustion over that right there.  And her tolerance may just also be exhausted. \n\nAnd it sounds like you\u2019ve had this conversation over and over and gotten nowhere with each other.

To me that would seem like a reasonable expectation.  \n\nI know today on Reddit it seems like there\u2019s a flood of people who feel near adult children should not have to get permission to have people over.  But as parent of a teenager myself who is friends with other parents, as a courtesy our teenagers do ask if it\u2019s okay before they host get togethers.  \n\nI gave my daughter permission to host and organize as many as she likes here this summer.  She just needs to let me know when so I can work my housekeeping schedule around these guests. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t mean to presume, so I have to keep an open mind on this, but a lot of stepparent relationships presented on this sub feature a step parent who is going to be held responsible for minors due to the law, but by the rules/dynamics of the relationship as set forth by the stepchildren or biological parents, aren\u2019t allowed to exert any kind of parental authority or have any kind of parental relationship with the step child or sometimes even speak unless spoken to by the step child.  \n\nSo I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the kind of situation your wife is dealing with or not, but if it is, I can\u2019t fault her for not feeling as inclined to give up her peace and quiet for someone who may very well just tolerate her presence in their shared home. \n\nI can\u2019t outright say YTA because there\u2019s something about the way you\u2019re presenting the situation to us that sounds like there\u2019s something missing.

I don\u2019t know.  \n\nI can say as a parent who used to host playdates for littles and now has opened my home to my daughter\u2019s considerate and lovely friends whom I adore, even under the easy ideal conditions I\u2019ve had dealing with an only child as she grows, it was still a huge adjustment for me to lose control of my privacy and peace and quiet in sharing a home with a near adult child.  \n\nNow she actually is an adult at 18.  Fortunately she\u2019s very considerate about making sure her dad and I have our necessary peace and quiet and we\u2019ve made spaces for her friends to hang out where they\u2019re not in our way nor are we in theirs.

And if you impose what they are going to see as arbitrary rules on them about not being able to have friends around, you\u2019re going to undermine your relationship with them at a time when they need to be closer to you than ever so you can give them guidance and help them navigate issues that might otherwise lead them down a bad path.

My grandparents attitude towards this led to them being people my friends could go to with personal problems when they didn\u2019t feel safe with their own parents. I think having that safe house can help teens develop safely and have a place to learn boundaries. It\u2019s important to note too that I am gay and my friends in my teens were too and a lot of them were actually out to my family before their own.

I guess I don't understand people who want kids (especially 6) and think their lives are going to be quiet and organized. Embrace the chaos that you helped build.

Family counseling helped us develop better ways of communicating and keeping a relationship as he became a teenager. \n\nI think it's pretty weird not to be involved in the life of a child you've known since they were 7.", "They can allow that and the kid can still ask permission. \n\nI grew up in the safe haven/fun house. My friends were over CONSTANTLY, year round but I *always* asked my mom if it was ok that they would come by. We also had enough common areas and places to be that we weren\u2019t bothering others. Basement, backyard, my bedroom, second family room\u2026 We never went in my siblings bedrooms or parents room and never hung out in the kitchen or main family room so we weren\u2019t annoying others. \n\nIt\u2019s really not unreasonable for the teen to just give notice/ask permission. Maybe wife would be more flexible if she had time to mentally prep herself.", "That's my place. All of the kids come here. Some have hard home lives so this is the only place they get anything cooked for them, let alone homemade!", "This. It totally sound like she can handle the younger ones but the oldest is treated differently. I would not abide by this myself so, you need to come to a decision that everyone can live with. When she married you, she married your spawn. That was as good as a promise that she will treat everyone equally, within reason. At the same time, if she doesn\u2019t have experience with teens and your son or his friends are being disrespectful in any way, shape or form, towards her, you need to have a talk with your teen as well as your current wife. \n\nIf she is only complaining about food costs then, you might need to allow for more In the food budget for extra teens.", "That and this is what cinched it for me.\n\n\"I asked if this is going to be the rule for all the kids,\" and  \"She says those are different.\"\n\nYeah, we know why she views him as different.\n\nI call bs on she's just not comfortable with his age group or not being checked in with. She's not comfortable because to her, his oldest son isn't her family. What she said tells it all right there.", "Okay? But they\u2019re all his kids and therefore share a common home. when the oldest of their shared children is 15 will he not be allowed in the home either? Not allowed to have friends over? Be for real. The issue is she doesn\u2019t see this child as part of the family and that is disgusting behavior.", "That is very reasonable but if the wife was being reasonable she wouldn't bring up \"they should go to his mother's house\". That's the argumentative ventilation that comes from frustration", "I\u2019m so glad you were there for those kids\u2026especially the one who needed a place to live.", "You sound like an awesome mom!", "Yes. In the summer (before cell phones) I would just show up at my friends house, knock on the door, and we would go do something. We would run in and out if my grandmas house as it was closer to the center of town. My younger cousin did the same with his friends. We could get snacks but not really meals. \n\nOther friends I did need to make arrangements with. But part of that was transportation. It depends on the people involved and then parents. And all of the kids relationships with each other and the adults.", "What about his child\u2019s comfort in their own home? That is that kids home too. Don\u2019t ever be a step parent if you have that attitude. Gross", "Y'know what's funny? That second sentence, that's word for word what my ex said when she asked for a divorce. Huh, maybe something to think about.", "She did it to herself?! How did she get herself pregnant?!", "I rotated between three houses, and at all of them my friends were welcome. More and more as I got older. I\u2019m baffled this person has so many kids if they don\u2019t want kids around.", "Without any notice AND without any expectation of when they\u2019ll leave.", "100%. We plan out our meals so grabbing that food is an issue. \n\nAnd I doubt the teenagers are grabbing the unpeeled and I chopped carrots, for example, rather than the chopped and peeled ones for dinner the next day.", "Agreed\nThis man is nuts", "That's the entire point.  OP's wife hasn't articulated what she finds so problematic about them being there, just that they're there.  If she doesn't have a specific complaint and refuses to back down despite having no valid reason for her griping the only solution left is to shut the discussion down.", "Wife didn\u2019t offer asking for permission she banned them.", "There is a happy medium between no friends and friends who can come over whenever with no heads up or checking in from a parent. My guess is she wanted the \u201ccheck in\u201d but that didn\u2019t happen, so this is the result of being uncomfortable in her home for a while.", "Chose to have sex with a man with the intent to get pregnant.  That dance takes two, but the pair of them consented to it first.", "Imagine having to worry about the group of teenagers off in public together, doing as they please because they aren\u2019t in a home with rules and expectations. I personally would much prefer for my teen to be at home, where I know they are safe. \n\nEveryone\u2019s still TA here, just something to think about.", "That\u2019s great that your parents did this and it worked for you. I don\u2019t think it would work for me. And I really doubt it works for all parents. \n\nI\u2019m an introvert and am a shitty house cleaner. The situation you\u2019re describing fills me with dread and anxiety. My kids and 12 and 9 so I\u2019m not there yet and maybe I\u2019ll feel differently when they\u2019re older, but as much as I love my children, I would NOT look forward to gaggles of teenagers coming in and out of my house all the time.", "\ud83d\udcaf. OP, it\u2019s great that you\u2019re willing to host the teens; personally I\u2019d much rather have teens hanging out at my home playing board games and swimming where I can keep an eye on them rather than off doing hoodlum shit. But there needs to be a balance. If your wife is an introvert & even if she\u2019s not, it can be mentally exhausting dealing with normal life stuff and on top of that to be surprised with a ravenous gang of noisy teens. Not to mention expensive if you\u2019re having to feed them all the time. Since it\u2019s summer, maybe designate one weekday to have friends over + the weekend, or whatever you can work out w your wife.", "Well, at this point, yeah. She\u2019s at her breaking point and probably just wants a break from the constant visits for now. They\u2019ve worn out their welcome with her. \n\nSo perhaps a solution for now is to either set some \u201cvisiting hours\u201d in which son must run it by parents first, but unless there is a good reason to decline, will be approved. \n\nThen when it feels more under control, wife is less overwhelmed with the constant visits, and son has gotten into the habit of asking first, they could maybe shift away from \u201cvisiting hours\u201d and just an \u201cask the homeowners first\u201d policy.", "You are **absolutely right** with the thought process that having children/teens in the home, safe, with full knowledge of their location and activity, is hugely important.\n\nThat said, giving a teenager blanket permission to have as many friends over as he likes, as often as he likes, for as long as he likes,  is definitely not ok.  Nobody sharing a home with others (not roommates, not family, nobody) should have that kind of license to disregard others living there. \n\nIf OP feels that his wife has discriminatory issues with his adopted son, this (allowing the behavior and refusing to discuss it further) is not the way to handle them.  He needs to address what he perceives as the actual problem, instead of obfuscating the issue and then hiding from it.", "Which means your wife gets a say too. And your son needs to be considerate of the other people who live there.", "And yet you have banned your wife from talking about people that you have given carte blanche to be there whenever they want. That\u2019s you acting like you and only you are in charge of the house.\n\nThis is your wife\u2019s home, the only home she has. Banning her from talking about people that you allow into her home \u2014 whenever they want \u2014 is terrible. And while her attitude to your son is questionable, that act of yours makes YTA.", "She\u2019s probably fed up since it doesn\u2019t sound like OO is a reasonable guy. Im not saying she is more right than he is in this case, but she\u2019s not wrong for wanting some kind of boundaries here. The ban is too far but ffs, she\u2019s allowed to want limitations on how often a bunch of teens are at her home.", "Yes all the time. My daughter has friends who come over and she even takes food to school for kids who admit to her the only meal they get a day is lunch. The world is ugly and I have every intention of doing what OP is doing which is providing a safe haven from that ugly for my kid and any friends she wants to have over. Read all the comments from OP he goes shopping all the time and takes the kids with him. He's doing the right thing by not letting her start alienating his older kids and banning their friends is step one in that process.", "My house was the same. Difference is I HATED it. My siblings always had all their friends in and out and it was never ever quiet. Not even for a moment. I despised it. My mum thought it was fine, because it was how she was raised, so my begging for quiet was treated as a joke. People are different. They have different needs for privacy and quiet and predictability. \n\nBanning the kids isn\u2019t reasonable, but OP saying this is how it is and there will be no discussion could easily lead to estrangement if she honestly can\u2019t handle the current situation. \n\nESH (except the kids, they\u2019re innocent bystanders)", "Kinda sounds like it. When asked if the other kids are going to have the same rule she said its different.", "We have a bunch of kids in our neighborhood and they all come and go. Just knock on the door, if we're home, cool! They're outside a lot or in the basement or kids' rooms playing video games. What's the big deal? I'm so glad my kids have friends. They've all developed social anxiety during covid and I'm just glad they're finally readjusting.", "Then why did she have three children with someone who already had three children? Having a bunch of kids and teens in the house was part of the deal.", "Probably have more boundaries than OP is willing to set. I cannot imagine being cool with my kids having their friends over all the time with no notice and no expectation of when they\u2019ll be leaving. I love my kids and would want them to feel comfortable having their friends over but with some notice and with boundaries and not 6 days out of 7. \n\nI\u2019m an introvert who sucks at cleaning. Everything about this situation gives me loads of anxiety.", "Not for the summertime. Kids want to be with their friends. If OP allows the wife to make his son feel unwelcome it will affect the other two from his first marriage and they will all disappear when they can. It's not like they're being disrespectful or trashing the house. They're playing board games.", "Then she can ask for that not just ban him from having friends over.", "I thought he meant same rules now in the present day, because he went on and on about how her kids are louder now in the present. And it's different because her kid is seven.", "I mean presumably by the time the 2 year old is a teenager, the mom won't have to be focused on a 2 year old if/when he has friends over.\n\nTwo year olds are awesome but exhausting. When you have one, it is reasonable that you want the rest of the house to be predictable and organized, just for your sanity. Teenagers are lots of things, but one of them is not predictable.\n\nIt is admirable that OP is so concerned with making things \"even\" and \"fair,\" but frankly lots of times life isn't even and fair. If your wife is struggling cuz you created a kid with her and are leaving her alone with that kid and also allowing your teenager to bring any number of Teenagers into the house at any time for any reason, surprise, she get overwhelmed and everyone will struggle.", "That\u2019s you. \n\nI had tons of friends as a kid and a great community. I grew up in a VERY social and busy family/household. Of my siblings, I easily had my friends over the most frequently and even though it was almost always a \u201cyes\u201d, I ALWAYS asked. \u201cHey mom, is it cool if so and so comes by to xyz?\u201d Easy. Respectful. \n\nMy parents always expected that we ask for permission before friends came over/into the house. And they loved our friends and being the \u201cfun\u201d house. Hell, even if I wanted to dip out and ride bikes around the neighborhood I had to give courtesy and ask permission. As I got older 15+, \u201cpermission\u201d changed and it was more of just letting my parent know where I was going/what I was doing bur the \u201copen door\u201d policy is not a one size fits all method for all families. \n\nOP\u2019s wife is NOT unreasonable for wanting notice before a bunch of teens rock up into her home.", "Except she clearly didn\u2019t. She tried to have conversation with her husband about it AGAIN and he completely shut it down. It\u2019s also incredibly clear that he\u2019s not willing to let his wife have any boundaries to having the teenagers friends over so clearly the conversations she\u2019s been trying have have fallen on deaf ears.", "Yes it is. Teens have other places to hang out than at one member of the groups house. Its her home, she has a right to be comfortable in it. OP is not respecting his wife and its not wonder he's divorced.", "I agree, it sounds like they all just need to talk about what's actually bothering them and not try to go around making rules with no explanation given", "You are a wonderful person, and I wish you could see the positive ripple effects your actions are having/will have for years to come.\n\nYou are right that banning the teens is ridiculous.\n\nRefusing to discuss it further is ridiculous, also.\n\nWith six children as the starting number, some compromise is in order for the household.  Otherwise, just setting the base at three days/week, and allowing for only four of the six to have company on a given day, they would easily wind up with (four children having guests, with only three friends each coming over) 18 kids in the home on any given day.  \n\nIt is understandable if the wife wants some voice with that.", "It's possible she's talking about a ban because she's so stressed. I know some people who become a bit melodramatic and declare extreme options like 'it's so messy, we should just throw everything in a skip' when really stressed. Since he refuses to discuss, maybe she did have more reasonable suggestions before."]}
