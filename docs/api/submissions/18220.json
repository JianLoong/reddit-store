It seems she is simply being dishonest about how she truly feels about your kid.\nIf that is true, then it's a serious issue that needs to be discussed, maybe even in therapy - because this can really really become a problem. So I wouldn't say banning conversation about your son is the solution; that's just sweeping the problem under the rug.\n\nEdit: The reason I'm not saying that everyone sucks is because, while I think banning conversation about your son is not the solution, it does emphasize that you really are not willing to make him a second-rank son; no compromises.

Not sure if you are home when the teenagers are there but if you are not, then you can't just decide her opinion doesn't matter. \n\nYour wife is an asshole because she can't just deny one child from having friends over. If their relationship is already not strong, this will definitely make it worse. I do disagree with you though comparing teenagers hanging out to play dates. Teenagers don't really need supervision compared to your kids who have play dates. Still though, I don't think it is fair to ban the teenagers friends from coming over. \n\nYou need to compromise. Choose a day or two that the teenagers can come over. Tell wife that she doesn't need to be home. I would have a spot for snacks that the teenagers can take.

I'm smiling because most of the parents of teenagers I know feel pretty much the same way . . . but they don't ban their slightly grating, raucous, exhausting kids from their homes because of it, because that's just life parenting teenagers.\n\nIf your wife didn't want to parent a teenager, or deal with the social life that comes with it, then she probably shouldn't have married someone who had three kids who were going to reach adolescence sooner rather than later. And she CERTAINLY shouldn't have had three MORE kids with you . . . because she's going to be doing this all over again with them, and I hope she realises that it's not going to be any different with the ones she gave birth to.\n\nIn fact, I'd say from the sound of it that she's a special brand of AH not only for being disinterested in your oldest, who is still her (step)child (and people can say what they want, but my sister's stepsons came into her life as difficult, neurodivergent preteens and she still absolutely welcomed them with great affection) . . . but for not recognising how LUCKY she is to have a teenaged stepson who sounds well-adjusted, friendly, popular, and like his friends are pretty decent as well. It could be SO MUCH WORSE. In a blended family y'all could be dealing with rebellion, rudeness, acting out . . . instead you have a gaggle of good natured kids who want to play games in your lounge? That's most parents' dream! \n\nYou are NTA, but I think it's time to sit down and have a serious talk with her once and for all about her attitude towards your child and how it differs from how she treats her bio kids.", "When your wife married you, she also married your family.

She sounds like she wants all your resources for her and her own children.\n\nEqual rules for all kids would be the only equitable decision.

I have no reason not to believe they are well-behaved; I was part of a group of teenagers that were pretty well-behaved.  Our hijinks were a big yawn-fest as far as teenage rebellion goes. I know such groups exist LOL\n\nBut... even as a still-boring adult, I think it would be a lot for me after a while if my significant other had a group of friends over to the house every day, or even every other day.

You suspect, I think, that she can't explain it and that she's treating your son badly because he is your stepson.  I don't know her, and it is entirely possible this is a thing.\n\nI think it's more likely that she's feeling overwhelmed, though. My suspicion is that the difference between the teenager hangouts and the child playdates that she seems to have trouble articulating revolves around the frequency of the hangouts combined with the semi-unplanned nature of the hangouts.\n\nShe may just really want a little bit more control in having some guest-free time at the house.  Now she's hit her limit and is now flailing around with an overcorrection. For some folks, it's less about individual event noise levels and more about the total accumulation of social activities over a period of time (even just social activities happening in the background).

All the kids helped finish the walls, painted everything, including the concrete floor and everyone brought something to decorate it from a couple of couches and old chairs to art on the walls.  The parents stocked an old fridge and microwave.  All the kids regularly paid about $5 into a food fund.  If the food ran out they had to wait for the next grocery run so no one went crazy over the food. They even put in a toilet and sink in one corner to keep everyone out of the main house.", "You're being an asshole because you banned the topic of your son but she's not the asshole for banning his friend group (that seems to have done nothing wrong)?

Yes.\n\nBut no asking, no schedule, no set times?\n\nThat would drive me insane and I would put a stop to it", "so normal tho! this is how it is with teens.  u should be able to be at your home with your friends.  poor kid.  wife is out of line.", "lol yeah that's a huge issue.

It seems like they just want to argue about who is right rather than figure out compromises or solutions for everyone.", "[deleted]", "Exactly. This is a house full with 6 kids! I can imagine the wife is overhwelmed by just the kids in the family all on their own. But, the 15 year old's friends sound like they come over often (and like you said) whenever they want. That is not the same as planned playdates that I'm sure don't happen everyday. \n\nI have to wonder if OP is also at home when the wife has to constantly deal with a house full of kids plus their uninvited friends always popping over unannounced. I'd be pissed in the wife's home if I already had my hands full and then never got a moment to be \"off\" because one kid always has their friends popping over whenever.... \n\nI think the easiest solution is to communicate some boundaries of how freequently the 15 year old can entertain at the house. Maybe that's one or two days a week vs daily.", "She wasn't setting boundaries though, she was banning them from the house altogether.

No compromise or anything just all hangouts .", "Agree with this, and also OP does not have the right to dictate the rules of the house based solely on his whims either.", ">She's wrong for treating the kids differently.\n\nI don't think that's true. The kids *are* different. It's a teenager vs a little kid, and a teenager bringing a group of friends over is different from a playdate for little kids.\n\nI don't think it's that unreasonable for the mom to feel like \"we have 6 kids already, I don't also want our house to be the main teen hang out spot.\" \n\nAnd we should all keep in mind we are judging whether OP is an asshole for banning conversation about it, not whether the teen friends are disruptive to their lives.\n\nI think it's a YTA because the idea of banning the conversation is completely ridiculous.", "So she should be scheduling playdates for the 15 year old? She should be forcing the 15 year old to come home straight from school and eat the same food as the 2 year old? How about a 7pm bedtime for the 15 year old? \n\nThen she\u2019d be treating them the same, right?", "Why didn\u2019t she ask for the hangouts to be limited to one a week and planned then rather than trying to ban it fully ? She\u2019s not trying to compromise", "Now let\u2019s view it from the husbands lens. The 7 year old makes it easier for them both, they both get some time to breathe and has their child someone to play with. The wife having friends over does nothing for him, she gets to mingle with her friends while he likely has to corral or at least help with that while the wife hangs out with her friends (also, it\u2019s been mentioned that the son can find different houses to hand with his friends, why can\u2019t the wife and her friends go to a different house and meet up there, why does it always have to be OP\u2019s house?) The teenagers allow his son to have a sense of friendship and have fun being active and doing enjoyable things.\n\nIt seems like since the only group that benefits them both is the 7 year olds friends coming over.  It that seems obtuse to ban everyone but them from coming over. Maybe, since it\u2019s been mentioned several times that the husband does do shopping, the teenagers clean up after themselves and prepare the food themselves (something I highly doubt the toddlers or 7 year olds do, probably making a huge mess). \n\nIt sounds like a good compromise is to either limit all groups coming over and make them less infrequent (since the wives main argument was that they eat too much food and are too noisy, something that would be reduced by all groups coming less frequently) or maybe they can both understand that while not all groups coming over benefit them all, it makes each other happy and for that reason they can deal with a bit of hardship.", "Assume much?", "OP says \"she's never had much interest in my oldest\" and he married her like that. He only *just* started protecting his child.", "She\u2019s deffo the asshole . She didn\u2019t even suggest planned vists and only once a week .

Playdates between younger kids are arranged, so Mom knows when they're going to happen, and can say no if there other activities she needs to attend to. OP does not seem to appreciate this difference. \n\nAt the very least, Teen should ASK IF he can bring friends over. It's everyone's house, not just the Teen's and not just the OP's.\n\nFWIW, I have a teenage son. And we have a pool, so they like coming over. His friends are LOUDER than any toddlers I've ever dealt with. The one rule we have is that he must ASK before he brings people over. It's a common f-ing courtesy that OP's Teen should extend. \n\nOP - YTA.", "This is the best complete answer. A pity it's so low. It's not outrageous to think that any child would have to ask before bringing friends over. Mom probably can't use whatever part of the house the teen and his friends are in at any given time.

Running out of food is a problem, even if it can be picked up later.", "I know that it's not everyone's cup of tea, but for me having a house full of laughing kids just being kids and having snacks and playing games is a pretty fun time.", "> As to have teens randomly show up at your house- that is 100% normal in very healthy families. \n\nYeah, no, no it's not.\n\nMy sister's friends would show up at our house unannounced. Why? Because my parents didn't care what she did, and wouldn't bug her. She grew marijuana in her closet. Meanwhile, I was getting beaten up by my dad over leaving the bread out. Does that sound healthy to you?\n\nOtoh, my teenage son does not have his friends show up whenever. He asks if he can have people over. Sometimes we say yes, sometimes we say no. No one is getting beaten. No one is growing weed.

The son really needs to get permission to have friends over or at least be required to give a certain amount of heads up.

With 6 kids in your family, I can see your wife looking at her future and not wanting to be swarmed by unannounced gangs of roving teenagers for another 15 years (which will be particularly annoying for her when you\u2019ve got overlapping hordes of 18, 15 and 13-year olds (or whatever the age breakdown would be), all raiding your fridge)\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly important that your kids know that this is their home and that they are always welcome.

What about the fact her stepson has friends. That he not going out causing trouble. Thats not a benefit for her?", "NTA she is just trying to alienate your son. Do not let her.", "THANK YOU! I'm the mom of a teen. I love my kid, but he's not allowed to have friends over whenever he feels like it. We all share this space, and we have to be courteous to one another.", "This is not a hard and fast rule. Many families have open door policies. The problem isn\u2019t open door or not open door, it\u2019s that the parents have different expectations for family life regarding the rules.", "It sounds like if the kid asks OP's wife, she is always going to say no.", "You guys aren\u2019t very hospitable at all . She should have suggested some boundaries rather than trying to ban it all together. \n\nI would never agree to this if I was op she\u2019s overstepping the mark big time", "I think it's the wife too!", "So? I don\u2019t understand what your statement is trying to prove? You can have teenagers and not want their friends to come over constantly for 5+ hours", "What are you even replying to my guy", "This is reddit, where women do everything both physically and mentally, and the men sit in their dens, drinking beer playing video games", "He said they are only there 3 or 4 days a week and never after 6 unless invited. It's summertime and kids want to hangout with their friends. His kid has every right to be in his home with friends as much as any of the other kids. I'd take teenagers anyway over screaming toddlers their parent with them or not.", "Did you read my comment at all, or nah? I said they need to find a compromise. Probably him asking *permission* and there being a limit on how often the friends come over, but OP has expressed zero willingness to compromise in any way.", "It's also your wife's house.", "Yeah - they're existing in HER house, without any warning, at just about any time. They all have to share the house, but OP doesn't seem to understand the problem with having a gaggle of teens whenever his son feels like it.", "They do not need to hang out at your house what sounds like daily without notice, with no plan for when they're leaving, and while eating all of your food. Your son needs boundaries, and you're refusing to parent him.", "But the point is, they are not \"on top\". They have as much rights to live their live in an age appropriate way as their younger siblings have.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm totally against ultimatums, but I think when you marry a man with kids you should know what you are doing, and not act as if you can Substitute them with new kids, and the one from the first marriage have to go elsewhere.", "Except what is she going to do when her kids become teenagers? Not allow them to have friends over? They were allowed when they were younger, but now that they're teenagers they can't? Nah. Wife can deal.", "I'm very obviously replying to the person who can't comprehend that the wife doesn't do all the grocery shopping and meal planning.", "\u201cShe said that it\u2019s loud. They\u2019re loud and they\u2019re taking up space in the house. Just because you don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good reason doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a real one.\u201d\n\n\nLiterally no where does it speak of compromise in your comment lmao", "Also the sons house.", "The clubhouse is in their community. They come to the house because that\u2019s where they are if she doesn\u2019t want them in the house they aren\u2019t going to go to the clubhouse because they aren\u2019t welcome in the house.", "Also, the food issue would bother me because I'm a planner. If I am planning to roast the baby carrots in the fridge for dinner, I expect them to be there when I go to make dinner. It sounds like the teens are eating whatever they want, and OP's response is \"we can get the kids and go shopping.\" That would annoy the hell out of me honestly. I forgot to order dishwasher tabs and am currently annoyed at myself because I have to make an extra trip for that. Needing to make extra trips all the time or change my meal plans/snacks for toddlers because teens are over all of the time eating everything would be awful.", "Then why doesn\u2019t she argue for planned vists and limited to one a week ? She went overboard asking to ban it completely. \n\nWhy do the other kids get to have kids over but she wants him to be banned completely from it ?", "It\u2019s not just HER house it\u2019s THEIR house including the kids. OP says it\u2019s maybe 3 days a week, rarely later than 6pm. They aren\u2019t even in the house the whole time. And by your wording I understand why you side with her. You and her don\u2019t see the kid as part of her family.", "But they have to be somewhere. And if every parent had this attitude, then teens would be nowhere good.", "That\u2019s the thing - this son is at home. If he\u2019s a minor, his fathers home is his home. Acting like it\u2019s not his home because he has a mom with another house somewhere is some kind of evil step mother stuff.", "I just think it\u2019s disrespectful to bring a bunch of people over whenever you want without letting people know first. \n\nThat would drive me crazy, too.", "Ah, so you literally didn\u2019t. You just jumped in on the middle of the thread without reading my [actual comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13sfit3/aita_because_i_banned_all_further_conversations/jlpk5mf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3)", "But the solution to that is banning the children? Or is it finding a food/snack compromise? OP says he does the shopping and meal planning. Why is the solution not designated teen food/snacks instead of get these kids out of MY house. My issue here is the double standard that  she admits that her kids are different and these rules likely won\u2019t apply to them when they get to be teens. It\u2019s the kids house too and it\u2019s the dads house too. From context it comes down to she doesn\u2019t like the kid and does not view him as her family.", "Because by all the wording I believe she does not view him as a part of her family, merely and additional child that came with her husband.", "Almost like there\u2019s a middle ground between \u2018they can never ever come over\u2019 and \u2018there are absolutely no limits on how often they can come over\u2019.", "Your comment doesn\u2019t change the fact that the dad isn\u2019t the ah in this case.  The stepmom is for banning the teen from having get togethers at all.", "Literally every reply in this thread is a comment, you don\u2019t get to be pedantic when you\u2019re as clear as mud with what you\u2019re talking about. Do you expect people to look through your post history to piece together your intentions?", "Agreed. I also think she said \u201cthose are different\u201d about the 7 year old and the toddler not because of a \u201cyour kids vs our kids\u201d issue, but because the younger ones can\u2019t just come and go as they please. The adults are the ones planning *when* those happen and for how long (vs teenagers just deciding on a whim they\u2019re coming over etc)", "let me rephrase for you...\"since OP refuses to capitulate and prevent his son from having friends over, she decided that she was done and banned them herself\"", "You\u2019re making assumptions to justify her being an asshole trying to ban the teenagers from the house. If you don\u2019t see an issue with what she\u2019s done, then there\u2019s also no issue with OP\u2019s boundary on banning her mother and toddler friends and younger child\u2019s friends.", "I think \"reasonable behavior\" is 80% just social norms. I don't think it's reasonable to be offended by, oh let's say, like, one of the two year olds poked him. Well, he's two. You kind of have to take it on the chin."]}
