I\u2019m a paramedic and I was called to an apartment for a man saying he had chest pain.

But he is ill, in pain, physio hurts and like him, your Dad is likely scared. It is easier to do nothing.\n\nYour mother is asking more for reassurance and added ammo to deal with situation on ground. An immobile patient is a nightmare. Opting out is understandable and easy. But it will wreck your relationships forever.", "At the moment, YTA. Your father has a serious medical issue and you're refusing to provide additional assistance as you're not happy with his unwillingness to follow your advice. You're throwing a tantrum, taking your ball, and refusing to play. Your mother is clearly concerned about your fathers help and asking her knowledgable daughter for assistance. You have access to this knowledge because your father, who now requires your help, supported you financially. \n\nJudging by your explanation of your parents health issues, it's realistic to believe your remaining time with them is dwindling. Damaging your relationship with your parents over this is juvenile.\n\nJust give minimal advice and get on with your life. Refusing to assist and taking a \"I don't care about your health\" approach is immature and disrespectful. For this reason, YTA.", "YTA, that generation is like that as a whole. Especially the men, it\u2019s not a your dad thing it\u2019s being cognizant of how your parents were raised. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to care for him or keep giving advice if he won\u2019t listen, but telling your mom you don\u2019t care about your sick dad is mean and asshole behavior.\n\nBefore the AITA teenagers jump on me about what she is or isn\u2019t obligated to do, this sub is about if you are an asshole, and the way you say things matters in communication.
