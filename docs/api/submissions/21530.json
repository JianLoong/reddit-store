Do your kids like spending time with their cousins?\n\nMy sister and I dreaded spending time with just our grandparents, and waited eagerly for our aunts to drop our cousin's off.\n\nSo I'm just wondering if only you and your wife are bothered, or if your kids are too.", "YTA. \n\nYou live 8 hours away from your parents, your sister, and your niblings. When you are in town, it is understandable that everyone would want to spend time with you and your family.\n\nRelationships between cousins are important, too. Why do you see the presence of your niblings as taking something from you and your children?\n\nThey aren't stealing grandparent time away from your children. They are just bringing the added bonus of cousin time.\n\nYour entire mindset is baffling to me.", "YTA.  \n\n I lived 10 hours from grandparents. \nMy 6 cousins  lived on the same property  in another house.  \nI still helped my grandmother and would  talk while she was in the kitchen.\nIt never occurred  to me that I was missing out because I had cousins to play with and grandparents to go to store with", "YTA\nYou mentioned in the comments that you haven\u2019t had a serious conversation regarding your concerns. Your irritation isn\u2019t based on your kids\u2019 feedback. You state your dad \u201ccan\u2019t hear shit\u201d and the kids probably enjoy cousin time. You also said that you want your kids to have grandparent one on one time because you lost all of yours by age 5. This is a you problem. Also the resentment you have for your sister and her kids is a bit much. It\u2019s noone\u2019s fault they have more access. You moved for work and while that sucks it\u2019s still a choice you made. \n\nJust talk to your kids and parents in a productive manner. See how everyone else feels.", "Uh I feel like this is missing info, how are your parents at fault? Your sister is the one dropping her kids off. Your parents haven\u2019t done anything against you, they\u2019re just spending time with all their grandkids, which they are entitled to do.", "Who says their grandparent time is ruined- you or your kids?\nIf the kids don\u2019t care what\u2019s the actual issue?", "YTA, and I want you to take this seriously: both me and my older sibling loved it when our cousins came to Grandma's the same time we were there. It was a disappointment when they couldn't come. Foster a love with their cousins as well as with their grandparents. My cousins feel like sisters now, from how close we felt.", "YTA It sounds like your parents are generous and loving. You on the other hand seem demanding and unreasonable. You get to decide how to be a parent and your parents get to decide how to grandparent. You and your wife need to grow up.", "YTA. You chose to live that far from your family. If your parents don't have a problem with it, then neither should you. Do your kids enjoy spending time with their cousins. I bet they're better entertained by their cousins than they are by their grandparents.", "People's lives don't stop because you deigned to gift them with your presence. YTA", "I think you've got the answer from the very many people who've already responded. I just want to ask one thing: where exactly is the interpersonal conflict we are supposed to be judging? The only conflict I see here at all is between you and your wife. No one else in this situation is even aware that there's a problem.\n\nThis hardly qualifies for AITA in its current form. Step up and have the discussion with your parents (and your sister if relevant) and stop making a big deal out of something that the people involved have not expressed any problems with.", "YTA.  You don't get to dictate to other people how to conduct their relationships.  You're acting like someone is preventing your children from seeing their grandparents.  They're not.  You sound like a spoiled brat who never learned how to share.  If you have a problem with your sister, hash it out with her, and quit expecting your parents to get in the middle of your petty bullshit.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\", my sister dumps her kids at my parents house to \u201chang with their cousins\u201d. My parents allow it but it infuriates my wife and I because their grandparent time is ruined.\" .. your statement is ridiculous. They are having a great grandparent time with THEIR grandkids. All of them.", "YTA in assuming that the one on one regular time your nieces and nephews receive is of greater value than any time your kids are with their grandparents. Further, it is not your parent\u2019s nor your sister\u2019s fault that you live so far away. You are making a really big deal out of something that thousands of families deal with often and doesn\u2019t truly affect your kids negatively. They are also getting cousin time which is awesome for them and likely even more fun", "Why are you getting mad at your parents when it\u2019s your sister leaving the kids?", "YTA - Your parents are doing what all grandparents do, spending time with their grandchildren. \n\nThey don\u2019t see any of their grandchildren as an inconvenient like you do. They spend time with their grandchildren, which is something that should be treasured not hogged over on. \n\nWhy you choose to be bitter that your kids have a good relationship with their cousins and grandparents is beyond me.", "I just can't understand how you would feel this way. Family is so important and nowadays it seems like Harley families get together and do things anymore cuz everybody's either so busy or because there's some issue between family members. Growing up, my parents made sure I had time with my grandparents along with my sister but a lot of the time we were also in the same place with my aunt and uncle and their boys who are our cousins. We didn't care. We had time with our cousin switch was clearly to us girls at the time of being children more important than anything cuz we had someone else to play with. But we also had that time with our grandparents and our grandparents made time for us on spring break week. And even if you send the kids to spend the week with their grandparents and the cousins are over it's more fun for not only the kids but for the grandparents.", "YTA\n\nIf your children enjoy it, then stop trying to make them have some kind of memories they don't even want.", "YTA. It's clearly not about your kids. It's about you and what you think they're missing out on. My sibling sounds a lot like you and tried to dictate how much time each grandkid got with our mom. They didn't realize the only reason their kid wanted to go over to our mom's house was to play with their cousins. My mom would call me asking to bring my kid over because my niece was asking for her. And same thing with my ex mil. My kid goes over to \"see granny\" but it's actually to play with the cousins.", "My family situation is similar. I live locally to my parents and one of my siblings. When my other sibling and their family comes to town to visit my parents, my local sibling and I bring our families to our parent\u2019s too. We all recognize they\u2019re not visiting just to see our parents, they\u2019re visiting us all too. There\u2019s a bunch of grandkids between us and so the out of town grandkids don\u2019t get much one on one grandparent time. What my out of town sibling does is invite my parents on vacation with them. It gives them that quality individual time they don\u2019t necessarily get when they come visit us all.\n\nYTA - if you want one on one time, invite the parents to visit you or go on vacation with them", "Nobody is the AH. I get wanting quality grandparent time, but as the grandparent I can tell you my grandkids adore \u201ccousin time\u201d. Given the choice, they\u2019d pick cousins over us any day of the week. And honestly, I am okay with that. Hopefully they will be there for each other after we are all long gone.", "Just my take but YTA, it\u2019s important for your extended family to spend time with you and your family with what little time everyone is available.\n\nI agree with others that your children should also spend as much time with cousins, grandparents, aunts and uncles as they can.  Having parents willing to take on a bunch of small children at once is a blessing you should be thankful for and not complaining about.", "NTA- I\u2019ll take the downvotes too.  I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019d have the conversation with my parents.  Maybe suggest scheduled time with everyone and some opportunities with boat your kids and your family .", "YTA Why can't your kids ALSO spend time with their cousins which are kids like them? Tbh when I was a kid I preferred to play around with my cousins that spend time with my grandparents. Also you have never mention how your kids feel about it, and thats all that really matters, if they want alone time with grandparents or if they want their cousins around... In such scenario I don't think that what the parents want is really relevant", "I\u2019ll take the downvotes. NTA. Your sister\u2019s kids live 5 minutes from grandma and grandpa and probably visit frequently and get plenty of time with grandma and grandpa, the only time your kids get to spend time with grandma and grandpa is with their cousins. Yep cousin time is important, but so is time with your parents and just your kids. You need to have a serious conversation with your parents about that fact that your kids want some time with just them and some time with the cousins.", "More info needed:\n\n\nIt depends what the grandparents want. Do they want more time with you kids and less with sisters? \n\nWhen my child visits in-laws they often won\u2019t tell SIL so they can have more time with my child. They have SILs child most days of the week and she can be a handful.\n\n\nAlso do the children spend good time together? A 8 year old and 17 month olds may not play that much together, what about ages of other children? \n\n\nMy child and SILs child are at ages where they don\u2019t interact much yet. They don\u2019t gain a lot by the other child being around.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
