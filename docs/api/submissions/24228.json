No one should assume a sibling should put their life and their plans on hold for a disabled sibling. They cannot pass on POA of your sister to you without you approving and agreeing. They may put anything in their will they want, but it doesn\u2019t mean you have to accept. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to do, but if you know the law firm/lawyer that set up their wills and POA you could contact them and tell them that you are not agreeing to this arrangement.\n\nI think it would be worth the cost of a consultation with a family law attorney to find out what your options are to put your mind at ease.", "NTA - She's your sister, not your child, you don't have the obligation to take care of her. Whether it's morally okay or not isn't the matter here, what matters is that you always let your parents know you wanted your own life. Now when you say you want your own life they act surprised. This may be controversial", "NTA and your parents need to figure this out now. \nThey also should see a lawyer about the finances because if your sister inherits, that could be counted against any aid she may be eligible for.", "NTA, and the only time better than now to be talking about this is ten years ago. If you do not want to provide serious long term care for your sister you do not have to, and it is not wrong of you to decline. This type of care should really only be provided by people who do it gladly with an open heart, or it will lead to resentment, breakdown of the relationship, and substandard care. Your parents should have taken you seriously when you said no before and started coming up with alternate plans. I\u2019m not going to come down too hard on them because it\u2019s truly a difficult situation for them as well to grapple with the future care of a child they must love very much, and it\u2019s hard to put trust in a care facility. But there are a lot of great facilities and/or in-home care services and carers out there. And just like in elder care with the stigma around retirement homes, a lot of people underestimate the benefits of actual professional care. That kind of routine and structure is often beneficial to people whose mental state leaves them unable to care for themselves for one reason or another. But it can still be a hard transition. Your parents might want to consider that if that is their only realistic option it\u2019s something that may benefit everyone to start before your sister has to adjust to a new living situation at the same time as the loss of one or both of her parents.", "NTA.  Your parents need to find an attorney and act to protect your sister.  Whether you are trustee is up to you. You need your own attorney.  Imposing a dependent on you without your consent is wrong.", "Nta. At least the convo is happening now  I\u2019m sorry they are putting that expectation on you. You deserve to live your own life. And they definitely need to get a will in place. My parents passed 8 years ago and I\u2019m still dealing with all the paperwork", "Nta\n\nFirst off, they wouldn't have to really re do any paperwork, because they would need your signature to finalize something like that. \n\nSecond. Just suggest they make her the sole beneficiary, and that the money would be used towards her care in a facility that they can find  *before* they pass.", "Taking over poa just means you will make medical decisions, if you get financial poa then you control her money. You/parents can arrange for her to live in a home with assistance or other family member, etc. Poa does not mean you have to take care of her daily needs. Sit down with your parents and a lawyer and make a plan. They can decide where she will go etc, but you will make overall important medical and/or financial decisions. You don\u2019t have to do any of it if you don\u2019t want to but absolutely be prepared for fall out with your parents. NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would rather get nothing and have nothing to do with that, than to get *all* of that.", "ESH\n\nIt\u2019s fine to not want to take care of your sister, but this seems like a situation where the way in which everyone said their parts makes everything worse.\n\nPatents are TA for guilt tripping.\n\nYTA for acting like a bratty teenager. POA doesn\u2019t mean what you think it does. Adding in hypotheticals also doesn\u2019t help.", "Yep. YTA. How could you possibly NOT take care of her? FFS.", "No means no - and OP has the right to say it.", "It's unfortunate that her sister is disabled, but that's not her responsibility.  She should not have to change her life plans with her spouse because of that.  She can definitely help in different ways, but it's extremely unfair to take on the responsibility of taking care of a disabled adult when not trained to do so just because her family expects it.  There are many different ways to resolve this, which the parents could help take care of while they're still alive.  And if she does agree, the POA will give her the funding so she can find care specialists who would be more fit than her.", "Because op can't just stop her entire life to take care of her sister for the rest of one of their lives. \n\nLike she said, what is she supposed to do, never move, never get married, never have kids, the rest of her life now dedicated to a life she has no say in? \n\nThere are care facilities that the patented l parents can entrust their other daughter to. Op has a stable life and doesn't need the inheritance. It can all go towards the sister to make sure she is taken care of in one of these.", "It sounds like your sister is going to need assisted living once your parents pass.  If that's the case, it really does make more sense for you to inherit everything, otherwise the state will take all her assets.  It would be up to you to administer those funds as needed for her personal needs.  \n\nIf you are not interested in doing this for your sister, then your parents should enlist a fiduciary.  They are going to charge for that service, so you might end up inheriting less.", "They should really be working to transition her now as what will happen when they die? It will be a sudden shock to her which will be far more disruptive.\n\n\nNTA. People die all the time. You may actually doe first from COVID, flu, child birth, car accident, alien abduction, etc.", " NTA.  And as for the POA, you have to be willing.  They can\u2019t just say \u201cthis is how it will be\u201d.  No lawyer needed.  They can\u2019t do that.  They do need to get their affairs in order tho.", "NTA If Sister can't live independently, they should start looking into group homes and ideally transition her to one while they're still alive. They can talk with a lawyer to set up a trust to pay for her care after they die.", "NTA\n\nThey need to be looking into State resources, how to set her up\n\nIt\u2019s no one\u2019s responsibility but theirs", "NTA. She isn't your responsibility and it is absurd that your parents think it should be.", "NTA if you are in US I imagine they will try to blackmail you, by telling you will get nothing after their death. If you are fine with that's ok, if you are not ok with this you can consider the art of lying. Not to be left with all their assets, but your half of it. Curate your lies well.", "Some sort of plan needs to be put in place for who is handling decisions about her medical and life care. Deciding what facility, etc. I have no idea what would happen to someone who was not capable of living solo but who didn't have some sort of legal guardian or trustee.\n\nIf your parents don't have a will, they need to speak to a lawyer. Some kind of trust to provide for her care should be established, and a lawyer can advise how to go about this. If they just leave the money, problems down the road are practically guaranteed. If your aunt takes the sister, and she passes, then who will be responsible? Would that money go to her heirs, with no legal protection for your sister?\n\nAnd yes, the responsible thing is for OP's sister to recieve the full inheritance for what will be a lifetime of increasing care. If she dies first, whatever is left can go to OP. A lawyer would have to advise on that as well since it doesn't sound like she has the mental competence to make a legal will.", "Nta but consider what you are willing to do.\n\nI get that you don't want to take on care for her.\n\nWould you be willing for your sister to go to assisted living with you visiting regularly and acting as an advocate for her and giving her pocket money outside of what welfare she would he on.\n\nThere's a spectrum between taking full responsibility and not having a role.\n\nDecide what you would be willing to do if anything and make that clear to your parents.\n\nYour parents don't have a will so they haven't set anything up. I guess they are in the process at the moment so now is an ideal time to communicate.", "She's 32, why isn't she in a group home or assisted living facility or somthing similar? There are places with different levels of care, from round the clock supervision to almost i dependant living.", "NTA and they're fools for not having a will in place. What happens if, gods forbid, something happens to you while they're still alive? What then? \n\nNevertheless, you are not responsible for taking care of her for the rest of your life.", "NTA - the fact is nobody knows who is going to die next.  \nYou could die before your parents (not wishing it on anybody)", "NTA.\n\nIf your parents are truly concerned, a more logical approach would be to set up a trust where your sister is the beneficiary, which would be used to provide for her needs.\n\nHave her place in an assisted living facility, and the funds for the trust be used to pay for her costs. Perhaps set up the trust that you or a lawyer are in charge of managing the trust and are the ones in charge of making any major medical decisions, if your sister has a lack of mental capacity", "NTA. Your parents had a job to do and that was set each of you up to be independent adults. In your sister\u2019s case they have failed to do that or failed to put the proper care in place for her for once they die. Now they are trying to pass the responsibility onto you regardless of the fact that you have consistently said no. You did not sign up for this. If they are trying to strong arm you into becoming POA for her and giving up your life to caring for her I would lawyer up. Show them you are serious in a way they might just understand. You do not owe them or your sister the rest of your life.", "can you even be forced to do anything at all if you havent signed anything? i mean you have the authority over what you do or dont. NTA either way. high time to get this sorted out. they are trying to ruin your entire future and make you hate your sister", "NTA - Dump them. This is why we need more things like group homes, though.", "NTA.  They need to look into other care options.  Its a bit much just to dump it on you without proper thought or planning.", "NTA, they can\u2019t just drop this all on you with no plan in place etc", "NTA she should be living in an adult family home if your mom isn\u2019t around to take care of her. You could still have POA but not have to take care of her yourself.", "Just relax, you have zero obligation to care for your sister. Make it clear to your parents that you won't be caring for her, and then what they do with their wills etc. is their business.", "Because she has the right to live a life too?? Ffs, why should she sacrifice her life??"]}
