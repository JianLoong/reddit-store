I'm not even sure how she would react being told that if she were to ho to assisted living since my mom always used it as a *kick out* type of threat for when she was misbehaving.

Your parents should have taken you seriously when you said no before and started coming up with alternate plans. I\u2019m not going to come down too hard on them because it\u2019s truly a difficult situation for them as well to grapple with the future care of a child they must love very much, and it\u2019s hard to put trust in a care facility. But there are a lot of great facilities and/or in-home care services and carers out there. And just like in elder care with the stigma around retirement homes, a lot of people underestimate the benefits of actual professional care. That kind of routine and structure is often beneficial to people whose mental state leaves them unable to care for themselves for one reason or another. But it can still be a hard transition. Your parents might want to consider that if that is their only realistic option it\u2019s something that may benefit everyone to start before your sister has to adjust to a new living situation at the same time as the loss of one or both of her parents.", "NTA.

Would that money go to her heirs, with no legal protection for your sister?\n\nAnd yes, the responsible thing is for OP's sister to recieve the full inheritance for what will be a lifetime of increasing care.

The remains of their estate can be granted to fund your sister's care in an assisted living type situation where she can be more independent. However, your parents have failed your sister in that they've not taught her to live independently. This needs to be something they begin to rectify right now.", "NTA- and let me tell you this. If you make sure your sister is in a living situation that is not abusive and provides community outings and a structured routine chances for friends and such. \n\nAnd you visit her at least once a month and maybe take her out to lunch.\n\nAnd randomly call the location and check in on her.  \n\nThat would be enough. \n\nBecause disabled adults who don't have anyone to do those things, are more likely to be abused by staff, because they can see no one cares.\n\n* I am not stating this because it is your responsibility, It is not,you live your best life.\nI'm stating what taking care of your sister can look like and you'd still be doing a damn good job as a sister*", "Damn, I had forgotten all about that aspect.

So in their heads they've already kicked the can to you via their investment manager, not a proper will. \n\nEven if you were hunky-dory with this situation I'd strongly recommend to your parents that they need a proper will with a Special Needs Trust established for your sister. Those kind of trusts avoid income/death taxes and would still leave your sister able to receive state assistance if necessary, which will likely be part of the equation if no one in the family is willing or able to become the primary caregiver.
