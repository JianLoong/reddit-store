No one should assume a sibling should put their life and their plans on hold for a disabled sibling. They cannot pass on POA of your sister to you without you approving and agreeing. They may put anything in their will they want, but it doesn\u2019t mean you have to accept. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to do, but if you know the law firm/lawyer that set up their wills and POA you could contact them and tell them that you are not agreeing to this arrangement.\n\nI think it would be worth the cost of a consultation with a family law attorney to find out what your options are to put your mind at ease.", "NTA - She's your sister, not your child, you don't have the obligation to take care of her. Whether it's morally okay or not isn't the matter here, what matters is that you always let your parents know you wanted your own life. Now when you say you want your own life they act surprised. This may be controversial", "NTA and your parents need to figure this out now. \nThey also should see a lawyer about the finances because if your sister inherits, that could be counted against any aid she may be eligible for.", "NTA, and the only time better than now to be talking about this is ten years ago. If you do not want to provide serious long term care for your sister you do not have to, and it is not wrong of you to decline. This type of care should really only be provided by people who do it gladly with an open heart, or it will lead to resentment, breakdown of the relationship, and substandard care. Your parents should have taken you seriously when you said no before and started coming up with alternate plans. I\u2019m not going to come down too hard on them because it\u2019s truly a difficult situation for them as well to grapple with the future care of a child they must love very much, and it\u2019s hard to put trust in a care facility. But there are a lot of great facilities and/or in-home care services and carers out there. And just like in elder care with the stigma around retirement homes, a lot of people underestimate the benefits of actual professional care. That kind of routine and structure is often beneficial to people whose mental state leaves them unable to care for themselves for one reason or another. But it can still be a hard transition. Your parents might want to consider that if that is their only realistic option it\u2019s something that may benefit everyone to start before your sister has to adjust to a new living situation at the same time as the loss of one or both of her parents.", "NTA.  Your parents need to find an attorney and act to protect your sister.  Whether you are trustee is up to you. You need your own attorney.  Imposing a dependent on you without your consent is wrong.", "Nta. At least the convo is happening now  I\u2019m sorry they are putting that expectation on you. You deserve to live your own life. And they definitely need to get a will in place. My parents passed 8 years ago and I\u2019m still dealing with all the paperwork", "Nta\n\nFirst off, they wouldn't have to really re do any paperwork, because they would need your signature to finalize something like that. \n\nSecond. Just suggest they make her the sole beneficiary, and that the money would be used towards her care in a facility that they can find  *before* they pass.", "Taking over poa just means you will make medical decisions, if you get financial poa then you control her money. You/parents can arrange for her to live in a home with assistance or other family member, etc. Poa does not mean you have to take care of her daily needs. Sit down with your parents and a lawyer and make a plan. They can decide where she will go etc, but you will make overall important medical and/or financial decisions. You don\u2019t have to do any of it if you don\u2019t want to but absolutely be prepared for fall out with your parents. NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

POA doesn\u2019t mean what you think it does. Adding in hypotheticals also doesn\u2019t help.", "Yep. YTA. How could you possibly NOT take care of her? FFS.", "No means no - and OP has the right to say it.", "It's unfortunate that her sister is disabled, but that's not her responsibility.  She should not have to change her life plans with her spouse because of that.  She can definitely help in different ways, but it's extremely unfair to take on the responsibility of taking care of a disabled adult when not trained to do so just because her family expects it.  There are many different ways to resolve this, which the parents could help take care of while they're still alive.  And if she does agree, the POA will give her the funding so she can find care specialists who would be more fit than her.", "Because op can't just stop her entire life to take care of her sister for the rest of one of their lives. \n\nLike she said, what is she supposed to do, never move, never get married, never have kids, the rest of her life now dedicated to a life she has no say in? \n\nThere are care facilities that the patented l parents can entrust their other daughter to. Op has a stable life and doesn't need the inheritance. It can all go towards the sister to make sure she is taken care of in one of these."]}
