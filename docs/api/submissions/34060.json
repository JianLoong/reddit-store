{"id": 34060, "submission_id": "18uqpo5", "title": "AITA for texting my wife \"your sister is welcome to stay\"?", "selftext": "My SIL (33f) was visiting us from out of town and staying with us (35m / 35f) for a week between Christmas and New Year. We were supposed to go out last night but I got into a silly fight with my wife so I stormed off and went home by myself. I won't get into the details of this argument, because I accept the bulk of the culpability for it and it's not the point of this AITA question. It is probably worth noting for context that there has been simmering tension between me and my wife lately, to the point she brought up if it would make sense for us to take time apart. \n\nWhen I arrived home, I concluded it would be best for me to leave the apartment for the rest of SIL's stay, which had another 48 hours remaining as her flight could not be changed. We're in a 1BR NYC apartment (with SIL staying in our living room) so it's impossible not to be in each other's face all the time. I believed SIL would feel uncomfortable due to the tension and my continued presence would effectively force her out of our place, which I considered would be unfair to her. Besides, SIL is currently a grad student living off a student loan with a ridiculously high interest rate and she would be paying exorbitant hotel rates in NYC during New Year's Eve weekend, whereas I have enough credit card points to make the out-of-pocket expenses a minimal consideration.\n\nTherefore, I texted my wife as follows:\n\n\"I'm leaving the house at 9pm and plan to return on Jan 1. Let's talk in person then. Your sister is welcome to stay until then.\"\n\nAt 8:45pm, I had finished packing my overnight bag when, to my surprise, my wife and SIL arrived at the apartment. SIL accused me of being extremely rude, taking particular umbrage with the last sentence of my text.\n\n\"Well, I said that out of consideration for you. I admit I am at fault for this fight with your sister, so I was merely offering to minimize the inconvenience to you, our guest, by my leaving instead,\" I responded.\n\nSIL declared, \"I'm an adult and you do not tell me whether to stay or leave!\" With that, SIL grabbed her things and ventured off into the December night, a single woman with no plans in a city she is unfamiliar with, which is exactly what I feared and had tried to prevent.\n\nMy wife is now mad at me for giving SIL no option but to leave by saying she is welcome to stay. I'm baffled because it was intended to be anything but that. \n\nAITA for this sentence? I could have handled the situation better overall but the sisters are convinced that my saying SIL is welcome to stay is the chief offense of all. \n\nA second, related AITA question: After SIL exited, I wondered out aloud to my wife, \"Well, should I at least offer to book your sister a hotel room?\" But since SIL had left to make the point that she is an independent woman, I did not pursue this option further and now my wife is also angry about this.\n\nAITA for not reaching out to SIL and offering to book her a hotel room?\n\nETA: See comment for context of original argument.", "created_utc": 1703972913, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18uqpo5/aita_for_texting_my_wife_your_sister_is_welcome/", "score": 195, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would never put up with that kind of behavior from my spouse. You deserve better.", "I already voted NTA but like...don't take the blame for your wife's own problems. She is the one who made a problem out of the evening, and then continued to make a problem out of it along with her sister. \n\nHonestly, this sounds like a very toxic relationship where your wife blames you for everything despite you doing nothing to garner such hatred. This won't last...it's not a healthy relationship.", "It\u2019s your wife. Your wife is the problem (and her sister may possibly be a little like her it seems). NTA. \nPlease get some marriage counseling. Her reaction to her perceived poor seats at a sold show is definitely off.", "Info - are you usually late for things? Yes, 3 minutes is small, but her reaction may lead one to think that you are usually late to things.", "INFO are you in the habit of taking the blame when your wife is unhappy? The fight looks mostly her fault and it looks like she and her sister are looking to be offended.", "I wouldn\u2019t say this is so silly - your wife does sound like a hypersensitive AH who ruined the night of two other people", "Please add this context comment on original post in edit, instead of saying \"context in comment\".  Your comment will be buried in load of comments, until then  teens of reddit would be ready with pitch fork to crucify you in comments.", "From this, I don't think you were at fault in the fight. If it's a sold out show, you can't switch seats and her tantrum about it was ridiculous and rude.", "INFO needed, Was the fight about her sister staying with you? Why did you need to say she can stay? \n\nI think it\u2019s dumb she left but was your last sentence like a taunt of some sort ?", "Wow you are a huge enabler.\n\nNo, he should not \u201clisten to his wife better\u201d when she is being toxic.", "Go look at what the fight was over, wife is huge AH.", "Also it was to his wife, so it sounds like he was trying to clear up that he was just trying to remove himself from the situation until after her sister's trip was done and didn't want to inconvenience her sister over their fight. She then chose to show her sister so they could both act indignant about it. They sound like the most difficult people to be in social settings around, and if what OP said is true, I'm kind of annoyed he apologized for the fight his wife started over seats.", "He clearly says in the OP that sil was staying for another 48 hours.", "New York is one of the safest big cities in the country.", "For context, a couple of days before this, SIL made a big fuss about not wanting to impose and said she would get a hotel room for the last day or two of her trip in town which I thought was unnecessary. I talked her out of that and insisted that she do no such thing. So the question of her leaving had been already discussed, which was why I wanted to express that she should still stay.", "But he sent the text to his wife, not the SIL. He might have used different words if he had talked to SIL directly. Wife CHOSE to show the text to SIL which was unnecessary.", "Don't feed into that doofus. You've done nothing wrong. That person and your sil are nuts.", "Your wife and her sister sound exhausting dude", "I don't know, I didn't get that at all from what you wrote.\n\nIf you really wrote it exactly like you said then \"welcome to stay\" really just means she's free to stay there.\n\nOthers are seeing it as some power play but I think it's at least equally easy to read it as \"I hope my outburst of storming out of the restaurant and out of our apartment doesn't make your sister think she's done anything wrong.\"\n\nAdmittedly I haven't read your comment about the source of the fight yet, but when I read your text message I didn't get any negative vibes at all. I feel like someone would have to be reaching to find one. Which, if she was already pissed at you anyway, or you have a history of being very passive aggressive, I could see interpreting it that way.\n\nI just think you have to work to make that sentence rude, it's not inherently rude or aggressive.\n\nEdit: I just read your comment about the fight and now I agree with myself even more, lol. I really don't think you were in the wrong for this and I think you tried to let your SiL know she didn't need to feel awkward about the drama.\n\nI also don't think you were wrong to not try and find her a hotel room. They chose to take offense for no reason and she chose to storm off into the night. You did what you could", "\"Your sister is welcome to stay\" makes it sound like her welcome was in question. If it wasn't in question, why phrase it like that?", "It quite literally could just be three raccoons in a trench coat, that's how little this makes sense.", "I read the details, but also noted that OP said he accepts the \u201cbulk of the responsibility for it\u201d (his words, not mine).\n\nIf so, that is something he should have communicated to his wife. That\u2019s the point of my message - he expects them to judge him on intent he didn\u2019t communicate in his message. That\u2019s not how adults work things out.\n\nAs a side note, chewing his wife, then storming away, then packing and leaving for a few days, with nothing but a vague message, is far from making OP a saint either.\n\nThey need help learning to communicate with each other. Couples therapy, for instance.", "No, not usually late to things.", "Idk man I don't think you can count on his telling of it. His entire post kind of screams \"I think I know better than women in all things\". Just a generally unwarranted belief in his own better judgment and intellect.\n\nLeaving the house on the sister's behalf... without feeling the need to talk to her or even his wife about what is in fact a huge deal. Staying in a hotel after a fight is major.\n\nDescribing her finding a hotel for herself as... and I can't believe I can actually quote this... \"a single woman with no plans in a city she is unfamiliar with, which is exactly what I feared\". (wow)\n\nThe discussion about whether the sister should stay being her \"making a big fuss\". To a lot of people it would just be being polite and not wanting to impose.\n\nAnd now the wife was \"making a scene\"? That's a hard sell. I think he's blowing it out of proportion. Cry wolf one too many times...", "I would add in OP but for the fact that it is already at the 3000 character limit.", "See my separate comment for more info.", "Ayo I added the edits where I said I wrote what was below before the added context, but didn\u2019t delete what I wrote prior. Literally said \u201cI wrote below before you said what the fight is about\u201d\n\n\nIm not an enabler, I am an internet stranger.", "Hmm I edited. But. How bizarre for adults to act across the board.", "Completely skipped over that despite reading it multiple times lmao. Oh well.", "Hmmm YTA, very unpleasant", "I was wondering if it was a veiled threat to his wife since they were arguing.", "Same.", "I'm one of those over thinking types and even I don't read anything into what this guy said. People just grasping as straws to make him the bad guy.", "Username checks out.  (Or its intentional troll comment given the username ) lol", "It sounded more to me like OP is used to walking on eggshells around his wife", "I think there is not character limit for edit .", "If it keeps coming up can you do an edit ?", "Oh - I thought that was part of your last edit? Guess I misunderstood.", "How is that unpleasant?\n\nHmmmmmmmmmm?", "huh? how? why?", "Gosh, yes, how unpleasant for OP to be solicitous, generous, welcoming, and kind. Man, I just hate people like that. /s", "It\u2019s Reddit remember the bloke is always wrong.", "I'm going to quote it again because I don't know how you can get past this line and still see nothing off about his take of things.\n\n\"a single woman with no plans in a city she is unfamiliar with, which is exactly what I feared\"\n\nThis is a fully functional adult he's talking about. He has no reason to doubt her ability to call a cab or find a hotel. Doing something alone is not an overwhelming task for a woman.", "I would but the addition would put the OP above the 3000 character limit.", "Name checks out", "Where do you live, that women can walk around alone in and not have to worry about harassment and danger lurking at every corner? \n\nSource: am a single woman who often has to go places alone \n\nThis is not a derogatory description. It's reality. I'd love to be able to parade down the street in a bikini and high heels and not worry sbout bring harassed and attacked. That will never, ever happen. I never go anywhere without some way to protect myself, regardless of how well I know the area or how safe it might be. There's also a lot of merit to the phrase \"strength in numbers.\" Danger is EVERYWHERE for women. \n\nI do see where you're coming from, but I think OP is (1) afraid of angering his wife and (2) trying really hard to bot make things worse. I don't think it's OP bring toxic or derogatory or anything else. It's hard when you're in a cmitted relationship with a toxic and/or abusive person. You try so hard to not rock the boat, and often get reamed out anyways\u2014like OP in this situation.", "Edits don't count toward the character limits, I believe.", "Okay the I\u2019ll go with nta but it sounds like you can do no right, hopefully you guys are able to afford the marriage counselling because this sounds like your wife and her sister assume the worst from your messages and go with that.", "I genuinely can't imagine what you could find toxic about my last comment.\n\nYou should reconsider your views on women if you actually found that line of his to be a totally reasonable and rational take.", "Where do YOU live that you can't leave the house at night?\n\nNo one is talking about a bikini and high heels. All we're talking about a woman leaving the house at a reasonable hour without an escort. Do you seriously never go out at night?", "It\u2019s not just that comment, it\u2019s the entire chain, you are enabling toxicity.\n\nI promise you my views on women are fine lol."]}
