{"id": 34060, "submission_id": "18uqpo5", "title": "AITA for texting my wife \"your sister is welcome to stay\"?", "selftext": "My SIL (33f) was visiting us from out of town and staying with us (35m / 35f) for a week between Christmas and New Year. We were supposed to go out last night but I got into a silly fight with my wife so I stormed off and went home by myself. I won't get into the details of this argument, because I accept the bulk of the culpability for it and it's not the point of this AITA question. It is probably worth noting for context that there has been simmering tension between me and my wife lately, to the point she brought up if it would make sense for us to take time apart. \n\nWhen I arrived home, I concluded it would be best for me to leave the apartment for the rest of SIL's stay, which had another 48 hours remaining as her flight could not be changed. We're in a 1BR NYC apartment (with SIL staying in our living room) so it's impossible not to be in each other's face all the time. I believed SIL would feel uncomfortable due to the tension and my continued presence would effectively force her out of our place, which I considered would be unfair to her. Besides, SIL is currently a grad student living off a student loan with a ridiculously high interest rate and she would be paying exorbitant hotel rates in NYC during New Year's Eve weekend, whereas I have enough credit card points to make the out-of-pocket expenses a minimal consideration.\n\nTherefore, I texted my wife as follows:\n\n\"I'm leaving the house at 9pm and plan to return on Jan 1. Let's talk in person then. Your sister is welcome to stay until then.\"\n\nAt 8:45pm, I had finished packing my overnight bag when, to my surprise, my wife and SIL arrived at the apartment. SIL accused me of being extremely rude, taking particular umbrage with the last sentence of my text.\n\n\"Well, I said that out of consideration for you. I admit I am at fault for this fight with your sister, so I was merely offering to minimize the inconvenience to you, our guest, by my leaving instead,\" I responded.\n\nSIL declared, \"I'm an adult and you do not tell me whether to stay or leave!\" With that, SIL grabbed her things and ventured off into the December night, a single woman with no plans in a city she is unfamiliar with, which is exactly what I feared and had tried to prevent.\n\nMy wife is now mad at me for giving SIL no option but to leave by saying she is welcome to stay. I'm baffled because it was intended to be anything but that. \n\nAITA for this sentence? I could have handled the situation better overall but the sisters are convinced that my saying SIL is welcome to stay is the chief offense of all. \n\nA second, related AITA question: After SIL exited, I wondered out aloud to my wife, \"Well, should I at least offer to book your sister a hotel room?\" But since SIL had left to make the point that she is an independent woman, I did not pursue this option further and now my wife is also angry about this.\n\nAITA for not reaching out to SIL and offering to book her a hotel room?\n\nETA: See comment for context of original argument.", "created_utc": 1703972913, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18uqpo5/aita_for_texting_my_wife_your_sister_is_welcome/", "score": 615, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The guy accepted responsibility for being wrong, gave the SIL her space, and gave her permission to stay at HIS HOUSE.\n\nHe couldn't have done anything more for her. E S H? Seriously?", "right?  and she has this poor guy so broken he thinks it's actually his fault!", "That is some leap to take just from a few sentences. \n\nI think the worst thing OP did was write \"until then\". That sounds rather forceful, like she has to be out when you get back. OP could have just left that out. \n\nBut honestly, it's just a few words. I would've just simply asked to clarify what he meant instead of assuming the worst in people. \n\nI hate it when people take one sentence and play gotcha like if they're infallible over text.
