This way you can have your boundary  while leaving the parenting to her mother.", "That's your only option. She's already proven she won't respect rules or you. Well, you could call the police and have her end up in the justice system, but that's worse than telling her she's going to be finding another home.", "If you aren\u2019t willing to evict them than maybe impose I financial penalty to your sister. After all she is the one responsible for her daughter. If she\u2019s not willing to really make an effort to curb behaviors from her daughter, that you don\u2019t want in your house, then hold her accountable. I know you say you have financial arrangements made already with bills, etc. but this is different. I mean ultimately since you aren\u2019t willing to evict, I don\u2019t see any other recourse you have.", "She has realized there are no consequences to her actions. If you truthfully expect her to respect you and listen to you at this point I honestly think you\u2019re delusional. \n\nI understand wanting to help people. I understand not wanting to put them out on the street. But you, my dear, are enabling her behavior by not teaching her that all actions have consequences.\n\nAnd though I do not agree with you going through her room, say this is the action you take\u2026what happens when you find it? The answer is nothing. Because again, no consequences. What about the next time, and the time after that? If you expect rules to be followed you lay out consequences to them being broken, and then you stick to them. Otherwise, you\u2019re a door mat.", "Well just roll over and take it.  She obviously knows there are no consequences for her actions.\n\nThere is nothing you can do.  She knows how weak you are.", "Oh well.", "INFO: are her parents there? Have a conversation with them. If they can\u2019t get her in line then you\u2019ll need to either get them out or learn to live with it. Can she be grounded? Have privileges taken away?", "Then, plan on living with the problem.  There are no consequences for her doing it, so she is not going to stop.", "It\u2019s about the only thing you have to put on the table. Being told not to hasn\u2019t worked. Searching their room won\u2019t result in them not doing these things and will definitely destroy any relationship you want. The parents are who needs to deal with it, so that\u2019s the next step, you aren\u2019t the person to parent, even if it is your house. You can set the rules, but their child\u2019s issues with the rules are where they need to be stepping up and addressing it. For you, the only things you have in your pocket is it\u2019s your house and thus you control their living situation. So you don\u2019t have a or of cards to play. (And again stop thinking police state is a card that will work or is appropriate for you to play.) The parents are the ones who should hold more cards and strategies to deal with this. They have other disciplinary and corrective options as parents than you do.\n\nYou also have to understand that if you want this resolved amicably, because your idea will not lead to good relationships as an outcome, that you need to be working on de-escalating the conflict, not throwing it into privacy breaching levels of escalation. You don\u2019t wanna be in a power struggle with a teenager when you have taken your only real card off the table. Especially as only a tangential authority figure. The second you throw up the angry my house, my rules and tell them what they are going to do, you are fucked. You just made a threat you say you won\u2019t follow through on. They know it. They know you aren\u2019t their parent. You need to engage them calmly and in a conversation not an order. Talk to them. It\u2019s probably gonna take a few talks. Their parents are the ones that need to be applying the pressure and you\u2019re good cop. You don\u2019t tell them not to smoke, you ask them not to do so in the house. It\u2019s not your role to involve yourself in what they are doing outside of the fact that it\u2019s in your house. So stick to that. Do what you do, but please be considerate of those around you and don\u2019t do it in here. You can push more if you can develop a relationship, but right now it doesn\u2019t seem like you have a close enough one at the moment to do so. You need to be the one not coming down on them, just asking for consideration, calmly, without judgement, coming to them as a person, not a subordinate. You cannot our anger, petty, and drama a teenager. It\u2019s not a winning proposal unless you are ready to put your one card on the table.", "Can you just get her to smoke outside? Getting someone to stop taking nicotine or weed is generally\u2026 not going to work.", "If she\u2019s not your kid, you really don\u2019t have any right to tell her what to do. \n\nYou\u2019re also under no obligation to let her live with you.", "How would you find her stashes with out snooping?", "What makes you thinking searching her room will even work? She will just get more clever at hiding it and continue to vape.", "So why doesn't she deserve privacy", "Yeah. Sister should probably do more to handle this, she\u2019s had the same loss of your mother, so probably has similar concerns, but might be overwhelmed too.   \n\n\nWifi is the gateway to a teens heart :P", "It sounds like you\u2019ve been taught that love is being a doormat. It\u2019s not. If you love them you will do what\u2019s best for them, and that includes a reality check and respecting the free home they\u2019re in", "Then you will keep having this problem.  You and the the teens parents need to come to a shared agreement.  And that may not work if there isn\u2019t a cost to them for breaking it.", "It's a matter of tough love.   If what your sister is doing isn't working, she has to step up and get help.   She won't do that as long as she thinks you'll always fold.", "Meh, you just sound like a narc.", "Then spent have them in your home. \n\nSearching her room will only make things worse.\n\nPerhaps just the threat of losing the housing would be enough. Or start with a financial penalty \n\nBut nothing will change unless you she knows there are consequences", "This is her problem to take on and resolve. She needs to check her room, although keep in mind that kids really know how to hide things. I hate to say it, but a weekly at-home THC nicotine teat may be the option. But, you\u2019re upset about this; so either be willing to follow through on an ultimatum or don\u2019t do anything.", "Your intended approach won\u2019t work either. \n\nSo this child has zero repercussions for not following the rules? You do understand then that the blame for why she continues this, and treats you (and I\u2019m assuming her mom) with such disrespect is because she\u2019s not being held accountable. I\u2019m not saying to kick her out or to threaten to, because it\u2019s clear from other comments you refuse to, and if you won\u2019t follow through on it then don\u2019t say it. But work with her mother and find another form of punishment that you both will follow through on\u2026and then stick to it (and tearing her room apart to find things isn\u2019t a form of punishment).", "Sorry that's total BS.", "Then unfortunately it'll probably keep happening. That's really your only recourse. In any situation that involves a landlord, they would already be fined and/or kicked out. I think taking it is a bad move. It's only going to piss her off and make her rebel more and she'll find other ways to get access to it or hide it. It just wouldn't solve your problem. It doesn't matter if your sister is overwhelmed, it's still her responsibility as a parent to give her child consequences, not yours. If she needs help, that's fine. Just maybe have a sit down conversation with her and try to tackle this with a unified approach.", "I get it. Some people are sensitive to that stuff. And/or she must be really cranking it if it's enough to actually smell bad (edit: and yes, smoking smells bad regardless). I point that out just to make sure you're not adding to the problem by undermining yourself instead of fixing it.", "i can't lie it does smell but i think weed laws are truly bs and as someone who's had/has depression, anxiety, and maybe bpd, weed, and even more specifically mushrooms have helped me alter my brain chemistry in a way nothing else has. I think everything is meant to be consumed in moderation, but weed actually calms my anxiety and helps me become more self aware and navigate my internal world, so it's surprising you say it's bad for mental health. It truly has liberated me", "Illuminate me on what I missed", "16 year olds don't typically have unlimited funds. Eventually it will become too expensive to continue replacing what op throws out.", "She is, and has had a couple stints in the hospital. That's part of why I won't kick them out. My sister is already so stressed, and the kid could take it as a value judgment on herself as a person, which I never want to happen.", "Weed is actually contraindicated for what she has going on, but I do think that idea was why she picked it up in the first place.", "It's weakness to not want to harm people you love??? That's why I was trying to come up with something else...", "There has to be something besides making people homeless.", "She a minor. Plus my house is big but my yard is not, so it would come in through windows. Not an option for both reasons.", "That stuff stinks. That's how I keep finding out in the first place.", "I haven't searched and I have still found out because it stinks.", "I've been giving her privacy this whole time. I just don't know what to do.", "if she respected the reasonable rules of the house like not smoking indoors her privacy would remain intact. Privacy is not an absolute right.", "It doesn't make someone a narc to not want a minor consuming illegal substances in their home, and to not want to be exposed to secondhand smoke.", "Yeah, I get that, just frustrated and don't know what to do. And so many people are just telling me to kick them out. How is that a solution?", "I get that, just kinda don't know what to do.\n\nI actually can smell it on the first go, that stuff smells so bad to me. And I don't know why people are assuming I'm categorically opposed to weed for adults under reasonable circumstances in their own homes. A friend of mine has been on it medically for years and it's enabled her to come off of multiple other meds with much worse side effects. But it's in her own home, not mine, and she's an adult. And unlike my niece, it's a valid treatment for her. It's contraindicated for my niece.", "I say it's bad for certain disorders because science shows it is. Not all, but yes, some.", "It's harmful for her and everyone else in the home. Said that in the post.", "Well, I wish you luck, but you know nothing is going to change, right?", "Oh my God. Do not kick the whole family out because of this. Jesus christ reddit. She is 16. She is going to push boundaries and do things she shouldn't. That doesn't mean she deserves to be kicked out. I think you need to work with her parents to figure out punishments that will actually work and follow through on them. But expect her to keep pushing boundaries. That's what teens do. And putting up with it without going nuclear is part of being family.", "Yes when she obviously doesn\u2019t give two shits about you.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t love you.  Sh e doesn\u2019t care about you.  She\u2019s laughing at what a chump you are.", "I would make her share a room with a parent. They can babysit her. Take away the privilege of having a private room till she learns to show some respect.", "You find she has been SMOKING it by smell, bit can you sniff out hiding places? Does she keep it out in the open? I find it hard to believe you would not be looking through her stuff to find it.\n\nEdit a wrod", "Honestly tell her to do it outside. Give her a little spot she can do it in. You can say you don't approve of her doing this and walk her through the dangers and consequences of it. I wouldn't focus on healthy, but focus on addiction, how it can lead to trying other substances, how it can just make you lazy and unmotivated. You can disagree with her choice to smoke but at her age and your relationship you will not get her to stop by force she will buy more she will continue to use it. So accept her choice and ask her to do it in safe and respectful manner and try to convice her to change her habits, talk to her about moderation. Weed is mainstream now more then ever, honestly basiclly eveyone I know under the age of like 50 uses it.", "And?\n\nThis is the parents\u2019 job, and you haven\u2019t apparently even talked to them. \n\nYWBTA if you took her property.", "People here are really harsh on that. I wonder how many of them would actually kick out people they love but are unhappy with choices of...", "People with certain mental health disorders have behavior extremes. Even after dismissing me on this issue, she comes to find me to ask if I'll watch a movie with her. She still likes to lay her head on my shoulder, at 16. Not everyone shows their love in the right or healthiest ways. You're a real jerk.", "Hmm. Something to consider at least. Better than all the people just saying to kick them out.", "The regular vapes you only smell when it's being smoked. Cigarettes smell just in their package, and the cartridges of weed vapes stink all on their own, too. She accidentally destroyed a couch trying to hide one in it.", "I can't do that. You heard she's a minor, right? I can wave to the police from my front porch. I'm not getting arrested.\n\nAnd my yard is not that big, there is nowhere that wouldn't drift into windows.", "Yes, I have said repeatedly that I have talked with her mother. Her mother is trying, but her approach is clearly not working.", "Been there, done that. \n\nSome people push and push and push and push. If you step out of the way, instead of pushing you, they fall on their face.  So you got to be willing to be pushed or willing to let them fall on their face.", "......yet you have no problem making her lose any trust in you and making her hate you for invading her privacy?", "Her parents are jerks to her for not teaching her responsibility or respect. You're contributing to the situation by not putting your foot down.\n\nI'm glad you like cuddles with your 16yo niece, but that has zero bearing on her smoking pot/vaping in your home.", "I know that's the easy way out. She is not going to listen to you until there are some sort of consequences for her actions.", "And you think invading the kid\u2019s privacy and stealing their property is going to work?", "No, I do have a problem with it. I said I hate the idea. I haven't done it, was asking opinions. I just don't know what to do.", "Not really, just trying to come up with something, because this can't go on. You know that illegally obtained property would technically be subject to forfeiture, which it would be, since she did not get this stuff legally...", "Personally I'd have someone around her age talk to her about it.\n\nUnfortunately you're family. You're older. As far as she's concerned you don't get it, you'll never get it so what's the point in listening to you. You gotta get someone she's close in age to and respects to get down on her level and talk to her.\n\nThat's the only thing I can think of.", "Christ that is some power tripping thinking", "I suppose one of her older cousins might. I don't know.", "Just saying, it could be. Among the routes hey mother has tried was bringing her to the cops right after she caught her buying it."]}
