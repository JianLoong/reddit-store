Throwaway because family uses Reddit.\n\nI am unmarried and do not have children so I don't understand this situation from a parent's standpoint. I have a niece, Kay 21, and a nephew, Joe 16. My sister and her husband have spent the last few years (since the pandemic started) trying to get Kay sorted. By that I mean she has a lot of unexplained ailments. They've been seeing specialists, chiropractors, acupuncture, etc. To this day I'm still not entirely sure what is wrong. Kay posts on social media a lot about feeling fatigued, having migraines, weakness, and other symptoms along with her various appointments. Personally I worry this is being driven by attention because it has become her entire personality.\n\nI try to help Kay when I can (I've taken her to a few appointments because she doesn't drive) but I've tried to be present mostly for Joe who is overshadowed by all of this. Joe is a very simple young man and doesn't ask for much but I can tell he wants some attention. He makes this known by pushing himself in sports, getting the best grades, getting a job, and trying to be as independent as possible. He's 16 but acts 20. It kind of sucks to watch.\n\nFor his birthday I bought two tickets to a football game and transferred them to my sister so that she or her husband could take him. I told them that if they absolutely couldn't then I would but they accepted the tickets. Fast forward a couple weeks later and I see a post from my sister selling two football game tickets and they were very quickly bought. I confronted her and said those tickets were for Joe. Her response was they needed help covering new allergy testing for Kay and that's what the money would be used for.\n\nI took Joe to lunch yesterday and asked him how he is really doing. He was honest and said he doesn't feel like an equal member of his family and I told him I see it too. I asked him why he agreed to sell his birthday tickets and learned he never did and never even knew anything about them. I told him the sequence of events. He was quiet for a bit and then sighed and accepted it. To my surprise he must have said something to his parents because they called me for a conversation, accusing me of being an AH and saying I hurt Joe's feelings and that he was better off not knowing. I disagree wholeheartedly but am open to other perspectives. AITA?\n\nAnd yes I am trying to buy new tickets for Joe.\n\nUPDATE: \n\nI'll try to respond to people as I can. I spoke with Joe individually today. I'm not surprised, but he said he confronted them because he wanted them to give me the money back. As usual the kid is thinking of others.\n\n  \nWhile I don't want to be accused of trying to turn him against his parents, I do want to follow his lead in regards to him potentially staying with me. That said, I am going to make more of an effort to spend more time with him.\n\n  \nAs far as Kay is concerned. I know her health issues are very real and I want more than nothing for her to feel well. However, she has been behaving manipulatively towards her parents, grandparents, myself, and Joe for a while now. Again, I worry that how she is dealing with her ailments is unhealthy for her and the family. We all support her and do what we can to support her and help her to be well.", "created_utc": 1693148923, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162svfo/aita_for_telling_my_nephew_that_his_birthday/", "score": 3276, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At some point we all get a clue about how imperfect our parents are and we respond to these imperfections accordingly. But that doesn't mean we shun our parents and walk away from them in disgust. (There are other outcomes after finding out you've been lied to and ripped off is my only point.)\n\nAt any rate, their attempt to make you the bad guy after their misdeeds were exposed really speaks to what kind of people they've become. Entitled, and lacking moral compass is not a good look. Tell them so.\n\nAnd remember that as kids get older, we can gift them directly.

It was so wonderful to be seen. To be noticed as something more than an annoyance was an amazing gift.\n\nYou let your nephew know you see him.  He will cherish that moment.

Stand up for yourself and let them know exactly how it is. I would also inform people of what had transpired and DEMAND that they pay you back for the tickets you bought.

I was in the same position at her age. After years of searching we did figure out the correct diagnosis & proper treatment helped a lot, but until then I was just really sick and no one knew why.\n\nIt never was my entire personality, but I\u2019m sure some people in my life thought that it was because I became involved in chronic illness communities & would update people about my journey on social media. One thing a lot of people don\u2019t realize is that I was just sharing updates about my life the way anyone would. If I hadn\u2019t been too sick to stay in college those updates would have been about my studies & the fun trips I was doing & college friends. It wasn\u2019t that I lost that part of my personality, it was that I was too sick to so any of that stuff. I discussed dealing with illness because that was what was actually going on in my daily life - I can\u2019t really really about activities I\u2019m too sick to be doing (I did continue to talk a lot about the stuff I could continue to do). And I jumped into communities of chronically ill people because I lost access to my social circles when I had to leave school & wanted community of people experiencing the same thing I was. Illness wasn\u2019t my personality, it was just my reality. But sick people get judged for being open about their experiences in a way that we don\u2019t judge healthy people for discussing their lives in similar detail.\n\nAs soon as I had the energy to return to my regular life I did so. Because I was never attached to being sick, I was just talking about my life as it actually was and trying to make the most of a bad situation.\n\nAlso, I have always been slightly baffled by the common misconception that people might fake illness for attention. Any chronically ill person can tell you that it\u2019s incredibly isolating. Mostly just you just get ignored and left out. And there is a good chance your healthy friends will be so uncomfortable confronting illness that they just ghost you entirely. People feel so awkward and afraid of saying the wrong thing you often don\u2019t get even the smallest level of attention or concern", "NTA but I think you should tell everyone on social media what your sister did to your nephew, they won\u2019t even attempt to improve their behavior until they are shammed by their community.", "Yeah you are an asshole instead of talking to the parents you stirrup shit.

It was a sign of how they really feel that they sold the tickets to pay for ANOTHER allergy testing for their daughter. Maybe you don\u2019t want to adopt him but become the fun uncle that he stays with every now and then. Never give birthday gifts to the parents and maybe you could have an area in your house where he can put stuff that he wants to keep since his parents would rather sell his stuff and not tell him than let him have a single penny to himself.

Sometimes you see this with parents of a special needs child, any other kids they have tend to be kind of neglected. However, while I have understanding for it, that doesn't mean it isn't bad parenting. \n\nYou were right to tell Joe what happened, and you would have been right about it even if you knew for a fact they had hidden that from him, because he deserves to know. For all you know, maybe he thought you got him nothing and that wouldn't look great on you. \n\nAs others have said, next time give the gift directly to him.

That is no reason to steal from their other child.", "Your sister and her husband are real pieces of work. NTA. They certainly are.

Selling the tickets was definitely an asshole move. Why didn\u2019t they sell something of theirs (the parents). Money aside, it\u2019s also clear that they aren\u2019t putting any care into Joe. Selling the tickets was just a slap in the face. They will probably try to justify it by saying the tickets were a luxery and the testing is a necessity. \n\nBut again, what luxuries were they selling of theirs to afford this testing? I\u2019m also willing to bet that they aren\u2019t being good caretakers. I absolutely believe they care and want the best for Kay however you listed several alternative treatments. I bet the Chiro is super expensive and has them buying expensive pills and maybe shakes through them. I also wouldn\u2019t be shocked if this allergy test has been prescribed by the Chiro or a Naturopath yet it doesn\u2019t even look at the right markers to test for actual allergies. Most of these tests have highly questionable validity and are very expensive. The non medical doctors probably told them to do some freaky diet as well. And neither the chiro or naturopath is qualified to do any of that diagnosing and treatment. The chiro is just supposed to treat musculoskeletal disorders!!! \n\nAt any rate, I don\u2019t see any time or effort being spent on poor Joe. He sounds like such a sweet kid\u2026his immediate thought was to get your money back!!! This kid deserves a game. I wish I had the ability to get him access to meet the players or something. I really like what someone said about giving him a soft place to land when he goes to college, turns 18, or even now\u2026and following his lead and wishes. His mom SOLD his birthday gift behind his back for what I\u2019m betting is a bogus allergy test. I would be shocked if they didn\u2019t try and charge him rent once he graduated high school. I don\u2019t know if you live on a big area with a college, but I could also totally see them encouraging him to live at home but take out additional student loans (if he wants to go the college route) to help fund their lives, leaving him with the consequences and bills afterward. \n\nI would also encourage your sister and BIL to go to the biggest male hospital within their coverage network (if they aren\u2019t already) to get second or fiftieth opinions. Just based on the symptoms you shared she might need to see see neuro, endocrine, cardio, and allergy/immunology. And if she has complex health issues, she should also see a therapist.
