Throwaway because family uses Reddit.\n\nI am unmarried and do not have children so I don't understand this situation from a parent's standpoint. I have a niece, Kay 21, and a nephew, Joe 16. My sister and her husband have spent the last few years (since the pandemic started) trying to get Kay sorted. By that I mean she has a lot of unexplained ailments. They've been seeing specialists, chiropractors, acupuncture, etc. To this day I'm still not entirely sure what is wrong. Kay posts on social media a lot about feeling fatigued, having migraines, weakness, and other symptoms along with her various appointments. Personally I worry this is being driven by attention because it has become her entire personality.\n\nI try to help Kay when I can (I've taken her to a few appointments because she doesn't drive) but I've tried to be present mostly for Joe who is overshadowed by all of this. Joe is a very simple young man and doesn't ask for much but I can tell he wants some attention. He makes this known by pushing himself in sports, getting the best grades, getting a job, and trying to be as independent as possible. He's 16 but acts 20. It kind of sucks to watch.\n\nFor his birthday I bought two tickets to a football game and transferred them to my sister so that she or her husband could take him. I told them that if they absolutely couldn't then I would but they accepted the tickets. Fast forward a couple weeks later and I see a post from my sister selling two football game tickets and they were very quickly bought. I confronted her and said those tickets were for Joe. Her response was they needed help covering new allergy testing for Kay and that's what the money would be used for.\n\nI took Joe to lunch yesterday and asked him how he is really doing. He was honest and said he doesn't feel like an equal member of his family and I told him I see it too. I asked him why he agreed to sell his birthday tickets and learned he never did and never even knew anything about them. I told him the sequence of events. He was quiet for a bit and then sighed and accepted it. To my surprise he must have said something to his parents because they called me for a conversation, accusing me of being an AH and saying I hurt Joe's feelings and that he was better off not knowing.

You didn't hurt Joe's feelings. They did when they stole from him and lied to him. At some point we all get a clue about how imperfect our parents are and we respond to these imperfections accordingly. But that doesn't mean we shun our parents and walk away from them in disgust. (There are other outcomes after finding out you've been lied to and ripped off is my only point.)\n\nAt any rate, their attempt to make you the bad guy after their misdeeds were exposed really speaks to what kind of people they've become. Entitled, and lacking moral compass is not a good look. Tell them so.\n\nAnd remember that as kids get older, we can gift them directly. I'd never put something intended for one of their children into their hands again. They pretty much stole from Joe and you.", "you didn't hurt joes feelings they did when they stole from him - and I bet that isn't the first time and wont be the last, is there any way you could take joe in to give him the attention and encouragement that he so desperatly needs, I am sure he would even be happy with a fold down bed in the living room just to get him out of that toxic enviroment", "NTA but wow your sister and brother-in-law are next level AHs.\n\nBest you can do is spend as much time with Joe as you can.  Turn up for important sports things.  Do things just the two of you.  Just be there for him.\n\nMy heart goes out to Joe.

The best gift you can give him is a sanctuary where he can relax and not have the pressure of trying to get the love that his parents don't have to give.  \n\nYour nephew lives in a world where no matter how hard he tries, he will never ve good enough.  This might become his permanent perspective.  He may never feel like he's good enough in any relationship. \n\nAt 16, it may be too late to reverse the \"less than\" dynamic but, as a \"less than\", I can tell you that simply being noticed or thought of or listened to is huge.  \n\nSome of my fondest childhood memories are moments that seem insignificant to everyone else. It was so wonderful to be seen. To be noticed as something more than an annoyance was an amazing gift.\n\nYou let your nephew know you see him.  He will cherish that moment. Keep letting him know you see him.  Check up on him regularly. Take him to lunch, to games, and anything else he likes. You can't Undo the damage his parents have done and continue to do. But you can show him that there is a whole world that doesn\u2019t see him as less than.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t hurt Joe, his parents who clearly don\u2019t care much for him did. Don\u2019t give gifts to anyone but him directly going forward.

My brother's 2nd son was born with gastroschisis. He was in the hospital his first year. His first son was healthy and about a year older. He ended up being somewhat pushed to the side, though we showered him with love and affection. He developed a \"cough\" that he kind of still has (he's 18 now). I think it's because he needed attention and saw that his brother being sick got him attention. If I had given him a gift and my brother sold it, I'd be livid. I'd expect them to pay me back for it, just as you should.", "NTA\n\nAs I understand the concern for your sick kid - the parents have two kids.", "NTA - he should definitely know that someone tried to do something nice for him.

Share it with them. Encourage them to fix their focus before it's too late!", "NTA, but his parents are horrible people.  And you learned to never trust them with anything for Joe.  Never let them have access to anything that is for him again. They literally stole those tickets.   \n\nI personally would have lit them up on social media for that.  They should be shamed publicly for this and for only caring that he found out.  Those tickets were not theirs to sell.", "NTA. You\u2019ve just learned a valuable lesson. You can never gift anything physical to Joe from here until he\u2019s independent. Take him out for meals or events. Give him time and experiences, but anything tangible will be hawked before the charges finish clearing your bank account.", "NTA\nI guess it WOULD be easier for the parents for their kid not to know they stole from him. That is the goal of deception.\nI hope OP can help Joe build a support system that doesn't siphon off the resources justly due him to further make him the invisible child. His parents are worse than neglectful. They're straight up abusive.", "NTA. You purchased tickets and said one of them could go spend quality time with their SON, for his birthday at a football game. They did not tell Joe the truth and deliberately sold something that they did not buy with their OWN money, with the excuse of an allergy test (do they not have savings or health insurance). Stand up for yourself and let them know exactly how it is. I would also inform people of what had transpired and DEMAND that they pay you back for the tickets you bought. They are disgusting and I hope that Joe cuts them off. When that happens and they are stuck wondering why, no one should hold back from informing them about the truth.", "This especially the bank account thing. So the parents can't touch it.\n\nPart of me wants to say OP should just take the kid all together but thats unreasonable.", "I'm not sure what is in place for his money but you raise a good point.", "Don't ever give a gift for Joe to anyone but Joe.", ">But.... you know... it may not be that Kay is attention whoring. Her misery may be her whole personality because the condition of unknown etiology is making her miserable all the time.\n\nThis. Some chronic illnesses take a long time to diagnose because there aren't reliable tests for them. Working through a diagnosis of exclusion (ruling everything else out) is a long and exhausting process that drains your hope - and that's with a helpful doctor that believes you and doesn't just go \"I think you're depressed!\"\n\nAlso, when you're sick and isolated for a long time, you often find that you don't have anything to talk about except your health. Because that's literally the only thing that's happened to you recently. It sucks.\n\nPlease give Joe the attention and love he needs right now, but also, please don't doubt Kay just because she hasn't got a diagnosis yet and her parents are being assholes to Joe.", "Poor Joe is a Glass Child.", "I think my brother's kid was 10 when she told me to please not gift her money because her mom always just absorbed the gift into her bank account.

He knows this. His parents know this.", "Seriously., A police report?  They weren't stolen since he transferred them willingly to the parents.  They have the right to do anything with them at that point.  Yeah it sucks they sold then, but there is no criminal action here.", "I agree.

Gladly of course, but my hope was they would take the free opportunity.", "I think so too. Joe is too independent physically but not emotionally. He\u2019s still a teenager.
