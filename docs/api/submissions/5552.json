I\u2019ve been looking to buy a house for more than 2 years. I live in a very rural area, so there\u2019s not a lot of houses on the market, and said market is terribly competitive.\n\nSo. There was a house on the market that had everything I wanted. But it was quite expensive. I\u2019ll change up the numbers here, but let\u2019s say the seller was asking for 400 000$. The appraisal for the house (made by the town) was for around 295 000$.\n\nMy budget would not allow me to get a 400 000$ house. But I could have gone maybe around 315 000$ (again, numbers are changed, but I try to kept the ratios comparable). The house has been on the market for a few months now, so I tell myself that maybe they\u2019ll be willing to lower their prices.\n\nI visit the house, and I like it a lot. I make an offer through the realtor for 315 000$. After a while, realtor writes back (email) to tell me that the sellers made a counter-offer for 390 000$, and that this offer is pretty firm and that they won\u2019t go much lower. So I write back to tell her that I can\u2019t accept that counter-offer as it\u2019s too expansive. \n\nThough this would be the end of the story? I wished. This is where the poop hit the fan. So. Realtor sends me an email with a link for me to sign the counter-offer, saying that I do not accept it.\n\nI read through the thing before signing. As I read through, I see that the realtor made a huge mistake. They wrote that the counter-offer is 290 000$ (100 000$ less than the actual counter-offer). They wrote it in letters AND numbers, and that counter-offer is signed by the realtor AND the sellers.\n\nAnd that is where I think I was an asshole. After talking with a few people to get their opinions, the consensus was that the worst that could happen was that they would find a way to get out of it. (EDIT:  As I discussed with different people, many told me that realtors have insurance for situations like these. I checked with my country\u2019s realtor association, and it is the case. My understanding of that was that the insurance would cover the missing 100 00$ for the sellers) So I sign the counter offer, saying that I accept their 290 000$ counter-offer.\n\nThe realtor calls me in a panic, begging me to destroy this version of the contract and sign a modified one. I stay extremely polite and civil, but I stick to my guns and say that I signed for the 290 000$ one. I cried after that phone call. I really hated doing this to her, as it was a mistake, but everyone signed on it.\n\nIn the end, after asking colleagues and bosses, the realtor said that since that counter-offer is lower than the price I offered at first, it is inadmissible. So in the end it was all for nothing, and I was extremely shitty for making the realtor go through all of that. So, AITA for trying to get a house cheap?\n\n(EDIT 2 : Opinions from you wonderful people are mixed, but since many of you are confirming it was an asshole move, I just communicated with the realtor to apologize.)", "created_utc": 1671891746, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zuasn6/aita_for_trying_to_get_a_house_cheap/", "score": 194, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I agree with you that OP was trying to screw them.", "Like I said in another comment: if those people were actually going to be in a financial bind over this, then they would have actually read what they signed. I don't understand how OP is taking advantage by signing something someone else wrote up.", "How is it an \"obvious mistake\" though??? If it's in both numbers and text and isn't far off from their appraisal value?", "So why send them out?", "The OP is dead ass wrong about the \"appraisal\" \"by the town\", that's a tax assessment for tax purposes and does not determine actual value. If you can't wrap your head around this kind of stuff reality is gonna slap you down hard when you finally have to do adult things.", "Unless the OP was buying the house with cash, which it seems pretty clear wasn\u2019t the case, OP could not possibly be stiffed the way you describe. It is clear OP doesn\u2019t understand the difference between a tax assessment and an appraisal any better than you do, but in reality a bank will not mortgage a house for more than its appraised value. Towns don\u2019t appraise properties, banks that finance mortgages appraise them to determine if they are interested in financing the purchase. If the price is above the appraisal, OP would not be able to get a mortgage without making up the difference completely out of pocket with cash, which is generally inadvisable unless the buyer has cash to burn.", "First of all, a one time mistake doesn't need consequences. Everyone makes mistakes, and as long as we learn from them, that should be enough. Second, putting a 2 instead of a 3 is not a difficult mistake to make. Thirdly, the realtors don't deserve to lose that money either, just because of such a small mistake made by an employer. I don't care who's pocket she's taking from, it's shitty either way.", "BUT THIS FUCKING SUB IS ABOUT MORAL JUDGMENTS. The judgement should still be YTA. That's what the sub is for. Not arguing whether it's okay to be immoral because you need it.", "But you have no idea if they did inflate the numbers. You're making assumptions. Even if they were, the sellers being assholes wouldn't make OP suddenly not an asshole somehow. It would just mean there's more than one asshole, so your point is completely meaningless and doesn't discount anything I've said or effectively argue my point.", "I agree with your first sentence in general, and we have a serious housing crisis that extends well beyond one seller. But to your other point, we don't really have enough into to know if the sellers are greedy, or if they bought it for more and simply have a mortgage to pay off and are trying to get back what they paid. The appraisal price doesn't tell us the whole story.", "Then you clearly don't understand what the phrase taking advantage means. Taking advantage of a mistake isn't somehow not taking advantage.", "Under what circumstance would a seller counter with a value LESS than what the buyer already bid. There is also a paper trail indicating that the counter should have been $390k. \n\nI look forward to your response.", "Lady, this is unenforceable contract. It is voidable by the mistaken party, and I do not know why you think otherwise.\n\n\"As a general rule, when dealing with a unilateral mistake, if the non-mistaken party is aware of or should have been aware of the other party's mistake, it becomes a \u201cpalpable, unilateral mistake,\u201d making the contract voidable by the mistaken party.\"\n\nNo court of law is going to look at this case and force specific performance.", "It is basic black letter contract law that one learns the first week of law school when you learn the basic principles of contract formation.\n\nIf there is a mistake in the contract there was no meeting of the minds and no contract was formed.\n\nIf OP attempted to enforce the contract, a Judge wouldn't because they look to the \"four corners\" of a contract in order to figure out what was the intent of the parties. \n\nThey don't operate in a vacuum where they enforce every contract because it was was signed just as there are certain circumstances in which a court will find there was a contract or proceed as if there was a signed contract if it would be equitable to do so.\n\nAnd of course in terms of morality and decency, OP is a flaming asshole - that goes without saying.", "Because it can create a whole other headache if you send out other offers before the other person declines if they decide to actually accept it before the deadline if they haven't officially declined", "I...don't...care....", "It wasn't a one time mistake to be fair.\n\nBefore sending out such a contract it usually gets double checked so the realtor atleast had to miss it two times.\n\nAnd yes, if it's literally your job to sell other people's property you better get the price right, every single time. \n\nIt's not hard to proof read a contract.", "Fair point.", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistake_%28contract_law%29#%3A%7E%3Atext%3DIn_contract_law%2C_a_mistake%2Cbe_provided_by_the_courts.?wprov=sfla1\n\nThis seems to paint this as less black and white than you are implying.", "Yeah it's pretty obvious you don't care that you're wrong \ud83d\ude02", "It still doesn't make it okay. Even if it was coming directly out of the pocket of the realtor who made the mistake, OP would still be the asshole for taking advantage.", "I think you\u2019re confusing a tax assessment with an appraisal", "YTA\n\nI have no idea how the law works in the US, but where I live there has been several high profile cases where these sorts or errors occurred and people tried to take advantage of it. The judge always sided with scammed side, saying that it was obvious that there was a mistake so it wasn't a good faith decision and the contract was invalid.\n\nYTA as you knew it was a mistake.", "YTA but I\u2019m curious to know, if the shoe was on the other foot and you had been the one to make a mistake during the house buying purchase that would have cost you 100k wouldn\u2019t you feel sick to your stomach with anxiety and fear if the sellers or their realtor refused to back down?", "NTA.", "The $ goes before the number in the US.", "This is called a Scrivener\u2019s error. Correspondence clearly indicates the counter was supposed to be $390k and OP should and would *know* that was the intent. The courts would not enforce the contract at 290 and would allow the realtor and seller to correct their mistake. \n\nOP, you\u2019re an AH for trying to take advantage of a situation you obviously knew was not correct. How would you feel if the shoe was on the other foot?", "You know, if OP had been honest, and said \u201chey, this form says X, are you sure about this?\u201d The owners might have lowered the price a bit for honesty.", "Yes! That's what stood out to me. Unless they live in a very weird place, the town wouldn't be doing an appraisal.", "OP would be best off getting legal advice from someone qualified (lawyer in her/the house's jurisdiction).\n\nShe has a signed offer and that's enough to make a headache for someone. As for if it was a mistake, a lawyer would probably question that. House has been on the market for months and the \"mistake\" was for selling it for it's appraisal value. Seems like you could argue if it was a mistake.", "Yeah, except that's not the situation.  The town didn't make an appraisal for the market value of the house, the town makes an assessment for tax purposes.  The market value of a house is completely different.", "Are you a lawyer? \n\nWhat are you relying on in terms of there being ambiguity sufficient to make the contract enforceable.\n\nThis kind of mistake would not be enforceable it is so obvious that there is a major error. OP realized that as soon as he read the contract but thought he could cheat the seller.\n\nJudges have discretion in interpreting \"black letter\" law principles and so in this specific case they would void the contract because enforcement would be inequitable and the mistake was obvious.", "YTA. You \"tried to get a house cheap\" by signing an unenforceable contract. Contracts are only valid if they document a meeting of the minds. You knew the actual counteroffer was for $390k, not $290k. There was no chance you would get the house for $290k. That was wishful thinking on your part.\n\nIf, instead, you signed the counteroffer to teach the realtor a lesson about the need to be more careful, I would have said NTA. But you were literally trying to steal $100k from someone.", "NTA they all know how to read and write.", "Well I bet the realtor will never make that mistake again. Remember ppl. Read everything, don't just sign paper ppl give you", "YTA!", "This was your chance to get the house for the price of your original offer  \n\n\nIf you'd suggested $315,000 again, they'd have agreed, just to get out of the situation", "The county appraisal is always going to be different than the market price. You can't afford the house and lowballed, then tried to take advantage of a mistake.

These would give an out", "There is, this works almost assuredly be voided as Scrivener's error since there is other correspondence stating $390k.", "Perhaps you can explain this to me as I'm confused, the realtor sent OP something to sign to indicate that OP denied the counter-offer, right?  Is it a check yes if you accept the counter-offer, check no if you don't?  I've never bought a house, so I'm confused how they turned a document signaling their denial into an acceptance.", "Yes, there are typically 3 boxes: accept, decline or counter the counter offer.", "Still waiting for that explanation on how this isn\u2019t an obvious mistake :)"]}
