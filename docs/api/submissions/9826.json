Your father is demonstrating very unhealthy and sexist behavior.\n\nUnfortunately, some of these things are likely to be considered legally allowable from a parent, but it is important that you recognize that you are NOT a lesser person than your brother, no matter what your father says.\n\nIt is also important you have someone outside the home you can talk to (and do talk to them about what is going on in your home) who can intervene if and when your father's behavior crosses the legal line and/or threatens your health or safety.", "NTA. Is there another adult in your life you can talk to about this? An aunt or uncle, maybe a teacher or a friends parent? This isn\u2019t okay, he shouldn\u2019t be treating you like this.", "NTA. Your father is entirely ignorant and a misogynist. You can do anything you still feel physically capable of whilst on your period, and this business of you eating after them is just awful.\n\nOP I\u2019m so sorry that this is the situation you\u2019re in. You deserve equal levels of respect to your brother.", "Definitely nta. Your father's sexism is showing badly.. I don't know your culture. But you should be able to eat at the same time as them and there is no good reason why you brother can't play with you anymore. I had a lot of fun with my brothers when I was younger! And I don't get why you aren't allowed to game anymore? There are women that game.\n\nCan you stay with some other family members instead? As I don't see this getting better unfortunately.", "NTA.\n\nBefore I get to all the reasons why, I just want to implore you to talk to an adult you trust about these things, preferably a woman. Perhaps an aunt or a teacher, maybe the school counselor. If none of that is available to you, then I would urge you to contact Child Protective Services (CPS) or the Department of Family and Child Services (DCFS) or whatever organization exists where you live. Your father\u2019s behavior is already very alarming and has the potential to get much worse.\n\nYour father is absolutely in the wrong. No 13yo should be tasked with the responsibility of cooking for and cleaning up after her parents and siblings. You\u2019re a child, and he\u2019s the adult. Attending to the necessities of daily life is his job, not yours. However, him making you wait for them to finish eating so you can wash their dishes before you eat\u2026 that\u2019s disturbing and frankly cruel. He is indoctrinating and conditioning both you and your brother with sexist and misogynistic philosophies about the role of women and girls as subservient to the men in their lives. You are not a servant. Your life is not about performing thankless labor for the benefit of men- family or otherwise- and being punished with cold dinner for your efforts.\n\nAs I said above, I really think you need to talk to an adult you trust about this. What your father is doing is deeply abusive, and the sooner you get to experience life outside of his sphere of influence, the better.", "NTA at all. This is abusive behaviour and no culture can be justified to treat anyone like this. Please tell someone at school about this.", "Sorry, but your dad doesn't sound kind or nice. I'm sorry that he's using the excuse of culture and tradition to not include you as much as before in family life. You are NTA. \n\nI wish I could suggest some things that could help, but it's really difficult when you're still a minor. If there's a sympathetic teacher or friend's mother that you know you can trust who you could talk to about this, it might be a good idea. Otherwise I can only suggest to do as well as you can at school and try to make opportunities for yourself to go on and study in order to find a life that doesn't involve serving men.", "This is called parentification and is a form of child abuse. You, as a 13yo, caring for your fathers needs before your own is a problem. \n\nHe is also putting you into a weird role due to your gender. \n\nYou have little rights here, so tread carefully. Do your research, know what\u2019s what, but don\u2019t bring it up with your father unless and until you either have an exit strategy or an advocate, because he can and might take your computer and other tools you might need to get any opinion or help outside your own small circle of community. \n\nThis issue might seem small, but it\u2019s indicative of larger issues to come and possible loss of autonomy. I wish you the best of luck. \n\nRemember to clear your browser history and delete traces.", "NTA your dad is incredibly sexist and is making your brother one too. Please seek trustworthy female adults in your life for help. Your family basically isolating you and seeing you as second because you're a woman is very much a form of abuse.", "NTA. This is not only sexist but abusive. Denying you food until after they've eaten? And they make you cook most of the time? That's terrible. And what does playing with a game console have to do with gender?? I'd consider moving out as soon as you're old enough and able to do so.", "NTA. Your dad\u2019s patriarchal bullshit will be very beneficial to him and your brother but not you. You deserve better. To treat you as lesser because you are a woman is super screwed up. To expect you to agree that makes sense is a whole different level of psychological abuse", "NTA. Just go sit at the table. Your period isn't going to poison his food. If it's bothering him so much then he can eat after you to honour you and your new womanhood \ud83d\ude44", "NTA. Not only is this sexist, in my opinion, it\u2019s borderline neglect making you wait to eat until after them. Not to mention, it\u2019s degrading and demeaning. I hope you have someone you trust you can talk to. And clearly your dad KNOWS he is wrong or he wouldn\u2019t have gotten upset that you looked it up.", "That is not right, it's completely unacceptable and mentally abusive. Look for other family members to live with. Tell a teacher, tell anyone that might care. Your dad sounds like a fasist AH and I'm unsure how he gets away with opinions like that in 2023.", "NTA, your father is a misogynist", "NTA. He is sexist and probably thinks women are inferior to him and your brother. Please don't let yourself be fooled. As time goes on, he will probably be more and more restrictive, but don't believe for a second you are less than your brother.", "NTA.\n\nI'm so sorry but your father's misogyny is abusive.  And it's clear that not everyone in his home country treats women this way, as it's different in your aunt and uncle's family.\n\nPlease, please talk with your aunt and uncle, and with your school counselor. \n\nIf you could live with your aunt and uncle, I think this would be much, much better for you.  Would they agree to this?  If so, under the circumstances you describe, I suspect that family court (at least in the U.S.) would be willing to change your custody if your dad objected.\n\nIf your father wouldn't hit you or hurt you physically, you might want to see what happens if you start eating at the table with him and your brother.  Just sit down and serve yourself.  And also what would happen if you were to use whatever electronic device you like?  \n\nYou can tell him, \"We're in America \\[or wherever\\] now, and here women are equal. I'm equal, and I deserve to be treated as an equal.\"\n\nIf doing this would put you at risk, of course, don't do it.  \n\nI", "100% NTA.  \n\nI\u2019m glad that you are sensing, even at your young age, that something is off here. \n\nI guess your father is trying to enact some old culture where women are second class because they\u2019re \u201cdirty\u201d with the period. That\u2019s not how we do things these days, and it\u2019s not really okay by our standards.  \n\nYou\u2019re a full-on person just like them. I know you already sense this, but I want to confirm for you that it isn\u2019t right to put burdens on you that the rest of the family don\u2019t have to carry.  \n\nI wish I could give you more guidance, but all I have is my reflection. That must feel so demeaning and isolating to you. It\u2019s horrible that you\u2019re treated like some kind of abject thing, not allowed to indulge in the comforts of the home, not allowed to play video games! Not allowed to eat with the family, to eat hot food before it gets cold, to eat the meal you helped prepare! It\u2019s awful!  \n\nAnd to encounter that when you\u2019re so young, when you\u2019re developing your sense of place in the world.  \n\nI will say this: Your father said to only use the internet for school questions, and yet you came here to ask. That was very brave and very wise of you, to disobey that ridiculous command from him.  \n\nHere is another piece of internet content that I think you would like: an interview with a woman who is fighting such double standards. When I heard this interview I was touched in my heart, excited and invigorated and inspired to hear the strength in her voice. And it just crushed me to hear the culture that she describes, the life she describes women living. Just as it crushes me to hear about your situation.  \n\nGod I\u2019m so sorry. Please do not stop seeking input from outside your home. Please do not lose that perspective, that doubt you feel about the culture you\u2019re being sewn into.  \n\nYou did the right thing coming to us to ask. You are right to feel that something is wrong because something is seriously wrong in your home. Even if he\u2019s simply trying to follow some tradition that he learned, he\u2019s still wrong to follow it so blindly, to put that tradition above his own daughter\u2019s dignity and not to step back and say \u201cwtf am I doing??\u201d.   \n\nHere is the interview: https://youtu.be/l5hUqXKc_uU\n\n(When it starts playing ads for this thing called \u201cExodous\u201d just skip forward through it. Unfortunately the video starts with one of those. The part of the video that\u2019s good is the interview itself).  \n\nStay strong girl!
