But I do expect atleast a wish and dinner for special occasions like anniversary or bday. \n\nThis year on our anniversary a week before I picked a place where we would go for dinner. That morning he woke up in a bad mood and was annoyed with me for something petty, I realised he doesn\u2019t remember so I let it be, I called him at work but he was busy in a meeting and he did not remember the whole day and at night when his mom called to wish us he realised it\u2019s our anniversary. \n\nNext came my bday. He forgot it\u2019s my bday. He came home from work and looked at the flowers my boss had sent me and asked me about it for which I gave some random reason  and did not remember it until post dinner until someone wished me in the common group. He apologised for not remembering it and promised we will go out for dinner next day.. it got pushed to weekend and weekend he took me to the same place we go every weekend when we are bored to cook food. I was so over dressed. \ud83d\ude01.  \n\nThis is where I might be petty but this time I thought maybe I am feeling bad cos I plan and surprise so much and maybe have started expecting it in return and I should keep it simple like he does. So I didn\u2019t plan anything for his bday which is in a week. However he is constantly reminding me that it\u2019s his bday and has asked me to take the day off from work as he wants us to go to the best restaurant and have a fun bday.

You can only give so much.", "NTA because he makes zero effort for your birthday or anniversary.  If I was you I'd definitely work on his birthday and not buy a card or present.

And then on the day, he'd forgotten.\n\nI did exactly the same for him that final year I was with him, and he hit the ROOF. He was practically crying, telling me he felt so neglected and unloved. All I said was, \"Do you know, I know just how that feels,\" but the lack of respect and reciprocity was deeper-seated than just my birthday. We didn't last much longer. \n\nWe weren't in the right income group or... 'culture', I'd guess I'd call it... for therapy. I'm going back many years and lived in working-class northern England, where therapy was seen as for posh people with too much time and money on their hands. \n\nSo, NTA for not wanting to.

Probably purchased in the grocery store checkout line. I went on strike about 3 years ago and do virtually nothing for him. I cook and clean for myself and have a housekeeper do the house. However, if I cook something for myself and there is enough for him, he can have some. After 30 years, I am matching his energy and am so much happier.

Talk about how you guys do and dont celebrate special occasions that involve you and all the ways you feel under apperciated.\n\n\nOr\n\n\n\nYou could take the day off and tell him that you guys are going to do a joint birthday celebration to make up for your shirty one from him and plan a day you both will enjoy.\n\n\n\nNTA", "It sounds like he brings up that his birthday is coming up and tells you what he wants.

He sucks for not having a calendar reminder and treating you like that. You shouldn't have let these issues pile up and communicated the wrongs done to you in the moment. Celebrating with him should happen because you want to not because it's expected, but if you withhold celebration from him when he's directly communicated with you, it seems like revenge and unhealthy.

That's it. That's all it takes to make me happy. So all day I was just waiting for him to say \"Happy Birthday!\". When he didn't say it right when we got up and throughout the day I thought maybe he was going to surprise me with something, so was holding out. I couldn't conceive of him forgetting my birthday. No way.\n\nNope. When he finally went to bed I was devestated. He REALLY forgot my birthday. Needless to say, the next day I was super quiet, sad and gloomy (he still hadn't remembered). He asked me if something was wrong and I'm like \"What day is tomorrow?\" Him \"My birthday\". Still no click. Me, \"What day was yesterday?\" Thinking, this has got to do it. Him \"Sunday\". Jesus fucking Christ. Me \"What was yesterday's date?\". Him \"the 21st\".  \n\nI'm staring at him and he seemed confused why I was looking at him so intentlty. At LEAST 30 Seconds of silence before his eyes go wide and he blurts \"OH SHIT!\". Yeah dumbass, oh shit is right.

Or that he just chose to not say/do anything, thinking birthdays aren't a big deal to me anyways. \n\nHis brain clearly just decided to go on the fritz. He's never forgotten again :). Given it's the only time in 22 years, I now find it funny; for the sheer fact of our birthdays being so close together.

She was rightfully pissed off the entire day, but never said a thing to me about why.  I didn\u2019t remember until the next day.  It took a while for her to get over that one.  Rightfully so.  I was embarrassed and upset that I hurt her by forgetting.\n\nPut her birthday in my Samsung cell phone calendar.  Every year, it reminded me two days before. Worked great.  \n\nUntil the phone broke.  Got an Apple phone.  Transferred the data on the Samsung.  Unknown to me, my wife\u2019s birthday calendar reminder didn\u2019t transfer and I forgot it was there. \n\nNext birthday, no reminder.  I forgot again.

(The deal was in a southern state where snow is rare.) No one could reach the people from the title company there, the seller was pissed and threatening to call the whole thing off. Multi-million dollar deal. It took a lot of phone calls and, like, soothing reassuring words to different parties to make everyone calm the eff down and go through with it.\n\nIf you have a day like that at work, it is very easy to forget that it's Valentine's Day. You may have to stay late. You can have a calendar reminder that goes off but not register it because so much else is going on, or you're on your desk phone not your cell.\n\nIf someone forgot my birthday but everything else in the relationship was good I would not give a fuck. I am usually the one who forgets birthdays, it's not intentional. I'm just not good remembering dates. Not just birthdays/anniversaries.

He's the kind of person who forgets things, so he gives people reminders. She doesn't remind him - when he woke up on their anniversary and had clearly forgotten, she didn't give him a heads-up. So she knows this is who he is. HE knows this is who he is.

I'm not sure why no one here will listen? Some people are not good at this stuff. It doesn't make them bad people. It doesn't mean they don't value their partner. It means they're bad at remembering dates. It's such a small thing. It's not cheating. It's not theft. It's not a gambling addiction that's ruining their family. Not everyone is going to set up 2 calendars, for some of us 2 calendars would be worse than one.\n\nNot everyone is like you or OP.
