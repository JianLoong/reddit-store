But I do expect atleast a wish and dinner for special occasions like anniversary or bday. \n\nThis year on our anniversary a week before I picked a place where we would go for dinner. That morning he woke up in a bad mood and was annoyed with me for something petty, I realised he doesn\u2019t remember so I let it be, I called him at work but he was busy in a meeting and he did not remember the whole day and at night when his mom called to wish us he realised it\u2019s our anniversary. \n\nNext came my bday. He forgot it\u2019s my bday. He came home from work and looked at the flowers my boss had sent me and asked me about it for which I gave some random reason  and did not remember it until post dinner until someone wished me in the common group. He apologised for not remembering it and promised we will go out for dinner next day.. it got pushed to weekend and weekend he took me to the same place we go every weekend when we are bored to cook food. I was so over dressed. \ud83d\ude01.  \n\nThis is where I might be petty but this time I thought maybe I am feeling bad cos I plan and surprise so much and maybe have started expecting it in return and I should keep it simple like he does. So I didn\u2019t plan anything for his bday which is in a week. However he is constantly reminding me that it\u2019s his bday and has asked me to take the day off from work as he wants us to go to the best restaurant and have a fun bday. Am now I am wondering why does he get to have special days when I never do.

Frankly, I\u2019m tired of putting in the effort to celebrate you when you can\u2019t even be bothered to remember my birthday until a friend wishes me happy birthday. While I know you\u2019ve always been this way, I guess I\u2019ve just grown resentful and really dislike how you take me for granted. So, no. This year your birthday is getting the exact same amount of attention as my birthday: none.\u201d", "NTA. Sorry, but your husband is a selfish jerk.", "Nope, NTA.  Maybe he needs a dose of his own medicine to know what it *feels* like.", "NTA sounds like he's very comfortable taking you for granted. It's time for a come to jesus moment about how he sees you and what your expectations are for one another.", "NTA 11 years. ELEVEN years. Good lord. \n\n*there weren\u2019t any signs of her leaving me*  \n\nThis is your disassociation moment. The part that turns into the point of no return. There\u2019s NO excuse for him to not acknowledge you after 11 years. You deserve to be appreciated by those that love you. You don\u2019t even ask for much, honestly. You can only give so much.", "NTA because he makes zero effort for your birthday or anniversary.  If I was you I'd definitely work on his birthday and not buy a card or present.  But I'm petty like that.", "NTA. I had a partner like this, too. Any number of reminders went unheeded - in fact, if I said it more than twice (like, \"Don't forget, we're going to X for my birthday on Wednesday\",) he'd get frustrated and tell me to stop angling for a present. And then on the day, he'd forgotten.\n\nI did exactly the same for him that final year I was with him, and he hit the ROOF. He was practically crying, telling me he felt so neglected and unloved. All I said was, \"Do you know, I know just how that feels,\" but the lack of respect and reciprocity was deeper-seated than just my birthday. We didn't last much longer. \n\nWe weren't in the right income group or... 'culture', I'd guess I'd call it... for therapy. I'm going back many years and lived in working-class northern England, where therapy was seen as for posh people with too much time and money on their hands. \n\nSo, NTA for not wanting to. However, get thee to some kind of counselling if you still want to stay with him. Obviously, you didn't say what he's like the rest of the time, so have a think.", "Being petty is my first thought process but as someone looking to marry their partner it's not always an option. Before his birthday comes sit him down, \"I won't be planning anything this year for you. You've hurt me by forgetting any and all significant dates. It's not fair I take off work for your birthday and you forgot mine.\" Sometimes you just have to let the inner monologue be heard and base how you handle things on their reaction.", "NTA if you've expressed how hurt you have been over his lack of effort, before.  Your reaction is to me, normal.. After 11 years of putting in thought and effort, to not have it reciprocated would weigh on me as well.  At the end of the day, we all want to be valued and appreciated by our SO's, especially on birthday's and anniversaries.\n\nI would have an honest conversation about how this makes you feel..  Good luck.", "NTA I am a firm believer in matching energy. My man finds greeting cards that are strangely void of sentiment. Less than what you would give to a coworker. They are so wierd, I am pretty sure he has to go to multiple stores to find them. His gifts are usually gift cards to stores where I don\u2019t shop. Probably purchased in the grocery store checkout line. I went on strike about 3 years ago and do virtually nothing for him. I cook and clean for myself and have a housekeeper do the house. However, if I cook something for myself and there is enough for him, he can have some. After 30 years, I am matching his energy and am so much happier. He doesn\u2019t dare complain because he knows I would be better off without his lazy, non-reciprocal ass.", "NTA and also please remember that you do not have to stay married to him", "NTA.

You need to have a sit down talk and tell him no evading the questions or becoming defensive.", "NTA. I thought he may be the type of guy that just doesn't care about birthdays...but he does...his...what a tool.", "NTA and also why is a grown ass man so excited about his birthday that he feels the need to constantly remind everyone of it?", "He didn't remember your anniversary when you gave the thoughtful anniversary gift you picked out for him?

In the sense \u00abi didn't have a birthday so you won't get a birthday either\u00bb. I don't beleive this will be of any help.   \nDon't plan anything. If he organize something, come with him, but let him deal with everything and remind him that you didn't get to have your own birthday and you don't feel valued. Couples therapy maybe? Therapists can be good to validate your feelings.  \n\n\nHe is the A\\*\\*hole of course for forgetting your birthday. This should not be accepted and be carefull of other signs of \u00abcarelessness\u00bb. You do not deserve to be surrounded by people who do not care for you.", "You set the precedent. You allowed this dynamic.\n\n\n\nIf you do not have a very real honest discussion with him and just blow off his birthday you would be T A.\n\n\n\nMy suggestion is to not take off work. Go to dinner with him and use that time as an  opportunity to discuss all the things wrong with the relationship. Really deep dive into it.  Talk about how you guys do and dont celebrate special occasions that involve you and all the ways you feel under apperciated.\n\n\nOr\n\n\n\nYou could take the day off and tell him that you guys are going to do a joint birthday celebration to make up for your shirty one from him and plan a day you both will enjoy.\n\n\n\nNTA", "It sounds like he brings up that his birthday is coming up and tells you what he wants. Have you tried doing the same about dates important to you?", "ESH, This is a communication issue. You have expectations, is he aware of them?", "ESH. Sounds like he makes it clear his birthday is approaching and wants to do something. Where as you don\u2019t say a word and then lie when he questions why there\u2019s flowers. I don\u2019t know he doesn\u2019t remember things especially in this day and age with so many ways to be reminded", "ESH.  Use your words.  Do you see how he is using his words, reminding you it is his birthday, asking you to take the day off to spend with him, he even picked the restaurant.  You expect him to remember without a reminder.  You are testing him which isn\u2019t really an adult behavior nor fair to the victim as people usually get warned about upcoming tests.  You could have solved some of this by adding it having him add these dates to the calendar.", "Um, cos he\u2019s told you what he wants? If you want to go to a specific restaurant say \u201cit\u2019s my birthday Friday I\u2019ve booked x nice place\u201d as that\u2019s what he\u2019s done?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He just doesn't care about you as muhc as you think he might. Him \"not being very romantic\" or not wanting to celebrate is just him not wanting to do anything for you since he expects something for his birthday.

But completely forgetting your birthday and anniversary is something else, even if he was grumpy about something (anniversary) or distracted or busy.   \n\n\nIs this part of a pattern, has this happened in previous years?

Yes, hubby is thoughtless. I am by no means an ideal husband, but remembering my wife's birthday and our anniversary is hardly a challenge. If he is functionally intelligent enough to hold down a job, drive etc then he can remember two more dates. (Apparently he recalls his own birthday fine).\n\nBUT, I damn well hate being secretly tested and set up to fail. It makes me really angry. And that's what I'm hearing here. So if wife sits quietly seething, waiting for him to let her down, again, then what has she achieved?

In the days approaching some important thing \u2013 my mother's or brother's or father's birthday, my parents' anniversary, etc. \u2013 I will often think, 'oh, X day is next week/in 3 days/tomorrow', but when the actual day arrives, it won't occurr to me that it is X day; then, the day after X, I will suddenly remember, 'shit, yesterday was X day!'\n\nTo be fair, this is precisely why I set calendar reminders for things like this, which is obviously something OP's husband should have done, but it really isn't beyond belief that someone could forget a spouse's birthday after 11 years together.", "Have asked him to leave so many times. I built this house. I am not leaving.", "He stepped up to do his own laundry, cooking and grocery shopping. He does and never has done a single thing for me.
