Him holding you to a higher standard of parenting than he holds himself to is unfair and hypocritical.\n\nYWBTA if you don't sit down and talk to your son about alcohol as a coping mechanism, though. If he starts using it more and more as a way to self medicate, it won't end well, trust me on this one. I turned to alcohol as medication in my late teens due to trauma and other issues. It took me a while to shake it. I would strongly suggest, if it's possible for you, to get him into grief counseling. Full grown adults have trouble handling losing a child, a 17 year old will be at a great disadvantage.", "NAH. You didn't stop your son for the exact same reason your husband didn't say anything in the moment. It may not seem like it, but you actually pretty much agree with each other. (That said, I am very close to turning this into Not The Ass on the basis that your husband is trying to make it your fault - I'm currently thinking that this is his grief speaking, trying to make something into someone's fault so he has a reason to be angry...but if he doesn't apologise for that when you point this out, then he will be TA.)\n\nIt *isn't* a good habit to get into, but a one-off incident isn't a habit. Also, your child is hurting badly and then wasn't the time to scold him for something so minor.\n\nWhen a few days have passed, make sure you're keeping on communicating with your son about his grief, and that you're a safe place for him to express what he feels. See if you and your husband can come up with some alternate coping mechanisms and positive ways of expressing his grief. And then you can do your parenting thing and have a talk with your son about how he was feeling the day of the funeral, and did he feel the beer helped (hopefully not!) and why \"drowning your sorrows\" doesn't really work.\n\nBut the most important thing here is, as a family (as a pair of families together with your son's girlfriend's family), to give each other some grace right now. Pull together, check in with each other, and support each other with love; don't let yourselves fall into blame and pointing fingers. It's a tragedy, and you are all hurting so badly, and I'm so very sorry for your loss.", "I wouldn\u2019t have issue with you allowing your 17yo a drink at a social gathering or celebration, but as an emotional coping mechanism is very disturbing.", "NTA. \n\nYour son has suffered a very adult loss. Having a drink or two isn\u2019t going to hurt. I can understand that your husband is worried about your son continuing to use alcohol to cope, but he should be having that conversation with your son, not yelling at you.", "This. He has a problem with it, but wants mom to do what he himself was unwilling to do. Why is she being held to a higher standard of parenting by him than he holds himself to?", "Completely agree.  I also think there's something about the 'forbidden' aspect that creates alcoholic behaviors (hiding it, bingeing, etc).  As an American, I don't know a single person that *didn't* drink before 21.  \n\nLearning to drink normally (i.e. one or two drinks) with parental supervision is an advantage I wish I'd had growing up -- instead of learning about drinking from skeevy parties with other 16-year-olds, which we then had to hide from our parents.", "If this continues, then obviously you need to have a serious chat.", "Yeah, that not illegal where I live as long as they stay on the property and don't cause trouble.  If they cause some sort of ruckus, then I'd been responsible for it.\n\nI don't let my kids drink. My oldest is almost 12, but when one of us drinks, we invite them to smell it. I'll probably let my oldest start sipping alcohol soon. \n\nThere's lots of alcohol laden teen parties around here, so I intend to make alcohol as boring as possible. The friends I had whose parents made alcohol forbidden all went to those parties a lot, but the kids whose parents were like mine hardly ever went.", "Thank you so much, I appreciate it. <3", "I don't think it's illegal here, no.", "This", "I came here to say THIS!!!", "Fucking hell he had a drink once after his kid died.
