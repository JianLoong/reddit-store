Grief comes in waves, so he will feel this kind of pain again and again until it gets better. He shouldn't feel free to trink his grief away. \n\nBut also your son is 17. In most European countries, teenagers are allowed to drink beer at the age of 16 because a 16 can be responsible with beer. So I don't think it's so bad to let a 17yo father have a drink after the child's funeral. If he can be responsible with how often and how much he drinks, I think he should be trusted.\n\nSo I see both points of view. And no one is right or wrong imo.", "NAH, assuming you're American in many states this is legal. I do think that your partner has a fair concern about the use of substances as a coping mechanism, but it went off incident isn't going to cost that. I don't think I would apologize, but maybe reassure him that you don't have to miss to be an ongoing thing assuming that is the case. And maybe keep an eye on the alcohol in your house and make plans together on how to help your son get support besides a drink.", "NTA chances are slim this is what gets him addicted. Addiction is a disease if he's vulnerable to it it'll happen sooner or later. Might as well have him start safely at home instead of in a dark alley.", "You are most definitely NTA. Yes your son was only 17 however, he just lost his child due to very sad circumstances. You sat with him, so it's not like he went to his room with 2 cases of beer and hid and drank with no supervision. You were there for him when he needed someone to lean on. His dad is the ahole here for sure", "NTA in anyway. But some advice from someone who has experienced late term pregnancy loss and has undergone a lot of counseling and therapy. The whole being a \u201csolid rock to lean on\u201d thing is actually very isolating for the girlfriend. I\u2019m glad she has someone to lean on but all of the counselors and therapists have stressed the point that it can make the mother feel very alone is their grief. Grief is already to isolating, it\u2019s okay if he expresses that he is also struggling with the loss. I\u2019d also highly recommend a book called \u201cit\u2019s okay that your not okay\u201d by Megan Devine, it was the only thing that helped me understand my feelings when I was at my lowest point. I am so sorry this happened to your family, I know how hard it is \ud83d\udc95", "NTA\n\nI've lost a child in my 30s and my entire world crashed down around me. At 17, my god, my heart - now is not the time for anyone to be having a go at him for having a few beers.  And in any case he wasn't getting drunk he was sitting on the sofa, having a beer and being comforted by you.  \n\nThis is very much your husband's problem and I do hope that your son and of course you as well, can find your ways through this absolutely horrendous time.  I'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA\n\nYou made a judgement call as a concerned mother for your grieving son.  In the UK that would be legal anyway.  It\u2019s mad that you can bring a child into the world but not be trusted to have a beer\u2026", "Good Lord no, NTA. Your son experienced a very adult loss, and is experiencing adult pain. In other countries, the drinking age is 16-18. In most states, including mine, there are laws that allow for people under 21 to drink at home with parental supervision. You didn't let him go get trashed at a bar or with friends, you let him work through his pain at home in your own care. Your husband may be worried about addiction, but as long as your son isn't drinking daily, there's nothing to worry about at all.\n\n My mom let me have a decent sized shot of fireball at 16, after I lost a close friend to a purposeful opium/heroin overdose (he was only 16). She told me that normally she'd never allow such a thing, but I was in the fetal position in tears for hours after his funeral and she couldn't stand to see me like that. At his funeral, my friend's mom laid beside his coffin screaming and begging for him to come back. Saying she was sorry over and over and over again. His dad and brother had to lift her up and drag her away to calm her down, she was wailing in the worst way imaginable. It was absolutely the worst thing I've ever personally experienced, even 11 years later it makes me cry like a baby. I knew he had some issues, but I didn't even know Christian used or was severely depressed. Let alone enough to leave a note and choose to end his life. That one shot my mom let me have had me laughing again, and telling her about all the funny church and band stories I had with this kid.", "Sorry for all of your loss. \ud83d\udc90\n\nNTA. He\u2019s not far from 18 and then he can drink anyway. (Unless your in the US) but honestly this is what everyone does after a funeral. His age has nothing to do with it. The only reason children shouldn\u2019t drink is because of the lack of ability to cope with it and their developing brains. Your husband is overreacting, why isn\u2019t he allowed an occasional drink at this age anyway? As soon as he\u2019s legal, he\u2019ll go crazy if he\u2019s been kept away from it.", "NAH I\u2019m so sorry for your family\u2019s loss. I agree w another poster: if he\u2019s old enough to lose a child, he\u2019s old enough for a drink. I also agree w the person who said your husband should be more worried about your son being stoic. I suggest one of you take him out to do something nice for himself, golf or soccer or a book store or a movie, and give him space to be sad", "NAH - I understand letting your son have a beer, but it's not great. You should talk to your husband and acknowledge his concerns. Together you should talk to your son about not using alcohol to hide from grief. Once someone starts drinking this way, it can become a habit. At your son's age, no matter how well he's behaving, he likely hasn't developed better coping mechanisms and you don't want him to keep turning to alcohol. A one-time, day-of-funeral may be acceptable, but you have to have the discussion. Consider encouraging him to get grief counseling. I'm so sorry for your loss.", "NAH. Technically, your husband has a point. Technically, you have a point. Technically, your 17 year old had a point. \n\nI think the best suggestion moving forward is to go to your husband and say something like \"I'm sorry, I didn't consider your point of view. I don't think our discussion of this should be an argument, though. Can we talk about it again, with our son included, so we can make sure all three of us end up on the same page?\" \n\nAddiction always starts with one dose. But not everyone who has one dose gets addicted. Not every coping mechanism works for every grieving person and some try many things before settling. It's not weird that he wanted to try that one. It also doesn't guarantee he'll be addicted. But he could potentially. The best armor to protect himself from addiction and other unhealthy copes, is awareness. Not forbidding him from even touching something. \n\nMaybe talk to him about therapy, offer your unswerving emotional support, ask him what he thinks he needs right now, and what you can do to help him find a healthy way to go on.", "If your son is mature enough to have a kid, he is mature enough to have a drink.  \n\nObviously watch if he does this alot.\n\nDoes your husband really think a 17 year old hasn't had a drink before?", "NAH\n\nTwo beers is not drowning your sorrows. \n\nYour husband has a point. \n\nDrinking in my family was always allowed from young teen years on. We could try adult beverages and had wine with thanksgiving dinner etc. But it was always monitored and not an everyday thing. \n\nI've never felt the need to drown my sorrows or cope with alcohol, but I certainly would have a drink or two in such a situation. \n\nHowever I always pounded it into my kids heads that you never drink to forget or because you're stressed. Only ever drink to celebrate, when you're in a good mood etc. \n\nAlcohol is a downer and will compound feelings of depression or anger etc. \n\nI believe not \"parenting\" him at the time was the best choice for you. You know your child, and if it's not typical for him, then likely it's not a concern. If he starts going for that beer regularly during this time, then sit him down and have a heart to heart. \n\nIf your husband is concerned he has every right to have the conversation with his son about his concerns. Just ask him to please do it calmly and with an open mind at this time, and not in dictator mode.", "> But I've been thinking about it and I'm considering maybe I was in the wrong, and owe my husband (who is still somewhat upset about it) an apology. AITA?\n\nYou don't owe him an apology.  You might remind him that *he* refused to parent his child at the time.  Given that, he's out of line to criticize you for handling it differently than he thinks you should have.", "What can\u2019t dad be a big boy and say something himself? Why is he making you do it.

I think you are NTA, if your son starts binge drinking obviously do something but a couple drinks after something that horrible happens is fine", "NTA\n\nYour husband is such a hypocrite for being there while this is happening, not saying anything, but then telling you off for doing the exact same thing as him. He can get right off that high horse of his.\n\nI sincerely hope he's not one of those men who refuses to do any parenting but shames his wife for not living up to his exacting standards. If he disagreed with your sons choice, he could have spoken up himself. It's not just your job, it's his too.\n\nBut come on. A one off after his child's funeral is fine.
