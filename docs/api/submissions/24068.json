In most European countries, teenagers are allowed to drink beer at the age of 16 because a 16 can be responsible with beer. So I don't think it's so bad to let a 17yo father have a drink after the child's funeral. If he can be responsible with how often and how much he drinks, I think he should be trusted.\n\nSo I see both points of view.

In other countries, the drinking age is 16-18. In most states, including mine, there are laws that allow for people under 21 to drink at home with parental supervision. You didn't let him go get trashed at a bar or with friends, you let him work through his pain at home in your own care.

At his funeral, my friend's mom laid beside his coffin screaming and begging for him to come back. Saying she was sorry over and over and over again. His dad and brother had to lift her up and drag her away to calm her down, she was wailing in the worst way imaginable. It was absolutely the worst thing I've ever personally experienced, even 11 years later it makes me cry like a baby. I knew he had some issues, but I didn't even know Christian used or was severely depressed. Let alone enough to leave a note and choose to end his life.

You should talk to your husband and acknowledge his concerns. Together you should talk to your son about not using alcohol to hide from grief.

I think your husband is over reacting.", "NTA- If he was so concerned, he should have said something himself. \n\nA couple of beers after a funeral isn't always a great idea, but it's also not the end of the world. \n\nThe responsible thing to do would be to allow your son to grieve the way he wants to in the immediacy of the funeral, but then not allow him to continue drinking in the days that followed.", "NAH - you were right on your point and so is your hubby. \n\nIf your son is not drinking continuously then you don\u2019t have anything to worry about, but if he is, then you may need to step in and be there for him.", "I forget where I read it in the bible but it speaks of just this and I will paraphrase.

I\u2019m an adult. I rarely drink. I do not have a drinking problem of any kind, and I *do* occasionally have a drink after a hard day to help unwind. Your son just had an unbelievably hard day, a life experience that I\u2019m guessing your husband cannot personally relate to. Burying a child, I just cannot imagine that grief. As others have noted, if your boy is adult enough to bury a child, he\u2019s adult enough to have a couple of drinks after the funeral.

No. Is the time to discuss it while it is happening? No. Since this involves the death of a child I\u2019d say the window for even discussing coping is at least a few months if not a year away. Grief will take a while. But if he starts drinking daily then yes, you should say something. \n\nBut a one time occurrence. No. He will just remember you were there for him.", "NTA and in many European countries he's not too young.

It wasn't an escape so much as an aid at a level any adult would be understandable for.", "Nta but your husband isnt wrong either. Using alcohol as a coping mechanism leads to using drugs and alcohol just to feel different or feel anything and it never works. One should only drink to be happier not when they're sad because it only magnifys what one is already feeling. My father is an alcoholic, my bf and I both struggle with alcohol and my once firmly against alcohol brother is now a severe alcoholic as well as his wife whose mother was one. It's a disease and it spreads. Let him know of the dangers of using alcohol to cope.", "NTA. I\u2019m curious where your husband gets off coming after you over this. You were both there. You both saw him drink the beer. You both felt uncomfortable telling him not to, so you both declined. He made exactly the same decision as you for the exact same reason. If there were culpability to go around it would be equally split.\n\nNow, as for the question of the drinking itself I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably wise to let it go this time and intervene if it happens again.", "I don't think anyone was an AH. It's understandable where both of you are coming from. I would suggest having a discussion with your husband that focuses on why you made this choice but that you also understand where he's coming from. There is some danger in allowing someone to use a potentially addictive substance to deal with pain, especially if there is any family history of addiction.

Alcohol is not a Boogeyman, it is not a crutch, it is not cure. Having an occasional drink is fine, whatever the puritanical laws of your state may say. In most cultures having a drink with your family from even 8, is fine. I have and solidly credit that for not having an alcohol problem like many others in college. At 17 I was in college and would drink vermouth and rum primarily with dinner sometimes. I never got drunk at parties and had no issues with losing control. Other kids who had been completely blocked from alcohol went wild, got drunk on shitty beer and vodka, and ended parties throwing up. \n\nMy point is, everything in moderation. As parents you need to show him that drinking is fine and acceptable. Making a Puritan push that a few beers is a path to destruction is the kind of stupidity that can lead him to actually view alcohol as an escape.", " NTA", "NTA I can see your husband's point, but he didn't stop him either. However, everyone grieves differently and last I checked \"helping your teenager grieve their child\" isn't in many parenting books, and given what you said, you did better than my parents. ;) \n\nThat said, going forward teaching him some healthy coping would be good. Counseling would be great; I lost a child in similar circumstances at age 28, I couldn't imagine going through it at 17.", "NAH. I lost a daughter traumatically. Everyone grieves differently. I specifically avoided alcohol because my family has a high rate of addiction, and I didn\u2019t want to take chances while I was my most vulnerable. Your husband is not wrong for his concern. \nHowever, you\u2019re not wrong either. Your son has been handling everything extremely maturely, and has been the partner that his girlfriend needs.

Your poor son. a problem yes if he continues to drink to cope with his grief. No if he just needed some relief adn choose to have a couple beers.", "He... he was right there. Am I missing something?? Because it sounds like he did exactly what you did, saw his son start drinking and decided not to say anything because HIS CHILD JUST DIED FOR GOD SAKE. He had the same reaction you did, only difference is now he feels like he should've said something and he's projecting that on you.\n\nShould a 17yr old have been drinking? Probably not, but a 17yr old also shouldn't have to know the feeling of losing their baby. He's still very young and talking to him about coping mechanisms and why drinking shouldn't be one is a good idea, but not right after the funeral of his child, give it time and help him through his grief. \n\nYou and you husband also experienced that heavy loss because it was your grandchild so emotions are definitely running high, but this is not the time for your husband to be upset at you.\nI believe the weight of what happened is slowly sinking in for your son. Please talk to your husband and air out yalls feelings and grief and be there for your son before it sinks in so deep that it pulls him down. Don't smother him but don't let him go through this alone or believe he's alone. \nI'm sorry for your loss and I hope all of you can heal together with time", "Eeeeh. NAH. I wouldn't let my kid drink because, coming from a family of addicts and alcoholics and all that thrilling jazz, I would never want to see my child turn to alcohol for comfort and solace. It's a really bad habit to take on. \n\nSo, your husband has a point, but he also has a mouth and he could have said something to your son in the moment. Why is it all on you? He's just as culpable.\n\nI'd probably let him in the moment but talk to him later when things are a little less immediate.", "NTA, you recognized what was wrong but also that the moment was not the right time for a lecture. Why does it fall on you and not your husband to be the disciplinary? He could just as much have stopped it if it is so wrong. You don\u2019t owe your husband an apology. If anything he owes you an apology for pushing it on to you when he has eyes that saw it and a mouth to say something. He is equally if not more irresponsible by saying it has to be you.\n\nI agree with your husband that it COULD be a potentially slippery slope especially with  your son\u2019s emotional state, but it could be a slippery slope for anyone as that is one of the risks of alcohol, underage or not, sad or not.

An asshole response would be making a big deal over him doing something to cope with it that adults much older than him would also be doing to help cope with it.\n\nWhat him and his girlfriend both need is grief counseling if possible.
