If he starts using it more and more as a way to self medicate, it won't end well, trust me on this one. I turned to alcohol as medication in my late teens due to trauma and other issues. It took me a while to shake it. I would strongly suggest, if it's possible for you, to get him into grief counseling.

You didn't stop your son for the exact same reason your husband didn't say anything in the moment. It may not seem like it, but you actually pretty much agree with each other. (That said, I am very close to turning this into Not The Ass on the basis that your husband is trying to make it your fault - I'm currently thinking that this is his grief speaking, trying to make something into someone's fault so he has a reason to be angry...but if he doesn't apologise for that when you point this out, then he will be TA.)\n\nIt *isn't* a good habit to get into, but a one-off incident isn't a habit. Also, your child is hurting badly and then wasn't the time to scold him for something so minor.\n\nWhen a few days have passed, make sure you're keeping on communicating with your son about his grief, and that you're a safe place for him to express what he feels. See if you and your husband can come up with some alternate coping mechanisms and positive ways of expressing his grief. And then you can do your parenting thing and have a talk with your son about how he was feeling the day of the funeral, and did he feel the beer helped (hopefully not!) and why \"drowning your sorrows\" doesn't really work.\n\nBut the most important thing here is, as a family (as a pair of families together with your son's girlfriend's family), to give each other some grace right now.

I think you and your husband should have a discussion about it and if nothing else get on the same page.  If people are going to drink then learning drinking at home under the careful tutelage of parents is about the best we can expect.

That leads me to believe that one one you is probably a drunk and setting a horrible example.\n\nEspecially the drinking in response to emotional upheaval is concerning and can easily lead to addiction.
