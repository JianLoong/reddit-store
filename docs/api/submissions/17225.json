Your brother is the ones with multiple children with different mothers, and while I would never shame anyone for this. I will call him out for not being involved.\n\n I dare to say the reason your brothers like this is because he's never had to face the consequences of his actions. Often, at times, the problem child is the one parents glorify, and I can't help but wonder would the be so terrible if they were treated how they treat others. \n\nYou're a mother, too, and you deserve to be treated as such and not clean up after your brother. \n\nEnjoy your day and relax.
