Technically you **could have** written at midnight \"ok, I take no answers means no one is interested, trip is cancelled, I'm off to sleep\". But that is not mandatory on your part, that's a **courtesy** - no takers on the offer means nothing happens.\n\nI'm usually the one in my friends circle organizing trips or offering trip ideas - and a lot of the time people don't react to proposals to go somewhere. That means no one is interested, in which case, if me and the wife are going, we go alone.\n\nYour \"friends\" expect you to be their driver and mind-reader. They are the assholes here.", "How well does their ESP work with Uber?  It clearly didn\u2019t work with you.  Maybe next time they\u2019ll try being courteous.  NTA", "NTA. Sounds like you did your due diligence asking for a plan and gave them ample time to respond. It\u2019s pretty absurd to think you\u2019d just magically know that 6 am is \u201cthe\u201d time that everyone leaves to go skiing. TIL, I guess!", "NTA. They should have let you know they wanted to go before you piccking them up. Not after. Tell them to learn to communicate.", "I just want to confirm the order of events here: \n\n* You and your friends decided to go skiing\n* It was agreed (without asking) that you would drive and pick everyone up in the morning. You were aware of this. It annoyed you. \n* At 10pm you sent a text asking someone to confirm the details. \n* No one responded for 2 hours so you assumed the trip was canceled and went to bed.\n\nIf that's all correct, then ESH, including you. You and your friends need to get better at making plans.", "NTA - sounds like a lot of assuming going on and no one actually bothering to plan or communicate.", "Both you and your friends made assumptions, so it's weird to me that you're annoyed at them for making the assumption you would drive them but then you also turned around and assumed the trip wasn't happening after asking about the plan at the last minute...\n\nTo be fair, I wouldn't want people to assume I'm doing something either if I wasn't asked first, so I do understand your frustration with that and your friends definitely suck for that part. But is there a reason why you waited until 10pm to ask about what the plan was? Odds are a bunch of them were asleep or getting ready for bed at that point since they wanted to get up early for the ski trip. I fail to understand why you waited until the last second to ask about the plan if there was already a text exchange going on about it previously, so you suck for that part. Instead of waiting on everyone and staying up all late, you could have gone to bed earlier and then set an alarm to wake up on time for the trip and see if anyone replied in the morning. That way you would have had enough sleep and would have still been prepared in case it was for sure happening. If no one answered in the morning, then you could have gone back to sleep.\n\nESH.", "How did you find out everyone thought you would be the one driving? To me, you having this knowledge changes everything. With that info, you decided to send a TEXT to confirm plans. You don't text to confirm on such late notice, especially when it involves you driving which impacts others. You call. Call everyone if need be. If no one picks up then you can reasonably expect the plans are off. You let yourself become vindictive with knowledge that people thought you were driving and you upset yourself further by waiting for a response to your text for 2 HOURS. \n\n>And I know this isn\u2019t that big of a deal but like why couldn\u2019t they have just been adults and straight up asked me.

OP had the opportunity to say they weren't okay with the assumption that they would drive everyone, but instead chose to to just be annoyed about it.

Or if they didn't want to drive because of the assumptions made, OP could have suggested another alternative to see how the friends felt about it.
