So if the text exchange happened earlier in the day but OP waited until 10pm to confirm what the plan was when they had ample time to inquire, that's on them for asking so late in the day when people were asleep to be well rested for the trip.

I was just suggesting scenarios that could have happened that we aren't currently aware of that caused these events to play out the way they did. I'm not accusing anyone or making up a story like you're suggesting I am, I just pointed out potential missing pieces to the story since we only got the jist.

Because of all that, OP inquired (which they should have) but did so too late in the day for reasons we don't know. They could have been at work and couldn't answer right away, who knows.

I also didn't mention anything about the friends being at work (although that could have been a possibility), I said OP may have been at work or doing something that prevented them from responding and confirming the plans at an earlier time while the initial text exchange was going on, which is fair.

If the text exchange was happening all day (or even just in the evening) right up until 10pm but then all of a sudden stopped as soon as OP responded to confirm the plans, then the friends are assholes for not responding with the details and OP wouldn't be in the wrong at all.
