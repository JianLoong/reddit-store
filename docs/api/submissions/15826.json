But is there a reason why you waited until 10pm to ask about what the plan was? Odds are a bunch of them were asleep or getting ready for bed at that point since they wanted to get up early for the ski trip. I fail to understand why you waited until the last second to ask about the plan if there was already a text exchange going on about it previously, so you suck for that part. Instead of waiting on everyone and staying up all late, you could have gone to bed earlier and then set an alarm to wake up on time for the trip and see if anyone replied in the morning.
