I know that's gonna tank my ratio, but God damn, this shouldn't be confusing to anyone past 4th grade. They \"confirmed\" but op didn't like the *way* they confirmed, which wasn't explicitly asking him (this time). So he pretended he didn't understand, and left them waiting on him. He could have said \" I think I'll sit this one out\" at like 8:30p and still had the same impact without ruining everyone's day. \n\nHonestly the more I think about it, the more I realize how much of a narcissist move this was by op!", "Possibly they also expected a wake up call from OP", "Given that info, I\u2019m going to go with NTA. You did a poor job communicating, but I don\u2019t know how they expected you to know to get them at 6am. I\u2019ve skied for years and I\u2019ve never gone out to the slopes that early; I also would have been sleeping then. I don\u2019t think it was fair for them to have expected you to know that, especially if it was your first time going with this group.", "No sounds like they didn\u2019t want to do it, dragged their feet and waited to text everybody what\u2019s the plan until after they probably went to bed, so OP wouldn\u2019t be the bad guy cancelling. Sounds pretty clear there was enough of a general plan that OP should not have just assumed it was off", "When did you find out they expected you to get them at 6am? It seems like everyone but you were on the same page regarding the time. Did you know before you went to bed or did you not find out until you woke up?", "Your assumption is wrong\u2026\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/130rexb/aita_for_assuming_that_plans_fell_threw_after_no/ji06wrw/", "Man, the commenter above you seems needlessly defensive about this post, considering it's a vague mess with no discernable timeline. I interpreted the situation the same as you. They probably won't care, but you may feel vindicated to know OP has now confirmed that they did (passive aggressively) confirm to the group they would be driving by 8pm the day before.", "Eh, I probably would have just set my alarm for 5.30 anyway to check for responses. If there were no texts at that point, I would have gone back to sleep assuming the plan was off without guilt. I mean, if your last message was at 2200, surely it crossed your mind that everyone else may have gone to bed?", "NTA\n\nThey're assuming you knew you'd be driving?  And they're assuming you knew when to pick everyone us?  And this is from people who gave you crickets when you asked for a plan?\n\nYou owe them nothing.  You are NTA.  Maybe they'll learn to plan with you before arranging another trip. \n\nWhy didn't they \"just know\" that you weren't doing anything without a plan?  \n\nDon't let them guilt you.  They ruined the trip by not responding to your text and it's perfect karma.", "I hope they throw you a party when you get that invite to join the X-men with those mind reading abilities you apparently have.

All of you need to actually learn how to communicate. It shouldn't be that difficult to make plans. You weren't happy with the assumption you would drive? Did you actually express that? Sure, they shouldn't have assumed, but you should've actually communicated your own feelings and opinions.\n\nWhen did the conversation start? Could you have messaged them earlier in the day? Even just a couple of hours earlier? Or did you sit around waiting until 10pm to message. I don't about you, but personally I'm unlikely to respond to messages after about 9pm.", "NTA, you just taught them a useful lesson in communication skills, which being adults *they should have already known.*", "I'm not clear why this is such a big deal if he was going to drive there anyway.", "\u2026 and is annoyed, upon finding out *the next morning*, that she hasn\u2019t been asked!?

This whole post and comments reeks of bad communication and pettyness from everyone involved.", "Esh.\n\nI am assuming eevryone was asleep at 10pm because they had to be up at 6 am.\n\nYou knew you had to leave at 6 am so why think no one is going if no one replied? You also could have sent a message saying you assume the plans are canceled.\n\nThey could have informed you that you were picking them up.", "NTA.  Tell them to stop acting like children. \n\n1. If they expect you to drive, they need to ask.\n2. They need to have a time to meet.  This is their fault.\n3. Tell them to accept their fault in this.  Tell them also to grow up!", "\"Failure to communicate on your part, does not make me the asshole.\" Tell your \"friends\" to grow tf up and use their words when they get a request for info. NTA. You need better friends though.", "YTA.\n\nHere is what I heard from this:\n\nYou texted at the last possible second, at 10pm, for \"confirmation\" from people for a trip they'd be waking up at 5am to get ready for... You expected a response from someone, anyone at midnight. This is an unreasonable expectation, but you're really trying to sell it as people were ignoring you instead of people being asleep for an early morning trip.\n\nOut of everything you wrote you didn't write a single thing about what it was that was actually said in the chat about people's expectations. Just passively saying that IF you were the driver, you would have liked to have known it beforehand, but you aren't actually saying you didn't actually know these 5am travel times before hand....\n\nYou do realize that whether you're the driver or the passenger you would still have to get up early in the morning, so how does purposely staying up and then sleeping in make you in the right in any type of way? \n\nYou do realize that you have a part to play in being the assumed driver, because you are also a member of this party. And for all the time BEFORE 10pm, you aren't explaining what you texted, what you said, what you asked... Who did YOU assume was going to be the driver as they were making these plans? WHY did they assume you were the driver? Do you have the biggest car? Are you a designated driver in your group? Are you the only one in the group that actually knows where the heck this place is? Have you driven there before? Are you usually the driver in your friend's group? \n\nHonestly, nothing about no one texting you 7 hours before departure times means they canceled, so it's not rational at all for you to make that assumption. If the entire chat conversation is about how they are totally ready to go skiing, the conversation ending at bedtime doesn't somehow mean that they change their minds. \n\nThis entire thing sounds like you were just tired of people not asking you to be the driver so you passive aggressively whispered into the void that you weren't going to do it while everyone was asleep and then slept in on purpose to show them what's what. \n\nI'm surprised more people aren't catching on to this.", "I took it more as they designed OP the driver then never bothered to give them necessary details. OP waited for as long as possible for someone to bother to fill them in on the plan, finally asked about it themselve and *still* got no answer. At this point OP could only assume the plan fell through and went to bed.", "I've seen the phrase \"failure on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine\"", "OP has said they grudgingly agreed to drive earlier in the evening.", "To be fair if I was being picked up at 6am to do skiing I would definitely be in bed by 10pm and asleep. \ud83d\ude02 Doesn\u2019t mean the friends are in the right as obviously the communication here is terrible but waiting till 10pm to ask about a plan seems an odd choice to me.", "i agree that it was rude of the friends to just automatically assume that OP would be the driver, but in OP's response to me they indicated that they did in fact AGREE TO BE THE DRIVER, earlier on in the evening (around 8pm). and yeah, these people are all poor planners and should have firmed up exact times etc for the following morning pick-up, but it was implied (since they had taken this trip before) that there was a basic understanding of the morning's timetable. for OP to wait until 2 hours after having agreed to be the driver to send a text regarding morning details (when it was reasonable to assume that the others would be asleep by then) instead of actually contacting someone at that much earlier hour of 8pm to get the plans in place, it seems to me that OP somewhat sabotaged the trip because they were pissed about the group's assumption they would drive. but again, OP AGREED TO BE THE DRIVER the night before. it was not a next morning situation.", "ESH\n\nWithout full transcript it is not that clear, but you obviously didn't want to go if you are the driver...", "I'm going against the general consensus at this point, but I'm going to say YTA. It sounds to me that you and your friends often go on trips together, and you probably always drive. They assumed that you would again for this skiing trip, but you wanted to be asked (which is fair! Your friends should not assume, but I know this happens often and as you stated \"this isn't that big of a deal\"). The night before, you decide to not message anyone until 11PM AT NIGHT before the ski trip, when most people leave by 6am (as you imply here: \"I should\u2019ve just known when to leave because that when everyone leaves\"). If I were your friends, yes - in the wrong for assuming you'd drive - but I would assume that you would pick us up at the usual time and DEFINITELY be in bed by 10pm the night before if I knew you were coming by 6 for a day of skiing. It just sounds to me like you were being a little petty - which is never a good look.", "NTA - you need confirmation from them especially if you're the one that's supposed to be driving. It really sounds like they were treating you as a driver more than anything else...", "Now they know to be very clear in confirming plans. A low stakes lesson.

Did all of you discuss the trip and someone said \"and then OP will pick everybody up\" without asking you first? Did you then grudgingly say \"OK\" or say anything else which could cause the others to think you were OK with driving? \n\nOr was there never really any talk about who would do the driving and everybody just silently expected you to drive, but it was never actually stated, so that you only got the final confirmation when they asked you in the morning where you were?\n\nIn the first case, ESH for not really planning things and leaving out the details (like when you were expected to pick people up) plus you waiting with the questions until the very last moment.\n\nIn the second case, NTA because nobody ever told you you were ACTUALLY expected to do the driving, but still bad communication skills on all sides.", "ESH.

Or they'll respond that they are down, but when asked for necessary details there's no more replies. How do you deal with this? It feels so disrespectful to me and trying to work around it takes a lot of energy.", "The \"ample time to respond\" was when most people would be sleeping or preparing to sleep.", "\"Piss poor planning on your part does not constitue a crisis on my part.\"\n\nNTA!", "It\u2019s worse because the friends assumed OP would be doing something and then did nothing to confirm with them, basically just saddling OP with a task they didn\u2019t actually agree to", "A general idea of a plan is not a plan.
