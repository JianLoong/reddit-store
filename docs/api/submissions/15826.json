I can't even imagine how badly communication in this friend group goes.", "ESH it sounds like the plan was already in place to leave at 5/6am, you just hadn\u2019t confirmed? unless you guys were already only texting about it late that evening, with a 5/6am wake up call 10pm is way too late in the evening to be asking for confirmation as they were probably in bed already. they shouldn\u2019t have just assumed you\u2019d drive though and should have also reached out to you earlier in the day, bad communication all around. it was on the friends to confirm, but assuming OP knew about this earlier in the day i don\u2019t understood why they waited until their friends were already asleep to ask for them to confirm.", "If I understand correctly, you did know the plan, but waited until 10 PM to ask ever one to confirm? You waited so late when you were planning to get up so early that people were probably already asleep? If so, YTA.", "NTA\n\nPlans should have been sorted out earlier.", "NTA. No one gave you any information or asked you to drive. If you're the last thing they think of, you don't need to prioritize them.", "No response mean not happening. Particularly when you've been forcibly allotted the role of driver.\nI personally would have written a follow up of \"I assume it's not going ahead then.\" But that's because I'm petty! NTA", "NTA. Nobody wanted to tell you that you would be driving and now they are getting upset ?", "their inability to...gasp..communicate, does not constitute an obligation on your part. they ducked around and found out. NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Can't believe people are saying because OP didn't confirm or say they weren't happy they weren't asked to drive its their fault? Why is it OPs responsibility when they weren't even asked? I would be pissed. Now the 'friends' will know to actually ask and properly plan events before assuming.", "NTA. It's not fair for OP's friends to assume that they would be the driver without even asking. OP made an effort to clarify the plan and received no response, so it's understandable that they assumed the trip was cancelled. It's not their responsibility to read their friends' minds or stay up late waiting for a response. The friends should have communicated better and not put all the responsibility on OP.", "At midnight I would have sent a text of \"No one confirms? I guess we're not going.\"", "NTA.\n\nMore and more people are just downright lazy about stuff.\n\nThey probably want to believe that since you were driving, it was up to you to organize them around that completely. Tell them when to leave, when to pack by, when to wake up, etc. etc. be their surrogate mommy since you \u201cowned\u201d driving them there.\n\nPeople just stop thinking when they believe someone else \u201cowns\u201d the task. They want others to do the thinking for them.", "NTA, the lack of planning and communicating that plan on their part, does not constitute an assumption of leaving at 6AM on your part.", "Nta. Their poor planning does not constitute your emergency.", "I get why so many people are saying NTA, but personally I think the fact that all of OP\u2019s friends were on the same page about what time to leave and how they\u2019d be getting there indicates that there was some additional communication or information here that OP hasn\u2019t told us. \n\nFor example, maybe they go skiing regularly, OP is the only one with easy access to a car and doesn\u2019t want other people driving it, and they always leave around the same time? In that scenario, it would make sense that the friends all thought everyone understood the plan was the same as usual, and were all asleep by 10pm to be up early for skiing. That would make the friends\u2019 behavior make a lot more sense, and doesn\u2019t conflict with anything OP has said about what happened; if that\u2019s the case, then YTA.\n\nI suspect some information is being hidden; that many people don\u2019t behave that irrationally for no reason at all. With that in mind, without being able to know the exact circumstances, ESH.", "True friends do not assume and if they are adults like a lot of us they verify everything. That's on their back not yours and if they are assuming that you can drive without proper rest that's their problem not yours. Please do not drive without proper rest. You are NTA they are", "NTA\n\nThere's a lot of ASS U ME going on.", "NTA you are not a mind reader. And you do not owe entitle, non-communicative people rides.", "They seem to expect you to be their Mother. Always ready, always one step ahead, always cleaning up their mess. NTA. Their failure to communicate is not your problem.", "Eh, I have a group I go with and we do have a set time to meet that we default to unless otherwise specified. That part isn't so weird if OP and these specific friends go regularly. That being said, everybody always confirms that we're on and who's driving the night before, because a vague \"yeah let's go up on Saturday\" earlier in the week often turns into \"I forgot I have to ____ so I'm out\" a day or two before. So unless OP is misrepresenting how firm this plan was, the friends definitely should have also checked in to confirm at some point as well, and it's on them for not doing so.", "No, I think op found out everyone assumed they would drive when they were all mad about it the next morning.", "I'm also going with ESH. If we had plans for a trip that required waking up at 1am, I am already in bed by 10pm. I don't understand how you waited until a few hours before to tell everyone you had no idea what the plans were? I'm going to take the fact that you said no one told you at face value. I'm skeptical, that's true. How old are you all?", "Agreed that these people need to communicate better, but I'm side eyeing OP on this one. Even though they nominated OP to drive instead of asking, OP sems to have agreed to do so. If OP had an issue with this, they could have declined and voiced their displeasure. They did not. It also seems like 6am was the agreed upon time that everyone, OP included, was aware of.\n\nIf OP wanted to reconfirm the 6am agreed upon time, why wait until 10pm to ask, when everyone would have more than likely already gone to bed in preparation for the early departure.", "TBH, I don\u2019t think OP assumed. \n\nOP laid down a boundary \u201csomeone better dang we\u2019ll confirm details, other wise I\u2019m going to sleep and I\u2019m. Or driving or going on the trip\u201d\n\nOP just said it slightly nicer/less direct.", "If OP assumes the trip is cancelled the worst that happens is that OP doesn't show up. Unless of course the rest of the group has assumed that op is picking them up without communicating that.", "My reading is that OP discovered upon waking up the next day that they were expecting to be picked up at 6am, not that that had been discussed the day before. Hence the need to ask for clarification the night before.", "But that's not what was all texted, according to the post. OP said they texted to ask to confirm the details of the plan. That was it. Then because no one answered within 2 hours, they figured the trip wasn't happening. That's literally an assumption. Lol. \n\nIt doesn't say anywhere that OP texted everyone to say they were going to bed and figured the trip wasn't happening. Obviously we can't see the texts to know exactly what anyone said, so I can only go off of what was described in the post which was basically all miscommunications and people making assumptions based on the lack of information and/or boundaries given.", "The Vultures are a perfect reference for this friend group.", "OP didn\u2019t know when they were suppose to pick people up. If you don\u2019t confirm plans with the driver, that\u2019s on you, and *you* cancelled the trip. Not the driver.", "> Like I said, either OP is terrible at telling a story or she did know exactly what the plan was.\n\nThere is *at least* one more option here: you misunderstood.", "Except the whole point of this post was OP kept asking for details and no one could give her any.", "How did everyone else know what time but OP didn't even though they were included in the group chat tho? The issue here is that there wasn't enough detail in the story. We don't know how many people were involved and how many texts there were. There may have been a zillion texts, so maybe a text somewhere in the depths of the chain said what time and OP missed it or couldn't find it. Or if there weren't too many texts, OP just didn't go thru the thread well enough to fully know what was going on. It is also unclear when the initial text exchange occurred. So if the text exchange happened earlier in the day but OP waited until 10pm to confirm what the plan was when they had ample time to inquire, that's on them for asking so late in the day when people were asleep to be well rested for the trip. Since there is a lot missing in the story, based on what was stated I feel like ESH and there needed to be better communication and less assumptions made by everyone involved.", "But op knew ahead of time this was the assumption\n\nEveryone's the asshole"]}
