You were a consenting adult providing a service to other consenting adults willing to pay for the privilege of sharing your company. It was none of your parents business and you apparently made it out safely. This happened more than a decade ago. Why is anyone so upset about something that isn't even happening anymore. I understand why you kept this from your family because they sound very judgmental and overbearing.", "NTA,\n\ngot to love your grandpa lol!", "Nta. And if it\u2019s illegal where you live, tell them to keep their mouths shut.", "NTA. - tell mom and sisters to get over it! Gotta say grandpa\u2019s a trip.", "NTA you did what you had to do to make money.", "NTA, you aren\u2019t obligated to tell anyone, particularly over-imposing family members, what you do in your free time.", "NTA - it\u2019s fine not to be 100% transparent with family after turning 18.", "Nta\nThey can be surprised, shocked, even disgusted (though that would be hateful and mean), but they can't be hurt.

I was a stripper for 15 years and told my mother I was a bartender. I do not drink and don't know a Buttery Nipple or a Fireball from a hole in the ground\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.

Still:\n\nI think for them it might feel like they are less close to you because you didn\u2019t tell them about this aspect of your life. And this job might feel more personal to them than a -for the lack of better words- \u201enormal\u201c job. At least without having any further insight.

If I had hemorrhoids I'd be ok with it but I wouldn't want everyone to know. And I'd absolutely tell some folks but not others.", "Actually I think all of that makes perfect sense. Although it was a job, it was still his sex  life. Do you advertise your sex life to everyone in your family?", "Yeah, I think the better thing would have been to tell your immediate family at that point. I'm never on board with making another person complicit in your lie, and when the truth comes out they always seem to get blowback for having been in on the secret."]}
