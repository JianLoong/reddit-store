If you don\u2019t know blue heelers are externally possessive. For the first two years of my dogs life I lived with my nephew and had my own room which my dog was possessive over. I tried teaching my nephew that if he came into the room we couldn\u2019t rough house and he couldn\u2019t be rambunctious because my dog would think he was being aggressive towards me. \n\nHe never listened back then. He\u2019d always run in, jump on my bed, and act like we were fighting. My dog would get upset and start growling at him. \nAt first he understood that was her warning him and would calm down. But as he\u2019s gotten older it\u2019s gotten worse. \n\nI moved out a year ago but regularly bring my dog to the family house. (They have a lot of land and wild life so she can let out energy) \n\nOn Christmas my nephew got a hover board. I calmly asked him if he rides it to not get too close to me. My dog likes to stay by my side and she can get anxious with loud noises like that. \n\nAt first my nephew did a good job but started slipping up. I warned him 4-5 times and he continued doing it. He got close to me and my dog started growling at him and he continued to get closer. I tried warning him but he didn\u2019t listen and she snapped at him. \n\nHe got upset and started saying how she was a bad dog. I told him I had warned him and he didn\u2019t listen to me. (I took action in disciplining my dog but I was still upset with him for not listening )\n\nI thought he would\u2019ve learned his lesson (my dog to) but an hour later he continued to drive around her on the hover board. Now when I say driving around her I mean almost running her over. \n\nHe ended up running into her and she snapped at him again. That\u2019s when I yelled at him. I told him she wouldn\u2019t act that way if he\u2019d stay away from her on the hover board. But he got upset and told his parents I was just being mean \n\nAITAH? \nPs.

Yes, blue heelers are known to be possessive, but they are extremely intelligent and are easily trained out of these behaviours by someone that knows what they\u2019re doing. Resource guarding is dangerous and can lead to bites. \n\nLeave the dog at home next time. \n\nAdditionally, as a dog trainer, do NOT punish the dog for snapping.

I have a heeler. YTA for yelling because getting nipped by a dog is scary, even if it is a heeler warning nip not an actual bite. Other commenters- heelers are bred to do this, it is ingrained. Mine, at least, is quick, gentle, and surprising, not teeth actually closing on flesh. It\u2019s how they move livestock around. \n\nThat being said, people have expectations for dog behavior, and heelers generally fall short of expectations without a lot of careful training. It is not enough to tell your nephew to  give your dog space. From the very beginning you should have had a big stockpile of treats for your nephew to feed your dog, every time he came into the room. Instead, you got nervous and scolded him, which made things worse- heelers pick up on that and try to \u201chelp.\u201d\n\nNow, if you want to bring the dog, she has to start on leash. You need to project calm, and get your nephew and everybody else to give her treats until she accepts them all into her orbit.

If your dog does bite the child, it will be YOUR DOG that will be put to sleep, NOT the child!", "Just understand that when she bites him or somebody elses you will be held financially and legally responsible. The dog will most likely be put down and you will be sued", "Soooo many excuses. You dont need to take your dog everywhere.", "So if you can openly say your nephew \u201cjust has issues\u201d why are you okay with continuing to bring your dog around him? He clearly stresses your dog out and she\u2019s not comfortable with his play style. Why are you forcing her to get to the point that she\u2019s growling and snapping? Part of training a dog is setting them up for success, but you\u2019re repeatedly setting your dog up for failure and creating more negative associations with your nephew. Keep your dog away from your nephew, for everyone\u2019s safety and comfort. Join r/dogtraining and ask for advice because you clearly don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing here and you\u2019re going to end up with a dog who seriously bites your nephew, and your dog will pay the consequences for YOUR negligence.

He get stressed out when people yell.", "It\u2019s not that easy. Every dog is different. Yes, there should be more training but some dogs simply are territorial and protective and that can be managed but not eliminated.

If op had waited till they got their own home n trained the dog first n learned how to introduce a dog to a child then this could've been a different story. From the kids point of view they suddenly would be getting in trouble for playing with their family in their own home. Of course the kid gonna play up.

My dog was kicked by a small boy when he lived with his previous owners. He would growl and snap at kids for years while we underwent training. He\u2019s an Australian kelpie mix with high intelligence and stubbornness. \n\nI NEVER let him near my nephews. Not until they were old enough that I could trust them. He stayed home for family gatherings, and I wouldn\u2019t take him near kids in the street. It had nothing to do with anyone\u2019s feelings on the matter; it just meant that he was protected, and so was every kid he came across. He can now be in the same room as them and allows them to interact with him. When he barks or growls, we leave the room. I would never shout at my nephews for upsetting him, because they just don\u2019t understand what he\u2019s been through and why he is the way he is. \n\nDisciplining the dog is just as bad as yelling at it. When your dog is overstimulated and stressed, you leave. Yes your nephew should behave better around animals, but you shouldn\u2019t be bringing a reactive dog around kids that skirt boundaries. Especially when you say it\u2019s been a recurring issue.", "INFO ; dogs as in plural?", "Calmly explain to your EIGHT YEAR OLD nephew who seems to like to provoke your dog that if he can't be nice and caring towards the dog you will not visit. Then next time he provokes it, pack up and leave. Protect your dog. Eight year old is well past the age where you can show empathy and know when you are acting wrong. Leaving sends a very strong message to the boy and to his parents, who likely will help you teach the boy manners and back you up.", "Why is the dog even there?

You can't enforce boundaries with your dog or the kid. Talk to his parents next time. But also, stop bringing your dog there. Especially if you aren't going to get it training.

I\u2019ll accept that didn\u2019t happen. \nYou just bought a puppy like you buy groceries. \nWhy didn\u2019t you train the dog? Why in the years you have her, you have not put in the time?", "OP, on here all people read is \"dog\" versus \"Child/BaBy\". Kid being a boy only makes them excuse him even more. Ignore it, keep training your dog and protect your dog from this person.

She shouldn't be around other people.", "I don't even yell at my children, let alone other's. So I highly disagree with you. My Mom yelled all the time, and I refuse to be like her in that regard. It's an unhealthy habit to teach. Unless there's a very justifiable reason to yell, there are much better ways of dealing with people.", "Reread my comment. I never said that OP is in the wrong for telling the kid he was misbehaving. I said they were wrong for yelling at an EIGHT year old (while the boy's parents were there and could have handled it) when OP is the one who knowingly put everyone in a bad situation. \n\nOf course people have an obligation to speak up and tell a child, or anyone for that matter, when they're behaving wrong. Telling and yelling are two very different things, though. You're comparing two totally different situations, with two completely different age groups, as well, and I'm not about to go into explaining to you why you were correct in your (gross) situation and OP is wrong in theirs.", "So you got a dog breed you aren\u2019t a fit owner for, how again is that anyone\u2019s fault but yours?", "I stand by what I said that poor dog will end up being put down if you don\u2019t keep this child from the dog.

Simple.", "The kid was 5 when good old aunt decided to get a dog n have that dog have more rights to act how it wants in the 5 yr old home then the 5 year old n then continues doing so for 3 years.

OP lived in kids house for the first 2 years of the dogs life, so when the kid was between 5 & 7", "Why is it okay that your dog doesnt always listen, but not ok that your 8 year old nephew doesnt always listen? You extend much more understanding to the dog than the human child.", "There\u2019s no explanation that excuses blaming a child for the aggression of your dog.

Why would you knowingly bring an \"misbehaving\" (ie, AGGRESSIVE) dog around children?", "No it was a miss type", "I\u2019ve made another comment explaining it more. My whole family wanted my dog there with me. \n\nAlso my brother has an issue with how my nephew behaves around my dog. He\u2019s on my side with how my nephew needs to respect her boundaries. \nI\u2019ll admit she use to be bad when I lived with them. I was 17 and wasn\u2019t ready for a dog. But I learned and matured and have been training with her for a long time now. \nShe isn\u2019t as bad as she use to be. She\u2019s gotten a lot better. \nNow she just has issues when people act like they\u2019re going to punch me (wrestle) and make loud noises (not just talking loud or yelling I mean things like the hover board) it\u2019s been a long process. Blue heelers are stubborn and territorial breeds but like I said we\u2019re making process", "She does. She loves people and has gotten a lot better since we lived with my family. He just kept nearly running her over on the hoverboard and that\u2019s why I snapped on him.", "I did take her outside. This didn\u2019t happen in a span of 10-20 minutes it was all day.

This isn\u2019t an excuse Ik but I\u2019ve been trying", "The child should also learn boundaries and to listen to instruction.\n\nHe is not being told to keep his distance for shits and giggles, it\u2019s to respect the dog\u2019s boundaries for their mutual safety.\n\nAnd the reminding this far has been gentle. It hasn\u2019t worked. That means apparently, voices need to be raised in order for the message to sink in.", "It was also her home. It was only an issue in her bedroom, which the 5 year old doesn't have automatic access to because he lives there too. He would enter her and the dogs room and and disrespect the rules of it.", "He didn't get bit, and even well trained, well socialized dogs will eventually snap when kids are allowed to continuously harass them.  \n\nIt's quite often the reason kids get bit in fact. Dog is minding their own business,  kid harassing them, parents laugh instead of correcting their brat, and dog finally defends itself. It is still the fault of the child and the parents.", "Ohhhh ok that makes a lot more sense ! I was so confused how he was 5", "I bet they just say that to not hurt your feelings\u2026I think most people would be just fine with you saying \u201c I left her at home,she doesn\u2019t do well with the noise\u201d and everyone is safe and happy and no one is getting yelled at", "Thats because youre the family oddball who never goes anywhere without the dog", "I, too, would react if your nephew nearly ran me over, repeatedly and obviously not by accident. And not calmly. Protect your dog. Keep it away from the child who thinks scaring animals is a fun activity.", "Which you dog picked up on and also snapped at him. My point remains, don't parent their kid and stop bringing your dog around him. For both their sakes.", "As a dog parent, it was YOUR responsibility to remove the dog from the situation! The kid was simply playing IN HIS OWN HOUSE!", "You might have been trying, but you have been failing spectacularly and it will cost you the relationship with your nephew to begin with. You got the money to buy a purebred in the height of the pandemic when prices skyrocketed. Find the money now to get proper dog training. And you also need to be trained with the dog. Otherwise, just rehome her to someone who will properly take care of her.", "Then get a lock. Or better yet instead of buying a dog find your own place first then get a dog.", "I was going to leave her home because i don\u2019t like how her and my nephew act around eachother but my grandfather and brother begged me to bring her.
