Forcing vegetarianism on him would be demanding that he stop eating meat at all. Simply requesting that he take a short break from having meat cooked at home out of respect for your culture is reasonable and a compromise that he should be able to make out of love and respect for you as his spouse. He can always go grab a burger outside if he really can\u2019t go 10 days without it.", "If he won\u2019t even accommodate you for 10 days, I would stop cooking meat for him. Actually I would stop cooking meat altogether if it\u2019s not in your belief system. Meat eaters can also eat non-meat foods. NTA.", "NAH. Don\u2019t cook him meat if you don\u2019t want to cook it, but don\u2019t say he can\u2019t have meat at all.

Your guests need to understand they aren\u2019t visiting a fully vegetarian home.", "NTA hospitality isn\u2019t an unreasonable request", "NTA\n\nLifelong vegetarians who are vegetarian because of their culture would not be comfortable in a house where there is meat being cooked, because they will see it and even worse probably, smell it cooking. Assuming only vegetarian dishes will be served at all meals during that time the OP obviously should not be expected to cook anything with meat for her husband. If he wants to go out and eat a meat sandwich or get a burger and some wings, there are places he can go for that called restaurants. Or he can pick up at a deli and eat it in his car. It shouldn't be a big deal.", "I can see your side of it, so NTA. BUT... it IS HIS home. If the guests were staying for a weekend, sure. But 10 days is a long time to have guests, let alone change the way he eats. \n\nI remember asking my new husband not to drink a beer when my parents came over because they never drank alcohol and I was so used to doing everything their way. Husband scoffed and said it was his house, and when my dad paid the mortgage, he could make the rules. Turned out that my husband got a beer, he offered one to my parents, and my dad took him up on it. Didn't bother my \"guests\" at all that other people do things differently in their own homes.", "Me and my wife are like you two. She is vegetarian and I am not. She would just ask me to grill outside or not eat meat in the house. I would say \u201cOf course\u201d \nWe treat it like adults and respect each other.", "Info: what do you mean by \"making sure the guests are comfortable\"? Do you think they will judge him on his choice to eat meat? Do they not know he eats meat and you are afraid a discussion will ensue? Or what exactly does that worry you?", "So you prioritize making your husband happy over your happiness. \n\nDo you think he does the same thing for you?\n\nDoes he ever think about your feelings? Are you just cares about his own? \n\nI feel like there is a bigger issue.", "NTA\n\nThat is a completely reasonable request to make.", "About you not cooking meat yourself: NTA. If you're not comfortable preparing meals with meat, you don't *ever* have to do so. That you're doing so at all is generous.\n\nAbout not having meat served at all in the house while they visit: Y-T-A. Your parents have a reasonable expectation that there won't be meat on the plates in front of them. It's not really their business what's on any *other* plate. (Unless of course it physically affects them in some way, like an allergy where even a microscopic amount of contact could pose a risk.)", "Seeing your comments, I feel like NTA. It sounds like you, a vegetarian, adjust and cook meat because you love your husband, so it's a very small ask for him to not eat meat in your guys's for only 10 days.", "You are NTA for expecting some reciprocity. Just as you cook meat for him to be happy, he should want to do the same for you when it comes to making your guests comfortable. He can go out to eat for a couple of those days. I think your Husband is an AH for taking your request out of context.", "Nta. He doesn't have the right to have meat personally cooked for him. (He does have the right to go pick up meat someone else prepared or to make it himself though.) It is a bit irritating for people to come into your home and change around what you usually do because of it. But you make the meat, you decide when or if you continue to do it.", "I agree. You cook meat for him, despite being a vegetarian, he can certainly forgo meat in the house for 10 days. Of course he has the right to refuse, but it's not at all an unreasonable request on your part, so NTA.", "NTA. You do all the cooking, so you are fully able to decide that you will not be cooking meat while your family visits. \n\nYou would only be the AH if you also tried to prevent him for cooking meat for himself.", "NTA\n\nHonestly I'm super surprised that you cook meat for him at all - cooking shared meals is one thing (with whatever sharing of that work works for you) but I'd expect that if someone wants anything just for them they need to cook it themselves.\n\nI've also met plenty of households where the house is kept veggie and some of the people will eat meat when not in the house. After all eating meat doesn't mean that one can't eat food that doesn't have meat in.\n\nYour husband has made no compromises here and really \"has it lucky\" - he's being quite selfish in general, and particularly when there's a reason to do things differently for a short time.\n\nTo be fair, it is unusual to make a large change for visitors - but I don't think anyone would think the ask was weird if it was e.g. not eating nuts in the house for a week while someone with a severe allergy was visiting. \n\nIt's an overall relatively minor adjustment, and while he may be relieved when he can go back to normal really it's not an unreasonable thing to be asked to do.", "NTA. Seems like a simple ask from your husband\u2026 to respect you and your relatives enough to ensure they\u2019re comfortable in your home.", "I'd say NTA. This is a completely reasonable request, you already accommodate him greatly, and \"eating meat exclusively\" is, frankly, a really weird and childish way to structure your diet to avoid vegetarianism. Like, I went vegetarian for a few years because I realized with the exception of going out to eat or trying special recipes, I was already eating vegetarian dishes 90% of the time (albeit with a ton of cheese and eggs, so not really that hard to make work).\n\nE: More than just the vegetarian/meat thing, it's just generally odd/poor hosting to cook things specifically for yourself while you have guests. This applies more to short term visits than long-term, and a 10-day visit is kind of on the borderline, but constantly making your husband a totally separate meal from guests every day would be very strange even if it wasn't because he refuses to eat vegetarian dishes for some reason.", "Lifelong and super strict vegetarian here: YTA.\n\nI get where you\u2019re coming from. I really do. BUT your dietary choices and those of your family are yours and yours alone. Not his.\n\nWhen I visit another place I don\u2019t take it for granted of they adjust their preferences to suit mine. I\u2019m very, very grateful if they do, but I\u2019m equally happy to just munch on some salad or nibble on some baguette that I know is vegetarian. Because it\u2019s MY choice and my visit should never inconvenience others.\n\nHe can cook meat for himself if he wants to. As long as it doesn\u2019t contaminate the vegetarian dishes, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\n\nAnd if you have an issue with preparing meat for him, totally valid. Make it clear you will be happy to continue making vegetarian dishes and if he wants meat along with it, he can make it himself.", "NTA. This is not a big ask at all and your husband is being really overdramatic throwing this little fit about eating meatless dishes for one lousy week. Is he aware that he can take himself out to eat as well? Burger joints are everywhere, I'm sure he is capable of finding one.", "NTA. When you have guests, you may have to change some of your habits to make them more comfortable in your home. That\u2019s common sense and something we all mostly do (we may cover up a bit more, try not to wake the guests or keep them up to late, etc). This doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable at all.", "I guess it depends on how much he likes vegetarian food. Some people might really struggle but if he is ok with non meat food that 10 days is not much to ask.", "NAH\n\nIt\u2019s 10 days to make a guest feel comfortable. You\u2019re not forcing him to stop eating meat. Just not to cook it at home for less than a fortnight.", "I don't think it's too much to ask. If I'm correct in thinking you had the actual baby, you've done quite a bit of sacrificing yourself and will probably continue to do so.", "Not the asshole.\n\n\nHe has a go at you for \"forcing\" him to be a vegetarian just because you don't want to upset your relatives who are visiting and staying with you, when you literally cook him meat dishes all year round despite being a vegetarian yourself. If he wants to eat meat, he can cook it himself.", "NTA Can he prepare a secret stash ahead of time? When my brother became a vegetarian, he cooked a couple of times when he visited. My dad enjoyed the dishes but he secretly ginned everything up with his secret tub of ground beef.", "I think kinda YTA here. \n\nWhen I visit someone else, I expect to conform to their habits and patterns, not the other way around. Your parents can eat vegetarian just like you do without making your husband change everything. Cook like you guys would normally cook, but triple up the vegetarian portion.\n\nHim eating normally shouldn't make your prayers uncomfortable. Unless you're hiding the fact that he eats meat from your parents. If that's what's going on, you have a completely different set of issues to deal with.", "Why doesn't he cook his own food?", "I think you're kind of an AH.  You knew this about him when you married him\n\n\"Is it too much to ask to adjust for 10 days while I do the adjustment for him all year around.\"\n\nNot if you're willing to make an equal adjustment where you eat meat for 10 days.\n\nNobody is going to tell me how to eat in my own home.", "Yta. He lives there too not just you. He should be able to feel comfortable in his own home. You knew he wasn\u2019t vegetarian when you got with him. If your guest are going to be that uncomfortable they can stay somewhere else and have you visit. Or they can accept that not everyone eats like you or them. And maybe it might just be that he has his own special pan cook meat in and then you can make their food. I would understand if someone had like a really bad food allergy that would make sense. But it feels like your asking him to respect your culture without caring about his.", "Don't cook it for him, but he should be able to cook himself whatever he wants to in his home.", "YTA it's his house. You and your family have no right to judge your husband for eating meat.", "Info\n\nIs it ok if he cooks the meat for himself?", "NTA but it's his house no guest should affect your own life when in your house it's the only place in the world where you can feel free to do as you please", "YTA.  It's his home too!  Accommodations certainly are in order, like no bacon or other exceptionally smelly stuff. But come on- you shouldn't have married if you were going to make demands like this.", "Eh Nta but I don\u2019t think a guests comfort should trump anyone\u2019s comfort in their own home. Who cares honestly? They shouldn\u2019t impose their choices on their host", "NTA. He can satisfy his carnivorous streak with a burger or a kebab when he's out of the house. You're not asking him to fast for 10 days.", "ESH, but leaning a little towards YTA. Him for not being willing to adjust for 10 days if you do cook meat for him all year, sure. But also you for not making it clear to your guests that they're visiting the home of a meat eater and should expect the possibility of people preparing or eating meat, and if that's a problem, here's the nearest hotel. Why are your guests getting preferential treatment over your husband in his own home? I'd never rock up in someone's home and expect them to take on my lifestyle, just to keep me offense-free.", "NTA. You are not asking him to give up meat, not even for the 10 days or so. If he can't be a gracious host to your family and make one small temporary adjustment, maybe he should get an air BnB during their visit, for them or himself", "NTA you cook meat dishes for him all the time he can survive off a few weeks worth of vegetarian dinners and if he has that big of an issue he should act like he's going to the gym and get himself a burger after lol", "NTA. 10 days is not a huge sacrifice. If meat is that critical, he could grab a meal or two  outside.", "NAH ~~YTA~~ \\- whether it's done for religious or ethical reasons, why would you impose them on someone who does not subscribe to them, especially in his own home?\n\nEdited:  N-A-H unless OP continues to press on the issue.", "NTA. I'm vegetarian and no one else in my family is- including my DH. He is a die hard carnivore,  but ALWAYS makes concessions for me.  I also make concessions for him by buying dead animal products for him and even cooking it at times (huge ugh).  That is what you do when you enter into a partnership. Your husband can go grab  a burger or fix meat for himself if he is absolutely dying.  10 days is not the end of the world FFS.", "NTA, often eat meat/fish free foods, so no big deal not to have it for 10 days, if desperate to eat meat there is always the takeaways ?", "No idea who is right or wrong here, maybe ESH. You guys are both strange. Why do you cook meat for him if it is against your culture and makes you feel resentment after 10 years? Why does he not cook his own food as a normal adult or is it same old misogyny \u201cwomen belong on the kitchen\u201d? Why should he abandon being himself in his own home and stop eating what he eats for the whole TEN DAYS? I would understand one evening, but come on. If my husband requested me do that, then my in laws would be staying in the hotel or airbnb. I would even pay for that.\n\nI am honestly not sure why you are even together", "Your not really TA because of the accommodation you make for him year round. Theoretically he should be fine with going 10 days vegetarian and going out if he must have meat. \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s his home too, and the discussion of whether or not meat could be cooked in the house while your family is visiting should have occurred before the plans were made to have them stay with you. \n\nPresumably, it\u2019s his house too and I feel icky that he\u2019s being asked to change his diet in the comfort of his own home because of guests. But I also feel icky that you make such an accommodation for him daily, surely he can step up and do some cooking. My husband does most of the cooking and he ensures that the meals are safe for me (celiac) but it\u2019s not that hard to do for us. If he had a cultural reason to cook with flour on everything I\u2019d be be preparing my own food for myself. But I absolutely wouldn\u2019t be eating flour just because his parents came over and it was their culture. I know the example isn\u2019t exactly the same since mine is 100% stomach problem and not a choice like his is. \n\nI\u2019m kind of stuck in an ESH mood, and my judgement is your husband needs to start cooking his own meat, or suck it up and be sort of a vegetarian for 10 days.", "NTA. Normaly i go with YTA on these kinds of posts, but you aren't really forcing anything on him are you. If you tell him not to cook meat for himself then thats different, but its totaly fine not to cook meat for him.", "Seems like he doesn't respect your culture.", "YTA\n\nYour husband lives there. Your family is just visiting. Why on earth should he stop eating what he likes during their visit?\n\nIf it's such an inconvenience, they're better off staying at a hotel.", "YTA - You are valuing your culture and your guests\u2019 needs over those of your husband.  You married someone with a different culture; one that eats meat. Saying he can just change is disrespectful to his culture. To ask him to completely alter his diet in his own home is a big ask.  If your guests are not comfortable in a house with a non-vegetarian, they could make arrangements to stay elsewhere. Or perhaps you would prefer your husband stay elsewhere during their visit??", "NTA. It's 10 days, not a year. Relationships are often about compromise, and he can go out for a steak if he just can't handle it... ffs.. 10 days... jeebus...", "Seems a compromise would be for you to only cook vegetarian while guests are there,but for him to be able to eat/cook his own meat dishes.", "YTA \n\nYou don\u2019t eat the meat he prepares for himself. You\u2019re being unreasonable.\n\nWe have a household of 3 different eating moralities and we are all able to respect each other without imposing our beliefs on others.", "Well, it's his HOME. I don't see why he can't cook meat as well as vegetarian entrees and sides.. And both sides get the things they need to eat. It's his home and he should not have to completely stop cooking meat for 10 days.", "NAH but YWTBA if you force this.\n\nYou are married to your husband and clearly accept that he eats meat and this is his home just as much as yours.\n\nNobody would be telling me what I can and cannot eat in my own home.\n\nHypothetical of course but how would you feel if the situation was reversed?", "NTA. Is he this selfish about his own needs in all areas of your marriage? You say you cook meat for him every day? Does he cook vegetarian meals for you? Does he respect the elders of your family as much as he does the elders of his own family? I\u2019m sorry, but he is coming off as a massive AH and I\u2019m sorry you are married to someone who wants to only receive, and not to give.", "YTA. He lives there to. It is his home as well. Your diet, your parents diet, none of that is his problem or his concern. Are your parents going to let him cook meat when he comes over to their home? People need to stop expecting special treatment based on whatever goofy diet they cling to. It is literally no one else's problem but your own. I'd have a barbeque each night they are there just to hammer home that basic point. Stop pushing your crap onto other people. He deserves to be comfortable in his own damn house.", "In his own home he can eat as he pleases. I'm sure he's respectful enough where it counts.", "NAH. Can't he just eat some fast food burgers when he wants meat for 10 days?", "NTA for asking. He's not obligated to keep your request but a good partner will make this reasonable accommodation.", "I would say Y T A but really, let's be honest, he married someone who he knew for a fact will be vegetarian for life, so he had to have known things like this could come up. I don't really agree with making him do that, but I don't know your culture or beliefs, so I can't really judge. So I'm going NTA.", "ESH, don\u2019t fix him separate meals why you family is here, but don\u2019t give home grief if he cooks his own meat dinners while they are here.  You knew when you married him that he ate meat so this might become an issue if your family visits.  If it is that big of issue your family can get a hotel.  He should be able to last that long without meat but he should be allow to eat what he wants in his house.", "If he was Muslim and demanded OP wear hijab while his family was in town you'd be raging.\n\nThese relatives sound kinda snowflake if they demand other people follow their dietary religion wherever they go.", "YTA\n\nYou guys are vegetarian, he is not. It's part of your culture, not part of his. Your relatives need to understand that, when visiting. Just like he can't force you guys to eat meat, you can't force him not to.", "probably gonna get downvoted for this and I\u2019m fine with that but YTA, \n\nrespecting other people\u2019s dietary restrictions and preferences is important but everyone should be able to eat whatever they want to, especially in their own home, you mentioned you\u2019ve adjusted and started making meat for him (you don\u2019t have to btw, you could\u2019ve chosen not to cook any meal including meat for the rest of your life. you can\u2019t call it a sacrifice if you lord it over his head) nobody\u2019s trying to get your relatives to eat meat and trust me the smell won\u2019t kill them, when you go to someone\u2019s house you adjust to them not the other way around, just saying. \n\nThey just can\u2019t complain about what\u2019s in HIS plate, that\u2019s nuts.

Those family members will survive", "YTA\n\nYou're expecting someone to change their habits in their own home for 10 days. Doesn't really matter what the habit is. He lives there and should be able to do what he enjoys and makes him comfortable.", "You are setting up a fight here imo.\n\nWhy are you asking your boyfriend to ban your people from the house.\n\nFeel free to not cook meat for him but if you ask him not to cook or eat meat at home while you have guests you are asking him to get rid of your guests.", "Lol? It's his home too and he should be able to eat what he enjoys. What does your parents diet have anything to do with what your husband eats? It's completely unreasonable.", "YTA: you expect him not to eat his food for 10 days? Im not suggesting that YOU cook it. Is he allowed to cook it for himself? Or, is he allowed to eat meat in the house if he eats it raw or goes out to get it and brings it home? Not eating meat for 10 days is a huge adjustment for someone who is used to eating it. It\u2019s his home, not your relatives. Your relatives can stay somewhere else or adjust to the people who live there.", "How would you feel if he asked you not to cook vegetarian food while his omnivore family visits?\nYTA", "NTA. I\u2019ve been vegetarian for 10+ years and I always LOL when meat eaters get pissy about not being able to have meat for x amount of days. There are many other foods he can eat and if he\u2019s worried about a certain vitamin or mineral, he can get it from plant based items, or even dairy. Lots of people are brainwashed into thinking they can only get meat, b12 from animal protein when things like legumes exist. But really, is going ten days without meat that difficult for him and others??? I honestly don\u2019t get it.", "YTA. You married an omnivore. You know it, they know it. I think it's rude and disrespectful to expect him to change for a10 day visit. A meal? Sure. If he visits them for 10 days will they serve meat?", "YTA\nI wouldn't expect someone to give up meat in their own home just because guests are vegetarian. \n\nMy stepdaughter is vegetarian. We didn't stop eating meat when she visited. I simply made sure her needs were met.", "YTA. If they are not comfortable staying in your home where meat is cooked for the residents there, they can stay somewhere else. It\u2019s not ok to expect someone to change their diet for someone else\u2019s food preference. They are still provided vegetarian meals, they don\u2019t have allergies that require a diet change. \n\nYou can ask and he can decline. Taking it further than that is emotional manipulation and makes you the ah.", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s I\nHis house. He gets to have his life their. \n\nYour guests snd family can accommodate him. Not v v unless he is willing and doesn\u2019t have to be pushed.", "Nta", "Unfortunately YTA.  It\u2019s his home not the relatives.

I was raised vegetarian, and there are some meals I prefer without meat, but people I live with (roommates and partners) think meat is required. They would make it and add it. \n\nI know it's not the same situation, but hopefully an option for you.", "NTA. But I think maybe the bigger cultural difference here is not so much between vegetarian and non vegetarian, as between what is perceived as a reasonable level of hospitality . I'm fortunate in that everyone in my household feels that making guests feel comfortable as much as possible is part of being a good host. If we host people with allergies, we make sure there are no allergens where they are. If we host people with sensitivities to fragrances we remove scented candles and make sure there are unscented bath products available, and sheets and towels are laundered in scent free products. We *want* our guests to enjoy their stay with us. If we didn't, we wouldn't invite them. Sounds like husband doesn't really want her family to visit, so even a small accommodation feels like an imposition to him.", "Nta but you are forcing him to not have meat while your folks visit for 10 days. Perhaps make him meat dishes for lunch.", "YTA it\u2019s his home.", "If your not willing to eat meat when his family visits for 10 days, he should t be given the same rule. Our you kinda are an a hole.", "YTA. If he cooks his own thats his business. U sound like a massive control freak", "Soft YTA I went veggie when I was a teen and it's been about 17 years. I hated handling meat (hated, no, man, I still hate) cooking it, and most particularly not knowing if I am doing it properly. But I work with kids and their diets mean they eat meat so I chose to learn to cook meat so I could cook it for them. Again, I chose to cook for them. They're, mostly, big enough and daft enough to do it themselves, or there are other people around who can do it, but the thing about that choice is I made it so I can't hold it against them. \n\nYour family know he eats meat so I'm sure they know there will be meat in the home and they have chosen to stay anyway. Do what you can to reduce the smell - open windows, using sprays, burn candles - but I think expecting him to repay a favour he didn't ask you for is too much. I know A LOT of people who would be lost without meat in their diet and even I take issues with some veggie food and I'm supposed to be used to it after all this time.", "I\u2019d be cooking a ribeye in the kitchen the second they show up. They can adjust or stay at a hotel", "YTA and I say that delicately.  They know he eats meat, they've been around cooked meat unless they live exclusively in a location where all of the grocery stores, food stalls, and restaurants are vegetarian.  You knew he ate meat before you married him and are asking him to change his own culture to suit yours.  That said, if he went to your family's house, I'd expect him not to bring meat into a vegetarian's house.  You can both compromise by say having meat every other night as part of just his dinner.  It wouldn't kill him to eat vegetarian, but if he objects, I get it.", "NDA, but your husbandd is a giant one\n\nYTA-guys, you are so pathetic. She is doing him a favor all year and he cant do such a small thing for a few days. It's literally super easy and non-restrictive to not eat meat for a few days. If you cant do that, you should probably visit a doctor bc what you do to your body on a regular basis is not healthy at all.", "YTA\n\nSo, you make a \"sacrifice\" for him by cooking him meals he likes?\n\nHow sweet and romantic.

If anything what you're asking is even more egregious because you're asking someone to disregard rationality in favor of dietary relics of the Late Stone Age (in the case of Abrahamic religions).  \n\nNo one is entitled to any sort of religious accommodation from a private individual in public, especially not in his/her own home.", "[deleted]", "You\u2019re right, he isn\u2019t. But to go cold turkey on meat for 10 days is tough. I\u2019d have to prepare for this way in advance. I wouldn\u2019t even know how to sustain myself for 10 days without meat. I know I for sure die without carbs.", "I have been reading OP\u2019s comments (and I realize not everyone has had a chance to do that yet), so I see where she says cooking meat for her husband has never been an issue for her, until now. With the added context, what she is asking of him is incredibly small, and his refusal to even *attempt* to accommodate her request shows how very inconsiderate and selfish he really is.", "It's wild how you're twisting this. People get so weird when vegetarians or vegans are brought up. I'm not gonna explain it again, you're just being willfully ignorant at this point", "In either instance, she would be doing something she made clear she doesn't want to do because she knows he will react poorly if he doesn't get his way.", "He doesn't cook for himself to begin with. OP says in her comments that she does all the cooking.", "I mean, you don't get to pick what they put after your name on this sub. At any rate, what did I miss in my reading of this post?", ">I requested my husband to not have ***us*** cook meat i\n\n\"Us\", not \"me\".  She's asking him not to as well.", "[removed]", "Ten days, 30 meals, is a minor sacrifice?

She gets no say in anything?", "OP says in her comments that he is unwilling to do this for her. He's also clearly being uncooperative by telling her that she's \"forcing\" this on him, as it sounds like he's trying to make her feel guilty and like she's the bad guy for making a simple request.", "I mean, taking a hard like of \"I will never alter my behaviour, even temporarily, because of someone else's religion\" is absolutely your choice. It's OP's choice as well. I just think it makes him an asshole. \n\nJust to point out, though, nothing is stopping the dude from eating meat outside the house during the ten days his wife's family is visiting. It's not as though he's been completely banned from eating meat. OP is asking that it not be cooked in the house.", "Having principles doesn't make you an asshole; having a principle that is specifically rejecting religious accommodation, *even when* you would be willing to make that accommodation otherwise, is what makes that behavior enter asshole territory. If you are willing to eat a vegetarian dish if asked, but *unwilling* to do so once you find out it's because the person practices vegetarianism religiously, your principle is simply reflexive hostility to religion rather than any actual beliefs of your own.\n\n> No one is entitled to any sort of religious accommodation from a private individual in public, especially not in his/her own home.\n\nThis is also literally untrue in the United States. As I noted, private individuals are required to accommodate religion in employment, provided that accommodation does not present an undue burden. Rejecting an accommodation purely on the grounds that it's a religious one would be considered overt bigotry. There are some places in the world, most notably France, that follow this sort of militant secularist mindset, but it is not how the law is set up in the United States.\n\nYes, there is no *obligation* for OP's husband to accommodate their religion, but it is also not a huge ask to not cook meat in the household for 10 days, and based on OP's comments, it's *definitely* not a huge ask for him to be OK with his wife cooking vegetarian for 10 days, especially when OP is already accommodating his diet almost all of the time.\n\nE: Part of the difference of opinion here is that I do not view accepting a request borne out of religious practice to be conforming, practicing, or endorsing their religion, at least not universally. I can politely follow it not because I magically agree with e.g. Hinduism, but because my interest in being an accommodating guest or host or friend aligns and lack of strong preferences otherwise aligns with accommodating a request. If you view accommodating those sorts of requests as *fundamentally* having religion imposed on you, no matter the circumstances, then obviously you'd feel differently than I do, but that seems like a needlessly hostile and oppositional way to view the world, and I'm saying this as somebody who doesn't practice religion.", ">No one is entitled to any sort of religious accommodation from a private individual in public, especially not in his/her own home.\n\nMaybe, but someone can definitely still be an asshole by not being accommodating.\n\nThat doesn't mean following another person's religion, but it does mean allowing them to follow theirs, which can include aspects of the environment when the requests are temporary ones that don't cause harm to you or others. \n\nE.g. \"please don't eat X around me\" is a reasonable request that it is asshole-ish to not honour, \"please don't eat X ever\" or \"please don't be gay around me\" is not (and would be an asshole-ish request to make)", "Yeah, not cook meat in 10 days. He can still order food with meat if he wants to have it.

He's being asked to agree to no meat cooked in the house for a week and a half.

I just think it makes him an asshole.\n\nHm, I'm curious to know more about your thought process.  \n\nThat implies an unmet obligation to conform to someone else's religious views, does it not?   Would you for example forego having ribs and a beer if seated next to a group of Muslims or Orthodox Jews at an event?

Rejecting that control and living one's life by rational guidelines instead of arbitrary cultural artifacts dating back to the Late Stone Age is an AH move only from the religious POV.  Believe in whatever religion you like, but your rights to it end where my nose begins, so to speak.  If you wish accommodation in some manner, persuade me via logic, not mummery.  \n\nIf that makes me an AH in the eyes of some, IDGAF.

That's a personal preference, not a religious taboo; AFAIK believers are only expected not to partake of the food themselves.\n\nIf I'm in an empty, unreserved conference room scrolling on my phone and someone pops in to ask to use it for prayers, I'll happily oblige.  It doesn't really affect me. If someone asks me to skip the ribs and porter plate because a group of Muslims or Orthodox Jews is nearby, forget it.  That's imposing their religion on my choices.", "[deleted]", "Then why the \"us\", if not to preclude him from cooking?", "Can't speak for anyone else but if I'm not intentionally eating a vegetarian diet, I virtually never have a vegetarian meal.", "If it made my SO sick, I'd refrain too, but that's not what we're talking about.  It's not unreasonable to ask him to refrain but neither is it unreasonable for him to decline since it's his house too and he's not subject to their religious/ethical/cultural strictures.", "OP says in her comments that she is the one who does all of the cooking.", "Why is it ok for her husband to dictate what food is cooked in their home but not OP?", "If I was married to one of those hypothetical people and they were asking me to change my habits for a week and a half, not for a lifetime, then yes I would absolutely skip the ribs or beer. There is a significant difference in our obligations to the people we marry and complete strangers. \n\nI like a drink at the end of the day, and I like to get high on Fridays. If my husband and I were hosting his family and they were vehemently against marijuana and alcohol use, I'd skip the rye and coke and save my vape for the next weekend. I would not consider a temporary change to my habits to be such a big deal that I'd make my partner unhappy over it.", "*Most* accommodation is not logical, or at least not justified on logical grounds. That's kind of the point, it's about doing something you wouldn't otherwise as a pro-social action, not because it's in your best interest but making a small sacrifice for somebody else's comfort is *prima facie* good.\n\nAnd yeah, I can understand the anti-theist argument that religion is generally bad, especially when given political power, but I'm also able to divorce that argument from the day-to-day lives of individual religious practitioners and accept their idiosyncratic or illogical behaviors, the same way I accept low-grade idiosyncrasy or seemingly illogical behaviors from anybody else. Accepting that his wife doesn't want to provide him food with meat in it in front of vegetarian guests is just being nice, not \"mummery\" or some illogical betrayal of his individuality in the face of social control.\n\nE: This is also especially weird in the context of vegetarianism, where like, \"late stone age\" religion aside, the secular ethical argument for it is so incredibly and obviously strong that even if you eat meat, as I do, you can't really pretend to have the high ground when rejecting it.", "It would make things easier if OP made it clear, honestly."]}
