Me and my wife have two sons aged 20 and 17 and we are all Christian. For us Christmas day is about god but on boxing day we invite some friends and their kids over and exchange gifts and have done since our boys were little because we don't want them to miss out on Christmas. For the last few years different friends have hosted this boxing day get together and my eldest son has skipped it every time. Me and my wife are fine with this. We usually give him our presents for him when we get home and we'd rather he didn't come than come and be grumpy and bring the mood down. My son isn't a big socialiser, he doesn't have many friends and is quite socially awkward. He does hang out with the friends he does have but he dreads and avoids social occasions. When he was a kid I would make him socialise a bit more but he is an adult so I am not going to force it. \n\nYesterday we hosted at ours because it was our turn. My boys and the other children (all 15 - 25) watched a movie while the grown ups talked but then we all sat round for a chat in a circle and my eldest sat on a chair in the corner on his phone. He wasn't rude or grumpy and he occasionally added things to the conversation but I let him do his own thing as I was having a good time talking to my friends and my son had participated earlier in the night. \n\nOne of our friends texted us today to tell us how rude it was that I let my son sit on his phone instead of entertaining guests. Me and my wife both believe that because our son is an adult we aren't going to force him and he wasn't changed the pleasant atmosphere of the evening or making anyone pay attention to him he was just doing his own thing but a few other friends have chimed in to the conversation agreeing that we don't discipline our son enough. \n\nso AITA for not forcing my 20 year old son to socialise? \n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1703688861, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18s2h09/aita_for_not_forcing_my_20_year_old_son_to/", "score": 243, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would love to know HOW, according to these people, you were supposed to \u201cforce\u201d or \u201cdiscipline\u201d him into acting against his nature. \n\nIf this comes up again, maybe put the ball in their court. Ask them, \u201cOkay, what would *you* do or say to get an adult to socialize when he doesn\u2019t want to? I\u2019m not gonna ground him or take away his phone, so you tell me the magic solution.\u201d", "NTA. I have extended family like your friends. Had your son \u201centertained\u201d them, they still would\u2019ve texted you saying your son needs to stay in a child\u2019s place and not engage in adult conversation despite the fact your son is an adult.", "NTA - but the person who sent you that message sounds like one!", "NTA. I find it asshole like behavior for your friend to be texting you about your son\u2019s behavior when it didn\u2019t hurt anyone.", "ESH\n\n\nEven though it's more and more common in this day and age, it's still rude to be with a group of people and focused on your phone.\n\n\nAt his age, you are correct that you cannot and should not force him to socialize.  But he also shouldn't be rude.\n\n\nSo pick one or the other... Stay inside away from people and do your own thing on your phone.  Or join the other people and put your phone down and talk to them.  But joining them just to ignore them is probably the worst choice of the three.", "Yeah, fuck this person. Who sends a text like that? Forcing a person who is socially anxious to interact more than they want to is the fastest route to that person resenting you. Your son was out and about and socializing, and could very well already have been trying his damndest for your family to be present. Everyone has their own limits. These people want you to \u201cpunish\u201d your son for not faking more smiles and making them feel good about themselves? Imagine what their relationship with their own families is really like. NTA", "NTA. He's a grown man, bot a kid, and you should be careful of the people claiming you don't discipline him enough because they're not very intelligent.", "NTA.

That friend of yours is out of line. Feel free to ignore them.", "lol. NTA. Your friends are entitled and weird. Might be time to re-evaluate that friendship. You don't go into someone else's home and demand that they change how they parent, but that's a rule for people with children. You don't have a child in your home. You have a 20 year old. If your friends felt slighted, they can choose to just accept the slight or talk about it with the 20 year old like grown ass adults. Instead they came to this adult's mommy and daddy to tell on him like he's naughty.   \n\n\nI mean, yes, it's rude to sit on your phone when there are guests over, but as an adult, this is your son's cross to bare, not your's.", "NTA", "NTA.

Thar said, it is considered rude to pay more attention to your phone than to your guests.  Perhaps you could arrange a alternate activity for him next time around?", "NTA \n\nYour adult son was present to his level of comfort. It\u2019s ironic that your friends feel it is acceptable to criticize the parenting of your grown child while breaking the cardinal rule of being rude to the host.  \n\nIf they feel so strongly that your son behaved inappropriately and you were at fault for not forcing him to act differently, it may be time to start a new Boxing Day tradition.", "NTA - those friends aren\u2019t real friends", "NTA. You can't discipline an introvert into socialising. He's an adult, he was present, he engaged a little bit and he wasn't rude to anyone. I can't see how any of that is a problem. If he had autism he probably would have had an anxiew attack if you had tried to force him to engage more.. I think you handled this excellently.", "NTA, I think you are very kind to your son to understand he is an introvert, and to allow him to participate to the degree that he is comfortable.\n\nIt sounds like he was not being rude or disruptive at all. He was participating to the level of his comfort. I think that's great.\n\nIn this day and age, I appreciate parents who understand their kids.", "NTA, your friend is. Your son made himself available to everyone else by not shutting himself up in his room. Your son also participated in the conversation.  That's more than a person old enough to be your son's father should expect from a 20 year old.", "NTA. Did they want him to perform a one man show for them? He was present and added to the conversation. What more did they want?", "NTA. He interacted enough for his own tastes.", "NTA.\n\n> that we don't discipline our son enough.\n\nGosh, what, you don't discipline the 20 year legal adult who was sitting quietly and not bothering anyone? Did they expect you to march over there and confiscated his phone and drag him by the elbow to grudgingly hug and kiss them like so many of us were made to do to relatives and parents' friends as kids?\n\nHe was already intermittently contributing. They also aren't his friends, they're your friends. If they wanted him to socialize more they could engage with him themselves.", "NTA. What you stated should be exactly what you text back to your friend.\n\nDear Friend, my son is an adult and not much on socializing so he can choose when and whom to do so with in his home.", "NTA. This is why neurodivergent people are so stressed out by neurotypical people.", "NTA.  Entertain guests?  Did they want him to put on a show and do routines?  People are different, not everybody likes to socialize as much as others.  Your son could have stayed in his room or he could have left, but he was with everyone else, just not as social.  How would you force him to be social anyway?  Did the asshole that texted you give you any tips or requests?  Who does this person think they are anyway?", "NTA\n\nThey should really learn the difference between personality and education.", "YTA for allowing these \u201cfriends\u201d to say anything about your son. \nWhat probably occurred is their kids pointed out that you were not \u201charassing and forcing\u201d your son to interact. So those parents are taking it out on you. \nI have a 20 year old exactly like your son. \nThe first and ONLY time someone dared to criticize or say something about his being so reserved I told them they had a choice not to hang out with my family but that I wasn\u2019t going to ask my son to be a performing monkey. \n\nShut that crap now.

Next time they text about your son, tell them  since he's an adult and you can't and won't force him to interact with them, and you sure as hell aren't disciplining a 20yr old, there're nothing to discuss. It's weird they want to be entertained by a 20yr old in the first place. Keep up the great work with your kids, there's nothing wrong with him being reserved and introverted.", "NTA.  Your son is an adult and has no obligation to pretend to be something he isn\u2019t for other people.", "NTA. My partner and I are both introverts; we like being social but definitely have our limits. We grew up in families who forced socialization (thinking it was somehow better for us) and it was awful! It sounds like your son was genuinely being social within his level of comfort. I'm glad you respect that. Your guests need to learn to do the same. \n\n\nWe do enjoy hosting family events now, but are very clear with all of our guests that there's a basement downstairs for quiet and solitude for anyone who needs it, including us.", "NTA at all, your son doesn\u2019t need to be an extrovert, and how exactly are your so-called friends suggesting you discipline a 20 year old?", "Your son is a grown adult. Ita not your place to discipline him if he doesnt socialize. The people who tried to turn it back on you are out of line. Who cares if he sat in the corner the whole night? He was there. He didnt hide in his room. Are they upset because he didnt talk to them specifically? Perhaps encourage them to reach directly out to your son if they want more of a connection. Something tells me he does better with 1 on 1 conversations anyways.", "NTA. \n\nIntroversion is not a character flaw and you allow your child to be who he is.", "He\u2019s looking for apts on line to move out and get a life. Talk about smothering and extremely boring life. \ud83d\ude12", "NTA\n\nHe is clearly pretty introverted. You let him participate to the level of his own comfort. He wasn't particularly rude, he did at least make the effort to be present. It's not rude to be quiet, whatever much some extraverts think. It is your guests who were rude, expecting him to \"perform\" in his own home where they were guests.", "nta - what is rude is guests complaining and giving opinions regarding your son that nobody asked for.  perhaps less about you and your family and more about manners and etiquette on their part might be a good idea.", "NTA. \n\nI personally believe using my phone in a social setting is rude, but I apply that rule to only myself. \n\nIt probably took a lot out of him to even be there, passively listening and just being there. People are draining as hell and if your friend is this brash with their texts, they\u2019re probably exhausting to be around. \n\nYou were hosting, not your children.", "NTA & you\u2019re parenting beautifully (as a socially awkward adult who was forced to socialise)", "NTA he wasn\u2019t bothering anyone and he\u2019s not a show monkey", "NTA. The likely reason that your son was there at all is because he knew that you wouldn't force him to socialise more than he felt able, and haven't done so since he was u18. If he didn't feel comfortable enough that you wouldn't pressure him or make him feel bad, then he wouldn't have come at all.

I do not think they are AH for simply feeling some kind of way. Feelings are feelings and can't be helped.  I think they are the AH because they aren't handling their feelings like mature people.  If they don't like how you let your son mind his own business in his own home, then maybe they should just not come to your house anymore.

Given the balance of supportive parents, son\u2019s own room to retreat to for breaks, and an hosted at his house, the parents should push the son to interact and practice small talk.", "It\u2019s the parents house not his.    \n\n\nI said spare room in relation to my anxiety. If someone said I was being rude then I\u2019d be hurt. I usually just play simple games or mindlessly scroll Reddit.

Thanks for being proper parents who recognize both their offsprings needs and limits, but also that he's 20. I'm honestly amazed even the 17 year old still participates.\n\nWe used to have something similar and by 15 or 16 we were opting out of multi family friend get togethers. Kids develop their own lives. It's normal. And I'm glad you recognize that, even if your friends don't.", "NTA but what is up with considering 15-25 year olds kids.  They're adults at 18.  They may tolerate it, but highly doubtful the 19-25 year olds have the same interests as the actual kids.", "NTA, honestly he may have some type of social anxiety or something along those lines and despite what redditors may have you believe, they do not in fact have license to give any advice on how to handle your son in this specific situations, and if they \\*did\\* they wouldn't give you blanket advice without first getting to speak to your son first.", "NTA. This is an adult. It\u2019s not your responsibility. Just because he is on his phone doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t engaging \u2026it\u2019s super common for someone with social anxiety to do something else to calm them while still being engaged in the conversation as evidenced by the fact he sometimes contributed.

His comfort and growth and ability to self regulate was way more important than any friend or family member and their idea of what constitutes \u201crude\u201d (hint: it isn\u2019t the young man who sat and interacted in his own way, quietly peacefully).", "NTA but those friends certainly are. Your son was participating to the best of his ability when he could have found a room away from everyone and hidden away until they all left (his own if he lives with you). \n\nSince when is it a parent\u2019s job, or even ok for them, to discipline their child once the kid is an adult? When is it your friends\u2019 job to criticize your parenting? Do you have the kind of relationship where they wouldn\u2019t take offense if you were to say something similar about one of their kids?", "NTA. Why do they need your son to entertain them?  They are your guests, not your son\u2019s. I\u2019d also accuse them of being ungrateful for your hospitality and overstepping their invitation into your home by daring to second guess your relations with your adult son. \n\nI\u2019d shut this down real, real hard.

Your son isn\u2019t a circus monkey, OP, and your friends are not his guests. It would be rude if he invited his own friends over only to ignore them in favor of playing on his phone. Clearly in this situation, he listened in and added commentary where he felt that it would benefit the conversation and stayed silent when he had nothing to add.\n\nWhy do people think they need to be entertained by someone else?

Furthermore, if a grown a$$ adult needs a young person to entertain them, they must not be very interesting to begin with.
