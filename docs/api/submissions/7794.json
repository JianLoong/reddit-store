Even at that price (pretty cheap) it\u2019s an extra addition to an already sky high cost of living nowadays.  \n\nIt\u2019s not rude whatsoever to say \u201cthis is a bit expensive for me\u201d\n\nIf he was a good trainer, who cared, he would have probably seen if you thought you could benefit from twice a month and a written plan to do on your own and cut your cost in half.\n\nHell, I still occasionally do online coaching freelance and usually it\u2019s like 15 a month for a routine.  \n\nIf someone tells me they can\u2019t afford it cause things are tight, I simply respond \u201cI fully understand that.

If you can't afford it, then it is too expensive for you, a professional would know this and move on or let the prospective client move on.", "NTA you didnt say it wasnt a fair price for his service, just that it wasnt in your budget- which is totally fine. better to be upfront than to give him the run around thinking he might get a new client", "NTA. You\u2019re paying for a product or service, you have every right to comment on what it costs.", "NTA. The important thing is you didn't say \"it's not worth that much,\" or some variation of that. You said \"it's too expensive *for me*.\" It wasn't a comment on the value of his work, but rather a comment on your disposable income.", "NTA you were just being honest about your budget. Also $20/session, 4x/month is $80, not $100.", "NTA.

Your coach's math is bad though, $20 a session = $80 a month for 8 of the 12 months, $100 for the last 4.  That's a total of $1040 for the year, not $1200.  If that is what he told you most likely he was getting defensive about getting caught trying to get an extra $160.", "NTA, so long as you were saying it in the context of you not being able to afford it, and not as \" your services aren't worth that\" because $20 a session is pretty darn cheap.", "NTA. He probably just said that as a reaction because he wanted the business.", "NTA. I wanted to say N A H, because paying for one on one coaching is always going to be very expensive , they deserve to be paid decently for their time, experience and equipment. a lot of people just see the price and not what they are really buying which is something of a luxury.\nyou didnt say it was to expensive for what he's offering, you said it's too expensive for you, which is not rude", "NTa\n\n>He then said its rude to say it so straight to his face.\n\n\"Where should I have said it?\"\n\nor if he is a bad boxing coach\n\n\"Turn around and bend over and I'll try again.\"", "Info: what did you expect to pay?", "Maths are off, he's 20$ above what he said.

What in the world is this guy's problem? It's not rude at all to say it's too expensive to his face; why would it be? It's best to be straight-forward in these matters.

You were just saying that you couldn't afford it. nothing wrong with that.", "NTA - Yeah $20/hour is a good price if the guy is any good, but you're under no obligation to agree to it. If I were him, I'd rather have you tell me the truth rather than come up with some dumb excuse.

Second, when training someone honesty is paramount, and that goes both ways. If it's too expensive - then that's that. Maybe work something out if possible. As long as noone is impolite or rude, it's completely acceptable.", "THIS!!!", "100 dollars for a 4x a month boxing class is a complete rip off.
