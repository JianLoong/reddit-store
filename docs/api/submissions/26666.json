As I stated, we do get along and I have helped him with issues in the past by listening, giving advice when asked, giving support, helping him talk to his father, and stuff like that. More like a friend than a mother figure. For as long as I've been involved with my husband, his son has had minimal involvement with his mother.\n\nHis wedding is in a few months. I couldn't be happier for him and his fiancee. He and my husband were discussing the wedding over the weekend. His fiancee will be doing a father/daughter dance and he asked me to do a mother/son dance with him. Admittedly I froze up for a moment because I was not expecting that. We just don't have that kind of relationship and I was unaware he saw it otherwise. I declined by saying I was honored he'd ask but that I thought it might be inappropriate and suggested that he could try asking his grandmother. He seemed to accept my answer but came off neutral over it. \n\nLast night my husband brought it up again and said he was a bit disappointed in me and that his son is pretty hurt by it but neither wants to push the issue. I feel bad for upsetting his son but at the same time I still feel like it'd be inappropriate to do the dance because I'm not his mother. I've never had a maternal role in his life.

It's just a fucking dance, and you basically chose to damage your relationship because you are offended by an implied title. I have the feeling this is about the ages involved and you not wanting to appear old enough to be his bio mom, rather than the quality of your relationship, but ... problem solved.

It'll be insincere if you agree to dance with him at this point and he deserves much better than that on his wedding day. He obviously thinks of you as a mother figure. Poor guy. I think it's really good that you set these boundaries now so that he can make sure to keep his future kids from getting to know you too well.", "Inappropriate how? There's nothing inappropriate about a stepson trying to build parental bonds with a step-parent.\n\nI certainly think a step-parent who joins the family when children are already adults does not have the same duty that they would have if they came in when the children were still minors. But not having a duty to fill a parental role with a 28 year old stepson doesn't make it inappropriate to have a mother-son dance at a wedding.\n\nAnd from what it sounds like, his bio mom wasn't even there for him to dance with. (Is bio mom even in the picture?)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA\n\nI don't know how much. You say you haven't had a maternal role with him, but you don't say you never want one. You don't say you hate dancing or have some kind of anxiety issue that would have made it a great burden. It obviously mattered to him. It reads like he has in general tried to form mother-son ties with you. Bio mom absented herself. Sounds like he doesn't have anyone in a maternal role and possibly hasn't had anyone in it since he was a young kid.", "YTA.  I'm only 9 years older than my eldest stepchild and I would have been honored to dance a mother/son dance with him at his wedding (fortunately his mother is very present in his life + we danced to a different song).

It doesn\u00b4t matter what your relationship with him is, it\u00b4s a package deal. You not feeling maternal to him is irrelevant, you thinking or feeling what your role is or should be is irrelevant, this is the life you married into. For better and for worse, right? All the good and the bad bits, and as much as you may dislike it, this is also a part of it.  \n\n\nNow it seems like you have a pretty decent relationship, so I am sure you don\u00b4t mean bad, but he expressed his wish to you, he wants you there as his mother figure, and because of what exactly do you feel that is inappropriate? It\u00b4s a celebration of love, a celebration of a union between two people, and his request to you fits that exactly.  \n\n\nThe fact that your husband also seems upset about it, shows me it\u00b4s important to him too.  \n\n\nI think you are too worried about what \"public opinion\" may think of it, than being there for your step son and being there for your husband. You have your role to play, that\u00b4s part of the package deal... so play it, or be called an AH.", "I'm going to vote YTA mostly because I don't think you fully considered the request before rejecting it -- and please really consider that it was a rejection. \n\nThis can be a really big deal to people who are the kids in a blended family, giving some sort of formal, public gesture to the stepparent, and then facing having that stepparent turn it down. He's 28, so you're at least not in the company of the people telling 9 year old kids they don't want to be called Dad, but it does feel like he isn't one of the people whose feelings you are most concerned about here, and I think you need to look at why that is. \n\nMy stepmother was only 9 years older than me. I get how it's different from someone who is physically old enough to have been your mother. I do feel for your stepson, because I think he was trying to acknowledge you as a part of your family -- and because it sounds like he's already had a mother figure reject him. He doesn't have a deep well of mothers to choose from, but he chose you and even if you can't bring yourself to do this dance for whatever your reasons are, I hope you really address the fact that you rejected the overature so that you guys can move past this.", "YTA  here is what you are missing.  your stepson even thou he understood you are not his mother he viewed you as his stepmother and loves and respects you for that and also views u really as his mom as you were there in his life.  age is just a number by the way.", "Why is it inappropriate?\n\nWith whose feelings, other than those of your stepson, are you concerned?\n\nYou don't have to want to do it. But from the moment he asked you it stopped being inappropriate.\n\nYTA for the reason you provided.", "NAH, although you are clearly missing that you do have a maternal role in his life, one that he sees, and values. I would dance with him. Take it as the honor he and your husband mean to confer.", "YTA for telling him it was inappropriate.\n\nAll this dance means is that he wants to honor you at his wedding. It\u2019s also a way to honor both you *and* your husband - you two raised him together as partners, and showing you how means that means to him is also a way to show his father. \n\nPerhaps the request was more about not wanting to be singled out - he may feel like his fianc\u00e9e having a father/daughter dance without him having the equivalent will highlight his lack of a mother/son relationship. \n\nAnd yet you are still the closest thing he has to a mother. Isn\u2019t that enough?\n\nI\u2019m not sure what exactly you meant by inappropriate. I\u2019ll be generous and assume you meant because you don\u2019t literally fit the role of \u201cmother.\u201d However, your stepson is aware of your relationship. He knows what he calls you and I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s not mom. He\u2019s likely not thinking of the literal word.\n\nBecause of that your use of \u201cinappropriate\u201d could be interpreted in many different ways. Your stepson may think you believe any affection he has for you is inappropriate because he should feel anything towards you. He may think it\u2019s because you don\u2019t see him in as an important person in your life and are confused why he would think you\u2019d want to support him on his wedding day. He may think you are implying something darker and more untoward, or have the more innocent but still problematic take that you are worried people may think you look like a couple of you two dance together.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a big deal. You made it one. Please talk to your stepson, ideally with other ideas of how you\u2019d like to be a part of his big day.", "You\u2019re not TAH. You explained perfectly well why you turned it down. His disappointment is somewhat understandable but also seems weird-due to ages and relationship as you\u2019ve outlined it. He will be ok and this will smooth over. His grandmother is the best stand in.", "YTA way to hurt a kid and then blame him. He offered because he sees you as a maternal figure. This isn\u2019t about you and it\u2019s weird to draw a line in the sand about it. I hope you get ready for always being on the outside since you rejected him so harshly", "Mild YTA for saying it would be inappropriate, it wouldn't be. I don't want to call you an AH because this is just more of a relationship advice question, but this is the sub we're in. I would say N A H, but I think an apology for not considering the offer more kindly is in order first.\n\nI'm curious about his mother, I take it she's not in the picture?\n\nYou're totally allowed to say no to his request, but making it about perceptions of what might be appropriate is the wrong way to go about this.\n\nI think you're taking an impersonal approach and that's what offends your family.\n\nYou are the closest thing to a mother he has, he asked you. You would be a fine placeholder and it would be doing him a favor, since his fiance wants the dance and it might be noticeable if he wasn't doing it (if only to him.)\n\nGrandma is a fine placeholder too, but he chose you and probably put thought and consideration into that choice. Then you dismissed that choice in a way that makes it seem like he *didn't* put thought into it. \n\nThis was an opportunity to grow closer in the future and to gain a son, and it kinda went over your head. \n\nIf you don't want to do the dance, come up with a more polite reason to decline and apologize. \"Sorry I immediately jumped to suggesting you ask grandma, I just wouldn't like that much attention and I didn't know how to react. That's very sweet of you for asking.\"\n\nIf you do want to do the dance based on replies here, you could probably still salvage the offer, with almost the same apology as above. \n\nFor some background, my dad was a piece of garbage and I've always thought my brother or uncle would walk me down the aisle and dance with me, even though they didn't raise me. It's just about playing our parts in silly traditions for fun and to build connections.", "This is a NAH situation if ever there was one\n\nI think the friendly chats meant more to him that you realise though", "YTA! It was an innocent request. Your step-son clearly views you as an important figure in his life and if anything you should be grateful that you hold such an important place in his life. You have burnt a lot of bridges with this action of yours and the sooner you try and make amends, the better it is.", "INFO: how long did he live at home after you came into the picture? You married his dad when he was 18, but how long did you know him before that? \n\nI do find it kind of odd that he was basically fully grown when you met him, so I get the lack of a mother/son bond, but now he seems to think you do have that bond??? Did this come out of left field or has he always treated you like a mother figure?", "NAH, I actually think that\u2019s valid. You clearly have cared about him and been there when he needed it, but you were not his mother. He seems to have some maternal feelings around you, but you don\u2019t have them for him. Which is fine. As long as you reiterate your love and that you\u2019ll be there all the same to support him and continue to support him, I think things should be ok. \n\nYou still showed him compassion and support when it mattered, but I think your feelings are valid. But his are too. Maybe this could give you a different perspective on what a mother figure can mean to someone.  But it\u2019s up to you", "YTA. Think about how the wedding will go: \n\nDJ announces Daddy/Daughter dance and has everyone clear the floor. Then\u2026..nothing, and it goes back to everyone doing their own thing.

I am in a similar situation but my bond with my partner's children is still strong and valid, just not parental. Explain this to both of them. NTA.", "YTA absolutely! You\u2019ve been his stepMOM for 10 YEARS. Maybe you don\u2019t feel like a maternal figure in his life because of the age difference but he seems to think of you as one!

You don't consider him a son. However, he considers you a maternal figure. Age differences aside, you've been there and have filled that role in his life for a decade. He simply wanted to acknowledge that and your importance.  You've pretty much spit in his face and said, \"nah\". He's not only hurt, but you've done some damage to your relationship.", "NTA nobody can force you to do anything but id rethink this because it might damage the relationship going forward. Just take one for the team and dance with him. I'm sure he'll appreciate it", "NAH, not sure when you entered his life but it seems you didn\u2019t raise him so I don\u2019t think you are out of line.", "NAH.\nDid you explain to them the same way you laid it out here?\n\nBoth positions sound reasonable.  Is he involved with his grandmother at all?", "YTA unfortunately. It sounds like you could work on your emotional intelligence. It is a beautiful thing that your stepson wants to celebrate and acknowledge the role you\u2019ve played in his life. He\u2019d have some pretty serious rejection/abandonment wounds from his mother and you kinda did it again. Marrying into anyone\u2019s family carries responsibilities, even when they\u2019re almost grown. If you can see the error of your ways you could acknowledge you got it wrong and didn\u2019t recognise how important it was to him, that his happiness is important to you and if it makes him happy of course you\u2019ll do it. It\u2019s okay that you felt awkward because he has a mother, but you can also respect his wishes to have the wedding day he wants. The fact you\u2019re only 9 years apart could be considered a fun family quirk! You could turn this into a good thing by letting him know you care and you are sorry for hurting him. It\u2019ll let him know you really do care and honestly, there\u2019s nothing to feel awkward about - it\u2019s an insecurity you need to address.", "NTA.

He may forgive this but he won't forget it. \n\nI remember when I asked my MIL to go dress shopping with me and she told me we just weren't that close...

You don't want people to see you as a \"mother\" to a 28yr old. \n\nYou've been in his life for 10yrs for god's sake. \nI hope your vanity is worth a damaged relationship with your Stepson. \n\nDon't forget to remind him his future kids must refer to you as Grandpa's wife.. you're FARRR too young to be a REAL Grandma.  Duh. Can't have people thinking you're old now, can we?", "YTA. How hard is it to dance with someone you like & respect. If he didn't see you as a mother figure, he would not have asked. He's not asking too much.", "YTA\nJFC he's not going to make you take him home after", "What age was he when you met him? \n\nYTA.", "OP, you are a snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.  You are the female mentor in his life.  He appreciates you.  \n\nTell him you were feeling badly about stepping in and you felt you didn\u2019t deserve the honor.  You were surprised by it, you didn\u2019t think you did that much for him!  Make it about your insecurities.  Call it imposter syndrome.  (It actually might be).  Apologize.  Ask if you still can do it. Say how honored you feel. (You sound like you do feel honored and are uncomfortable with that emotion).  Also suggest that his grandma also might like to take half of the dance, if he would like to include her.", "this is weird. after 10 years you\u2019re confused  about the nature of your relationship with your stepson?", "Is his mother going to be there, and you feel she might be upset?", "YTA, he choose you over his bio mom for this (which TBH we don\u2019t know anything) and you refused", "YTA.", "YTA, i get that the age gap isn\u2019t very wide but the guy has minimal contact with his mother and you\u2019ve been apart of his life for a decade. The guy honored you by asking you to be his dance partner for a very special moment bc YOU have been there to support him as family. He may not see you as a mother either but he loves and respects you enough to want YOU to share in that moment. There are women who don\u2019t have dad\u2019s who dance with the male family member they\u2019re closest with and men who don\u2019t have mothers that dance with the female they are closest with.", "I\u2019m really sad for your STEPSON. Jesus lady, what\u2019s wrong with you. I\u2019m really not trying to think of you as a giant jerk because you\u2019ve obviously done something something right that this kid love/respects you enough to ask you for something pretty significant. I have a horrible feeling that you might have hurt whatever relationship you had with him over your insensitivity. \n\nIf possible, I think you should do whatever you can to talk to him about it and tell him that you really want to do the dance, even if you don\u2019t want to. Lie and tell him you were just thinking of other family members and didn\u2019t want to step on anyones toes.", "YTA. He wants to honor you as someone important in his life. There\u2019s nothing inappropriate about that, especially because you are in fact his stepmother. (And many, many brothers & friends have done father/daughter dances with brides. Technically not the father & not a paternal-type relationship, but still lovely.)\n\nI\u2019m sure he thought it would be meaningful for you, & I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s not. It\u2019s completely understandable that he\u2019s hurt.", "You should feel honored and should have said yes.", "YTA. \n\nWhat is inappropriate?\n\nYou've been there for him numerous times over the years playing the role a stepmother/mother plays FFS.\n\nIt's his wedding. \n\nYou can't dance with him for about 3 minutes?\n\nWhat weird crap are you putting onto this that you think it's weird?", "YTA. I mean, you have been a role model and parental figure in this kids life for 10 years. I genuinely don\u2019t understand how you would feel it would be inappropriate. You married a man with a kid. That kid becomes your kid too. It\u2019s kind of weird that for 10 years you never accepted your husbands son as your son. Honestly, if I was your husband that would have been a red flag for me in the beginning.", "Soft YTA but I think because there is clearly a miscommunication or bad interpretation of roles. \n\nYou don't see him as a son or stepson but he clearly sees you as a mother role in his life. 106years is enough for him to create this bond and probably the reason he went to you for help and such. \n\nYou should probably sit down with him and kindly tell him that the only reason that you said no was because you didnt want to step on any blood family toes or something. Spare him from knowing you dont see him as a son. Consider accepting since it clearly is important to him and he clearly considers you important enough to him to share this.", "NAH, but it would be kind to dance with him. His fiance wants a daddy/daughter dance,  and generally,  there's a son/mother dance at the same time. He just didn't want to be embarrassed or feel sad on his wedding day that his mom isn't around. \n\nIt would be kind to tell him that he had caught you off guard earlier,  but would be honored to dance with him. It's just a kindness and a nice gesture for someone your husband loves dearly.", "I guess get the not seeing him as a son bc of the age difference as I have a similar situation but he asked you to do it. He didn't have to at all so obviously it meant something to him. I also get not being prepared for that but I would go back to him and explain yourself and ask him if he'd be willing to still do it with you. That's the only way I see this turning out OK in the end. Good luck!", "YTA, but only a little.  I hope you don\u2019t except to be invited to special events when they have children.  You are free to say no to a dance, but they are also free say no to to any contact with future grandchildren.", "Omg what is wrong with  you? YT gigantic A. He offered you a dance of honor as his mother figure. Ever think that maybe he felt bad that he didn\u2019t have a mother figure to do a dance with but felt lucky he had you? And then you made it worse by saying no. Who cares what age anyone is\u2026 apparently you. Shame on you!", "You were a mother figure for 10 years!!! He obviously cares so much for you as he would come to you for advise and guidance. Which are things a mother would do!\n\nAre you just so self centered that you are going to ruin this beautiful moment because of your age??  \n\nSomeone has some serious issues and it\u2019s not the stepson. You are so very the AH!", "YTA. It\u2019s a dance. He wants to honor your role in his life. Dance with him.", "YTA", "I'm going to go against the grain and say NTA.  I get why you don't feel like a mother to him.  He was 18, a legal adult, when you married his father.  I wouldn't view myself as a mother in that situation either.  I'm torn between thinking he views your relationship very differently than you and he just wants to balance out the father -daughter dance with a mother -son dance.  Either way it was fine to say no.  I like that you suggested he ask his grandmother instead.  What I'm not happy about, and where I think the son was hurt, is when you said it was inappropriate for you to have a mother -son dance with you.  It's not inappropriate.  You just don't feel you have a mother -son relationship and declined for this reason.  If you haven't you should apologize for calling it inappropriate and offer to explain why you declined.", "NTA. You both have to agree for this to happen. If he\u2019s old enough to marry, he\u2019s old enough to accept how you feel.", "NTA he doesn\u2019t have to see you as a parent, and if he didn\u2019t, people would be upset with you for pushing him to see you that way. It goes both ways. No one says to step kids \u201cit\u2019s just a dance\u201d Reddit just hates stepparents with reasonable boundaries \n\nYou don\u2019t have to pretend to be okay with something just because the person you married has a kid. He wasn\u2019t the AH for asking, your husband is the AH if he doesn\u2019t drop it.", "He clearly sees you as a mother figure, take a moment and think about this - *he* wants it, your stepson lives and respects you to such a degree as to want to show the world he sees *you* as his mother. \n\nSoft YTA, please reconsider.", "Wow, I'm not going say YTA...**BUT**, why would you say no?  It's just a dance, a few minutes in time, so not asking too much from you but obviously meaningful to him.  I'm sorry to say, it just seems cruel that you turned down your stepson's request.\n\nPersonally I would have felt touched and honored to be asked.", "YTA.. he clearly looks up to you", "NAH. Honestly I would have assumed he was only asking out of politeness or something. You explain in the comments that upon marriage he asked you not be a mum in his life and he calls you either your name or dad\u2019s wife. It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019d assume that as you age this role would become more cemented as you became ages that are more on equal footing. \n\nYou felt it would be odd because it\u2019s a dance reserved for a relationship you feel like you don\u2019t have. People saying that of course the vague interactions you described are maternal are odd. I have coworkers with older age gaps than you two and besides them not knowing my father they do all the same for me, just because they are an older woman does not make our relationship maternal.", "YTA what do you lose from taking 4 minutes out of your life? This is a meaningful request with minimal effort to accomodate. \n\nYou can still fix this if you want to.", "YTA \n\nThere's more to being a mother than giving birth.  You listen, give advice, help communicating with his dad, and probably a host of other things while he lived with you both. \n\nHim asking you was a sign of respect. Him wanting you to dance with him was him showing you his love and mutual respect for all that you've given and done over the years. \n\nYou need to talk with him. There's obviously more missing than you've thought about. Don't throw this away. It's hard to get back.", "YTA \n\nHe doesn\u2019t see his mother. You play that role. \n\nTalk about being an asshole and crushing someone", "Yeah YTA, you should be honored to have been asked and accepted the offer.", "Right? Ignoring the fact she literally is his stepmother, she then lists off things a mother / stepmother would do, then acts shocked. This is about her age vs his age AKA OP's vanity.", "My thoughts exactly! I\u2019m a stepmom and my stepson feels I\u2019m more of a mother to him than his ever was. He calls me, not his mother on Mother\u2019s Day. I\u2019ve never tried to take her place, I\u2019ve encouraged him to have a relationship with her and I\u2019ve told him it\u2019s ok to call her but he gets to set the boundaries now that he\u2019s grown. I can almost guarantee that he\u2019ll ask me for this dance when he gets married and I would be honored to do it.", "Exactly.", "I don\u2019t really see how this is different than a step kid not seeing the stepparent as an actual parent, and refusing to do a dance with them. If the roles were reverse and she saw him as a son and was upset he didn\u2019t ask her for a dance, not a single person would tell him just to suck it up.", "She thinks its inappropriate because she's afraid people might actually think she's old enough to be his mother, I bet.", "She might actually like him\u2026 like THAT.", "She can still do it. Just apologize and explain that she was shocked in the moment and assumed he was asking out of politeness. After talking to Dad she realized that she misread the situation and is beyond honored and touched that he genuinely chose her to stand-in the mom role. \n\nObviously, this should be altered depending on the exact response she gave, but claiming surprise and a misreading of a situation can often work to smooth these things over.", "idk it would probably feel really insincere for the stepson at this point if OP suddenly calls back and says that she\u00b4ll do it. OP would need to be really good with words to not make it wound like a pity-dance.", "This, but alter it slightly. Explain that she thought he asked out of obligation, and that now that she realizes it was a genuine ask she\u2019d be honored!", "He was already 18 when they met and she was 27 - he was never a mother to her, he was no more a kid.", "They just need to have a good talk about how their relationship has grown. And about some of her insecurities. If she's much younger than her husband.... there could be some extended family drama too, that he might want to avoid. (Theres a couple in my family with a 20 year age gap, they've been together for almost 30 years, and family members still make snipey remarks)", "Exactly. There's been a LOT of divorce in my family, so I've seen this go all kinds of ways. Some cousins danced with both parent and step, others picked just one.", "He was 18 when they met.", "*am a stepmother, who has gone to hell and back with my stepchild, and you have a stepchild who asked you to dance with him on his wedding day, who wants you to be a part of your special day? Who doesn\u2019t treat you like shit, and you said No?*\n\nWere they minors when they entered your life?\n\nThis 'child' was legally an adult when his step mother married his dad.  That's different than if he was 5", "That's irrelevant. I didn't even live in the same state as my stepson, but was honored to be asked.", "Would you say that the comments to your post have opened up your eyes and helped you see a different perspective?", "YOU may not have felt it, but he seems to have. Do you not want to dance with him? It seems like he would like that from you.", "do you understand how many step parents would kill to have a relationship with their step children like you have with yours?", "Honestly, it\u2019s a huge honor to you to be asked and that he thinks of you as such an important person in his life. Please reconsider, say yes, dance with him, thank him for the honor.", ">This is about OP's vanity.\n\nThere I fixed it for you.", "Can you believe it?  She sounds so vain.  She alluded to the age thing a couple of times!  Sh*t, get over yourself!", "It is sad she would deny such a touching honor, and a mere dance is all he asks.  I thought this would be about being a self conscious dancer but instead it is another vanity, she is too young to be his mother!  So what?  This is part of being a step mother.  People sure get strange around weddings.", "I would in her position tbh. No 37 year old wants to be aged like that!", "So true.", "You were happy to do so.  You were comfortable in stepping in.   That's the difference.   \n\nStepson was fine to ask.   Stepmother is fine to decline.", "My gosh YTA. Feelings change. What he felt then is not what he feels now after all you\u2019ve done for him. He now clearly sees you as a important/maybe even mother, figure otherwise he wouldn\u2019t have asked you! \n\nWTF lady!", "Don't ask him if/when he changed his mind/feelings about you as a mother. & ignore the name of the dance since it's only a name. If you're not against dancing with family, then this shouldn't be the big thing you're making it out to be. Also, you're his stepmom, which everyone knows making it not inappropriate to have a mother-son dance with him. He's wanting to honor you for the role you've played in his life which obviously means a lot to him or he wouldn't have asked or been upset by your response. \n\nYTA & overthinking things. You also *have* played the mother role for him even if you haven't gone by the title. The things you've listed & that little pouty lip you noticed are all things mothers/parents do & notice. \n\nDance with him like you would if there wasn't a title for the dance since it's okay & not changing anything. Clearly he cares a lot about you & you care for him. Stop making this bigger than it is. Maybe suggest sharing the dance between both you & his grandma since you *both* have played a role in his life to make everyone happy.", "Did you panic when he asked and worry that you were overstepping? If that's the case, take him out for coffee and tell him that. Tell him all the nice things you're telling us about your relationship and that you were just worried it was presumptive of you to accept. \n\nIf your concern is that you don't want to be seen as the mother of a grown man, tough. You married someone with a older kid, you are the stepmother to a fully grown man. I'm going to hope your reaction was the first reason.", "I fully agree with this take. \nDoes he call her mom? Has the soon to be DIL invited step mom to fittings, cake tastings, etc? If I was in OP\u2019s shoes, I\u2019d probably be thinking that he would ask the Grandma. From the story, she maybe entered into his life in his late teens. \nSo OP, NTA. \nHowever, isn\u2019t wonderful that this young man sees you this way and wants everybody to know it? Not everybody is comfortable with this type of display of emotion and love but I do wish that that this story ends with you dancing with your stepson. Kingsdaughter613 has given you the playbook.", "Maybe. I think he deserves better. Maybe his grandma will say yes the first time.", "Just say she thought it was an obligatory ask and now that she realizes it was genuine she\u2019d be happy to do it.", "Well everyone is different right. OP should call 6 right now, and have the same conversation with him that she is having with all of us. Her comments are super down voted, but I think they are legit (only read a couple) . They had a rocky start with the age closeness. They had a conversation about her not just stepping in as his mom, at his request. She genuinely seems to care about him. They should just have a good heart to heart.", "No he was 18 when she married his dad, presumably they met before the wedding", "I guess you're right. NAH the stepson can't be held at fault for feeling hurt", "You understand how what you plan to say also makes you an asshole, right?", ">\" please don't try acting like a mom\" to asking to do a mother/son dance. \n\nwow, asking that wold double your asshole status OP. \n\nNow it sounds you you're holding something over him he said as a teenager? \n\nYou obviously built up a good relationship to the point he asked this and now you want to  continue to spit on it... that doesn't belong in a sincere apology.", "It has been 10 years, feelings change.", "And yet he asked YOU. That means he sees you as a mother figure and you should have been honored instead of shutting him down", "Cool. Happy for you. You and your stepson can have whatever titles you want.  In the loosest sense, a mother is a female who raises a child. I\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t define it differently but I am saying OP is NOT an asshole for feeling how she does.", "No silly, they'll desperately latch onto the one comment, downvoted to oblivion, that agrees with them like every other AH", ">No 37 year old wants to be aged like that!\n\nFfs grow up. She has no issue being the younger woman to her husband, who is most likely between 42 and 45. \n\nThere's 9 years between her and her stepson and 5- 8 years between her and her husband.", "Why tf would any emotionally mature adult care more about perceived age than honoring their personal relationship with family members?", "Thanks. It was actually kind of fun. Half the class was calling me Aunt (our last name).", "Perfect. She\u2019s not comfortable with it and told him no. Now he can ask his grandma who will hopefully want to. OP can just be a buddy at the wedding.", "Wow. Absolutely do not call and ask him that. YTA", " I think she's worried more about appearances than his wishes.", "Ooohhh... I don't read all the comments, just the comments and partial threads that are there when the page loads. \n\nWhelp, I'm glad you answered because I would have wasted time and effort composing a helpful and empathetic response. Thank you.", "That\u2019s because the appearance and her reality is that she\u2019s not his mother.  She is his father\u2019s wife.", "I mean I was just making a joke, we can always hope they see the error of their ways. Please, don't let me stop you from being so kind :)", "Well I still find it odd. I have three stepkids I didn't raise, but I still love them.", "Oohhhh haha OOPS!! \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI only will if they respond. It hinges on if the comments actually got them thinking or not."]}
