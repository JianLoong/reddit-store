As I stated, we do get along and I have helped him with issues in the past by listening, giving advice when asked, giving support, helping him talk to his father, and stuff like that. More like a friend than a mother figure. For as long as I've been involved with my husband, his son has had minimal involvement with his mother.\n\nHis wedding is in a few months. I couldn't be happier for him and his fiancee. He and my husband were discussing the wedding over the weekend. His fiancee will be doing a father/daughter dance and he asked me to do a mother/son dance with him. Admittedly I froze up for a moment because I was not expecting that. We just don't have that kind of relationship and I was unaware he saw it otherwise. I declined by saying I was honored he'd ask but that I thought it might be inappropriate and suggested that he could try asking his grandmother. He seemed to accept my answer but came off neutral over it. \n\nLast night my husband brought it up again and said he was a bit disappointed in me and that his son is pretty hurt by it but neither wants to push the issue. I feel bad for upsetting his son but at the same time I still feel like it'd be inappropriate to do the dance because I'm not his mother. I've never had a maternal role in his life.

It's just a fucking dance, and you basically chose to damage your relationship because you are offended by an implied title. I have the feeling this is about the ages involved and you not wanting to appear old enough to be his bio mom, rather than the quality of your relationship, but ... problem solved.

It'll be insincere if you agree to dance with him at this point and he deserves much better than that on his wedding day. He obviously thinks of you as a mother figure. Poor guy. I think it's really good that you set these boundaries now so that he can make sure to keep his future kids from getting to know you too well.", "Inappropriate how? There's nothing inappropriate about a stepson trying to build parental bonds with a step-parent.\n\nI certainly think a step-parent who joins the family when children are already adults does not have the same duty that they would have if they came in when the children were still minors. But not having a duty to fill a parental role with a 28 year old stepson doesn't make it inappropriate to have a mother-son dance at a wedding.\n\nAnd from what it sounds like, his bio mom wasn't even there for him to dance with. (Is bio mom even in the picture?)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA\n\nI don't know how much. You say you haven't had a maternal role with him, but you don't say you never want one. You don't say you hate dancing or have some kind of anxiety issue that would have made it a great burden. It obviously mattered to him. It reads like he has in general tried to form mother-son ties with you. Bio mom absented herself. Sounds like he doesn't have anyone in a maternal role and possibly hasn't had anyone in it since he was a young kid.", "YTA.  I'm only 9 years older than my eldest stepchild and I would have been honored to dance a mother/son dance with him at his wedding (fortunately his mother is very present in his life + we danced to a different song).

It doesn\u00b4t matter what your relationship with him is, it\u00b4s a package deal. You not feeling maternal to him is irrelevant, you thinking or feeling what your role is or should be is irrelevant, this is the life you married into. For better and for worse, right? All the good and the bad bits, and as much as you may dislike it, this is also a part of it.  \n\n\nNow it seems like you have a pretty decent relationship, so I am sure you don\u00b4t mean bad, but he expressed his wish to you, he wants you there as his mother figure, and because of what exactly do you feel that is inappropriate? It\u00b4s a celebration of love, a celebration of a union between two people, and his request to you fits that exactly.  \n\n\nThe fact that your husband also seems upset about it, shows me it\u00b4s important to him too.  \n\n\nI think you are too worried about what \"public opinion\" may think of it, than being there for your step son and being there for your husband. You have your role to play, that\u00b4s part of the package deal... so play it, or be called an AH.", "I'm going to vote YTA mostly because I don't think you fully considered the request before rejecting it -- and please really consider that it was a rejection. \n\nThis can be a really big deal to people who are the kids in a blended family, giving some sort of formal, public gesture to the stepparent, and then facing having that stepparent turn it down. He's 28, so you're at least not in the company of the people telling 9 year old kids they don't want to be called Dad, but it does feel like he isn't one of the people whose feelings you are most concerned about here, and I think you need to look at why that is. \n\nMy stepmother was only 9 years older than me. I get how it's different from someone who is physically old enough to have been your mother. I do feel for your stepson, because I think he was trying to acknowledge you as a part of your family -- and because it sounds like he's already had a mother figure reject him. He doesn't have a deep well of mothers to choose from, but he chose you and even if you can't bring yourself to do this dance for whatever your reasons are, I hope you really address the fact that you rejected the overature so that you guys can move past this.", "YTA  here is what you are missing.  your stepson even thou he understood you are not his mother he viewed you as his stepmother and loves and respects you for that and also views u really as his mom as you were there in his life.  age is just a number by the way.", "Why is it inappropriate?\n\nWith whose feelings, other than those of your stepson, are you concerned?\n\nYou don't have to want to do it. But from the moment he asked you it stopped being inappropriate.\n\nYTA for the reason you provided.", "NAH, although you are clearly missing that you do have a maternal role in his life, one that he sees, and values. I would dance with him. Take it as the honor he and your husband mean to confer.", "YTA for telling him it was inappropriate.\n\nAll this dance means is that he wants to honor you at his wedding. It\u2019s also a way to honor both you *and* your husband - you two raised him together as partners, and showing you how means that means to him is also a way to show his father. \n\nPerhaps the request was more about not wanting to be singled out - he may feel like his fianc\u00e9e having a father/daughter dance without him having the equivalent will highlight his lack of a mother/son relationship. \n\nAnd yet you are still the closest thing he has to a mother. Isn\u2019t that enough?\n\nI\u2019m not sure what exactly you meant by inappropriate. I\u2019ll be generous and assume you meant because you don\u2019t literally fit the role of \u201cmother.\u201d However, your stepson is aware of your relationship. He knows what he calls you and I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s not mom. He\u2019s likely not thinking of the literal word.\n\nBecause of that your use of \u201cinappropriate\u201d could be interpreted in many different ways. Your stepson may think you believe any affection he has for you is inappropriate because he should feel anything towards you. He may think it\u2019s because you don\u2019t see him in as an important person in your life and are confused why he would think you\u2019d want to support him on his wedding day. He may think you are implying something darker and more untoward, or have the more innocent but still problematic take that you are worried people may think you look like a couple of you two dance together.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a big deal. You made it one. Please talk to your stepson, ideally with other ideas of how you\u2019d like to be a part of his big day.", "You\u2019re not TAH. You explained perfectly well why you turned it down. His disappointment is somewhat understandable but also seems weird-due to ages and relationship as you\u2019ve outlined it. He will be ok and this will smooth over. His grandmother is the best stand in.", "YTA way to hurt a kid and then blame him. He offered because he sees you as a maternal figure. This isn\u2019t about you and it\u2019s weird to draw a line in the sand about it. I hope you get ready for always being on the outside since you rejected him so harshly", "Mild YTA for saying it would be inappropriate, it wouldn't be. I don't want to call you an AH because this is just more of a relationship advice question, but this is the sub we're in. I would say N A H, but I think an apology for not considering the offer more kindly is in order first.\n\nI'm curious about his mother, I take it she's not in the picture?\n\nYou're totally allowed to say no to his request, but making it about perceptions of what might be appropriate is the wrong way to go about this.\n\nI think you're taking an impersonal approach and that's what offends your family.\n\nYou are the closest thing to a mother he has, he asked you. You would be a fine placeholder and it would be doing him a favor, since his fiance wants the dance and it might be noticeable if he wasn't doing it (if only to him.)\n\nGrandma is a fine placeholder too, but he chose you and probably put thought and consideration into that choice. Then you dismissed that choice in a way that makes it seem like he *didn't* put thought into it. \n\nThis was an opportunity to grow closer in the future and to gain a son, and it kinda went over your head. \n\nIf you don't want to do the dance, come up with a more polite reason to decline and apologize. \"Sorry I immediately jumped to suggesting you ask grandma, I just wouldn't like that much attention and I didn't know how to react. That's very sweet of you for asking.\"\n\nIf you do want to do the dance based on replies here, you could probably still salvage the offer, with almost the same apology as above. \n\nFor some background, my dad was a piece of garbage and I've always thought my brother or uncle would walk me down the aisle and dance with me, even though they didn't raise me. It's just about playing our parts in silly traditions for fun and to build connections.", "This is a NAH situation if ever there was one\n\nI think the friendly chats meant more to him that you realise though", "YTA! It was an innocent request. Your step-son clearly views you as an important figure in his life and if anything you should be grateful that you hold such an important place in his life. You have burnt a lot of bridges with this action of yours and the sooner you try and make amends, the better it is.", "INFO: how long did he live at home after you came into the picture? You married his dad when he was 18, but how long did you know him before that? \n\nI do find it kind of odd that he was basically fully grown when you met him, so I get the lack of a mother/son bond, but now he seems to think you do have that bond??? Did this come out of left field or has he always treated you like a mother figure?", "NAH, I actually think that\u2019s valid. You clearly have cared about him and been there when he needed it, but you were not his mother. He seems to have some maternal feelings around you, but you don\u2019t have them for him. Which is fine. As long as you reiterate your love and that you\u2019ll be there all the same to support him and continue to support him, I think things should be ok. \n\nYou still showed him compassion and support when it mattered, but I think your feelings are valid. But his are too. Maybe this could give you a different perspective on what a mother figure can mean to someone.  But it\u2019s up to you", "YTA. Think about how the wedding will go: \n\nDJ announces Daddy/Daughter dance and has everyone clear the floor. Then\u2026..nothing, and it goes back to everyone doing their own thing.

I am in a similar situation but my bond with my partner's children is still strong and valid, just not parental. Explain this to both of them. NTA.", "YTA absolutely! You\u2019ve been his stepMOM for 10 YEARS. Maybe you don\u2019t feel like a maternal figure in his life because of the age difference but he seems to think of you as one!

You don't consider him a son. However, he considers you a maternal figure. Age differences aside, you've been there and have filled that role in his life for a decade. He simply wanted to acknowledge that and your importance.  You've pretty much spit in his face and said, \"nah\". He's not only hurt, but you've done some damage to your relationship.", "NTA nobody can force you to do anything but id rethink this because it might damage the relationship going forward. Just take one for the team and dance with him. I'm sure he'll appreciate it", "NAH, not sure when you entered his life but it seems you didn\u2019t raise him so I don\u2019t think you are out of line.", "NAH.\nDid you explain to them the same way you laid it out here?\n\nBoth positions sound reasonable.  Is he involved with his grandmother at all?", "YTA unfortunately. It sounds like you could work on your emotional intelligence. It is a beautiful thing that your stepson wants to celebrate and acknowledge the role you\u2019ve played in his life. He\u2019d have some pretty serious rejection/abandonment wounds from his mother and you kinda did it again. Marrying into anyone\u2019s family carries responsibilities, even when they\u2019re almost grown. If you can see the error of your ways you could acknowledge you got it wrong and didn\u2019t recognise how important it was to him, that his happiness is important to you and if it makes him happy of course you\u2019ll do it. It\u2019s okay that you felt awkward because he has a mother, but you can also respect his wishes to have the wedding day he wants. The fact you\u2019re only 9 years apart could be considered a fun family quirk! You could turn this into a good thing by letting him know you care and you are sorry for hurting him. It\u2019ll let him know you really do care and honestly, there\u2019s nothing to feel awkward about - it\u2019s an insecurity you need to address.", "NTA.

He may forgive this but he won't forget it. \n\nI remember when I asked my MIL to go dress shopping with me and she told me we just weren't that close...

Good lord it would take literally 3 minutes to dance with him and make him happy on this special day.", "If your stepson has come to you for advice and support as the partner of his bio parent then I would consider you to have a maternal/parental role in his life, and that he both loves and accepts you. \n\nStep children (especially when teenagers and older, as your stepson was) are notoriously hard on new partners of their bio-parents, regardless of whether they have a relationship with their other bio parent, because it challenges their \u2018normal\u2019. \n\nIt sounds very much like your stepson values you in the same way that he does his father, and the fact that he has/does come to you for advice, support, and at times guidance despite you coming into his life at the cusp of adulthood, is a huge leap of faith and trust for any older child/almost adult. \n\nI understand what you are saying about the minimal age gap between the two of you, and feeling like this is something you also do with your friends. I also understand that it is hard as a stepparent (my partner is one), to walk that very fine line of being there but not being seen as interfering.\n\nHowever, your stepson has chosen to publicly acknowledge that you are a parental figure in his life, because you have made him feel safe, accepted, and loved, in the form of a mother/son dance at his wedding.\n\nI would seriously ask you to consider his request again, he laid his heart on the line and told you (although not directly) that YOU are important to HIM. Not because you love his dad, but because HE loves and values YOU.\n\nIf you do choose to accept this honour then you can say that you never expected to be asked and were thrown off by the request but it would be your honour. Be honest, tell him that you never expected him to ask and that you just tried to be a stable person in his life, not a replacement mom. To be honest, the fact you never tried to force a \u201cmom\u201d position in his life is probably why he considers you as such.", "YTA. He wouldn't have asked you if your relationship meant nothing to him. You have just told him that he doesn't mean much to you.", "Being a maternal figure has nothing to do with your age difference. YTA it's a dance JUST A DANCE on your stepson's important day. I don't know why you think if you don't have an appropriate age gap you can't be a mother or maternal figure\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA, this young man holds you in high regard. You and your stepson have an excellent relationship, one that many blended families would jump at the opportunity to have. You may not feel like his mom, but you should absolutely take one dance, at his wedding to honor the closeness you share. You say you never felt like you had a motherly role due to age and a few other things, well guess what, all the things you described doing are all things a mom would do.", "YTA YTA YTA. He offered you a dance. He is obviously seeing you with respect and you shit in him. Wow. Just wow.   YTA YTA", "My mom never really had a dad. He abandoned his 5 children with their schizophrenic mother when my mom was 12, and she had to fish in rivers and steal apples to keep herself and younger brothers from starving. When my parents got married, she asked the DJ multiple times not to play a father daughter dance. He did anyway, and my mom sat there in shock and humiliation and heartbreak in front of everyone. My dad\u2019s dad quickly got up, took her hand, and danced with her. It was one of the most meaningful and loving moments of her life. She continued to love my poppop for decades after my parent\u2019s divorce. At his funeral last year, she sat next to me and cried for the man who stepped in as a father when she needed it most. \n\nYou chose to do the opposite. \n\nDo with that as you will.", "YTA. Maybe you don't see your relationship one way but he does.. YOU SHOULD BE HONORED. You know some step parents work really hard to bond with step kids. Do better", "NTA\nYour refusal was polite and well explained.", "YTA. He\u2019s had minimal involvement with his mother, and you\u2019ve assumed that role by marrying his dad and being maternal towards him. I think you\u2019re freaked out about the age difference being close, which is something you need to work out yourself and not make that his issue.", "Not intentionally TA.. but yeah a little bit YTA \n\nLook it maybe he wants this dance in order to show how much he admires and respects your place in his fathers world. Not a maternal thing, \n\nAsk him, its the easiest way to find out -", "YTA you suck.", "Ultimately it is your decision, however maybe it would be better to not think of this as a true \u201cMother-Son\u201d dance but as a way for him to thank / honor you for being what seems like at least a good friend, listener, and support to him.\n\nHis bio mom isn\u2019t in the picture and he probably felt that for a long time and you filled a void in his heart whether it seems like it or not.\n\nSo, would you reconsider this dance just on the grounds that maybe he wants this to be a special moment so you know that you mean something to him?", "If you do decide to change your mind, OP, I would suggest being completely honest with him.\n\n\u201cI was surprised because you didn\u2019t want a parental relationship at first, but I\u2019d be delighted to take this place in your special day.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t try to dodge it, just be honest with him.", "Yeah, going against the grain here. NTA, you didn\u2019t parent him. He was an adult when you married his father.", "YTA Your stepson gave you a chance most stepmothers would kill for. I can understand the awkwardness being only 9 years older than him, but that isn\u2019t his fault. If anything, it\u2019s the dad\u2019s fault. Also, imagine how the kid felt when his dad brought home a woman who was young enough to be his sister. Yet you still built a relationship with him and he came to see you as a mother-figure. Yet what did you do? You told him you don\u2019t see him as family! Maybe not your intention, but that\u2019s how I interpreted it. \n\nAlso, were you afraid a \u201cWhat are you doing stepson!?\u201d situation would play out if he got too close?", "Definitely YTA\n\nWhile you may not be much older than him, you played a role in his life which you helped to make him a better person and  you saying no was a slap in the face.", "YTA - You have been in his life for ten years.  He is not close to his mother but it sounds like he is close to you.  I bet if he didn't ask you to dance with him at the wedding you would be here complaining about that.  Give him a call and tell him you would be honored.  It is 3 minutes out of your life and would make him and your husband happy.", "I understand the hesitation but YTA. I feel like it\u2019s going to take him a bit to get over that, if he ever does fully.", "I married my husband when his son was 16. His bio mother  has been absent since he was a baby. If he asked me for the mother/son dance, I would be honored. Also, I would never dream of hurting his feelings or embarrassing him by declining.", "NTA, you married his father when this kid was 18 basically an adult. It\u2019s a weird ask.\n\nI don\u2019t get the YTAs, it\u2019s not like a 14 yr old child asking someone who married his dad at 4", "This is important to him.   Please rethink and say yes.", "YTA.  Self conscious step parent here.  If one of the kids asked me to do that, I would be honored.  You fail to realize that things you did with him and for him over the years actually were parenting.", "INFO: Is he hot?", "YTA", "Okay, why are you so hung up on this. If a friend of a friend who ask me to do something for them that takes less than 5 minutes and means a lot to them I would think about it. Not just shit on them. You have known this young man 10 years. I assume your going to the wedding.  Would it have killed you to dance on dance with him? Or at least thought about it.", "YTA", "Raising the kid. She wasn\u2019t in his life before he could drive.", "I've never considered that as holding a maternal role since that's a lot of what I do for my friends and siblings. Mainly because the things I help him with and talk to are leagues different than the approach he has with his father and asking for some 'dad' input.", "I have a feeling in the future when she is \u201cgrandpa\u2019s wife\u201d instead of grandma, this realization of this decision will set in.", "When my nephew was 12 they had a Grandparents\u2019 Day at their school.  His maternal grand parents were gone, and my parent were not in good health.  My older brother and SIL asked me if I would go in place of my parents and I was honored to do so even though I was nowhere near old enough to be a grandmother.  I did it because it was important to my nephew.  YTA", "Exactly. This is no different than if he'd asked a cool aunt, older cousin, hell, even older sibling. When people who don't have a good relationship with a parent encounter moments like this, where a ceremonial role is normally filled by that parent, they will often ask someone else who has an adjacent role in their life to fill the part in the ceremony. It's not necessarily saying that other person is the exact same as a mother/father, but that they are a person who has had some sort of significant guiding/support role that helped fill some of the gap the parent left. OP should be thrilled that her step-son thinks so highly of her, not turning him down.", "Thank you for the input. I'd say the dynamic around us has always been buddy-buddy. I'm always introduced as his dad's wife or just by name, which I've never had a problem with, and for his dad its 'this is my dad'.\n\nHis bio mom is not in the picture now after he minimized contact with her after turning 18. After we got engaged, he did feel weird about his dad marrying someone close to his age and voiced that concern. He did ask if I was going to \"make it weird acting like his mom\" during that talk and I told him only if he wanted me to. He said he didn't but thinking about it now I'll ask him if had changed his mind about that. It's the dance title itself that gets me the most, because in general I have nothing against dancing with family.", "I mean.  She hurt a person and that\u2019s unfortunate.  But he\u2019s not a \u201ckid.\u201d He\u2019s a 28 year old man and she\u2019s 9 years older.  I can understand her hesitation at the mother/son title.  Hopefully OP can become comfortable with a dance honoring their relationship, even if it isn\u2019t a parent/child bond.", "This needs to be much higher. It seems like they need to reevaluate their relationship. Also it is a request, she can say no for whatever reason.", "I do believe he is upset by it. He did his little pursed lips thing he does when he's uncomfortable after he asked. Regardless, I do plan on calling him up and apologizing to him, and also ask when he went from \" please don't try acting like a mom\" to asking to do a mother/son dance. Not upset if he changed his mind, just curious.", "N T A means someone else is the AH, do you think that? Or do you really mean N A H (no AH)?", "I did explain it to him that way. He is very involved with his grandparents still and close to his grandmother since she helped take care of him a lot.", "Sure, I do all that stuff for my friends too, but I'm not a decade older than them and married to their dads. You were doing the things his bio mom should have been doing for him so he saw you as a maternal figure.", "So you and your stepson are friends and he wants to honor your relationship by giving you a special dance at his wedding? I had a buddy of mine \u201ckeep me company down the aisle\u201d at my wedding. It doesn\u2019t have to be that deep, traditions don\u2019t have to be strictly followed to the letter. YTA", "Does it help you make the mental calculus when you consider that a lot of people ask their siblings to take on the parent roles in their weddings? One of my friends had her younger brother walk her down the aisle. Another friend had the parent-child dance with his older sister. \n\nCan you think of yourself as sort of a halfway point between mom and big sister? Someone who\u2019s been there for him, who he looks up to, and who he loves enough to want to honor on his big day.", "You must be a wonderful Aunt. Seriously.", "Bro. Honestly, if he asked you saying yes is not \u201cmaking it weird acting like his mom\u201d  They are honoring important people in their lives with a dance. If he is important to you, explain your weird ass reasoning for declining and have a conversation. If not there is nothing else for you to do, the point has been made.", "For a decade he\u2019s seen her as  some sort of parental figure, that\u2019s really harsh to reject that.", "You're obviously a benefit in his life if you know him so well he does a little 'pursed lip thing'. That sounds a little bit mum like. I'm pretty sure with your level of healthy communication you can sort out this misunderstanding because that's all it is. I hope the occasion goes well!", "Like it or not but you know how you spotted that \u201clittle pursed lip thing he does when he\u2019s uncomfortable \u201c? \n\nYeah that\u2019s the sort of thing a Mum knows & spots. \n\nRemove the Mother/Son title of the dance. Would you feel happier doing it then? If so it\u2019s just the name of the dance & is a pretty silly thing to ruin a perfectly good relationship over. Plus I hate to break it to you but I strongly suspect he sees you as a Mother figure even if he doesn\u2019t realise it himself. \n\nActions always speak louder than words remember.", "Asking you for a mother/ son dance does not mean he's placed you in a motherly role all of a sudden. He just wants to dance with in the same capacity you are in his life, a friend.", ">and also ask when he went from \" please don't try acting like a mom\" to asking to do a mother/son dance. \n\nOP, whatever you do don't ask him this!  Your boy is allowed to have conflicting feelings.  This is  your chance to be kind and loving.  Please remember this is about him - not you.", "Why even go there?  Just call him and tell him you thought about it and you would be honored.", "Oh my god don't ask him that. What is wrong with you?", "He\u2019s been a legal adult for the entire 10 years.  And he specifically told her earlier in their relationship that she wasn\u2019t \u201cmom\u201d (which is totally understandable given the age difference and his age when she entered his life.)  \n\nI do hope OP can clear the air with him and participate in the wedding in a way they\u2019re all comfortable with."]}
