Yes, it is not great his children are suffering because he is suffering or that your parents need to help.\n\nBut saying that now, at this particular point, when he has a possible solution, it's not useful. You want him to stay home, not to go to therapy, for it probably to get worse because he needs to haul himself up by his bootstrap. Intensive residential therapy might solve this so you can all get your lives back on track.", "It sounds like your brother is drowning. He hasn\u2019t recovered well from his grief. He is at least able to recognize that he can\u2019t be the father his children currently need and he\u2019s trying to get therapy help. That is a positive move in the right direction. Screaming at him won\u2019t help. Clearly he isn\u2019t dealing well with his loss and his kids are suffering because of it. The best thing you can do is volunteer to take the kids for some of the time to give your parents a break. While you have the kids, try to make a positive impact on them. They need love and encouragement right now.", "YTA novel idea how about you help your parents?", "Did either you or your brother offer to take the kids? It seems he realized that his grieving is affecting his ability to be a parent and tried to do what was right by them which is letting your parents step in and give them the attention they are trying to seek (which is clear through their acting out). As parent if you aren\u2019t okay they aren\u2019t okay. It seems like because he isn\u2019t handling it the way you \u201cthink\u201d he should, you rather bash him instead of being an actual brother and help. Helping how you feel you should isn\u2019t always what is best for the person that needs it. You should take a step back and ask him how you could help him instead of judging.", "Anyone who uses the sexist phrase Man Up is YTA", "YTA - not one thought for how HE is dealing with the death of his wife at all. Yeah. The kids aren't dealing well but neither is he and your best piece of advice is to \"man up\". You're an asshole for pushing that toxic masculinity crap. He needs help, and the day he tries to head off to get it your response is to attack him and belittle him. Perhaps try a little empathy and actually help your brother process his grief.", "Yta - your brother and his kids suffered a major loss. The kids won\u2019t get better or get through this loss unless your brother is able to get himself together. He found a way to get help. He knows what is needed and your parents understand.

And saying that to him might make him at least like help the kids with their grieving. \n   Yet I also feel that YTA because even if it has been a year since your SIL has passed it sounds like your brother is still grieving about it, and is trying to  go to therapy to better himself for helping your niece and nephew. \n     Im also wondering if possibly their school counslor/s or if you have talked to the kids about how they are feeling with it and if theres anything you can do for them?", "YTA\n\nYour brother lost his wife. Short of you losing your wife, you have no right to pass judgement. Even then, everyone handles things differently. He is having trouble and has decided the best thing for him and the kids is for him to seek help. After all, how the fuck is he supposed to help his kids if he can't even help himself? How does one convince teenagers to seek therapy when the adult telling them they need to go isn't going themselves? \n\nHe is doing the right thing. He's seeking help. You are a giant ah for not understanding that and an even bigger ah for using that bullshit \"man up\" garbage.", "Man, YTA. I get where you're coming from, and the kids definitely *are* Sidney's responsibility, but right now it sounds like he's honestly *incapable* of taking up that responsibility.   \n\n\nAnd if that's the case, then the kids are better being with your parents than him right now. They're right, butt out.", "Info:\nHas he discussed the children\u2019s need in depth with your parents?\nIs he paying them?\nWould it be generally safer for them to be in your parents\u2019 home?\nHas he setup therapy for the kids?", "Omg, YTA x 1,000.\n\nYOUR BROTHER LOST HIS WIFE. Falling apart as a result of losing your spouse does not make him a bad father, it makes him human. Ideally he'd be able to parent through his grief, but it sounds like that's not the case with him, and that is not a moral failing on his part and does not make him a shit dad.\n\nIf you don't switch from asshole brother to supportive brother, son, and uncle, you're going to lose him, and BEST case scenario is that you lose him because he goes NC. If he's saying things like \"it's what's best for the kids\" you could very realistically lose him to something much more tragic.", "My family went through this.  I wish the family member would have dumped his kids off and gone to therapy.\n\nIt's not only grief but trauma, too.  If you really want to help then take the kids yourself off yoru parents hands.", "Me and other brother have both tried to help but it's like he's a zombie", "I'm not sure if he told our parents everything that was going on with the kids. Paying them no and it most likely would be safer especially for my niece and my younger nephew. no he hasn't set up therapy for the kids", "Yeah. That's called grief. And again. He was going somewhere to get help. And your reaction is to yell at and belittle him. \n\nWhen your partner dies, you are free to grieve and process however you wish. But you don't get to tell someone else how they should be grieving and processing.", "And he realizes that he\u2019s a zombie. That\u2019s why he\u2019s leaving his kids with safe adults - WHO CONSENT TO HIS PLAN - so he can get himself some help. He needs the help before he can be in the right headspace to be there for his kids. He\u2019s being a good dad. \n\nYTA. Mind your own business until someone asks you for something directly.", "Yeah YTA\nIt\u2019s clear he\u2019s an incompetent parent who is unable to keep his children safe.\nThe smartest thing he could do is relinquish them to family who can protect them.\nGrief is also all consuming. \nEither support your bro and his kids or keep your opinion to yourself. The kids don\u2019t need to hear all your negative feedback for their one remaining parent.", "YTA. His wife just died. He needs mental health care. If you\u2019re so concerned about your parents then you take in the kids, or maybe your other brother can. Clearly sidney needs help and you just reemed him out for asking for it. Tell me how well you recover a year after your spouse dies & your children start acting out. Tell me what a great parent you are when your wife dies and leaves you alone after 17+ years of partnership.", "YTA. You appear to be so contemptuous of your brother's grief that even his decision to put the kids with family while he sorts himself out to be able to help his kids pisses you off. He's doing what's best for his kids, but because it's not what *you* think he should do, you feel the need to judge him. Stay the fuck out of it if you can't be helpful. Maybe try considering what he's going through and having some compassion.", "YTA. I get that you want what\u2019s best for your niece and nephews, but you went about it the wrong way.  Your brother needs help and having your parents take the kids is probably what he thinks is best for them. He is in a dark place. Yelling at him is only making it worse. What if he attempts self-harm due to you and your siblings piling up on him? You would feel terrible. \n\nIf you really want to help those child then be in there life and help them face to face. Help your parents with them. Why didn\u2019t you and your brother offer to take in the children?", "YTA. Honestly this sounds like a \u201cput your own oxygen mask on first\u201d kind of scenario. He can\u2019t be a good father and help them until he gets himself some help first.", "ESH. He's obviously hurting bad and recognizes that he needs help for his trauma, but this can't be helping those kids. They're hurting too and now after losing their Mom, they're losing their Dad too, however temporarily it might be. In addition to being shipped off to another state away from everything familiar. I get it. You're worried about your nibblings, but ranting at him to \"man up\" wasn't going to be productive or helpful. It's a bad situation and unfortunately I don't know if there are any good answers.", "YTA.\n\nHe's actually being responsible. People can't magically will away grief and trauma. \n\nIf you don't get it maybe you don't love your wife all that much.\n\nIf you're that concerned about your parents maybe you should be stepping up.", "ESH. He\u2019s an AH for abandoning his kids, you\u2019re one for yelling at him instead of providing support or suggestions. Poor kids!", "YTA. You\u2019re such an asshole, it\u2019s unbelievable. Just let your brother grieve for god\u2019s sake. What is the matter with you that you can\u2019t let your brother grieve without you \u2018reeming\u2019 him out? In 1 year, he has gone from a loving husband and a father of 2 with his wife to having to become the mother and the father whilst having to learn everything his wife did that he didn\u2019t know about. He grieved when he could. That moment where he left the kids at your parents was probably the first moment he felt as though he could unleash a years worth of pain and sadness out and you decided to come along and yell at him for not being Superman. He literally just did it so he could spend a few months getting over that year\u2019s worth of trauma and become a good dad again and you won\u2019t let him. Help him out, or else this whole thing will get way worse for everybody.", "YTA. Be careful, he might be dumping the kids because he's thinking of suicide. Check on him regularly and help him get to that therapy. He needs to get himself right first before he can help his children.", "YTA. Did you or your brother offer to take on the kids for a few months to help your brother out?", "This is what grief looks like when you love someone. I wonder how your wife feels knowing that you would not grieve if she died.\n\nIf you and your siblings actually supported your bother through his grief, his children would also benefit.\n\nIt is easy to pass judgement without actually doing anything to help. \n\nYTA", "So you offer to take the kids", "instead of man up he should PARENT up", "Don't you think maybe you're not equipped to help, and maybe a zombie might need real psychiatric care that you can't provide?", "He's like a zombie because he's fucking grieving the loss of his wife and has no idea how to help himself, let alone his children. Do you not have one shred of compassion for what your brother is going through?", "All the more reason he is doing the right thing. It seems you are deciding how he SHOULD be handling this because he's a Man. And he's not being Man enough. If it seems like he's a zombie, doesn't that scream \"I need help\" to you? He not only lost his wife and is unable to cope, but his family is treating him like he's a failure - something I'm sure he already feels. Thank goodness for your parents. I hope they are able to give their grandchildren some respite from the hellish year they've had. And I hope your brother can find a compassionate support system - something he clearly will never get from his own siblings.\n\nYTA", "... how are you this unaware? that's literally why he needs professional help. you admit you can't help him because he's so deep in grief, but you think he can just snap out of it?", "Yeah, that's why he's going to therapy.\n\nDo you think if he killed himself the kids would be better off?"]}
