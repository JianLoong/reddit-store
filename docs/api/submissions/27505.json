Man realises he has a problem, goes to therapy to try and sort it, and you dump on him that he is not sorting himself out instantly and the way you want him to. Yes, it is not great his children are suffering because he is suffering or that your parents need to help.\n\nBut saying that now, at this particular point, when he has a possible solution, it's not useful. You want him to stay home, not to go to therapy, for it probably to get worse because he needs to haul himself up by his bootstrap. Intensive residential therapy might solve this so you can all get your lives back on track.", "It sounds like your brother is drowning. He hasn\u2019t recovered well from his grief. He is at least able to recognize that he can\u2019t be the father his children currently need and he\u2019s trying to get therapy help. That is a positive move in the right direction. Screaming at him won\u2019t help. Clearly he isn\u2019t dealing well with his loss and his kids are suffering because of it. The best thing you can do is volunteer to take the kids for some of the time to give your parents a break. While you have the kids, try to make a positive impact on them. They need love and encouragement right now.", "YTA novel idea how about you help your parents?", "Did either you or your brother offer to take the kids? It seems he realized that his grieving is affecting his ability to be a parent and tried to do what was right by them which is letting your parents step in and give them the attention they are trying to seek (which is clear through their acting out). As parent if you aren\u2019t okay they aren\u2019t okay. It seems like because he isn\u2019t handling it the way you \u201cthink\u201d he should, you rather bash him instead of being an actual brother and help. Helping how you feel you should isn\u2019t always what is best for the person that needs it. You should take a step back and ask him how you could help him instead of judging.", "Anyone who uses the sexist phrase Man Up is YTA", "YTA - not one thought for how HE is dealing with the death of his wife at all. Yeah. The kids aren't dealing well but neither is he and your best piece of advice is to \"man up\". You're an asshole for pushing that toxins masculinity crap. He needs help, and the day he tries to head off to get it your response is to attack him and belittle him. Perhaps try a little empathy and actually help your brother process his grief.", "Yta - your brother and his kids suffered a major loss. The kids won\u2019t get better or get through this loss unless your brother is able to get himself together. He found a way to get help. He knows what is needed and your parents understand.

And saying that to him might make him at least like help the kids with their grieving. \n   Yet I also feel that YTA because even if it has been a year since your SIL has passed it sounds like your brother is still grieving about it, and is trying to  go to therapy to better himself for helping your niece and nephew. \n     Im also wondering if possibly their school counslor/s or if you have talked to the kids about how they are feeling with it and if theres anything you can do for them?", "YTA\n\nYour brother lost his wife. Short of you losing your wife, you have no right to pass judgement. Even then, everyone handles things differently. He is having trouble and has decided the best thing for him and the kids is for him to seek help. After all, how the fuck is he supposed to help his kids if he can't even help himself? How does one convince teenagers to seek therapy when the adult telling them they need to go isn't going themselves? \n\nHe is doing the right thing. He's seeking help. You are a giant ah for not understanding that and an even bigger ah for using that bullshit \"man up\" garbage.", "Man, YTA. I get where you're coming from, and the kids definitely *are* Sidney's responsibility, but right now it sounds like he's honestly *incapable* of taking up that responsibility.   \n\n\nAnd if that's the case, then the kids are better being with your parents than him right now. They're right, butt out.", "Info:\nHas he discussed the children\u2019s need in depth with your parents?\nIs he paying them?\nWould it be generally safer for them to be in your parents\u2019 home?\nHas he setup therapy for the kids?", "Omg, YTA x 1,000.\n\nYOUR BROTHER LOST HIS WIFE. Falling apart as a result of losing your spouse does not make him a bad father, it makes him human. Ideally he'd be able to parent through his grief, but it sounds like that's not the case with him, and that is not a moral failing on his part and does not make him a shit dad.\n\nIf you don't switch from asshole brother to supportive brother, son, and uncle, you're going to lose him, and BEST case scenario is that you lose him because he goes NC. If he's saying things like \"it's what's best for the kids\" you could very realistically lose him to something much more tragic.", "My family went through this.  I wish the family member would have dumped his kids off and gone to therapy.\n\nIt's not only grief but trauma, too.  If you really want to help then take the kids yourself off yoru parents hands.", "Me and other brother have both tried to help but it's like he's a zombie", "I'm not sure if he told our parents everything that was going on with the kids. Paying them no and it most likely would be safer especially for my niece and my younger nephew. no he hasn't set up therapy for the kids", "Yeah. That's called grief. And again. He was going somewhere to get help. And your reaction is to yell at and belittle him. \n\nWhen your partner dies, you are free to grieve and process however you wish. But you don't get to tell someone else how they should be grieving and processing.", "And he realizes that he\u2019s a zombie. That\u2019s why he\u2019s leaving his kids with safe adults - WHO CONSENT TO HIS PLAN - so he can get himself some help. He needs the help before he can be in the right headspace to be there for his kids. He\u2019s being a good dad. \n\nYTA. Mind your own business until someone asks you for something directly.", "Yeah YTA\nIt\u2019s clear he\u2019s an incompetent parent who is unable to keep his children safe.\nThe smartest thing he could do is relinquish them to family who can protect them.\nGrief is also all consuming. \nEither support your bro and his kids or keep your opinion to yourself. The kids don\u2019t need to hear all your negative feedback for their one remaining parent."]}
