I added her to my lease and we now split rent. So far everything has been going smooth and I enjoy having her around, except for one thing that's really been irking me. She has way too many clothes, some of which she doesn't even wear. I've been talking to her about freeing up some closet space for the last couple months and she said she would take time to go through all her clothes and get rid of some she didn't want anymore. She never took the time to do that.\n\nI became frustrated with waiting so I went through her clothes while she was out and donated the ones she rarely wears to a thrift store. She instantly picked up on it and I told her to look at it as she always have (which is never) and since it didn't exist to her except to add clutter, it shouldn't be a problem. She had a lot to say and over the past few days she would mention items that she just now remembered since they are now absent, some of which I didn't even touch like her heels and makeup. She said she hasn't been wearing some of the clothes because it's seasonal wear and most of them were newer clothes that she was waiting to wear this summer. Although I can hear her out, sometimes you have to rip the bandaid off for the greater good.\n\nI let her take up most of my dresser space since most of the drawers were empty except for my socks and boxers. We split the closet and have both of our clothes hanging but her side was getting too stuffy to the point you could barely push the hangers because there was no room for them to move. She thinks it's unfair because I kept my shoe collection but I told her it wouldn't be a problem if she was tidy with her clothes like I am with my shoes and it's like comparing apples and oranges. I have a space where I keep them stored so they aren't cluttered and they are expensive, I look at them as more of a collectable and not just everyday clothes that I can easily replace so I'm not going to entertain that comparison.

Sometimes you have to rip the bandaid off for the greater good.", "YTA \n\nDestroying or getting rid of someone else\u2019s belongings without their knowledge, or against their consent, is quite actually a method of abuse that is spoken about frequently in DV cases. \n\n\u201cIf your possessions have been destroyed or discarded, it follows that any of them could be destroyed or discarded at any time, that you have no control over the objects in your life. It\u2019s a short step then to see that the real motive is to make you cede control of the existential too, your thoughts, beliefs, and actions, which are also your possessions although they are more ephemeral.\u201d\n\nWhether you meant to or not, you just sent the message to your girlfriend that her stuff, an extension and representation of her and who she is, is not safe around you and may be subject to disappearing without her knowledge or consent. It is incredibly destabilizing.", "YTA...You stole her sh\\*t and threw it away on her? And she paying half the rent? That entitles her to half the space!

You don't throw out another person's things. Your perception is that these items were useless but it's not your call, it's hers. OF COURSE if you live in a climate that varies throughout the year, there would be clothes you hadn't seen her wear since the winter when you moved in together. \n\nHow are you even impacted if HER side of the closet is full? \n\nYou are pretty new to living together FT and you effed this situation up. You should have given her more time or set time - together - to solve this. I absolutely understand why she would be mad and have lost trust in you.", "YTA\n\nWhat you have described is theft. You took property that did not belong to you without the permission of the owner.\n\nFrankly, I'm surprised your gf didn't move right back out but since she seems to be giving you another chance, you need to apologize and have a discussion about healthy boundaries. You should also be prepared to fork over some $$$ so she can replace items if she wishes.", "So your stuff is \u201ccollectible\u201d, but hers is \u201cclutter\u201d? \n\nYTA.

Donating without asking is over the top controlling! Some of us have sentimental clothes. Some of us have vintage clothes worth more then you realize. We have clothes that we keep just because of a memory or person they are attached to. This would be like her throwing out video games and equipment, or tools, golf clubs, baseball equipment etc. without asking. Just because you don\u2019t understand why she needs them doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t need them.

Some might call that theft, but here we just say you're an AH.\n\nI would dump you, FYI. She probably regrets being on the lease now!", "YTA. No question.\nYou stole a bunch of her clothes and got rid of them without her consent.\nHave you even stopped to consider that maybe your GF has never had a place to put seasonal clothes before? Instead of offering to help and finding solutions WITH her, you decided to go through all of her things, pull out stuff that you deemed unworthy, and then drop it off at a donation center? It is definitely the equivalent of your shoes. How would you feel if she did the same thing with your shoes? Asked you to get them out of the way because she felt like they took up too much space and when you didn't comply she went through them all and got rid of a bunch because she's probably never seen you wear them either.", "Who do you think you are? YTA.", "YTA. You should also be an ex-boyfriend. How old are you? Grow up.", "YTA on so many levels. That is a massive invasion of her privacy, you have no idea if any of those items held sentimental or even financial value.

You have to know that.", "YTA for getting rid of her stuff without permission.   \n\nI get your frustration, but you stepped across the line of what's right.  \n\nApologize.  Ask her what kind of additional storage she'd like - for off-season clothing.   Under-bed bins, for example.   Or the 5-in-1 hangers (from Amazon) that let you hang multiple shirts, skirts, or slacks on one hanger.  \n\nAnd when you apologize, MEAN it.", "YTA. How would you feel if she just went through your stuff and threw away things she didn't see you use very often?

You \"adult\" and have a serious conversation about your concern. Grow up dude.", "YTA because you don't get to choose what someone can wear or whether they get to keep something they don't wear. She should be rightly pissed at you for this and it could have been handled a lot differently if you had talked about it.", "Yikes. You donated her stuff?!? YTA! I don't even go through my teenagers clothes like that.", "YTA.\n\nYou are an AH with a bit of paternalization thrown in. You got rid of someone else's possessions without discussing it with them. It doesn't matter about too many, or how much space. You took her possessions and essentially stole them. \n\nIf you were frustrated you use your words. You tell her. You offer to help. You come up with a deadline together. What you DO NOT do is patronizingly decide that you are just going to handle it without her consent because you think you know better.", "YTA most definitely! You have zero right to just take someone's clothes and chose to donate them. THEY DO NOT BELONG TO YOU. Straight up if my boyfriend every did this to me this would be the end of the relationship", "Yta and she should throw away your stuff as she is moving out.", "Absolutely positively without a shred of doubt YTA and I mean you are a huge AH.  How about if she goes through your tool collection and donates any she doesn\u2019t think you use often?  You are going to be lucky if you get through this without losing your GF and some body parts.", "YTA. You clearly don't respect your girlfriend. How can you think you're in the right here?", "YTAH for even asking if YTAH. What you did was horribly wrong and disrespectful.\nApologise profusely, give a ton of gift cards from clothings stores, and promise to never do that again.", ">I went through her clothes while she was out and donated the ones she rarely wears to a thrift store\n\nHere's where you fucked up. If it isn't causing damage or piling up, you never have a right to donate/throw out another person's belongings. EVER. She might have some sentimental items or extremely valuable items amongst the clothes she doesn't wear often, but even outside of that, it's her stuff. I'm sure you have things she thinks of as a waste of space, how would you feel if you came home and suddenly your shoe collection was just gone because your partner felt the space could be used better for something else?\n\nHad you pulled out some things and put them in boxes so she could go through them and force her to start at least thinking about what she wanted to get rid of, that would of been a good move. If you sheduled a spring cleaning day that both of you could purge some shit, that'd be legit. But unfortunately you jumped the gun, so ya, **yta.**\n\nAnd you manage to be even more of an asshole by also having a collection of clothes you never wear. Like grow up, your shoe collection definitely takes up more space than is reasonable to a non-sneaker head, shoes and their boxes are not small items and stack up fast. \n\nAlso, you've definitely stirred the paranoia pot. Whenever your partner loses something or can't find something right away now, she's gonna assume you threw it out and it's gonna lead to her buying doubles, hiding things, and arguing with you over things you never did.", "YTA\n\nyou dont ever get rid of someone elses items", "I hope OP has a gaming computer that is taking up too much space.", "YTA. You literally stole her things and donated them. You even say they still fit on her side of the closet, though it was a tight fit. Sounds like a you problem then for being bothered by a non-issue. Hope she ends it honestly, this is so disrespectful to her, her possessions and frankly her money she spent on them.", "YTA - You donated her clothes.  What if she thought you had too many shoes and donated ones?  You would be my ex.  Your apples to oranges argument is crap. For her, some of that clothes have good memories.", "YTA how would you feel if she just took all your stuff and sold it or gave it away? If she just took all your shoes and sold them? You gave away items that weren't yours, essentially stealing them. If you were getting frustrated the move would be to schedule time to go through the closet together so that you both could get rid of clothing you don't need anymore. She can't trust you around her stuff anymore and you seem to lack any concern for her or her items in what you consider  \"your\" space.", "Yup, YTA.", "YTA\nAbsolutely an AH move. Hope she takes the cost of replacing her summer clothes off the rent, if she doesn't dump you before then.", "YTA. Never mess with a girl's clothes.", "YTA. You don't get rid of things that don't belong to you because they bother you. You ask the girlfriend to go through things together with you.", "YTA. You stole her belongings.", "YTA. And abusive. You stole her stuff, and now are gaslighting her for being upset about it.", "YTA and you clearly aren't ready to be living with anyone if this is your attitude. I hope you plan on selling some of your shoe collection to pay her back for the things you literally stole from her.", "YTA A woman's clothing is SACROSANCT. Clothes, to women, are tied up with WAY, WAY, WAAAAYYY MORE than a mere utilitarian idea to simply cover up. You NEVER, EVER go through a woman's closet unless she has specifically requested you to do so. \n\nMost guys look at clothes as what will be comfortable, keep me warm, keep me cool, or make my bros laugh with the dumb t-shirt slogan... Women have clothes for every imaginable occasion, every possible mood and even when we do, sometimes we don't \"CONNECT\" with ANY item at our disposal AT ALL. You cannot possibly know how HUGELY you fucked up because you will likely never have the intimate relationship with your clothing like a lot of women do.  You'd better grovel-REALLY WELL-  for the next three years, because dude, this was HUGE.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nI'd leave you over this.\n\nI understand she was not getting to it. The solution would be to set aside a time and help her. To do it unilaterally is...theft. Worse than that, it tells her you don't respect her or her stuff. How can she ever trust you again with posessions that are meaningful to her?", "Wtf of course YTA and the fact that you 1. did it in the first place and 2. are questioning whether or not it was the right thing to do is absolutely astonishing.\n\nI hope you go home one day and your shoe collection is gone", "YTA\n\nI hope she sells all your expensive shoes.\n\nYou need to declutter and sometimes you\u2019ve got to rip off that bandaid.", "YTA.

Sure, you could have left her stuff alone and seriously explained how all her stuff was causing an issue. But if you were going to spend time going through her items, why not box them up and when she has time, you explain the problem and that you think these are items she does not wear as much. Then she can go through her items and decide what to keep. There were many solutions! She could have gotten bins to store extra clothes under the bed or at the top of a closest. \n\nI saw this happen in my family, and speaking from personal experience, this is a bad idea. She will feel like none of her belongings are safe and if she ever loses or misplaced something (assuming you didn\u2019t get rid of it) she will think you did it and this was cause fights.\n\nIf you want to solve this and if it\u2019s not too late, go to the place you donated and see if you can buy any of it back.

Her things don\u2019t belong to you just because she moved in. Nothing you described about the quantity of clothes or how they were stored warranted this extreme reaction and breach of her trust and personal space.

It\u2019s funny that you consider her clothes that fit in her half of the closet to be excessive, yet your shoes that have their own separate storage area is perfectly normal.

(And why do you need to breathe on her side of the closet anyway)\n\n\u201cIf they really meant that much.\u201d Dismissive. \n\nSo on top of being a thieving asshole, you\u2019re also controlling, selfish and dismissive. Got it. YTA", "I have prob like 3x more clothes than my bf. It is organized, but it is a lot. It's not your call to decide how much she should have or if she needs it and wears it or not. You waaay crossed the line dude.\nAlso, she paid for those stuff, so at least you owe her money.", "How would you feel is she donated your stuff she deemed unnecessary?", "Excuse me, but who appointed you lord of all closet space? You are BOTH on the lease and paying equal rent therefore you both get equal say. You aren't in charge anymore and seem to be struggling to accept that. If you don't start treating your girlfriend with at least a modicum of respect, you'll get to have all of the closet space you want soon enough.", ">I like to have breathing room.\n\nAnd I bet your soon-to-be-exgf would like to have her stuff. You are an abusive thief who COULD have said \"Hey, let us find a saturday when none of us have plans and get this closet straightened out\", but instead you made the unilateral decision that YOU knew better than she did and that YOU had the right to get rid of her things.\nI hope she pays you back in kind.\n\nYTA", "You're gonna be single soon.", "You should live alone. You are so out of line.", "Why do you think your needs trump her needs so much, that you make unilateral decisions about her stuff?\n\n\"They aren't getting back in the closet\".\n\nHonestly you've learned nothing from this.", "You also aren't the type to be suitable for cohabitation or healthy long term relationships.\n\nYou overstepped massively. Why do you care what happens in her half of the closet? Keep your half organized as you want and she can do the same with hers. Your preferences aren't law, and you have no right to act in a such a controlling manner. She is an adult, who can make her win choices, and you have no right to give away her belongings.", "You sound unbelievably insufferable. I can't understand why she's even with you.", "YTA absolutely. I hope she drops you quickly. You did get rid of her belongings and you have no right to do this. Now you want to be a hero and take her to rescue her own clothes. You should take her out and buy her the same clothes new. You are a selfish idiot who wants to control someone you say you care about. Way to go, loser, you are going to lose this woman and you will continue to be one unless you mature and start thinking about others more than you think about yourself.", "Making excuses such as donating the stolen items aren't gonna make you a good human", "Go back now, you delusional asshole. Nice that YOU want breathing room but it is HER clothes and HER space as well... you have no say in what she has as clothes and yourself you keep your stupid shoes. \nNo one needs more than like 4 pairs of shoes so maybe donate your shoes if you want your breathing space.... \nThere would have been alternatives like getting boxes for seasonal wear you can just put under the bed or stuff like that.\nBut you do not donate other peoples belonging just because you felt like that. \nYou are not more important than her and regarding her clothes you have absolutely no say", "Then what's the point? \"Fine, I'll rescue some of your stuff that I threw out but you're not allowed to store it\"?\n\nMy god man. You are not ready to cohabit.", "If you did this with my personal belongings, you would an ex. YTA", "I sympathize with you. I really do. But you went about it the wrong way is all.", "It doesn't matter. It wasn't your stuff. You have no get out of jail free cared here.", ">or she didn't want to actually get rid of things\n\nThat should have been a choice she could make, and you took that from her. Look, you wanted faster action, but it doesn't change the fact that you threw out her things, which you had ZERO right to do. '\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I'm able to have my winter and summer clothes out without creating clutter, I assumed that would be the case for any adult\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou probably are not equipped to share space - or a life - with another person.", "She\u2019s mentioned donating your shoes, so that is okay now right?  Maybe she can sell them since you owe her money to replace her clothes.", "Why do you think you can determine how many articles of clothing she owns? Who are you to decide that? You had no right. YTA.", "Bravo, you have no clutter. want a sticker? Here's a reward. YTA. That's for you. You Thieving Asshole.\n\nYour gf is not you. All you did was STOLE your gf stuff and got rid of it. Violated her trust because you have some issue you want to deal with and just went  behind her back to do it. You had a problem? Looks like you were just trying do the passively aggressive approach then just took the aggressive approach rather being an adult. You acted like the kid who got fed up with something THEY didn't like.\n \nI would normally say turnabout is fair play but taking your stuff and throwing into a donation bin or whatever, would even come to close to betrayal you committed. You going back to thrift store, buying it all back wouldn't even start to build the trust again. I hope you like the single life cause you're not suited for the couple life. Willing to bet, she's looking for new accommodations that don't involve you.", "So you nagged her until she agreed and are *super shocked* she didn't follow through.   \n\nRemember that you think it's totally OK for someone to throw out others people stuff for when she tosses your possessions that the considers in the way.", "Are you your own girlfriend? I'm just wondering because you seem to think she is a mirror of you and can/wants to do everything you do. You do know she is a separate person with he own thoughts, feelings, and ideas, right? Because it sounds like you just think of her as an extension of yourself, which is really gross. I think you know by know YTA.", "Or it\u2019s not her priority. She doesn\u2019t have to do what you want, they way you want it. You don\u2019t get it. YTA.", "So you'll be totally fine with her throwing out some of your clothes without permission to clear up some additional space?", "Doesn\u2019t matter, you don\u2019t get rid of other peoples things without their permission. End of story", "Why is no one picking up that he is implying that his girlfriend is infantile for not following his way of creating a wardrobe?", "So you've never dated a girl before.", "No maybe. You are in the wrong for disposing of your girlfriend\u2019s clothes without permission.", "Exactly. I have some things in my closet I don\u2019t wear much because they are sentimental \n\nSome things are investment pieces that are basics/classic and won\u2019t go out of style.\n\nI am so mad on behalf of OP\u2019s GF", "Oh okay, so if a guy plays video games every day and his gf doesn\u2019t like that and talks about it for months to no avail, it\u2019s totally okay for her to donate his games and system then?", "Oops, I missed that, thank you!  Well, that makes him a bigger AH, doesn\u2019t it?", "Yes, exactly. This is also why breaking or throwing things is a danger sign because the message is \" if you don't obey me you could be next\".\nWhen you respect someone, OP, you respect their space, body, time, opinions, feelings, and belongings. It's all connected.", "It really is, if he wanted to get more space that much he could have gotten rid of HIS shoes, because I bet there a lot of them that he doesn't wear that much.", "I also feel like we cannot have this conversation without talking about the social expectations for male vs. female wardrobes. As an example, many men, in most (American) social circles, would have some reasonable overlap between what they wear to work, to a wedding, and to a funeral. Whereas you'd be hard-pressed to come up with a traditionally female-coded outfit that worked for all three events. Women just need\\* more clothing in a lot of social environments.\n\nAlso it sounds like he just straight up threw out her summer clothes, because she 'hadn't worn them in a while.' I would lose my gd mind.\n\n\\*I know not *need* need*.* But social expectations are thing, and women get judged way more harshly on deviating from sartorial rules. If I wore the same 5 outfits to work every week, someone would say something.", "She should totally go through his shoes and donate any pairs she doesnt see him wear that often. You know, to help him declutter.", "I didn't say that. And I'm not trying to justify OP throwing her stuff out without discussing hard details (date and time) with her first. \n\nAll I was pointing out was that OP has been wanting this cleaned up for months now and has talked with her about it several times.", "So what? He could have boxed up stuff and left it for her to sift through, he didn\u2019t do this.", "Yes, he could and should have done that.\n\nNot sure why you're so intent on arguing against me, I agree that he's an asshole."]}
