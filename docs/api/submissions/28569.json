She had no counter to that and knew it.", "NTA - You are allowed to have whoever you want with you when you are wedding dress shopping. If you wanted to invite the crazy cat lady who lives down the hall from you, invite her. Your mother is turning something that is about you into something about her.", "NTA, your mom is. Gatekeeping joy and happiness is the behavior of a seriously insecure person. Mom needs to figure out why she feels this way.", "NTA, it\u2019s your choice who is there. You are the bride. I think it\u2019s very sweet extending the invite to your future MIL and your mother was being selfish. Tell her you\u2019re sorry for the harsh words and that you do in fact want her there but it\u2019s your dress shopping and if she\u2019s going to bring anything but happy vibes then you\u2019d before she doesn\u2019t go.", "NTA.

These people who think of love as a zero sum game baffle me.", "she ruined it before it ever got ruined so I\u2019d say you\u2019re NTA. I can see she\u2019s jealous of you trying to include a woman she really doesnt know that well, but u could bring up how she didnt feel threatened by any other female going except for the one shes not related to. and i think you should bring up that one day if you have kids, THEY will be related to your mother in law, and thats another reason its extremely important for the three of you to have a good relationship all together. Maybe suggest going out to eat together and getting coffee or drinks and spending some time together. i would hope your mom would feel less threatened if she knows your mother in law is not trying to step in as a new mom to you, just trying to have fun by being included watching the future wife of his son try on dresses with her own loving family also surrounding her. just reassure her that theres no way anyone else would get in the way of the love and the special moments you and your mom have had and will continue to have together", "NTA Your mother has some serious selfishness going on. You did a lively thing by inviting your future mother-in-law. Don't let the selfishness ruin your day. Uninviting her would be cruel and for your mother to suggest it is ugly. Stand your ground. It is the moral high ground.", "NTA my Nan helped me find my dress. It\u2019s a memory I treasure. My mum wasn\u2019t there at all. While I do wonder if my mum felt a little off about it because it\u2019s such a unique experience I don\u2019t think she would have complained about sharing the experience. And we had a brilliant time together with everyone for the bridesmaids dresses and flowers and the decorations and table favours - there will be plenty of other things you could do with just her.", "NTA. It is so lovely of you to include your MIL. I included my MIL and it only made the moment more special. She didn\u2019t overstep or try to take anything from the other women present. When I found my wedding dress and veil, my MIL was the third person I hugged and we both had tears in our eyes. It was special and years later I\u2019m glad I included her.", "NTA, you mom knows she won\u2019t be able to help you try on dresses right? She\u2019ll just be sitting back with your other guests while you get help from a bridal associate.", "NTA I did the same thing. My MIL (who only had boys and who had never had this opportunity despite all sons being married), my mom, my grandmother, my sister and my best friend all went together. And everyone had fun. There\u2019s not a finite amount of joy in life, you don\u2019t run out. Share that stuff around!", "NTA. Oh my goodness, what is it with mothers or mothers-in-law or any kind of parent that just has to make things about them?", "NAH it does sound like a lot of people are coming along. Sounds like your mum\nmaybe had a different idea of what was happening (maybe based on her own experiences). This is a really special moment that she may well have been imagining for years. She\u2019s only human and is probably feeling a bit jealous and put out that she has to share this with this new mother figure in your life.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. You\u2019re not wrong but what is being right going to cost you? Is this the hill you want to die on? To fall out with your mum before your wedding?\n\nI don\u2019t know if hat your relationship is like but if it\u2019s otherwise loving and healthy I would try and mend this \n\nYou can have more than one dress shopping trip btw. I had about 4 before I found my dress.  Have you considered spreading these out with different guests, narrowing it down to a few favourites then taking whoever you prefer to the finale?  Also, having a lot of people there is often more hindrance then help\u2026.", "NAH. The wedding is your moment and you should be allowed to choose who helps you with it along the way. And if for you it's so important that your MIL is there, then she should be and nobody else has a say in the matter. \n\nHowever, I also do understand your mother. Traditionally, dress picking is a bonding moment between the bride-to-be and the women in her family, especially the mom. It's a special occasion and it is understandable for her to feel sidelined when asked to share this moment. \n\nOverall, I think it's mostly a misunderstanding. Maybe try sending a message to your mother explaining exactly why it's so important for you to have your MIL there. Maybe talk about the fact that she never got to experience something like that and got sidelined herself at her last son's wedding. \n\nYou already apologized for your words, so I don't think there's much to do on that front, but maybe try apologizing again once everyone has cooled down.", "ESH \n\nShe was wrong by putting herself before you on this day, but you went way too far with your reply, and don't come at me saying that her actions excuse yours too. \n\nApologize in a day, once she calmed down and tell that she's still the most important female figure (?) And that your mil won't take her place, but that she needs to understand that your mil is important to you too, and that she has to accept her presence in your life. \n\nI also wonder if there's other situations happening where you \"prioritized\" your mil and your mom may have just gone out on you about this just because she was frustrated about other issues. Maybe ask her if there's something that you did before that disappointed her...\n\nI believe that after an open heart talk, everything will end up well. \n\nBtw  congrats on your wedding !", "ESH. \n\nI get where you're both coming from. It was very sweet to invite your FMIL to come wedding dress shopping with you. Your mom is being ridiculous, wedding dress shopping doesn't equal any of the other special moments in a wedding.

But on this thread plenty of people will say she is one, so enjoy if that's what you were looking for.\n\nIt's nice for you to consider inviting your future MIL.

She probably had been looking forward to it much longer than your MIL has, and you basically told her her job could be filled by any willing female. That must have stung, to be told you\u2019re so easily replaceable in your own daughters life.", "YTA - You could have simply told her that you wanted to share this moment with her and your future MIL would not an could not ever take her place.

It's only the \"new addition\" to your group of supportive women your mom is targeting, the only member of your fianc\u00e8's family.\n\nThis is 100% your mom's problem of her own creation. She's using the manipulation tactic of making your choice a trigger for her bad feelings, which you're pressured to feel obligated to \"fix\" by hurting your future MIL and the relationship between you. \n\nThe problem here is that your mom is weaponizing your wedding events to emotionally hurt and manipulate you using factors completely in her mind which only she can regulate/control. Her manipulation, injecting her drama into YOUR event, and open attack on your MIL and her place in your life are HER actions, HER choices and HER responsibility. Your marriage should be your primary relationship. Yes, your mom will now be \"extended family\" equal in importance to your MIL to you and your husband. Love and respect as an adult child towards a parent does NOT include obedience, as if you were still a child under her authority.

If she chooses to resist and hurt her own feelings about your new family configuration, that's HER issue, no one else's.", "NTA. Something is fishy about your mom's reasoning.

Stop letting your mother shade you with guilt. She is  being overly selfish. Why isn't she made about any of the other women attending? Because someone in the family would get upset about it.

Your mother was trying to gatekeep the experience,  and forgot she already had her wedding, and this one is yours. I do think you have too many people going (more than 4 or 5 becomes too many opinions really fast), but that isn't the issue here.  Weddings bring out the absolute worst in some people. When people want to push you or argue, don't engage. Say, \"This is what I've decided on. I hope you'll be able to enjoy the day with me, but if you decide not to come, it's totally fine and I won't hold it against you.\"\n\nLeave the ball in their court to make their own decision, without engaging in escalation or ultimatum that allow the other person to claim victim hood.", "NTA.

It isn't Walmart where you will shove yourself into a dressing room and will yell if you need help. She and the other will be sat down *outside of the dressing room* while you try on dresses and pick which you like enough to want to show them as options.", "NTA at all. I'm actually going dress shopping with my MIL this week and my mom isn't able to come. Your mom should be focused on the experience and not worried about her insecurities.

I had my now motherinlaws and sisterinlaw at mine.", "I do think your mom needs to share, but it's worth mentioning that there is one major distinction between your MIL and the rest of the women present.  Your MIL is only well acquainted with you, and not everyone else there (everyone else knows each other).  So I think your mom's feeling that her presence could impinge on the interactions she's been anticipating having with you are not entirely unrealistic.\n\nRegardless, this is your event.  But it seems apparent to me that your mom wants to be reminded that she's irreplaceable to you.  I don't know what the context of your relationship is, but if she's not usually unreasonable or demanding, I would try to approach this situation with extra grace and understanding.", "NTA\n\nYou should bring who is going to make you happy and make this a day of happiness for you. \n\nThere is no room for jealousy or negative emotions and lack of being unable to share.", "NTA- she needs to learn that this is YOUR time. YOUR moment. YOUR wedding. If she gets this upset about it, who knows what else she will want to control as you continue in your wedding planning. \n\nI\u2019ll give her the benefit of the doubt though. If you\u2019re her only daughter, then maybe that\u2019s why she is being extra possessive of you and of this moment.

The MIL just being there isn\u2019t going to take anything away from that.", "She only regrets what she said in the argument.\n\nHer offer to her future MIL is not taking from her mother.\nHer mother has that in her head.", "Why would she need to pitch the idea to her mom first?", "Op not wrong and the mom tried to play a power move. She wanted op to pick her over mil.", ">You could have simply told her that you wanted to share this moment with her and your future MIL would not an could not ever take her place.\n\nThat *is* what OP said. But the mom continued to put up a fight about it.", "Your mom is okay with having your step-mom there but not your FMIL...it seems like she's being a bit petty.  NTA", "My daughter brought her future MIL, and we had a great time! BTW, there's a consultant who helps you with the dresses. Your mom is being petty. NTA and have fun!!", "NTA having MiL and mom there is pretty normal and your mom is being weird for being so against it. \n\n\u201cI mentioned im bringing her (my mom), my grandmother, my sister, my godmothers, my step mother, and my mother in law.\u201d  Why is your mom ok with all the other women who could , according to her, take away from a moment between you and her but not MiL? They\u2019re all other women in the family? It\u2019s not exactly different. I\u2019m not sure what your mom\u2019s actual issue with the problem is but your NTA, it\u2019s your wedding and you get to decide who comes dress shopping with you.", "Not the person you're replying to, but same situation. It was absolutely wonderful, we had a lovely experience, I bought the dress I found with her. It was a great bonding moment and I know it meant so much to her.", "Great, my mil kept a bit background, but my mom pushed her to the front row. They hit it of marvellous!", "I invited both my future mother-in-law and future step-mother-in-law. My FMIL didn\u2019t come but FSMIL did. She and my mom get along really well so it went great. Had my FMIL come it might have been a bit tense as she\u2019s a bit awkward, especially around FSMIL but no one would have said anything. It seems like your mom might be either insecure or a bit petty in regards to your MIL.", "Not original commenter, but I had my MIL at mine for the same reasons as you (only has sons) as well as my mom, sister, and niece. Everyone had a great time! We had champagne.", "I brought my MIL (also no daughters) and the only thing was I had to tell her no pictures. She kept trying to take some but I know she has a tendency to show her mom and sister everything and it would\u2019ve spread to the whole family. Other than that she was mostly fine, then for my first fitting I only brought my sister and niece to make it a younger generation day. My mom was fine with it since we\u2019ve done the same thing for multiple family weddings/dress shopping now.", "[deleted]", "I went alone and picked my gown out on a lunch hour.  It was perfect and low drama/stress.", "Yeah. I also can see how having the future MIL there changes the dynamic because she doesn't know the rest of the group. If you want to do it, that's fine, but I also can see why OP's mom wants it to be special for them. In my case, my mom and MIL don't like each other, so I've tried to limit their interactions to save everyone the headache.", "She didn\u2019t complain about grandmother, godmothers, or stepmother. It\u2019s asinine to complain about MIL.", "Because traditionally it\u2019s a mother/daughter thing? \n\nshe perhaps had built this up  as the last time she gets to bond with her child without competing interests. \n\nNo one really warns you that you have a child-then you just don\u2019t. \n\nThat leaves lot of time to fill, and it\u2019s hard to make new social connections in middle age.", "Not only Petty, she's being a AH. The day is not about her and now she has bothered OP for no reason. Even if she comes, now OP will be nervous because her mom might decide to create drama on the day.", "This.\n\nUnless its some really special moment she has been waiting a decade for, but I don't think that is the case. It's also a great opportunity to get to know the in-laws. Families that make that kind of extra effort are usually amazing.", "That would be the case if mom had a problem with everyone else going. It\u2019s just the future mother in law she\u2019s having a problem with. Hell OP is bringing Her step mother but that\u2019s fine to mom", "One last moment? OP isn't dying or going anywhere. The hyperbole is strong here", "\n\nComfort levels with an interloper vary greatly between individuals, and that\u2019s a pretty immutable  trait. \n\nIf mom is shy, or even just an introvert, a relative stranger can suck the joy out of the occasion. The need to force small talk is so energy zapping.\n\nAnd maybe just maybe mom dislikes MIL and dreads spending time with the woman. \n\nOr maybe she\u2019s just seeing her future where she gets her daughter and her family half of the time, and is sad. Probably less than that, because apparently husband comes from large family, so his obligations will be higher. \n\nWe don\u2019t know, but mom has my sympathy. \nShe\u2019s allowed to be disappointed.", "I thoughts it\u2019s traditional for the MIL to attend wedding dress shopping. So it\u2019s fine the mom feel sad and wants this but no way is OP required to change anything because her mom has feelings.", "She knew from the beginning she was not winning the battle of my step mother not going. My step mother and I are much closer than me and my biological mother. I\u2019m also much closer to my\nGrandmother and godmothers. So she already knew those people would not be negotiable. And my sister is my literal best friend.", "Yeah, it\u2019s still super weird. Mom is definitely being very selfish and narcissistic with this one. You\u2019d think she\u2019d be happy that the daughter isn\u2019t entering a family with a mean MIL. Although the mom probably would want the mean MIL, so that she doesn\u2019t have to share. \n\nAlso what does mom expect the wedding to be like? You know, the actual event where her daughter and the fianc\u00e9\u2019s family merge.", ">Comfort levels with an interloper vary greatly between individuals\n\nYeah and on this occasion, the bride's comfort levels are important, not her mother's.", "I guess it depends where you are from.\n\nBut she\u2019s still the AH for telling her mom she doesn\u2019t matter, especially when she\u2019s obviously vulnerable. She could have used different words.", "I\u2019m 100% on your side I didn\u2019t do the whole go try on dresses for my wedding I got something custom but I included my mother in law also. If it makes you happy go for it. This is a hopeful once in a life time thing", "Then the only thing you're guilty of is telling your mom the unvarnished truth. \n\nIn which case, maybe reconsider apologizing; this seems like the perfect place for one of those non-apology apologies.\n\n\"Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.\" \n\nBecause that's really all you should be sorry for.", "[deleted]", "Well there you have it.  There is a reason you are closer to your step-mother.  Maybe you were a bit harsh, but with all those people, that is an odd line in the sand for your mom to draw.  She either accepts your apology and comes or doesn't.  Either way have a great time - it is wonderful to have all those people in your life!", "The wedding is about the merging of families. Shopping for the wedding gown is about the bride, so I think they're different. Mom expects to share this with her daughter not with her daughter's future MIL, who Mom may not know well.", "If 2016 taught me anything, it\u2019s there are people on this planet I would prefer to never interact with ever again, and I plan my life around avoiding them when possible. Life\u2019s too short. \n\nI really wonder if the issue isn\u2019t maybe personal. \nSharing is bad enough, but we all have that person it\u2019s just falling to share with.", "True. \nIt\u2019s absolutely bride\u2019s ultimate decision.\n\nI wonder if moms feelings are ever given priority over MIL. \n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to take advantage of those we assume will always cave because they love us. \n\nAnd it\u2019s really not uncommon for women to butter up in-laws. \n\nUltimately mom will usually come up the loser and it\u2019s probably best to temper expectations.", "Definitely a once in a lifetime \ud83e\ude75", "OP didn't uninvite her mom, just said she didn't have to go if it would ruin her day. She put it in the mom's hands to attend or not.", "You actually hit the nail on the head there. It\u2019s about the Bride. And the Bride wants her future MIL there. MIL being there does not hinder or take away from her Mom being involved in the moment. Mom is just being selfish and petty trying to exclude MIL.", "Lol I get your 2016 drift I think. And while your hypothetical situation would give the mom some leeway, from what OP presented that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening here. \n\nMom is just selfish and trying to make her daughter\u2019s wedding dress shopping about herself, instead of focusing on her daughter. There could be an update where your suspicions turn out to be right, and there is a personal conflict between Mom and MIL. But it really seems like it\u2019s as simple as Mom is just selfish and petty.", "It's your wedding and honestly, you could have half the cast of Ben Hur go along dress shopping and I'd STILL say it's entirely your call!\n\nNTA. Sounds like maybe your mom regrets not being closer to you, but while you're planning your wedding is not the time for her to get all up in her feelings. I mean, she can, but she doesn't have the right to ruin things for you because of it.", "Selfishness usually presupposes mom has a personality disorder. Nothing suggests that.\n\nOn Reddit-all women have personality disorders. That doesn\u2019t translate to life.", "I did not say anything about a personality disorder or am I implying there is one. I\u2019m talking about this situation and her actions alone. I never referenced \u201call woman\u201d or what personality disorders Reddit loves to assign. You might be responding to the wrong comment.", "No, but it\u2019s always She\u2019\u2019 toxic! She\u2019s a narcissist! \nScrew the B!! She deserves her misery. \n\nGranted Reddit is all teenagers."]}
