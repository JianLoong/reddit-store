We\u2019re both close to our families. His mother had 3 boys and never had a daughter. When my fianc\u00e9s brother was getting married she was not involved in any part of the wedding planning. She never complained or said anything but also would have enjoyed it. \n\nI\u2019m going to pick out my dress this weekend. I was really excited about it and was talking to her about it while we were at my in laws home on Saturday. I then told her it would mean a lot to me if she came with me. She got teary eyed and agreed to come. \n\nI was so excited to share this moment with my family and the woman who means the most to my fianc\u00e9. \n\nI was talking to my mother on Sunday and we were talking about the excitement of going to pick out my dress this weekend. I mentioned im bringing her (my mom), my grandmother, my sister, my godmothers, my step mother, and my mother in law. \n\nMy mom asked why I was bringing my mother in law and I explained I wanted her to enjoy the moment with us and start all making memories together since we\u2019ll be family. My mom said she didn\u2019t want her to come since she feels like she\u2019ll take away from a moment between her and I. I assured her that wouldn\u2019t happen.\n\nWe argued about it back and forth and this is where I might be the AH. I said if something that petty is going to ruin your day or my day then you don\u2019t have to go. Then she said well who\u2019s going to help you get it on and have those moments with you and I said any other female figure in my life who\u2019s going will do just fine. She got upset and I regretted saying it. \n\nI did try apologizing but she\u2019s not responding. So AITA?\n\nUpdate: \n\nMy mother decided to let me know she will not be coming dress shopping since I\u2019m taking the moment away with her only daughter. I let her know that was okay and I respected her decision. \n\nShe then called my dad (her ex husband of 20 years) to let him know what HIS DAUGHTER was doing. I happened to be at his house but she didn\u2019t know that. My dad very sarcastically responded with \u201coh no our daughter is getting married and she loves her mother in law and wants to extend an invitation to something she\u2019ll otherwise never get to experience. How dare we raise her to be a good human. How awful and you should ground our 30 year old who hasn\u2019t lived at home in 12 years. Do you know how silly you sound?\u201d\n\nPretty sure that made her more angry. But it made me laugh. \n\nI decided to switch the boutiques so that she cannot show up the day of and cause any unnecessary drama. Luckily my mother in law doesn\u2019t know any of this is happening and my mother has no way to contact her.", "created_utc": 1696860819, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/173sv63/aita_for_telling_my_mother_she_didnt_have_to_come/", "score": 1868, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can see she\u2019s jealous of you trying to include a woman she really doesnt know that well, but u could bring up how she didnt feel threatened by any other female going except for the one shes not related to. and i think you should bring up that one day if you have kids, THEY will be related to your mother in law, and thats another reason its extremely important for the three of you to have a good relationship all together. Maybe suggest going out to eat together and getting coffee or drinks and spending some time together. i would hope your mom would feel less threatened if she knows your mother in law is not trying to step in as a new mom to you, just trying to have fun by being included watching the future wife of his son try on dresses with her own loving family also surrounding her. just reassure her that theres no way anyone else would get in the way of the love and the special moments you and your mom have had and will continue to have together", "NTA Your mother has some serious selfishness going on. You did a lively thing by inviting your future mother-in-law. Don't let the selfishness ruin your day. Uninviting her would be cruel and for your mother to suggest it is ugly. Stand your ground. It is the moral high ground.", "NTA my Nan helped me find my dress. It\u2019s a memory I treasure. My mum wasn\u2019t there at all. While I do wonder if my mum felt a little off about it because it\u2019s such a unique experience I don\u2019t think she would have complained about sharing the experience. And we had a brilliant time together with everyone for the bridesmaids dresses and flowers and the decorations and table favours - there will be plenty of other things you could do with just her.", "NTA. It is so lovely of you to include your MIL. I included my MIL and it only made the moment more special. She didn\u2019t overstep or try to take anything from the other women present. When I found my wedding dress and veil, my MIL was the third person I hugged and we both had tears in our eyes. It was special and years later I\u2019m glad I included her.", "NTA, you mom knows she won\u2019t be able to help you try on dresses right? She\u2019ll just be sitting back with your other guests while you get help from a bridal associate.", "NTA I did the same thing. My MIL (who only had boys and who had never had this opportunity despite all sons being married), my mom, my grandmother, my sister and my best friend all went together. And everyone had fun. There\u2019s not a finite amount of joy in life, you don\u2019t run out. Share that stuff around!", "NTA. Oh my goodness, what is it with mothers or mothers-in-law or any kind of parent that just has to make things about them?", "NAH it does sound like a lot of people are coming along. Sounds like your mum\nmaybe had a different idea of what was happening (maybe based on her own experiences). This is a really special moment that she may well have been imagining for years. She\u2019s only human and is probably feeling a bit jealous and put out that she has to share this with this new mother figure in your life.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing. You\u2019re not wrong but what is being right going to cost you? Is this the hill you want to die on? To fall out with your mum before your wedding?\n\nI don\u2019t know if hat your relationship is like but if it\u2019s otherwise loving and healthy I would try and mend this \n\nYou can have more than one dress shopping trip btw. I had about 4 before I found my dress.  Have you considered spreading these out with different guests, narrowing it down to a few favourites then taking whoever you prefer to the finale?  Also, having a lot of people there is often more hindrance then help\u2026.", "NAH. The wedding is your moment and you should be allowed to choose who helps you with it along the way. And if for you it's so important that your MIL is there, then she should be and nobody else has a say in the matter. \n\nHowever, I also do understand your mother. Traditionally, dress picking is a bonding moment between the bride-to-be and the women in her family, especially the mom. It's a special occasion and it is understandable for her to feel sidelined when asked to share this moment. \n\nOverall, I think it's mostly a misunderstanding. Maybe try sending a message to your mother explaining exactly why it's so important for you to have your MIL there. Maybe talk about the fact that she never got to experience something like that and got sidelined herself at her last son's wedding. \n\nYou already apologized for your words, so I don't think there's much to do on that front, but maybe try apologizing again once everyone has cooled down.", "ESH \n\nShe was wrong by putting herself before you on this day, but you went way too far with your reply, and don't come at me saying that her actions excuse yours too. \n\nApologize in a day, once she calmed down and tell that she's still the most important female figure (?) And that your mil won't take her place, but that she needs to understand that your mil is important to you too, and that she has to accept her presence in your life. \n\nI also wonder if there's other situations happening where you \"prioritized\" your mil and your mom may have just gone out on you about this just because she was frustrated about other issues. Maybe ask her if there's something that you did before that disappointed her...\n\nI believe that after an open heart talk, everything will end up well. \n\nBtw  congrats on your wedding !", "ESH. \n\nI get where you're both coming from. It was very sweet to invite your FMIL to come wedding dress shopping with you. Your mom is being ridiculous, wedding dress shopping doesn't equal any of the other special moments in a wedding.

Hope you really meant all that, because **those comments can't be un-said or forgotten.** Your mother's not an asshole for being sad about having to share a moment that a lot of mothers/daughters do think is special. But on this thread plenty of people will say she is one, so enjoy if that's what you were looking for.\n\nIt's nice for you to consider inviting your future MIL.

It's only the \"new addition\" to your group of supportive women your mom is targeting, the only member of your fianc\u00e8's family.\n\nThis is 100% your mom's problem of her own creation. She's using the manipulation tactic of making your choice a trigger for her bad feelings, which you're pressured to feel obligated to \"fix\" by hurting your future MIL and the relationship between you. \n\nThe problem here is that your mom is weaponizing your wedding events to emotionally hurt and manipulate you using factors completely in her mind which only she can regulate/control. Her manipulation, injecting her drama into YOUR event, and open attack on your MIL and her place in your life are HER actions, HER choices and HER responsibility. Your marriage should be your primary relationship. Yes, your mom will now be \"extended family\" equal in importance to your MIL to you and your husband. Love and respect as an adult child towards a parent does NOT include obedience, as if you were still a child under her authority.

If she chooses to resist and hurt her own feelings about your new family configuration, that's HER issue, no one else's.", "NTA. Something is fishy about your mom's reasoning.

Salons don\u2019t want random people doing that job as they could damage/dirty the sample dresses, and the sales clerks use special clips to \u2018size\u2019 the sample to the bride to show how the final product would likely fit.

Stop letting your mother shade you with guilt. She is  being overly selfish. Why isn't she made about any of the other women attending? Because someone in the family would get upset about it.

Your mother was trying to gatekeep the experience,  and forgot she already had her wedding, and this one is yours. I do think you have too many people going (more than 4 or 5 becomes too many opinions really fast), but that isn't the issue here.  Weddings bring out the absolute worst in some people. When people want to push you or argue, don't engage. Say, \"This is what I've decided on. I hope you'll be able to enjoy the day with me, but if you decide not to come, it's totally fine and I won't hold it against you.\"\n\nLeave the ball in their court to make their own decision, without engaging in escalation or ultimatum that allow the other person to claim victim hood.", "NTA.

Your MIL is only well acquainted with you, and not everyone else there (everyone else knows each other).  So I think your mom's feeling that her presence could impinge on the interactions she's been anticipating having with you are not entirely unrealistic.\n\nRegardless, this is your event.  But it seems apparent to me that your mom wants to be reminded that she's irreplaceable to you.

If you\u2019re her only daughter, then maybe that\u2019s why she is being extra possessive of you and of this moment.

Miserable, jealous. How fun.", "mom is petty and immature and she had better get used to it. SHE is not the one getting married.", "And if she grew up to be this considerate and emphatic with her MIL! This had everything to be a wholesome moment", "I don't know. I have heard stories where someone's heart suddenly exploded because they got too much love. On second thought, I think it was from too much cocaine. Lots of love is probably fine.", "Ho-hum. I think you had the opportunity to speak to your mom with kindness before the dress appointment but you took every opportunity to exclude her thereby confirming in her mind that she is not wanted. This is something she has looked forward to forever, much like FMIL. Yes, she was hypersensitive, but you could have fixed it with hand-holding and an \"I love you most\". Instead, you changed the boutique, got your dad in on it and the whole thing is blown out of proportion. I'm not saying you are an AH. But I'm not saying Mom is an AH either. Weddings are stressful enough and sometimes sugar fixes things a lot better than vinegar. It doesn't have to be about who is right. I hope you buy her flowers and apologize and fix this before it gets worse. Someday you may really regret your behavior.", "Yta u r awful. Uts a mother daughter thing. U have disrespected your mother.  Your mil will not choose u over any of her own kid.   Congrats on hurting your mom", "ESH. If only you could show as much compassion to your mother as you do your MIL.", "I get it, but I also think you\u2019re lacking empathy for your mom. This may be an unpopular opinion. I noticed a couple subtleties that sound bratty and immature (imo). Like you and your MIL are BFFs  and you\u2019re giving your mom the finger. And your dad kind of mocking her and you laughing. Idk I don\u2019t know your family or your dynamic and that\u2019s obviously hard to portray by text\u2026I think that matters sometimes. But idk maybe put yourself in her shoes a bit.", "NTA. My (now) wife did a fitting at home, with a dress she got online (covid, prices, whatever). Every step of the way she included my mum (I'm a masculine type lady who wore a dashing suit), at the fitting party it was at our house and they all had a great day; mother in law, sister in law and the other bridesmaid. (I was told to go away, so I went to the movies with my brides-dudes). \n\nI thought it was the sweetest thing in the world that my wife included my mum in all these steps that my mum would have otherwise missed out on as my brother is going to live in the shed forever, a hermit with no wife. \n\nThat you're doing this for your MIL means you are kind and thoughtful and generous. Unsure what it says about your mum, so sorry about her.", "I had my mom, sister and mother-in-law come with me. I brought my mother-in-law because we have a wonderful relationship and her only daughter passed away in a car accident at 19 and will never get to experience the excitement of those milestones with her own daughter. It was the least I could do and I'm so lucky my mom and and mother-in-law get along so well (they've been on vacations without us). I also split up my father/daughter dance at my wedding with my bio dad, step-dad and father-in-law. \n\nSo no, you're NTA. You're mom is very much the AH and has the emotional maturity of a potato. Your mother-in-law is lucky to have you, these things mean more than we'll ever know to them.", "Sounds like your mother has main character syndrome. Hopefully this will be all the drama involving her and your wedding, but I doubt it. She's the real AH.", "NTA. She has no issue with other people being there, she\u2019s just being jealous and unkind to your MIL.", "Bless you for being a decent person. Nta", "Soooooo NTA, and your dad is awesome.", "Hmmm...odd...your Mom has a problem with your Mother-In-Law coming, but doesn't have a problem with your *Step*-mother coming??\ud83e\udd14 That seems strange to me, and sounds like it should be reversed! Oh and NTA.", "Nta. Mom sounds controlling and narcissistic. Good luck.", "NTA- at all! I brought my ex MIL shopping with me too, because I knew it meant a LOT to her. I\u2019m so glad I did. Even though I divorced her son we still get along great and she watches our kiddo every time we ask. She is a real gem of a woman. Your dad sounds like a great guy, and I\u2019m sorry about your mom. Mine can be a nightmare but at least she didn\u2019t try to make my wedding about her.", "NTA - I think you and your dad handled it wonderfully. At the end of the day, it's about you and your future. If your mom can't be happy with you right by your side, then she won't be happy regardless.", "NTA. It\u2019s pretty customary to include the MIL unless you actively hate them or their taste.", "NTA!!\n\nCongratulations on the upcoming wedding!", "Have a wonderful day. Funny note. I bought the very first dress I picked and tried on. Never even tried another.  It was quick and we went shopping for the rest of the accessories and had a delicious lunch. Make it what you desire it\u2019s one of your special days. \ud83c\udf38", "NTA. I brought my mom, sister, best friend and MIL and we all had a good time. My mom is less expressive but my MIL cried, which did make me feel good about the dress. We all had a memorable afternoon and that was that. \n\nNobody has to gatekeep anything, the big day for me was the wedding and it was more important that everyone was considerate of ME (the bride) and wedding day and got along with each other and 0 drama. \n\nAnyone who caused a fuss I literally stonewalled and went NC till the wedding because we don\u2019t entertain nonsense in this house.", "YTA not for inviting your MIL but for how you treated your mother", "NTA", "i like your dad. btw i cant understand how she is against MIL and not against stepmother. usually that is where the bitterness comes into play. but who knows whats going through her head i guess. NTA eitherway", "I can't even IMAGINE missing my child's wedding dress shopping because I couldn't have the day all to myself. I may feel a little sad if I didn't get along with the MIL, but I would NEVER give up that opportunity, and I wouldn't even dare suggest that she not invite someone! It's HER day! NTA Op, and I'm so sad that your mom has made this choice.", "Your dad sounds awesome. NTA", "Nta. If you're one of the lucky ones, you will gain another mother.", "NTA \nI brought my Mum, daughter and MIL with me. And it was a great way for them to get to know each other. As well as being something MIL wouldn't otherwise experience. \nMy MIL ended up being the one who picked out my dress as it was a different style than I was initially looking for and she encouraged me to try it on", "NTA. If I was getting married I would totally bring my MIL dress shopping. Even if she had other daughters. Why wouldn\u2019t you want her there if you have a good relationship with her? She\u2019s just there to watch and give opinions like everyone else going there is\u2026", "I didn't take anyone.  I've been married 22 years, and I still hear about it.", "Yeah! All the mother cared about was how important she will be on her daughter's day. Also, it's kind of suspicious that she didn't care about all the other ladies from the family being there. She had a problem with just the mother-in-law.", "Dad always goes gangsta for his little girls \ud83e\ude75", "Yeah, OP spent a long time talking about MIL in the post and their 'tearful momentary then anything with their mom was like a footnote. I wonder if they have a bad relationship before this but otherwise it's clear by the post where OP's focus is. Making a big deal and actually backing out was also something thay didn't have to happen so I'll actually go ESH.", "So here\u2019s the thing. It\u2019s not me lacking empathy for her. It\u2019s the point that it\u2019s my wedding and I want my mother in law there. She\u2019s my fianc\u00e9s mother and this is just as much his wedding as it is mine. She had her wedding and got to do what she wanted. As for my father I don\u2019t know what kind of response she was expecting. She went to her ex husband of 20 years (my parents have never gotten along) and then decided to try to complain to him about me. My dad is my biggest cheerleader and thought the gesture was nice.", "It sounds like she prefers her MIL. I don't know, maybe she does or maybe this behaviour is common with their mom. But OP went on for a long time about their MIL, her history, the invite and tearful bonding moment, and then list her bio family like they were a footnote.", "I did this too, and like yours my mom had a shit fit about it. I\u2019m sorry. It sucks. My MIL has four sons, I thought it would be nice to invite her.\n\nFor me, my engagement was the start of a rapid worsening of my relationship with my mother. She was clinging to the idea of us as nuclear family and resented all of these strangers that were now very important to me. We got married. We had a baby. She can\u2019t seem to be normal and share her grandchildren. She gets angry when we trade off holidays with both sides of the family. She\u2019s now openly hostile to my lovely in laws.\n\nIt\u2019s jealous and possessive and I think she was like this all along.\n\nI really hope your mom comes to her senses. Mine has just gotten worse with time, and I have had to mourn the relationship I thought we would have at this stage in our lives.", "I also brought my MIL with me, as she'd otherwise never get to have the experience. But dress shopping went really well.\n\nWhat didn't go so well was the rest of my life lol. My mom sounds JUST LIKE YOURS. Like to this day, she still feels like it's some type of competition with my MIL. It gets worse when you have kids. I try to avoid seeing my mom as much as possible.", "I know. I can see why hermother is hurt.", "And her godmothers. It might be different if it was something that was originally just the op and mom, but it never was. And even if that were the case, it's still supposed to be all about the op. NTA", "Also to note, A LOT of boutiques now will assign each bride an attendant who is the one to help her put on each dress and apply the clips in the back etc. \n\nThey do this because they can quickly do up the fasteners bc they are familiar with the dresses, but also it prevents dresses from getting destroyed or damaged by brides or their \u201chelpers\u201d. \n\nSo I assume, unless there are extreme special circumstances (perhaps she has scarring, or is a SA victim who cannot be undressed with anyone other than their safe person) for the bride and there is a pre-appointment agreement made, then OPs mom is just throwing a fit about something she wouldn\u2019t be doing anyway. \n\nAlso, if mom wanted her \u201chelp daughter into dress\u201d moment, that comes at the wedding usually with the other bridesmaid\u2019s or whoever she picked. There is no special moment when you\u2019re trying on 15 dresses. Lol \n\n\nSo yup, I agree, definitely petty and jealous/possessive. I think she knows how much she loves her future mil and feels threatened.", "exactly my thoughts", "I went by myself. I was very invested in getting the best deal on everything for my wedding as I had limited funds, so I did a lot of online and magazine shopping to find the best options. I went to an enormous discount bridal shop in Manhattan (RK Bridal) that carried pretty much everything to try on the ones I had picked out (plus a couple of others that caught my eye.) Then I ordered the dress I wanted from a local shop that gave me the best deal. I did bring my mom with me to try it on for alterations. I wish I had been able to bring my MiL with me, but she died of cancer three weeks after we got engaged. I'm just glad she knew that her son was going to be happy (he had a terrible first marriage and my MiL **HATED** his 1st wife.)", "I only have a son; but my (hopefully) future DiL is amazing and I would truly love to be a part of all the lead up to the wedding with her, although I also would understand if she made it just for her mum & other women in her life. I would never ask her, but being part of that would just be so special. \n\nAs a future MiL, I am so appreciative of all the awesome women like you & OP that are willing to share such things with their MiLs.", "You have an amazing heart! \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96 they will be so grateful for that. I promise. I was told \"marry a man who's mother is dead or he doesn't speak to her.\" We met and just bonded immediately. I never had a biological mother so I think she was meant to be mine! I always tell my husband if we divorce I'm taking her with me! She's my partner in crime lol!"]}
