I, 22F, and my husband, 23M, took in my brother, 19M, and his girlfriend,18F,  early November 2022 when they were kicked out of their last apartment due to \u201cdisagreements\u201d with their previous roommates. I won\u2019t get into detail about their business but any and all friendships were broken between them and their ex roommates. It wasn\u2019t an easy decision to let them move in. My brother was not easy to grow up with, he was constantly in trouble, stealing, lying, causing problems at school. I didn\u2019t want to trust him in my apartment especially when me and my husband weren\u2019t home, but if I didn\u2019t let him move in he would\u2019ve been on the streets. One of the few rules that we had for them was my brother had to get a job within the first month or they had to find another place to live. He got a job within the first two weeks which I was like hey, he\u2019s turning his life around. He lost it after only a week. Says he got fired cause they found a \u201cbetter person for the job\u201d but I knew that was a lie since I used to work for the company and they were always hiring because they couldn\u2019t get people to stay with them long enough. He found another job where his girlfriend works but he only works a few days a week. We were already having issues with them living with us, but nothing major but come Christmas time they announce that she is pregnant. Me and my husband are beyond pissed off at this point because they could barely afford what we charged them for rent and how would they afford to have a baby when they couldn\u2019t afford their own place. \n\nSo now come the new year, my husband and I are struggling to make ends meet. I have been out of a job since late October, my new job starting in less than two weeks. If we hadn\u2019t taken the two of them in we would have been fine on just my husbands income. We took money out of our bank accounts to pay rent for this month. My husband had it in his pocket when he went to the bathroom and had accidentally left the money in there. It hasn\u2019t been more than a few hours of it being in there when he noticed and went to grab it. 40 dollars went missing. I didn\u2019t take it, my husband didn\u2019t take it, and nobody else has access to our apartment besides my brother and his girlfriend. My husband already confronted my brother over the phone since he was on his way to work and I was going to sleep, he works third shift, and my brother denied it up and down. I\u2019m done and tomorrow, or should I say later today, I\u2019m going to tell them they have until the end of the month to get out and I don\u2019t care where they go but I will not tolerate them stealing from me when we went out of our way to help them when they were going to be homeless. They knew this would be temporary, when they first moved in they were given a timeframe of 3-5 months to get their own place.

If they don't appreciate it and steal from you, that's on them...", "NTA. They got eight or so months to sort something out for the future possible kid, they'll be fine.", "NTA\n\nthey stole from you after you let them stay with you.\n\nweather the money was in his pants or on a counter just laying there, they should not tough it, t's not theirs.\n\nI wouldn't give htem even a month but kick them out right away \n\nthey could do much worse than just steal $40 in a month.", "obviously nta. This is an unfortunate situation for you, because even if you prove he does any damage to your apartment he won't have the money to cover it. Have you considered calling the girl's parents? Having a plan worked out and available for them may reduce the odds of them being violent.", "NTA it can be rough to live with unappreciative little pricks. I know this to be true as I once was one, and later took in some.  \n\n\nFrom personal experience, I was homeless for 51 weeks to the day many years ago and honestly it was probably the best thing for me. I've since dramatically turned my life around, so much so that I now have a mantra every time I'm going through something difficult:  I'm thankful for my struggles, as without them I wouldn't know my strength.", "NTA, OP. Remember, no good deed goes unpunished, as they say.", "NTA you're being fair. You told them at the start this was temporary and you've given them a standard amount of time to leave.\n\nThey got themselves pregnant when they were in this position, or could have known before they moved in if they were announcing at Christmas. That's not your fault.", "NTA but do you really want to have them in your apartment for the rest of the month, helping themselves to more of your money, jewelry or whatever else they might find handy?", "NTA.  Not only the theft is an issue. The fact that brother will not keep a job, AND they get pregnant while they are being supported by someone else?  WTF?? Guess who will be supporting the baby..", "NTA\nThe only way people like them will ever take responsibility for themselves is if they have absolutely to. Whilst your kindness is admirable, it does not help them in the long run and it certainly does nothing for you and your husband. Stick to your guns. I don\u2019t know where you live but I presume a pregnant teenager will get some help.", "Nta.\n\nI'm  not sure what the rental agreement is that you and your husband have for your apartment, but in most cases you cannot have someone living with you that is not on the lease. Most have a limit of up to 2 weeks that a visitor can stay with you. Make sure that you check that if you think they will cause a scene when you tell them to leave. The last thing you need to have happen is having yourself evicted.", "I dont know what the laws in their particular state are, but usually its 30 days notice prior to eviction. (aannd then all of the court proceedings and layers of legal if they dont comply)", "I think legally they have to because of tenant rights.", "As a non-american this is beyond crazy to me. I have stayed with friends for weeks (and actually with relatives in the US for several month) and the idea that I could claim now that I live there is just wow.", "Yeah. I'm sure they've been there long enough. Plus, once you start getting mail and telling places that you live there, that complicates things, since it's \"proof\" that's your home. Luckily, my crappy roommate who turned out to b a crappier friend willingly moved out without us saying anything chasing after some girl and drugs. But it definitely wasn't easy when he thought after that didn't pan out he'd come back. Had his mom messaging me talking about that's his address. No ma'am. I'll tell parole he ain't welcome here. He can't set a foot back through these doors. We're returning mail. Ain't finna get me again. IDC what he tells them ppl, just know I'm not.", "Exactly I say this all the time. It's crazy that people who contribute to nothing in a household have rights just because people were kind enough to let them couch surf.", "Honestly, even letting someone stay with you for a month can qualify. I let a deadbeat boyfriend move in with me once for a very short amount of time, and when I had to call the cops on him due to his drunken abuse they pretty much told me I could file a PFA, but could not kick him out legally.", "Yeah. It's crazy. Even tho someone didn't contribute to the upkeep and financial maintenance of your home or apartment, caused strife, stole things, mistreated you etc, they stayed there and got mail there, bam they live there. Our government is crazy cuz I've yet to hear a story where it helped someone who was a good person instead of a squatter or someone taking advantage of another person.", "Lol, yet the get a 'real id' drivers  licence my state, I had SO many problems. \n\nBecause although I have been living with my fiancee for over a year, get mail to the address, our address and both of our names are shown on the checks of our joint bank account, and he was there vouching for me... \n...since none of the bills are in my name and I'm not listed on the mortgage, the state considers me not to have permanent residency there.", "Maybe I'm just too cynical but from the government's standpoint, the choice is between:\n\nA) a problematic person, housed in your home (a.k.a. \"your problem\")\n\nB) the same person, potentially living on the street and messing up their statistics (a.k.a. \"their duty/problem\"). Not to speak of the public perception \ud83d\ude31\n\nSo yeah, what to say, just another mind-boggling uphill battle", "C that's crazy. Just makes zero sense.", "NTA of course.\n\nBut c'mon. You talk all about what a delinquent teenager he was, they got kicked out of their last place and neither had jobs.

Lying, stealing leeches.", "NTA - helping others shouldn\u2019t come at a cost to you.  Your brother and his gf need to get their shit together and staying with you is enabling them to continue being irresponsible.", "Becoming pregnant while living on the charity of others merely shows their lack of character and common sense. \n\nThey will Always find someone to leech off of. No need to volunteer for the job of host. \n\nNTA", "NTA you should have given them notice once they decided to have a child at your expense.
