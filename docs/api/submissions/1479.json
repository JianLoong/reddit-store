Unless she had someone(s) living there that invited your father and others without her knowledge or permission, she planned this, and never planned on telling you.

In this case, throwing a frigging party and cleary not actually caring for the little one is a line too far and too dark to cross ever again.

Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "NTA. You totally did not overreact. I would\u2019ve done the same.", "Absolutely not the AH, your child your rules!! If people don't respect that, they don't respect you!", "NTA. She violated your boundaries and can't even admit it.", "This 100x", "NTA. Your grandmother was irresponsible with your child. \n\nYour poor toddler was hungry, thirsty and at a party at 10pm, not in bed. Sitting on a strange man's lap?????? Unforgivable neglect.\n\nPlease do not second guess yourself. You were betrayed by someone you thought you could trust with your little girl. You have every right to be enraged.", "NTA, you are a great parent. Your grandma, not so much of a great grandma. Go LC with everyone. It's your child and you are within your right to set up rules for your child's well being that they managed to break. The fact that your kid didn't eat and dehydrated at 10 pm really pissed me off :(", "NTA you have an inalienable right to protect your child(ren). You know what's best and I'd be super pissed to have found my two yr old clearly thirsty and hungry that much, that late. \n\nYou're not crazy or wrong.", "You moat definitely are NTA, youbdidnthe right thing, and it sounds like that entire side of the family can not be trusted to keep your child safe, so have no place in her life right now.", "NTA\n\n\nYou should cut your loses with her too", "NTA.  Absolute 100% not.\n\nYou set clear boundaries.  Your grandmother completely trampled all over them.\n\nI would go no contact with her, too.  Or at the very least, NEVER let her be alone with your kid ever again.  Your single job as a parent is to do everything in your power to protect that kid.", "No so NTA!!!!\nI would have done the same, just the lack of respect she has shown you also shows she can not be trusted in the future.\nIf she arranged this sleep over with you she full well would have known about visitors etc and ran that past you first the fact she hadn't she knew what she was doing!", "Abuse is, as is clear in this case, often generational. That's why the rest of the family is closing ranks against you-- they're all dysfunctional enablers.   \n\n\nYou did the right thing. NTA. Don't give her the opportunity to let her do this to you and your child again. Hold those boundaries firm.", "Agreed! NTA, OP. You did the right thing.", "NTA - holy crap she was sitting on some strangers lap and you just picked her up and left - you handled that remarkably well if it had been me and my child I would probably have it the guy (not condoning violence I just know me well enough to know that would be my knee-jerk reaction)", "NTA.  Someone wanted to show off her great-granddaughter and didn't give a damn about the wellbeing of the child or basic boundaries. \n\nKid in the lap of a stranger? Kid hungry and dehydrated? Kid won't see great-grandmother any time soon.", "Unplanned my ass.  She intentionally did this because she - just like your father - has no respect for you as an adult, much less a parent. \n\nNTA\n\nAnd if I were you, she\u2019d never see my kid or me again.  \n\nI\u2019m sorry this is happening.", "NTA especially since she was sitting in the lap of some man you didn\u2019t know. \nYour grandmother put your child in a dangerous  situation and didn\u2019t feed her. Good on you for immediately taking steps to keep your child safe", "NTA and now you know to never leave your child with your grandmother.  Or anyone on that side of your extended family.", "NTA - Do not let these people gaslight you! WTH! They are out of control.", "NTA absolutely no more sleepovers with grandma, I wouldn't let her be alone with my kid after breaking boundaries like this", "NTA but time to end contact with that side of the family.", "NTA. Time to cut out that part of the family from your life.", "NTA\n\nNo way, no how you could be.  Protect your child. BTW,  LOVE the \"chalk\" ref!  On point!  Gonna steal this line!", "NTA", "NTA - no more unsupervised visit with grandma. Sorry.", "NTA. This was well planned in advance and she was hoping you would never find out. You did the right thing removing your child from that situation. Id go nc with the entire family and block the lot of them who are blowing up your phone. YOU are the parent, YOU get to decide who is around your child and since your granny decided to pull a fast one on your boundaries they can all pound sand", "NTA. And Grandma should not have any more contact with your daughter until she can show she can be trusted. Very first time she has your daughter she stomps all over your boundaries as a parent by exposing her to your father who you don\u2019t want around her. Block Grandma and her flying monkeys", "[removed]", "other family calling them a\u2026\u2026..   so look for reality check that they are sensible not falling for crazy.

Time to cut off your grandmother too unfortunately because she was part of it all.", "NTA", "NTA. She did this on the FIRST sleepover. It only gets worse from here. Your family is attempting to invalidate your stance in order to set the tone for the relationship. They want to do what they want to do with no boundaries. I am sorry that you\u2019re in this position, but I can tell that you\u2019re instinct is to protect your baby first. You\u2019re a good parent, and anybody who is capable of loving and putting their children first will recognize that. Don\u2019t take parenting advice from people who obviously don\u2019t prioritize your child\u2019s basic needs. You don\u2019t owe them anything, OP.", "NTA after this your dad's side of the family who were involved should be on supervised visitation only.", "Definitely NTA for picking her up, I hope you are going no contact with all family involved in this.\n\nPart of me does wonder why you agreed to a sleepover at greatgrandma\u2019s, it can\u2019t be a huge surprise that she is neglectful.  Not feeding a child is abuse, you left your daughter in a situation that was very unsafe.  For that your are the AH. Be more careful and don\u2019t trust anyone unless you are 100% sure they will be safe and cared for.", "NTA. There would be no more visits, ever. Grandma trampled all over her boundaries and did not respect her wishes. And, didn\u2019t care for her properly. She picked up a hungry, thirsty and tired toddler. \n\nHer father answering the phone was a huge slap in the face. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twic, shame on me.  There would be no second chance.", "I can't get the shit eating grin out of my mind. It was like saying \"look you couldn't stop me from being around her\"", "NTA. I am so very sorry, OP. Is it possible to go no contact with everyone from that side?"]}
