Carol regularly started fights with the five of us whenever Beth and her husband came to visit for dinners and such.

This resulted in Beth and I banding together and more or less ousting Carol. \n\nWe just recently had a baby shower that the baby attended because she came a bit early and most of the (15 ish) guests were allowed to hold her. Carol was not. Later, after everyone had gone home and the seven of us were back at my mom\u2019s house my stepdad pulled Beth and her husband aside in front of everyone and without leaving the room, and lobbied for them to let Carol hold the baby, despite them putting this boundary in place before we even knew the baby\u2019s gender. \n\nNaturally Beth and her husband were unwavering in their decision and i supported them. After they left, I got chastised for not trying to get Beth and her husband to change their stance. I told my mother that it\u2019s their baby and they have full control over who gets to hold and see her. Beth and I have also discussed that our mother and stepdad can lose baby privileges if they keep acting up. After I left the conversation my mom and stepdad continue to talk shit about Beth\u2019s decision. I\u2019m just trying to figure out if we are being cruel or if they just can\u2019t respect boundaries.\n\nEdit: I want to add that I have told my mom multiple times that i don\u2019t make these decisions and that it\u2019s up to the parents how they raise their kid and that if at any point I see something wrong with that I will let them know because Beth and I have a relationship where we can let each other know what\u2019s up with no filter because we trust each other to try and help one another instead of tear them down.\n\nEdit 2: I let Beth know what our parents said as they were saying it because my mom prides herself on never talking behind someone\u2019s back but actually does so regularly and I don\u2019t fw that.", "created_utc": 1670253171, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zd9fa7/aita_for_agreeing_with_my_sister_that_our/", "score": 701, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
