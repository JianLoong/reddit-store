Carol regularly started fights with the five of us whenever Beth and her husband came to visit for dinners and such. I, who has only recently gotten my first job and don\u2019t have a license or a car, have been stuck at home dealing with the abuse my whole life while my mother was working all day (to no fault of her own) and have been forced to not defend/stand up for myself as my mom and stepdad see it as instigating. This resulted in Beth and I banding together and more or less ousting Carol. \n\nWe just recently had a baby shower that the baby attended because she came a bit early and most of the (15 ish) guests were allowed to hold her. Carol was not. Later, after everyone had gone home and the seven of us were back at my mom\u2019s house my stepdad pulled Beth and her husband aside in front of everyone and without leaving the room, and lobbied for them to let Carol hold the baby, despite them putting this boundary in place before we even knew the babies gender. \n\nNaturally Beth and her husband were unwavering in their decision and i supported them. After they left, I got chastised for not trying to get Beth and her husband to change their stance. I told my mother that it\u2019s their baby and they have full control over who gets to hold and see her. Beth and I have also discussed that our mother and stepdad can lose baby privileges if they keep acting up. After I left the conversation my mom and stepdad continue to talk shit about Beth\u2019s decision. I\u2019m just trying to figure out if we are being cruel or if they just can\u2019t respect boundaries.\n\nEdit: I want to add that I have told my mom multiple times that i don\u2019t make these decisions and that it\u2019s up to the parents how they raise their kid and that if at any point I see something wrong with that I will let them know because Beth and I have a relationship where we can let each other know what\u2019s up with no filter because we trust each other to try and help one another instead of tear them down.", "created_utc": 1670253171, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zd9fa7/aita_for_agreeing_with_my_sister_that_our/", "score": 32, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like Carol just needs to be put NC by your sister/BIL and maybe your parents too because they are a large part of this problem.  If they think it's such a great idea to let an abusive person hold a baby, then maybe they need a sharp reality check.  I really hope your sister never lets them babysit or that child will be in Carol's hands so fast the air will burn.", "NTA.\n\nYou have it correct.  The parents get to decide who they're comfortable with holding their newborn.  It's pretty simple.  Your mom and stepdad need to back off with the attempts at boundary stomping.", "NTA. Great job sticking up for your sister and her perfectly reasonable boundaries!

That's just setting the baby up for further trauma as well as exasperating the parental trauma of seeing their precious child being held.by someone they don't trust and is viewed as a threat. Abuse is abuse. Also it's not spiteful for a parent to set boundaries and choose not to allow toxicity. That's not spiteful that's  what responsible caring and protective parents are supposed to do.
