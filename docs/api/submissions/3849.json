Right before the ceremony he had her on his lap and was whispering but I could hear it. He was saying he wished she would open her birthday presents and she was like I just don't want to do it today. then he said what if she opens them and he buys new ones for the day they celebrate. Then my grandma came over and tried to give her a gift and he was just so annoying about it.\n\nFinal straw was during the reception. Marissa was complaining to my grandma how she hates chocolate cake (only cake we had) and my dad took her in his arms and was asking if she wanted to go out later and get something, and again apologized.\n\nI finally snapped and yelled at him if my wedding was such a burden take the child he is dating and get the fuck out (I meant because of her actions, there isn't a big age gap) He looked horrified and I was like well go.

Yet he was there, he never asked you to pick a different date, he paid, he walked you down the isle...but it wasn't enough?  You were no better than him splitting his attention by having such a public outburst when you should have been focused on other things.  \n\nIf you love your dad and want him in your life, your possible future children's lives - you should check your attitude about his fiance and sit down and talk to him.  Doesn't seem like she is going away and you aren't doing yourself any favors in not at the very least ensuring your relationship with him is solid.

You also said that your dad says Marissa has had a lot of trauma, I\u2019m assuming you don\u2019t know what that trauma is, so for all we know her trauma could be linked to her birthday which is why he kept making sure she\u2019s alright and apologizing. Now the reason I\u2019m not making a judgment is because of how you reacted. That was a major reaction to what I feel like isn\u2019t a big deal bc all he was trying to do was make sure that she was good. Your reaction leads me to believe that there\u2019s something deeper going on, maybe some resentment towards your father and Marissa\u2019s relationship? And if you\u2019ve been mistreated or felt abandoned in some way by your father bc of his relationship with her then I\u2019d say your reaction was justified in a sense.", "You should not have yelled at your dad like that. You should have taken him aside to address your concerns.\n\nMarissa should stop playing the victim and been happy that she was invited to your special day since you don\u2019t have a good relationship with her. I get it was her birthday, but she\u2019s an adult and could have waited till later to have a full celebration.\n\nYour grandma needs stay out of it.\n\nAnd lastly, you father should not be treating his fianc\u00e9e like a baby and coddling her.

Lots of people celebrate their birthday on the closest weekend just out of convenience, so moving it for an important event is rational. You can celebrate it any time that's convenient, and it would be logical and normal to move your party to another day to accommodate someone's wedding (which they theoretically only get one of).

Marissa doesn't seem to have done anything wrong (other than not telling dad to shut up). Yeah, sitting on his lap was weird (but some people do that, and I've had exs before pull me onto their lap, what am i going to do fight it and make a scene?)

He'd also likely know she pushed herself to come to the wedding to support him as father of the bride. I could see him appreciating her being there, while also feeling guilty that she may have felt she didn't really have a choice. His guilt makes him constantly apologize, which in a way let's her know he's not downplaying her trauma. In that case, it was never meant as a slight against you, because it didn't actually have anything to do with you.

I just pray I see my daughter when she is old enough to come find me", "I'm in the same boat. Someone important to me died right before my birthday, and the way it happened caused me a lot of trauma that I'm still working through. \n\nMy daughter wants to celebrate my birthday on my birthday. She's a kid, it's important to her, and she lost someone special to her too. Luckily she was not with me when I found and tried to revive him. For her, she gets to celebrate two people she loves on my birthday, and I can barely stand the friggin day.\n\nSo, we celebrate. Then I cry in the shower and have an extra therapy appointment to get me through. My issue is MY issue and I make sure not to inflict it on other people.", "I would like to know also", "INFO; did you reach out to Marissa to express your apologies for your wedding (and therefore your anniversary every year for the rest of your life) being double-booked with her birthday, and to make any sort of acknowledgment or compromise for how she was feeling?", "Maybe nta, but you're certainly color blind when it comes to red flags. Her reaction is extreme to the point of looking like manipulation and you have no idea if he was apologizing out out of self defense. By going off on him you shut the door to any chance you might have had at finding out if he was in bad situation.", "How old is Marissa?", "Once you\u2019re an adult, making a big deal about a birthday that isn\u2019t a milestone, like your 30th or 40th, is kind of immature, imo. Of course you expect your partner to give you a gift and maybe you go out to dinner, but man, I\u2019d love going to a wedding on my birthday, and a family wedding would certainly take precedence. NTA.", "Marissa was a prostitute to provide for her son as a single mom and has trauma from it.", "No I don\u2019t have much of a relationship with her and don\u2019t see why I would. My anniversary isn\u2019t something I\u2019d want to celebrate with my dad anyway so there is no issue there", "Yeah, I read it like you. All these NTA and their responses are making me wonder if we read the same post?", "That\u2019s what I read too.  It sounds like Marissa was just there.  The word stoic doesn\u2019t imply Marissa was outwardly over the top emotional.  OP\u2019s Dad I get her being annoyed at him.  But I don\u2019t understand the hate toward Marissa based on OP\u2019s original post", "37", "I see that and feel that the OP's father has gotten himself into a real situation that he will eventually regret. I kinda get the feeling that Marissa is being spoiled by OP's dad as part of her manipulation.\n\nAnd some people aren't happy unless they have something they can complain about.\n\nDoesn't excuse their actions at all tho.", "Right? What kind of adult sits on anyone's lap during a wedding ceremony? She is acting like a child, and dad and grandma are enabling her.\n\nETA: OP is NTA", "The description of her Marissa's behaviour makes me think she has age regression. \n\nhttps://psychcentral.com/pro/are-you-emotionally-regressing", "It honestly sounds from what OP reveals that it\u2019s her dad that was being weird. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do this today\u201d could have just been marissa being like \u201cwe\u2019re celebrating tomorrow, let\u2019s do it then.\u201d\n\nEither way, dads an asshole. I can\u2019t decide on OP. I feel like this could have been handled without screaming and cussing, but I don\u2019t know OP\u2019s history with their dad.", ">What sort of grown ass adults, let alone the father of the bride, acts like that at a wedding?\n\nWhat sort of \"grown ass adults\" go straight to screaming and cursing without attempting a calm & rational conversation first?  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously dad & Marissa were wrong and gross. Nobody disputes that. But OP did not handle the situation well. Thus the ESH judgement.", "He coddled her because she's heavily traumatized from being abused as a child and being a sexworker to support her family.\n\nNo it's no ideal but she's not responsible for his behavior and he probably doesn't really know how to deal with it. It's hard seeing someone you love in pain, so he tried to appease her even when she didn't ask.", "I didn\u2019t say this was how to deal with it? I said there are reasons people can be upset about their birthday, it\u2019s not fair to just act like anyone who might be is a child.", "Imagine if she had a child on her birthday. Would she ruin that kids birthday too? Ffs she needs to grow up and realize we all have trauma but be an adult and get help if it's affecting you", "Honestly, it sounds like OPs father may be in an emotionally abusive relationship. This seems like a power play on girlfriend\u2019s part to see if he\u2019s more loyal to her than his own daughter.", "She has a history of prostitution to take car of her family and child sexual abuse.\n\nShe probably is mentally a child in some ways to deal with the trauma.", "Sounds like they just lied to them about why they couldn't get their own party lol\n\nI might be wrong but I was raised Catholic and never heard of that", "She definitely through a tantrum at some point.\n\nOp\u2019s dad wouldn\u2019t have been so overly concerned about her if she hadn\u2019t made it a *huge deal*.\n\nWhat sort of dad acts like he\u2019s at his daughter\u2019s wedding out of obligation, when he\u2019s *really* rather be celebrating his fianc\u00e9\u2019s birthday - and let\u2019s everyone at the wedding know that.", "My birthday always falls the week of Thanksgiving, and occasionally on Thanksgiving. I've had a birthday celebration on my actual birthday maybe 5 times in my 35 years. Because people travel, it's a holiday, etc. When I was a kid, we lived in the country, so sometimes planned birthday celebrations got snowed out. It's literally just a birthday, we all have them, and it's not a national holiday.", "I am all about my birthday. Like, I think is should be an international holiday all about my birthday. \n\nSo a wedding on my birthday? Morning celebration at home and extra day to celebrate later. Birthday doesn't end until you get the last present and finish the last celebration. \n\nSo yeah, nta.", "Mine falls on Easter every few years, but my mom did big (to a child) special bdays with friends every year until I was 16. It'd just be the weekend before or after. Now when it does, maybe cuz we're not religious easter becomes a whole long weekend, I still get at least happy bdays from everyone. I don't care about my bday now - I see it more as a day for my parents - but seeing these comments, I'm realizing it's probably more to do with the fact that I knew \"my day\" was important to my family as a kid than my personality in general. I'm sorry. I can't imagine, and I'm so lucky I can't. <3", "Same here. My birthday doesn't really get celebrated because who really has the money after buying everything needed for Thanksgiving dinner. But honestly as long as there is a chocolate cake w/ peanut butter frosting I'm happy!", "A codependent one", "And maybe that\u2019s why celebrating on the day has never been a focus of mine. My sisters birthday falls the week of thanksgiving also (and some years on it) and mine falls the week (and sometime in) a different National holiday.", "Exactly! I was laughing because my birthday is late October, but I was still getting birthday presents after Thanksgiving - because you get together with friends and family when it's convenient for all.", "And weddings also have cake! Sometimes better cake than a birthday will have because $$$.", "The adult way to handle is it to not let someone \"shit on\" your whole day, letting your own frustration build. When it **starts** becoming a problem, walk up and have an adult conversation.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLetting a problem go on for hours is immature. Allowing yourself to become increasingly frustrated without addressing the problem is counterproductive. Screaming and cursing as your first attempt to address something is unstable childishness.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*And for the last time literally nobody is defending dad & Marissa, so you can stop explaining how wrong they were* ***because we agree with you.***", "Hey same here! I don't generally like receiving flowers either, but will always excitedly accept them from my son because he just loves picking them & getting them all pretty in a vase for me lol.  \n\nHes the only reason for many celebratory things in my life :)", "Look out for snakes.", "oh no!!!! I'm so horribly sorry"]}
