I'm not sure if Marissa was upset or not. She is very very stoic so idk, but my dad kept apologizing. When they first arrived and he came to see me in the bridal room he brought her for some reason, and as they walked in I could hear him saying sorry and asking if she was ok. Right before the ceremony he had her on his lap and was whispering but I could hear it. He was saying he wished she would open her birthday presents and she was like I just don't want to do it today. then he said what if she opens them and he buys new ones for the day they celebrate. Then my grandma came over and tried to give her a gift and he was just so annoying about it.\n\nFinal straw was during the reception. Marissa was complaining to my grandma how she hates chocolate cake (only cake we had) and my dad took her in his arms and was asking if she wanted to go out later and get something, and again apologized.\n\nI finally snapped and yelled at him if my wedding was such a burden take the child he is dating and get the fuck out (I meant because of her actions, there isn't a big age gap) He looked horrified and I was like well go. My grandma immidiatley began to berate me that I am awful and he paid for the wedding. He asked if i really wanted him to go, and I told him to either shut the fuck up about her birthday or go.

Yet he was there, he never asked you to pick a different date, he paid, he walked you down the isle...but it wasn't enough?  You were no better than him splitting his attention by having such a public outburst when you should have been focused on other things.  \n\nIf you love your dad and want him in your life, your possible future children's lives - you should check your attitude about his fiance and sit down and talk to him.  Doesn't seem like she is going away and you aren't doing yourself any favors in not at the very least ensuring your relationship with him is solid.

You also said that your dad says Marissa has had a lot of trauma, I\u2019m assuming you don\u2019t know what that trauma is, so for all we know her trauma could be linked to her birthday which is why he kept making sure she\u2019s alright and apologizing. Now the reason I\u2019m not making a judgment is because of how you reacted. That was a major reaction to what I feel like isn\u2019t a big deal bc all he was trying to do was make sure that she was good. Your reaction leads me to believe that there\u2019s something deeper going on, maybe some resentment towards your father and Marissa\u2019s relationship? And if you\u2019ve been mistreated or felt abandoned in some way by your father bc of his relationship with her then I\u2019d say your reaction was justified in a sense.", "You should not have yelled at your dad like that.

Lots of people celebrate their birthday on the closest weekend just out of convenience, so moving it for an important event is rational.

It was before and after the ceremony.", "I have seen people do that. Again this was before the ceremony not during or during the reception. Also traumas aren't comparable. Op said it herself that is was so dark she didn't want to enquire further. They didn't make an exhibition out of it. They were trying to be discreet and if anything the dad was bringing it up to make sure she was OK. Like a partner should.", "How was this a guilt trip.

In fact, I hate therapy too. I yam what I yam. In fact, I declined an invite to a wedding because I knew I'd stress out and make people uncomfortable. I didn't want my *trauma* to ruin a *wedding* because I don't think my *fragility* is more important than a *bride*", "Nah, a grown woman publicly sitting on her boyfriends lap at his daughters wedding needing to be soothed and consoled about her birthday presents? Fuck that shit.", "She is an adult and her trauma is not her fault, but it is her responsibility to manage. If she can't manage her response to stimuli she needs to remove herself from a situation, that is just mental health 101.

That is *my* responsibility though, and if being at a wedding will trigger it then *I should not go to the wedding*. Simple as that. \n\nBecause I\u2019ve gotten a lot of therapy and help over the years, there aren\u2019t a lot of things that trigger it. OP could have handled this situation more delicately, but mental illness is an explanation, not an excuse. And when you hurt someone because of your mental illness or trauma, you *still* have to apologize and make it right.\n\nETA: Melissa could have celebrated her birthday the day before or a week before if birthday presents are a triggering issue. And just because sitting on her husband\u2019s lap is how she \u201ccopes\u201d doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s appropriate at all.

Adults who care about birthdays are creepy and immature.", "The first response should be a gentle reminder or a polite but stern warning. Yelling 'your SO is a child and get the fuck out' as the first engagement means YTA.  Them's the rules.\n\nAnd frankly if someone's _paying for the damn wedding_ then they get to be weird at it.

The dynamic of the dad coddling a grown woman and having on his lap is freaking weird.", "Idk, dad kept doing this around OP so it seems like he was trying to make sure OP knew the sacrifice he was making. I\u2019m normally sensitive to peoples trauma, but apparently Marissa refuses therapy and has an \u201caccept my issues or get out of my life\u201d attitude. I come from a family with a lot of mental health and trauma issues, including myself. You\u2019re responsible for your own mental health and making as minimal impact on others as possible.

Idk why fianc\u00e9 only had _some_ therapy as a child, but it\u2019s clear the trauma wasn\u2019t dealt with appropriately and I can\u2019t blame her for being emotionally immature and being terrified of unlearning how she\u2019s coped her entire life \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like fianc\u00e9 had any of those expectations tho", "And as someone who presumably had the ability to develop emotionally as a child in a healthy way, that\u2019s quite easy to say \n\nWhilst I don\u2019t agree with the refusal to continue therapy, I can understand her avoidance. She\u2019s been using her coping mechanisms for _decades_, and having to unlearn that and face her emotions head on is not attractive. Even emotionally intelligent people dislike doing that more often than not, never mind someone with a ton of trauma to process", "Honestly, I can\u2019t comprehend, but \u2018dark\u2019 trauma as a child is never a good thing.

Just because he's paying, doesn't give him the right to act the way he does. Nobody has that right. Sorry, but it was her wedding day and it's ONE day. He paid no attention to his daughter. It was all about her, not his fianc\u00e9. That was her moment with her new husband. He's the AH and so is his fianc\u00e9. Yes, she should have been a bit less abrasive and maybe threw out a warning or two. Probably shouting out GTFO wasn't her finest moment.\n\nBetween you and me, ya think it was all captured on video? Now THAT'S a moment to relive, huh? LOL!", "Yeah if anything OP should be mad at her dad for presumably taking advantage of a mentally ill woman. Or he has a savior complex and wants to take care of a broken bird.", "Except while that's the description given by OP in comments, it's not what we're seeing on this day. OP says she was quiet and sad, and that could be for literally any reason. She doesn't open her presents, she doesn't throw a fit, she's just minding her business and Dad is being a bit over the top but that doesn't mean Marissa is doing anything wrong. The worst she did was not like the cake offered. \n\nThrowing insults at Marissa seems very childish if the issue is Dad, and even so I assume she overheard him simply due to proximity (bride and father of the bride) at the event. \n\nThese don't seem like \"take me as I am or get out\" so even if that is something usually at play and OP is bringing that frustration into this incident, it only makes OP more of an AH.", "If a guest doesn't want to celebrate a wedding, don't go to the wedding.

So I didn\u2019t say it should be easy for her to continue healing I\u2019m saying it sounds like something she needs to do, and I hope she can find the strength to do it, and hopefully with the support of her fianc\u00e9.", "She needed constant soothing and to be held.

Anyone in their right mind would realise that if the date is bothering you so much, you need to remove yourself from any situation without disturbing others. Her even being there is weird when she has such huge trauma surrounding the date.  \nAnd y'all can't tell me that it isn't painfully obvious when one of the guest, especially someone like the bride's father, has another adult sitting on their lap. They are adults, but they're behaving like children.", "You're really stretching now ... a bride should not have to communicate that she wants to feel special on her wedding day and a daughter shouldn't have to communicate that she wants a special moment with her father on that day.

Easy or difficult as it may be, once you realise you have a problem, the correct thing to do is addressing it. No one said it was easy.

OP booked her wedding venue etc before she told her dad the date \n\nI mean, I think dad was slightly OTT, but his behaviour was born of concern and care for his traumatised fianc\u00e9 so I\u2019m more inclined to give him grace than someone who knows said fianc\u00e9 has \u2018dark\u2019 trauma and yet shows no compassion - and chose to have a tantrum rather than a civil conversation about it", "Yup, sure, first time here.  You're so observant.", "Probably not but this in my books was a special situation. Some communication over needs wouldn't hurt. As far as dad may think, he did his job. He paid, he showed up, he walked her down the aisle and stayed the entire time to show his support. For him that may be the special moment of the wedding.
