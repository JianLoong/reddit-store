He said she has a lot of trauma and he feels so guilty spending her birthday at my wedding. I didn't say much and figured they could work it out.\n\nWell the wedding was last weekend. I'm not sure if Marissa was upset or not. She is very very stoic so idk, but my dad kept apologizing. When they first arrived and he came to see me in the bridal room he brought her for some reason, and as they walked in I could hear him saying sorry and asking if she was ok. Right before the ceremony he had her on his lap and was whispering but I could hear it. He was saying he wished she would open her birthday presents and she was like I just don't want to do it today. then he said what if she opens them and he buys new ones for the day they celebrate. Then my grandma came over and tried to give her a gift and he was just so annoying about it.\n\nFinal straw was during the reception. Marissa was complaining to my grandma how she hates chocolate cake (only cake we had) and my dad took her in his arms and was asking if she wanted to go out later and get something, and again apologized.\n\nI finally snapped and yelled at him if my wedding was such a burden take the child he is dating and get the fuck out (I meant because of her actions, there isn't a big age gap) He looked horrified and I was like well go. My grandma immidiatley began to berate me that I am awful and he paid for the wedding. He asked if i really wanted him to go, and I told him to either shut the fuck up about her birthday or go. He stayed but was cold the rest of the night and I heard Marissa and my grandma joking about how he should rip up the check he gave me for how I spoke to him.

Yet he was there, he never asked you to pick a different date, he paid, he walked you down the isle...but it wasn't enough?  You were no better than him splitting his attention by having such a public outburst when you should have been focused on other things.  \n\nIf you love your dad and want him in your life, your possible future children's lives - you should check your attitude about his fiance and sit down and talk to him.  Doesn't seem like she is going away and you aren't doing yourself any favors in not at the very least ensuring your relationship with him is solid.

You also said that your dad says Marissa has had a lot of trauma, I\u2019m assuming you don\u2019t know what that trauma is, so for all we know her trauma could be linked to her birthday which is why he kept making sure she\u2019s alright and apologizing. Now the reason I\u2019m not making a judgment is because of how you reacted. That was a major reaction to what I feel like isn\u2019t a big deal bc all he was trying to do was make sure that she was good. Your reaction leads me to believe that there\u2019s something deeper going on, maybe some resentment towards your father and Marissa\u2019s relationship? And if you\u2019ve been mistreated or felt abandoned in some way by your father bc of his relationship with her then I\u2019d say your reaction was justified in a sense.", "You should not have yelled at your dad like that. You should have taken him aside to address your concerns.\n\nMarissa should stop playing the victim and been happy that she was invited to your special day since you don\u2019t have a good relationship with her.

It sounds like both she and you were perfectly fine with the situation and he's the only one wringing his hands over it.\n\nOnce you're over 21, there's no reason to always HAVE to celebrate your birthday on the exact day. Lots of people celebrate their birthday on the closest weekend just out of convenience, so moving it for an important event is rational. You can celebrate it any time that's convenient, and it would be logical and normal to move your party to another day to accommodate someone's wedding (which they theoretically only get one of).

As I said, I used to be her.   \nA word of advice, though; go easier on your old man. He's trying to be happy with someone who isn't happy while continuing to make everyone around him happy at the same time. He has a lot of work ahead of him, and he needs you in his corner.

There was presumably plenty of time to talk beforehand about how this was an issue.\n\nBut you also presumably wanted you enjoy your day with your father and yet it sounds like you expected him to do all the work to make that happen. You made choices without including or thinking about him but then were mad he didn\u2019t like those choices. \n\nWas his behavior inappropriate? Sounds like it. But not to point where the day was ruined unless you were hyper focused on just him.

The only thing I can think about is a private conversation with her dad about how upset it makes her", "Again, if it's that unbearable - you get up and go. Or don't come at all. She's the one who lives with that trauma, the whole world won't be accommodating to that, that's just how it is. If she doesn't want to get in therapy/it doesn't help - she avoids the traumatic things.
