We grew up as your average middle-class NZ family.\n\nI have taken part in M\u0101ori workshops at work, which led me to want to learn M\u0101ori to use in daily chats. My siblings are similar, especially my sister, who has a son that is half M\u0101ori (4yo). When she talks to him, she will throw in M\u0101ori words into her sentences, such as \"kai\" (food) - basic stuff, no full sentences.  \n\nMy mother (51) has been making concerning comments.  It started from saying that she \"can't keep up with all the name changes\" of organisations (ie. hospitals) switching to M\u0101ori. She ranted about M\u0101ori being \"shoved down her throat\" and feeling \"forced\" to learn it.  She' \"doesn't understand [M\u0101ori]\", and has \"no desire to\" because \"it's not MY language\". Sister has offered to teach her the words she uses with nephew, but mum outright refuses. \n\nYesterday sister and nephew visited my parents. Mum, completely unprovoked (from my sisters account) prefaced this by saying \"please don't get upset at me when I ask you this\", followed by asking my sister to not use any M\u0101ori in her house. \n\nMy sister used two M\u0101ori words last night. \n\nMy sister reminded Mum that nephew is half M\u0101ori, but she doubled down and said whilst it's fine to talk M\u0101ori outside her house, inside is an absolute no-no. \n\nMy sister rang me in borderline tears.  I was appalled, and validated her concerns. \n\nMum rang me shortly after the call with my sister. I answered the phone with \"kia ora\" - perhaps a bit petty of me. I asked if my sister was okay, because i hadnt heard from her (to see how mum would react).  She said \"she's doing well, why?\". I was hoping for mum to share her side of the story.  Amongst the chat about how her day was,  she mentioned she \"said something\" that made my sister \"a bit upset\" when her and nephew visited,  but would not tell me what it was, and said it \"didn't matter\" when I pressed harder. \n\nAt the end of the call I confessed being a bad liar, and I know what she said to my sister infront of my nephew,  and that I'm disgusted. I hung up.  She messaged me within seconds, saying \"you're a dick\".\n\nI then sent a long message saying how harmful this mindset could be for nephew, and to apologize to my sister and my nephew personally. I was a bit harsh and used some foul language - but I really, REALLY do not want this behavior to continue. She needs to know it's unacceptable. I can post the screenshot if you're interested. \n\nShe's meant to be traveling to see me next weekend for my birthday, but in my message i stated I want her to apologize to my sister and to my nephew first. \n\nI've since found out she's told my dad that she's hurt that I \"played mind games\" on her by saying I had not talked to my sister earlier. She also said she wanted me to \"admit\" I talked to my sister prior to the call despite me saying at the end of our call that I had, hence my reaction. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1695365905, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16p3f0i/aita_for_playing_mind_games_and_being_harsh_to/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Extremely narcissistic. NTA.", "Agreed, I don't like lying, but I knew if mum knew I had heard from my sister that she would spin it as my sister twisting things and making her out to be the bad guy.  Unfortunately, she's had a habit of deflection in the past. \n\nMy sister very calmly explained to mum why she's not going to stop speaking one of her sons languages. Thankfully she removed herself and her son before things got too heated.  \n\nThis is about him, and how he may feel when he's old enough to understand, so making sure this doesn't spillover infront of him (again) is very important!", "I\u2019m afraid that would have made me go no contact with my mum if she\u2019d done that.

She murdered two cats!", "Thank you for your judgment, I appreciate it!", "Totally! She's deflecting to the already-admitted-to part. Btw, also remember she refused to tell you what she'd done because she knew what she did was racist and you'd call her on it.", "Love this! Will have to give it a listen.", "Thank you so much for your judgement - I really appreciate it and will do my best to do better in the future.  \n\nUnfortunately,  past conflicts with my mother have resulted in her deflecting things and twisting the narrative- if she knew I had spoken to my sister she would've undoubtedly told me that my sister had it wrong, had her out of context to be the bad guy.  I the heat of the moment (as this call was within minutes from learning about the racism) I decided playing dumb was the best way to go.  Definitely wish I had just not answered the call in the heat of the moment.", "Forget that \"advanced age\" excuse, she's 51, not 81. Unless there's something medical going on she's more than capable of learning new stuff.", "Thank you for your perspective, it means a lot. In NZ Maori issues and language is very politicized- similar to the vaccine conspiracies. Since C19, a lot of the antivax crowd have also swung in the direction of anti M\u0101ori. An example is any Facebook post mentioning Aotearoa New Zealand - the comments section is full of \"where is that? I live in NEW ZEALAND\". \n\n Unfortunately,  she's recently met with her older brother who is in this mindset (who boasts about his hate of M\u0101ori people). They formed an echo chamber together,  their talk becoming so bad that both my siblings who were at the house felt the need to leave.  Mum has since told my sister that \" i did not grow up rasist, but now I think I am one\". \n\nI've tried to talk to her before about why her hatred is unjust, and how she's not being forced to learn anything if she doesn't want to. \n\nIt's hard all around, but I have told her I'm happy to see her again if she's going to apologize to my sister.", "Thank you. When my sister called me, we were both in disbelief that mum could say such things.  She told me she'd called it out on the spot, but mum doubled down, and she didn't know what to do except to take nephew and leave.  \nAfter that call ended, I swear there were only minutes before mum called me.  Ideally,  I would've done as you'd said,  but I saw the opportunity to hear mum out and took it.  \n\nSister is very thankful I also said something. I can only imagine how she feels knowing what mum feels towards her sons race and culture.", "Yeah that makes sense. Dealing with emotionally manipulative parents can often require strategic talking points. I hope your nephew can receive tons of love and support from the rest of your family and that your mum can figure out a path back to being a grandmother who can love all aspects of her grandchild", "Thank you. I still find myself grieving often, I don't think I'll ever stop.  It is terrible.  \n\nBut this situation and the impact on my nephew is also appalling, fingers crossed she snaps herself out of it.", "If you are able to give it a listen, I genuinely hope you enjoy it. It's one of my favorite orchestra pieces, and that's a crowded field!", "Eh, we all make mistakes and learn from them. \n\nI grew up with an alcoholic mother (RIP a long time ago), so don't get me started on narrative twisting - processed etc, dw about that, this isn't about me, I sympathising with you!\n\nI found the best way to deal with that bullshit was actually to be 100% straight, and 100% boundaried. Unfortunately, with someone like that, there is no way to not \"play a game\" unless you go no contact. The only way to keep my own sanity **and** at least some relationship with my mother was to be 100% consistent and 100% truthful WITH BOUNDARIES - if I didn't want to discuss something, I would tell her straight. If I disagreed with her about something, I'd tell her straight, and not argue about the whys and wherefores (see 'stuck record technique'). I'm not perfect, I used to get mad and yell at her more often than I would like to remember: at least I was being honest! - and if that happened, then I'd apologise for yelling - not necessarily for being angry in the first place if that was a legitimate anger. ETC. I suppose that's a version of \"low contact\" tbh, even if you're seeing the person regularly - which is always sad to have to do, hopefully you and your sister can support each other around that to protect the children, because ngl, it's hard work. At least being true to yourself doesn't make you mad at yourself for playing mind games :)", "Youd like to think so,  eh?\n\nShe just doesn't seem open to new knowledge and hates the world becoming increasingly \"politically correct\". An example is her saying the R-word (r*****ed) quite often. I've asked her to stop so many times, as I'm autistic, one of the groups that this word is weaponised against. She continues to defend her use of this word. And says she doesn't understand why the N word is suddenly bad to say. \n\nI've tried explaining both, multiple times. I'm always happy to share reasoning and be kind,  but it seems futile sometimes. I won't give up hope that she can do and be better. Especially in this case, as she loves nephew.", "I'm 41 and I already can tell you it takes longer to remember things. Studies show our short term memory can start to act up in our 30s and come to 40s and 50s it's more noticeable for some; Especially woman. Again, there is no reason to ban the language, but keeping things hostile isn't going to help mom calm down and realize maybe learning isn't so hard. It's not she isn't capable it seems like she is getting frustrated and preventing herself from learning. Edit: Again I say, after a talk and mom keeps acting like this then OP is clearly not an AH and neither is her sis.", "Holy shit... ok double **NTA.** \n\nI'm so sorry for all of you but especially your nephew. The cognitive dissonance of people who can claim to love family but then treat people like their family (same minorities) with hatred is beyond my comprehension. I sincerely hope she can be deprogrammed from bigotry and become a more loving and kind member of your family. Wishing you lots of patience and good luck as you deal with this!", "See now this changes the picture, this clearly makes you NTA. If you would have added this tid bit it would have put you so far in the clear no questions asked. BEfore how you typed it it just sounded like old person brain. Set boundries with mom and protect your nephew because stuff like this isn't ok", "Me too. I hope this turns into a positive learning experience. Myself, my siblings, and I'm sure my nephew too would love to teach her maori words if she ever came around to it.  It's not too late for her to grow!", "If she never apologized for secretly having the cats put down, I seriously doubt you\u2019re getting any sort of apology for the racism.", "Hopefully she will.", "The whole album is on Spotify, and I skipped straight to the last song.  As soon as it started, I got goosebumps! Absolutely incredible, thank you for sharing", "Thank you, I think this is great advice. I have been very fortunate not to have much experience with this kind of story twisting in the past, but of course this means I don't necessarily know how to deal with and respond to it appropriately. I do live about 4 hours away, while my sister and nephew live minutes away.  \n\nI have faith that this is an experience for us all to grow from. Hopefully a wake up call especially to mum.", "I'm all for teaching in a calm, understanding fashion. I've tried to do it before. For example, she uses the R word a lot.  I'm autistic. I've tried to explain many times why the word is harmful, especially to disabled people like myself. She won't have a bar of it, and still uses it frequently. She's angry the world is becoming \"too PC\" and how words (like the R slur) are suddenly not okay to use despite them being fine when she grew up.  The N word is another one where she doesn't/refuses to understand how and why it's harmful to others.", "Yeah but nah. Could have mentioned, I'm actually 51 myself (which makes the \"advanced age\" thing especially weird). The brain may not be as plastic as it used to be but it's also very far from ossified. Anyone my age who gets completely set in their ways either has something medical going on, or chooses to be like that.", "Thank you so much for this.  There have been the odd comments over the years about \"those people\", and making sure to mention my sisters (now ex) partner being M\u0101ori as if it was a bad thing... but I still could not believe this was the same parent that taught me acceptance and love.  I really still can't believe it, honestly.  I'm hoping my harshness is a wakeup call - as this could really damage my nephew and he deserves nothing but the world.", "Thanks so much for this, I did originally have this in the post but it was surpassing the character limit so I had to cut out as much as I could.  Oops. I appreciate your comment!", "Listen to the 1st and last tracks back to back. The bookend effect (hearing the same thing at the very beginning and end) is one of the best I've ever heard. Glorious!", "You have to probably accept that any good relationship with your mother is over.", "Yeah the more you speak of your mother the more clearly she's an issue and she seems insufferable.", "Wow... this really stinks and I am sorry for that.  But what is your end game?  If she apologized, stopped the comments and policing the language would that be enough?  Or would you still expect her to learn the language?  Just curious?", "Yeah word counts can be tricky. Don't ever feel sorry for protecting your nephew, he is young and one day is going to have to navigate this himself sadly. Though one can hope things take a better turn in the future so he doesn't have to. Funny thing is the people spouting \"those people\" are actually the issues. And I hope your mom grasps by thinking negatively about another race/culture/so forth that makes up her grandson she is hating her own grandchild.", "Honestly, it's been a bit rocky for years.  Almost 3 years ago she put my cat, 10 years old, down because she didn't want her around anymore.  Without telling me.  Or my brother, who lived with her, and came home mid exam season to find 2 of 4 cats dead in cages.  I don't think I've managed to get over how poorly she handled that fiasco, hence why I was so harsh. \n\nI just want the best for my nephew. If this is what it takes for her to critically think about her mindset I am okay with that.", "It's unfortunate,  as she's actually pretty normal outside of these things. Or maybe I've just been too naive in the past to notice. Regardless, I hope she can grow.", "Thank you for your comment. It would be enough for her to apologise and let m\u0101ori be spoken freely, yes. I don't expect her to learn M\u0101ori, personally. I've said it's fine not to be interested in learning a new language,  this isn't about that.  \n\nI want this action to be taken so my nephew (and siblings) doesn't have to worry about speaking m\u0101ori at mum/grandma's house.  I don't want nephew to have to ask his mum why grandma doesn't want him to say words he's grown up with around her. I feel like she's so much better than this.", "Thank you.  I just hope this will be enough for her to question her current beliefs. There's a great opportunity to grow, I hope she takes it", "As my grandmother would say \"Sht covered in gold is still sht\". We don't like to think our parents in a negative light because we love them.  And heck sometimes we don't see what is wrong because we are so used to it we never looked up seen that it isn't. And the fact she acted the way to you calling you names she's probably always been that way. Now a bigger shoe has been chucked at a fan and it's not simply mom acting towards you anymore. You've been forced to look up. Ask yourself since these things come to light and you are grasping how wrong it is, is it harder to see her as pretty normal? I am hoping she changes, because no matter the age one can change - or at least shut up.", "That\u2019s definitely reasonable. Unfortunately I don\u2019t think she will end up being reasonable. But good luck to you.", "Back when the Berlin wall was coming down I asked my grandfather what racism was. With out missing a beat he told me to go call grandma two words. Not only did I learn to fear my grandmother, but I learned how much pain racism can cause. Ask your mother, can she seriously look her grandbaby in eyes and say those things. He is not an exception because he was born into her family. If she is going to continue to think that way she is going to have to remember the hurt in her grandsons eyes being hated by his grandmother. And if she continues in her ways she cannot be his grandmother.", "It's REALLY hard growing up in a perfect family with perfect parents to slowly have that image chipped away. I've tried to forgive her before.\n\nTW: animal deaths.  \n\n\nShe put my cat, my best friend, to sleep without telling me (or my brother that lived with her at the time). During the heat of his exam period, he came home to Misty and Mini (12yo) dead in cages.  She had not told us she would do this.  I had moved away for uni.  She had kept (what i assumed) jokingly asking me to take Misty with me, to which i repeatedly told her it wasnt possible. I was given no hints that she was so desperate to rid herself of two of our childhood pets. \n\nMy brother called me, hysterically crying, to break the news.  Mums first response to all this was to post in the family group chat that she didn't want \"any haters\" getting angry at her.  Of course we were livid. My image of her completely shattered. She kept making my siblings and I feel like we shouldn't be upset, and that it wasn't a big deal.  I'm still grieving 3 years later.  \n\nI have tried so, so hard to forgive. My relationship has gotten better, but it's much easier for me to go no contact after the cat incident.  I'm just embarrassed and disgusted she'd somehow stoop even lower.", "Thank you, I'll definitely need it", "This gave me goosebumps to read.\n\n Mum's one of those folks that think you can be racist to white people - I think she really just needs to put herself in someone else's shoes. Nephew's shoes would be a great start. How would she feel if he was upset in the future by someone else being racist? Would she be able to console him with her feeling how she does about M\u0101ori? \n\nI'm hoping that one day (and one day very soon) she'll be able to change her way of thinking.  She doesn't need to learn any words, but she can certainly be accepting of them.", "Go look up the word narcissistic it sounds like your mother has a case of it. I'm sorry to hear about your kitties. I applaud you and your sis for not cutting her out completely. TBH sounds like you need to give her a choice start acting like a human or be cut out. You and your sis can be ok without your mom.", "Thank you,  it really means a lot.
