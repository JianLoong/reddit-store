We had an amicable divorce when Callum was two, and so far we\u2019ve been coparenting quite well. \n\nNow, I could say a lot of things about Amanda\u2019s parenting, but the long and short of it is that she and her new husband cater their parenting style to their two younger kids together (11f and 8m). Because of this, he\u2019s decreased his time at their house ever since he got the choice, and now spends every other weekend at their house. \n\nAround a month ago, Amanda and her husband made a \u201creading rule\u201d for the kids. The 8 year old has to read 30mins a day, the 11 year old has to read for an hour, and Callum has to read for two hours. I have no idea why they did this, I think it\u2019s because the 8 year old is falling behind in his reading level and they wanted to keep things \u201cfair\u201d between the kids. I think that this is ridiculous, as Callum is a very smart kid already, and he needs that time for homework and relaxing since he doesn\u2019t have that much freetime to begin with. \n\nAmanda let me know that she expected me to enforce the \u201creading rule\u201d when Callum is at my house. I told her that I would not. She said that it was unfair to Callum\u2019s half siblings that he could just leave for my house and not have to follow the rule, while they had to follow the rule no matter what. I told her tough luck, it\u2019s my house and I make the rules, not her. \n\n Well now, Callum is thinking about not staying with her at all anymore due to the increasing strictness of her and her husband\u2019s rules. She told me that it\u2019s all my fault that he doesn\u2019t want to be around her anymore because I was so lax with the rules. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m in the right here, but I though it might be a good idea to get some perspective, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1684512103, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13lzpoq/aita_for_refusing_to_enforce_my_exs_reading_rule/", "score": 8700, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Neither is having rules forced on him for no legitimate reason ...  Life sucks, it's never fair. She can deal.\n\n\nTotally NTA", "NTA \n\nif she thinks that it\u2019s so unfair, she can get rid of the rule herself.

I'm guessing he's a sophomore in high school, and has homework and other stuff that goes along with a high school boy, how is he reasonably supposed to do this?  I'd say that the time he spends on his homework should count towards that time.  Granted, that won't help over the summer though.\n\nI'd encourage him to keep going, but his mom needs to back off on that rule.  Especially if he's reading at/above grade level.  He should probably talk to her about it (with you present) so that she can hear what his concerns are directly from him.", "NTA- What that hell?? 2 hours of reading? That's insane! Just because one child is falling behind doesn't mean you punish the other ones what kind of ridiculous logic is that. The only one if you son decided to move in with you full time is herself", "NTA!

There's probably way more factors that led your son to consider not seeing her as often anymore.", "NTA what does she think he's doing at school all day and while doing his homework? \n\nFairness isn't bringing everyone down or holding everyone back to the lowest performers level. Blanket restrictions for the sake of one child are lazy and favoritism. \n\nHer rule is completely arbitrary. She's not teaching her kids anything useful except to resent their younger sibling for being the reason they have extra rules. Good parenting would be explaining to the kid struggling with reading that everyone has different talents and has different areas where they have to work harder. *She* should be the one taking on extra reading time alongside the struggling child and helping them cope with their struggle. She should be encouraging the older siblings to read with him, but not punishing them in hopes it makes one child feel better.", "How are you being lax with the rules?

At this point, while recreational reading is great- he may legitimately may be better served getting out of the books and screens and into some physical activity.\n\nIf I were in your shoes I would tell your ex that while I understand that she needs to keep things fair and balanced at her place, your focus is solely on your son and his best interests. And at 15, your son is old enough to understand different rules apply at different homes.", "NTA. 2 hours is a lot if you\u2019re forced to do it on top of everything else.

Why is your son getting punished (note: I do not think reading is a punishment, rather the requirement imposition of an arbitrary time) because his half sibling is falling behind?  That makes absolutely no sense at all. Additionally, would she enforce a rule you made in her home?  I doubt that.", "NTA. That's a ridiculous rule to begin with, even for an 8 y.o., much less for a 15 y.o. What would forcing a kid to read accomplish except make them resentful of reading? It's supposed to be a leisure activity, one people enjoy, not the one they are forced into.", "NTA. As a 15yo, I\u2019m guessing he already has a ton of homework. Two hours a day seems excessive!

Good for you for sticking up for your son and putting his well being first OP.", "NTA - this is in no way to the kid's benefit and she has no leg to stand on. \n\nAs a side note, even for the younger kids that sounds mostly like a really great way to make them hate reading.", "If she wants him to continue to be a reader once he\u2019s done with school, this isn\u2019t the way to do it. That kid will never willingly pick up a book again if he\u2019s forced to read outside of homework for 2 HOURS A DAY. Yikes. NTA", "NTA- I was going to say you were but naw. F that.

Before anyone comes at me!)", "NTA it's your house and your rules. If someone doesn't want to be at your place because of how you treat them or make them feel that's on you.

When I was younger if I was in trouble my punishment was to just sit quietly and I was only allowed to read during those times, now as an adult, I can barely make it through the first chapter of a book and that's even WHEN I feel like I want to really read it, if they insist on making callums longer just because he's older, he may not be able to enjoy reading in the future.\n\nIf he has already on his own decided to cut back the first time of how often and how long he is there, then he has every right to not be made to return back to that house and if the step mom has a problem with it then tell them \"well he'd want to be there more if your rules weren't so strict\" (idk why the reading thing was implemented but it sounds like they are basically punishing him for the younger ones error, and that will definitely not help at all in the future.)", "NTA. \n\nDoes she also have a 7pm bedtime for your 15 yr old since that is when 8yo goes to bed? \nThat is how ridiculous she sounds.", "Teacher here, forcing kids to read is counter intuitive.

Most grown up book nerds can\u2019t even find two hours a day to read.\n\nYour ex is unintentionally turning a healthy practice into something oppressive with your son. Regular supervised reading with a parent can help a struggling child improve their reading comprehension. It sounds like your wife\u2019s youngest child needs that. An hour of free reading a day isn\u2019t a bad idea for an eleven year old either as that is an age when they are expanding their vocabulary and discovering new interests. However, requiring two hours of reading a day from a fifteen year old, if they don\u2019t need the practice, is detrimental. \n\nReading should be a joy not an obligation. As long as you are making sure your son has access to good books he likes reading, he doesn\u2019t need set reading requirements.", "NTA.\n\nRemember the main character in these posts is always the kid.

As a nerdy 15 year old I probably did spend two hours a day reading. By choice, because I enjoyed it.

Forcing a 15 year old to read for two hours while the 8 year old is only reading for half an hour is ridiculous, especially since your son only spends some weekends with his mom so his time with her is limited to begin with. It basically makes it out as him being punished due to younger siblings.  Forcing a kid to read like that is one eay to kill their desire to read at all.\n\nMy parents had some different rules for my siblings and I that depended on our ages and needs.  It's normal.  \n\nI have to wonder what other ridiculous rules they try and enforce on at 15 year old in order to cater to the younger half siblings", "NTA\n\nReading is a great skill to encourage. 2 hours a day is crazy. I love reading, did in high-school too. Even with it as my second favourite pass time, I cannot find 2 hours everyday to read. Beyond that forcing someone to read like that is not going to encourage a love or even a like for reading. It will likely ruin reading for them.\n\nOur plan for our kids - they aren't old enough yet - will be that at bed time you can go to sleep or read quietly in bed. No tablets, phones or TV. This will give them an opportunity to develope an interest without forcing it. This is beside the point though, objecting to an enforced 2hr/day reading schedule is not only your right as a parent but also just healthier for your child. \n\nIf you are willing to compromise, talk to your son to see if he is OK with 30 mins of reading each night, maybe before bed. However, you don't need to compromise.

I mean how much text will a 15y old go through in 2h and a 8y old in 30min. Read more pages or complicated the older but longer as in more time?? Not to mention the 8y seemingly needs it but why forcing a teen with perfectly fine reading skill to read to hours a day? No no no none of this makes any sense", "NTA.

HOWEVER, only if the child is willing. Forcing a child to read will cause skills to develop slowly and tend not to stick as much.  On top of that, it will only create resentment & cause the child to push away from that activity.

It had \"darker\" themes, and more magic and fantasy concepts. My daughter began to express interest in stories with magic and action/adventure. Last week my mom came over with a stack of 3rd grade level chapter books that all had a princess/fairy/adventure theme, and just enough pictures every few pages to keep a kid interested. And now my daughter has stayed up for an hour past bedtime every day getting through 50/60 pages a night in these little books.

I did Summer programs at the library and won so many prizes for reading the most books. But the moment I hit high school and had required reading for the summer. Those 3 books took forever to read.

Even for school nights, those hours are too early for a teen.\n\nA curfew that early means he can't even go to the early show at the movies.\n\nI'm of the opinion that curfews should be situational.  Things like \"Oh you're going to hang out at a friend's house, well be back by 10, because we're going to the amusement park tomorrow and need to wake up early.\"  Or \"The movie you are going to gets out at 11:30, so be back by midnight.\n\nToo early of a curfew can seriously harm a teens social life.

And something that hasn't been mentioned at all, how does he get along with his stepdad?\n\nIf you don't know the answer to these, I would also ask your son about where he sleeps when he is at her house, what is the food situation like (is he expected to eat no more than his much smaller siblings), does his mom ever buy him gifts, or clothing, is there activities for him to do at their house.\n\nI would talk to your son about him not going for weekends anymore, then talk to your ex about how he doesn't want to spend weekends over anymore.
