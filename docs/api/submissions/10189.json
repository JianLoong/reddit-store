I teach courses on clothing construction and design, and serve as a the advisor to design students.  We are lucky enough to have a unionized theater on our campus and get paid industry actors in to do our shows and then students in the program work within those shows (either as actors or behind the scenes) as a training program to go into the industry.  I serve as the costume designer for these shows so I am training costume majors as well as training student actors on proper costume/dressing room procedures and etiquette.\n\nIn theater unionized actors have their undergarments provided by the theater, non union actors do not.  We are currently doing a show that takes place in the 1950s and our stage crew has a small role as a gaggle of older women in the first act.  All stage crew were fitted with costumes (a t length dress, sweater, wig and hat) and I asked each students if they had shoes that would work.  If they didn\u2019t have shoes I could pull shoes from our closet for them.  But I did ask each student to get a pair of skin toned nylons or tights since women in that period wouldn\u2019t have bare legs.  Fittings were about 5 days before the first dress rehearsal.\n\nAt our first dress rehearsal (we only have two dress rehearsals before we open to the public) one student came out with black tights.  She had a cream colored shoe and purple dress so it just looked really distracting.  Before last nights dress rehearsal asked the student to please not wear the black tights again as we were taking pictures.  The student said they couldn\u2019t find anything in their skin tone so I said to just go without tights then because the black was very distracting from the overall picture.  The student pushed back a bit and I said again I would prefer no tights to the black tights because it looked very out of place.  That\u2019s my job is to make sure everyone on stage is dressed appropriately and in line with the story/time period.\n\nWell I guess I upset the student who didn\u2019t feel comfortable with bare legs.  They complained to the stage manager who came to have a \u201ctalk\u201d with me and then involved our boss, the show producer (the producer is one of the equity actors in the show so he can\u2019t see what the whole picture looks like).  I pushed back stating that the black tights looked very distracting.  I also feel like part of my job is training actors that if they are asked to get a supply, it is up to them to follow through.  You can\u2019t go on stage at a professional theater in something the wardrobe crew did not approve, if you enter the actors equity union you would be fined for doing so.  I had one back up pair of nylons for our lead female equity actress and the stage manager took those and gave them to the student.\n\nSo am I the AH for making the student uncomfortable by ask them to wear no tights? (For anyone wondering a t length dress is about midway between the knee and the ankle, so the student had about 6 inches of leg showing)", "created_utc": 1676638375, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/114jmcc/aita_for_telling_a_student_to_not_wear_black/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe you weren't clear enough about \"tights\" either since most people consider tights different from nylons, which tend to be dressier and more sheer than tights, and what you seem to be looking for.

Maybe next time do some scouting in your area to find stores that have what you are requiring so you can offer some examples and an idea of where to find them.", "I am leaning YTA. The student couldn't find tights that matched her skin tone so she opted for black.

Finding black clothing has absolutely nothing to do with skin color and is accessible to everyone. It\u2019s unrealistic to ask a student of color to find tights in their skin tone within 5 days.

Even if there were several stores in walking distance, it\u2019s clear that when the student told you that they were unable to find the right color for their skin tone, they had probably already vetted the stores you are referring to, which probably has a large demographic of white customers and does not serve BIPOC students in the same way. A little empathy and understanding goes a long way. It\u2019s clear from you\u2019re defensiveness you are looking for confirmation bias.

Who knows.\n\nBut I do know I have a tooon of black clothing and would have zero problems putting together suck an outfit, I doubt many college aged students would. Even if they didn\u2019t have it, finding such clothing would be far easier than flesh toned tights for POC. Not the same at all.", "Makes so much sense now.

Also, students don't always know what exactly is meant by 'nylons' or 'dance tights'. \n\nEvery campus theatre works dfferently, and at my campus theatre, we could just provide something like this is the student didn't have it. Espedially if the student is a POC (or a bigger person) and can't easily find what we're asking for without special-ordering it. \n\nRegardless, you could at least have emailed the student some links to products that would would be suitable once you noticed there was a problem. That would not have been too hard.\nThey're students. Sometimes they need extra teaching and additional information.\n\nEven an email with some links is 100% better than just asking them to go without a costume item that everyone else has, because you couldn't be bothered to solve an issue that is slightly more complicated for POC than white people, or to teach her about different leg coverings.\n\nYTA, I'm afraid.", "She had 5 days to get some. One spare pair for the lead isn't the same as \"some for Caucasian skin\". I just looked at Walmart and they have oodles of different color hose as well. Unless there is no Walmart nearby (doubtful) stop making excuses for an adult. \"But what if she's on a boat in the middle of the ocean where there are no stores at all, clearly biased\"", "I want to clarify the only reason I had the lighter skinned pair was as a backup for the lead of the show, who is an equity position actress and Caucasian.  It is in the contract that we provide undergarments to them (AEA) I provided her two pairs that get washed and then had one back up in the shop in case of a tear.  So that\u2019s what I ended up giving to the student in question.  I offered them up but said they didn\u2019t have to since they were the wrong color.  But if there were no equity actors in the show, I wouldn\u2019t have undergarments on hand at all (except for mens undershirts/socks with we are able to wash and reuse).", "Your comment would be helpful if the student actually wanted to follow directions but did not have the tools available to do so.\n\n(Although I do think you are infantilizing the student.  She is not a pre-teen.  She is in college.  If she cannot follow the professor\u2019s directions, it should be her responsibility to raise that issue with the professor and ask for alternatives and suggestions.  It should not be on the professor to magically intuit what the problem is.)\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think that there was a legitimate problem.  When the student was told to just wear no hosiery as an acceptable compromise, which would require literally no work and no purchases on her part, the girl flat out refused!\n\nFrom that, I conclude availability and resources were not the actual problem, but the girl\u2019s attitude.

I guarantee you that if there is a Walmart anywhere close, there will not be diverse colors of tights in stock.  Have you ever been in a show?  5 days during tech week, and while in school is not much time.  If you are a college costume designer, having common consumable undergarments on hand and a way to accommodate all your students is a better solution.", "Also,if this student isn't white, there isn't a need to 'magically intuit' where there might be a problem here. It's........fairly obvious?", "Yes, the student should have raised any concerns she had earlier. You're not wrong about that. But there are also a number of reasons why somebody in the student's position might not. It takes veru little effort on the costumer's part to work with the student to find some proper tights.\n\nAnd do you really not see that it's damaging to ask a person of colour to just go without something that all the other actors have because the costumer doesn't feel like dealing with the situation anymore? Just send her some links. It takes ten minutes tojput an email like that together.  The rest is on her. If she won't take it from there, then yes, it's a her problem.", "Just checked the Walmart in North Dakota and in Nebraska, both had multiple skin tone tights. I will agree she should have some on hand though. I bet she will in the future."]}
