I teach courses on clothing construction and design, and serve as a the advisor to design students.  We are lucky enough to have a unionized theater on our campus and get paid industry actors in to do our shows and then students in the program work within those shows (either as actors or behind the scenes) as a training program to go into the industry.  I serve as the costume designer for these shows so I am training costume majors as well as training student actors on proper costume/dressing room procedures and etiquette.\n\nIn theater unionized actors have their undergarments provided by the theater, non union actors do not.  We are currently doing a show that takes place in the 1950s and our stage crew has a small role as a gaggle of older women in the first act.  All stage crew were fitted with costumes (a t length dress, sweater, wig and hat) and I asked each students if they had shoes that would work.  If they didn\u2019t have shoes I could pull shoes from our closet for them.  But I did ask each student to get a pair of skin toned nylons or tights since women in that period wouldn\u2019t have bare legs.  Fittings were about 5 days before the first dress rehearsal.\n\nAt our first dress rehearsal (we only have two dress rehearsals before we open to the public) one student came out with black tights.  She had a cream colored shoe and purple dress so it just looked really distracting.  Before last nights dress rehearsal asked the student to please not wear the black tights again as we were taking pictures.  The student said they couldn\u2019t find anything in their skin tone so I said to just go without tights then because the black was very distracting from the overall picture.  The student pushed back a bit and I said again I would prefer no tights to the black tights because it looked very out of place.  That\u2019s my job is to make sure everyone on stage is dressed appropriately and in line with the story/time period.\n\nWell I guess I upset the student who didn\u2019t feel comfortable with bare legs.  They complained to the stage manager who came to have a \u201ctalk\u201d with me and then involved our boss, the show producer (the producer is one of the equity actors in the show so he can\u2019t see what the whole picture looks like).  I pushed back stating that the black tights looked very distracting.  I also feel like part of my job is training actors that if they are asked to get a supply, it is up to them to follow through.  You can\u2019t go on stage at a professional theater in something the wardrobe crew did not approve, if you enter the actors equity union you would be fined for doing so.  I had one back up pair of nylons for our lead female equity actress and the stage manager took those and gave them to the student.\n\nSo am I the AH for making the student uncomfortable by ask them to wear no tights?

Sometimes they need extra teaching and additional information.\n\nEven an email with some links is 100% better than just asking them to go without a costume item that everyone else has, because you couldn't be bothered to solve an issue that is slightly more complicated for POC than white people, or to teach her about different leg coverings.\n\nYTA, I'm afraid.", "She had 5 days to get some.

It is in the contract that we provide undergarments to them (AEA) I provided her two pairs that get washed and then had one back up in the shop in case of a tear.

She is not a pre-teen.  She is in college.

It should not be on the professor to magically intuit what the problem is.)\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think that there was a legitimate problem.  When the student was told to just wear no hosiery as an acceptable compromise, which would require literally no work and no purchases on her part, the girl flat out refused!\n\nFrom that, I conclude availability and resources were not the actual problem, but the girl\u2019s attitude.

And this is why the equity coordinator became involved? But you are trying to leave these very important facts out of your account?", "You are absolutely correct in terms of stage picture and design.  However, student actors are kind of sensitive and don\u2019t always know proper protocol.  The student should have asked for help in advance if they couldn\u2019t get the item, but there\u2019s a way to talk/negotiate with actors (especially in an educational setting) when they are being difficult and to problem solve in the minute (like offering a substitute from stock).  I think it\u2019s difficult when there are different levels of professionalism on a show, especially when students are there to learn/in a \u201csafe space\u201d.  As you say, you are there to train them and some have a bigger learning gap (although I get the stress of getting the show open).  So I think it really depends on your tone and how you handled the conversation.\n\n**not in costume design, but scenic and sometimes props and have assisted wardrobe/costume designers.  Coming from a film background I find the asks for actors in theater to be kind of shocking, since in my other industry they are VERY taken care of.", "I get that this is not the intended takeaway, but I am pretty sure it's tea-length (as in, appropriate to wear to a tea party).

Unfortunately it's just true that darker skinned women often don't have a real \"nude\" option available and maybe the black was the closest thing she could find. I can also see why she would feel weird about being the only one with bare legs.", "If she is a person of color, it is pretty difficult to find hose in your actual skin tone. For all the Amazon shoppers out there, if you have brown skin or deep toned skin, those colors are very hit or Miss. \n\nThey can look anything from ashy to just plain wrong. Also they cost more. Any non POC can walk into Wal-mart and get nude or suntan or moon colored and it can work for $2.79. That is not always the option for a POC and they always have limited size ranges in the POC colors. \n\nThis is just me informing all of you that there are a lot of steps between just and buy hose when you are a POC. \n\nI had to go to five Targets one time because I found out they were discontinuing the only color I found that was an exact match for my skin. I bought out all of them.", "I\u2019m going to go with a YTA, after hearing this person is POC. It\u2019s actually quite challenging to find tights that match your skin tone. I understand that you might not have had this experience but it does happen.", "YTA\n\nLet's start with the chance of thick tights being present in the 1950's- entirely possible, especially for Black women who had limited choices. Many even went without. Your idea of 1950s fashion is only historical in context to white women because Black fashion was not as well documented, unless you're looking for it, not common knowledge. If you want to be accurate, look into that more.\n\nYou obviously used an idea for \"skin toned\" that did not include all the tones present \n\nLastly, if you are not providing, you get less say. She did show up in tights that are skin toned, for some. You did not clarify well and ignored how darker tones can be hard to find, especially in certain sizes. You wanted them to wear sheer nylons from the sound of it. You are using the wrong words because you do not seem to understand not everyone thinks of skin tone tights the same way as you.\n\nBuzz words or not, this is what people mean when they talk about \"inclusive language\". You expected your idea to mean the same to her as you when it didn't. If you adjusted your language in the first place, there would have been less confusion.", "In general, yes, actors have to wear what they are told, but I'm concerned about the \"she couldn't find anything in her skin tone.\" Is the actor by any chance a person of color, & you are white? Show a little sympathy for what could be true difficulties finding hose to match her skin tone. Instead of just chastising her, you could have asked another woman of color where she gets her nylons, etc.", "nta. omg, what a snowflake..if this is her career, she is not going to do well..wow.", "INFO: Why do you not have tights in the students skin tone?

That doing so as a consequence of failing to consider the issue of asking for 'skin tone' tights in 2023 just makes this a true face palm moment, that you compound by somehow not understanding why someone would feel uncomfortable not wearing tights.

Read the comments.", "College age students are mature enough to understand racism", "Could it be the student hadn\u2019t shaved her legs and so didn\u2019t want to get them out?!", "That\u2019s not what OP said AT ALL. \n\nFirst you need to understand that there are different kinds of actors in this show. The ones who are paid have contracts with requirements. One such requirement is providing the costumes. OP has the costume needed for the one paid actress who, in this case, is Caucasian. In the next show, if that actress is of a different skin tone, OP will provide the appropriate costume needed. \n\nTHIS actress is a student. She is not paid or on a contract. \n\nYou can disagree with OP but doing so with lies makes you look the fool.", "It didnt really matter for it to exactly match skin-tone. The problem with the black tights were that they were thick and opaque, making the solid black stick out a lot. Even something sorta kind-of close and sheer wouldve been okay since they ended up giving her the (white) leads spare hose anyways", "Budget.\n\nWe are required by contract to have them for equity actors so I only purchase for the one equity actress in the show.

I could walk into a department store right now and find 30 different shades of hosiery, suitable for numerous flesh tones of both Caucasians and people of color.\n\nSimilarly, she could have ordered from the Internet, which has even more choices.\n\nInstead, she wore opaque black hosiery.  Here\u2019s the issue: Nobody\u2019s skin tone is opaque black.  Therefore, the girl wasn\u2019t wearing (her) flesh-toned pantyhose.\n\nHeck, failing ALL of that, the professor finally offered a compromise in which the girl would go bare-legged and wear no pantyhose.  This would have required no work on her part.\n\nThe girl refused that.\n\nThis isn\u2019t racism.  This is a 21 year old who threw a tantrum when her \u201cmean\u201d professor told the student that she couldn\u2019t do exactly what she wanted.", "It isn\u2019t racism. The student could have chosen sheer black nylons or very dark tan nylons. Or she could have asked if the heavy black tights were appropriate. She could have asked OP for help if she didn\u2019t know what was appropriate. She did not do any of this. She ran out crying.", "I will say, this is the one area where I feel like you could've just gotten ahead of it.

Give it a few minutes to set. You\u2019re welcome.", "Yeah, I was pretty sure it was racism. Thank you for confirming your racism", "I think it's a valid point, but what is your plan moving forward? The issue is resolved, but the student might be feeling a lot of emotions and it's unclear why this issue happened in the first place -- maybe they had an unexpected cost last minute and couldn't afford the tights. Maybe they bought some, and the color was wildly different. Maybe they ripped them right after they bought them. There's a chance this wasn't a rude gesture, but some kind of other mishap that's embarrassing to share. \n\nNo matter the reason, you're right that they still messed up the soft skill. But if you're open to it, this could turn into a teaching moment and help them learn a lesson for how to handle such situations in the future. I don't think you're an AH if you wash your hands of the situation, but I do think this is an opportunity to help this student for the better.

This isn\u2019t an extreme demand on the part of the costume designer (though as it is a college production, regardless of union rules, they should have purchased tights/stockings for the entire cast as part of the costume budget or with an understanding they would be reimbursed by the actors and explained this at the time of casting).", "We unfortunately don\u2019t have the budget to stock many undergarments.  I actually got a bunch of items free this past year from a local storage unit clean out and a bunch of it walked off over Xmas break.

I watch fb for wardrobe unit clean outs and go get free stuff.  This year I went to three and got us a free sewing machine, iron, ironing board, steamer, Velcro, mens socks and some other supplies.  No womens undergarments though.  I also have been having an issue with supplies disappearing.  My entire stock of mens undershirts walked off.  Along with all my nice scissors.  I bring my own to work and keep them in my backpack.\n\nWhat I do for hair/makeup/shoes is provide a Google doc with examples and links to YouTube videos.  I\u2019m going to do this for nylons/tights moving forward.  I could tape it to the shop door with a QR code to links so students could scan it.  \n\nThe thing about students not having money for supplies is always a tough issue.  I do always tell students if they are having trouble affording something to come tell me and we will come up with a solution, but I need to time to find that solution.
