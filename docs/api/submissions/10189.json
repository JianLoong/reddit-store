I teach courses on clothing construction and design, and serve as a the advisor to design students.  We are lucky enough to have a unionized theater on our campus and get paid industry actors in to do our shows and then students in the program work within those shows (either as actors or behind the scenes) as a training program to go into the industry.  I serve as the costume designer for these shows so I am training costume majors as well as training student actors on proper costume/dressing room procedures and etiquette.\n\nIn theater unionized actors have their undergarments provided by the theater, non union actors do not.  We are currently doing a show that takes place in the 1950s and our stage crew has a small role as a gaggle of older women in the first act.  All stage crew were fitted with costumes (a t length dress, sweater, wig and hat) and I asked each students if they had shoes that would work.  If they didn\u2019t have shoes I could pull shoes from our closet for them.  But I did ask each student to get a pair of skin toned nylons or tights since women in that period wouldn\u2019t have bare legs.  Fittings were about 5 days before the first dress rehearsal.\n\nAt our first dress rehearsal (we only have two dress rehearsals before we open to the public) one student came out with black tights.  She had a cream colored shoe and purple dress so it just looked really distracting.  Before last nights dress rehearsal asked the student to please not wear the black tights again as we were taking pictures.  The student said they couldn\u2019t find anything in their skin tone so I said to just go without tights then because the black was very distracting from the overall picture.  The student pushed back a bit and I said again I would prefer no tights to the black tights because it looked very out of place.  That\u2019s my job is to make sure everyone on stage is dressed appropriately and in line with the story/time period.\n\nWell I guess I upset the student who didn\u2019t feel comfortable with bare legs.  They complained to the stage manager who came to have a \u201ctalk\u201d with me and then involved our boss, the show producer (the producer is one of the equity actors in the show so he can\u2019t see what the whole picture looks like).  I pushed back stating that the black tights looked very distracting.  I also feel like part of my job is training actors that if they are asked to get a supply, it is up to them to follow through.  You can\u2019t go on stage at a professional theater in something the wardrobe crew did not approve, if you enter the actors equity union you would be fined for doing so.  I had one back up pair of nylons for our lead female equity actress and the stage manager took those and gave them to the student.\n\nSo am I the AH for making the student uncomfortable by ask them to wear no tights? (For anyone wondering a t length dress is about midway between the knee and the ankle, so the student had about 6 inches of leg showing)\n\nETA: sorry I can\u2019t answer any more comments as I\u2019m at work for another show now.  Seems like a bit of a split audience but I will for sure work to be better that these types of things in the future.  I think adding a resource sheet to the door of the shop with links seems like a way to go.  We are a very small theater and I work alone and we don\u2019t really have much of a budget.  I pick up free items when I can and I will keep my eyes peeled for someone giving away tights/nylons of different shades to have on hand.

She is not a pre-teen.  She is in college.
