My bf began showing me BMWs and we went to see a 2017 BMW 3 series. It was 26k which was wild to me as I can get a new car for that price. I ended up with a Toyota Corolla cross for 14k and he called me boring for it. I don\u2019t care at all about cars so I don\u2019t mind a boring car. \n\nOn the other side he keeps complaining that women spend too much on clothes. I have the same amount of clothes as him but he doesn\u2019t seem to realize it and thinks I have far more clothes and spend way more than him on clothes. Because each of my pieces cost a lot more I buy a lot less of them. But they last for 5-10 years. Like I have 6 cashmere sweaters that are over $200 each but I buy 1 a year. I bought another one this year on 60% off and he complained that I spend way too much on these sweaters and I challenged him to figure out how much he spends on clothes vs me. We both went through our credit cards. He spent almost double what I did on clothes because he bought 14 pieces and I bought 3 this year. Because my stuff is really nice they just last forever. For example every 3 months he needs a new pair of jeans because his rips. I have the same pair for over a decade. Mine cost over $100 and his was $30. He needs winter boots every year and it\u2019s usually leaking water by spring. My boots are 5 years old and still fine but his is $50 and mine are $200. He got mad and said each of my clothes are still way more expensive and I spend way too much per piece. I had spent a long time trying to make the point to him that better stuff is worth the price and pointed out he spends a lot on his car. He has a Audi A4 and it\u2019s like $900 a month while any car would do so why is he wasting money on cars but when I buy a sweater that lasts for years it\u2019s a waste of money? Because even he admits in terms of mileage, a Toyota probably will do more miles over its life than his Audi. He snapped back that he\u2019s not ok with a boring car and ignored me for 2 days. I feel like he\u2019s ok with spending way too much on a car because it\u2019s a guy thing but since clothes are girly it\u2019s a waste.

And he can want a 'nicer' car or whatever, just like, even if OP's clothes didn't last longer than her BF's, she could still want 'nicer' clothes.\n\nI also want to note: OP, buying clothes that last longer and are more expensive (and taking care of them) is not only apparently a good financial decision, but a good ethical one as well. $30 jeans and $50 boots are much more likely to have utilised sweatshop labour, and it's much worse for the environment to replace items more often. There are some people who don't have the money to buy quality things, but people who choose to buy 4 cheap items from fast fashion rather than 1 more likely sustainable item annoy me.", "\ud83d\ude02 Why do so many of these exist", "Came here specifically looking for this comment!

There's a difference between people getting stuck repurchasing cheaper items bc of their finances & someone who doesn't understand money in general. \nBetter quality shoes (if maintained) can be resoled & last decades longer.

If you buy quality, you can have comfortable shoes that fit really well and wear really well, and use local businesses to keep them for years.
