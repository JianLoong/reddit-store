Recently my beloved Honda Accord died after 320k miles and I had to immediately get another car as public transport isn\u2019t an option. My bf began showing me BMWs and we went to see a 2017 BMW 3 series. It was 26k which was wild to me as I can get a new car for that price. I ended up with a Toyota Corolla cross for 14k and he called me boring for it. I don\u2019t care at all about cars so I don\u2019t mind a boring car. \n\nOn the other side he keeps complaining that women spend too much on clothes. I have the same amount of clothes as him but he doesn\u2019t seem to realize it and thinks I have far more clothes and spend way more than him on clothes. Because each of my pieces cost a lot more I buy a lot less of them. But they last for 5-10 years. Like I have 6 cashmere sweaters that are over $200 each but I buy 1 a year. I bought another one this year on 60% off and he complained that I spend way too much on these sweaters and I challenged him to figure out how much he spends on clothes vs me. We both went through our credit cards. He spent almost double what I did on clothes because he bought 14 pieces and I bought 3 this year. Because my stuff is really nice they just last forever. For example every 3 months he needs a new pair of jeans because his rips. I have the same pair for over a decade. Mine cost over $100 and his was $30. He needs winter boots every year and it\u2019s usually leaking water by spring. My boots are 5 years old and still fine but his is $50 and mine are $200. He got mad and said each of my clothes are still way more expensive and I spend way too much per piece. I had spent a long time trying to make the point to him that better stuff is worth the price and pointed out he spends a lot on his car. He has a Audi A4 and it\u2019s like $900 a month while any car would do so why is he wasting money on cars but when I buy a sweater that lasts for years it\u2019s a waste of money? Because even he admits in terms of mileage, a Toyota probably will do more miles over its life than his Audi. He snapped back that he\u2019s not ok with a boring car and ignored me for 2 days. I feel like he\u2019s ok with spending way too much on a car because it\u2019s a guy thing but since clothes are girly it\u2019s a waste. But it pissed him off when he saw I actually spent less on the \u201cgirly\u201d things than him.
