All the other stuff is essentially useless here because we're talking about safety on the road, and that means all weather, rain, snow, etc., times day or night, situations of possible impairment like bars or parties, and so, and so on.  No one has anything to say other than paragraphs about how she likes and wants to wear them.\n\nWe all know why they are popular.  They makes women's calves look shapely. Nylons did that too.  But there are quite a lot of doctors out there who will tell you straight up that since the woman's foot is carrying her weight in a detrimental way, prolonged wear of heels will result in damaged and misshapen toes, great wear and tear on the joints of the tarsals and meta tarsal bones, problems with constricted blood flow over long periods, corns, blisters, and more.  Did you know that once a toenail becomes misshapen, it will always grow that way.  Nothing will put them back.  I haven't even gotten to the twisted ankle falls that are common to heel wearers.  \n\nBut let's address the real question: Are they safe, and if not, why?  I did the simple thing and Googled the phrase \"Research is it safe to wear high heel while driving\".\n\nThe answer is one that will be inobvious to many.  High heeled shoes ARE considered unsafe footwear by a preponderance of the road safety organizations and and medical institutions that have addressed the matter.  Vehicles are simply not designed to be driven in anything other than flat shoes. (NO flip flops either! They are worse than high heels!)  A car's foot pedals are set and calibrated so that your foot is entirely parallel to the surface of the brake lever.  This connection gives you the greatest control and the least chance of an accident.  But wearing heels changes that equation.  You can't guage 100% how much pressure you're using to use the pedals, and the heels hold so much of your foot out of the leg/foot right angle plane, that you're not using the safest muscles and tendons to ensure stability while changing pedals.  Add to that equation, foot fatigue and the slick soles of heels, the possibility of losing control because of the shoes simply does exist.  And I didn't even dive into the statistics regarding injuries both in and out of a car.  One thing is for sure, enough such incidents HAVE occurred that looking into it  yourself is something I'd highly recommend.   There is quite a lot of data out there and people who feel that cars and heels are dangerous.\n\nBoyfriend loves girlfriend a lot, and he's got the nagging feeling that her seemingly innocent practice could lead to an accident, and he's having trouble dismissing that idea as handily as she does.  I think she might not listen to him; not even to meet him halfway like a good mate should.  Yeah, you may have the right to wear the shoes you want, but frankly, it does not come with a free pass from common sense or being safe.  Choose to ignore those facets, and you'll get to know the ER decor a lot more than you want.  It only takes one day with black ice to show you just how wrong your decisions can really be.\n\n(I made a mistake on black ice once, and have permanent leg damage as a result.)\n\nWhile he didn't handle it diplomatically,  I think both are assholes here.  She for being stubborn and selfish, and him for not choosing a better pair of shoes than sneakers.  She needs to be more flexible a willing to listen to his concerns.  He needs to try to find a way to keep it from sounding like a personal attack on her shoe choices.  His solution is a valid one too.  A good pair of driving shoes will be less wear on the more expensive heels.", "Over here, the only legal shoes to drive must have a full sole, closed toes and a way to stay on the foot. Barefoot is not allowed. There's been discussion if sneakers with the laces undone qualify.\n\nI don't think you'd get fined for driving in heels if they spotted it, say when the police officer is guiding traffic on a detour (maybe when the traffic lights went out). But if you peaserear-ended someone, it'd certainly be considered an aggravating factor", "no im so glad you posted this bc heels/platforms are not safe to drive in. like he could handle discussing it with his gf better and just her insecurity in general, but he is right to be concerned about her driving in heels", "Well it\u2019s the same reasoning behind why wearing flipflops whilst driving is a bad idea.

And she wore a high ish heel all the time. Now she can't without extreme pain and her knees hurt constantly. Her back is also shot because she was balancing 34 f's on top of all that.

Yet I was the asshole when I tried to express my concern. I'm an ex drug addict, so I get it. \n\nYou can never be the asshole for caring about someone you love. I don't doubt women drive all the time in heels. But what are you going to do when the heel gets caught in the pedal somehow? Or you missplace your foot slightly and the heel prevents you from hitting the brake in an emergency? I'm in the UK. we all drive manuals here mostly, so there's lots of foot movement. A heel is going to complicate that a lot.", "[removed]", "If you wear the same type of shoe everyday that's what you're used too so I doubt she wouldn't know how much pressure to apply in order to stop correctly.
