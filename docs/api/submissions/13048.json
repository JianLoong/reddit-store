All the other stuff is essentially useless here because we're talking about safety on the road, and that means all weather, rain, snow, etc., times day or night, situations of possible impairment like bars or parties, and so, and so on.  No one has anything to say other than paragraphs about how she likes and wants to wear them.\n\nWe all know why they are popular.  They makes women's calves look shapely. Nylons did that too.  But there are quite a lot of doctors out there who will tell you straight up that since the woman's foot is carrying her weight in a detrimental way, prolonged wear of heels will result in damaged and misshapen toes, great wear and tear on the joints of the tarsals and meta tarsal bones, problems with constricted blood flow over long periods, corns, blisters, and more.  Did you know that once a toenail becomes misshapen, it will always grow that way.  Nothing will put them back.  I haven't even gotten to the twisted ankle falls that are common to heel wearers.  \n\nBut let's address the real question: Are they safe, and if not, why?  I did the simple thing and Googled the phrase \"Research is it safe to wear high heel while driving\".\n\nThe answer is one that will be inobvious to many.  High heeled shoes ARE considered unsafe footwear by a preponderance of the road safety organizations and and medical institutions that have addressed the matter.  Vehicles are simply not designed to be driven in anything other than flat shoes. (NO flip flops either! They are worse than high heels!)  A car's foot pedals are set and calibrated so that your foot is entirely parallel to the surface of the brake lever.  This connection gives you the greatest control and the least chance of an accident.  But wearing heels changes that equation.  You can't guage 100% how much pressure you're using to use the pedals, and the heels hold so much of your foot out of the leg/foot right angle plane, that you're not using the safest muscles and tendons to ensure stability while changing pedals.  Add to that equation, foot fatigue and the slick soles of heels, the possibility of losing control because of the shoes simply does exist.  And I didn't even dive into the statistics regarding injuries both in and out of a car.  One thing is for sure, enough such incidents HAVE occurred that looking into it  yourself is something I'd highly recommend.   There is quite a lot of data out there and people who feel that cars and heels are dangerous.\n\nBoyfriend loves girlfriend a lot, and he's got the nagging feeling that her seemingly innocent practice could lead to an accident, and he's having trouble dismissing that idea as handily as she does.  I think she might not listen to him; not even to meet him halfway like a good mate should.  Yeah, you may have the right to wear the shoes you want, but frankly, it does not come with a free pass from common sense or being safe.  Choose to ignore those facets, and you'll get to know the ER decor a lot more than you want.  It only takes one day with black ice to show you just how wrong your decisions can really be.\n\n(I made a mistake on black ice once, and have permanent leg damage as a result.)\n\nWhile he didn't handle it diplomatically,  I think both are assholes here.  She for being stubborn and selfish, and him for not choosing a better pair of shoes than sneakers.  She needs to be more flexible a willing to listen to his concerns.  He needs to try to find a way to keep it from sounding like a personal attack on her shoe choices.  His solution is a valid one too.  A good pair of driving shoes will be less wear on the more expensive heels.", "Over here, the only legal shoes to drive must have a full sole, closed toes and a way to stay on the foot. Barefoot is not allowed. There's been discussion if sneakers with the laces undone qualify.\n\nI don't think you'd get fined for driving in heels if they spotted it, say when the police officer is guiding traffic on a detour (maybe when the traffic lights went out). But if you peaserear-ended someone, it'd certainly be considered an aggravating factor", "no im so glad you posted this bc heels/platforms are not safe to drive in. like he could handle discussing it with his gf better and just her insecurity in general, but he is right to be concerned about her driving in heels", "Well it\u2019s the same reasoning behind why wearing flipflops whilst driving is a bad idea.

And she wore a high ish heel all the time. Now she can't without extreme pain and her knees hurt constantly. Her back is also shot because she was balancing 34 f's on top of all that.

Yet I was the asshole when I tried to express my concern. I'm an ex drug addict, so I get it. \n\nYou can never be the asshole for caring about someone you love. I don't doubt women drive all the time in heels. But what are you going to do when the heel gets caught in the pedal somehow? Or you missplace your foot slightly and the heel prevents you from hitting the brake in an emergency? I'm in the UK. we all drive manuals here mostly, so there's lots of foot movement. A heel is going to complicate that a lot.", "[removed]", "If you wear the same type of shoe everyday that's what you're used too so I doubt she wouldn't know how much pressure to apply in order to stop correctly.

And in fact, I get what OP\u2019s gf is saying about being able to pivot. You use the heel as the pivot point and it is easy to switch between pedals.  (Assuming she also drives an automatic as Im sure OP would have specifically referenced the clutch if she was driving a stick.", "Exactly. I\u2019m a male saying this, and fully expect some downvotes. Maybe a small amount of heel could be ok? But cars aren\u2019t designed for that. It is dangerous, your foot could slip, the tension of the pedals that you would be used to would change, it is dangerous if you haven\u2019t done it before. If she has done it consistently for a while with no issues, that\u2019s safe. There\u2019s nothing sexist about it, if I wore high heels in a car I would be in danger, until I learned how to do it right.", "And platforms, but only because you can't feel the pedals through the thick soles. Normal heels, you can feel the pedals just fine.", "Thank you, my driving instructor as well as my parents always told me not to drive with heels or flip flop, and for this reason I always have a pair of flats somewhere when I know I'll drive.", "I've never driven in heels so I have zero experience but the difficulty I could imagine would be all clutch based, they seem to have driven an automatic, so basically a go-cart.", "Okay, OP I'm 5'2\" as well and let me tell you, it realy is easier to drive with heels if you're my height.\n\nThe pedals are usualy a bit too far away and you need to move the seat very far forward in many cars, hell in some I struggle to have my feet on the floor.\n\nThe heels fix that.\n\nThat aside, I drive a manual transmission car and can heel-toe downshift under braking while wearing heels.\n\nThey do not impede my driving at all.\n\nGiven you're 5'6\", I think your feet should probably be small enough to find heels that fit you to try it out yourself (I'd suggest going for block style heels as a beginner)", "i find it easier to drive in heels than any other shoe. the hardest shoes for me to drive in? thick boots (think snow boots, hiking boots\u2026) because of the limited range of motion it provides. for anyone who wears them regularly, heels become easy to drive in. your gf got cut off in traffic, it has nothing to do with the shoes she was wearing! good idea saying youre sorry, you definitely owe her an apology", "An opinion is not a fact. Do you have any sources? Just because you have a difficult time wearing heels hardly means it's true for everyone.", "Citations needed", "Right? It\u2019s illegal in my country to drive in heels or flip flops because it\u2019s unsafe", "I think people are forgetting that those who wear heels also just drive barefoot a lot. I love heels, and I love flip flops- in both cases when I get in my car, 90% of the time I just slip them off and drive barefoot just for long term comfort.", "so the other driver cut her off, and that's somehow her shoes' fault? that's goofy, OP. You're goofy.", "Same here. The only thing I won't wear driving is flip flops.", "A brake pedal in most cars is a flap of plastic and the heel of a shoe is another relatively thin slab of material. The way brake pedals in most cars are operated is typically by using one's heel as a pivot for the toes/front half of your feet. If that pivot is made more unstable by the pointed heel of a pump, the force applied through that pivot (or pressing motion) is made more uneven or scattered. There's also the issue of the heel-point potentially catching on the brake pedal's underside or its ridges, interfering with the brake mechanism.\n\n>there is no proof that driving in heels (if youre experienced in doing so) is dangerous.\n\nThis is technically correct in that the longer an individual is able to drive in heels without issues, their driving record is considered evidence toward driving in heels being less dangerous. But that's like saying \"there's no proof that running with scissors is dangerous if you're experienced in doing so,\" or \"there's no proof that texting and driving is dangerous if you're experienced in doing so.\" Do you understand?\n\nRear-ending a car is almost always the driver's fault.", "The examples you\u2019ve listed don\u2019t have the potential to disfigure or kill another human being\u2026\n\nHeels are dangerous to drive in, it has been proven beyond doubt.", "YTA  My first thought when he brought up the height difference is, he has a problem with his height. When she's in heels, he doesn't tower over her as much and therefore has a problem with her wearing heels. Also, it's HER car so she can drive in what she wants. It sounds like, he's never worn heels and does he ever drive?  It's not difficult to rear-end someone who changes lanes suddenly. Happens everyday where I live.", "I'll tag on to ya'll and go YTA here. \n\nAs a woman, I can assure you that my shoes have no influence on my driving capability. And I live in a country where driving stick is the norm. \n\nIf anything before I had access to cruise control I preferred to wear heels on longer drives because my foot is at a more comfortable angle on the accelerator when driving the same speed for long periods of time.", "I think if she told you it's fine, you should drop it.", "> Barefoot is not allowed. \n\nThis I never got. I found driving barefoot to be very natural, the sole of my actual foot could gauge the pressure on the pedal very easily and precisely; There's no way that it's more dangerous than driving with thick (but flat-soled) boots on. \n\nSeveral people told me \"Barefoot is not allowed\" but I never saw a written law to that effect. Nothing in the Highway code etc. This probably depends on exactly where you are.", "Didn't Mythbusters bust this? They ran tests in several types of shoes. If remember correctly, on shoes that were too big to fit the pedals made any difference.", "Actually in the UK it doesn\u2019t specify what shoe is illegal.
