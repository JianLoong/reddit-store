He just has a hangup about her shoes.", "The thing is I was not saying she is a bad driver, and was just offering a suggestion, she drives very well and is very skilled at parking in the tightest of spots. It was more of a just in case thing as I get scared looking at those shoes.", "every person should have to buy a pair of driving/racing shoes to be able to drive. $20000 fine snd 30-day license suspension for not having them on /s", "The mansplaining an accident you didn\u2019t even witness.", "I think you just need to trust your girl a little more and stop feeling like you know better than her. I\u2019m going to stereotype here a little: It\u2019s not uncommon for men to patronize women about \u201cunsafe driving\u201d when there\u2019s been zero proof of said woman driving hazardously.\n\nWomen experience this superior attitude on the daily (with more than just driving), and it gets old really quick. \n\nIf I was her, I would be tempted to just donate the tennis shoes, because it was a rude gift. Like, \u201cYou\u2019re cooking was good! \u2026 Here\u2019s some cooking lessons, please take them now.\u201d rude. (You drive well. \u2026 Here\u2019s some tennis shoes, because you\u2019re actually dangerously driving, please wear them even though I know it\u2019s not really your fault.)\n\nIt\u2019s a backhanded gift. It\u2019s simply not nice.\n\nThe road to hell is paved with good intentions, and personally, I think you should apologize and reaffirm that you care about her, but you understand that you were being a bit of a jerk.", "Wow. This is infuriating to read. \u201cIt\u2019s not her fault but maybe if she did what I said she could have avoided it anyway\u201d. My goood. Or maybe if she wore a different shirt? Or pants? Or maybe, it could have been avoided if an idiot didn\u2019t cut her off?", "I was taught in drivers Ed not to wear heels when driving. And anytime I do I feel so unsafe cause i over exaggerate on the pedals so I take them off and rather drive barefoot.", "It's not illegal there. Hasn't been since sometime in 1990's..", "And never wore heels but still knows better! Thank the Lord for smart people like him!", "Bad driving =/= unsafe driving\n\nUnsafe drivers do things like text while driving, speeding, drive cars that need major mechanical work/new tires, etc.  They can be perfectly competent at the skill of driving, but they engage in behavior that puts them at risk of things going wrong", "Yeah, no. Good drivers pay attention to the road and react appropriately to their environment. If you text and drive, or drive too fast for the conditions, you are a bad driver.\n\nPeople can also differ in what makes them safe. I personally don't listen to music while I drive, because I find I drive faster when I do; I only listen to podcasts or the news behind the wheel. For some people, it's the other way around because talk is distracting to them and music is better.\n\nOP's girlfriend seems to be a perfectly good driver, and she says she doesn't like to wear flats when she drives. If she always wears heels, then forcing her to wear flats could actually be more dangerous, since she'd have to change how she operates the pedals. Without some clear and pressing evidence that the GF, personally, is being unsafe, then let the woman make her own damn decisions about what's best for her."]}
