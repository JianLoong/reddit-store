She is self conscious about her height but it is not really a big deal when we are together as I am short. She is 5'2 and I am 5'6.\n\nThe issue however is when we go out together she normally drives as it is her car and she drives in her heels. I repeatedly tell her she should switch to flats and not drive in them as it is dangerous but she refuses and says she knows how to drive in them and is used to it and claims in some cases it is easier as you can pivot between pedals easier. I think she is not being honest as I can't possibly see how it would be easier.\n\nLast week she got into a small accident and rear ended someone, I was not there but a car changed lanes in front of her and she rear ended it. I bought her some sneakers and told her to use them as driving shoes and left them in her car and she called me an AH and said her accident had nothing to do with her shoes and that I should drop it.\n\nAITA here? I just want her to be safe.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for all the responses, I can't respond to them all, but I feel I pushed the issue too much and apologized to her. The responses seem mixed but I have spoken to her more about it and I guess it is something really subjective, and depends on the design of the car, pedals, the specific shoe as not all heels are equal, drivers height, practice in them etc. In her case she says in her car, as long as she has good quality floor mats she has no issues and she prefers the seat position she uses when she drives in heels and the only shoes she has trouble with are flip flops or any shoe with slippery soles, which is fair as I have trouble in some slippery dress shoes as well.\n\nThe laws of most places seem to not call it out specifically, some have laws that vaugely say proper footwear and I saw some court cases where heels were blamed or flip flops but that is only when it could be proved they were a clear cause of the accident. \n\nEDIT2: Also we just heard back that she is not at fault from the insurance.", "created_utc": 1679629116, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1207wi2/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_she_should_not/", "score": 3898, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

All the other stuff is essentially useless here because we're talking about safety on the road, and that means all weather, rain, snow, etc., times day or night, situations of possible impairment like bars or parties, and so, and so on.  No one has anything to say other than paragraphs about how she likes and wants to wear them.\n\nWe all know why they are popular.  They makes women's calves look shapely. Nylons did that too.  But there are quite a lot of doctors out there who will tell you straight up that since the woman's foot is carrying her weight in a detrimental way, prolonged wear of heels will result in damaged and misshapen toes, great wear and tear on the joints of the tarsals and meta tarsal bones, problems with constricted blood flow over long periods, corns, blisters, and more.  Did you know that once a toenail becomes misshapen, it will always grow that way.  Nothing will put them back.  I haven't even gotten to the twisted ankle falls that are common to heel wearers.  \n\nBut let's address the real question: Are they safe, and if not, why?  I did the simple thing and Googled the phrase \"Research is it safe to wear high heel while driving\".\n\nThe answer is one that will be inobvious to many.  High heeled shoes ARE considered unsafe footwear by a preponderance of the road safety organizations and and medical institutions that have addressed the matter.  Vehicles are simply not designed to be driven in anything other than flat shoes. (NO flip flops either! They are worse than high heels!)  A car's foot pedals are set and calibrated so that your foot is entirely parallel to the surface of the brake lever.  This connection gives you the greatest control and the least chance of an accident.  But wearing heels changes that equation.  You can't guage 100% how much pressure you're using to use the pedals, and the heels hold so much of your foot out of the leg/foot right angle plane, that you're not using the safest muscles and tendons to ensure stability while changing pedals.  Add to that equation, foot fatigue and the slick soles of heels, the possibility of losing control because of the shoes simply does exist.  And I didn't even dive into the statistics regarding injuries both in and out of a car.  One thing is for sure, enough such incidents HAVE occurred that looking into it  yourself is something I'd highly recommend.   There is quite a lot of data out there and people who feel that cars and heels are dangerous.\n\nBoyfriend loves girlfriend a lot, and he's got the nagging feeling that her seemingly innocent practice could lead to an accident, and he's having trouble dismissing that idea as handily as she does.  I think she might not listen to him; not even to meet him halfway like a good mate should.  Yeah, you may have the right to wear the shoes you want, but frankly, it does not come with a free pass from common sense or being safe.  Choose to ignore those facets, and you'll get to know the ER decor a lot more than you want.  It only takes one day with black ice to show you just how wrong your decisions can really be.\n\n(I made a mistake on black ice once, and have permanent leg damage as a result.)\n\nWhile he didn't handle it diplomatically,  I think both are assholes here.  She for being stubborn and selfish, and him for not choosing a better pair of shoes than sneakers.  She needs to be more flexible a willing to listen to his concerns.  He needs to try to find a way to keep it from sounding like a personal attack on her shoe choices.  His solution is a valid one too.  A good pair of driving shoes will be less wear on the more expensive heels.", "Over here, the only legal shoes to drive must have a full sole, closed toes and a way to stay on the foot. Barefoot is not allowed. There's been discussion if sneakers with the laces undone qualify.\n\nI don't think you'd get fined for driving in heels if they spotted it, say when the police officer is guiding traffic on a detour (maybe when the traffic lights went out). But if you peaserear-ended someone, it'd certainly be considered an aggravating factor", "no im so glad you posted this bc heels/platforms are not safe to drive in. like he could handle discussing it with his gf better and just her insecurity in general, but he is right to be concerned about her driving in heels", "Well it\u2019s the same reasoning behind why wearing flipflops whilst driving is a bad idea.

Yet I was the asshole when I tried to express my concern. I'm an ex drug addict, so I get it. \n\nYou can never be the asshole for caring about someone you love. I don't doubt women drive all the time in heels. But what are you going to do when the heel gets caught in the pedal somehow? Or you missplace your foot slightly and the heel prevents you from hitting the brake in an emergency? I'm in the UK. we all drive manuals here mostly, so there's lots of foot movement. A heel is going to complicate that a lot.", "[removed]", "If you wear the same type of shoe everyday that's what you're used too so I doubt she wouldn't know how much pressure to apply in order to stop correctly.

is every rancher and trucker around an unsafe driver because of their boots? \n\nno not if they are consistently wearing them to drive\n\nbut if I've been driving in thin-soled trainers all year and then suddenly switch to driving in work boots I am absolutely going to have to make adjustments and I'm going to need to be more careful\n\nmy foot is going to be at a different angle, the way pressure is applied is going to be different, and my instincts will be off\n\nit's not *exactly* like hopping behind the wheel of a car you've never driven before but it's relatively close, especially if it's impossible for you to adjust the seat in such a way that your foot is at exactly the same angle as it is in your normal car\n\nnow there is actually something specific to heels that makes many of them dangerous to drive in but it has nothing to do with the heel elevation or anything you'll find cited by experts (because most of them are entirely unaware of this)\n\nmost modern heels are designed with a sole that is narrower than the actual width of the foot. they do this to make women's shoes looks smaller, daintier. and in some shoes the way they accomplish this is by having curved soles\n\nnow this effect can be a very very mild, only a few millimetres. or it can be much much more extreme, leaving you walking on only a thin strip in the middle of your foot\n\nthis is one of the reasons certain heels can be incredibly uncomfortable to wear even though they don't look like it. what from the outside might look like an incredibly modest and comfortable heel may actually have a severely curved sole. and heel height and thickness aside, it's never fun walking on a thin sliver of your foot while the sides of your feet are essentially hovering in air  \n\nthis can obviously be pretty dangerous. if it's incredibly minor and almost all of your foot is actually making contact with the pedal then it's not a problem. but if only half of your foot is making contact? hahahaha NO. less than half? so incredibly dangerous. in extreme cases where the sole is very rounded your foot may even slip when you try to apply pressure\n\nnow this isn't true for all heels and you can definitely find shoes that don't have this \"feature\". you can also have heels modified by a cobbler so that the soles don't curve in. a cobbler can also give smooth soled heels some texture and grip (which I highly recommend even if you're not driving in them)\n\nobviously many heels will never be safe for any of a variety of reasons. some heels restrict foot movement too much. some heels the heel of the shoe is too small and doesn't make enough contact with the ground. if the heel is too high the angle that you have to have your foot at can be uncomfortable or one where you can't apply pressure properly. some heels can be flimsy. and pretty much any of the dangers of particular types of sandals can also apply to some heels\n\nso yes heels absolutely absolutely can be dangerous\n\nbut they are not *inherently* dangerous\n\nand the issue that you have focused on is actually one of the least problematic things about heels and is a feature that is commonly found in shoes that are not heels\n\nelevated heels are simply not inherently dangerous and if they were then so many other shoes besides high heels would not be safe to drive in - including an enormous amount of men's shoes\n\nand if you're too short for the heel of your foot to rest on the ground when your toes are on the pedal? wearing a shoe with an elevated heel can be helpful safety wise\n\nnow obviously it's much more ideal to modify the car to fit you than you to fit the car. a lot of modern cars you can adjust where the pedals are. you also have more ability to adjust your seat. and usually have the ability to adjust the wheel placement somewhat\n\nso if you're short, you're less likely to find yourself choosing between a position that gives you proper visibility and one where your heel can rest on the ground. but if you do find yourself in that position, adding an inch or two to your leg length via shoes with an elevated heel or an elevated sole can be a huge help\n\nbut basically the rules of driving footwear are: \n\n* the footwear should not move around or slip\n* your foot should not be moving around inside of the shoe\n* you want the distance between the heel of your foot and the floor of your car to remain consistent day to day\n* you want the angle of your foot on the pedal to remain consistent day to day\n* you want the amount of force it takes to move your foot, pivot, and apply pressure to be consistent day to day \n\nand whenever you do change what footwear you used to drive you should be more careful and pay more attention and be more cautious - just like when you were driving a vehicle that you are unfamiliar with", "Well that's dumb", "I assume it has to do with traction on the pedal itself, a bare foot is much more slippery than a shoe.
