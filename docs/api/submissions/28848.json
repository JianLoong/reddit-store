One being Jess, 36f. For some context, Jess and her husband share a car. Jess is a SAHM, and normally has their car during the day while her husband is as work. She run errands does pickup/drop off for her 4 year old that goes to Pre-K. \n\nWell, recently Jess\u2019 husband was promoted at his job, and this requires him to drive to several different stores (no company vehicle.) so he is using the car now. I was not aware, but apparently today was his first day in his new role, and she was without a car to get her son from school. \n\nI as well, am a SAHM, but my daughter was home sick from school today with a fairly high fever. Well, Jess reached out this afternoon asking if I could give her a ride to pick up her son from school. I said I wouldn\u2019t be due to my own child being sick, and I didn\u2019t want to bring her out of the house if I didn\u2019t have to. Plus, I\u2019m not trying to get others sick. She understood, and then followed up with asking if she could take my car since it\u2019s just sitting today. I said no. There\u2019s a few thought behind this, but ultimately it comes down to two main points.\n\nA.) My car is a manual transmission. She has told me in the past that she has only driven a manual once, and it was when she was a teen. I\u2019m not trying to have my car be her guinea pig to try and re-learn a manual transmission. Especially without me in the car with her.\n\nB.) I\u2019m not comfortable letting others borrow my car. It\u2019s a massive liability. \n\nShe was taken back when I said no to her request. She was able to arrange a ride to go pick up her son from school. But she\u2019ll be in the same situation on Monday when her son has school again. While I feel\nBad for her situation of only have one car and the needs for the car changing, I don\u2019t feel like I should be responsible for supplying a second vehicle for her to use. I\u2019m not totally opposed to helping pick up her son from school, since that seems to be when she needs the most help, but I\u2019m not comfortable loaning my car out either.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1697229128, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1777zmp/aita_for_not_letting_my_neighbor_borrow_my_car/", "score": 246, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your car is not available. \n\nThere are multiple reasons to say no. \n\n1) She doesn't know how to drive a stick shift/been way too many years since she drove one and you don't even know how many times/for how long that happened.\n\n2) Liability\n\n3) You might need it\n\n4) Because it makes you feel uncomfortable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf she were to get into an accident then what?  Now you have no vehicle either.  If she were to press the issue I would lean heavily on the fact that she has little to no experience driving a stick shift and that was many years ago.  You don't owe her an explanation however.  No is a complete sentence.  It gives people less to argue/debate about when you do not offer reasons.  No, I'm sorry.\n\nShe found another ride, you shouldn't feel bad about it.  They knew her husband would need the car and it was on them to come up with a plan A and a few contingency plans in case the plan A fell through.", "Nta. I let my neighbor borrow a nice cookie sheet a couple weeks ago and they still haven't given it back, which is problematic when one is a college student. You never know what someone is going to do with your trust.", "NTA.  No is a complete sentence.  \nDon\u2019t reply in the future.  Also- don\u2019t drive her around.  Her husband needs to take care of the situation he and his job created not you.", "Forget all the other details. Ask yourself this question\u2026. and if she brings it up again ask *her* too:  \u201cIf I didn\u2019t exist, what was the plan going to be?\u201d", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s YOUR car, it\u2019s your choice who drives it and who doesn\u2019t. \n\nThey\u2019re your neighbours, not your family. You do not have to go out of your way to help them, especially giving them your car to use\u2026 You don\u2019t know how they drive, don\u2019t know how they\u2019ll treat your car and they probably aren\u2019t covered in your insurance.\n\nDon\u2019t keep dwelling on this. It not NOT your responsibility. \nHer and a husband should\u2019ve thought about this and they should arrange a new car. She could catch a bus, a cab, Uber; there are many options. It\u2019s not up to you to deal with their problems.", "Give a few rides?  Yes.  Loan my vehicle which I  responsible for?  No.", "No. Stop asking the question.", "Nta. I don't lend my car out (even though its insured). Too many risks. I made an exception twice. Once when my sister was dog sitting for us because we live an hr away from her job & her car wouldn't make it that many trips. The day after we got back, tire blew out (my husband changes & rotates early, she just ran over something) then my daughter borrowed my jeep & transmission went out. Neither was to blame but could have easily been something questionable. Then,  who pays? But even when my own vehicle was down,  i never expected someone (esp who wasnt family) to lend me theirs", "Yup. And should something happen to the car if you loaned it out to her, I get the feeling she\u2019d make it out to be all your fault. You\u2019re being responsible and no is a complete sentence.", "What is that saying? \u201cPoor planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part\u201d?\n\nI'm sure Jess has known for awhile now that her husband would need their car. They should have planned accordingly.", "Agreed. My standard reply to that question is \u201cI don\u2019t lend my car out\u201d.  No excuse is needed. It may also minimize the chance of a similar request in the future.", "Yeah NTA. I\u2019d also use the reasoning that the neighbor isn\u2019t on the insurance. It sucks she doesn\u2019t have a car but she\u2019s gotta figure something else out.", "...a neighbor she's known for only a few months at that! Just for asking to borrow the car of a neighbor you met recently is suss, IMO\n\nNTA", "I've been married to a wonderful woman for 18 years now, but even she doesn't get to drive my cars.", "It would be. Say they crash into someone or run a person over. That person would sue the driver, and the car owner. They\u2019d claim the owners were negligent in loaning the car to driber", "It would be. Say they crash into someone or run a person over. That person would sue the driver, and the car owner. They\u2019d claim the owners were negligent in loaning the car to driver. How is drivers driving record? Any speeding tickets or prior accidents?  The rule is \u201csue them all, and let the court figure it out.\u201d  Also, if OP regularly loans the car to neighbor, but doesn\u2019t list her on the car insurance, the insurance company will say they don\u2019t have to pay because OP didn\u2019t list her as a regular driver. OP is screwed either way.", "Because empathy is a thing and it\u2019s normal to see someone you like in a less than optimal situation and think that must be unpleasant for them?", "Unless OP  puts Jess on OP's insurance regular use of the car without being put on the insurance means insurance will not cover if Jess was driving and something happens", "But, it's only a less than optimal situation because the neighbor didn't sort out how to pick up her own kid from school. A lack of planning on her part, does not constitute an emergency on OP's part", "Yup.. I was thinking similar to something like this. Insurance can be finicky. We only recently found out that my parents insurance means you have to list the youngest person driving the car and their birthday.. anyone younger than that is not covered as a driver if they drive the vehicle. Fortunately, even though I had been driving my parents' cars I've never been involved in an accident.", "Nobody said it\u2019s her fault or an emergency she needs to solve. It\u2019s normal to look at a situation and feel sorry for the person who is in it, even if it\u2019s not your fault.", "You can still feel bad for the situation. Again it\u2019s called empathy.", "If the neighbours car had broken down, sure. But this is a last minute ask, for a  situation they've known about for some time.\n\nThere's a chance there are mitigating circumstances - neighbour bought a new car, can't get it delivered for a week; can't afford a car; their arranged ride fell through; uber ceased to exist, etc. \n\nBut as it wasn't mentioned, we aren't privvy to those circumstances, so presumably OP isn't either. Sounds much like poor planning. \n\nIt's the kind of thing that should have a plan, and a backup. If OP was supposed to be the backup, they should have asked."]}
