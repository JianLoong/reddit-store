One being Jess, 36f. For some context, Jess and her husband share a car. Jess is a SAHM, and normally has their car during the day while her husband is as work. She run errands does pickup/drop off for her 4 year old that goes to Pre-K. \n\nWell, recently Jess\u2019 husband was promoted at his job, and this requires him to drive to several different stores (no company vehicle.) so he is using the car now. I was not aware, but apparently today was his first day in his new role, and she was without a car to get her son from school. \n\nI as well, am a SAHM, but my daughter was home sick from school today with a fairly high fever. Well, Jess reached out this afternoon asking if I could give her a ride to pick up her son from school. I said I wouldn\u2019t be due to my own child being sick, and I didn\u2019t want to bring her out of the house if I didn\u2019t have to. Plus, I\u2019m not trying to get others sick. She understood, and then followed up with asking if she could take my car since it\u2019s just sitting today. I said no. There\u2019s a few thought behind this, but ultimately it comes down to two main points.\n\nA.) My car is a manual transmission. She has told me in the past that she has only driven a manual once, and it was when she was a teen. I\u2019m not trying to have my car be her guinea pig to try and re-learn a manual transmission. Especially without me in the car with her.\n\nB.) I\u2019m not comfortable letting others borrow my car. It\u2019s a massive liability. \n\nShe was taken back when I said no to her request. She was able to arrange a ride to go pick up her son from school. But she\u2019ll be in the same situation on Monday when her son has school again. While I feel\nBad for her situation of only have one car and the needs for the car changing, I don\u2019t feel like I should be responsible for supplying a second vehicle for her to use. I\u2019m not totally opposed to helping pick up her son from school, since that seems to be when she needs the most help, but I\u2019m not comfortable loaning my car out either.\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1697229128, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1777zmp/aita_for_not_letting_my_neighbor_borrow_my_car/", "score": 596, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
