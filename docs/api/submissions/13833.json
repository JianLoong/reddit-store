It was our third date and he took me to one of his favorite restaurants. It was a hole-in-the-wall Polish/Hungarian place. We ordered our food and he ordered a sampler plate so I could try different things. There's very few things I don't eat with ranch, I just like it and helps make some things easier to eat so I always have it with my meals. When we got our food, I asked for some ranch. The waiter said they didn't have any and offered to bring out some kind of sour cream and dill sauces. I tried them and they just weren't the same. I told Michael I'd be right back, took my wallet and left the restaurant. I had seen a convenience store close by when arriving so I went, bought a bottle of ranch, and came back. \n\nMichael looked shocked but didn't say anything and ate his food. The food was great and we got some conversation going when the waiter came over and said outside food wasn't allowed. I said dressing isn't outside food and they didn't have what I needed to enjoy my meal. I didn't want to ruin the evening so I took it out to my car and returned. When we finished and left, Michael thanked me for coming out with him but said it was really offputting that I had to leave and go buy a bottle of dressing instead of just going one meal without it. I told him I wouldn't have had to do that if they had had ranch or any dressings like a normal restaurant. He didn't walk me to my car or anything and just left. I went home and told my roommate about my date and his attitude and she asked me if I was being serious. She thinks I had bad etiquette and embarrassed Michael to the point he was probably going to stop talking to me. I don't think what I did was really all that bad, it was a condiment, not an entire meal from someplace. Was I wrong for what I did?", "created_utc": 1680463732, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/129vd0m/aita_because_i_brought_a_bottle_of_ranch_into_a/", "score": 1010, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You embarrassed Michael in one of his favorite places. You left your date to go and buy sauce, which wasn't needed. You argued with the waiter while being totally and utterly wrong.\n\nMy biggest concerns however are:\n\nHow can you be so oblivious to not realizing you're an asshole\n\nAnd can you really not go one meal without ranch? If not, you have a clear problem and you need to change it ASAP. It's a very unhealthy addiction or eating habit you have going on.", "YTA for leaving Muchael and going to buy the ranch dressing, bringing it in the restaurant,  arguing with the waiter, and being so oblivious to how immature and inappropriate this was. \n\nBut good on you for giving Michael priceless insight into your priorities so he could nope on out after only three dates.", "Yes how dare a Polish/Hungarian restaurant not have an American condimemt.....\n\nYTA and yeah don't bet on another date because you couldn't have one meal without ranch.", "YTA- the restaurant was absolutely right about the outside food matter. \n\nIt was embarrassing that you did this and you talked back to the waitstaff when they told you that you couldn't have outside food. Ranch dressing isn't food, per se, but you also can't bring in drinks, etc. Then Michael brought up your choices and you defended them. Maybe the food wasn't your favorite, but you could've just eaten it. Or if ranch dressing is such a dealbreaker for you, you need to state that.", "Yeah, YTA.\n\nDid you even try to enjoy the food without the ranch? This is so gross to me. \n\nWhy don\u2019t you just eat ranch since it seems that\u2019s all you enjoy?", "YTA the waiter and your ex will be telling that story for a long time", "YTA and must be a literal child. Couldnt even go without it so you had to LEAVE mid date and buy it, then argue with the waiter and embarrass your date. Icing on the cake is even your roommate says you were wrong for your actions. Bonus points for saying the restaurant needed ranch like a normal restaurant. News flash kid, a restaurant doesnt need to have ranch especially when its a NON AMERICAN ETHNIC restaurant. Youre embarrassing. Grow up.", "YTA. Do you seriously put ranch on everything? It was incredibly rude to leave and come back with ranch- rude to him AND to the diner. I hope this is fake because I would have been absolutely mortified if I took someone to one of my favourite places to eat and they did that. I might be too embarrassed to even go back there. I certainly wouldn\u2019t be seeing you again, who wants to deal with that the rest of their life? Better to not waste anyone\u2019s time.", "YTA\n\nNot being able to sit through a meal without a specific condiment is quite childish.", "Omg, YTA. That is very rude and entitled behavior, both rude to your date and the restaurant.

Sorry, but it\u2019s behavior like this that make other countries look down on Americans.", "YTA big time!! Yes that IS outside food and you were really very entitled and bratty about the situation. It\u2019s also tacky! He\u2019s right, you can go one meal without it and your response to him is just plain RUDE ABD ENTITLED", "YTA. Be a grown up. You can eat without ranch. There is absolutely no way I would continue to date someone who did this.", "YTA\n\nIt was very embarrassing for your date. Bringing your own dressing into a restaurant is rude and ill mannered. As an adult, you should absolutely be able to get through the occasional meal without ranch dressing.", "YTA\n\nThe whole reason dating exists is so people can find out important facts about someone like \"I'm unwilling to go a single meal without ranch\" and \"I'll call the cuisines that don't serve ranch dressing abnormal.\"\n\nYes, this was terrible etiquette.", "YTA. FYI, not every restaurant, especially those with ethic foods, are going to serve ranch.

You insulted your date, you insulted the restaurant, and now you're insulting an entire ethnicity.", "YTA", "YTA \n\nYou don\u2019t bring outside food or drinks to restaurants.", "YTA.\n\nOne, you are old enough to know that restaurants do not allow guests to bring in food from outside. Arguing that it's a condiment and not food is disingenuous and stupid.\n\nTwo, you are obsessed with ranch dressing, which is idiotic. You can't just once in a while simply do without it?

You're eating ranch ranch ranch, nothing but ranch.", "YTA - I\u2019d be embarrassed if parents did this for a child. As an adult it is inexcusable.", "INFO: respectfully asking, how old are you???", "YTA. Outside food is outside food and dressing counts.\n\nAnd saying the restaurant wasn't \"normal\" for not having ranch makes you sound kinda xenophobic and completely immature.", "YTA - this is a repeat story from a few months back.", "You did Michael a HUGE favour by showing him what a selfish, unadventurous, incurious, and downright rude person you are on only the third date. You aren't going to be hearing from him again, and he's always going to have the \"worst date\" story at any gathering.\n\nYou couldn't go a single meal without a favourite condiment that most restaurants don't carry, and rather than trying something new, you wail that traditional dishes \"weren't the same\" without your beloved ranch sauce, you go out and purchase some, then argue with the waiter over them not carrying your niche condiment that doesn't go with the cuisine. Of course they weren't the same, different food is supposed to taste different. You're effectively saying that no food in the world could possibly be any good or worth eating without ranch sauce, of all things.\n\nYTA, and what a stupid thing to be an AH over.", "YTA\n\nThis is extremely embarrassing, immature, and rude behavior. The fact that it was ranch dressing turned the situation from an embarrassing gaffe to an awful American stereotype. \n\nIt is very probable that this guy won't want to see you again.

You saved him a lot of time. Oh also, YTA.", "You seem to be genuinely struggling to understand this: when you go to a sit-down restaurant where you are served, **you are not at home**. You eat the food however the restaurant serves it, with the utensils and condiments the restaurant serves. If you want to act like you're at home and put ranch on everything, **stay home.** Leaving your date to purchase ranch dressing and then bring it into the restaurant was beyond unclassy. You aren't a child, so why act like one?\n\nAdults eat what is available at the restaurant when they go. They don't leave mid-meal to get extra condiments from the store.

Please tell me you're like... 14 or something. \n\nYTA.", "OP, I get it...I adore ranch with a few things ( pizza, breadsticks, fries, strangely salad not one of them) but I can still enjoy them without it. Your date was treating you to an amazing ethnic  dining experience. Did you have to insist on the Ranch? Many restaurants ( and chefs) really take offense to that kind of thing.

Pretty sure that was your last date with Michael.  Have you ever been screened for an eating disorder/autism?", "YTA - I can be a picky eater, but I  can find something to eat at every restaurant.

No, you left your fucking date, to buy ranch??", "YTA.  How old are you anyway?  Very few things you don't eat with Ranch?  He ordered a sampler so that you could taste what a new cuisine had to offer and you just wanted to smother it in Ranch to cover the taste?  I wouldn't go out with you again either.  That's a really childish thing to do and isn't any better than some people who won't eat anything but chicken nuggets, french fries, and pizza.  Really a turn off when an adult has childish eating habits.", "YTA. Look, I love ranch too. Probably not to the extent you do, but I put it on a lot of food, including pizza. What I have never done, however, is bring in a bottle of ranch when a restaurant didn't have any. Yes, a bottle of hidden valley or whatever counts as outside food, as it should. This was incredibly tacky. Please don't ever do this again.", "YTA. What you did was really inappropriate for both a restaurant as well as a date, but you're free to be weird if you want. Just don't think your date was in the wrong, because what you did would make most people embarrassed and uncomfortable (especially arguing with the restaurant staff when you DID bring in outside food). Next time, wait until you know somebody better before you start forcing them into these kinds of social interactions.", "YTA. That\u2019s your last date with Michael btw because of your childlike palate and your terrible table manners.", "YTA. It\u2019s so unfortunate, too, because Michael was clearly excited about sharing something with you that he really liked. Yet you insisted on dumping [big globs of gross ranch dressing] all over the experience.\n\nWhy couldn\u2019t you have just been polite?", "YTA. I notice you didn\u2019t mention your age, so I\u2019ll assume you\u2019re like 17.

Escaped early from further humiliation with a great story about the one you got away from. \n\nOP, YTA.", "YTA. You disrespected the restaurant and your date by going to buy ranch. You have no manners, whatever if you think it was perfectly acceptable to do this. Michael definitely deleted your number once he got in his car.", "How old are you? Like 12?

Pretty sure you don\u2019t have to worry about another date.", "YTA \n\nI love spicy food but live where Tabasco is considered spicy....I consider it water. So I have a SMALL TRAVEL SIZED hot sauce bottle I bring with me, it could fit in my pocket. Because I know I need this to taste most bland ass food.... That being said, if I forgot it (happens often) I would never be dense enough to leave the restaurant in the middle of dinner, to bring in a whole ass bottle of sauce, and then argue with the staff about it, because yes, it is outside food and a large item. So, Id just go one meal without. Because I'm an adult who can suck it up for one meal. It's not like the food was bad, you just like ranch...but like.... you really are gonna need to learn to eat without it at some point, not everywhere has ranch and it's kinda silly to expect it with every meal.", "YTA.\n\nYou're acted like a child. MOST restaurants don't allow outside food, and that includes salad dressing and drinks. And you insulted the restaurant by implying that their dressing wasn't good enough for you.", "This reads like a very bad fanfic of an AITA post.", "YTA. This would be insulting to the restaurant for one thing. You also compare it to \u201cnormal restaurants,\u201d which sounds racist. The fact you couldn\u2019t go without it is too much. It\u2019s similar to people who salt food before even tasting it. You had to leave your date to get dressing. This is one of the weirder obsessions I\u2019ve seen. Sure, it\u2019s just dressing, but why is it that important to you? Would you leave a country you were vacationing in if you realized they don\u2019t have ranch everywhere? Would you pack ranch in your suitcase?", "YTA because you left a restauraumt in the middle of a date because they dodnt have the specific condimemt your addicted to. BTW what did you mean by ranch being in normal Restaurants. Are you saying that because a POLISH/HUNGARIAN restaurant didnt have american condiments its somehow at fault?", "I implore you to leave behind whatever land-locked state ideas and attitudes you have about other cultures cuisines behind.

Ex: I watched her sit down with a head of lettuce and a big bottle of Heinz and finish them both at the same time.

He had to have been mortified when you left and came back with a freaking bottle of it. \n\nYTA, and I suggest that you never go out to eat at a decent restaurant again.

Don't bother going to any restaurants that aren't crappy chains since you don't seem to enjoy the taste of food.", "That is just so hilariously cringe. Even if it wasn\u2019t an asshole move (which it was), it would be enough for most sensible people to walk out of a date with you.

He took you to his favorite restaurant and you embarrassed him by acting like a child who cannot self regulate and understand that you don\u2019t get everything you want all the time. I don\u2019t think you realize how insulting it was to leave to get the ranch. You told Michael and the staff that you found the food inedible without ranch, and that you didn\u2019t have basic manners to stay and eat the food that was prepared for you while still hot.  You won\u2019t see Michael again.  It\u2019s not about the ranch, it\u2019s about your shockingly childish behaviour.", "Oh, come on.\n\nI'm surprised you're not complaining about the lack of chickie nuggies on the kids menu. Grow up.

What I\u2019m struggling to get is, why didn\u2019t you try the sour cream and dill? It would have complimented the food better, not ended in disaster, and it would\u2019ve satisfied your craving for ranch. The fact that you couldn\u2019t even make do with what they had on hand is alarmingly childish. \n\nIn the words of Ron Weasley, you *need* to sort out your priorities.", "You USA citziens can be so weird sometimes. There's plenty of food that is not served with ranch, and adding ranch to it... well... Just ruins it.\n\nYTA.

For starters, Polish/Hungarian food is normal. It\u2019s okay that you really enjoy ranch but having to have it on everything is imo too much. You will never learn to enjoy good without it as long as you keep putting it on everything. You probably did embarrass a Michael. And you kind of unintentionally disrespected the restaurant.

It was our third date and he took me to one of his favorite restaurants. It was a hole-in-the-wall Polish/Hungarian place. We ordered our food and he ordered a sampler plate so I could try different things. There's very few things I don't eat with ranch, I just like it and helps make some things easier to eat so I always have it with my meals. When we got our food, I asked for some ranch. The waiter said they didn't have any and offered to bring out some kind of sour cream and dill sauces. I tried them and they just weren't the same. I told Michael I'd be right back, took my wallet and left the restaurant. I had seen a convenience store close by when arriving so I went, bought a bottle of ranch, and came back. \n\nMichael looked shocked but didn't say anything and ate his food. The food was great and we got some conversation going when the waiter came over and said outside food wasn't allowed. I said dressing isn't outside food and they didn't have what I needed to enjoy my meal. I didn't want to ruin the evening so I took it out to my car and returned. When we finished and left, Michael thanked me for coming out with him but said it was really offputting that I had to leave and go buy a bottle of dressing instead of just going one meal without it. I told him I wouldn't have had to do that if they had had ranch or any dressings like a normal restaurant. He didn't walk me to my car or anything and just left. I went home and told my roommate about my date and his attitude and she asked me if I was being serious. She thinks I had bad etiquette and embarrassed Michael to the point he was probably going to stop talking to me. I don't think what I did was really all that bad, it was a condiment, not an entire meal from someplace. Was I wrong for what I did?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Try it; you might like it!  \ud83d\ude0a\n\nBut I would never do what this OP did!", "They include [this kind of dipping sauce](https://www.britishcornershop.co.uk/product.asp?id=21799&curr=usd&gsrc=shopping&ccode=US&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIjb_D65eM_gIV8f_jBx2Dig9NEAQYASABEgK3P_D_BwE) with pizza in the UK. I loved it when I was there to dip the crust in but unfortunately you can\u2019t find it in the US. At least not easily. My (sad) substitute is ranch.\n\nAlso a bacon chicken ranch pizza is fantastic.", "IT\u2019S NOT ABOUT THE IRANIAN YOGURT!", "I feel like the word ranch hit semantic satiation in record time in this post. Rrrrrrrrraaaaaaaannnnccccchhhh", "I remember that post", "The essence of tomato would be better than ketchup!", "No, you don't have to be socially unaware to do this. You just have to not give a damn about the rules. I was born a woman, so don't tell me how autism is different in females than males. She isn't autistic.", "As an autistic person, this doesn't read like someone on the spectrum on me. It reads more like someone not making an effort to understand social etiquette. \n\nI mean, I could be wrong. But it honestly doesn't come across like she's on the spectrum. Just coddled and ignorant", "Im also autistic, level 2 specifically. Maybe don't suggest to strangers on the internet that they look into autism when you don't have enough of the story. Look at her comments. She's a raging racist.", "OF COURSE ITS NOT BECAUSE YOGURT SND SOUR CREAM ARE NOT RANCH", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/tmxe42/aita_for_being_mad_my_bf_wont_make_noodles_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nEnjoy!  I hope that works.", "I understand how shitty it can be online and irl to be autistic, and the amount of progress that still needs to be made in society but I don't agree that what I said is hurting the autistic community. Once again, I do not think that ASD would excuse her behaviour or make it acceptable. Gatekeeping autism, and limiting who should or shouldn't be offered resources doesn't help anyone. Yes she's racist, yes she's an ass. But in that one in a billion chance that she (or anyone reading it) may find any value in what I said, then I stand by it. \n\nAlso as I said before, part of the reason I suggested her doing research was so that she has an opportunity to slow down, reflect on her behaviour and words. People are crap at self reflection generally, and that would be one way to get her to look back on what she did wrong in a roundabout way (as if you told someone to do some self reflection directly, they likely couldn't/wouldn't). Doing any research will hopefully mean she is  then reflecting back, to see her actions in a different light and learn from it and make things right/apologise with true understanding (not just a false apology). I know I haven't explained the last part very well, I can't think of better words to put it in", "I WILL NEVER JEOPARDISE THE RANCH", "If she's not willing to not be racist what makes you think she's going to be okay with you suggesting she's disabled? All you're doing is giving her an excuse to use from now on when she doesn't show signs of autism. You're hurting the community."]}
