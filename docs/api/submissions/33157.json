This doesn't mean I'm implying that they walk around naked, but there's generally less stigma around the topic. I've also lived throughout the UK and spent years traveling around a lot of Europe, so I'm not speaking from a place of ignorance despite being American born myself.", "You sound insecure about being European? Like you thinking that THEY think that is on you. You just want someone to agree with you.", "I don\u2019t think you fully understand pedant babes. Also! I said it was culturally relevant not excused! Guter Tag \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea", "In Germany IIRC you're not allowed to sauna with clothes/bathing suit in a lot of places.", "Maybe you should have replied to what they wrote instead of the unrelated broad generalization that you wanted to complain about.", "you mean, there are reasonable limits for what is reasonable to feel uncomfortable about for you, not to everyone.  \n\n\nedit: sentence structure.", "whether or not this is how saunas work in germany is completely irrelevant. if your partner is uncomfortable with you being naked in front of people, then that is the end of the conversation. \n\nthere is no way to rationalize it with cultures or customs as this is a deal breaker for that person. the only thing you can change here is whether or not you stay in a relationship with that person. imo not being naked in front of other people is an easy compromise. as another commenter has put it, it would be a pretty stupid hill to die on.", "who is you? i personally don't have an issue with any of this. but i see why some people may take issue. i don't see anyone in here arguing that it's unacceptable, just that it's not an unreasonable point of contention for a relationship, regardless of cultural norms. \n\npeople are brought up to view nudity differently even within the same culture, this isn't a secret, and i don't think it's controlling to ask your SO not to be naked in front of other people, especially women.", "Only answer right here.", "I hear that. But I don't know. Not being naked around others isn't a craaaaaaazy boundary. Certainly not in the category of not being around those of a different ethnicity.", "I blame the media. The violence is what sells so every day you see the same thing a shooting or something else and it comes to a point where you get desensitized to it. \n\nI stopped using 90% of social media as that's all that it would show and it just made my heart hurt. \n\nWould love one day to move out of here but for now I just avoid it as best I can.", "Yeah they do. I'm not coming from chernobyl. Pretty easy to clean and wash away fresh sweat.", "What does that even mean? Multiple people in this thread have said that they DO think Europeand generally are not that prudish etc., and I am just saying from my own experience being from Europe, that's not really the case.", "Sure, and I think in general people would agree as well, that the naked body is, for a lot of people, a big deal", "It may be a deal breaker, but you have it backwards. If you live in a culture where this is normal, and your partner is upset about you participating in a standard, non sexual, non cheating activity, it\u2019s time to get rid of that partner, for being paranoid and controlling.  It\u2019s no different than an American guy demanding his gf not wear crop tops in public.", "The culture is very relevant to whether a compromise is an easy compromise, or even a practical compromise.\n\nIf you are in a culture where being naked in front of family and friends is something you almost never do, of course it's going to be a easy compromise. Most people will make that compromise and expect others to. \n\nIf you are in a culture where people usually go to saunas naked, and your family and existing friends all enjoy it, and you enjoy it, that's a very different story.\n\nImagine if the dealbreader was *\"my partner is uncomfortable with me being in a room alone with an unrelated member of the opposite sex\"*. That's a normal and practical thing in some countries.\n\n'naked in a sauna' in some countries is probably closer to 'bikini in a pool' in America. Yeah, if you don't want your partner wearing a bikini in front of other people, their only option is to decide if they stay or leave. But that doesn't change the fact that the thing you consider a dealbreaker is considered socially acceptable in your culture. If you lived in Saudi Arabia though... That would be a very different story.", "Don\u2019t practice your cultural customs because they are weird is well on the way to not being around those of different ethnicities.  It\u2019s a rejection of a harmless part of their culture.", "It\u2019s not crazy. This incident can be chalked up to a miscommunication. But the girlfriend is more than allowed to say \u201cI will breakup with you if you continue going to naked saunas when you know that makes me uncomfortable.\u201d It\u2019s not even like OP is only seeing strangers he will never see again, he is going with people he typically sees in a non nude setting. And judging from the post, it doesn\u2019t even sound like OP and gf even live in Germany.", "You get clean enough for most purposes, but not for saunas. Chlorine for example does not wash off with just water, it requires soap, and is one of the things your sauna bench mates don't want to inhale.\n\nMost saunas have a no swimwear rule and it's for a reason. Be considerate to others or stick with just taking a hot shower.", "yeah and for some cultures and people it isn't which is exactly what OP said...", "i swear to god most redditors have never been in relationships. this is so exhausting to read.", "Not \"because they're weird\" but because they massively overlap with completely run of the mill taboos of my culture.", "You dont use soap in the shower?\n\nMost saunas where I grew up dont have that rule. In fact, they dont allow full nudity. So as I said, it's cultural. Dont tell me the only way to use a sauna is to get completely naked. You should be considerate as well. There are different ways to do one thing.", "Huh.  I\u2019ve been married for 35 years."]}
