If it mirrors the OP's scenario, she didn't tell me right away, but wasn't trying to hide it.\n\nSo...\n\nWe're fucking adults. Nudity isn't a big deal, we are not still embarrassed by butts and boobs. It's called trusting your partner.\n\nIf you're asking me if I trust her enough to be naked around a guy without somehow ending up on top of him, the answer is yes. Grow up.", "He was in Germany. It's the culture there. So, some education and insight was missed. That shouldn't be held against someone else. But, that seems to be the norm these days. Those who lack understanding blaming others.", "For me there would be a lot of mental gymnastics to think my nudity is inappropriate where I\u2019m comfortable bc my partner thinks they own my nudity. I like being comfortable with my body", "relationships are about compromise, but I think if you're the prude you should probably be doing some soul searching as to why. all of us who're comfortable with our bodies and being naked in non sexual contexts already know  the reasons why someone might be prudish but it's refreshing when someone who is actually tries to see the other side instead of just demanding someone to stop doing something that they've likely done all their lives.\n\npersonally I have way fewer body issues than most women my age and I credit it to taking saunas from a young age, you see bodies of all kinds and it's pretty reassuring to know that they're all normal and don't need to be hidden away.\n\nETA: and you know what? I know people who grow up in sauna cultures who don't like visiting them too. the difference is they just don't go themselves instead of demanding everyone else around them stop.", "I don't think women controlling anyone is any better than a man doing it.\n\nThe issue here has been mostly those going on and on about their own feelings about nudity. Seems everyone here has been to Norway et al.\n\nAnd drop the hyperbole she didn't tell him he couldn't, she said and I quote \"She didn't think I should\"...Didn;t see a \"You can't\" anywhere in there so I am not sure why you're trying  reach on this, but it wasn't a good one.", "Another question for ya. If the Sauna closes down would that be cultural erasure? I went to a Sauna a week ago. Was I culturally appropriating German culture?! I\u2019m really trying to figure this shit out.", "How tf is going to a fucking Sauna a part of someone\u2019s culture? Does the whole world suddenly not have Saunas? Are they exclusive to Germany?! How tf do you even have 13 likes??", "This whole thread insulting people for not being ok with nudity is creepy as fuck.", "Yes, and you're correct about that. I was just saying that it also doesn't make OP NTA. It maybe makes him less of an asshole than if he was from NA, but the bottom line here isn't how acceptable nudity is, it's communication with his partner and respecting her feelings imo. I feel like he knew she wouldn't like it and did it anyway.", "I heard their babies are even born naked!!!111", "You communicate and draw the line wherever you're comfortable drawing the line. If you find her line to controlling, then you shouldn't be with her. It's not about telling someone their line is wrong, it's about communication and respecting your partner.", "Not everywhere. There are plenty of unisex onsen. And nudity is still much, MUCH more common and less sexualized.\n\nSource: Grew up in Japan.", "I feel like the people who are stressed about no sexual nudity around family are just self reporting that they don\u2019t trust their partner and also have weird ideas about what their partner will do with their cousins", "There\u2019s nothing unreasonable about being comfortable nude either. It\u2019s also perfectly reasonable to disagree with your SO banning you from going into a sauna with family. In the end it\u2019s about wether either can compromise and if not then they just aren\u2019t compatible. Neither has a moral high ground", "Not quite. There are very few male only saunas in Germany. And those who are are often places for homosexual men to meet. On the other hand many saunas offer one single day a week for women only. So no, its not just a \"small ask\" if he enjoys going to saunas. There is a whole chain of issues attached to it.\n\nFurthermore it takes two to tango. It may not be an unreasonable ask to you or the GF. But what if it is to him? His point of view matters as much as hers. Which is why this needs to be discussed by two adults. She cant just say \"this is kinda gross, dont do that\". BOTH got to communicate why / why not and express themselves.\n\nPersonally as a german I've dated women before who come from a way more culturally conservative background. And the topic of saunas actually comes up because of the big gap of perspectve of life. A common difference is the perspective on nudity. For my exes it was an issue of associating adult nudity with sexuality within their culture (hands conservative and modest clothing). To me it is not. I can see a naked body and not think anything relating to sexuality, because I've grown up in the context of naked bodies not being necessarily sexual. Doesn't mean I don't understand her perspective. But she also needs to understand my perspective. Else you can't find a common ground with a partner. Same applies to OPs situation. \"Dont do that\" is not a functional communication strategy.", "It\u2019s not the sauna.  It\u2019s imposing your social mores on others.  It\u2019s culturally acceptable to be nude in a sauna in Germany.  If you are imposing American Puritanism on people from Europe you are probably the asshole.  Its like objecting to kissing as a greeting", "What?? \n\nI\u2019d immediately end this relationship. This is too weird for me.", "Hahahahaha, why assume I'm a guy? If op was my partner i woulda told him to stay at the spa and not come back, i don't give a rats ass if you think im creepy, as i said it may be acceptable in that Country...\nBut I've NEVER met a woman who would be accepting of that scenario... so you can STFU!!", "Yea, like I get that some of you might be ok with it, but why are you trying to say that I am weird for having my comfort zone where it is. This sub seems to want to say \u201cset your boundaries and keep them there\u201d while also saying \u201cyour boundaries are stupid and you need to conform to my idea of what is right for you\u201d. \n\nIt is very creepy that people who strive for boundaries are so happy to stomp them down for the simplest things. Like what is the point of setting boundaries if they are just going to be blatantly disregarded. \n\nThe cultural things that people set boundaries up with are usually their for a good reason to THEM because they grew up in a culture that not only had that but others things that built a good structure for them. \n\nHaving to justify why your boundaries are there for random people on the internet and have them berate you on why they are wrong seems to go against the whole point of the thing.", "I'm in America and the sauna at my gym is bathing suit mandatory \ud83e\udd37 I know there are full naked saunas around but not unheard of to chill in a suite", "Agree to an extent. You cannot assume that he thought that because if that was the case why would he have told her? I agree the issue is communication but using your own words for this argument. The girlfriend is also presumably German and knows that nudist saunas exist and are frequented\u2026so she should\u2019ve laid out this boundary when she knew they were going on vacation or something. Not arguing with you at all just saying the other side of the coin is that GF could\u2019ve spoke up before if she\u2019s also German and used to this culturally ;)", "I\u2019m german and i go to Hohwacht (a GERMAN beach) all the time. i promise you that topless/nude sunbathing has not dramatically decreased over there. it is not sexualized here as in the states.", "> If you find her line to controlling, then you shouldn't be with her. \n\nI guarantee you if the doctor example was put as a post on this subreddit as the nude person was the woman. The man would be considered controlling and abusive.", "Completely unrelated to OP, but it's there any trick to look for a unisex onsen? My husband and I would like to be able to go to an onsen together next time we visit. If it helps, I speak (and can read slowly) a bit of Japanese... Are there any specific terms I should look for?", "Not in many countries", "i never implied there was anything unreasonable about being comfortable nude tho. my comment was in relation to the many commenters here that apparently cannot fathom why OP's SO would be uncomfortable about this. this is the part that is insane to me, and indicates how out of touch the average redditor is.", "I now feel sorry for you. Being casually naked around family is my normal, and widely normal here, like going from bathroom to bedroom at night. Why on earth would you cover up to go pee in the middle of the night? And if you run into someone else, no fucking biggie!( Unless you LITERALLY run into them, in which case you would most likely have a slightly uncomfortable laugh about it)", "Not going to a sauna is not a big ask. Rent a private one if you have to go to a sauna.", "But isn\u2019t demanding his girlfriend to throw away her boundaries also forcing \u201csocial mores\u201d on her? Look, I get what you are saying, and I definitely don\u2019t think he\u2019s the asshole here. But acting like cultural incompatibility isn\u2019t a perfectly reasonable thing to end a relationship over is stupid. He isn\u2019t wrong for doing what he is comfortable with and she isn\u2019t wrong for breaking up over it.

In that perspective it generally is less prudish.", "Not really, you aren't \"not seeking medical care\", you are just going to a different doctor. \n\nThere are plenty of perfectly good female Gynos. My mother is one. Hell, 82% of upcoming gynos are women, so it's not even a difficult ask.
