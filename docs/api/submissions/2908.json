It seems like you had a job and were supporting yourself UNTIL she said she wanted to travel for her job. Now of course, she\u2019s absolutely free to do that, but she cannot expect you to go into debt while the rent is already being covered by the company. If I\u2019m not wrong, the rent is going to be the same whether it\u2019s just her living there or both of you. So why exactly does she need you to pay? It\u2019s not like _she\u2019s_ paying?", "NTA and it\u2019s ridiculous for her to ask you to uproot your life whilst providing you with no financial stability when it\u2019s easily accessible to her.", "NAH\n\nYou can\u2019t afford to travel with her right now.

She could go by herself and you can always join her when you find the kind of job you need.", "NTA. She\u2019s asking you to make a big sacrifice by leaving your job, so I think it\u2019s fair that you ask her to cover rent while you search for a job (since you\u2019d be moving for her).

So you paid for at least a portion of the rent with money you didn\u2019t have, creating debt?\n\nDo I understand that correctly?", "NTA.

Of course, I don\u2019t know how long you\u2019ve been together but I see so many couples on AITA clearly not understanding the concept of a partnership, which is what a relationship is.

At the end of the day, though, yall just aren't compatible as roommates like this. \n\nTo continue this relationship you both need your own high-paying travel jobs.

I read this post a couple of times, but for the life of me I never saw in the post where OP\u2019s girlfriend explicitly or implicitly said OP would have to quit his job.  OP said he\u2019d \u201cbe down for that\u201d when GF said she wanted to go back to travel nursing.  \u201cDown with that,\u201d in my mind means it would be OP\u2019s decision to quit his job.  My wife\u2019s a nurse and we know lots of nurses who did/do that travel nurse thing.  OP is well within his right to ask GF to cover rent, but it seems there is a breakdown in priorities within the relationship if GF is willing to pack up to travel with or without OP.
