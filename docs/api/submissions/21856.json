Your sister and niece pulled an ugly, mean-girl, spiteful, jealous, excluding move, and all you rest of the family followed them like sheep. Even worse, you defend it rather than see it for what it is.\n\nAnd even if you think Everly is random, your brother is your family. You could have supported her for him.", "I feel like that makes the difference. If OP accepted the invitation then bailed then he is an asshole for sure. If he said, \"Hey I am already going to a party that day\" then he is not.", "Was this your actual uncle or the brother of the man your mom had recently married?", "You UNCLE not STEP-UNCLE\n\nI'm not going to take a teengae girl who is not related to me out. Of course I spend time with my bio niblings", "I swear if I made a post asking if I'm the asshole for taking my brother's new stepdaughter to a restaurant alone you'd all call me a creep so cut the crap", ">Was this your actual uncle or the brother of the man your mom had recently married?\n\nDoes it matter if this specific example was my mother's brother, my dad's university roommate, my grandfather's half-sister's daughter's husband, my aunt's new husband, or one of the other numerous people in our chosen extended 'family'... who have varying levels of new vs dating back centuries - and close blood vs completely genetically dissimilar... who I called my 'uncle'?\n\nWhat matters is that the relationship was familial - not pornographic - and there was nothing creepy about it because those involved weren't and aren't creeps!\n\nThere are, of course, activities to lean towards &/or away from depending on the relationship - and doing things 1 on 1 is likely not a wise choice... but again - it's not creepy unless OP is a creep - which... it seems OP is a creep... so that's a separate issue that emphasizes and solidifies their AH Status.", ">I'm not going to take a teengae girl who is not related to me out. \n\nyou're missing the point - she \\*IS\\* related to you! This isn't the plot to a porn-hub movie... and the fact that you are trying to reinforces my statement that doing activities with your family isn't creepy - but you sexualizing this young woman is.\n\nAlso - be aware - I have \\*LOTS\\* of \"uncles\" and \"Aunts\" - many of whom have no biological link to me... like my Uncle Piotr who is my grandfather's half sister's daughter's husband... technically half-first-cousin once-removed's husband... but; he's family. He's my Uncle. Much simpler designation.\n\nThere's also my 'niece' who calls my mom \"granny\" and me \"Uncle\" despite there being no biological link between us - just close family friendship for the last 20 years. She's still my niece - and there would be nothing creepy about me taking her to an activity - because I'm not a creep.\n\nSo I repeat:\n\nStop being a perverted creep, and an AH! Do better.", "That wouldn't be creepy at all. It's normal for family to do things together, and despite how resistant you seem to be towards it, she *is* your family. You're the only one who's making it weird.", "Would you take your other niece to dinner - alone?  I think its creepy you think its creepy. She is 15. and now your niece. If you think it would be uncomfortable then maybe take both nieces but there is a big difference between creepy and uncomfortable.", "It matters quite a bit if this was someone you had known your whole life or someone you had only recently met and didn\u2019t have a close bond with.", "Like it's scary how ill adjusted OP is. At this stage he probably shouldn't spend time alone with her. He's giving off fucked up vibes."]}
