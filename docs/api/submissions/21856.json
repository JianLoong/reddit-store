Yes. \n\nIs he an asshole for not loving a stranger or considering her to BE a stranger? NO. He should have said it nicer, but the facts are that she IS a stranger to him, that he\u2019s known barely a few months, and NO he can not LOVE her already. That cheapens the word love. Stop it guys. \n\nThe issue isn\u2019t that he doesn\u2019t love her. He SHOULDNT. The issue is he isn\u2019t being polite or respectful, something he should be acting to anyone but especially children in the broader family.", "Doubly so because in another thread higher up he keeps referring to him interacting with the step-child in any way, shape, or form as some precursor to him trying to molest her.  Dude is an unhinged asshole", "The whole family obviously hates the step niece and new wife", "Except your situation should be the norm. So many parents can\u2019t coparent. But being amicable with your coparent and their spouse makes the kids life so much better and happier. Plus you only get so many holidays. There\u2019s only like 10 times to be Santa Claus and parents should understand that they don\u2019t have unlimited time.", "Totally agree with you. And weekend has 2 days! They could just ask Sophie / her parents to make party next day in order to welcome Everly to the family.", "Me, too. It\u2019s cruel. And then thinking about Everly - how awful it must be for your mom to have married a man with a cruel family.", "It probably that op doesn't agree with the parent's marriage bc of the additional child... reaaally sad. The comments keep getting worse.\n\nYta op. Yta", "Does OP have a partner? \n\nI'm almost wondering if the 'favourte toy' of OP was new wife (Or at least in his thoughts) and he's taking the marriage of brother out on the stepniece", "I pretty much went NC with the majority of my family. It has been so freeing not dealing with the toxic slug every day.", "It\u2019s even worse if they\u2019re in the US, where almost everyone had a long weekend to celebrate the 4th of July. Under normal circumstances, a Sunday party might be less ideal bc people have work the next day. But this particular weekend almost no one had work the next day bc of the long weekend! In fact I had Monday and Tuesday off too, which made Monday basically a weekend day too", "Y\u2019all wil treat Sofie like this and wonder later why she is spoiled and acts entitled all the time. Your whole family is failing two girls.", "You realize you can care and love more than one person right? You sound bitter at the potential of Sophie of having to share attention with family at all. Get help. You need it.", "then why tf did you post here? makes no sense ahahah", "If they're anything like you, they're all assholes.", "Not one person is calling you an asshole for loving and adoring Sophie. Don\u2019t be so dense.", "I want to call you more than AH so bad, but I have to remain civil.\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude43", "I guess you all would also be fine is Sophie would bully Everly horribly. Because thats the attitude you have", ">\\[who was just integrated into the family like last week\\]\n\nI assume OP knew her longer than that. I find the whole \"stepkids aren't family until the wedding happens\" to have a bit of a sour aftertaste tbh.\n\nThe rest is spot on though.", "It is so much the tone of his comments. Some of them give a strong impression that it didn't really matter what the other items on his social calendar were, they were going to come ahead of anything having to do with his brother's new family.\n\nI have no sympathy for OP and every sympathy for his brother and new family.\n\nA couple of years ago, my BIL married a lady with a daughter who's now a tween. Are they my favorite people in the world? No. Drama is practically a way of life for SIL and step-niece is getting there. But we embraced them as family from day one.\n\nMy spouse and I (and our kids) live a long enough distance away from them that this sort of schedule conflict is unlikely to be an issue. But if it should ever pop up, we'll certainly deal with it a lot more maturely than OP here is displaying.", "Totally OP is an ass with his commentary\nBut in a nice way, I would go to my nieces party who I have a long-standing relationship with, but I wouldn\u2019t talk shit about Everly. Poor ev!", "Great explanation from, oh, wait\u2026", "I guess but let\u2019s just be honest and forget about op nasty attitude. It is his Step niece. The relationship isn\u2019t there like it is with the other niece he\u2019s known her entire life that\u2019s my point. It was shitty to have both on the same day everybody fucked up.", ">it takes time to form relationships.\n\nIt's safe to assume that it won't happen here because OP is unwilling to make time for \"some random girl.\"\n\nWhat an AH\n\n(I originally went with something worse than AH, but I don't want to get banned.)\n\nAlso of note, OP supposedly accepts this verdict, but apparently does not want to demonstrate accountability. They could make an effort to do something with the brother's new family, centered around the neglected birthday girl.\n\nI can't imagine realizing that I had been so awful to a child and shrugging it off. Heartless.", "It takes time to develop relationships, but it didn't take long for the family to destroy any chance of that.  Why should the stepdaughter plan to have her birthday party on a day that isn't her birthday?  The whole family except the brother are AH", ">Everyone saying that the family has to accept the stepdaughter ignores that it takes time to form relationships.\n\nI don't think they have to worry about forming relationships if they don't put an iota of effort in.", "NGL I\u2019m over here thanking my lucky stars you are not my family", "Troll alert. \ud83e\udd73", "Your family doesn\u2019t give two shits about HER. The commenter didn\u2019t say the other way around.", "Yeah then there\u2019s absolutely no excuse if it\u2019s THAT weekend. Even if it was a normal weekend, if it was a Sunday party, it could start at noon and end at like 6 and that\u2019s a long enough party.", "I don\u2019t understand why they are trying to throw a \u2018party\u2019 for the poor girl. Does she really want to hang around with her stepfather\u2019s disinterested brother for her birthday?", "This!! I love when they ask if they're the AH and then get mad when people are like.. yes, yes you are!!!!!! Sounds like OP and FAM are pretty immature and petty and that this might have been done on purpose. Poor kid didn't asked to join this awful family.", "Sounds like it was on purpose", "Id work with my family to split up and make sure the newest addition felt welcome. But my family tries to lead with kindness and inclusion, it\u2019s an odd concept for most I know", "My birthday is mid December and for a few years when I was a kid I actually held my birthday party in the summer because it was easier for people to come to it! Birthday parties really don\u2019t need to be so close to the actual birthday at all", "Ok. I disagree with your assessment but you\u2019re certainly entitled to it.", "I think there is a jealousy or groundless hatred of the wife/step niece going on here. It doesn\u2019t make sense for OP to have this level of meanness towards a \u201cstranger.\u201d Or maybe the whole thing is made up, who knows?", "I'll be honest. I wouldn't have much of a relationship with my step niece who I've known for a couple of months. I would still come even if I didn't know her.\n\nOP would probably got to a party with her friends and friends of her friends and friends of the friends of her friends..Even though there are strangers to her,  they are friends of other friends that know her. It's the same thing with Everly. While she may be a stranger to you, you still have your brother with you (assuming you are the only one). OP's brother probably invited other family members so of they came, OP could talk to them.", "Sophie's father wasn't available on the next weekend so there was a reason for them throwing party earlier. However, weekend has 2 days so they could had organised Sophie's party on other day that did not clash with Everly's party.", "  \nAt least drop off a present after the party.", "No not at all. I\u2019m a nice person too! i would feel really bad. Honestly if I were this person I would try to hit up the other one just for like an hour and bring her a little gift and then go to Sophie\u2019s.", "Wow, I never got to celebrate within a month of my birthday as it's in summer and no one was ever available when I was a kid. It sucked. Usually had parties ~6 weeks before, and no school celebration, ever. Now I just make plans with myself most years so I'm not disappointed by the lack of people to celebrate with.", "Just based on how OP calls her his brother's wife's kid, he clearly doesn't see her as family & I don't think the rest of them do after his edit.", "My teenage step nephew lives with me. I treat him exactly the same as I treat his brother, who is my bio nephew. \n\nYou are so much the asshole. Hopefully they will find better family.", "I take out my step-nephew all the time because I care about him and want him to know that. \n\nThe fact you are differentiating between step family and bio family makes you an asshole", "(1) literally no one would lol\n\n(2) who even said it had to be a restaurant?? Bowling, movies, mini golf, park, bookstore, etc etc\u2014and don\u2019t you have family? If you\u2019re so worried abt being a creep plan something with her and another sibling", "I mean yeah at this point I would because you can\u2019t seem to stop sexualizing the poor child", "i mean you seem so focused on so yeah you do sound like.a creep", "Agreed and that's saying a LOT because, well, Reddit...", "I'll be honest. She is sort of a stranger. Kinda like a friend of friend that you don't really know with the common friend between you two is the brother. Her brother and his wife have been married for a couple of months so Everly is fairly new to her stepdad's side of the family. But she does not deserve the meanness and hatred that OP has towards her.", "This is why I think OP is terrible. In two minutes you came up with a solution that would have included the step niece, even if just a bit. It\u2019s his one or the other stance, and acting like Evelyn isn\u2019t important as a human in general, that is grossing me out the most"]}
