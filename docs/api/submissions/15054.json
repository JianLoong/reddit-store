I mostly DJ for just family and friends I\u2019m not really a professional, just do it for a little side cash from time to time. \n\nLast weekend I got invited to DJ on the cheap at a wedding for a friend of a friend. At the wedding while everyone was on the dance floor one of the guests we\u2019ll call him \u201cKevin\u201d approached me and asked if I could play the song \u201cGolden Hour\u201d It was an odd request because at this time all the guests were literally hoping around and dancing but I was told to take all requests so did it anyways. When I started playing it the dance floor started to clear up and then Kevin invited a woman onto the dance floor they started slow dancing for a bit, a few people joined them (including the bride and groom) Then at that one part of the song Kevin got down on one knee and I knew right away that he was going to propose. I didn\u2019t think it was right especially because they were in the middle of the dance floor with all eyes on them and I kinda felt like if this happened I would take the fault because I was the one to put on a romantic song out of nowhere. \n\nSo instead of letting that happened as soon as he pulled out the box I started to play \u201cBOOGIE\u201d and turned up the volume instead. After that Kevin just side-eyed me and got up and everyone else sat down. After that nothing else really happened and the tension was very thick. \n\nAfter the wedding no one really brought it up and I obviously thought that I wasn\u2019t the asshole and the friend that was friends with the bride said that I wasn\u2019t. But then a bunch of the family started to message me. It turns out that Kevin was the bride\u2019s brother and the family kept asking why I did that, I told them that proposing at someone else\u2019s wedding was not appropriate. They told me that I shouldn\u2019t have an opinion because I was just the DJ and now Kevin got publicly humiliated because some people knew this was going to happen so they were taking videos and live on Instagram so all their friends could see. I responded with \u201cthat would\u2019ve made the newly weds hurt\u201d but then they came back with \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have assumed that the bride didn\u2019t want that.\u201d \n\nThat part got me thinking because I was mostly communicating with the bride about arrangements and she was very chatty before the wedding but after that she kept give my me one word answers. So I assume she is mad at me but then again when she payed me she almost doubled the amount for what I was asking for with a generous tip? So im not sure if the bride actually knew I think she would\u2019ve told me.\n\n\nBut Aita for just assuming?\n\n\n\nETA: A lot of people said to ask the bride and groom I did but like I said their answers were vague. Bride said it was fine but it was probably just to spare my feelings. I didn\u2019t want to push because she clearly had a lot on her mind in the moment.", "created_utc": 1681764548, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pw8zf/aita_for_ruining_a_proposal_at_a_wedding/", "score": 8192, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How are you supposed to know if it was planned? If the bride knew? If the bride was okay with it? If the groom was okay with it? Who the guy even is? You know nothing here. All you know is that it\u2019s typically inappropriate to propose at a wedding, and you reacted accordingly.

You don't just hijack somebody elses day!

This was excellent quick thinking and customer service on your part. Consider that the bride is giving you one word answers because her brother just tried to one-up her at her own wedding, her entire family is on his side, and she's dealing with a ridiculous amount of family drama right now when she should be happily packing for her honeymoon and simply doesn't have time or the energy to give you anything more.", "NAH, but if you are going to run into the same circles with these people and you really \"have to know,\" reach out to the bride and say you \"would like to apologize because you have gotten a lot of angry comments about interrupting Kevin's proposal.

I would have been so happy if my DJ looked out for me like that. Thank you for making sure their day stayed special.", "NTA....

Making someone else's special day into his special day is just...rude? Sure some people might be ok with it, but I'd expect the proposer to have asked permission from the married couple first.

Instead they left you to make a judgement call, and I've seen *lots* of DJs at weddings change the song when things are going a bit off kilter.\n\nReally, if you'd done nothing and the proposal wasn't planned you'd be blamed for playing the song and letting it happen.

While it's true that proposing at someone else's wedding without permission is generally frowned upon, it wasn't your place as the DJ to interfere with someone else's moment. You should have let the proposal happen and let the bride and groom deal with any potential issues that might have arisen from it. It was not your job to make that decision for them.

I mostly DJ for just family and friends I\u2019m not really a professional, just do it for a little side cash from time to time. \n\nLast weekend I got invited to DJ on the cheap at a wedding for a friend of a friend. At the wedding while everyone was on the dance floor one of the guests we\u2019ll call him \u201cKevin\u201d approached me and asked if I could play the song \u201cGolden Hour\u201d It was an odd request because at this time all the guests were literally hoping around and dancing but I was told to take all requests so did it anyways. When I started playing it the dance floor started to clear up and then Kevin invited a woman onto the dance floor they started slow dancing for a bit, a few people joined them (including the bride and groom) Then at that one part of the song Kevin got down on one knee and I knew right away that he was going to propose. I didn\u2019t think it was right especially because they were in the middle of the dance floor with all eyes on them and I kinda felt like if this happened I would take the fault because I was the one to put on a romantic song out of nowhere. \n\nSo instead of letting that happened as soon as he pulled out the box I started to play \u201cBOOGIE\u201d and turned up the volume instead. After that Kevin just side-eyed me and got up and everyone else sat down. After that nothing else really happened and the tension was very thick. \n\nAfter the wedding no one really brought it up and I obviously thought that I wasn\u2019t the asshole and the friend that was friends with the bride said that I wasn\u2019t. But then a bunch of the family started to message me. It turns out that Kevin was the bride\u2019s brother and the family kept asking why I did that, I told them that proposing at someone else\u2019s wedding was not appropriate. They told me that I shouldn\u2019t have an opinion because I was just the DJ and now Kevin got publicly humiliated because some people knew this was going to happen so they were taking videos and live on Instagram so all their friends could see. I responded with \u201cthat would\u2019ve made the newly weds hurt\u201d but then they came back with \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have assumed that the bride didn\u2019t want that.\u201d \n\nThat part got me thinking because I was mostly communicating with the bride about arrangements and she was very chatty before the wedding but after that she kept give my me one word answers. So I assume she is mad at me but then again when she payed me she almost doubled the amount for what I was asking for with a generous tip? So im not sure if the bride actually knew I think she would\u2019ve told me.\n\n\nBut Aita for just assuming?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I am also a wedding DJ, I do it full time, and you did exactly the right thing in my book. I have a similar reaction if unexpected people, especially particularly intoxicated people get up to give toasts or want to grab the mic later in the night. I get a detailed list of who is speaking and when before the day even arrives, and even in the cases where the bride and groom want to open the floor for other people to say something, if I get one suspect look from the bride and groom when someone goes for a mic, that mic gets cut until it is in the hands of the bride and groom. \n\nIf the bride paid you that generous of a tip she was probably not aware that someone was about to be proposed to and was incredibly grateful that you did what you did to intercept. I\u2019ve had a proposal at a wedding I worked only once, and the bride warned me way beforehand that she was in on it on a phone call and the groom was on the call too. Her maid of honor was going to be in the group for the bouquet toss and she had planned to fake the throw then turn around and run it directly to the maid of honor instead and then cue the proposal. It was cute, and very clearly intentional to everyone in attendance. Proposing at someone else\u2019s wedding is such a taboo that couples will be very open about it to vendors and wedding planners that they\u2019re aware and okay with it happening so no one tries to intercept it, because let me tell you, I think every DJ, photographer, and venue or event coordinator I know personally would have stepped in in whatever way they could if they had been in the same situation.", "NTA.

However it was not your choice to make, and although you had good intentions, taking your job as wedding DJ very seriously. But if up to the family to support or not support someone else doing something that\u2019s considered bad wedding etiquette.

However, he still felt the need to ask my husband if he could take requests because he had gotten a few. Idk why my husband of 2 hours didn't ask me or remember what I said about our playlist being every song meant something special to us... But anyway - he played the first request an 8 minute salsa song and it was our first argument being married.

The DJ could see that.

The whole atmosphere of the reception changed. Everyone was happy, dancing, getting excited. The bride was enjoying the atmosphere and dancing with her friends in the middle of the dance floor. Except, the groomzilla was not happy at all. He didn't know how to relax or dance to that particular music. So, he got the best man to talk to the DJ and resume the groom's playlist - one that suited the groom and wasn't accessible  (to enjoy) to most of those present.

Nothing says thank you like money. \n\nCould she sit there and make a big deal to you with all her family watching? No. Did her brother still mess up her wedding? Yes. Did she have a lot to process? Yes. Was she conflicted with letting him have it and not wanting her day completed ruined?

You should've been informed about this.", "NTA. Thanks for being a professional and a kind person in this world. You were right to want clear approval from both parties. The family are the arses here for blaming you. They should have let you in on this.", "NTA. Honestly you are hero. You made on spot decision. You didn't have info from bride that's this was OK. My guess is bride couldn't show happiness in her behavior over your decision and must have acted \"pissed\" to avoid backlash from family. But I think the payment speak for itself.", "NTA Although I did read the Post, I honestly didn't even need to to reach a NTA Vote. \n\nProposing at someone else's wedding has to be amongst one of the most tasteless things you could possibly do.

Unless this was something you were notified of ahead of time, you did the right thing. Huge taboo for someone else to \"steal the show\". The AH here is \"Kevin\".

Very professional in my opinion.", "who proposes at someone elses wedding , regardless of having permission... NTA", "NTA.

Sounds as though they may have actually had some pressure on them from relatives to have him propose at their wedding.

The idea is just tacky though, if I was proposed to at someone else\u2019s wedding, I\u2019d be really annoyed. I wouldn\u2019t feel like it was a special moment for me, and I\u2019d feel guilty about focus being drawn away.

She's probably being diplomatic because she'd get shit if she let them know she wasn't okay with it. You're not the one ruining her special day.", "NTA. Seems to me like the bride is trying to push past it and doesn\u2019t want to give her honest opinion to avoid family complaining to her instead.", "The proposal should have been made super clear when the song req was made.

And a generous tip shows you were 'going above and beyond.'\n\nThe US restaurant industry has changed the meaning of tipping.\n\nTake your well-earned tip, say sorry to all the people calling you aholes, (see it as a kind of after sale service for the generous bride to take any heat off the newlyweds).\n\nAnd remember to never dj for family members that messaged you, if possible.", "NTA\n\nThe bride and groom should have given you a heads up if they knew about it for this exact reason. I'm wondering if they told you to take all requests for this reason, but that's really not enough information for you to assume this is okay.", "Your response to the situation was epic and announcing proposals, pregnancies and other big events that purposefully draw attention away from the wedded couple are justifiably frowned upon. So NTA. You did good.", "NTA I feel if bride and groom knew this was going to happen they should\u2019ve at least given the heads up to avoid any misunderstandings.", "NTA and I'm not sure if anyone is. Usually brides and grooms get really jealous when attention is taken off of them at a wedding and you were looking out for them to make their night magical. That's what your job is and you did that. If the family and bride/groom had another plan then it makes no sense why they would not tell you when you'd have to be in on it too. \n\nI get why family is upset and I get why the bride is conflicted. I understand why some friends say you're not the a hole. I can see all sides. It is what it is at this point so they'll just have to get over it.", "NTA.\n\nThis sounds like the bride wasn't cool with it, couldn't say it to her family, and can't have evidence of being against it. So she just slipped the DJ some extra $$$ and can't say more.", "NTA\n\nWithout a specific instruction from either the Bride or Groom then you were correct to assume what you did. FFS , even Kevin didn't tell you what he was doing and tried to do pull a sneaky one.\n\nIf I was you, ( although I assume its too late) I would have pleaded ignorance. No one told you so how were you supposed to know, or that one of the guests shouting to play more dance music so you did.\n\nIts done now, so there is no point in them complaining. I suppose all you can do is tell them when the the next wedding you hear about and they can try to make themselves the center of attention there instead.", "Seems like the bride is giving one word responses and being vague so that you won\u2019t be able to prove anything with her messages. And yes the fact that she gave you more money means she agreed with that you did. However, I would have just let the record play and let it be a family problem and not your own problem.", "NTA.  You made the right move and if the family knew, wspecially the bride, then they should have communicated that with you.  Good for you looking out for the bride and groom!  I feel like part of the extra pay was her low-key thanking you for keeping the day about them.  Asking someone to marry you in front of other people at another person's wedding, regardless of relationship to the bride and groom, is tacky and disrespectful as hell.", "NTA and that's so funny,  I could almost hear the \"woh-woh-woh\" sound from gag shows when he got up from kneeling.", "Definitely NTA - you protected your clients and the integrity of the event with the information you had.\n\nIt would be well worth telling future couples (when discussing taking requests) that you've had people use requests to try to stage an impromptu proposal or take the mic and sing along in the past - so unless you know about it beforehand, you'll shut it down as the wedding is about them.", "NTA. If it's what the bride wanted, she would have told the DJ beforehand.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s wild that people propose at someone else\u2019s wedding. Are you that lame that you can\u2019t throw a party or put something cute together that you have to mooch so hard on someone\u2019s special day. Ick", "NTA, you were part of the production, and they made you an unwilling abettor when they had you play that song.\n\nIf anyone in the situation had let you know what was going on, you could have ran it by your client.\n\nAll you did was change the music to disrupt disruptive behavior on the dance floor; that\u2019s totally your job. Touch call to make bc it is a special moment, but that\u2019s what they get for railroading you like that.", "There is no way in hell that the bride would decline to mention it was okay beforehand if she knew about it and was fine with it. I\u2019m betting she had no idea and her family deliberately kept it from her because they knew she wouldn\u2019t be okay with it.", "How to know the bride knows and approves? The wedding I was at the bride was about to throw a bouquet, then she didn't, she turned around and approached one of the guests ( her brother's fiance) and handed her the bouquet. When the fiance turned around, the bride's brother was standing on one knee  with a ring. The bride knew and was in on it. Beautiful moment. \nIf the bride knew and approved in your situation, she would tell you. Don't sweat. Maybe the family expected him to propose, were forcing it on the  bride and therefore taking away from her beautiful day and she was happy you did what you did deep down inside.", "Just asking out of curiosity because the western culture is alien to me, (I'm from south asia) why is it considered inappropriate?", "Haha that would be epic \ud83e\udd23", "I love this response. \n\n\nNTA OP.

When requests started incoming he went to double checked with me personally If it's OK to play them.

Because if ANYTHING goes wrong, you know MOTB is gonna be the first and loudest to complain and blame, so she needs to witness just as proof your not lying about the bride and groom and whoever else \"swears they said it\".", "I agree,it's nasty and lazy to just take advantage of someone else's venue and setting to propose. Just rent your own place,get a nice restaurant or something,not hog on the bride and groom's efforts.

Pay up or gtfo and find your own.", "This whole hijacking-other-people's-wedding thing bugs me.\n\nWanting to take advantage of someone else's wedding party to make a proposal without having to spend a dime is and very likely to remain an issue for time to come, because so many people think it's ok while others don't.\n\nAnd yet... just yesterday a bride-to-be was nearly \"crucified\" by AITA redditors because she wanted to add an explicit mention in her wedding slip info, and everybody was saying \"it wasn't necessary, people have common sense\".\n\nApparently, too many people lack said common sense...\n\n(Disclaimer: yes, I know the bride I refer to also had other stuff in that slip that could be classified as overkill, but everybody here jumped at her for making the request of \"no proposals and no pregnancy announcements\")", "Also people went to OP after like \u201cit was her brother she\u2019s okay with it\u201d. Okay but, how the *fuck* would the DJ know who the brides brother is and know that it wasn\u2019t some random other guest trying to steal the spotlight and avoid hosting their own party with friends or family there?
