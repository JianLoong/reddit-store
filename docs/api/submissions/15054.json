I mostly DJ for just family and friends I\u2019m not really a professional, just do it for a little side cash from time to time. \n\nLast weekend I got invited to DJ on the cheap at a wedding for a friend of a friend. At the wedding while everyone was on the dance floor one of the guests we\u2019ll call him \u201cKevin\u201d approached me and asked if I could play the song \u201cGolden Hour\u201d It was an odd request because at this time all the guests were literally hoping around and dancing but I was told to take all requests so did it anyways. When I started playing it the dance floor started to clear up and then Kevin invited a woman onto the dance floor they started slow dancing for a bit, a few people joined them (including the bride and groom) Then at that one part of the song Kevin got down on one knee and I knew right away that he was going to propose. I didn\u2019t think it was right especially because they were in the middle of the dance floor with all eyes on them and I kinda felt like if this happened I would take the fault because I was the one to put on a romantic song out of nowhere. \n\nSo instead of letting that happened as soon as he pulled out the box I started to play \u201cBOOGIE\u201d and turned up the volume instead. After that Kevin just side-eyed me and got up and everyone else sat down. After that nothing else really happened and the tension was very thick. \n\nAfter the wedding no one really brought it up and I obviously thought that I wasn\u2019t the asshole and the friend that was friends with the bride said that I wasn\u2019t. But then a bunch of the family started to message me. It turns out that Kevin was the bride\u2019s brother and the family kept asking why I did that, I told them that proposing at someone else\u2019s wedding was not appropriate. They told me that I shouldn\u2019t have an opinion because I was just the DJ and now Kevin got publicly humiliated because some people knew this was going to happen so they were taking videos and live on Instagram so all their friends could see. I responded with \u201cthat would\u2019ve made the newly weds hurt\u201d but then they came back with \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have assumed that the bride didn\u2019t want that.\u201d \n\nThat part got me thinking because I was mostly communicating with the bride about arrangements and she was very chatty before the wedding but after that she kept give my me one word answers. So I assume she is mad at me but then again when she payed me she almost doubled the amount for what I was asking for with a generous tip? So im not sure if the bride actually knew I think she would\u2019ve told me.\n\n\nBut Aita for just assuming?", "created_utc": 1681764548, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pw8zf/aita_for_ruining_a_proposal_at_a_wedding/", "score": 911, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How are you supposed to know if it was planned? If the bride knew? If the bride was okay with it? If the groom was okay with it? Who the guy even is? You know nothing here. All you know is that it\u2019s typically inappropriate to propose at a wedding, and you reacted accordingly.

You don't just hijack somebody elses day!  So good on you sir, good on you!", "NTA - Better to assume that Kevin was trying to still some thunder and protect the bride and groom than let him do it and potentially ruin their wedding. If this was really a thing that they wanted to happen the Bride/Groom should be giving their approval.", "NTA. If this was a planned family thing, they should have told the person playing the music.

This was excellent quick thinking and customer service on your part. Consider that the bride is giving you one word answers because her brother just tried to one-up her at her own wedding, her entire family is on his side, and she's dealing with a ridiculous amount of family drama right now when she should be happily packing for her honeymoon and simply doesn't have time or the energy to give you anything more.", "NAH, but if you are going to run into the same circles with these people and you really \"have to know,\" reach out to the bride and say you \"would like to apologize because you have gotten a lot of angry comments about interrupting Kevin's proposal.

I would have been so happy if my DJ looked out for me like that. Thank you for making sure their day stayed special.", "NTA....

Instead they left you to make a judgement call, and I've seen *lots* of DJs at weddings change the song when things are going a bit off kilter.\n\nReally, if you'd done nothing and the proposal wasn't planned you'd be blamed for playing the song and letting it happen.

You\u2019re in charge of the dance floor, so to speak, as the DJ. But, I get the feeling that the bride knew about the proposal and even sanctioned it. However, she might have dropped the ball and didn\u2019t tell you, or she might have intentionally kept it quiet because she didn\u2019t want it to happen but didn\u2019t want to look like the asshole.

While it's true that proposing at someone else's wedding without permission is generally frowned upon, it wasn't your place as the DJ to interfere with someone else's moment. You should have let the proposal happen and let the bride and groom deal with any potential issues that might have arisen from it. It was not your job to make that decision for them.

I mostly DJ for just family and friends I\u2019m not really a professional, just do it for a little side cash from time to time. \n\nLast weekend I got invited to DJ on the cheap at a wedding for a friend of a friend. At the wedding while everyone was on the dance floor one of the guests we\u2019ll call him \u201cKevin\u201d approached me and asked if I could play the song \u201cGolden Hour\u201d It was an odd request because at this time all the guests were literally hoping around and dancing but I was told to take all requests so did it anyways. When I started playing it the dance floor started to clear up and then Kevin invited a woman onto the dance floor they started slow dancing for a bit, a few people joined them (including the bride and groom) Then at that one part of the song Kevin got down on one knee and I knew right away that he was going to propose. I didn\u2019t think it was right especially because they were in the middle of the dance floor with all eyes on them and I kinda felt like if this happened I would take the fault because I was the one to put on a romantic song out of nowhere. \n\nSo instead of letting that happened as soon as he pulled out the box I started to play \u201cBOOGIE\u201d and turned up the volume instead. After that Kevin just side-eyed me and got up and everyone else sat down. After that nothing else really happened and the tension was very thick. \n\nAfter the wedding no one really brought it up and I obviously thought that I wasn\u2019t the asshole and the friend that was friends with the bride said that I wasn\u2019t. But then a bunch of the family started to message me. It turns out that Kevin was the bride\u2019s brother and the family kept asking why I did that, I told them that proposing at someone else\u2019s wedding was not appropriate. They told me that I shouldn\u2019t have an opinion because I was just the DJ and now Kevin got publicly humiliated because some people knew this was going to happen so they were taking videos and live on Instagram so all their friends could see. I responded with \u201cthat would\u2019ve made the newly weds hurt\u201d but then they came back with \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have assumed that the bride didn\u2019t want that.\u201d \n\nThat part got me thinking because I was mostly communicating with the bride about arrangements and she was very chatty before the wedding but after that she kept give my me one word answers. So I assume she is mad at me but then again when she payed me she almost doubled the amount for what I was asking for with a generous tip? So im not sure if the bride actually knew I think she would\u2019ve told me.\n\n\nBut Aita for just assuming?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

These people need to get the fuck over themselves and grown the fuck up. I'm so grateful that they aren't actually your close friends.", "NTA. I am also a wedding DJ, I do it full time, and you did exactly the right thing in my book. I have a similar reaction if unexpected people, especially particularly intoxicated people get up to give toasts or want to grab the mic later in the night. I get a detailed list of who is speaking and when before the day even arrives, and even in the cases where the bride and groom want to open the floor for other people to say something, if I get one suspect look from the bride and groom when someone goes for a mic, that mic gets cut until it is in the hands of the bride and groom. \n\nIf the bride paid you that generous of a tip she was probably not aware that someone was about to be proposed to and was incredibly grateful that you did what you did to intercept. I\u2019ve had a proposal at a wedding I worked only once, and the bride warned me way beforehand that she was in on it on a phone call and the groom was on the call too. Her maid of honor was going to be in the group for the bouquet toss and she had planned to fake the throw then turn around and run it directly to the maid of honor instead and then cue the proposal. It was cute, and very clearly intentional to everyone in attendance. Proposing at someone else\u2019s wedding is such a taboo that couples will be very open about it to vendors and wedding planners that they\u2019re aware and okay with it happening so no one tries to intercept it, because let me tell you, I think every DJ, photographer, and venue or event coordinator I know personally would have stepped in in whatever way they could if they had been in the same situation.", "NTA.

However it was not your choice to make, and although you had good intentions, taking your job as wedding DJ very seriously. But if up to the family to support or not support someone else doing something that\u2019s considered bad wedding etiquette. That being said, anyone who is going against good wedding etiquette needs to make it very clear to those in charge of keeping the wedding going in its proper trajectory that this is what they\u2019re doing, and that they\u2019ve cleared it with the family first. It seems like everyone in the situation overstepped boundaries.", "Ya maybe hindsight is 20/20 here. But if I\u2019m the guy proposing, I\u2019m making sure every important person (like the DJ you\u2019re requesting a special song from) is in the know. Make sure one of the bride or groom tells them that it\u2019s chill if the guy uses their wedding as the spot to propose.

I am a music person and every song was picked for a reason, call me a bridezilla if you want. But anyway, the DJ was so nice at my wedding and worked great with the other vendors. However, he still felt the need to ask my husband if he could take requests because he had gotten a few. Idk why my husband of 2 hours didn't ask me or remember what I said about our playlist being every song meant something special to us... But anyway - he played the first request an 8 minute salsa song and it was our first argument being married.

The extra she paid speaks for itself.", "I kinda wonder if she did know but wasn't really happy about it", "No, bad advice.  The bride let her wallet do the talking.  OP needs to let it go.  The less said, the better.  OP is obviously the hero, NTA.", "This. Though I would say NTA. Because Kevin clearly is an asshole", "Paying double seems like a OMG YOU ARE MY HERO type of thing.", "Take my upvote, DJ should definitely use that for weddings \ud83d\ude02", "Yeah, ask the bride! I wanna hear her thoughts. \n\nNTA. If you were my DJ I would have also tipped you more.", "Please show us on the doll where it was glaringly obvious to the OP, at the time of said incident, that lots of people knew it was going to happen.\n\nNTA", "How is OP supposed to know any of that though? If they weren\u2019t told, how are they expected to see anything other than a random dude trying to propose at a wedding?", "Where do you see that Kevin had permission from the bride? All we have is the vague mention from family members that the DJ \"shouldn't assume the bride didn't want it\". Notice they've slyly refrained from confirming the bride did want it - and the bride has been conspicuously quiet herself.", ">You inserted yourself somewhere you weren't wanted, needed, or requested to be, and ruined this family's wedding memories in the process\n\n\nOp is not Kevin. It was Kevin who did that, not Op", "If a guest requested Der Ring des Nibelungen by Richard Wagner, which is about 15 hours long, you think OP would have been obligated to play it?", "Is that why the bride paid double the agreement with a generous tip?", "But it wasn't Kevin's moment. Is was the newlyweds moment. The DJ was thinking of his customers.", "If the couple had arranged this, they would have gone over it with all involved parties like the DJ.", "It is up to him to do the job he was paid to do, and since his clients never included this in their instructions, it's obvious his clients didn't consent to this.", "Neither of the newlyweds is complaining to him, though, and THEY are his customers.", "It\u2019s common sense that proposing at a wedding is inappropriate unless they get the okay from the bride and groom", "To me there is nothing wrong with OP. Plus the increase of pay by the bride and groom indicates OP did the right thing.\n\nIt is common knowledge that it is inappropriate to propose at someone else\u2019s wedding.

And I want a 3rd party witness there to verify. Preferably one of the other vendors. \n\nProposing at someone else's wedding is tacky AF", "This was my thinking. She was upset because someone TRIED to do something and even if the plan didn't go through fully, she feels a bit bitter and slighted. The abundant tip to the OP speaks louder to me.", "Yeah she may also want to avoid even commenting on the failed proposal in case another family member sees her thanking him for stopping it.", "She could just be busy on a honeymoon so her answers are short.", "That would explain her shift in personality.

I hate to explain myself to extroverts that have no regard to others.  I would do the same. Op is a saviour to us quiet folks, that get little to no say in such things. Because FAMILY IS FAMILY,  I hate that expression.", "Very pubic settings get me too", "For all we know, the bride was asked to communicate the request to OP, but didn\u2019t in the hopes that it was her last best chance to stop this.", "The couple didn't give him any don't play this song list. But I wouldn't have gone from upbeat to slow right away. There's a way to transition from everyone dancing to slow dances.", "Yeah, the fact the bride and groom were dancing when Kevin was about to ask implies they did not know in advance too.  I agree she was not happy about it.", "Exactly, no reason to make her fess up to her real feelings just to satisfy our curiosity for details.

I'll change my answer given the fact that he didn't know it was the brother and no one told him", "What if they where aware that this was going to happen? What if the bride and groom actually would have liked the proposal? Would that make OP TA for you?", "Definitely. I'm an introvert and wouldn't say it out loud, my payment would be secret and more then agreed upon. They knew what they were doing, op spoiled their plans. I wish people had the class op has. They get more from my money bucket. F the family", "Exactly. Not just someone: \n\n>It turns out that Kevin was the bride\u2019s brother\n\nShe wasn't angry with OP, she was angry with her idiot brother who tried to upstage her at her own wedding. OP did her a solid and she paid him like it.", "Yeah if I\u2019m pissed off I\u2019m not paying double! If it\u2019s really eating at you, maybe check in with your mutual friend.", "Yeah, this. Plausible deniability.", "More upvotes for this comment. Absolutely 100% this. OP saved the bride from being the bad guy by having to tell her family no about golden boy proposing at her wedding. She was trapped and couldn\u2019t say anything and you handled it. That\u2019s why she paid you double. Secret gratitude for life. They will be cackling telling this victory story to their real friends in 20 years.", "*snicker*\n\nAuto correct does that type of shit to me all the time.", "I would assume that Kevin's music choice killed the party vibe and guests left to get a drink of water and wait for a better song to rock it to.", "Then A) they would have been the first to complain to him and B) they would have refused to pay or demanded a discount or not tipped, not given an extremely generous tip.", "OP said the bride seemed upset and he was confused about the big tip. You also dodge the question. OP made a decision without knowing whether the bride and groom knew, and without knowing the exact circumstances. That wasn't his place in my opinion", "You can't just assume \"Every instruction I receive from random people is approved by the couple, so I should do it without question.\" It's actually the opposite - if your client didn't tell you in advance that something would be happening or that it was your job to do X or help with an X event or to expect X and comply when asked, the only proper response is to refuse unless you clear it with your client. If the couple had willingly arranged in advance for a family member to propose at the event, they would have included that in the plans that they shared with staff like the photographer, DJ, etc. It's illogical and dangerous to just assume \"Anything they DIDN'T specifically say isn't okay must therefore be okay!\"\n\nIf the bride was upset about the DJ ruining the proposal, she wouldn't have generously tipped the DJ, and she or the groom would have complained. She did neither, so it's logical to conclude she was happy about the DJ's performance and therefore that he did not disobey her wishes. As plenty of others have posted, she probably seemed awkward about the subject because she didn't really want to allow that proposal but got bullied into it.\n\n\"Well, you're just assuming all that!\" No, I'm drawing my conclusions based on the bride's behavior, the logical behavior of people planning weddings (i.e. sharing details with the staff!), and the logical response to your staff doing something wrong (i.e. not giving an overly generous tip). There is no evidence supporting the statement of people who did not hire OP and whose wedding it was not that it was wrong for OP to stop the proposal."]}
