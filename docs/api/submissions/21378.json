I've been with my wife for 6 years now and we are currently awaiting the arrival of our first born. She's due in 3 weeks. My wife admittedly hates this ex, with good reason. My ex went psycho when I moved on. But after a year, things died down and we both forgot the other existed. \n\nNow, I want to mention that I had nothing but good intentions here. My wife was at her mom's for the day, baby shower planning. She was supposed to be home late. Around 8pm I go to the store and I saw my ex on the sidewalk with her 2yo. I ask her what's going on. She basically tells me her baby daddy kicked her and the kid out and her phone was dead so she couldn't call anyone and said she had no money so she couldn't get a hotel or food. I bought her and her kid food and told them to get in. However, money is tight right now so I couldn't spend money on a hotel for her either. \n\nAnyways, I get home and set my ex up in the living room with her kid and cartoons. I then go call my wife and ask where she is and give her the run down and she immediately lost it completely. Told me she wouldn't be coming back, that I fucked up and she will never forgive me, that I should have either minded my business or \"played hero\" by calling someone, not by bringing her home with me. Said I was basically dead to her and she would only be contacting me to tell me when my kid is born. I've talked to people about this (I ended up bringing ex to her mom's around 3am, when she was able to get a hold of her) and everyone is 50/50. Some think I was right to not leave a kid on the street and others say that I'm a fucking idiot and that I'd be lucky to be forgiven.\n\nETA: this is the one person my wife has asked me not to have anything to do with. Given the nature of what my ex did when she found out I was seeing my now wife. So this isn't my wife showing her \"true colors\". It's the one person she hates, so I get it, but there was a child involved.", "created_utc": 1688529695, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14qzlbn/aita_for_giving_my_ex_and_her_daughter_somewhere/", "score": 468, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They may need to rely on and trust that their partner has their best interest at heart more than at any other time in their life. \n\nBased on your comments this was the ONE person your wife asked you to have nothing to do with. This one person had behaved manipulatively and toxicly towards your wife in the past.

Your wife who is your present is due in 3 weeks and you care about bringing your ex home?

Your ex tried to (in your words) destroy your wife's life, and you thought it would be a good idea to invite her to your and your very pregnant wife's home/safe space? You could have bought them food and dropped them at her mom's house, taken them to a shelter, contacted social services, taken them to one of the ex's friend's homes, charged her phone and let her deal with it as an adult, or just respected your wife's wishes. Instead, you chose to show your wife that you are not a safe person who respects her in the least.

Definitely!  You knew your wife would not want this person anywhere near her home.  Yeah there was a child involved but there were other things that could have been done like taking her to one of her friend's houses.  You f'd up majorly.", "Well you opened a can of worms when all you needed to do called her mom or drop her off at her mom.  \n\nYTA.

I applaud the impulse to help but you had to know exactly how your wife would feel.\nYou could have done a dozen things- helped her get to a women's shelter,  helped her call someone,  taken them to Buger King for a bite to eat and a chance for your ex to think for 5 minutes, called around to see if someone else could help her (preferably someone she had not already burned her bridges with)....but you decided to bring the only person in the world that your pregnant wife holds real (and justified) malice towards into your home. Dude, you may as well have cheated on her sexually- that's the level of betrayal here.\n\nYou will be lucky if you are forgiven and if you are,  you need to do whatever she thinks will repair what you broke.", "You brought your toxic ex into the home you share with your very pregnant wife. Your wife definitely won\u2019t feel safe in her home now. Good job. You just proved to your wife that her feelings don\u2019t matter when it concerns your ex.

Are you rethinking your marriage? What would compel you to bring the *one person* your wife has told you she doesn't want around into her home? \n\nBecause let's be real, it has nothing to do with the kid. If it had been some random woman and her kid sitting outside when you walked by you wouldn't have given them a second glance.

This way you don't bring the drama home.  Inviting them to your house offers them nothing outside of a place to stay for the night with nothing but the option to just kick them out the next day with nowhere else to go and back to square one.  Also expecting your pregnant wife to just go along with it, you really will quite possibly never get past this with her.", "YTA. Seriously YTA. Just to repeat YTA.", "YTA you literally brought home the one person your wife told you never to contact.

Like you know YTA right? You cant be this dumb? You invite the one person your wife despises into her sanctuary.

If there was absolutely no person to take them, you should have called your wife to discuss your worries about the two year old (out of earshot of the ex), and maybe, with your wife's green light, offered to let just the child sleep at your house for the night, but not your ex. Another option may have been asking if your wife's mom (or another person you know) could put them up. Odd, I know, but it guarantees your ex wouldn't try to burrow in to stay and would have left very quickly, while everything would have stayed above-board on all fronts, including respecting your wife's well-earned boundaries with this person.

But I think what you did was kind nevertheless. \n\nWhen I was a young, extremely broke single mother struggling with depression, I lost a waitressing because I wasn't making enough money in tips to pay for childcare for my three year old son. I was evicted from my crappy apartment and was thrown out on the street. \n\nI remember walking down a main street in Miami when a cook who had worked at my restaurant drove by. He slowed down when he saw it was me and stopped the car. After I told him what happened, he let me and my son move into his one bedroom apartment (we slept on the couch). \n\nThis kind near stranger let me stay with him until I could get back on my feet, find a job, and find a room to  rent.

Would her mom answer people pounding on the door? Did you even think about that before you brought your wife\u2019s worst enemy into her home?? I am saying ESH and only because there is a homeless child involved and your wife should probably consider that aspect. But this is like 99.9999999% you are the asshole.

My ex is also 28 and has a 2yo daughter (not mine). I've been with my wife for 6 years now and we are currently awaiting the arrival of our first born. She's due in 3 weeks. My wife admittedly hates this ex, with good reason. My ex went psycho when I moved on. But after a year, things died down and we both forgot the other existed. \n\nNow, I want to mention that I had nothing but good intentions here. My wife was at her mom's for the day, baby shower planning. She was supposed to be home late. Around 8pm I go to the store and I saw my ex on the sidewalk with her 2yo. I ask her what's going on. She basically tells me her baby daddy kicked her and the kid out and her phone was dead so she couldn't call anyone and said she had no money so she couldn't get a hotel or food. I bought her and her kid food and told them to get in. However, money is tight right now so I couldn't spend money on a hotel for her either. \n\nAnyways, I get home and set my ex up in the living room with her kid and cartoons. I then go call my wife and ask where she is and give her the run down and she immediately lost it completely. Told me she wouldn't be coming back, that I fucked up and she will never forgive me, that I should have either minded my business or \"played hero\" by calling someone, not by bringing her home with me. Said I was basically dead to her and she would only be contacting me to tell me when my kid is born. I've talked to people about this (I ended up bringing ex to her mom's that night) and everyone is 50/50. Some think I was right to not leave a kid on the street and others say that I'm a fucking idiot and that I'd be lucky to be forgiven.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It would be heartbreaking to see a toddler out on the streets. But the problem is that the ex isn't just any ex. She has apparently tried to cause trouble in the past for your wife.
