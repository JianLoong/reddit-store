I know this is a typical man issue, but I try to remind him to brush his teeth and wash his face. When I ask him, he often will choose just not to do it or be upset with me for asking\u2026and then will have plaque build up/super dry skin. \n\nAnother piece that\u2019s not hygiene related is that he has a severe food allergy that has put in the hospital several times. When we are out to eat I have told our waiter about his allergy and he gets upset because I am \u201cbabying\u201d him so then I remind him to tell the waitstaff when he doesn\u2019t. It just seems stupid because at the end of the day my priority is keeping him alive. \n\nAwhile ago we got in a fight because he thought I was babying him too much, so I stopped reminding him to brush his teeth. He went to the dentist this week and has 5 cavities and it\u2019s going to cost us $500.\n\nThis is a big deal to me, we don\u2019t have enough money to just take up expenses like this. He is not acting like it\u2019s a big deal.\n\nI noticed he didn\u2019t brush his teeth yesterday morning or last night OR this morning. This morning I reminded him and asked how we can make sure he remembers to avoid dental expenses like this in the future. \n\nHis answer is to just \u201cleave me be\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s a process\u201d. But he simply didn\u2019t remember to brush his teeth unless I remind him. He will list excuses like he doesn\u2019t want to be late for work, or he wants to finish his coffee first, but I just think something needs to change. \n\nHe got really upset with me and was talking in circles saying that I don\u2019t need to remind him or anything but I simply don\u2019t want more dental bills like this.\n\nAlso, he has a history of lying to me (I think you can see my other posts on my account), so I am worried the next time he gets a cavity he won\u2019t tell me anyway.\n\nSo am I the asshole for reminding my husband to brush his teeth?\n\nEDIT: By typical man issue I meant just like cleanliness in general\u2026which is a mass generalization I realize\u2026but I am not referring to teeth brushing specifically. He often tells me I am very particular on cleanliness, but I just like my spaces clean lol. He has adjusted to accommodate my home cleanliness desires quite a bit.\n\nWe didn\u2019t move in together until after we were engaged and that\u2019s when we pursued counseling because I had an issue with his habits.
