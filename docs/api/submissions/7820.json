I dont think people understand how low the rates of mental illness are/were in older generations.\n\nRates of psychotic disorders have been relatively stable in the last 100 years or so, about 1% of the population of any society. Whats changed *dramatically* are the rates of mood, anxiety and personality disorders. In people under 30 the projected lifetime rate of depression is *1 in 2.* Fifty fucking percent. The lifetime rate of depression in people over 60 is something like 1 in 30, with the patient outcomes being significantly improved over people under 30. Remission and response rates are something like 80% improved in the 60+ category over the sub 30 patient population. Anti-Depressant use has increased over 400% since 1988\\~ to 2005\\~ *and* we are still seeing rapidly rising rates of mood, anxiety and personality disorders.\n\nThis isnt to say that mental health isnt a very real and major concern, it is. IMO we are experiencing the largest global health crisis ever seen.I think its important to remember that older people were simply built different, raised in \"better\" conditions the human mind was more amenable to. To them mental health problems were very rare and more treatable which is a very different landscape than what we have now. I have found virtually everyone can understand the real suffering people with mental illness experience if mental illness is explained through the lense of normal human behavior. Instead of talking about how much pain you feel, how sad you are or suicidal tendencies because of depression frame depression (or another disorder) as a familiar but painful normal experience. \"When somebody you love dearly dies, the pain you feel in that moment, I experience that all the time and it doesnt relent. Everyday, all the time, no matter what as a result of my depression (or another disorder)\n\nEDIT: Heres one for anxiety. I like to have people imagine a time when they were really stressed. Then have them imagine what it would have been like for that stress to happen for no identifiable reason, it just happens out of nowhere. Then to really drive it home have them imagine that random crippling stress but none of the coping strategies or outlets they used to relax worked anymore. Have them sit with that feeling of panic and stress then let them know thats how people with anxiety disorders experience everyday life.\n\nWhen put through a lense of shared experience I have found older people to be very open and understanding of mental wellbeing.", "NTA\n\nFirst off I completely relate to this situation since my mother practically used me as a therapist, but only to vent things to me, and told me things I just should\u2019ve never known.\n\n\nNow yes, you should be there for your brother no matter what, however a therapist is honestly the best option to get past his mental problems.

At least 2 times a year to make sure everything is OK.\n\nI'm sorry for the emotional labor your family is trying to dump on you and I hope you can get the help you need for your own struggles.", "NTA", "NTA Tell your parents\u2026to well PARENT! He isn\u2019t YOUR SON! I find it kind of pathetic that their first reaction after he talked to them was to call a 16 year old down and ask what they can do to help THEIR son. Are they that dense about everything or just mental health ?", "NTA. You are a teen struggling yourself, a licensed therapist is an adult who can usually if needed get medication prescribed for a patient and doesn't JUST listen, they provide valid coping strategies depending on the issue to help someone have an improved life.", "Are you the asshole for refusing to undertake a role for which you are completely unqualified? Umm, no.\n\nNTA but your family needs to put your brother's needs above their fear that he might tell the therapist things they don't want aired.", "NTA  Trying to get your brother into therapy IS being his backbone. He urgently needs that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour parents are abusive AHs.", "NTA\n\nShame on your parents for thinking that seeking for help for your mental health is bad. They need to realise that you're not a fully grown adult to deal with another humans emotions even if it's your brother. \nYour parents should snap out of their bubbles and acknowledge that help is necessary. \n\nFor now, you can give your parents space, be there for your brother (13M), and try to seek out for help for your own mental health.", "NTA you should refuse no matter what it\u2019s just irresponsible to put a teenager in the place of a professional therapist, I have a good friend that also had some problems (I\u2019d rather be as least specific as possible) and honestly the best thing I did for them is talking to them about therapy, what is it and what it has done for me, I didn\u2019t try to claim I understand or try to fix them just some sympathy", "NTA - you were very correct to say what you said about him needing professional help.   They're the ones that escalated the \"yelling\", then you gave them the same energy and now their clutching their pearls?  Parents seem to hate it when their kids emulate their behavior don't they?     Just in cause they don't get him help, research self help groups/online or in person as well as books.    You and your brother might have to help yourselves in spite of your folks.    All of reddit is sending you two healing vibes.", "NTA and your parents need therapy also because they\u2019re feeling butthurt about the fact that they need someone else to do a job that they feel like they should have been able to do. They\u2019re taking it too personally and making it about them.", "NTA  - there is a reason people take years of training and accreditation and have regular supervision and insurance and ongoing professional development as therapists - because it is an actual profession. Does your family expect you to carry out an appendectomy  even though you are not a doctor or design a building if you are not an architechn- if not then why expect you to be functioning as a child and adolescent therapist (a specialism all of its own)", "NTA\n\nYou are his sister NOT a therapist to help him deal with his problems. He NEEDS professional help you can't give him.", "NTA\n\nyour parents on the other hand..\n\nif both of you have mental health problems *there's generally a reason* called *parents*\n\nhopefully both you and your brother find competent therapists you like", "NTA your parents need to remember being part of each other's back bones includes accepting when one of your family members should be going to therapy.", "with parenting like that, it's no wonder you and your brother suffer from mental health issues.  \n\nI hope that you are both able to get the help you need and deserve.\n\nNTA", "Yiiiiiikes!\nYou\u2019re 100% NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to let your bro vent to you about a bad day or whatever but you\u2019re right, you\u2019re not a therapist and it sounds like everyone if your family could really use a therapist of their own for just, so, so many reasons.\n\nIt sounds like your parents have some deeply rooted stigmas surrounding mental health. I hope you can overcome them and get the help you, and your brother need. As for your older bro, it\u2019s a shame he\u2019s internalizing the same ideas but to be clear, he\u2019s wrong, you\u2019re not the asshole for not taking on something that you\u2019re not qualified to do.", "NTA. Your parents view of therapy is clearly unhealthy. There is nothing wrong with getting therapy, but there is a lot wrong with trying to isolate mental illness to the family and hide it away and deal with it privately. That's how a lot of people get really messed up before they finally seek help as adults (if they can ever get over the mental barriers their parents installed in them to seek it) and it takes way longer to fix the trauma than it does to prevent it. Your parents will be actively harming your brother's mental health by not addressing this properly, albeit unintentionally.", "NTA\n\n\"If its so easy to be a backbone why did you call me down to comfort him instead of you doing it? You got mad at me for not knowing how to do the thing you didn't know how to do? Are you serious?\"", "It sounds like the whole family needs therapy, there seems to be a disconnect between them all. It seems cruel to deny a kid the professional help they need to work through their mental health.\n\nSadly, OPs parents sound like the type of people who don't \"believe\" in therapy. NTA.", "I Agree NTA!!  It's good to be able to turn to our family members for support, understanding, and love. However, just because our family can give us the support and love and understanding that we might need does not mean that they can give us the professional tools and skills that a trained therapist can give. \n\nI sincerely hope both you and your brother can get the mental health help that you both need before it becomes dangerous for either of you to not have that help.", "Disrespectfully, OP\u2019s parents are a-holes.", "This.  NTA.", "There's a reason both of their kids have issues that need help.", "I don't think a 16 yo should be the one to explain mental health to her parents.  It will end with lots of yelling like this previous discussion.  The power imbalance is too great.  A school counselor, their pastor or rabbi, or some other adult who is knowledgeable about therapy could help.", "Some of that is because you used to be able to buy all KINDS of stuff over the counter that you need a prescription for now.\n\nHousewives in the 30s and 40s didn't have depression! They had amphetamines and barbiturates. Sometimes in the same pill.", "That may have made a difference. I think the reality is far more complex and nuanced than just the availaility of OTC narcotics.   \n\n\nAs far as im aware the most effective class of drugs for depression are the tricyclics and those werent available until 1960. I think people tend to downplay how complicated mood disorders really are. They like to point to one or two things and blame all our problems on them. I wont give you my whole thing on depression as a disease of metabolic health and society lol, I hope you get my point anyways"]}
