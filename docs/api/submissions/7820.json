The fact that your parents don\u2019t recognize that mental health problems require professional help is deeply disturbing. He needs family, yes. But family isn\u2019t a solution to address mental health issues. Your parents do not understand mental health problems, so they yell at you. They are the AH here. I hope you and your brother can help you need without them.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re right. You\u2019re not his therapist. On a side note, if you\u2019re dealing with issues, you need therapy as well.", "Somethings wrong with your parents, no disrespect. Typically, people who criticize therapists have a secret, or two, they're hiding. I'm not trying to put strife between you and your parents but therapy is not a bad thing and people need to understand that and be willing to acknowledge that it's beneficial.\n\nNTA", "NTA, I can see how this situation went down so clearly its unreal.\n\nIt was a calm and genuine suggestion which, for whatever reason, your parents decided to escalate into a screaming match, and at that point the conversation was already over anyway.\n\nNext time your 17 yo brother calls you an A, tell him to be the therapist instead.\n\nListening is one thing, and thats good, if you just pushed your brother away every time then you would be an A. \n\nBut theres a difference between listening and a licensed therapist giving advice, thats the point of their job", "Hard NTA. As somebody with mental health issues, the last thing I would want is somebody not remotely qualified to do so to give me therapy/advice on how to handle said mental health issues. Your brother needs therapy, and your parents need to pull their heads out of their arses.", "NTA,\n\nIt's good that your brother can talk to you. Sometimes we do just need some love and support from our family. \n\nBut you're right, you're not a therapist and anyone struggling with mental health needs to see a professional about it. \n\nYour parents are being entirely unreasonable, expecting you to entirely take the burden of your brother's mental health when he could just go see a therapist who is fully equipped to help him.", "NTA. You are the only one he talked to and therefore you know best if he needs a therapist. I also think that since you mentioned having mental problems yourself, you may have wished for a therapist who would be there to listen and not judge. \nI don't know where you're from but if it's anywhere where therapy is free and they have confidentiallity policy (so they won't tell your parents), you might benefit from it.", "NTA. Some parents want older siblings to take care of younger siblings which is wrong. It is not your duty to be your brother's therapist.", "NTA and also not a professional. So many people are in pain because families believe love and the support of family are all they need. No, people with mental health struggles need someone who has been educated about their condition and have the proper tools to help. Also, the family needs to be free of that responsibility so they can offer personal support without the baggage of being the therapist as well.", "So.\n\nYour parent's asked for your opinion and then proceeded to go mad when you said your opinion.\n\nNTA and they are, very much.\n\nYou're right. None of you are capable of giving your brother professional help. Trying to fix the situation in the family is likely to make your sibling's problems worse.", "nta. you shouldnt have to shoulder the burden unless you want to. even then its always good to look to a professional for help.", "NTA. If I can offer a piece of advice. When people or family members are dismissive about therapy I always explain it like this. Would you have my brother come to me with a broken ankle or sinus infection and expect me to treat it? No, then during this medical emergency you should seek the help of a professional. Therapy is medicine just like antibiotics and surgery.\nYour job as the family is to assist in the recovery but not to diagnose and treat the illness.", "NTA\n\nyou are absolutely right...you are not a therapist and if he has serious mental health issues he needs one. \n\nSelf diagnosis or peer diagnosis mean nothing...he needs someone trained properly so he can have a healthy long term solution.", "NTA. How brave of your brother! Your opinion was sought and it was sound - they just didn't like it. The stigma that surrounds mental health in some families is remarkably sad. I hope you can seek out a counselor at school who can point you in the right direction for your own health and may have a suggestion for how your brother could get help. You're right - you can be a suuportive sister, but you're not a trained professional. It's like asking you to treat a case of pneumonia or a fracture. Good luck, OP.", "Absolutely positively NTA. I don\u2019t understand why this is your parents reaction to trying to get your brother the help he needs and deserves??!! You should be his therapist, but you can continue to be his brother and someone to lean on. But you\u2019re not a professional and that\u2019s what your brother needs. They asked for you opinion and you gave it honestly. Your parents make no sense! I hope they get him the help he needs!!", ">That\u2019s when I snapped and told her I wasn\u2019t a therapist and won\u2019t ever be my brother's therapist.\n\nAbsolutely right. Talking with family can be good, but therapy it ain't. If you want you hair cut, do you go to your mom or to a barber? If you are ill, you dad or a doctor? Tooth ache, brother or a dentist? \n\nMental health isn't any different.", ">I have serious mental health problems, which I don\u2019t like people knowing about therefore I keep it to myself.\n\nI have to wonder if your parents have previously expressed the idea that therapy/mental health is worthless/doesn't exist and you've somehow internalized that to mean you should keep it to yourself. Their reaction to your suggestion + your thoughts on your own problems suggest that belief is prevalent. NTA", "NTA. You are not his parent. And you are definitely not his therapist. You have no training in that. My parents, especially my mother, have treated me like a therapist for years. They're always complaining about their problems and they get mad when I say I'm not their therapist. That's why I rarely visit them. It's bad enough talking to them on the phone. Listening to them complain is draining and stressful.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If therapy is necessary, it is because there is something that cannot be dealt with by those around that person. Waiting for family to help without therapy is one of the reasons problems tend to never be addressed or addressed much later because family put band-aids in an infected wound", "NTA. You have your brothers back and are supporting him by telling your parents he needs therapy.", "NTA", "NTA OP. Sorry you had to go through that.\n\nAs the therapist of the family growing up, I speak from extensive experience in the field of 'Just trying my very best to keep everyone semi-sane but not having a fecking clue what I'm doing due to me being a child and not a therapist.' \n\nDon't.

Do it for me, for my poor young self.", "NTA. Based on their reaction, I'm guessing that maybe your parents see therapy as something... intense? And not as a tool to help you, which is unfortunate. You've been listening to your brother, so it's not as if you've been ignoring his feelings all this time. They can't expect you to help him get past this on your own when you have your own problems to worry about. You do what you can, but yeah, you're not a therapist. You don't know how to help him. Maybe your parents just don't fully understand mental health/mental illness and think it's an easy fix? But your response could have been better. You could have explained to them that you've been talking to him about it, but a therapist might actually be able to help him improve his mental health, which you don't know how to do.", "1000% NTA. If anything your parents are. The stuff they told you to do is what *they* should be doing as the parent. If they feel like it's beyond them, then yes, they need to find a therapist for your brother. I'm trying to not go off about the parents here, but clearly they are awful for how they handled this.", "NTA. You are correct - you aren\u2019t a therapist - you aren\u2019t trained for this. Not only do you not have the skills to help your brother, but you don\u2019t have the skills to make sure you don\u2019t break under the pressure. And it isn\u2019t fair for your parents or your brother to put this pressure on you.", "NTA\nYou AND your brother need health care, therapy. Your parents can and should help access this for you. It's completely inappropriate, and somewhat abusive, for your parents to abdicate their responsibility to provide appropriate health care for their children by making the children responsible for doing the work of professionals.", "NTA.  Being a therapist is not the same thing as seeking support &/or a backbone.  So your parents argument is not credible.  \n\nIf my family member needs mental help, I can support them by helping them find a therapist &/or mental health professional, driving them them to appointments, encouraging them to try someone else if their first therapist doesn\u2019t click with them, etc.  What I cannot do is BE the therapist &/or mental health professional.  \n\nMental/emotional health are JUST as vital & just as real as physical health.
