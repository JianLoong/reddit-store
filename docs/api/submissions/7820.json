They can't expect you to help him get past this on your own when you have your own problems to worry about. You do what you can, but yeah, you're not a therapist. You don't know how to help him.

I hope both you and your brother get the help and care you need and yes, maybe down the road sit them down and try to more calmly explain why therapy isn't negative as well as addressing their blatant disregard of someone's mental health needs as \"getting a backbone.\"", "For a lot of people born before or around 1960 mental health literally doesnt exist. I dont think people understand how low the rates of mental illness are/were in older generations.\n\nRates of psychotic disorders have been relatively stable in the last 100 years or so, about 1% of the population of any society. Whats changed *dramatically* are the rates of mood, anxiety and personality disorders. In people under 30 the projected lifetime rate of depression is *1 in 2.* Fifty fucking percent. The lifetime rate of depression in people over 60 is something like 1 in 30, with the patient outcomes being significantly improved over people under 30. Remission and response rates are something like 80% improved in the 60+ category over the sub 30 patient population. Anti-Depressant use has increased over 400% since 1988\\~ to 2005\\~ *and* we are still seeing rapidly rising rates of mood, anxiety and personality disorders.\n\nThis isnt to say that mental health isnt a very real and major concern, it is. IMO we are experiencing the largest global health crisis ever seen.I think its important to remember that older people were simply built different, raised in \"better\" conditions the human mind was more amenable to. To them mental health problems were very rare and more treatable which is a very different landscape than what we have now. I have found virtually everyone can understand the real suffering people with mental illness experience if mental illness is explained through the lense of normal human behavior. Instead of talking about how much pain you feel, how sad you are or suicidal tendencies because of depression frame depression (or another disorder) as a familiar but painful normal experience. \"When somebody you love dearly dies, the pain you feel in that moment, I experience that all the time and it doesnt relent. Everyday, all the time, no matter what as a result of my depression (or another disorder)\n\nEDIT: Heres one for anxiety. I like to have people imagine a time when they were really stressed. Then have them imagine what it would have been like for that stress to happen for no identifiable reason, it just happens out of nowhere. Then to really drive it home have them imagine that random crippling stress but none the coping strategies or outlets they used to relax worked anymore. Have them sit with that feeling of panic and stress then let them know thats how people with anxiety disorders experience everyday life.\n\nWhen put through a lense of shared experience I have found older people to be very open and understanding of mental wellbeing."]}
