Of course, I accepted was super excited for her. The two of us met in KY 15 years ago, and then my family moved, eventually settling in Chicago. Our families remained close despite the distance. Since being asked to be a bridesmaid, I have moved up to Wisconsin for school and in the past year have started working at my campus\u2019 daycare,  which I have thrived at and I am very hopeful that I will be offered a full time position when I graduate in May. \n\nMy friends wedding is the last Saturday of October. 2 saturdays ago was her bridal shower and party. Getting time off at my job is very hard and has led me to only seeing my family a few times a year and my friends back home and extended family once a year. We can ask of months in advance, but it all comes down to finding another student worker who is willing to take my shift in my classroom. For her bridal weekend, I was unable to get Friday off. After work, I took a 5 hour bus ride to Chicago arriving around 9. I had an early flight the next morning and needed to be up at 3 am, the same for my returning flight Sunday. I, admittedly last minute, informed my friend that this meant I would need to have an early night on Saturday and leave her party early. She became very mad at me calling me a bad bridesmaid and friend. So, I flew into KY around 9, immediately changed and went to the shower and then stayed out until 1. Got to my 7 am flight back to chicago, and then busses back to Campus. I was exhausted, but I know she was happy I was able to stay the whole time. \nNow, we are 2 weeks away from the wedding. The bride told me she wants me to get to KY the Wednesday before the wedding to do bonding activities and the rehearsal dinner at her moms place. I informed her that as of now, no one has offered to take my Wednesday and Friday shifts, but I could very easily get there Friday night. She lashed out once again, saying I am selfish for not being willing to fly in Thursday and call in sick Friday, despite the fact they know I am not sick. We are short staffed, it\u2019s a teaching crisis, coverage is hard to find especially last minute. I told her that it sucks my workplace is like this,  but lying to my employer is not something I want to do especially since I really need a job offer in these next few months. She told me I would never treat my family like this, she told me if I loved her I would jeopardize work for her, and other nasty stuff. She gave me an ultimatum that I either arrive Thursday or I don\u2019t come at all. I told her that\u2019s not possible as of right now, and she has since rescinded my bridesmaid position and blocked me on everything except text. At this point, I don\u2019t want to be her friend or attend her wedding at all. There\u2019s more I couldn\u2019t fit in this word limit, but her behavior has been very selfish and hurtful.

Friendship works both ways even when someone is getting married.", "NTA. I feel like people need to understand that their weddings are not the most important day in everyone else\u2019s lives.\n\nAnd also clarification: did she just tell you to come Thursday? Or has that been the expectation for months?", "ESH. Being a bridesmaid means party and rehearsal (always the day or 2 before) as well as the wedding and that's vare minimum. You knew the travel hassle and still chose to take on the role. She went too far with the ultimatum but she is justifiably upset with you. If your job is like this now what makes you think it'll be better? I would start looking elsewhere anyway", "ESH \n\nHow long have you known about the plans/dates for the wedding and bridal activities? I suspect this information was not sprung on you last minute. It does not sound like you did your due diligence to get your shift covered when you found out when these things were happening. \n\nYour (ex?) friend is asking a bit much to expect you to be there on Wednesday for \"bonding activities\" given that you've explained how hard it is to find coverage. Friday, reasonable. Wednesday? Not so much. \n\nAgain, depending on how much notice you had to get coverage, I can understand why she would feel slighted. You seemed to have enough notice to get flights, so it doesn't seem unreasonable that you could have also tried to find someone to cover your shift--not just put in a request and cross your fingers that someone would fill in. You could have asked people yourself, offered to switch shifts for cover a shift for them in return, etc. For someone you claim to care so much about, you sound kind of ambivalent about being in her wedding. Especially since I have worked in child-care. It's not really a field that has long-term growth potential unless you own the day care.", "ESH. Being a bridesmaid means giving up a lot of time.  Including before the wedding.  Especially before the wedding.  Heck, I live in the same town as a wedding(s) I was in and had to take the day before off several times!  You have to be there, for everything.  Most brides are a little more understanding and wouldn't ask that you jeopardize work, but you should have already requested that time off.  As for work, I understand that you need to make sure your position is covered, but as a full time employee, there should be some flexibility.  And you should make that happen.", "ESH, Everyone Sucks Here.\n\nShe's going too far with the personal attacks and the demands about everything. At this point your friendship is over so quit worrying about her.\n\nIf your student job (not 'career') is so difficult to get time off from, then you should never have committed to being in the bridal party at all.  You've had months' advance notice and you surely could have figured this out by now, whether it would be begging your boss or paying another worker to take your shift, or whatever.", "NTA...and here's why I think that way\n\nTrue story... When I got engaged, one of the first people I told was my best friend from high school. We were still very close and saw each other a few times a year. I asked her to be my maid of honor. She accepted, but, as time came closer, she realized she wouldn't be able to be there. So, she called me up and bowed out. It was a combination family and work issue that would keep her away. Totally understood and she and I are still very good friends 30 years later. And my sister wound up being my MOH.\n\nThe people who care for you wil understand and accept it when you let them know you're limitations.", "NTA\n\nBut your job sounds like it sucks. You should be able to take days off when you know you have an obligation several months in advance and it should not be on you to get people to cover your shift. That's crappy management and doesn't sound like it's someplace you want to work long-term.\n\nYour friend, however, is an AH for only telling you recently how long in advance she wants you to be there for the wedding. I put some blame on you for not being able to get there on Friday if the wedding is Saturday since it's fairly standard to have a rehearsal dinner the night before a wedding but wanting you there on the Wednesday before is a bit much, especially when she only gave you a couple weeks' notice about that.", "YTA for accepting the commitment of being a bridesmaid and not following through.  Rehearsals are a very routine part of the wedding process. \nEdit: don't jeopardize your job because of it but you should have know what being a bridesmaid meant before accepting.", "NTA, life happens, situations change, and some things end up being out of your control.  It is pretty shitty of her to decide 2 weeks before the wedding that you have to be there on a Wed,  not on the day you previously agreed on.", "Her wedding is, or should be, one day; your job and career are your LIFE! And the minute anyone says, \"If you loved me, you'd...\", it's time to say, you're right, I don't love you enough to jeopardize my entire future for your spectacle. \n\nStay home, learn the lesson.", "NTA\n\n Your future is more important than a wedding.", "Nta - must attend dates should be shared weeks if not months in advance. She can't just demand your presence several days early only a couple weeks out and be upset when you can't make it work. So unless you've known about these dates for months you're not the asshole \n\nIt sounds like she's done you a favour and you don't even have to cancel", "NTA. I was kind of understanding her position when you were starting your OP. Being a bridesmaid is a time commitment and you should attend certain important things, and should plan well in advance for them.\n\nBut she's being unreasonable. You don't need to get there on the Wednesday before a Saturday wedding when you live out of town and have such stringent working conditions. She should be understanding of that. Especially if she sprung this on you last minute. I wanted my bridesmaids there Friday afternoon/evening for the rehearsal and rehearsal dinner and then on Saturday for getting ready/the wedding. This is what I think you should try to make happen but she also needs to be a good friend too and realize that your life doesn't revolve around her wedding.\n\nYour job sucks though and I'm not sure you should make it your career.", "NTA\n\n(insert Tombstone \"Well, bye.\" meme here)", "Make other plans and friends.
