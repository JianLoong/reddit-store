Schools typically have guidelines for teacher/student relationships which is something that you should look into. I worked at schools that policy was no relationship outside of school & teacher/student relationships. Other schools were more lenient (especially in rural areas) so please check that out. You also mentioned that Addison is a new student, but it\u2019s not clear if the father is also a new teacher. Are they new to the area or did dad just recently get custody? If both are new to the area, you need to research how long he\u2019s been teaching & why he left any previous schools. It\u2019s definitely a complicated situation. Other children may start to believe your son is getting preferential treatment from the teacher & give him a hard time.", "The header is deceiving here, but NTA.

Loren isn't spending the weekend at his teacher's house, it's just their friend's house.  Who cares if her friend's Dad is his teacher?  It's weird as hell that you'd have an issue with this.
