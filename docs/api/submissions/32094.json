Schools typically have guidelines for teacher/student relationships which is something that you should look into. I worked at schools that policy was no relationship outside of school & teacher/student relationships. Other schools were more lenient (especially in rural areas) so please check that out. You also mentioned that Addison is a new student, but it\u2019s not clear if the father is also a new teacher. Are they new to the area or did dad just recently get custody? If both are new to the area, you need to research how long he\u2019s been teaching & why he left any previous schools. It\u2019s definitely a complicated situation. Other children may start to believe your son is getting preferential treatment from the teacher & give him a hard time.", "The header is deceiving here, but NTA.

As long as your home is appropriate its not an ethical concern. Your wife is totally overreacting if she has no concerns otherwise about the teacher. \n\nWhen it comes to teachers we have an ethics board exactly for these grey areas, we are expected to use our professional judgment to bend the rules hundreds of times a day at work and then if anyone has an issue we take it to the ethics board to decide. I can tell you 100% the ethics board will not approve of having kids over if a parent thinks harm will happen at the home.

Think of how it would feel if it was switched and your ex insisted on doing something you were uncomfortable with. In the end, ideally you both just have your child\u2019s best interest in mind. While it\u2019s most likely innocent, I can absolutely understand why a sleepover at a teacher\u2019s house could make a parent uneasy (sleepovers anywhere for that matter). Maybe there can be a compromise, like the child still sleeps over if they bring a phone/ipad that the other parent can check in with them, for their own peace of mind.
