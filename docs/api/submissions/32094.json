To add on to everybody else: it would be incredibly terrible if the children of teachers could not be normal childhood friends with their classmates. Obviously you probably don\u2019t put a kid in their parent\u2019s home room class, but there will be at least one year where the kid is in the teacher\u2019s assigned grade (and more if the teacher changes grades upwards). Best to treat the whole year like any other in terms of how everything works.", "So he\u2019s spending time at his friends house which is more important than it coincidentally being his teacher. If concerned ask the teacher what she thinks. Or the principal.", "no, as somebody who was the son of a 4th grade teacher, NTA.

It sounds weird when you say \"his teacher's house\" but knowing that it's his friend's house makes it just a normal sleepover.

By your ex\u2019s logic, Addison doesn\u2019t get to have friends or a normal childhood? Your son is perfectly safe and there\u2019s no weird stigma with it being a teacher\u2019s house. Your ex is being irrational.", "NTA\n\nFrom experience. My best friend in elementary school (2nd through 5th grade) until he moved out of state, his mom was my teacher in 4th grade. \n\nMy best friend in middle school, his mom was my English and then Literature teacher in 6th grade and 8th grade. \n\nI went over to both their houses many many times and my friends came over to mine. No issues whatsoever", "NTA. People forget teachers are people and have families/kids. Your kid found a friend. Great.", "NTA I was going say yeah you are at first. Then I see he wants to go stay with his friend not his teacher.  How lonely Addisons childhood would be if all parents thought like your ex.", "NTA. Do you know how many friends parents were my actual teachers in K-12. It literally made classes more fun. Tbh if anything it made me a better kid growing up. When did we start not trusting teachers.. like we trust them to teach our kids the academic knowledge required for the world but not to watch them overnight.", "NTA-just ensure you are available to pick him up if necessary(and maybe set up a code word to make it your \u201cfault\u201d if he wants to come home.", "Jesus could you imagine if you were never allowed to have friends bc your parent *gasps* is a teacher!", "ESH.

When in I was in junior high/high school I\u2019d go stay with my band teacher and his wife. Did an extended stay with the school superintendent and his big ol\u2019 Mormon fam after my mom got a gnarly back injury. That was wild - we have pioneer Mormon heritage so it was a get to know your ancestral culture kind of homestay which was interesting.\n\nGranted, small town and she was the chair of the school board and was kind of an absent parent \ud83d\ude02 but honestly having safe places to be with adults I trusted and respected made me a better student.", "At home she\u2019s not \u2018the teacher\u2019 she\u2019s a mom.  With kids. Who have sleepovers like everyone else.", "NTA - my parent was a teacher at the same school I attended along with my brother. I\u2019m just trying to imagine how odd it would have been if none of our friends could ever come hang out or sleep over because there was a TEACHER in the house? (Gasp!) Odd. Ex just sounds jealous that you\u2019re being the \u201cfun\u201d parent by allowing this. Maybe a reach, but I wonder if your ex had issues with a teacher in her school days and is projecting onto your son? Hope they have a fun sleepover!", "My mom was a teacher in my school district and had a ton of my friends as students. I would have had a very, very sad childhood if none of my friends could ever sleep over because my mom was their teacher.", "NTA. I grew up in a small town where it was common to have teachers with their own kids, nieces and nephews, and their kids\u2019 friends in their own classes. The child of a teacher would never get to have friends otherwise.", "Nta. It's not like it's just his son and teacher. Teacher son is there.", "Info: what does your custody agreement say? Can you make a unilateral decision like this?", "Info: what does your custody agreement say? Can you make a unilateral decision like this?", "NTA.", "NTA. Your exs mistaken reading of the situation is \"teacher invited kid,\" which would be inappropriate. What happened is \"friend invited friend for sleepover, dad *happens to be* the teacher.\"\n\nIf anything, given the background checks, I'd say your kid is objectively safer having a sleepover at that house than they would be at another friend's.", "I stayed over at the house of 3 school staff at high school; one teacher who was my mates mum, one teacher was my aunt and so was one of the office/admin ladies \ud83e\udd23 I also regularly had dinner at primary school teacher\u2019s house, because she and my mum were close. NTA.", "NTA. Please let Loren & Addison be friends with no weirdness from you. I\u2019m sure Addison already has, and will continue to, experience adults like your ex. Personally I would feel better about my kiddo being at a teacher\u2019s house. They obviously already know your child quite well. It is going to give Loren some wonderful support from an adult he isn\u2019t related to.", "INFO: So just to be clear, your son has been invited over to his mates house for a sleepover, and his mates dad just happens to be your sons teacher?\n\nThere is nothing inappropriate about that at all.", "NTA I am female and when I was in high school my orchestra teacher was a male. I dated his son for 2 years so I was at their house all the time and inevitably spent a lot of time with said teacher outside of school. It wasn\u2019t weird despite me being a female student because I trusted him and outside of school he just was my boyfriend\u2019s dad. As long as you and your son both trust this teacher, there is absolutely no reason to not let him go. The relationship with a teacher outside of school is vastly different from an in-school relationship.", "NTA. But your ex needs to change the narrative on 'staying over at his teacher's house' to 'staying over at his friend's house'. The fact that his friend's dad happens to also be his teacher shouldn't blacklist the kid from having friends. Or is she trying to imply that Loren shouldn't be friends with his teacher's son? Because that's dumb.", "NTA, ask your ex to explain in clear, unambiguous terms why it is \"inappropriate\".", "If anything, unlike random parents, teachers are background checked yearly, go through training on how to treat kids, and have their entire career to lose at just one mistake with a child. Sleepovers in general are risky, with a teacher is probably your safest bet.", "It's wierdm", "YTA. Obviously the school is a close commute for both your child and the teacher. I get that the boys are friends, but It is crazy inappropriate for a teacher to have this personal relationship with a child of 8 or 9. Assuming there is nothing nefarious going on (which I highly doubt but you seem to believe) how can this person be objective regarding your sons grades and progress? Be prepared for legal action from your ex if you are making these types of decisions. Both parents have to agree a situation is safe and your wife is right to be concerned. He\u2019s just too young to sleep out when it isn\u2019t necessary with someone she isn\u2019t comfortable with.", "Absolutely this. A kid shouldn\u2019t be prevented from having friends just because a parent is a teacher.\n\nNTA", "Is Addison never going to have friends over because his mum is a teacher? Bizarre.", "I just commented before I saw your comment, but exactly this. My mom was a teacher in my school district. Many of my closest friends had her as a teacher at some point. I would have had a horribly lonely and sad childhood if none of my friends could ever come over because my mom was their teacher.", "I was in almost a class a year where the teacher had a student in their class.", "One of the kids in my class was the principal's kid. He was still allowed to go to other people's houses and have friends over for sleepovers.", "Exactly, presumably a lot of Addison's friends are currently in his dad's class. That's a state of affairs that will mainly be an issue this year.", "You said was I was going to. This teacher dad has been vetted more than 90% of the other kids parents. And Addison needs to have friends as well.", "As a teacher, I could understand the opposite scenario: not wanting students around after work, but if the teacher is Ok with it and you like the guy, then this is an easy yes. He\u2019s been vetted by the government. It\u2019s a guarantee that he has active first aid and cpr certification and he doesn\u2019t want to ruin the separation of church and state anymore than you do. So\u2026 NTA", "If that were true, one kid I went to school with (he was a year younger)  *never* would've had friends, much less be as well-liked and popular as he was.  Was a genuinely nice, humble guy.  Both his parents were high school math teachers. (His mom was an awesome advisor for a club I was in and one of those teachers that current and former students adored.  Hell of a math teacher too.)", "So in your eyes, because childhood sexual abuse exists you just shouldn't let your children have sleepovers?", "You are an idiot.", "Username checks out", "It's the dad.", "It\u2019s the kids best friend. Who cares who the parent is as long as it is a safe environment. You gonna tell your kid they cant do normal kid things with their friend because their parent happens to be their teacher? Both my parent are teachers and I grew up around all other teachers and their kids. Outside of school they are just normal ass people.", "So a teacher\u2019s child isn\u2019t allowed to have friends?  Are you saying these things because the teacher is male?  These are sort of rhetorical questions, but do think about them.", "Is the teachers kid not allowed to have friends??? wtf", "Get help.", "The teacher doesn't have a relationship - the kids do.\n\nYou're essentially arguing that Addison can't ever have school friends over, which is insane.\n\nThere's no reason to assume anything nefarious is going on at all. Lots of teachers have their kids in the same school they teach in and those kids have friends and want to do normal friend things like sleepovers.", "The teacher doesn't have a personal relationship with the child, his child has a personal relationship with the child. If you think something inappropriate is going to happen at this sleepover just because he's his teacher, then why wouldn't you think that something inappropriate would happen at any sleepover? Do you think 3rd graders just shouldn't have sleepovers?", "Dad. The dad is the teacher.", "A friend of mine grew up in a *very* small farming community. Her mom taught sex ed at the local high school, and since she was the only sex ed teacher, all three of her kids had to take her class. It was awkward for everyone.", "The child\u2019s Mom is not comfortable - end of argument. She cares who the parent is. No one knows if its a safe environment and I wouldn\u2019t let my 3rd grader be the test case. At a later age, sure, maybe 6th grade when kids have a better idea of boundaries, not 3rd grade where the adult, who always has an upper hand, is a teacher with whom the child has trust. OP doesn\u2019t mention how well HE knows the teacher at all. If you\u2019ve never heard of anyone who was molested by a friend\u2019s parent, you haven\u2019t lived long enough.", "My parents were teacher and I'm the 90s growing up sleep overs were allowed", "And Dad is. Not like she can veto. She doesn\u2019t get some extra power by being the mom. And we have no story on the type of people either parent are and what condition their relationship is in as they are not together. Not like she\u2019s worried about safety from what we were told. Just weirded out by it being the teachers house.", "Either parent can Veto a plan that involves child safety, especially for a 3rd grader. No judge will allow that sleeping over to go on for long. There is no reason the kids can\u2019t just go to the event without the sleepover. Anyway, good luck OP. Your son has his whole life to do sleepovers. There\u2019s no need to start at 9, especially where his Mom does not want it. Not a hill I\u2019d want to die on but\u2026", "But again there is no safety argument here and a Judge is going to see a parent that is a professional that works with children, fairly safe environment unless there is something not disclosed. Mother just thinks it is bizarre and inappropriate, has no actual grounds.", "That is literally not how custody agreements work. At all.", "You don\u2019t know anything about custody agreements and it really shows. It\u2019s dads time to have the kid, what he says goes unless it\u2019s specifically stated in the custody agreement. Which it isn\u2019t.", "How does this affect the child\u2019s safety? Teachers have to get police checks and child intervention checks done.  He works with children. How is this unsafe?", "You have some serious mental health problems, mate. You need to seek therapy instead of projecting your own thoughts and insecurities onto others..."]}
