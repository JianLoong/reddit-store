I feel like an ass since I didn't react with joy like everyone else but I honestly can't support their decision.\n\nThey've only been married for a couple of years so there was plenty of time for them to settle down and have kids, in my opinion, but my friend has always had \"baby fever.\" I'm mainly concerned about their ability to be parents. They both work full-time and when they get home they complain they are \"too tired\" to take care of stuff around the house: cooking, cleaning, etc. They eat out every night because my friend doesn't know how to cook and her husband just doesn't want to. Their house is always messy between dishes, laundry, and general filth.\n\nThey also have poor money management skills, always shopping for stuff they just see and want but don't need rather than buying stuff like groceries to cook actual meals. They've struggled to pay rent a few times because of this. In addition, their house is incredibly small, overflowing with stuff and not a safe environment for a baby. (It's very old and has a lot issues.) Realistically, how do you expect to take care of a baby with habits like that and in a space that isn't suited for them?\n\nWhen I expressed these concerns to my friends, they essentially told me I shouldn't worry about it because \"nobody is ever prepared to have a baby\" and that I should just be happy for them. I get that you're never *really* prepared but you can have a game plan, right? Start saving and making sure you have the stuff and space required? How nonchalant they were about my concerns made me even more anxious; you'd think I was having the baby.\n\nYesterday the topic came up again and my friend asked me if I had changed my mind about it and when I told her no, she was grated. I also learned they are now trying to rush a move to get to a bigger and better house even though she's halfway through her second trimester. She starting getting defensive, saying that just because I don't really want kids of my own that I was trying to \"bring her down,\" and that I should just support her pregnancy rather than being concerned about \"future problems.\" \n\nI told her that she and her husband were too caught in elation to see the reality that being a parent isn't just about cute baby clothes and being a friend to your child. I did get snippy, which I shouldn't have done, but it felt like she was just brushing away what I consider valid concerns. I did eventually apologize, saying, \"I'm sorry you feel that way but I don't think I'm unjustified here,\" which didn't go well because it wasn't a \"real\" apology. Not one she wanted to hear, at least. I just can't bring myself to believe they are responsible or mature enough to have a baby and that makes me feel like a bad friend. \n\nSo, AITA for telling them they're not ready to have a baby and should have waited until they got their lives together?\n\nEdit: Since a lot of people are saying the same thing, I *have* expressed these concerns before, many times, prior to my friend actually becoming pregnant. It wasn't unsolicited, she would ask my opinion and I would tell her these things each time.", "created_utc": 1690143205, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157oy9h/aita_for_telling_my_friends_they_arent_ready_for/", "score": 160, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They\u2019re already having a baby and your crappy comments aren\u2019t supportive. Your friend is right in that no one is ever really prepared for the life alteration of a baby.

What do you expect? Are you suggesting they should terminate?   \n\nYou gotta understand, once something already happened, it\u2019s done and they have to live with the consequences.

Have your mama ever told you if you can\u2019t say anything nice say nothing at all? You sound judge mental as heck. This is their journey to figure out. Most children are not born under ideal conditions and do perfectly fine.", "I understand why you'd think that and that you had good intentions telling them but YTA.

You're far too judgmental and self righteous, it's a wonder you have friends at all.", "You are 100 percent, unequivocally the AH.\nYour entire justification is spoken clearly as someone who doesn't have kids. You have no idea what you're talking about and are projecting your assumptions of what is needed preparation wise to be able to raise a child. Some people (alot of people) learn many of these skills (cooking, cleaning, money mgmt) once they have kids out of necessity. They have been married for two years, and are in their late 20s. That puts them leaps and bounds ahead of many parents, stability-wise. As long as their marriage is stable and they love their child they should do just fine.", "YTA.

So you might as well say congratulations and move on.", "YTA I'm afraid. If they're already expecting and telling people then it's too late for this conversation to be useful. I understand why you're not thrilled and I think your concerns are valid, but a more tactful and helpful approach would have been to subtly raise a couple of specific issues, e.g. \"Ooh I imagine you're having to cut down on luxuries with a baby on the way, let's meet at yours for lunch instead of the shopping centre\" with the implied undertone of stop buying stuff you don't need because babies are expensive.", "YTA. Mind your business.", "None of your business. YTA", "Anyone who says \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" is usually TA.

That said though, the time to express your apprehension to your friends would have been BEFORE they got pregnant, not AFTER. Airing apprehensions to a person in their second trimester of pregnancy does nothing to help at all, and if you're truly so concerned about your friends' child (as it does seem like you're investing a lot of worry into the situation), it'd probably be better to offer them helpful advice instead of poo-pooing on how unprepared and ill-fitted you think they are for parenthood.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s their life and their choice. You don\u2019t have to be perfect to be a parent. The fact that you\u2019re being judgy over even the simple fact that they\u2019re 26 and have been married over a year (which is a pretty standard time to have a baby) should be a big red flag to you.\n\nWhy do you think it\u2019s your business that they want to move while she is in her second trimester? What grievous harm do you think this is going to do to the fetus?", "I can see your point that they do need clean up their habits that they can start doing now during the pregnancy so I disagree with people saying it\u2019s too late in that aspect habit wise. But you mentioned they had a small space and are now moving into a bigger house second trimester in is totally ok. Women are allowed to work up until 36 weeks of pregnancy im sure she\u2019s being mindful and not doing much heavy lifting. But moving into a bigger house already sounds like they understand they need a bigger space so what\u2019s the issue here? Yes you are TA for telling them they should have waited until they got their lives together because getting your entire life together can take years it depends. Telling a pregnant women she\u2019s not ready to be a mom as her best friend is pretty shitty imo. But I promise you, having kids gives you motivation you didn\u2019t know you had. Everything you do, you start doing for your kids. You start to want to become a better person and role model for your kids. You will see once your best friend has that baby, she\u2019s going to change for the better because of that baby and you\u2019re going to feel really shitty for not being as supportive and positive from the beginning.", "YTA, they are *already pregnant* and you are choosing now to tell them you don't think they are ready? Too little, too late, friend. It's happening. What you need to do is be supportive of them and make helpful suggestions, or better yet offer to help them in whatever ways they need. It doesn't matter if you \"support\" their decision to have kids or not, it is happening.", "YTA. If she was asking before she was pregnant, that's one thing. But what's she supposed to do now?\n\nI had a super unstable friend get pregnant with a one-night stand. I was very nervous for her because she didn't seem ready. Now her daughter is 3.5 and my friend is on a good path. She says her daughter is the best thing that ever happened to her. MYOB", "YTA. \n\nYour concern is touching but the way you broached the subject and your reasons for it aren\u2019t really all that justified. It sounds more like you may have unresolved trauma that you\u2019re pushing onto your friend. Or perhaps just your own personal issues with anxiety. Either way, this is not your friend\u2019s problem and in no way means they aren\u2019t ready for kids. \n\nWe moved into a bigger house when I was 28 weeks pregnant in my 3rd trimester. I have an autoimmune disease and don\u2019t always feel like cooking or cleaning myself. But now that my baby is almost a year old, I can say that she always has meals prepared for her, she always has a clean place to play and sleep, she always has clean laundry, and all of her bottles and dishes are always cleaned. \n\nI may not have the energy to do these things for myself, but I always make sure I have the energy to do them for her. My husband as well. \n\nThey\u2019re having a baby. Now is the time to be supportive if you want to still be in here life, not critical and judgmental. If your anxiety gets the better of you and you can\u2019t shake the feeling, then redirect it into something productive and positive. Offer to go over and help with dishes once in a while. Offer to help with laundry. Drop off casseroles every now and then.  When the baby gets older and is trying solids, drop baby safe pur\u00e9es and meals. That\u2019s how you can manage your anxiety if you want to, not by being insensitive and rude to your friend. You\u2019re preaching when it probably isn\u2019t necessary.", "YTA. People can and do change when they have children. Why are you so invested in proving a point, especially since they\u2019ve already decided this is what they want?", "\u2018Hey the environment the child is being brought into isn\u2019t suitable nor safe, so let\u2019s just shut up about it.\u2019 \n\nJfc\n\nif I were OP I would\u2019ve been honest myself. If my friends take offense and can\u2019t realize that babies are a lifelong commitment that you can\u2019t return to the pound because you realize how hard it is, that\u2019s recipe for CPS. \n\nIf they didn\u2019t clean up their act, I would make a report of the environment and ask they get assistance to get on track. Because that\u2019s what I did when it came to my mom. \n\nThat child will either develop an eating disorder, obesity, learn to hoard, and be unable to gain financial independence or even struggle to have bare necessities available. \n\nI had an upbringing similar to this. And my mom was warned as OP had done, and she said she\u2019s got it under control. \n\nShe struggled well after i was born but even at toddler age had I started suffering the consequences. I wasn\u2019t fed properly so I was eating literal bugs from the wild as snacks. \n\nI never had my own \u2018space\u2019 because of the amount of boxes my mom kept around*. I struggled to eat at school because she didn\u2019t have money to pay my lunch fees from elementary to high school. My aunt had to literally send her daughters w extra food for me and my uncles would give me cash on the side for shoes or clothes because even when I had holes in them, my mom never replaced them. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I moved out due to the state of the home did she start throwing out the useless crap and save enough money. I wish someone had tried harder because then I would\u2019ve had my own room and not just my own bed in my moms room. Or struggle w an ED at 21.", "Might be against the grain but NTA. You're not saying anything outrageous or intentionally spiteful, just being realistic.

Ready or not, baby is coming. Do you want them to get an abortion or put their baby up for adoption? Being a friend means you just offer support where you can. Just telling them they're not ready is unhelpful.", "I'm going against the grain here to say ESH. She asked and were honest and she didn't like your opinion. But you didn't need to be so mean about it either. That baby is coming and if you're as concerned as you say maybe you should try to help them prepare. Be supportive when you bring these concerns to your friend not judgemental. Because I guarantee based on her reaction the judgment isn't going to help her change. I needed this type of help and support as well, but my friend gave it me as support not judgement.", "YTA. As you stated, you and your friend have talked about this MANY times. You have told her you don\u2019t think she should have kids MANY times. Now she\u2019s having one. You can seriously stfu about it now. You\u2019ve made your opinion more than clear. Every concern you mentioned is common stuff among DINKs in their 20s. Shit changes.

Then OP is posting on the CPS subreddit about whether or not to get CPS involved. How do I know? I've been OP. I had a friend that wanted a baby seemingly as an accessory.

Perhaps logical based on your previous discussions but not guaranteed.  Oopsies happen far too often as we all know.  \n2) you assume they could afford or access \"options\" to not have a child.  That's becoming a rare, dangerous and expensive endeavor.  \n3) all of your concerns list things that YOU think aren't good enough. YOU think the house is too old. You think it has too many issues.  You think it's cluttered or unsafe-as if they don't have an entire year to baby-safe it. It's all your opinions about her life and how they live it.  Clearly, they don't see an issue with it, and you do. I'm guessing code enforcement, the health department, and CPS won't care either so it's again really your opinion. If it's that bad now, why wait to call?   So the question is, is your friendship still compatible?

Neither is their finances.", "Girl...you are wasting your breath.  Hush up and just wait to take photos of it all happening.", "YTA - it\u2019s none of your business.  Sounds like no matter what they do, or how they do it, you\u2019re just going to judge them anyway. If you can be happy for them and keep quiet, then maybe you should expect to have to find new friends.", "NTA some people need reality checks and a child being born to two people who arent prepared is a huge disservice and detriment to the kid. Hopefully they'll listen to ur advice and get their shit together for how their lives are going to drastically and permanently change when they have a whole human dependent entirely on them", "YTA. Your points are all valid concerns and I can understand that they come from a place of caring for these people.

If you value having a relationship with these people beyond this point, it\u2019s time to offer support in whatever way that you can, even if it\u2019s only in good vibes. Nit-picking them now and in the future is not going to help them in any way, and it\u2019s going to sour whatever relationship you guys have even further.\n\nSuck up your holier-than-thou attitude and take a backseat. You don\u2019t control their lives; you\u2019re just a part of it.

Yes you are the asshole. Especially after putting \"real apology\" in quotes when that definitely wasnt a real apology, saying \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" is actually really rude and the opposite of an apology, you are basically saying that you don't care about how they feel. A real apology sounds like \"I'm sorry I made you feel that way\" or \"I apologize I really do\" At the end of the day, its her life her body her choice, nothing you do will change the fact that she's already pregnant.

I moved into my home July 1st and had my son at the end of September, and I'm so glad I did it that way. The nesting you experience during your 3rd trimester is unreal. I was more motivated to do housework than I'd ever been in my life and had all my belongings unpacked within a week and also slapped a fresh coat of paint (zero VOC) in several rooms even while working a full-time job.

These people clearly want and love this child, they will figure it out like any parent does. You saying you don't support them is not helpful at all.

You admit you yourself don't even know what to do, so it's probably time to stop throwing stones at them and try to be a supportive friend.", "So what exactly is your point? Whether OP is right in her sentiments or not isn't what's up for debate here. This baby is coming whether any of us like it or not. Telling the friend she is going to be a shit mom does not do anything to help the situation.", "Good deal! You can totally make this right. Happy to hear you are making amends and doing the right thing. Friendship is so valuable and I think you know that, good luck OP.", "You don't even need to apologize, I promise they will reach out for help when they are desperate.", "Ah my bad. Wasn\u2019t tryna be snarky. I see what you\u2019re saying tho.", "It wasn't then that I was specifically referring to, more so when she was 24 after they got married. I was just using that a an example of how many times we've had this conversation. I do want to be supportive, so I need to do better and apologize properly, yes.", "That I agree with. I was simply disagreeing with your assertion that they would figure it out. I actually agree with OP; I don\u2019t think they will. The impulse purchasing is unlikely to stop because of a child; it\u2019s similar to a gambling addiction in many ways, and those get worse with stress - and children are always a stress.\n\nThat said, OP should keep her opinions to herself now, as they\u2019re no longer of use. If her friend is willing to listen and ASKS, then OP could offer to help her budget. Otherwise, OP should just try to remain as supportive as possible or, if she is unable to do so, distance herself from the situation entirely.", "There's things I have offered to help her with like teaching her to cook and plan meals better and that made her happy. I do want to help her because I love her very much and if she wants the help doing other things I will do so.", "My suggestion: stop offering and stop critiquing. Just be supportive. Put on a smile and tell her you\u2019re happy for her. Help if she asks, but don\u2019t offer if she doesn\u2019t. \n\nShe clearly doesn\u2019t want honesty right now, but support. She also obviously does not want your help or advice. So let it be. If she needs help, she knows where to go. But right now she just needs a supportive friend.", "You say you love her very much, but from your description, you also seem to see her as sort of a disaster of a human who can't possibly (by your estimation) be ready to parent a child.\n\n1. Who made you the judge of who is and isn't ready to be a parent? Answer: nobody. That's not your job.\n\n2. Who likes to be told by their friend that their house is a mess and their cooking sucks? Nobody. Stop it.\n\n3. Who wants to be friends with someone who *clearly* thinks they're doing better at life than you are? \nAgain....nobody. You are coming across as judgemental, condescending, and arrogant.\n\nAnd you may be perfectly right about their house, their food, and their parental preparedness! But it is *not your mess to fix*. Unless there is something that rises to the level of abuse or neglect (rampant heparin use, a house full of cat turds, etc), kindly be a friend (ie supportive, happy for them) or butt out. YTA."]}
