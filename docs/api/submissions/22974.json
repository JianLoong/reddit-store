I feel like an ass since I didn't react with joy like everyone else but I honestly can't support their decision.\n\nThey've only been married for a couple of years so there was plenty of time for them to settle down and have kids, in my opinion, but my friend has always had \"baby fever.\" I'm mainly concerned about their ability to be parents. They both work full-time and when they get home they complain they are \"too tired\" to take care of stuff around the house: cooking, cleaning, etc. They eat out every night because my friend doesn't know how to cook and her husband just doesn't want to. Their house is always messy between dishes, laundry, and general filth.\n\nThey also have poor money management skills, always shopping for stuff they just see and want but don't need rather than buying stuff like groceries to cook actual meals. They've struggled to pay rent a few times because of this. In addition, their house is incredibly small, overflowing with stuff and not a safe environment for a baby. (It's very old and has a lot issues.) Realistically, how do you expect to take care of a baby with habits like that and in a space that isn't suited for them?\n\nWhen I expressed these concerns to my friends, they essentially told me I shouldn't worry about it because \"nobody is ever prepared to have a baby\" and that I should just be happy for them. I get that you're never *really* prepared but you can have a game plan, right? Start saving and making sure you have the stuff and space required? How nonchalant they were about my concerns made me even more anxious; you'd think I was having the baby.\n\nYesterday the topic came up again and my friend asked me if I had changed my mind about it and when I told her no, she was grated. I also learned they are now trying to rush a move to get to a bigger and better house even though she's halfway through her second trimester. She starting getting defensive, saying that just because I don't really want kids of my own that I was trying to \"bring her down,\" and that I should just support her pregnancy rather than being concerned about \"future problems.\" \n\nI told her that she and her husband were too caught in elation to see the reality that being a parent isn't just about cute baby clothes and being a friend to your child. I did get snippy, which I shouldn't have done, but it felt like she was just brushing away what I consider valid concerns. I did eventually apologize, saying, \"I'm sorry you feel that way but I don't think I'm unjustified here,\" which didn't go well because it wasn't a \"real\" apology. Not one she wanted to hear, at least. I just can't bring myself to believe they are responsible or mature enough to have a baby and that makes me feel like a bad friend. \n\nSo, AITA for telling them they're not ready to have a baby and should have waited until they got their lives together?\n\nEdit: Since a lot of people are saying the same thing, I *have* expressed these concerns before, many times, prior to my friend actually becoming pregnant. It wasn't unsolicited, she would ask my opinion and I would tell her these things each time.\n\nUpdate: I was an asshole. I overstepped my boundaries and hurt people I care about, no excuses. I consider myself very fortunate that my friend answered my text message and agreed to see me. She's allowed me to go over to her house tomorrow so that I may properly apologize to her and her husband. I do not expect them to forgive and forget but I would like to tell them I'm sorry.", "created_utc": 1690143205, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157oy9h/aita_for_telling_my_friends_they_arent_ready_for/", "score": 2890, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Expressing your opinion now is worthless and only delivers hurt. YTA", "Trust me, I understand your instincts.

What do you expect? Are you suggesting they should terminate?   \n\nYou gotta understand, once something already happened, it\u2019s done and they have to live with the consequences.

You have no idea what you're talking about and are projecting your assumptions of what is needed preparation wise to be able to raise a child.

That puts them leaps and bounds ahead of many parents, stability-wise. As long as their marriage is stable and they love their child they should do just fine.", "YTA.

So you might as well say congratulations and move on.", "YTA I'm afraid. If they're already expecting and telling people then it's too late for this conversation to be useful. I understand why you're not thrilled and I think your concerns are valid, but a more tactful and helpful approach would have been to subtly raise a couple of specific issues, e.g. \"Ooh I imagine you're having to cut down on luxuries with a baby on the way, let's meet at yours for lunch instead of the shopping centre\" with the implied undertone of stop buying stuff you don't need because babies are expensive.", "YTA. Mind your business.", "None of your business. YTA", "Anyone who says \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" is usually TA. YTA, OP.\n\nI get it, believe me, I do- I quite often see people having kids when it's apparent that they were in no good place to do so. That said though, the time to express your apprehension to your friends would have been BEFORE they got pregnant, not AFTER. Airing apprehensions to a person in their second trimester of pregnancy does nothing to help at all, and if you're truly so concerned about your friends' child (as it does seem like you're investing a lot of worry into the situation), it'd probably be better to offer them helpful advice instead of poo-pooing on how unprepared and ill-fitted you think they are for parenthood.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s their life and their choice. You don\u2019t have to be perfect to be a parent. The fact that you\u2019re being judgy over even the simple fact that they\u2019re 26 and have been married over a year (which is a pretty standard time to have a baby) should be a big red flag to you.\n\nWhy do you think it\u2019s your business that they want to move while she is in her second trimester? What grievous harm do you think this is going to do to the fetus?", "I can see your point that they do need clean up their habits that they can start doing now during the pregnancy so I disagree with people saying it\u2019s too late in that aspect habit wise. But you mentioned they had a small space and are now moving into a bigger house second trimester in is totally ok. Women are allowed to work up until 36 weeks of pregnancy im sure she\u2019s being mindful and not doing much heavy lifting. But moving into a bigger house already sounds like they understand they need a bigger space so what\u2019s the issue here? Yes you are TA for telling them they should have waited until they got their lives together because getting your entire life together can take years it depends. Telling a pregnant women she\u2019s not ready to be a mom as her best friend is pretty shitty imo. But I promise you, having kids gives you motivation you didn\u2019t know you had. Everything you do, you start doing for your kids. You start to want to become a better person and role model for your kids. You will see once your best friend has that baby, she\u2019s going to change for the better because of that baby and you\u2019re going to feel really shitty for not being as supportive and positive from the beginning.", "YTA, they are *already pregnant* and you are choosing now to tell them you don't think they are ready? Too little, too late, friend. It's happening. What you need to do is be supportive of them and make helpful suggestions, or better yet offer to help them in whatever ways they need. It doesn't matter if you \"support\" their decision to have kids or not, it is happening.", "YTA. If she was asking before she was pregnant, that's one thing. But what's she supposed to do now?\n\nI had a super unstable friend get pregnant with a one-night stand. I was very nervous for her because she didn't seem ready. Now her daughter is 3.5 and my friend is on a good path. She says her daughter is the best thing that ever happened to her. MYOB", "YTA. \n\nYour concern is touching but the way you broached the subject and your reasons for it aren\u2019t really all that justified. It sounds more like you may have unresolved trauma that you\u2019re pushing onto your friend. Or perhaps just your own personal issues with anxiety. Either way, this is not your friend\u2019s problem and in no way means they aren\u2019t ready for kids. \n\nWe moved into a bigger house when I was 28 weeks pregnant in my 3rd trimester. I have an autoimmune disease and don\u2019t always feel like cooking or cleaning myself. But now that my baby is almost a year old, I can say that she always has meals prepared for her, she always has a clean place to play and sleep, she always has clean laundry, and all of her bottles and dishes are always cleaned. \n\nI may not have the energy to do these things for myself, but I always make sure I have the energy to do them for her. My husband as well. \n\nThey\u2019re having a baby. Now is the time to be supportive if you want to still be in here life, not critical and judgmental. If your anxiety gets the better of you and you can\u2019t shake the feeling, then redirect it into something productive and positive. Offer to go over and help with dishes once in a while. Offer to help with laundry. Drop off casseroles every now and then.  When the baby gets older and is trying solids, drop baby safe pur\u00e9es and meals. That\u2019s how you can manage your anxiety if you want to, not by being insensitive and rude to your friend. You\u2019re preaching when it probably isn\u2019t necessary.", "YTA. People can and do change when they have children. Why are you so invested in proving a point, especially since they\u2019ve already decided this is what they want?", "\u2018Hey the environment the child is being brought into isn\u2019t suitable nor safe, so let\u2019s just shut up about it.\u2019 \n\nJfc\n\nif I were OP I would\u2019ve been honest myself. If my friends take offense and can\u2019t realize that babies are a lifelong commitment that you can\u2019t return to the pound because you realize how hard it is, that\u2019s recipe for CPS. \n\nIf they didn\u2019t clean up their act, I would make a report of the environment and ask they get assistance to get on track. Because that\u2019s what I did when it came to my mom. \n\nThat child will either develop an eating disorder, obesity, learn to hoard, and be unable to gain financial independence or even struggle to have bare necessities available. \n\nI had an upbringing similar to this. And my mom was warned as OP had done, and she said she\u2019s got it under control. \n\nShe struggled well after i was born but even at toddler age had I started suffering the consequences. I wasn\u2019t fed properly so I was eating literal bugs from the wild as snacks. \n\nI never had my own \u2018space\u2019 because of the amount of boxes my mom kept around*. I struggled to eat at school because she didn\u2019t have money to pay my lunch fees from elementary to high school. My aunt had to literally send her daughters w extra food for me and my uncles would give me cash on the side for shoes or clothes because even when I had holes in them, my mom never replaced them. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I moved out due to the state of the home did she start throwing out the useless crap and save enough money. I wish someone had tried harder because then I would\u2019ve had my own room and not just my own bed in my moms room. Or struggle w an ED at 21.", "Might be against the grain but NTA.

Ready or not, baby is coming. Do you want them to get an abortion or put their baby up for adoption? Being a friend means you just offer support where you can. Just telling them they're not ready is unhelpful.", "I'm going against the grain here to say ESH. She asked and were honest and she didn't like your opinion. But you didn't need to be so mean about it either. That baby is coming and if you're as concerned as you say maybe you should try to help them prepare. Be supportive when you bring these concerns to your friend not judgemental. Because I guarantee based on her reaction the judgment isn't going to help her change. I needed this type of help and support as well, but my friend gave it me as support not judgement.", "YTA. As you stated, you and your friend have talked about this MANY times. You have told her you don\u2019t think she should have kids MANY times. Now she\u2019s having one. You can seriously stfu about it now. You\u2019ve made your opinion more than clear. Every concern you mentioned is common stuff among DINKs in their 20s. Shit changes. You\u2019re basically guaranteeing the end of your friendship at this point, which is unfortunate considering you have been friends with this woman for two decades.", "So everyone thinks OP us the AH, but what about when her concerns go from concern to reality. Then OP is posting on the CPS subreddit about whether or not to get CPS involved. How do I know? I've been OP. I had a friend that wanted a baby seemingly as an accessory.

I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s their fault, but I am saying I wasn\u2019t the only person who knew what their home life was like and wondered if it was a contributing cause\u2026 \n\nDo they make meal prep kits for babies and toddlers? Yea. They do. But they\u2019re extremely expensive. Can she just breast feed the baby for a couple years? Yes but some women can\u2019t produce much milk, and some don\u2019t want that extra 24/7 job. Formula right now is $13 a bottle. Those cans of formula are around $52. Babies go through them like no tomorrow. Diapers at Costco are $50 a box. Oh they both work???? Daycare! Daycare is insanely expensive.

It doesn\u2019t sound like they were ready, but they\u2019re pretty far along so it is what it is at this point and they just have to adapt and work through one of the biggest relationship testers ever.", "YTA.

Perhaps logical based on your previous discussions but not guaranteed.  Oopsies happen far too often as we all know.  \n2) you assume they could afford or access \"options\" to not have a child.  That's becoming a rare, dangerous and expensive endeavor.  \n3) all of your concerns list things that YOU think aren't good enough. YOU think the house is too old. You think it has too many issues.  You think it's cluttered or unsafe-as if they don't have an entire year to baby-safe it. It's all your opinions about her life and how they live it.  Clearly, they don't see an issue with it, and you do. I'm guessing code enforcement, the health department, and CPS won't care either so it's again really your opinion. If it's that bad now, why wait to call?   So the question is, is your friendship still compatible?

If you can be happy for them and keep quiet, then maybe you should expect to have to find new friends.", "NTA some people need reality checks and a child being born to two people who arent prepared is a huge disservice and detriment to the kid.

Your points are all valid concerns and I can understand that they come from a place of caring for these people. I have known similar people and watched them have similar (predictable) struggles post-baby.\n\nNevertheless, they *are* pregnant and she is going to give birth in ~3 months. If you value having a relationship with these people beyond this point, it\u2019s time to offer support in whatever way that you can, even if it\u2019s only in good vibes. Nit-picking them now and in the future is not going to help them in any way, and it\u2019s going to sour whatever relationship you guys have even further.\n\nSuck up your holier-than-thou attitude and take a backseat. You don\u2019t control their lives; you\u2019re just a part of it.

Yes you are the asshole. Especially after putting \"real apology\" in quotes when that definitely wasnt a real apology, saying \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" is actually really rude and the opposite of an apology, you are basically saying that you don't care about how they feel. A real apology sounds like \"I'm sorry I made you feel that way\" or \"I apologize I really do\" At the end of the day, its her life her body her choice, nothing you do will change the fact that she's already pregnant.

Continuing to warn them now just ensures they won\u2019t feel they can be honest with you when it\u2019s hard \u2014 and the reality is that parenting is hard no matter how prepared you are.

I moved into my home July 1st and had my son at the end of September, and I'm so glad I did it that way. The nesting you experience during your 3rd trimester is unreal. I was more motivated to do housework than I'd ever been in my life and had all my belongings unpacked within a week and also slapped a fresh coat of paint (zero VOC) in several rooms even while working a full-time job.

Use some type of birth control too, because at that age it\u2019s not a surprise. You knew what it would lead to, or could easily. Get real. It\u2019s selfish to keep the child. Literally the most selfish choice they could make. I\u2019ve def talked my friends into abortions in HS. For sure. It was the right choice at the time.

A baby is just going to magically fix everything. \n\nBabies aren\u2019t free, and even if you have a baby shower and your friends and family buy everything for you, it\u2019s STILL crazy expensive. Constant diapers ($50 a box at Costco) formula (if you can get it) comes in a bottle for $13, a can for $52. They go though all those things very very quickly. This isn\u2019t including pregnancy related bills, even with great insurance I still paid $4k in medical shit but the original cost was around $14k if I didn\u2019t have any insurance. Most people don\u2019t have 4 grand just lying around and if they\u2019re struggling for rent\u2026 get real. Also if they can\u2019t afford rent always, it\u2019s going to be super fun for them to rush back to work and have to find childcare for said child. Daycare is expensive as fuck. Relying on your friends and family for help doesn\u2019t last forever. This is another major cost. \n\nBeyond the costs let\u2019s talk about sleep deprivation. They both work full time jobs and come home exhausted. That form of exhaustion doesn\u2019t even begin to compare to the kind while you\u2019re in the hospital after giving labor and having your child. From that moment on that\u2019s it. You\u2019re it\u2019s everything and you have to feed them every 2-3 hours. That lasts for like 4 months. And if you breast feed it\u2019s a 24/7 job. Those first few months you\u2019re waking up every couple hours and NEVER getting good sleep. Even if family help you and the baby is formula fed you aren\u2019t sleeping well or consistently. \n\nEven if her husband is taking shifts or they split the work load of the baby, I promise you it takes it\u2019s toll on BOTH parties. This is why we have a lot of single mothers. A lot of men leave during this period of the child\u2019s life. \n\nSo it\u2019s like yeah. Dreams are just dreams.

I used to be really awful about cleaning. I stepped up/learned/taught myself how to clean when I had my baby. How do you know they won't?\n\n>They eat out every night because my friend doesn't know how to cook and her husband just doesn't want to.\n\nYeah well, sometimes cooking sucks and not everyone likes to do it. No one taught me to cook before I moved out, and I figured it out when I needed to. And many tired parents of babies take advantage of food you don't need to spend time cooking.\n\n>Their house is always messy between dishes, laundry, and general filth.\n\nYou would have \\*fainted\\* if you saw my BIL and SIL's place before/during/after her pregnancy.

So close.\n\nIf you are so worried about their ability to be parents and the healthy/safety of this baby, what are you \\*actually\\* doing to help other than being judgmental?

After her reaction with my first pregnancy, I didn\u2019t want to tell her about the second. We worked at the same place and socialized with the same people, so she was bound to learn. I hatched a plan with a friend to tell this other one when lots of people were present. It was very helpful. This same woman begged me to stay with my abusive ex\u201dfor the children \u201c.  I laughed at her and basically told her to f*ck off. It was the last conversation we had. \n\nYou remind me of her.", "YTA. I agree they may not be fully ready for a kid, but nobody ever is. You didn't need to list off everything they should have done or what's wrong. Maybe just ask if they need help with anything? They've probably discussed it as a couple already.

If you really think your friend will have such a difficult transition to parenthood, maybe get behind them and find a way to support her. Your words aren\u2019t helping, but you can still turn it around and really help if that was ever your intention.

Stupid people shouldn't be populating the planet even more than it already is. Being unprepared reeks of privilege, ignorance, and irresponsibility. They wouldn't have my support and I'd stop being friends with them if they're willing to put a baby's life in limbo because they were in love with the \"idea\"  of it all but accepted none of the responsibility or preparation. \n\nEdit to add more: You spoke truth and fact based on historical realistic evidence that she didn't like to hear and you don't need to be blindly loyal to her like some people are expecting. Not calling friends out on bad choices is how bad traits gets passed on to children, but you CAN choose to support your friend in the future with the baby.", "I\u2019m honestly shocked by all the comments saying they\u2019re the asshole.

How are they going to pay for daycare / SAHP , baby food, clothes, toys, doctors visits, etc? These are things you plan BEFORE you have a ticking clock.\n\nBut they're upset when you pointed that out after they asked for your opinion. Sounds like she was looking for platitudes not facts.

If you can\u2019t support financially, spend time with the baby, and overall take care of the baby then what makes you think you should have one.

It came off poorly, sure, but if everyone is afraid to tell the truth to their FRIENDS then are you really friends? Maybe sit down with her and teach her how to budget. Do you you know any quick easy meals to make you can share with them?\n\nIt\u2019s ok to be frank with your friends but it\u2019s also important to support them.

I do think you seem like a very caring friend and want them to make good decisions but at this point they\u2019re not going to listen because everything is happening.\n\nOne of the good things I\u2019ve heard about having a baby is it does make you grow up like mature in that sense, and hopefully that will happen for them and that would be wonderful.

Real friends are honest with each other.", "YTA. You have your feelings about it and that's fine. Whatever.

So I should stop my chiding and just support them in making things as good as they can be.\"\n\nThere is a similar situation if you are going out to dinner with somebody, and you tell them that they should change their outfit, because it's too fancy for the place you are going and they will feel uncomfortable/not fit in.  If your friend disregards your advice and wears the outfit anyway, do you continue the evening chiding them for their choice and pointing out to them every chance you get that they stick out?  Or do you just shrug and consider it to be their decision?  What's done is done.  Trying to make somebody feel bad about it, even if it WAS a mistake, is an AH move.  We all make mistakes.

Everyone saying YTA is just focusing on the couple's feelings and ignoring the reality of what this baby has to face. People don't understand just awful it is to be raised in a broken home. I wish more people were honest and critical when it comes to starting a family. So many people shouldn't have kids.\n\nOp only said they didn't support the couple's decision whenever her friend asked about it, I get that the friend was looking for ops support and acceptance however there is nothing there to support, I can be your friend and not support objectively bad decisions. they can still have a baby without ops support.", "And ppl saying they're working on getting a bigger house as if that's a plan?! 1) of they're this bad at money management and stretched so thin financially as is, who'd give them a mortgage, and at what interest rate? 2) ok so they somehow manage to get a bigger house, then on their already tight finances they cover the closing costs of that, provide basic baby stuff like formula and diapers, and one of them either takes off work to care for the baby or they throw childcare costs on top of the other expenses. To whom does this sound like anything resembling a sound plan?\n\nBeyond that, imo the size of the house is the least of their problems. What I'm worried about is stuff they could start working on if they were willing and able to see through their own stupidity long enough to start taking action and hold themselves accountable to it - which a tell it like it is friend could really help with if they were willing to listen. Stuff like maybe they should learn to cook even a few basic, inexpensive meals. Create routines that make cleaning feel less burdensome. Get their finances in order. Clear out some clutter to make room for the baby. Baby proof things.\n\nPeople are acting like the couple's only options are adoption/abortion or plowing forward with their head in the clouds ignoring every warning sign about how unprepared they are to be parents.

Should we submit our pay stubs to you? Or is it actually 0 of your business what reproductive choices other couples make?", "OP didn't tell them this to make them feel bad or get an abortion. Someone obviously needed to tell them to change their spending and cleaning habits. If OP (or anyone else) hadn't, they probably wouldn't change until it's too late.

I literally don't know anyone in my life who feel like they have outstanding parents because a lot of parents just kind half assed it and expect a doll.", "^ This \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc", "I didn't clearly state what I mean when I mentioned they were moving. I didn't berate them for it, I said it was good for them and my friend is excited about it. I was only worried about her pushing herself too far when it came down to moving. \n\nI also wasn't clear about their working situation. I know a lot of people work full-time while raising families. I more so used it as a (poor) example of contributing to them being tired all the time.", "My friend is one of my best friends. We've known each other for a long time. Being a good friend is more important than me be right. I didn't feel like I was behaving in a \"you're wrong\" kind of way but I was.", "I want our friendship to continue, yes. I wanted to help them see the reality of their situation but I understand now it was not my place to do so. I don't want to be an even worse friend than I already have been. I am going to try my best to rectify the situation and show my friend I do want to support her and her family, and offer my help if they want it.", "I was given the opportunity to properly apologize and I don't want to waste it. I want to continue to help them with errands and things, as well as help my friend learn how to organize and meal plan. These are things I talked about helping her with before and she seemed happy about it. I want to avoid overstepping more boundaries though. I will help them if they want it, otherwise I will respect their space and try to support them from the sidelines.", "That is something I want to make sure I include in my apology. That I believe they will be good parents and that I want to help them if they'll allow it.", "That's fine that's you didn't read the post. I did make an update where I acknowledge that I made a mistake.", "Eh idk about being born into worse situations and thriving lol, and just because that is the case doesn\u2019t mean it should be.\n\nOff topic but OP\u2019s comments may have been unwarranted but still just because these parents could raise a kid in their current environment doesn\u2019t mean they should. Not trying to be obtuse but being a good friend doesn\u2019t always mean just skirting over the hard truth.", "Wanting to not be around bad parents that hurt their children with their bad decisions is a valid reason to ghost. Gross that you endorse this.", "It's kind of insane. This subreddit loves to talk about how miserable their childhoods are, how much adversity they have to deal with, how people should be empathetic to those from less fortunate backgrounds. But they are completely oblivious to people like OP's friends who are almost certainly the reason why kids have to grow up in terrible environments.\n\nPeople who can't pay rent on time and can't keep their house clean shouldn't be having children. Babies don't just magically make people more responsible. It's just adding one more stressor in life to people who already complain about being too stressed out and tired to maintain a household.", "Possibly because most of the people who responded YTA are baby fevered women themselves with insufficient financial means to have a bab.\nIt also explains the rude tone and unreasonable arguments in the YTA replies", "People who are saying YTA and defending it by saying that OP's concerns aren't valid have never really seen kids growing up in poverty or fighting through a miserable childhood. Working with kids or in the healthcare system will make anyone wish people just had less children, particularly those who don't care enough to raise their kids well.", "Adoption exists, a kid with a family who is ready for kids will live a much better life than a kid with this train wreck of parents", "According to one of OP's comments, she did try to teach the friend, but the friend declined.", "Choosing to have a kid isn't \"when shit gets tough\". That's just a decision made and it sounds like with very poor foresight if OP is to be trusted at all.", "What's done is done? The couple doesn't have to keep the baby. And before you even say it, putting it up for adoption is an option", "People having kids when they don't have the financial means to really support them is one of the biggest contributors to the cycle of poverty. No one is ever going to say that the poor can't have children but kids growing up poor or in less than ideal environments has consequences. I've seen plenty of kids who grow up neglected or in an unhealthy environment that are given a terrible hand to start out life.

I hope that you're literally and figuratively thousands of miles away from your ex now.", "It's funny because I'm not the most responsible person with money or cleaning or time, but that's exactly the reason I've decided to not have a baby. I really think this kid is being set up for major neglect. I feel bad for the kid, not a fair start to life.", "My mistake then, good for OP. Sorry should have read that more carefully.", "That is a really good point and poorly phrased on my part. At the same time, having a newborn is tough even if it is a decision that people make - that is what I meant.", "Not obligation or anything but if your friendship with someone is serious enough to tell them that they aren't ready to have the baby they're carrying then you can also spend an afternoon teaching them to make some stew or puree some veggies. Yeah, they should have learned, but they didn't -- that's where a real friend would help out. Isn't that easier than telling your pregnant friend that she'll be a shitty mom? I feel like if someone is willing to give someone tough love and hard truths but is also unwilling to actually help that same person   actually make changes then they are kind of an AH friend. \n\nI'm not saying they should help raise the baby or anything - but helping someone figure out how to cook food or organize their house for cleaning better is not that time consuming or difficult", "I will do both of those things.", "Plus, when is a better time to move?

I learned I was pregnant in June (2006), moved in July to a new state and temporary housing, moved again in October.  Baby born in Feb.  That nesting phase that kicks in and it's amazing how much baby prep happens then.", "There are a plethora of things the pregnant friend needs to learn and do better with, not just food. Cleaning, money management, time management, maturity and foresight, saving, etc. Should OP take on those responsibilities to teach them those kills as well?\n\nThis is going to be a shitshow and it was beneficial for friend to be given a hard reality check before baby is born.
