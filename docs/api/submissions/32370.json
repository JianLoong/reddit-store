She always seemed to like me, but I always thought things were a little weird with them considering the age gap because at one point before they began dating she was my babysitter and my mom's (F47) best friend. When I was little, my step mom (whom we will call \"K\") was diagnosed bipolar. She would frequently lash out from not taking her medicine and would tell me that \"her life would be better without me\", would call my mom and tell her to \"get me out of \u2018her\u2019 house\", and when I was very young she kicked me out of the house and told me to go back to my mom's, though it was states away at the time. A few weeks ago in another episode, it was revealed she had been cheating on my dad and she announced to our family that she wanted a divorce. I won't lie, I may have been a bit of an a-hole by laughing about it to myself when I first got the news. She then said since she was leaving she did not have any kind of authority over me and told my dad to \"figure it out\". So, we did. Me and dad started to talk about how we would handle finances, my two sisters (2 and 7 y/o) with their schedules, among other things, all while K locked herself in her closet and called her new boyfriend. She has been extremely distant from the family despite still living in the house and won't pay attention to her kids. Most of the time, the kids come to me because my dad is at work. When discussing the kids in the divorce, K doesn't even want to keep them overnight! She wants to have them a few hours a day, then bring them back here for us to feed, put to bed, and get to school. She's moving far, either, her new place is 3 streets down. While otp with her new boyfriend she said \"no one in the house respects her as a mother, especially some\" and shot me a dirty look. I ignored it, but then as time passed she started to boss me around more and more telling me to \"stop being lazy and do more around the house\" because I was laying down and eventually I snapped. I told her that if she feels like no one respects her as a mother, it's because she doesn't act like one. I also told her that she does not get to pick and choose when she gets to play \"mom\" and that if she was going to choose not to, she should just leave. K got very offended and started crying saying that I'm \"the worst daughter ever\" and she hopes that my two sisters don't grow up to be like me. I then came back with \"thank god you're not my mom, cause I'm not your daughter!\". She called her boyfriend again and started yelling for him to come pick her up because she needed to leave. She kept telling me that she was leaving and I yelled \"fine, leave, it's good riddance.\" to her. I got very angry messages from her, her boyfriend, and various other family members saying that I'm the a-hole. I stand by what I said, but...

Give it to her. She deserves it.\n\nHaving mental illness is no excuse to be abusive towards people *especially* children. Not only that she didn't take her medicine, which was irresponsible. I'm sorry you had to go through that. Good riddance, indeed, that she's now out of the picture. \n\nIf her flying monkeys keep bothering you, block them. With her out of the picture they're not family anymore and with how delusional they're about her, they deserve the blocking.", "NTA. She sounds attention seeking. Repeating yourself over and over while loudly packing to leave? She expected you to apologise, grovel, and then she would be magnanimous and stay. \n\nShe sees her position in your life as way more important than it is, and she's probably most angry that you aren't \"fighting\" for her (like some demented teen romance drama). To then realise that her departure makes things better for those she's \"leaving behind\"? That must *burn her*.", "everything i wrote was all the details, the family members consist of cousins, aunts and uncles, and her siblings all on her side. i count them as family because they've been in my life for 11 years. my dad believes i had the right because of all the things i've been through", "Yep, NTA then.", "Completely NTA then, her side is delusional if they think she is any semblance of a mother", "NTA\n\nIt's her family not yours anyway so who cares and when she is out for good you will all be so much happier...", "NTA the only thing I will caution is that you don\u2019t throw your life (or 10 years) away parenting your sisters. I don\u2019t know your age but go to college, have a career & family of your own.", "I'm trying to decide, OP.  Would it have been better to yell at her as you did, or to look at her coolly and say something like \"You are no longer my problem\"?\n\nBecause you do make her sound like someone that it'd be fun to tell off.", "NTA but the way to manage someone like this is to stay calm and disengage/ask them to leave when they get abusive/shout etc. \n\nStand by and stick to your own values rather than getting destabilised into tit for tat.\n\nTry and hold the balance between boundaried and empathy. \n\nThe more you argue with her, the more she gets your energy.", "NTA and she's got some nerves.

I dont mean stay calm for moral reasons, I just mean it'll be better for your peace of mind the less you involve yourself in her drama", "I wouldn't go that far.  If OP sees them as family, they are the OP's family.
