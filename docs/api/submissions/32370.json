{"id": 32370, "submission_id": "18b2sof", "title": "AITA for telling my former step-mom she's not my mom and to leave?", "selftext": "My dad (M47) and my now-former step-mom (F34) have been together for about 12 years. She always seemed to like me, but I always thought things were a little weird with them considering the age gap because at one point before they began dating she was my babysitter and my mom's (F47) best friend. When I was little, my step mom (whom we will call \"K\") was diagnosed bipolar. She would frequently lash out from not taking her medicine and would tell me that \"her life would be better without me\", would call my mom and tell her to \"get me out of \u2018her\u2019 house\", and when I was very young she kicked me out of the house and told me to go back to my mom's, though it was states away at the time. A few weeks ago in another episode, it was revealed she had been cheating on my dad and she announced to our family that she wanted a divorce. I won't lie, I may have been a bit of an a-hole by laughing about it to myself when I first got the news. She then said since she was leaving she did not have any kind of authority over me and told my dad to \"figure it out\". So, we did. Me and dad started to talk about how we would handle finances, my two sisters (2 and 7 y/o) with their schedules, among other things, all while K locked herself in her closet and called her new boyfriend. She has been extremely distant from the family despite still living in the house and won't pay attention to her kids. Most of the time, the kids come to me because my dad is at work. When discussing the kids in the divorce, K doesn't even want to keep them overnight! She wants to have them a few hours a day, then bring them back here for us to feed, put to bed, and get to school. She's moving far, either, her new place is 3 streets down. While otp with her new boyfriend she said \"no one in the house respects her as a mother, especially some\" and shot me a dirty look. I ignored it, but then as time passed she started to boss me around more and more telling me to \"stop being lazy and do more around the house\" because I was laying down and eventually I snapped. I told her that if she feels like no one respects her as a mother, it's because she doesn't act like one. I also told her that she does not get to pick and choose when she gets to play \"mom\" and that if she was going to choose not to, she should just leave. K got very offended and started crying saying that I'm \"the worst daughter ever\" and she hopes that my two sisters don't grow up to be like me. I then came back with \"thank god you're not my mom, cause I'm not your daughter!\". She called her boyfriend again and started yelling for him to come pick her up because she needed to leave. She kept telling me that she was leaving and I yelled \"fine, leave, it's good riddance.\" to her. I got very angry messages from her, her boyfriend, and various other family members saying that I'm the a-hole. I stand by what I said, but...

And I think you know that and needed to vent, which is ok, because your family is in a crappy situation with a woman who not only appears to be very unwell but is - by your telling - kind of a bad person.

Have your dad start divorce proceedings immediately and go for full custody. Save all the text and be extra sneaky and things like text her so what kind of schedule do you want with your children. And that way your father can get child support from her. There's no reason she should still be living at the house.
