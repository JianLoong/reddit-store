You need to do what you think is best.

Even texted him before I went under that I was starting surgery and I\u2019d see him soon. He was there before my surgery was done. And tried soooo hard to get a loopy statement out of me. Unfortunately for him, I react super well to anesthesia and am wide awake when I do wake up. \n\nSide note: it is super fun when someone is waking up from anesthesia to see how they react. You have a wide range of loopy, sleepy, and actually coherent reactions. It\u2019s less fun with people like my son and I who are completely coherent and alert.

And that was just for a hysterectomy. I am highly suspect that for a major surgery for cancer, the hospital will let you just drop him off and bounce.\n\nIf you absolutely don't want to wait, then you guys need to make arrangements for someone else to be there (keeping in mind that this person needs to be the one to make any decisions that may arise during the course of the surgery).\n\nPersonally, I'd wait.

This hospitals policy at the time was that someone who could speak for my mom legally had to be there during the surgery.  \n\nAt the hospital in my town you can give permission verbally but, from what I understood, there has to be someone with you when you call to witness the call plus basically verify that you are who you say you are.  I don\u2019t know my hometown hospital is really bad and has strange policies, in my opinion. \n\nYour husband is fine with you not being there, his opinion is what matters.  Check the hospital policy as to what happens if something goes wrong (chances are slim that it will occur).  Make sure you can be contacted at any time.  No one should criticize you or your husband for how you both deal with the surgery.   \n\nWishing your husband all the best and a speedy recovery."]}
