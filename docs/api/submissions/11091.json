My best friend Alana(20f) is in the same uni as me.\n\nAlana is one of the most important people in my life. We have been bestfriends for 5 years, she's an amazing friend. She's smart, funny, athletic, and just a great person overall.\n\nI have a friend, Sean(19m) whom I met online. We instantly connected and became close. Later I came to know that he was in our uni, he was my junior. When we met in person, I introduced him to all of my friends including Alana.\n\nSean fell in love with her only after meeting a few times. After he conveyed his feelings, she rejected him as she's a very traditional person and has decided to directly go for arranged marriage.\n\nWell, Sean is a very handsome guy and generally has girls following him around, has tons of dating experience and never had to approach a woman first. Alana on the other hand, is not the prettiest and barely attracts any boys. (Please note that I'm not degrading her, it's just for description purposes)\n\nHe didn't take the rejection very well. He then made it very obvious to everyone that he liked her. She became the centre of his personality, everything about him revolved around her. Despite this she always acted very casually with him and he too, didn't do anything to make her uncomfortable.\n\nToday me, Alana and one of our close friend, Hailey went to get pizza after college. It was initially going to be girls time and we had plenty of things to discuss. Knowing that we were out Sean invited himself with us. We didn't mind his presence and went along with our talks.\n\nI talked about my elder sister and how she was being pampered by her fiance and in-laws and the conversation shifted to Alana as she revealed how she had received some marriage proposals. She was pretty excited and so were we, for her possible engagement. The 3 of us begin to plan out everything we would for her engagement party.\n\nAll the time Sean just quietly ate his pizza with a grim expression. Though, I did notice it, I decided not to bring it up in front of everyone. As soon as he was done eating, he insisted that we leave and since I was the one dropping him home, we all left together.\n\nAfter reaching his home, he told me how he was disappointed in me for bringing up such nonsense thing to talk about. I asked him what he meant and he said he knew I was trying to make him jealous by talking about Alana's engagement. I explained that he misread the situation and that we were just having our girls talk. This upset him even more and he asked not to talk about these things with Alana. I laughed and said that it must be a joke and I can discuss whatever I want with my best friend.\n\nWe argued a little And I told him that his jealousy was not my problem and that he should learn to have a better control over his emotions. He looked upset but didn't say a word and left. Now he is giving me the silent treatment.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit Sean has never displayed any bad behaviour and get's long with my friends pretty well. I am NOT the mediator between him and Alana.", "created_utc": 1677528613, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11dlgs9/aita_for_telling_my_friend_his_jealousy_is_not_my/", "score": 330, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She may be putting up with him for your sake, so you need to explicitly give her permission to cut him out of her life.", "Besides that theres always the chance the relationship she chooses falls apart. \n\nI did later date a couple of people i crushed on in high school when they became available later on, however in this case the person has actually turned him down directly after assessing his suitability. \n\nAlso arranged marriage was glossed over as if its not a huge detail. \n\nClearly they are already from a very misogynistic culture.", "Not at all, they both belong to different communities. And as I mentioned, Alana is very traditional, so is her family.", "Sean is an AH big time, but I am going to have to disagree a tiny bit on one point here. I think there is a slight possibility that OP is an minor AH too, in this scenario.\n\nHe made Alana the center of his personality after she rejected him and made sure to let everyone know it\u2026but Alana was totally fine being around him after that and he never revealed this to her with disturbing behavior EVER? This just does not add up to me. It seems like a very one-sided point of view. I have my suspicions that Alana could have felt extremely uncomfortable around him. I would immediately assume that letting Sean be around Alana was not a good idea just from what was described. \n\nIs it possible she brought up these marriage proposals in front of him on purpose to try and make him back off? It seems likely.\n\nThis is where I think OP may be a little bit of an asshole. If I had a friend that was acting so inappropriately about one of my other friends I certainly wouldn\u2019t be bringing him around her. \n\nOP says Sean has never displayed bad behavior but making a girl who rejected you the center of your personality and making sure everyone knows how into her you are\u2026that IS bad behavior in my book and there is not a chance in hell that Alana doesn\u2019t know and feel at least a little uncomfortable about it. Besides, he has never displayed bad behavior around YOU (before this incident) that doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t happen.\n\nBut good on OP for standing up to him, he was acting completely inappropriately.", "NTA.  He invited himself which is rude behavior.  Then he isn\u2019t happy when you talk about things you would have talked about normally.

Does she know this guy is obsessing over her, and possibly stalking her??\n\nA guy who is used to female attention, but acts like this when a woman doesn\u2019t give it to him, is a MASSIVE red flag not only for your friend, but for your \u201cfriendship\u201d with him. Like, do you know what he may actually think about you? Or, what would happen if he finds himself attracted to you (or, anyone else you know)?  \nBehavior like this is what preludes women getting really hurt or killed.

But I would still encourage you to have an honest conversation with her.  She deserves to know that he's harboring unrealistic feelings for her - guys that hang on like Sean is doing often cross a line, so it's important that she's aware of the current situation so she can make an informed decision.  And you need to tell her that it's okay with you if the friend group carries on as-is or if she would prefer to distance herself from Sean.  As the person who introduced the two of them you hold a unique position and Alana may feel a sense of obligation to keep up contact with Sean even though she'd prefer not to.\n\nDon't assume you can read her mind.  Talk to her.\n\nYou need to understand that those of us with more experience have seen many guys who behave like Sean is now turn into truly dangerous stalkers.  I really hope Sean won't do that, but he's already well past the line of what's appropriate.  To you he's just your good friend.  And it's fine if you're able to maintain that positive relationship with him.  But you need to give Alana the option to pull back.  And honestly, it would be healthier for Sean to have some distance from her so he can get his feelings under control and hopefully move on to someone who reciprocates his feelings.", "Sorry, but, you both are being overly permissive (and, dare I say, delusional) about this dangerously unhealthy behavior, and ignoring the real risks that come with people who act like this.\n\nNobody worth the attention of more than an ant would act like this \u201cin the heat of the moment\u201d.. what moment?? This guy has had enough moments to build up an image and obsess over your friend to a point where her name can\u2019t be mentioned without him putting HIS emotions first. He\u2019s made you and others notice it and feel uncomfortable about it.\n\nI\u2018m betting Alana is a lot more nervous and uncomfortable about this than she\u2019s letting on.", "Oh noooo. Your friend needs to read The Gift of Fear like yesterday.", "NTA\n\n\u201c\u2026the Gemara notes that Rav Yehuda says that Rav says: There was an incident involving a certain man who set his eyes upon a certain woman and passion rose in his heart, to the point that he became deathly ill. And they came and asked doctors what was to be done with him. And the doctors said: He will have no cure until she engages in sexual intercourse with him. The Sages said: Let him die, and she may not engage in sexual intercourse with him. The doctors said: She should at least stand naked before him. The Sages said: Let him die, and she may not stand naked before him. The doctors suggested: The woman should at least converse with him behind a fence in a secluded area, so that he should derive a small amount of pleasure from the encounter.
