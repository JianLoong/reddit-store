{"id": 11091, "submission_id": "11dlgs9", "title": "AITA for telling my friend his jealousy is not my problem?", "selftext": "I(19f) am senior in college. My best friend Alana(20f) is in the same uni as me.\n\nAlana is one of the most important people in my life. We have been bestfriends for 5 years, she's an amazing friend. She's smart, funny, athletic, and just a great person overall.\n\nI have a friend, Sean(19f) whom I met online. We instantly connected and became close. Later I came to know that he was in our uni, he was my junior. When we met in person, I introduced him to all of my friends including Alana.\n\nSean fell in love with her only after meeting a few times. After he conveyed his feelings, she rejected him as she's a very traditional person and has decided to directly go for arranged marriage.\n\nWell, Sean is a very handsome guy and generally has girls following him around, has tons of dating experience and never had to approach a woman first. Alana on the other hand, is not the prettiest and barely attracts any boys. (Please note that I'm not degrading her, it's just for description purposes)\n\nHe didn't take the rejection very well. He then made it very obvious to everyone that he liked her. She became the centre of his personality, everything about him revolved around her. Despite this she always acted very casually with him and he too, didn't do anything to make her uncomfortable.\n\nToday me, Alana and one of our close friend, Hailey went to get pizza after college. It was initially going to be girls time and we had plenty of things to discuss. Knowing that we were out Sean invited himself with us. We didn't mind his presence and went along with our talks.\n\nI talked about my elder sister and how she was being pampered by her fiance and in-laws and the conversation shifted to Alana as she revealed how she had received some marriage proposals. She was pretty excited and so were we, for her possible engagement. The 3 of us begin to plan out everything we would for her engagement party.\n\nAll the time Sean just quietly ate his pizza with a grim expression. Though, I did notice it, I decided not to bring it up in front of everyone. As soon as he was done eating, he insisted that we leave and since I was the one dropping him home, we all left together.\n\nAfter reaching his home, he told me how he was disappointed in me for bringing up such nonsense thing to talk about. I asked him what he meant and he said he knew I was trying to make him jealous by talking about Alana's engagement. I explained that he misread the situation and that we were just having our girls talk. This upset him even more and he asked not to talk about these things with Alana. I laughed and said that it must be a joke and I can discuss whatever I want with my best friend.\n\nWe argued a little And I told him that his jealousy was not my problem and that he should learn to have a better control over his emotions. He looked upset but didn't say a word and left. Now he is giving me the silent treatment.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1677528613, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11dlgs9/aita_for_telling_my_friend_his_jealousy_is_not_my/", "score": 217, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He is the epitome of guys who think they've been friendzoned, when in reality, the girl just isn't interested in him.

It's been made clear to him that Alana isn't interested in him. He invited himself along to hang around her and it's on him that he didn't like the way the conversation was going when he wasn't explicitly invited. Alana's going to get married to someone other than him. He needs to accept that and move on.", "NTA.\n\nPlease make sure your friend\u2019s engagement goes smoothly because Sean\u2019s obsession with someone who rejected him who is now engaged is a dangerous mixture.", "NTA\n\nStop wasting your time with Sean\n\nhe is obsessed with one of your friends, that obsession has become toxic, and he won't take no for an answer", "NTA. Let him have his little mantrum. You are correct. He needs to have better control over how he behaves. You did nothing wrong.", "Red flags seriously. Stop hanging out with him. Nta", "NTA\n\nHe's throwing a mantrum for not getting his way.", "NTA- Sean kinda sounds like a creep.  Even weirder that he can get lots of girls but is obsessed with this one who has no interest and as you said is objectively not super attractive.  \n\nSomething just seems off.  I can\u2019t explain it but he barley knows her and is seemingly obsessed.  I know men in serious relationships who didn\u2019t take this long to get over actual heartbreak", "NTA. at all. she kindly rejected him and she has all right to talk about what she wants, especially if it\u2019s her life. for him getting mad at you about YOU bringing up the topic (when you didn\u2019t) that\u2019s 100% all him and none of it you. you are 100% NTA.", "NTA, Sean's feelings are Sean's feelings not yours. He has a right to feel however he feels, but he doesn't have a right to his actions. Telling you what you can and can't talk about is controlling and not acceptable behavior. Inviting yourself along is also rude. Let's face it he did it just so he could be close to Alana, thinking that maybe one day she'll see him in other eyes, like a rom com. This will obviously never happen. Sean needs to get a grip and move on, he's likely only obsessed because Alana is the only woman to ever reject him.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe invited himself to your girls day. Ditch him completely, this has way too many red flags.", "If you spend anytime at all in this subreddit you should be able to recognize pretty quickly that Sean is Doing Bad Man Things and he needs to stop immediately.\n\nAnd you don't want to be trading your friend of 5 years for some stray you found on the Internet.\n\nMove on.\n\nNTA", "NTA, OP.  let Sean the entitled misogynist work out his own plethora of problems.  his next relationship will likely be worthy of a slot on Jerry Springer or Dr. Phil, and both you and Alana can be glad you're not a chapter in that book of misery.", "NTA. dude got so used to getting it. He never learned how to handle someone telling him no. That can be problematic and he needs to go figure that out before he tries dating again. Congrats to your friend!", "NTA you were right.
