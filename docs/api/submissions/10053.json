To the people saying that OP shouldn't have made the driver wait -- OP didn't know, and clearly states as much. OP thought that the driver was just an entitled person who didn't want to wait in line. If OP knew, yeah, you could make a case for saying they're TA, but since they didn't it's not an asshole move of them to not let someone cut in front of them without a sharing a reason.", "NTA they still need to follow the \u201crules\u201d.

She doesn't get to cut in front of you.", "NTA, I\u2019ve driven for DoorDash before and it sucks to wait, but that\u2019s the job. And honestly most places have a separate drop off for the deliveries/doordashes, so I\u2019m curious why they even needed to talk to the cashier.", "NTA but this is odd to me. I've worked at restaurants before, and Dashers usually kinda stand off to the side instead of getting in line, and the cashier will take a second in between customers to ask which order they're there for.", "NTA - Being a delivery driver doesn't make them special, they get to wait like everyone else. Lots of places have dedicated delivery driver areas now, but if they don't then get in line.", "NTA. I hate entitled ass people. It doesn\u2019t matter if they were Wendy themselves you don\u2019t just cut in front of people.", "Working people don't skip the line.  Not at the lumber yard and not in traffic.

That being said, the restaurant is dumb af if they don\u2019t have a dedicated space for delivery people. You are in no way the AH for ordering first, as you were there before the driver even arrived, but it\u2019s very stupid of them to not have even just a sign on the pick up area of the the counter directing delivery drivers to ask from there. It just bogs things up for the drivers, the workers, and people like you trying to get your food.", "NTA- you didn't know why she cut the line.", "NTA\n\nYou had no obligation to move.", "NTA.

I'm just grabbing a bag for a delivery.  Do you mind if I just step in and grab it?\"  People can still use manners in 2023.", "Whether someone is working or not does not make my time less valuable. By going in front of someone you are basically saying that person can wait because what you are doing is important. That is ridiculous and entitled.", "So if I'm working, but I'm on my lunch break getting food, the drivers time is more valuable than mine? No business has figured this out where it's easy to resolve this but the answer is definitely not all humans must defer to delivery drivers. If you want to DoorDash deliver, cool. But it's not my job to help your order go faster so you can make more money. I'm just there to eat man. My time is valuable too.", "I\u2019m from NYC.  I have an empanada place I love.  I place my order for pickup ahead of time and pay online.

I could argue that I might be on my lunch break and have limited time, but honestly it doesn't matter if I want to go watch grass grow.

I haven\u2019t dashed in a while but plan to again soon.  From what I remember (at least in my area), Wendy\u2019s was a restaurant where we actually had to place the order ourselves and pay with a special debit card.  IF this was the case and that dasher had to place the order in person, then I would consider them a customer just like anyone else and they should wait their turn.  IF things have changed and they can just say the name they\u2019re picking up for, I would still say they were 100% wrong for just stepping in front of you, but it would at least be a shorter wait for you.  I would usually just go to the side of the counter where orders are picked up and would make sure my delivery bag was visible and the staff would know the drill.", "NTA.

Great perspectives. The good news, the $5 biggie bag was delicious", "YTA it\u2019s an order that\u2019s already been completed.

If the place doesn't then they wait in line like any other customer.", "NTA - Since when do delivery drivers get to cut the line?  I get that they\u2019re in a hurry to deliver the order, but most people in line are probably in a hurry too.  Sometimes there is a separate area where they can pick up their orders, but it doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s the case at this store. The DoorDash driver is the AH for assuming they can just cut the line.", "YTA, her order was already in.", "Until last August I worked at a course fast food. We of course did Door Dash. There\u2019s a fairly long counter where there\u2019s nothing there where people pick up their orders. All of Door Dash in our town goes straight to that part of the counter. They say who they are then go wait. They technically cut in front but they weren\u2019t ordering. Your NTA because you didn\u2019t know. If they were ordering for themselves as well they would stand in line like everyone else without cutting in.

No one on here would ever attempt to stop a door dash driver from going to the front of the line to get an order that\u2019s waiting and if you did you\u2019d be ignored by the restaurant staff.  Downvote all you want", "NTA I dashed last year and always waited if they didn't have a designated line/area. I've been on both sides of that line. In store customers get priority in the line you are in if there is not an area for delivery.", "NTA.   \nA lot of delivery drivers take liberties because \"they're working\".  \nUnless that order was already bought and paid for, too bad.", "NTA   \nWhat is she doing cutting in front of you in line?

So you get a huge NTA from me. Some of the worst work ethic I\u2019ve ever seen comes from dashers.
