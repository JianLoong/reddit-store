Approaching strangers is not safe and above your authority.", "What do you mean especially \"that\"breed? If you are allergic then you are allergic. While there are some dogs that are supposed to shed less therefore not cause much of a reaction, there is no one breed that someone can be that allergic too.", "ESH. He should follow the rules, but you\u2019re allergic to that breed, so you approached him with the dog? You just could\u2019ve got what you needed, avoided the dog,  and told a worker your concerns.", "ESH. The man, obviously.  But, you should have alerted staff.  It can be dangerous to confront people. That makes it worse for others around.  If you are allergic, and you go near to the person to talk t9 them, you will make other people criticize you for that.  It\u2019s just a bad idea, all around.  Next time, get the manager.", "INFO\n\nSo how do you know this person and if you're so allergic, why are you getting close to the dog?", "ESH\n\nYeah he shouldn\u2019t be bringing his dog to a place that restricts nonservice animals. He especially should make sure that his dog is at home in an air conditioned space since it\u2019s so hot.\n\nHowever, you went out of your way to approach a dog that you\u2019re supposedly allergic to, for what reason? Voice your concerns to the customer service desk and leave. As a customer it\u2019s not for you to tell someone to leave a place they\u2019re patronizing.", "ESH. People who bring non-working dogs into stores give service animals a bad name. They assume their dog will be well-behaved and when something happens (dog pees, freaks out at a service dog, is spooked by unexpected noises, etc) they're surprised. Only service animals should be allowed, and people blatantly ignore that. Ive seen a dog fight, and a dog lunge at someone while in places where they were not allowed and the rule was not followed. \n\nThat being said, you made a nuisance and AH of yourself by yelling at the person unnecessarily and escalating the situation. You didn't solve the situation at all and likely made it worse. You should have alerted a staff member of the situation, as it is their job.", "ESH\n\nHe's an AH for dragging his dog along while he runs his errands--regardless of whether he is intending on bringing the dog inside or leaving it in the car. He should be leaving his dog at home, unless he's going somewhere like PetSmart where his pet is welcome (clearly not the case here).\n\nBut you're kind of one, too. As a fellow customer of the store, you don't get to decide how stringent a store is on their own policies. If they decide to allow the dog inside due to weather conditions, that's entirely their decision. You can be upset with them for doing so, you're even justified in berating them considering the health factor you mentioned. The thing is, nowhere in your retelling of events do you mention approaching a staff member or management. If they were unaware of the dog in their store, you never gave them a chance to handle it *their* way. Instead, you approached a relative stranger and yelled at them about breaking *someone else's* rules...", "[deleted]", "Yes, YTA, because it\u2019s the store\u2019s job to enforce their rules, not you.
