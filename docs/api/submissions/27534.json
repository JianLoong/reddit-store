Sam always knew I did not want to have children of my own. He was fine with it. \n\nHe has a daughter Leah (F25). His wife died when  Leah was 10 years old and I met him when she was 15. I didn't meet her till after a  year of dating. She was a sweet young adult and we got along great. I did not move in with Sam till Leah left for college though. \n\nLeah got pregnant last year. Her boyfriend did not want to keep the baby but she wanted to keep it. He broke up with her. Leah moved back in with us cause she could not afford her lifestyle without him. She worked as a teacher and he was the bread winner. \n\nI had concerns about how she was going to raise a child on a teacher's salary by herself. I suggested getting him to pay child support. She did not want that. Sam thought I should stay out of it. Fine. \n\nBut once she had the baby around 4 months back, Leah seemed to realise having a baby is not the sunshine and rainbows she thought it was. She barely got any sleep during the last four months. All the while Sam was helping her with the baby while I did almost all chores myself. \n\nNow her leave is ending. She did not want to leave baby at daycare or with a nanny. Sam and I both work as well. \n\nShe asked if I could stay home with the baby. I said no. First, it is not my baby, and I never wanted to raise a child. Second, I have work. \n\nShe asked Sam who asked me to do it instead. I refused stating the reasons again. Sam couldn't stay home because he earned more than me and covered more bills. \n\nI asked why Leah can't stay home with the baby herself. She said how she was young and had to build a career. I said many people take breaks to raise kids, and she broke down crying about how she was so tired all the time being a mom and she needed something else in her life too. \n\nSam feels bad for her and thinks we should help her. I suggested she pay for nanny with her income but Leah doesn't want strangers looking after her baby. \n\nBoth of them are pressuring me to stay home with baby so she can go to work. I am standing firm on my decision. \n\nLeah said yesterday how she wished her mom was alive since she would have had her back. She said I didnt love her and my husband is also mad at me. \n\nAITA for refusing to help my stepdaughter with her baby?\n\nMaybe necessary info? Leah's mom was a SAHM.", "created_utc": 1695573381, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16r25ml/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_step_daughter_with/", "score": 7156, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is *Leah's* baby, that *she alone* chose to have. That doesn't obligate you to change YOUR life to suit *her* desires.  The whole business of saying you don't love her because you won't quit your job to watch her baby is so manipulative and messed up and i'm shocked your husband is siding with her. \n\nIf I were you i'd sit down privately with husband and remind him that Leah is the one that chose to have this baby and she is solely responsible for it; that you never signed up to be a full time babysitter and it's unreasonable to expect you to quit your job and that you're disappointed and hurt that he is not understanding of that.", "NTA. Especially in the face of all this pressure and manipulation to give up your work/career at only 38 years of age and raise a baby while you had been clear you never wanted babies. This isn't \"helping stepdaughter with baby.\" This is a full-on giving up your life for something you've never wanted to do so that your stepdaughter could have a life instead of raising her own baby she insisted on having. No. I mean -- if this continues, I'd consult a divorce lawyer.", "NTA. She didn't ask you to help she asked you to pretty much give up your career and raise your step grand child! Help would have been if she said, \"Can you see about maybe watching the baby when my school has evening staff meetings?\" or \"Can you and dad maybe work out your schedules so the baby spends as little time in day care like doing a late start for work and dropping her off on the way to work and I can pick her up after school?\" \n\nMany day care centers give discounts to teachers because they know how hard they work and little they get paid. Also, once she knew she was going to keep the baby, that was when she should have started asking her coworkers and friends for child care recommendations. (I wouldn't say that to her now as I am sure she knows it). \n\nExplain to her that you are not refusing to help with your granddaughter but that you need to focus on your career as well and that you will help her come up with a plan. She needs to find reliable child care for when she is teaching during the day and I am sure someone at the school can help her. She needs to get child support from her ex to help pay for the costs (it's his child too, and he can pay child support without having visitation rights).  You and your husband should then sit down with her and figure out a good childcare option for when she is working and what emergency plans will be if say she has to stay late for a staff meeting or travel overnight for a conference. \n\nI can 100% guarantee you her late mother would agree with this.  Also don't take to heart what she is saying: post partum depression can be very difficult to cope with and I promise she still likes you and is just dealing with a lot right now.", "NTA\n\nYour husband and Leah are acting like this baby was somehow part of your responsibilities. He's not, not even a little bit.\n\nIf Leah needs childcare, she has to trust a nanny or sacrifice her career for the baby. She can't guilt-trip you into playing her role as a mother and give up your job for someone else's child.\n\nLet her fend for herself and assume her responsibilities. Your husband should teach her to act like an adult instead of confusing you with the baby's dad or something, you don't have to be a SAHM for someone else's baby while the real mother builds her career. That's the sacrifice parents make, not you.\n\nShe could have asked the father to be a SAHD, but he's no longer in the picture. Expecting this of her stepmother is way out of line.", "What the fuuuuck is this nonsense?! The audacity to assume that YOU out of the three of you would be the one to stay home. Put the damn kid in daycare. She needs to get over that. \n\nThis is why I don\u2019t date men with kids\u2014even older kids. There\u2019s always the possibility of them moving back home. Kids = drama\n\nNTA", "NTA Leah can either send the kid to daycare or get the father's family involved. It's not your job or responisbility to raise her mistakes", "NTA. Even if you were baby's biological grandmother, why would you quit your job to take care of the baby. If she doesn't want the baby to stay with strangers, she can either stay home and go back to building career once she is comfortable with enrolling her child in daycare or your husband can stay home since he agrees with her ideas.", "NTA! What, when you suggest getting child support from the father, you're told to butt out, but now you're supposed to stay home and care for the baby you never wanted? Absolutely not. Stand firm. You have very good reasons for your decision, and those two need to find some other solution.", "NTA but I would be reconsidering you relationship with a partner that seems to disrespect your boundaries and a step daughter who does the same. He should have your back in this situation. It\u2019s a horrible situation your stepdaughter is in but to ask you, who never wanted kids, to handle her responsibility. Your stepdaughter is acting extremely entitled and your husband is enabling her.", "NTA\n\n1. She doesn't want him to pay child support? WTF? It's his responsibility too. If she doesn't want to use that money now, she can put it into a college fund for the child's future. \n\n2. No having kids is not all sunshine and roses. Sam helped her while you did all the household chores? Great so you already help with the baby. \n\n3. She is tired of being a mom all the time after 4 months? Errr... while I get that she needs something beside that it's HER responsibility to figure something out. She asked you. That's ok. You said no. End of it. She asked her dad. Dad said no. End of it. Now she has to make the choice what is more important to her: no strangers around baby or her career. \n\n4. As hard as this sounds, but she can wish all she wants that her mom was still alive, that's not the reality. And she has no idea what her mom would have done in this situation. \n\n5. Besides YOU actually have her back. Just not in the way she wants. \n\n\"She said I didn't love her\" - wow manipulative much?", "Clearly NTA! why should you give up your life for someone else to live there\u2019s? You have a career too that is (assumedly) also important for you.", "Leah is incredibly immature. No child support, when she has 2 people to support on a teachers salary. Incredibly naive budgeting decision. Her child needs the money. I don\u2019t want my child raised by strangers so now it\u2019s step Moms problem. It sounds like she is never moving out and hubby has her back not yours. I wouldn\u2019t quit my job to raise my children\u2019s children just like my Mom didn\u2019t quit her job to raise mine NTA Good luck you are going to need it to keep living with them", "NTA.

Why in the world would you give up your career to do this. Not earning an income not only impacts you now, but also into retirement. She needs to use a daycare or hire a nanny. She already has her housing taken care of. This is a ridiculous request to make of you.", "NTA. You gave her lots of alternative options, refusing to consider them is her choice. She was the AH even before she drew the Dead Mom-card, but drawing it certainly didn't help her when I made my judgement.", "NTA. It's a parent's job to care for the baby - not yours. And sure enough, you could not be mandated to. On top of it, she refused to get child support and she is refusing to get a carer for the baby.\n\nEverybody knows that when you are an adult, you make the choices and are held accountable. It's perfectly fine to decide to keep the child, but then the parent needs to rearrange their life (not somebody else's) around their child - like all parents do. Surely, family, relatives, in-laws, and friends can - and often will - help but the primary responsibility is on the parent. Quite simply, she needs to realise she no longer is a child and is actually the parent now, and make the expected adjustments.", "Nta. Time for divorce because this won't get better", "NTA-  I don't have kids, but neither of my parents would have been willing to quit their jobs to stay home with a child if any of my siblings or I had asked them to.  Even now that they are retired they watch some of my niblings (some are too old to need to be babysat), but only now and then.", "NTA\n\nYour husband knew your boundaries before you got married. That he\u2019s trying to push you into this shows what you want doesn\u2019t matter. You need to remind him constantly when he tries to push you that he is not respecting your boundaries, that he was fine with when you got married, and nothing has changed in the interim.\n\nAnd stepdaughter needs to understand that having a baby is taking responsibility for another life, something she signed up for but you didn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t matter that she\u2019s over it already, it\u2019s what she decided. If she wants a life as well, then that\u2019ll happen in 18 years (if she\u2019s lucky).\n\nThis child is not your responsibility.\n\nStepdaughter can still go for child support to help pay for daycare/nanny/babysitter. Stepdaughter can still put the child up for adoption. Child is young enough that a childless couple would beg to take her, since babies are in demand by adopters.\n\nStepdaughter obviously can\u2019t cope on her own, but that\u2019s also not your responsibility, based on the fact that you never wanted kids.\n\nMake sure to never babysit. I\u2019d also suggest not even helping feed or change the baby. Any little crack in your resolve will lead your husband and his daughter to keep pushing you to what they want.\n\nIt may come down to an ultimatum with your husband. It may end your marriage, but this is your hill to die on.", "NTA but this is probably the end of your marriage.", "Definitely NTA. My answer would have been welcome to real life Leah, you have to sacrifice a lot of things once you become a parent. You didn't sign up for it, Leah did.  Is she going to pay you for staying at home? Or is it free?.", "Leah is 25, not 15. You and your husband are already helping her out by allowing her to move back into the house with her child. The baby's father should be paying child support, which could pay for child care. It is her choice to not pursue that, not yours.  Most mothers do not prefer having someone outside of family care for their child, but as a single mother she needs to work to support herself and her child. The biggest problem in this situation seems to be your husband. He should be supporting you in your decision.  NTA, but he and your stepdaughter appear to be.", "NTA. Leah needs to put her baby daddy on child support and take off the rose colored glasses. She chose to have a child by a deadbeat. Why would you stay home to raise her child? She\u2019s getting more than enough help as is.", "NTA in anyway shape or form. It\u2019s her responsibility not yours. She is immature and needs to make decisions that she may not want to.", "NTA\nI don't understand why she willingly have baby and then  try to pawn it off on someone else. SHE is the one that decided to have the baby so SHE needs to be watching her own baby. If she can't then it needs to be put up for adoption", "NTA but SD and husband are. You clearly have a husband problem and need to address it with him. This is not what you agreed upon or signed up for. This needs to be your hill to die on or else you'll end up raising this child.", "NTA. She CHOSE to have this baby, alone.    She\u2019s already living with you, presumably for free or a very reasonable rate.  She is CHOOSING not to go after the father for child support.

Even if you wanted to, it would not be smart\u2014these are still important earning years for you, why should you be set back like this? Should you get divorced you could easily be impoverished\u2014this is how it happens to older women, they don't have enough social security, enough retirement savings in their own names because they took a break mid-career.  Your stepdaughter should get the father of the child to pay support so she can hire help, so that she has a life, has a chance at a career. You were right when you suggested it in the first place, and it really is as simple as that.", "NTA. This is incredibly unfair of them to ask you.

Get the baby daddy to pay child support.  You are the only one being a reasonable adult here.  This is annoying AF.", "NTA. That\u2019s a pretty big ask. \u201coh stepmom, I know I told you to stay out of all of my decisions regarding my child, but I just realized that parenting sucks so can you give up your career and do it for me?\u201d", "Her refusing to go for child support is a betrayal of the child IMHO.  And now she wants you to take up the slack.  You need to be elsewhere for a while.  NTA", "NTA. Your stepdaughter and your husband are nuts suggesting you give up your job.  For one thing, you are only 38. It's not like you are nearing retirement after a long, successful career. It sounds like they are trying to trap you into being a full-time nanny/housewife.  If you don't have your own money,  you will be dependent upon your husband for support.   You will be giving up your independence.   Second,  you already said you want to be child-free.  Her child is not your responsibility.   Just be aware that this may end up being a deal breaker for your marriage.   Prepare for it now.  If you don't have your own savings, start an account now.", "NTA. Of the four adults involved, OP, you are the person with the LEAST obligation to look after the baby. I am sympathetic to Sam's daughter, but both she and Sam are being very unreasonable here. Her telling you that you don't love her is a manipulative tactic. Yes, giving up paid work to look after a baby is a big risk to a woman's career. It causes her to lose her power over her future and put that power in the hands of whoever is earning the household income. It makes one very vulnerable. But why should you be the one to do it? Her moral compass is off kilter and needs recalibrating. \n\nSam's position is also very problematic, as Sam would rather see you give up your financial independence to help Leah, even though he knows you would be very unhappy giving up your career and that you chose not to have a child for that very reason. There's no pressing life-or-death reason here why ANY of you should have to give up your careers, as daycare is a thing in the modern world. Sam is being very unreasonable in how he balances his loyalties to you and to Leah. Basically, he is throwing you under the bus for the sake of Leah's nonessential preferences. \n\nApart from the financial problem with you giving up work to look after the baby, it also would be unfair to you emotionally. You would not be getting the benefits that a mother gets from giving up her career to be with her baby, because you would not be free to enjoy the baby the way a mother is. You would not be able to decide the baby's schedule or deal with his needs in the way that worked for you. You'd have to obey Leah's instructions, and from what you describe of Leah's attitude to you, she wouldn't be considerate of your needs, nor would she be appreciative. I think the whole experience would be miserable, you would be the \"bad guy\" no matter how hard you tried to follow Leah's instructions. I do not think Sam would defend you if there was a conflict between you and Leah over how you nanny the baby, because Sam has already shown that he will be unreasonable towards you if it's what Leah wants. If things went sour in the relationship between you and Leah, Sam could divorce you and you would have neither his financial support, nor your career. \n\nThere are also some practical things here that are unreasonable. Why on earth does she not want to get child support from the baby's father? Also, financially, Leah is benefitting from free housing at her father's home. Why does she feel so hard done by? She wants free housing AND a free fulltime nanny? Wow, entitled. Also, refusing to put the baby in daycare or have an outside nanny is unreasonable. The vast majority of mothers in the western world put their babies in daycare. Daycare in the USA (I assume you are in the USA?) is highly regulated to ensure babies' safety. \n\nFrom every possible angle, this proposal is unfair to you.", "nta", "\"If that's something you want for your child/grandchild, then you do it.\" \n\nNTA, but they're definitely going to try to dump the baby on you more and more until you divorce your husband.", "> I suggested getting him to pay child support. She did not want that.   \n>  \n>my husband is also mad at me\n\nSo just to recap; Leah is entitled and stupid.  Sam is a liar and an ass.\n\nThe first thing I would do is go to HR at work and say my spouse and I are having some difficulties and if he calls to tries to schedule time off/schedule a leave of absence/tender my resignation ext... not to do it.  Next, Sam gets sat down told we need couples counseling.  After that, Leah needs to be convinced to get child support/WIC/any other benefits to try and take some of the pressure off.  Finally OP needs to stick to her guns about not being baby's surrogate mom/nanny.", "NTA and for ME, that would be a dealbreaker. Your husband knew from the very beginning that you are childfree by choice and NOW he's trying to babytrap you WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S BABY? Ummm NO. Hell no! Talk to my lawyer NO.", "Nta if I was you I could be heavily considering separating from your husband for a bit. It sounds like Leah is a brat who wants to do what she wants but not deal with the consequences. She wants to be a single mom she has to have  strange watch her kid.

She should file for it and have her ex be paying in manageable bits now because her child could file for back pay later and he would be hit with a shock settlement. The money isn\u2019t about her. It\u2019s for their child. He had sex, he knew there was a risk of a baby. Even if he doesn\u2019t want to be involved in parenting, he is financially responsible for the child.\n\nYes, Leah needs something that is just for her. She needs to be more than just a mom.

She needs to do as you said, pursue child support, then look at childcare options.  It is not unreasonable for you and your husband to help in spots, if you can, but it is not reasonable to ask you to stop working and become a stay at home mom(with, I am sure, less say so about the kid than a stay at home mom).    \n\n\nDraw the line, to the point of walking away if it comes to that.  Otherwise, you will completely lose your life, and become nothing but child care.  \n\n\nIf you want to have fun, tell her this 'OK, so it sounds like you want me to give up my life and become a full time, unpaid caregiver to your kid.

Sam always knew I did not want to have children of my own. He was fine with it. \n\nHe has a daughter Leah (F25). His wife died when  Leah was 10 years old and I met him when she was 15. I didn't meet her till after a  year of dating. She was a sweet young adult and we got along great. I did not move in with Sam till Leah left for college though. \n\nLeah got pregnant last year. Her boyfriend did not want to keep the baby but she wanted to keep it. He broke up with her. Leah moved back in with us cause she could not afford her lifestyle without him. She worked as a teacher and he was the bread winner. \n\nI had concerns about how she was going to raise a child on a teacher's salary by herself. I suggested getting him to pay child support. She did not want that. Sam thought I should stay out of it. Fine. \n\nBut once she had the baby around 4 months back, Leah seemed to realise having a baby is not the sunshine and rainbows she thought it was. She barely got any sleep during the last four months. All the while Sam was helping her with the baby while I did almost all chores myself. \n\nNow her leave is ending. She did not want to leave baby at daycare or with a nanny. Sam and I both work as well. \n\nShe asked if I could stay home with the baby. I said no. First, it is not my baby, and I never wanted to raise a child. Second, I have work. \n\nShe asked Sam who asked me to do it instead. I refused stating the reasons again. Sam couldn't stay home because he earned more than me and covered more bills. \n\nI asked why Leah can't stay home with the baby herself. She said how she was young and had to build a career. I said many people take breaks to raise kids, and she broke down crying about how she was so tired all the time being a mom and she needed something else in her life too. \n\nSam feels bad for her and thinks we should help her. I suggested she pay for nanny with her income but Leah doesn't want strangers looking after her baby. \n\nBoth of them are pressuring me to stay home with baby so she can go to work. I am standing firm on my decision. \n\nLeah said yesterday how she wished her mom was alive since she would have had her back. She said I didnt love her and my husband is also mad at me. \n\nAITA for refusing to help my stepdaughter with her baby?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

A mother of a small baby being reluctant to use formal childcare really isn\u2019t a mental health issue in and of itself.", "I love my son but you couldn\u2019t pay be to be a SAHM. It\u2019s a tough gig.", "So Op doesn't love baby or Leah because she refuses to quit her job for it?? Because based off what Leah has said already then yes both of these statements are true", "This proposal is totally unacceptable. Please stand your ground. Even if you were the grandmother, trying to force you to parent the child would be totally unacceptable.\n\nThe reality is that your step daughter can't face the idea of all day with her own kid because parenting is hard. She just wants you to do what she can't face so that she doesn't need to feel guilty.\n\nSince your husband has enough money to manage without your income, he can afford to pay for childcare. That is the solution. The fact that she doesn't want a stranger to do this is her problem. The stranger is qualified and would, arguably, do a better job than you would. This is a ridiculous stance.\n\nThere is no way you should quit your job, put your own future in danger, and suffer through parenting another person's kid just because this makes someone else feel better about this decision.\n\nI would die on this hill. I would leave the marriage before this happened. It probably won't come to that, but tell them to stop being ridiculous and hire someone qualified.", "Same. I'm just a few years younger than OP, and I wouldn't have the slightest clue how to care for an infant. Give me a kid who is out of diapers and sure, I could look after them for a bit....but a 4 month old? Only an idiot would entrust that child to me. I feel like every time I read a post on this sub involving caring for a baby, I learn some new way they can die. I refuse to be responsible for that.", "I find the younger the parent, the more \"idealistic\" their vision of parenthood is - they think it's the cute clothes, the awesome baby gear, showing the baby off to everyone, cuddling, etc.\n\nThey don't realize it's a 24/7/365 job, utter exhaustion, lots of changes to your body, lots of mood swings and shifts, etc. I've been married almost 20 years and I'd say the time our marriage was closest to the brink was when we brought our 1st son home. It's such a huge, all encompassing life change, it was a real challenge for both of us. It was a lot easier with our 2nd son because we knew what to expect...\n\nI give single parents a LOT of credit - I have no idea how they do it!", "Finally a comment chain calling Leah out.\n\nGood lord the amount of posts defending Leah like what? Don't blame this on PPD. She's literally asking OP to do something she won't even do herself. And she's not going after child support either.\n\nThey're treating OP like she's a free nanny, like a wife or stepmom. Almost like they don't see her as family.\n\nHere's a very simple answer: \"I was told to stay out of it, so I will continue to stay out of it.\"", "Marriage can end.", "Exactly my thoughts if OP was so hellbent on being child free why did she decide to marry someone who had one even if they're grown they will always be a part of that person's life", "Not necessarily. If he makes it clear beforehand that he has no interest in raising a child, then he has no obligation to do so. \n\nLEAH made the decision to keep it(seemingly based on delusions) and clearly wasn\u2019t interested in listening to anyone else\u2019s opinions on the matter.", "That's important and chilling to think about.", "I have a guess. It's because she's a woman so naturally, she should do it. /s.", "I'm so grateful that my dad told me that he is the obvious and automatic child care solution for my future kids. I don't think I ever would have gotten pregnant if I didn't know that I was going to have support.. then again I live with him but pay my fair share in the house as does my partner. None of the 3 of us can afford to quit our jobs, but thankfully we all work different shifts and have an agreement. He's so excited for a baby to join the household. \n\n\nOPs step daughter is so inconsiderate", "I think dudes should be able to opt out in the first trimester as well, sadly we do not live in that world (at least in the US). Even intentionally baby trapping someone can result in 18 years of child support. \n\nSomeday hopefully both sexes will have a way to turn off their fertility entirely until they both want to have a kid. It should require a conscience decision and effort to make a new human IMO.", ">Not necessarily. If he makes it clear beforehand that he has no interest in raising a child, then he has no obligation to do so.\n\nI think that if a man ejaculates inside a woman then he is through his own actions responsible for whatever happens next regardless of how clearly he indicates that he intends to avoid the life-changing consequences of his actions.\n\nCan you imagine a person driving a car full of people into a wall at 100mph but because he makes it clear before the crash that he has no interest in any consequences, he is totally immune to the outcome of his actions?", "The courts would disagree with you (assuming they\u2019re in the US.) Besides, it seems he only made it clear after-the-fact when she announced her pregnancy. Child support is what happens when you don\u2019t do your part to avoid pregnancy altogether.", "He absolutely has an obligation regardless iof whether or not he wanted the child. Legally he is obligated. FULL STOP.", "I am a SAHM,.I told my teenage daughter that I am raising my two and then I am done raising kids. I would help from time to time, but I am done. Even though I don't see grandkids on the horizon for many years. My mom told me the same thing at 16 yrs old.", "And then she will try to dictate how OP raises her baby lol. It will never be good enough.", "There is nothing to indicate that birth control failed or that he was, god forbid, manipulated into having a baby. So yeah, there IS a possibility that he is not a deadbeat and is just exercising his right to not be a parent.", "In a perfect world, maybe. But trying to force reluctant men to become fathers (or reluctant women to become mothers) only ends in traumatized children\n\nChildren aren't a punishment for having sex.", "His responsibility ended by paying for an abortion. She was the one who chose to make the pregnancy into a baby", "No she has a point. If she takes time off she could lose or delay her tenure.", "Yeah you\u2019re right. You know six years of schooling and taking care of kids is basically babysitting right? It\u2019s not hard at all. You wouldn\u2019t last five seconds being a teacher. So before you go spouting off some thing, you have no idea about\u2026 Being a teacher is a career and there are many things you can do with that.", "Excuse me?  Yes you have a career as a teacher.", "I AM a retired childfree 68F and hell no I would not raise any of my niblings kids. Childrearing was never on my lifetime list of things to do.  If I wasn't willing to do it for myself I damn sure ain't gonna do it for anyone else.", "From a policy perspective, we have decided that both parents owe support to the child because we want to maximize the chance of each child getting the resources they need. Putting the burden of that on the mother in this instance is more fair to the father, but it is not more fair to the child. \n\nThe only way to avoid this would be to allow either party to choose abortion, which I do not think we would find morally acceptable. \n\nBut it is absolutely an unfair situation.   It makes sex inherently more risky for them, doubly unfair because they have fewer contraceptive choices. But unprotected sex had a potential death penalty when a lot of us were teens. Unfairness has been a part of this for a very long time.", "Oh hell no. Dudes can opt out of fatherhood by a) wearing Condoms b)vasectomy c) abstinence. They got lots.of options! Boo to this whole debate.", ">\"paper abortions\"\n\nA stupid term and not even fitting. With an abortion no child exists. A child exists even if child support doesn't get paid. \n\nIts not equal.", ">You\u2019re missing the whole part where women cannot just get abortions on demand most places in America. It\u2019s often incredibly hard for women to access the care they need.\n\nThis is an argument for physical abortion, not against paper abortions. Abortion is a right, and the right to a paper abortion requires the right to a physical abortion, I agree. \n\n>You\u2019re also missing the part where our specific society doesn\u2019t give children of single or poor parents the support they need. \n\nAgain, not an argument against men having the right to a paper abortion, but arguing for the right to healthcare and a much better social safety net, all things the US desperately needs. \n\nI'll also point out that what you are saying is essentially \"men should be denied this right because US public policy sucks.\" \n\n>And these \u201cfeminists\u201d are also missing the part where men are prioritizing their own pleasure over the potential life of a child.\n\nWhat does \"pleasure\" have to do with peoples' choices, post abortion? \n\n>I will reiterate my point: if abortions were free, easily accessible and on demand I would 100% support the idea of getting men being able to opt out when they are told about the fetus.\n\nSince it's totally possible to support both access to abortions for women *and* paper abortions for men, its sounds like we are largely in agreement to me.", "I would 100% be in favor of allowing men to say \u201cI choose not to be a father and I\u2019d like you to get an abortion\u201d (maybe have it notarized so it\u2019s clear they did this from the beginning) IF and only if women got to choose, it was free and easy to get. But a certain portion of our society believes that a non-sentient cells/fetus is more important than a woman whose body has been taken over by ultimately - in 99.9% of cases - HIS choice to have an orgasm. \n\nIn some ways I advocate for more penalties for men so that they will be supportive of that possibility. Many men don\u2019t care about women\u2019s health until it directly impacts them. There should be equality in choice about being a parent, yes. But until women, who bear the 100% of the initial consequences of pregnancy, get a true choice, then men shouldn\u2019t either.", "Call it whatever you want, the term isn't really important.
