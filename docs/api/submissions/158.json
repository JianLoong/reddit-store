We were going to drink and have fun playing some games after a stressful week of college tests. I organized everything to receive them and prepared myself to be a good hostess, I was taught hospitality and to always make sure that the guests were comfortable. Anyway, everyone arrived, we started to eat and talk, until one of the friends gave us the idea to move the furniture from the living room to play with VR, we were going to take turns and watch all of us playing a horror game in VR and laugh at the situation. I started removing the furniture from the living room, there weren't that many, so I asked them to just wait, the help really wasn't needed. Until it was time to carry an old armchair, it was heavier than other furniture, so my sister who lives with me helped me carry it, but I hadn't noticed that there underneath a backpack and a jacket on the armchair there was a Mac. Unfortunately, the accident happened, at a certain moment we tilted the chair too much and everything fell down and the Mac broke. (It doesn't change the situation, but both of us were sober) I was shocked by the situation, so was the owner of the notebook (she is one of my closest friends in the group). The atmosphere became tense, because she was very upset. At the end of the night, after everyone had left, by messages, we were deciding on the prices and how we were going to solve the problem. The next day, I was told about private conversations of other colleagues talking about this situation in which I was called a jerk for not offering to pay for the repair entirely. Until then it was just an unpleasant situation that could be solved quickly, but some people in the group decided to get involved and give their opinions. The only thing I could think of to defend myself in this situation is that the Macbook was in the wrong place, where anyone could sit, totally unprotected without a protective cover or inside the backpack. But I accept the view that I might be wrong, as I could have checked the situation better and taken the objects off the armchair before moving it. Maybe I should be more aware of people and their objects in my home, or maybe people should take care of their personal objects in environments that are not their home, I really don't know, I don't have an opinion. We are still sorting out the financial part, for now we have decided to split expenses in half, but some friends of hers have convinced her that I should take over all the expenses, making the conversation uncomfortable and a bit awkward. This situation is being a bit stressful and creating intrigue with a friend that I wouldn't want to lose. I don't know if I am wrong or right, some friends are divided, some have even said that I shouldn't pay for anything. This is creating intrigue and discussion in our social circle.
