I had recently bought a place to live and so she came to my home with everything that she could carry and I have let her stay at my home ever since. \n\nWhilst she was underage and at school the only thing that she paid for was her food out of her part time job. When she finished school, I gave her a 3 month warning that whilst I would not charge her rent I would expect her to pay half the bills (internet, electricity and water) every single month. She was initially surprised and thought that she would be able to stay for free indefinitely and complained to my mother about it. However, she has since managed to find a job as a PA and the bills works out to  \\~10-15% of her income (I could probably get 4x as much on the market).\n\nMy mother has since called me and told me that she does not like her daughter working to pay my bills like a mule. She said that my sister works for little and still needs to pay for her food, travel for work, save money and also have some money left over for herself as a young lady. She has told me to try to convince my sister to come back (sister refuses point blank) so that she won't have to pay rent and I can rent my room for much more because she wants us both to succeed.\n\nWhen I later complained about this to a friend, he said that I am an asshole because my parents never charged me rent once in 6 years (this is true) which is what has allowed me to buy my home in the first place. He said that I am basically pulling the ladder up behind me by not giving her the same opportunities that I had especially as I earn so much more than her. I responded that the relationship/obligations between siblings is different than between a parent and child but he said that I am just making excuses.\n\nI had all sorts of plans to begin overpaying on my mortgage but I have been unable to because of the sudden expense of supporting her moving in with me. I do love my little sister, am a fair bit older and do earn nearly triple her salary but I still feel like she can contribute towards the household income and clean the communal areas every month like she initially promised.\n\nAre my expectations unreasonable here?", "created_utc": 1702077597, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18dzljx/aita_for_charging_my_sister_18_half_the_bills_for/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In the adult world we have bills and if she wants to live for free she can move in with your parents. You are teaching her a very important life lesson. Now if you have a live in partner/spouse then she should be paying a third rather than half. Otherwise you are doing the right thing.", "NTA\nAt the end of the day she has 3 options, and they are better then 99% of the chances most people get. \nShe could go back home, she doesn\u2019t want to and won\u2019t, but it\u2019s an option.\nShe could pay half utilities and clean, and that\u2019s very fair.\nThe third option is she can get her own place, pay normal rent and her own utilities.\n\nJust because you have a place for her to stay, and helped her out, doesn\u2019t mean you have to.", "I think asking her to split utility bills is fair. She doesn\u2019t want to move back in with your parents, so her choices are pay half of the utilities with you or pay ALL her bills on her own. Seems like a pretty simple choice to me.\n\nAssuming you haven\u2019t left out any important details, you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA. She is an adult with a job. Would that we could all spend only 10-15% of our income on housing, food, and utilities!", "NTA she is finished school and working full-time, correct? And she absolutely should be contributing. If what you are charging her is only 10 to 15% of her income, she is extremely lucky. Most people spend almost all of their income on their bills.\nShe can still save for her and play someday, but if she is working full-time there is no reason for you to let her stay there for free completely.", "NTA. You are 100% correct in that you do not have the same obligation to a sibling that one does to a child. It is unfortunate that your sister is having problems with your dad and can't get the same benefits from living with your parents that you did, but that does not in any way obligate you to provide those benefits in their stead. Frankly I think your mother is wrong to think your sister shouldn't have to pay her way - they aren't just *your* bills! - because that is what being an adult requires, and your sister is legally an adult. We don't have the background on what the problem is between your sister and your father, but I can't see that it could matter: even if your sister would be in danger staying at home, she still has to pay her way in the world.", "NTA\nWhy is she your responsibility when she has a house she can go to (your parents) where it will not be a requirement for her to pay bills, but she has chosen to stay at yours. \n\n\nYour mother has no right to dictate what you do in your house. If she is concerned about your sisters money being swindled from her... then your mother can pay her share...\n\n\nI think it was great that you looked out for her while she was not employed and i would assume you wouldn't have expected her to pay bills while she was not working. \n\n\nTo the people out there that say she should be doing the family thing and just looking after her... what would be the situation if the sister decided she didn't want to work anymore seeing as there are no obligations for her to need to work for?", "YOU are NOT the parent. If your mom cares so much SHE should help you financially. You did well by your sister to take her in and care for her till she came of age. You are only asking that she helps with utilities and food etc. This is something many parents ask of kids once they are of age and get a job. If she refuses to do that? Ok, she needs to move. Good life lesson. NTA", "NTA. Price for that stuff has gone up. however I feel like you should have worked out a deal where she cleans the house instead of bills. Also your mom has no right to use this as a way to force your sister to be around her father.", "This is probably the best way to teach her to be responsible. I think it could be highly beneficial though if you don\u2019t 100% need all the money to put half into a rainy day fund that she can have if it doesn\u2019t get used by the time she moves out", "ESH. You don\u2019t need her money, you could help her out. Your mom trying to get involved when sis can\u2019t live with her. Your sis for expecting to live for free. \n\nI would take her money and do what some parents do; and save it for her when she moves out.", "YTA. Bruh idk if its a culture thing but only in america I have experience the \u201cwhats in it for ME effect\u201d. Its ranges from this not helping your sister, which is family\u2026same blood.. to people being like why should I pay for someone else\u2019s health insurance. You are selfish dude.. sorry to say it. Its weird for a persian to be like this.. in our culture.. we fight over who pays the restaurant bill. Its a well known thing.. lots of skits/content made by persian influencer showcasing literal Dads getting in argument over the bill\u2026 some truly getting upset to their core someone else paid for everyones meal.

Your sense of superiority over your sister is blatant.", "YTA.\n\nYour friend is right. It doesn't sound like you're relying on your sister (or any other possible roommate) to pay your mortgage or anything, just that you're trying to instil your personal sense of adult responsibility in your sister. For starters, that's not really your job. More importantly, though, your friend put their finger on it: your insistence that your sister pay bills to you specifically disallows her from having the opportunity you did.\n\nIt's really hard to justify what appears to be hypocrisy.", "If sister wants to live with you, she can help pay the bills. You are not her parent. She is not obligated to live with you.\n\nIf she doesn't want to pay any bills or thinks it's unfair, then she can suck it up and move back home.

Is she able to attend college/university in her current situation?\n\nTo me it really boils down to the argument and the reason your sister moved out.

Charging only half of utilities plus her own food is still supporting her a lot. Especially if it only equates to about 15% of her income...", "NTA.

Upon arriving in the USA, I got a private job which paid $1200 a month and I was asked to pay rent immediately ( $600) to sleep in an  attic and to buy my own food, plus contributed $50 towards electricity.", "Since when is 10-15% of your income \"out the ass\"?", "Half the utilities and none of the rent and she gets to own half the house? That's pretty ridiculous. I tell you what, I'll pay 50% of your utilities for half ownership of your house.", "More info needed.  Are you male or female, and was your dad violent to you?    Because if your male and your dad was threatening violence and now you're not there, you know that he probably is being violent or is always a hairs breadth away from that, right?  And maybe you're not willing to give your own sister safe haven from that without giving her the same financial advantage you had.  \n\nAnd if you're a man, you know that you know that statistically it is highly likely that you will always earn more than her for the same reason that your father threatens violence. I think it's fine to teach her financial responsibility and she should have a job. \n\nBut, and here's where more info is needed, did you get to go to school and get qualifications that allowed you to earn 3 times what she earns while your parents covered your expenses?  Or get training for your current career?  I'm getting the sense that your friend knows that you're kind of entitled and think your sister doesn't deserve to have the good start you got for some reason.  So, I'm leaning to YTA just because the world is a cruel place to young women right now and I'd move heaven and earth to protect and support any young relative who needed that from me, but apparently you just see someone busting your groove.", "I dunno dude...
