It's the weekend, so my 14 year old step son doesn't have school and was just in the house, doing his own thing. We crossed paths a couple of times but weren't hanging out. Nature happened, and my nipples got hard. I know, what a horror. My husband (34M) says it was inappropriate for me not to wear a bra with a tight shirt on while his son is home. Mind you, I usually don't wear a bra. Not even in public. When I do, it's a bralette that you can still see my nipples through if they get hard, so it wouldn't have made much of a difference. I guess it's just that this was a tight tank top, although it was high neck, so there wasn't cleavage (not that I have much anyway). I asked my husband if his son had said anything to him about it; if he said he was uncomfortable about it, I might have changed my shirt. But he said no, his son hadnt said anything, but that he (my husband) noticed it right away and didnt want his son to see, and he asked me to go put a looser t shirt on instead. \n\nI said no, this is my body in its natural state, I'm not doing anything wrong, inappropriate, or sexual by existing in my own home. It's not like my shirt is see-through. It's a black tank top. I told him that if he's worried about his teenage son's perception of my body and perhaps his inappropriate thoughts, maybe he should have a conversation with HIM, not me. I didn't change my shirt, my husband's mad at me and hasnt spoken to me since (I'm assuming he won't  until I change), and he says I'm being an asshole for not changing my shirt and choosing to \"show off my nipples to his kid.\" His son doesn't even seem to have noticed to be honest. \n\nSo, am I the asshole for wearing a tank top around my stepson and refusing to change my shirt?", "created_utc": 1680485480, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12a5bl3/aita_for_wearing_a_shirt_without_a_bra_in_front/", "score": 107, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To assume his son is sexualizing you instead of allowing or assuming his son to be, I don\u2019t know, a uninterested teenager is an interesting choice. Maybe a conversation with your husband should be in order.", "NTA. And your husband needs to grow up and stop trying to police your body. Also it's really weird that he's sexualizing you and speaking on behalf of your stepson who's literally not said anything. Kind of a red flag as far as trying to guilt/manipulate this situation like you're the bad guy. He's the only one making this awkward and being unreasonable.", "NTA. Why do people get so offended by female nipples lol, at least ours have a legitimate function.

Is he going to teach him to shame his girlfriend for every natural thing that happens with her body too?", "NTA.  It's your body.  Women have nipples just like men do.  Sometimes nipples get hard on women AND men.  Whether your husband or stepson is uncomfortable is not your responsibility.  It's your body.  If you don't want to wear a bra then you don't have to.  I think this is a really good opportunity for your husband to talk to his stepson about bodily autonomy and how to not objectify women.", "NTA, though your step-son *definitely* noticed your nipples.\n\nThe fact that he didn't make a big deal of it is a good sign for the boy.", "NTA, and I'm honestly disturbed by the implications your husband is making about his own son.", "NTA. The only person who has a problem is your husband. Gross insinuation on his part.", "NTA- If stepson is unbothered, that's actually awesome because he won't sexualize those who aren't in that market for him, and he'll save that for his own relationships. If your husband has this issue, it means he's probably sexualizing women who aren't you, and has a sort of pseudo claim (in his mind) that he has control over you since you are his wife.", "NTA.

And then there are all these stories of affairs between high school students and older teachers.  \n\nI get all that, but fundamentally, this is about his insecurity. You're in your own home, not crossing any boundaries. He either trusts you to make good decisions or he doesn't. It's his problem not yours.\n\nBTW, if stepson is turned on by you, he's not going to tell his dad, so asking your husband what his son is thinking won't tell you much. Even if stepson thinks you're hot, your husband should trust you to do the right thing and stop policing what you wear.", "NAH. \n\nStepson has noticed. Everyone notices, regardless of shirt color. Most people just don't say anything. Guaranteed that stepson isn't super enthused about your not wearing a bra and it's probably awkward for him.

These are people you (presumably) care about and there's no reason to intentionally make them uncomfortable. \n\nA bit of speculation here - If your partner mentioned something even though his son hasn't there's a decent chance that your partner feels uncomfortable and is trying to explain it through his son. Something like \"I don't like my son seeing her like this but if I say it that way she'll think I'm controlling so let's pin this on the kid she won't actually get mad at and could have a valid reason\". What he said wouldn't be a good way to communicate that but that's my thoughts on the situation. \n\nEither way it's your decision but if there's even a chance of making someone feel uncomfortable in this way, is this particular thing worth fighting for? No hate either way if it's important to you go for it and stand your ground!

A Teenaged boy won\u2019t notice your hard nipples through your t shirt and not fantasize about them? You could have a sack over your head and he will notice those.

The kid isn't going to die from seeing a shadow of a nipple, he'll be fine", "NTA but you have to understand that hard nipples through a tight shirt are definitely gonna be on a 14 year old boys radar.
