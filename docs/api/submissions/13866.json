I actually don\u2019t think looser shirt or a less structured bra is an unreasonable ask. But there\u2019s a good chance some level of nip/boob outline would still be visible with either of those options which it sounds like the partner here might still complain about.", "It\u2019s a bra.

A boy being uncomfortable at a woman existing does not give ANYONE the right to dictate what she wears in her home. ESPECIALLY when she was wearing normal clothes?? Duh. \n\nSince you aren't attracted to women, or seem to see them as people, let's break it down in a different way and see if it gets through to you.\n\nA man is in his own home, wearing a tank top, and GASP, you can see his nipples through it. \n\nDoes he have to change because someone might be uncomfortable?\n\nP.S.- not being attracted to women doesn't mean you can just dismiss them as people. we're all human, buddy. get over whatever weird chip you've got on your shoulder.", "> I was bringing those up to prove a point that I have very little interaction with women in general outside of my mother and aunt, we never really talked about this kind of stuff because it never really applied to me \n\nI'm sorry does being gay prevent you from having women as friends?\n\nthe implication here is that the only way you'd know anything about women is if you had a sister, dated woman, or were a woman yourself. but women make up literally half the population, so you having little interaction with women indicates a problem with you and your views on women\n\n> I wouldn't really know what is or isn't comfortable\n\nso they why the fuck were you assuming? like man you can't have it every way here. if you're truly and completely ignorant about a topic, why on earth make assumptions? \n\n>  no I wasn't operating under the assumption that Op was wearing things that would make her uncomfortable..... I was just making assumptions based off of what I would imagine would be comfortable IE loose-fitting clothing\n\nyou brought this up in the specific context of what OP should or should not be wearing around the house and wondered that her current method of dressing would actually be less comfortable than the clothes you want her to wear\n\nso nah, this wasn't just a random harmless assumption about what it's like to wear particular clothes and maybe if you know nothing about something you shouldn't be making wild assumptions\n\nyou're up and down in this thread making dozens and dozens of comments arguing against it being ok for OP to wear a tank top in her home. you're being aggressively misogynistic all over the place and arguing that women have to go out of their way to make their bodies not visible or men and boys can't be comfortable"]}
