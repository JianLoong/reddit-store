There\u2019s a dog park about 5ish minutes from my parents\u2019 house, where I take my dog, Fritz (my parents house him bc my apartment doesn\u2019t allow German shepherds). It\u2019s a nice park tbh, the enclosed play area for the dogs is on a hill and really big. Plenty of room to run.\n\nFritz isn\u2019t a very social-play kinda dog, he just likes fetch. We chill, we mind our business. Sometimes dogs like to pick on him but he\u2019s very patient, I swear. Gentle giant. Sometimes other dogs see us and want to join. A lot of people don\u2019t really interact with their dogs, not really my business but maybe your dog wouldn\u2019t be such an aggressive player if you threw the ball yourself, yk? It\u2019s fine though, if the dog is good I don\u2019t mind at all. I love dogs.\n\nToday, Fritz and I are doing what we always do, I\u2019m standing at the top of the hill throwing balls for Fritz. I think it\u2019s important to note that I bring Fritz\u2019s own toys (2 tennis balls and a Chuckit!\u2122) because he has a problem with letting go of a ball unless you have another one already loaded, and when it\u2019s time to go he wants to hold onto his most recent catch. A dog (I think it\u2019s name was Riley) comes up, and starts immediately snapping in my dog\u2019s face, trying to literally bite the ball out of his mouth. I try to offer her a different ball and she ignores me. So I call out \u201cwhose dog is this?\u201d A woman (around 26-30 I think) says it\u2019s hers, and I ask (very politely, I don\u2019t like being rude) if she can get her dog. She seems annoyed but calls Riley over. We go back to playing, yada yada. Now Riley is actively chasing Fritz, biting him, jumping on him, and probably scaring him a bit given how he dropped the ball and backed away with his ears down. I look over and see the woman is totally ignoring her dog and talking to her friend. Fritz finally gets to me and Riley is still doing it. Fritz is much bigger, and I can tell he\u2019s getting pissed off. I know I\u2019m in trouble if he snaps at her bc, yk, German shepherd vs \u201csmedium\u201d mixed breed.\n\nI yell to the lady \u201chey, can you get your dog?\u201d This time the woman is definitely annoyed, and as she\u2019s literally dragging her dog away says \u201cmaybe you shouldn\u2019t do that here.\u201d I ask what. She says \u201cplay individual games.\u201d I say \u201cat a park?\u201d She says \u201cyou can do that at the soccer field\u201d (there\u2019s a \u201cno dogs allowed\u201d sign on the gate). I say \u201cmaybe you should pay attention to your dog more.\u201d At that point I decide to pack up and go, because honestly it\u2019s not worth the trouble and Fritz was done for the day anyway. As I\u2019m passing, the friend goes \u201cyou didn\u2019t have to be snarky.\u201d \u201cGirl fuck off\u201d slips out before I can even stop myself. I quickly leave. Obviously I\u2019m not proud of saying that, I usually am not aggressive. My friends and sister say I was totally in bounds but my parents say that it was totally rude and I should never talk to people like that.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1670106347, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbsn52/aita_for_being_snarky_to_a_stranger_at_the_dog/", "score": 146, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My last dog was a jerk and would pick on other dogs, so I would only go to a dog park when no one else was there, then he could safely get his energy out and we'd leave before anyone approached us.

Dogs left unattended, are more likely to be aggressive. However, again there are dogs that owners make it a habit of ensuring their dog's aggression toward others. I don't see that kind of behavior with MOST pitbull or bulldog owners, because there are too many people like you who associate behavior to breed and go \"the sky is falling\" about seeing one in person.", "Here\u2019s a stat for you.

NTA times 1000", "We always joked that the local dog park was \u201cdoggie fight club\u201d, bc most owners didn\u2019t want to talk about what happened.", "The rescue I foster for has a no dog parks clause in their foster responsibility and liability agreement because of how bad they are. They'll sue the shit out of you for vet bills.", "Also, if you aren\u2019t paying attention, you aren\u2019t seeing them poop and you aren\u2019t cleaning it up.", "\n\n>\"When you lose control of your pet, you lose control of the outcome.\"\n\nThat's a great saying, thanks for sharing it!", "It\u2019s not uncommon here to bring your own toys to the park, I\u2019m not the only one who does it, and there are toys also laid out that were donated to the dog park", "I agree with this, and with ESH. Dog parks are for dogs to play with each other. There are a number of owners in my neighborhood who take their very skittish, unsociable, elderly and frail dogs to the dog park, ans they get upset when another dog tries to play with them. \n\nThere\u2019s an \u201cowner issue\u201d that\u2019s strangely common where I live\u2014some owners (mostly women, tbh) are under the impression that chasing, roughhousing, jumping, and humping are somehow abnormal behaviour, and get really upset at owners of energetic dogs. As an owner, you can tell pretty quickly if the other dog isn\u2019t into it, and then you just call your own dog off or redirect, but often it\u2019s the owners who have a real problem. We once had a lady freak out at us and literally scream at my dog, when my mutt ran up and started humping her much bigger dog (who just stood there and didn\u2019t look remotely phased). Once she started shrieking, my dog got really freaked out, jumped off, and started barking. Then he perceived this pair as a threat. Now we can\u2019t even pass them in the street without my dog losing his mind, and they live four doors down from us. Friends of ours with all different kinds of dogs have experienced similar human behaviour at the dog parks. It\u2019s frustrating for human and dog alike.", "Honestly I think Fritz would have been able to defend himself, but my fear was that he *would,* and then *we* would get in trouble for it. He\u2019s a scary looking lad with his teeth bared I will admit, but he has only ever been on defensive mode, never offensive. Thank you for your input though, and you are still right, Riley still could have ended up hurting him!!", "The problem isn\u2019t that the dog was chasing a ball. The problem was that the dog was chasing a ball in my dog\u2019s mouth, and was biting him to make him drop it. I would have gladly played with her if she was actually playing, but she was actively on my dog, scaring him, and he wasn\u2019t able to play because of that", "But you can sure as hell train a dog not to bite at other dog\u2019s faces. If you\u2019re dog is aggressive towards other canines, they have no business being at a dog park", "I mean ur not wrong either way I guess \ud83d\ude2d", "Holy shit wow. Talk about doing way too much. Thank you for your input!!", "Most of the people saying e s h have been focusing on me bringing toys. I didn\u2019t know it was so unusual to bring balls and a chuckit for your dog who will only play with balls and a chuckit lol", "Lots of people bring their own toys. Some dogs just aren't interested in what's there that many other dogs use. \n\nMy bf and his mom bring their own toys when bringing her dog to the park. They also share when appropriate and leave when appropriate. \n\nHonestly, same with kids at a playground. You don't have to share, the kids (and dogs) should be taught (trained) to leave it when someone doesn't want to share.", "Agreed, and I literally stated that I was fine with sharing \ud83d\ude2d"]}
