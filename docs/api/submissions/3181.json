I am a 39 year old mother to three. In 2020 I lost my mother to COVID and at that point my father became more miserable than he already was. The decision was made that my husband, our kids and I would move in with my father. Even before mom was sick he was needing more and more help on the farm. So for the past year I\u2019ve been full time taking care of my father and my kids and running the family business. My husband has been helping me at least with the farm side of things, but if I need a break from everything else he complains he\u2019s been working all week and he wants to go fishing or do anything but help me raise our kids and keep our home clean.\n\nIt\u2019s all been too much for me to do alone. My older brother somewhat recently retired from the USMC after over twenty years and I had been talking him into coming home to help out, because I do understand that there\u2019s a lot of work falling on my husband. Now there\u2019s a lot of family history but my brother and father left off on bad terms and he hasn\u2019t been home since he was a teen. But I convinced him and he came back, and brought his husband, about two months ago. Only now he\u2019s looking to leave again. Our father wasn\u2019t very welcoming but we expected that and otherwise everything was going alright until it wasn\u2019t.\n\nWhatever happened it was about a week ago, and all my brother he told me was if he ain\u2019t wanted he had nothing keeping him here. So I come to find out from my husband that he had told my brother to back off and that we don\u2019t need the help of some gays, except when he said it to me he used the f word. Now I'm not saying my husband is a saint and I knew his thoughts on homosexuals but I never once thought he would act like that towards anyone, much less my own brother. And we absolutely need all the help we can get right now. I convinced my brother to try staying longer, and I told my husband and my father they need to get their shit together and until they start trying I\u2019m not doing anything around the house any longer, only the absolute bare minimum for my father\u2019s health needs.\n\nI don\u2019t think they believed me at all and now my husband is all pissed that I didn\u2019t make a God damned thing for thanksgiving. I haven\u2019t even gotten any groceries. My kids are mostly old enough to fend for themselves, the oldest is 16 and the youngest is 9, though I did make sure there was at least some food around that the kids can make. And of course my husband is a grown man and can cook dinner for his family, but instead he chose to disappear off somewhere in a rage. It\u2019s not even been that long and I\u2019m wondering now what I\u2019m even doing and if I should be the one to cave in, if I\u2019m the one being more of the asshole. We\u2019ve never had a thanksgiving as terrible as this and I\u2019m feeling it\u2019s all on me.", "created_utc": 1669348044, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4314g/aita_for_refusing_to_any_work_around_the_house/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Please try it OP!", "Wholehearted agreement!", "I think the father is the bigot", "I never believed he would say a thing like that. When my brother told the family about 10 years ago my husband just said that's his choice and left it at that. We both told our kids they will always be loved by us and should never feel afraid to be themselves after learning what a hard time my brother had with it. I knew my husband didn't understand but I never would have thought him to be that kind of man. And my brother is an adult so I don't appreciate the assumption that I lured him. I'm not saying it's a great situation but I am saying he did understand going in that our father at least wasn't all too pleased with him showing up, their relationship is complicated. And he knows how our town is having grown up here. So he understood what he was getting into and I didn't try and mislead him.", "OP\u2019s thoughts that her husband would never act like that is actually quite reasonable. A lot of people who have racist/homophobic leaning thoughts keep the opinions but don\u2019t act on them because of social norms, keeping the peace and just basic human decency. Just like how we all probably have a family member we don\u2019t really like but don\u2019t say anything and just put up with. Only if we really really can\u2019t stand them then we voice up and act on it. OP probably thought husband was the type that can disagree but not act like an asshole especially to family", "My oldest takes care of the horses because they're mostly her horses for barrel racing and her other events, she's not actively working on the farm except for baling time and that's a bit of a community affair and all hands on deck in the summer. But yes I agree she's too much of a parent to the other kids and that's on me. \n\nAnd it's true that I knew my husband doesn't understand homosexuality and thinks its a choice, but I also thought he was a good Christian man and above judging others and especially name calling. \n\nAnd the longevity of all this is something I'm worried about. My father was evidently mismanaging this place and his taxes for years, my BIL is an accountant and he's been helping me sort through everything and honestly you're right we can't afford help and I don't know how we're going to make this work.", "My dad is a grudge holder and he's still mad my brother up and enlisted instead of staying home since otherwise it was just me left here since our oldest brother had died. He expected him to take on the family business and he feels abandoned and claims even God has forsaken him by taking his good son and leaving him with nothing but trouble. They seemed to be mending their relationship a bit at one point but that progress ended when he told the family about his lifestyle and my father just said he should have been the son to die. I know it's not right but my brother is a grown man and he did know a bit what he was getting himself into, though again I didn't know how bad my husband was about it but my brother knew my husband thinks it's a choice he made. I'm not trying to make excuses but I feel like I'm being made out to seem like I sugar coated it and lied to him to get him to come home. He knew what this place is like, but I'm not gonna blame him if he ends up leaving since I do understand it's hostile.", "My kids do a fairly good job with their chores, the youngest we joke is a bit of a hurricane but I think his ADHD makes it hard for him. I worry about my oldest daughter, especially over the last couple of years she has started acting like a mom to the younger two and I don't want to be doing that to her. I never have to tell her twice to do something and she's usually up before dawn out in the barn taking care of the horse chores out there. She's so serious all the time and I want her to be my little baby for just a bit longer. \n\nI told him he needs to apologize for saying that and he was saying it's just a fact what he said. But I know he has to know how mean it was of him to say that, and based on what we'd discussed before I thought we both believed it's not our place to judge and we're not above judgment ourselves. I thought I knew him to be a better man than that. And even after he said it my brother is still around helping keep everything together for now and I think my husband is embarrassed to see that after the way he acted to him my brother is still stepping up. He's too proud to admit when he needs help and I'm worried about him wherever he is right now.\n\nI'm sorry about you mom, I miss mine everyday and I have no idea how she mostly held this family all together. Wish I could ask her advice from Heaven.", "Well said.", "I am keeping an eye on the kids and making sure they're eating enough. I'm just not making big meals, but I've still been having him fix himself some cereal for breakfast and helped him make some canned soup. Obviously I'm not trying to punish him, although he could learn to better pick up after himself, but I get that he's a child and not a grown man.", "????\n\n>Frankly everybody but your husband and his spouse aren't assholes.\n\nDid you mean brother and his spouse? The way this reads is OP's husband and his spouse (OP) are not assholes.", "The husband used the f-word with BIL.  I think this is a case of both of them being bigots.", "Did you guilt your brother, though? People put up with a lot of shit from family that they would never put up with from anyone else.", "You sell everything, put your dad in assisted living, leave your bigot husband and free your poor brother from working on his bigot fathers farm, being called slurs by his brother in law", "Your dad told your brother he should have died? Because of his \u2018lifestyle\u2019? (I presume you mean his sexuality, which isn\u2019t actually a lifestyle.)\n\nAm I understanding correctly? So both your husband *and* your father are homophobic, *and* your father has told your brother he should have died.\n\nEditing original post to include your father in the AH count.", "I wish we could both ask advice from people in heaven. \n\nI'm sorry, but homophobic people make me cringe. According to things like [third](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/21/opinion/sunday/bible-prohibit-gay-sex.html) that I've read, the original Biblical texts weren't against homosexuality. Or at least not so vehemently against it as is taught by too many churches today. \n\nPeople always say, \"The Bible says it's a sin! If you approve of them,  you'll go to hell with them!\" The Bible says not to judge, that you'll be judged by the scale you use to judge others, and to be kind. It also says wearing mixed fabrics is a sin, but they're happy to keep rocking that polyblend. It's something some parts of society has chosen to hate. But imo nothing excuses verbally abusing someone, and that's what your husband did to your brother. \n\nGood luck with all that. May your husband's heart be filled with kindness, patience, helpfulness, and humility.", "Yeah I screwed that up pretty good, didn't I?", "I didn't intend to if I did. We always talked over the phone at least once a week and I would update him on everything happening back home. He mentioned a few times being bored out of his mind being retired and I would aways say there's work around here if he wants it, and we would sometimes talk about running the family business together. When dad got worse off I did talk about how much more work there was for me to do and that's about when he decided to move here, but my intent wasn't to guilt him since like I said I'd been talking about that kind of stuff for years with him.", "I don\u2019t think it should matter if OP did \u2018guilt\u2019 the brother. Because it sounds like OP is going through a tough time wshouldering all the responsibilities of work, childcare and taking care of her father. If OP needs to ask and persuade brother for some help, it\u2019s not unreasonable.", "Well I don't know what exactly he said to my brother because they're both tight lipped about it, all I know is that's what he told me later was that he wished he died and my other brother was alive. It's something he'd said before knowing that too though so it's not only about his sexuality. And sorry for saying lifestyle I know that's not the proper thing to say I didn't mean it to come across rude.", "Oh I agree with that so much. I have tried for years to convince my father that it's people's hatred which has caused them to use the Bible to perpetuate that hate. Jesus welcomed prostitutes and lepers after all. It's not my job to decide who is right or wrong, I am here to put love into the world and that's all I wish to do. I thought my husband and I were on the same page in that regard and I am appalled he was willing to say that and more so that he doubled down and didn't see what he did is wrong. I just don't know how to get him to understand this.", "It still doesn't make sense", "Exactly. He didn't see what he did was wrong?? Sounds like he has major pride problems."]}
