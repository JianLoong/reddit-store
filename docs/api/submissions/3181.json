{"id": 3181, "submission_id": "z4314g", "title": "AITA for refusing to any work around the house and not making my family thanksgiving dinner?", "selftext": "I\u2019m fed up with the men in my life. I am a 39 year old mother to three. In 2020 I lost my mother to COVID and at that point my father became more miserable than he already was. The decision was made that my husband, our kids and I would move in with my father. Even before mom was sick he was needing more and more help on the farm. So for the past year I\u2019ve been full time taking care of my father and my kids and running the family business. My husband has been helping me at least with the farm side of things, but if I need a break from everything else he complains he\u2019s been working all week and he wants to go fishing or do anything but help me raise our kids and keep our home clean.\n\nIt\u2019s all been too much for me to do alone. My older brother somewhat recently retired from the USMC after over twenty years and I had been talking him into coming home to help out, because I do understand that there\u2019s a lot of work falling on my husband. Now there\u2019s a lot of family history but my brother and father left off on bad terms and he hasn\u2019t been home since he was a teen. But I convinced him and he came back, and brought his husband, about two months ago. Only now he\u2019s looking to leave again. Our father wasn\u2019t very welcoming but we expected that and otherwise everything was going alright until it wasn\u2019t.\n\nWhatever happened it was about a week ago, and all my brother he told me was if he ain\u2019t wanted he had nothing keeping him here. So I come to find out from my husband that he had told my brother to back off and that we don\u2019t need the help of some gays, except when he said it to me he used the f word. Now I'm not saying my husband is a saint and I knew his thoughts on homosexuals but I never once thought he would act like that towards anyone, much less my own brother. And we absolutely need all the help we can get right now. I convinced my brother to try staying longer, and I told my husband and my father they need to get their shit together and until they start trying I\u2019m not doing anything around the house any longer, only the absolute bare minimum for my father\u2019s health needs.\n\nI don\u2019t think they believed me at all and now my husband is all pissed that I didn\u2019t make a God damned thing for thanksgiving. I haven\u2019t even gotten any groceries. My kids are mostly old enough to fend for themselves, the oldest is 16 and the youngest is 9, though I did make sure there was at least some food around that the kids can make. And of course my husband is a grown man and can cook dinner for his family, but instead he chose to disappear off somewhere in a rage. It\u2019s not even been that long and I\u2019m wondering now what I\u2019m even doing and if I should be the one to cave in, if I\u2019m the one being more of the asshole. We\u2019ve never had a thanksgiving as terrible as this and I\u2019m feeling it\u2019s all on me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEditing this to say I didn\u2019t expect this to get so big overnight. And I\u2019m hearing what y\u2019all are saying and I am concerned for my brother and BIL, how they\u2019re bring treated was one of my main issues in why I started this. My husband came home last night with thanksgiving leftovers from our pastor\u2019s home. Apparently he got some good sense talked into him. He\u2019s saying he hasn\u2019t been a good man to me like he vowed and he\u2019s going to do better by me and our kids and our pastor also told him he needs to mend the damage he\u2019s done with my brother. Last night he said he knew it was hurtful what he said and he has a lot of anger in him that he doesn\u2019t know what to do with but he knows he needs to go apologize and that\u2019s what he\u2019s off to do this morning. And I know he doesn\u2019t come across well in what I wrote, but he is a sweet man and it\u2019s only the last couple years we\u2019ve had any issues. For anyone saying I\u2019m terrible for marrying him, I was 19 at the time and he never acted like this. I also didn\u2019t know about my brother\u2019s homosexuality then, he only told us that much later and he\u2019s not someone you could tell that sort of thing about him, no offense.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother addition because I want to say one more time that my kids are alright, I didn\u2019t completely abandon them. They know how to do laundry, cook food, clean up after themselves, all of that. They were raised farm kids, they\u2019ve grown up in 4-H and FFA and we\u2019re not new to a farm. They have age appropriate chores and time to play. I didn\u2019t get them fresh produce for one week but there is food in our home we have a pantry with plenty of canned and preserved food. They also have a father who should be able to fix them something. I told my husband I wouldn\u2019t make dinner last night and I meant that. I don\u2019t know why so many think I didn\u2019t support my brother. Maybe it\u2019s on me I am not the best with words. When I learned what my husband said to my brother I was disgusted at him for using that kind of language. This is why I told my husband I am not doing any more housework until he straightens out his act, he apologizes man to man, and then he makes it up to me and starts to appreciate everything I do around here too. My oldest learned what was said and she supports what I am trying to do. For anyone worried my children would grow up to be hateful bigots they are not, they are sweet. They have zero problems with my brother and my son actively adores him and he says he wants to be just like his uncle and be a marine too. My son took to my brother very quickly and he doesn't see anything wrong with my brother's orientation because I raised him to know there is not a thing wrong about it.", "created_utc": 1669348044, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z4314g/aita_for_refusing_to_any_work_around_the_house/", "score": 1967, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I knew my husband didn't understand but I never would have thought him to be that kind of man. And my brother is an adult so I don't appreciate the assumption that I lured him. I'm not saying it's a great situation but I am saying he did understand going in that our father at least wasn't all too pleased with him showing up, their relationship is complicated.

Just like how we all probably have a family member we don\u2019t really like but don\u2019t say anything and just put up with.

They seemed to be mending their relationship a bit at one point but that progress ended when he told the family about his lifestyle and my father just said he should have been the son to die. I know it's not right but my brother is a grown man and he did know a bit what he was getting himself into, though again I didn't know how bad my husband was about it but my brother knew my husband thinks it's a choice he made. I'm not trying to make excuses but I feel like I'm being made out to seem like I sugar coated it and lied to him to get him to come home.

I never have to tell her twice to do something and she's usually up before dawn out in the barn taking care of the horse chores out there. She's so serious all the time and I want her to be my little baby for just a bit longer. \n\nI told him he needs to apologize for saying that and he was saying it's just a fact what he said. But I know he has to know how mean it was of him to say that, and based on what we'd discussed before I thought we both believed it's not our place to judge and we're not above judgment ourselves. I thought I knew him to be a better man than that. And even after he said it my brother is still around helping keep everything together for now and I think my husband is embarrassed to see that after the way he acted to him my brother is still stepping up.

If you approve of them,  you'll go to hell with them!\" The Bible says not to judge, that you'll be judged by the scale you use to judge others, and to be kind. It also says wearing mixed fabrics is a sin, but they're happy to keep rocking that polyblend. It's something some parts of society has chosen to hate.

The going behind your back to express ANY bad opinion to your brother/BIL, especially homophobic, get-gone ones? HUGE RED FLAG. The needing a pastor/ religious person to point out he was an AH, and needed to apologize to you AND your brother/BIL? Red flag. The homophobia alone is awful and should be a deal-breaker. The rest just says you have a major problem with your husband's core values,  but like many have been taught to ignore/excuse what isn't convenient to what you think SHOULD be and to make excuses instead of demanding the respect YOU deserve in your relationship.  Don't let your husband walk back into your life without not only the therapy, but also apologizing to You, your brouther and your BIL AND showing actual change. Talk to your brother and BIL, make it clear that you don't agree with your husband's statements, knew nothing about them and ask them to help you keep a firm stance on the subject. If your husband goes around you again, they tell you immediately and you kick him out, forever. Don't accept the homophobia or the disrespect, his presence teaches your children both are ok.

Frankly, this should probably be the FIRST step. \n\n* *He is not a good man* because he is a hateful bigot and he is teaching your children to hate (as well as demonstrating that he will hate them if they love in a way he approved of). \n\n* *He is not a good husband* because he can see you are drowning with an excessive workload and he does not care. In fact, he sees that you are struggling and instead of helping he insults the only support system you have and pushes your brother to leave. You are not a loved one he wants to help, you are a lowly woman who exists to serve him and facilitate his pleasant life. This is the truth of how he sees you.\n\n* *He is not a good father* because he does not actually contribute to his family or the household. Working is not being a parent. He also does not show them that a good man takes care of his wife, instead he teaches his children that a man is entitled to use his wife. He is teaching your boys to treat women without respect, and teaching your girl to expect to be treated with disrespect. It's on you to break this cycle.\n\nSo, get rid of the asshole husband. Sell the farm. Put your father in a good care home. And show your children that you are actually a person worthy of respect and love, not a lowly servant to be used which is the dynamic they currently see.\n\nBe brave so you and your children can live a happier life.

Sounds like barely-tolerant, rather than accepting.\n\nI do think you really need to look at your own beliefs and assess whether you're harbouring some homophobia (or heteronormativity or straight-superiority) and whether you're able to be an effective ally to your brother and BIL. From what you've demonstrated so far, it's questionable.", "ur husband is a loser", "I\u2019m not really sure how you got labeled the asshole here but I will say GOOD FOR YOU!!!!! I deal with a similar circumstance in being the only one who does anything but my kids are both under 3 yrs old so I do a lot bc I don\u2019t want them to suffer. However. Never back down always stand your ground bc you cave once and he will forever know all he has to do is wait you out. NTA!!!!!!!!!", "Soft NTA. It's the fact that you tried establishing boundaries that I agree with once it became obvious husband did something terrible, but it's sad that you wouldn't stand up for yourself when you shouldered all the family, house and farm.  By reading your edit, I'm glad husband has turned around some and admitted to his anger, good step 1! Fingers crossed for you, hope it will turn out well.", "Well your 16 yo is old enough to start helping on a farm. And you convinced/manipulated your brother to come help around the house instead of respecting the boundary he had with his father? Why not sell the farm and move someplace where you can hire a stay at home nurse or something? And figure what\u2019s more important your brother and his husband being respected and accepted as they are or your husband throwing a tantrum because the world doesn\u2019t revolve around him?\nThis post doesn\u2019t sit right with me it feels more like whining than actually trying to figure out if you\u2019re ta. There are other solutions if you were that bothered you should bring up up to your brother and husband and come up with a game plan.\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for not making it thanksgiving dinner I do think you are for what you\u2019re putting your brother through. Obviously very unaware of how traumatic it can be being surrounded by those who judge you. And your little \u201cyou can\u2019t tell he\u2019s gay no offense\u201d comment wasn\u2019t cute just seems to echo your husbands homophobia. Stereotypes are harmful and the reason all these shootings keep happening.", "ESH minus brother and his husband.... you said you knew his thoughts on homosexuals.. \"two peas in a pod\" they say.... brother should go NC with you guys and also feel sorry for those kids... having parents like you...", "You go, girl! \n\nNTA but your husband and dad are massive AHs", "He did or is doing just that.", "Kind of annoying how the bot marked her as an asshole because of your comment", "Exactly. The villains in this story are winning. Time to change the script.", "Great post, I try not to comment on reddit because it's so truth toxic...but i am to say bravo to your note.", "I hear what you\u2019re saying. But also, I think most of us would agree that it\u2019s very obvious when someone\u2019s gay sometimes and not so obvious sometimes. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that! And also that sometimes we\u2019re just wrong about those assumptions anyway. I don\u2019t think what she said is inherently offensive or wrong and I don\u2019t think she meant it that way.", "NTA\n\nA 19yo girl (yes, a teenager!) married someone who was a really great guy, other than a massive red flag of being a bigot (which could've been a comment about being uncomfortable around gay men etc.). Eldest child is 16 & the family is welcomed by the local pastor, so I'm assuming OP is now at least late 30s.\n\nThe family business is a farm, so sounds like a small community (who have been open & welcoimg to her brother because everyone knows everyone) where there weren't many openly gay people & her husband hasn't been forced into close contact to expose the true extent of his bigotry. In those cultures, issues like bigotry are often resistant to change & take a long time.\n\nShe's a mum of 3, running a farm, & sounds like she's doing most of the domestic duties for a house of 6. She's working bloody hard, has a close relationship with her brother who's just finished in the military & wants to share the family business (labour & profits) with him & his partner. Welcoming those men into her children's lives is a great way to ensure they don't follow in their father & maternal grandfather's footsteps as bigots.\n\n\nCalls for a divorce at this point are outright naive. Counselling for the husband would be a hell of a lot less traumatic for her kids than \"Dad's a bad person because of how he treats uncle, therefore he's no longer dad\".", "Yes this is what I mean, that he is not very obvious so I had no reason to think he would be a homosexual. But if he did act differently that wouldn\u2019t be a problem and I wasn\u2019t trying to imply that it would be or that he needs to act any which way to please others. All I wanted to say was I truly did not know until he told me.", "Maybe it\u2019s because you didn\u2019t grow up in a Christian home, you and the other comments saying it, but saying God made you a certain way is  supposed to be confidence building, used it a lot. You don\u2019t like your red hair, or freckles, or maybe your brown hair. Or whatever thing you hate that you can\u2019t change.  That\u2019s what that is saying. \nAlong with saying born this way. Not sure if you realize, the whole popularity of the saying came from Lady Gaga.  In fact it\u2019s whole meaning is the complete opposite of what your implying it means.  It literally mean, you were born the way you are and you can\u2019t change it. Or it\u2019s the way God made you. Not sure how it implies you believe it means it\u2019s a choice, when it\u2019s whole thing is saying its not a choice. It\u2019s like when people saying addict have a choice, when in reality, they really don\u2019t, it is in their genetics. Some people are more like to developers addiction compared to others. It\u2019s also why it seems like addiction is always within families.", "Thank you, this is what I am trying to say", "It's probably just a difference of interpretations. OP doesn't really phrase things too well resulting in these discrepancies in our interpretations. I was raised a Christian, but I don't follow it closely anymore."]}
