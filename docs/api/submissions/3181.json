I am a 39 year old mother to three. In 2020 I lost my mother to COVID and at that point my father became more miserable than he already was. The decision was made that my husband, our kids and I would move in with my father. Even before mom was sick he was needing more and more help on the farm. So for the past year I\u2019ve been full time taking care of my father and my kids and running the family business. My husband has been helping me at least with the farm side of things, but if I need a break from everything else he complains he\u2019s been working all week and he wants to go fishing or do anything but help me raise our kids and keep our home clean.\n\nIt\u2019s all been too much for me to do alone. My older brother somewhat recently retired from the USMC after over twenty years and I had been talking him into coming home to help out, because I do understand that there\u2019s a lot of work falling on my husband. Now there\u2019s a lot of family history but my brother and father left off on bad terms and he hasn\u2019t been home since he was a teen. But I convinced him and he came back, and brought his husband, about two months ago. Only now he\u2019s looking to leave again. Our father wasn\u2019t very welcoming but we expected that and otherwise everything was going alright until it wasn\u2019t.\n\nWhatever happened it was about a week ago, and all my brother he told me was if he ain\u2019t wanted he had nothing keeping him here. So I come to find out from my husband that he had told my brother to back off and that we don\u2019t need the help of some gays, except when he said it to me he used the f word. Now I'm not saying my husband is a saint and I knew his thoughts on homosexuals but I never once thought he would act like that towards anyone, much less my own brother. And we absolutely need all the help we can get right now. I convinced my brother to try staying longer, and I told my husband and my father they need to get their shit together and until they start trying I\u2019m not doing anything around the house any longer, only the absolute bare minimum for my father\u2019s health needs.\n\nI don\u2019t think they believed me at all and now my husband is all pissed that I didn\u2019t make a God damned thing for thanksgiving. I haven\u2019t even gotten any groceries. My kids are mostly old enough to fend for themselves, the oldest is 16 and the youngest is 9, though I did make sure there was at least some food around that the kids can make. And of course my husband is a grown man and can cook dinner for his family, but instead he chose to disappear off somewhere in a rage. It\u2019s not even been that long and I\u2019m wondering now what I\u2019m even doing and if I should be the one to cave in, if I\u2019m the one being more of the asshole.

We both told our kids they will always be loved by us and should never feel afraid to be themselves after learning what a hard time my brother had with it. I knew my husband didn't understand but I never would have thought him to be that kind of man. And my brother is an adult so I don't appreciate the assumption that I lured him. I'm not saying it's a great situation but I am saying he did understand going in that our father at least wasn't all too pleased with him showing up, their relationship is complicated.

A lot of people who have racist/homophobic leaning thoughts keep the opinions but don\u2019t act on them because of social norms, keeping the peace and just basic human decency. Just like how we all probably have a family member we don\u2019t really like but don\u2019t say anything and just put up with. Only if we really really can\u2019t stand them then we voice up and act on it.

He expected him to take on the family business and he feels abandoned and claims even God has forsaken him by taking his good son and leaving him with nothing but trouble. They seemed to be mending their relationship a bit at one point but that progress ended when he told the family about his lifestyle and my father just said he should have been the son to die. I know it's not right but my brother is a grown man and he did know a bit what he was getting himself into, though again I didn't know how bad my husband was about it but my brother knew my husband thinks it's a choice he made. I'm not trying to make excuses but I feel like I'm being made out to seem like I sugar coated it and lied to him to get him to come home. He knew what this place is like, but I'm not gonna blame him if he ends up leaving since I do understand it's hostile.", "My kids do a fairly good job with their chores, the youngest we joke is a bit of a hurricane but I think his ADHD makes it hard for him. I worry about my oldest daughter, especially over the last couple of years she has started acting like a mom to the younger two and I don't want to be doing that to her. I never have to tell her twice to do something and she's usually up before dawn out in the barn taking care of the horse chores out there. She's so serious all the time and I want her to be my little baby for just a bit longer. \n\nI told him he needs to apologize for saying that and he was saying it's just a fact what he said. But I know he has to know how mean it was of him to say that, and based on what we'd discussed before I thought we both believed it's not our place to judge and we're not above judgment ourselves. I thought I knew him to be a better man than that. And even after he said it my brother is still around helping keep everything together for now and I think my husband is embarrassed to see that after the way he acted to him my brother is still stepping up. He's too proud to admit when he needs help and I'm worried about him wherever he is right now.\n\nI'm sorry about you mom, I miss mine everyday and I have no idea how she mostly held this family all together.

According to things like [third](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/21/opinion/sunday/bible-prohibit-gay-sex.html) that I've read, the original Biblical texts weren't against homosexuality. Or at least not so vehemently against it as is taught by too many churches today. \n\nPeople always say, \"The Bible says it's a sin! If you approve of them,  you'll go to hell with them!\" The Bible says not to judge, that you'll be judged by the scale you use to judge others, and to be kind. It also says wearing mixed fabrics is a sin, but they're happy to keep rocking that polyblend. It's something some parts of society has chosen to hate. But imo nothing excuses verbally abusing someone, and that's what your husband did to your brother. \n\nGood luck with all that.

It's something he'd said before knowing that too though so it's not only about his sexuality. And sorry for saying lifestyle I know that's not the proper thing to say I didn't mean it to come across rude.", "Oh I agree with that so much. I have tried for years to convince my father that it's people's hatred which has caused them to use the Bible to perpetuate that hate. Jesus welcomed prostitutes and lepers after all. It's not my job to decide who is right or wrong, I am here to put love into the world and that's all I wish to do.
