They are absolutely the person I want to spend all my time with, and I thoroughly enjoy making them happy as I can. We've been together for more than a few years now. Let's call them a super non-binary name like Chris, just in case they find this. We're Nth generation Americans, so nothing below is cultural that I can tell. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nChris has some eating habits that they're unwilling to change, and I just cannot have a meal with them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- **They eat with their hands**. We're not talking about fries and pizza, we're talking about picking out the sliced olives from their salad. If I grill some veggies, then they'll ignore the utensils altogether, and eat with their fingers. It's not a huge deal, but happens enough that it makes me feel a little uncomfortable. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \n\\- **Open mouth chewing**. This is the killer for me. Chewing with their mouth open and then licking or smacking their lips. It's not a quiet chewing either, as it's a bite of a burger for example, and then chewing without closing their lips. After a bite, it's a half tongue out to lick their lips. It'd be one thing if I could just read a book or check my phone while we're eating but the killer is always the sounds! I can hear the *SMACK SMACK SMACK* while eating. Did I mention the soup slurping? There's soup slurping too. All the noises while eating.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor a few months now, I've been avoiding meals at home together (mostly dinners), where I'll make them a meal, and then just say I'm not feeling well or hungry. They began to notice that I had an appetite when eating out at restaurants or with company, but seemed to be avoiding the issue at home. So I explained the issues, and they seemed super oblivious about it. So I asked if I could point out when they were doing it, in case it was thoroughly subconscious. We tried that for a bit, but they quickly became frustrated with my \"constant corrections.\"   \n\n\nI've given up at this point, and have considered this to just be something we agree to disagree about.   \n\n\nI absolutely love every other interaction we have, and everything else in this relationship aligns exceedingly well.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n*AITA for just avoiding meals with them when we're alone?* They expressed how they're feeling hurt when I avoid meals, or point out the noises, but they're also unwilling to work on the uncomfortable (for me) sound effects. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen we're eating with others, then I'll stick around but usually ensure that I'm back in the kitchen to \"finish up\" or clean etc. while they eat so I enjoy more of my meal without the barbaric sounds (I kid, but seriously...)

You're NTA\n\nIf he's unwilling to work on smacking their lips or chewing with their mouth open, then I think you have every right to be upset about it and do what you can to save your sanity. You not eating meals with your partner because they wont work on fixing a rather gross  habit is just the consequences of his actions.", "I\u2019m sorry, how did your partner get past adolescence being unaware that their table manners are sorely lacking? How did your partner ever get past the first dinner date with you? Have they ever had a businesses meal? How can you go out to eat in public or with  other people without your dinner companions  raising their eyebrows? And his parents? Where were they in their table manners training? Was he raised by wolves? \n\nIt\u2019s all very well to behave like in the comfort of one\u2019s home home\u2026 (sort of), but, damn, *to be unaware that it is even a problem!* is beyond the fucking pale. NTA\n\nedit to add-my husband said to take a video of them eating so they can see and hear the disgusting noises.", "NTA Look up misophonia.\n\nAlso, was your partner raised in a barn? Open mouth chewing is gross; no one wants to see your food while you\u2019re eating it. Does your partner eat like this around other people or just at home? Like is this an adult who is eating salad with fingers at a restaurant or someone else\u2019s house?", "NTA. The level of rage that eating noise can trigger is quite disconcerting and I completely understand why you want to avoid it. But since your partner completely refuses to even try, you have to exist in the situation as best you can, if you don\u2019t want to leave them. But don\u2019t tiptoe around it, be honest. I\u2019d be surprised if bad table manners hasn\u2019t had other negative social ramifications in their life. If you are very straightforward about why you\u2019re refusing to eat with them, maybe they\u2019ll finally get why no one invites them to client dinners (or the like).", "NTA. My feeling is that if the way you eat bothers your partner, and they tell you, then you should try very hard to correct your eating habits. Eating with the mouth open is widely acknowledged to be rude, so your partner has no leg to stand on there. Many people find loud eating bothersome, and your partner should want to make mealtimes more pleasant for you. I have to say I'm left with quite a negative impression of Chris that they took your reminders so poorly.", "NTA\n\nThe hands thing, whatever. But chewing with your mouth closed when other people are around is like baseline human social behaviour. Eating noises are simply intolerable. \n\nI feel you\u2019ve done everything you can and they are refusing to accept any solution except, I guess, you just dealing with it (again, intolerable.) All you\u2019re left with is just to walk away from the offensive sounds.", "NTA\n\nFrankly, this would be a relationship deal breaker\n\nYou've told them how it affects you and your concerns, and they are either oblivious or don't give a shit", "NTA the mouth smacking would be a relationship ended for me you have the patience of a saint", "NTA, but like\u2026 what\u2019s your long term plan here? Just doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s a viable option to just not eat together when it sounds very much possible, seeings as they\u2019ve noticed also.", "NTA. That's just gross", "NTA sounds like they\u2019re immature and pretty gross, tbh. Maybe buy them a Miss Manners book, since they\u2019re really not getting the hint that their mealtime behavior is disgusting.", "NTA on the general issue, but you're at an impasse here now that all the cards are on the table. Love doesn't conquer all.\n\nYou're willing to eat alone, but he doesn't accept that option (fair enough, sharing meals is really important to most people). He asked for feedback/correction and you tried complying, but he wasn't receptive (unreasonable of him).", "I had a boyfriend in uni that I loved. We aligned on everything, we adored each other's families, he was kind and good and gentle and sweet...and sitting across from him while he ate cereal was like staring into an open cement mixer and also listening to one. It was an open secret in our friend group that sitting across from him in the cafeteria was to be avoided at all costs.\n\nOne morning we were eating lunch in his room and I was gazing at him in adoration because he'd decorated the table with a little flower, and then he started masticating a meatball sub, and a little voice in my head said \"do you have what it takes to stare at this for every meal for the next fifty years?\"\n\nThe answer to that was no. Absolutely not. I tried so hard to get over it, because he was so wonderful, but after six months of trying to get him to close his mouth, I couldn't keep going. All sexual attraction vanished, dates had to be strictly food-free, not even popcorn at a movie...it just wasn't sustainable.\n\nTrust me, something like this is like sandpaper on your relationship. It might wear you down slower than a bigger flaw would, but you're still gonna be worn down eventually. And the fact that your guy is pushing back instead of being horrified that he's gross? Maybe not a red flag but it's dark pink. My ex at least felt badly, just...not badly enough to close his mouth to chew.", "NTA I have misophonia, and just reading that made me cringe.  I think you need to just be honest and say \"I love you, but I can't with the eating noises\"", "I personally don't see the problem with the eating veggie with your hands, whether that be picking something out of a salad or cooked veggies, but I also know I'm on the outs of polite society on that front.\n\nThe smacking lips thing is actually disrespectful. My sister has misophonia and the majority of the family is respectful enough to attempt at the very least to eat only while she's eating and apologize if we start smacking our lips unconsciously. Some meals are more avoidable than others. Regardless, people who love each other would be willing to make an attempt if nothing else.\n\nI believe that you love your partner. It should be a dark orange/pink flag that your partner doesn't care about your discomfort. NTA", "NTA in this case.", "NTA. Tell them to eat with some common courtesy it\u2019s not that difficult.", "Nope, NTA. You expressed your honest opinions and their not willing to even attempt to work on the issues that bother you. Agree to disagree is the best option I think you have here as well as avoiding having meals together", "NTA I would absolutely not eat with anyone eating with their mouth open. It's a bad habit that they need to get out of.   \n\n\nWhat's more, maybe you have misophonia?", "NTA I swear my dad has gotten worse and worse table manners with age. He literally will moan and grunt when he eats. So beyond uncomfortable and I do call him out! And he doesn\u2019t stop it!! And even worse, he laughs at others for bad table manners such as using a knife incorrectly or reaching over someone to grab something, which really aren\u2019t that bad in the grand scheme of things", "That's just really gross. I have misophonia and that would make me rage. NTA", "NTA. You're valid for wanting to enjoy your meals without seeing/hearing/experiencing someone's every chew. That sounds disgusting tbh. Has nobody else ever called Chris out on it? Do any of your friends seemed bothered by it?\n\nHere's the thing.....this is not sustainable in any way. Are you going to spend 10, 20, 30 years running for the kitchen every time your SO starts to eat? \n\nI'm bothered that Chris doesn't seem to be making a genuine effort. Chris is probably used to enjoying meals the way they want to enjoy them, but you're going out of your way to accomodate their eating habits even though it's inconvenient to you. Chris should be making equal effort to quiet down, at least sometimes, to accomodate your aversion to these noises.", "NTA you probably have misophonia and the should learn to not eat like a monster.", "NTA. I wouldn't eat with your husband, either. He's an adult, he should act like one at the dinner table.", "NTA\n\nI assume your so has no interest in learning table manners.\n\nOnly you can decide if you want to stay with someone who is an embarrassment to be around when they're eating.\n\nHugs and Good Luck", "NTA sign up for an etiquette dinner class for the both of you. Maybe if someone else is correcting their behavior it will make a bigger impact.", "Yeah, NTA. I get it after a while it\u2019s just way too much and ridiculous grossness to eat like that and refuse to change \n\nI would set up some cameras and record how they look and sound - they need to see it to believe it", "[deleted]", "NTA I like heard that in my mind and I am angry at the sounds lol. Its not an american culture thing at all, and according to american culture that is rude. You chew with your mouth closed, some people go as far as to try to be as quiet as possible when chewing.\nThe grabbing things with hands is a bit strange but eh. Tho from this whole thing I can only imagine like a kid doing all this.", "Not even just the loud chewing, the *eating with their hands* that's enough for me to wanna yarf. Sounds like you tried and they're unwilling to change, big 'ole NTA from me. \n\nI wouldn't want to deal with that either, but I think there must be a reason *why* they're eating like this. Maybe some time for them to go to therapy? Sensory things? Unleashing goblin mode? Idk.", "NTA. I could not eat around this behavior either. I would lose my appetite.", "NTA and eating with your SO sounds atrocious. I don't know if I could even continue the relationship if all they do is get mad about \"constant corrections\" rather than being concerned that their etiquette is grossing you out that badly.", "You can't live like this for the rest of your life. Something has got to give. Do they do this when you're out as well? These are pretty basic manners. Eating a few things with your fingers is pretty normal but eating with your mouth open is gross, and not using utensils at all is obviously something unexpected, unless as you say there's a cultural element which you've said there isn't. A serious conversation needs to be had, because you can't avoid this for the rest of your life.", "I don\u2019t blame you I would not eat with them either. I find it just disgusting.", "If this always bothered you, then why did you get together? If it\u2019s new or growing irritation, then it could be your subconscious falling out of love.", "Nah you're misophonia or his eating.", "**YTA**, slightly. Some of what you mentioned is valid, some not so much. This is a bigger issue than manners though. You and your partner will come across traits and habits that rub the other one the wrong way. The key thing will be how do you communicate and overcome this -- most likely through compromise on what each of you think is reasonable.", "NAH. I don't think your partner is a bad person for having eating habits that gross you out, and I get why they feel hurt. I don't think you're a bad person for being grossed out by it, either. It sounds like you're just not compatible eating partners. If you can spend lots of time with your partner otherwise\u2014and you may want to reassure them that you _do_ generally love spending time with them\u2014I think it's fair to say, \"I love you and I love being with you and I wouldn't change anything about you\u2014and because of all those things, I just can't eat with you anymore. Let me show my love in other ways.\"", "Very light YTA. The hands thing you need to let go of; it's fine.\n\nThe smacking and mouth-open eating I get but what are you going to do.  Never eat at home with them for the rest of your entire life together? Find a compromise.", "YTA - I get you think the way that they eats is gross, but not eating with someone you love for something as shallow as not using cutlery and eating with their mouth open is just selfish and won't work out in the long term", "[deleted]", "YTA\n\nYou're both at home, as long as their hands are washed they can use them to eat soup if they so want to\n\nChewing with mouth open? They're at home, comfortable, with their partner with whom they should absolutely feel comfortable to chew, fart, burp, and all of the other normal body things.\n\nIt's healthier to eat with your mouth open, and tastier to slurp the coffee.\n\nAnd then you keep \"correcting\" them?\n\nAnd avoid spending time with them as a punishment for not being \"corrected\"\n\nYou sound exhausting and rather toxic, your poor partner can't be themselves around you or feel comfortable enough to eat as they please. Not sure what your problem is op.\n\nHuge asshole", "YTA lightly. I think the eating with hands is something you shouldn\u2019t fuss about, they\u2019re at least not dirtying up more utensils. But the mouth smacking.. honestly I get it. My husband does the same thing. But I will still try to eat meals with him from time to time, or I will make sure we\u2019re eating while watching TV or listening to music to drown out the noise or at least make it less noticeable. I think you gotta bite the bullet and eat with them sometimes to make sure they don\u2019t feel ignored and try to come up with coping strategies.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I even agreed that the behaviour is still an issue so I don't know why I'm being downvoted. \nPartner needs to stop being a pig.", "What\u2019s big and small depends on the other person, too. \n\nLike if I were with someone who swore a lot, I don\u2019t care about that at all. \n\nI\u2019m not doing someone\u2019s laundry, 100%. But I\u2019ve been pestering my partner to be better with changing the TP roll and wiping off the coffee machine after use for most of our relationship. He still doesn\u2019t. Used to bug me, but over time I stopped caring. He does plenty of other stuff and hey, I\u2019ve got blind spots too. \n\nThe gross mouth noises, also a no from me. But eating separately is fine. \n\nMaking excuses is one thing but sometimes you just really don\u2019t care that much about something. Humans are deeply flawed, imo compatibility is as much about whether or not you can handle each other\u2019s flaws and blind spots as it is about the good stuff. \n\nWhich of course isn\u2019t to say \u201ctolerate everything.\u201d  But OP is free to decide what they think they\u2019re willing to accept on balance and what they aren\u2019t. Everyone is and everyone does, or they end up alone or in a miserable relationship with someone who does the laundry and doesn\u2019t swear.", "Exactly. Bad is subjective..which is why your advice is garbage. You aren't considering that fact. Stop fishing for negative karma.", "You've ignored the point again. This conflict is not about \"not swearing\" or \"not doing laundry\" in general. These are examples. It's not even really about the person chewing with their mouth open. \n\nIt's about knowing when swearing is inappropriate, and avoiding it at those times. It's not even about having shitty manners and chewing with your mouth open; it's about not having the most basic decency to behave in a way that is not repulsively offensive to basically all of society, and most importantly their actual partner, OP.\n\nThis behavior is trash, and if the partner can't be bothered to not be shitty, the partner is trash too. OP can do better than someone who chews like a barnyard animal. This is NOT too much to ask."]}
