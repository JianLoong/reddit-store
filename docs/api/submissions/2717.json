She wants her cake and eat it too.", "My mom was video chatting with him and he was saying something about stop moving the phone, he liked the camera on her breasts, and my mom zoomed in. My wife and two other people were in the room. To my mom/my family that is so mild it wouldn't even be leave the room territory. My wife was raised totally different.\n\nFor the show my mom agreed they shouldn't be watching it but said it was our responsibility to take them and leave the room, and she would not be told what to do in her house and on a trip she was paying for.\n\nThere are times she has been rude, mostly just because she wants what she wants and is used to getting it. there are times my wife has been rude to her, but the relationship is so bad at this point they read into every little thing such as chewing lips", "my wife isn't ok with the money and paid time off that would require. She also wouldn't be ok with us staying with her as we don't know her husband at all and she worries about our kids and strange men", "There's literally no sign that he's a Mama's boy. In fact quite the opposite he's taken his wife's side the vast majority of time.", "He said wife said was too expensive.", "Seriously, the wife doesn\u2019t seem like she would really let the mom see them. All meals eaten out (because she\u2019s not allowed in the sanctuary), all meet up\u2019s being outings\u2026double expensive and not really quality time", "The post has nothing in it to indicate that the wife doesn't want her kids to have a relationship with MIL, just that _she_ doesn't and _she_ doesn't want to be the one to travel.\n\nIf you read the post properly, you'd see that the wife made a dig that the kids don't recognise her because she doesn't visit.\n\nOP needs to grow up and take his kids to see MIL and stop expecting his wife to play host or interact with her", "And how long was that visit?", "Idk man, kinda sounds weird. Someone who pays for trips then uses it and holds it over your head.....kinda narcissist move. Still feel like it's gard to say. Sounds like they both could work on it but some of the deets on your mom make her sound like the bad guy", "Yeah we're getting into JNMIL territory here.", "Dude, you\u2019re too far gone to even talk to. Go to therapy. Seriously. I don\u2019t mean that in a snarky way. You\u2019re brainwashed. Not everything is only about your wife. What you are OK with matters too.", "Oh no I read the post. I\u2019m sure the wife is completely fine with her children having a relationship with MIL, but on her terms. Meaning MIL coming to her. I highly doubt she would be ok with OP taking the kids by himself or going alone, or maybe he would have done it already.", "OP said that his wife decided its to expensive to go visit his mom, so it sounds like that's out too unless standing up to her in any way I'd something he's willing to do", "As an adult she has the obligation to at LEAST act civil in front of MIL for the kids sake. Don\u2019t place all the blame on OP and his mum, for all we know maybe it\u2019s his wife that\u2019s actually the problem here, stop being rash when there\u2019s not enough info.", "Considering a few days ago there was a post in which a husband was trying to guilt his wife into having a relationship with his mother after Sher repeatedly kicked her in the pregnant stomach, I'm going to go ahead and guess that there IS a reason why she doesn't want MIL in her hous and OP left it out to make his wife look worse.", "NTA. This post has nothing to do with what you read a few days ago in another completely different post."]}
