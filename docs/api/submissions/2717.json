Thats a cross she is willing to die on. My father in law lives an HOUR away and hasn't visited in FOUR YEARS because I told him I need 2 days notice for an extended visit to my home. Im autistic and ADHD and my home is my sanctuary. His parents are obtuse and rude and filthy. There is not an ice cubes chance in HELL they would be allowed to stay in my home so I could feel unsafe and shitty 25 hours a day. \n\nYou suck for not calling out your mom. \nYour mom sucks for not just accepting what might not be a normal boundary to her but PREVENTS HER FROM KNOWING HER GRANDCHILDREN.  \nYour wife sucks for digging in and not leaving it , you should be taking the kids to your mom.

Sometimes kids visit grandma. It's a relationship, not a dictatorship.", "NTA. Wife is toxic and a bully.", "Why does mom.have to come? Why don't you take the kids to see HER? And your wife can go have a vacation of her own.", "NTA\n\nYour wife seems insufferable. There might be people on here that think the spouse is always right, but I prefer to look at facts when everyone is family.

Your mother had sex scenes playing with kids in the room during a visit when you and your children were the guests. The host is supposed to make the guests feel comfortable.

Have facetimes about your boobs in your bedroom when you have guests over. There is a big difference between not making accommodations for the children and pulling crap like that. Your version of what is ok behavior and everyone else's ideas of what is ok behavior is different. I wouldn't want to hear a facetime involving discussion about my mother-in-law's sexy boobs either. I guarantee if your mother did visit she would be the guest and everything should go her way, not accommodating the family with children. \n\nIt's shameful that you think it's ok for your mother to treat your family like this, and your wife is your family by the way. Just because you grew up with that behavior being excused and normalized doesn't mean it's ok. Read your comments back to yourself as someone outside of the situation, or read them to a friend (not anyone on your mother's side like a brother-in-law or cousin, etc) and see what they would say.

I am quite *literally* this way too, but when my inlaws, etc., were all alive, I made extra efforts to visit THEM, to take THEM out to eat, to make trips to see THEM so that they would not feel like I was dodging the plague.  I did that so that something exactly like this would not happen. \n\nYour wife is an entitled AH. Sorry, and you've allowed her to rule this roost this way, for how many years? *She needs some knocking down off her perch.* What, is your mom her slave? Her subordinate? She's your mom's boss?

No. That's expensive. Plane trips alone can cost anywhere from 200-1000 depending on the destinations and baggage fees etc plus hotels for one to two nights can also run up in the hundreds. I understand her and your mom not getting along but this is something she needs to just let happen once in awhile (as I'm sure trips like this can't happen often cause again it gets expensive) and just put up with her mil for a night or two.

Its your home too, thats your Mom she can suck up a visit for you and the children's sake or go stay somewhere else. If its important to you it should be important to her. Look my mil is a lovely lady in some aspects but in others she really falls short of the mark. However thats my husband's mom his relationship has nothing to do with my personal opinions about her and I would love for her to be interested in my children.

I\u2019d be flying twice a year minimally and staying at a nearby hotel ready and waiting to visit the hours SIL will allow, but I also have the means to do that. I\u2019m not saying that is reasonable, but I also know my parents and in laws would do the exact same- but I\u2019m speaking from a place of privilege and healthy relationships.

So your wife feels judged and is being judged by your mother who is used to getting her own way. You are trying to keep the peace by downplaying what your mother is doing, which is likely making your wife feel alone and like you think she is crazy. I get that you want peace, but your downplaying is now hurting your relationship. Your wife is not handling things gracefully. Your mother is definitely not handling things gracefully either. Only solution I can figure is to both travel somewhere to meet up. Somewhere where you don't spend as much money as your mother does to get there and where you both have separate base camps so your wife can escape your mother's criticisms. Or ... your mother sucks it up and stays in a nearby B&B. Or ... your wife gets to stay in a nearby B&B while your mom visits. Because if you override your wife here, she's getting the message that you think what your mom did was okay. That you love your mom more than you love her. That might be a dealbreaker when things come to a head during the visit. You could legit end up divorced.\n\nEdit 2: Plus the boob thing ... yeah. I wouldn't want to feel trapped by that too. I don't know how old your kids are, but do you want your kids to witness sexualization of their mother or any other woman? Do you want that normalized for them? The sex scene movie thing is odd too. What your wife heard from your mom is that when the kids are visiting her territory, your mother won't change what she wants to do, even if what she wants to do is not good for the kids. So she wants the kids to have supervised visits with your mom on territory that doesn't belong to your mom. \n\nHowever, having your mom visit and stay in the house doesn't address the trapped feeling your wife feels. Maybe your wife thinks you override how it feels to be trapped in a place where you receive criticism and objectification. In my personal experience, being trapped in my apartment elevator with someone creeping on me was much more damaging to my sense of self than someone creeping on me when I could easily get away from the creep. \n\nYou both need to go to counselling for how poorly you communicate and how poorly you listen to each other. Truthfully, this is a much bigger issue than your initial post let on and what you didn't explain in the original post makes me suspicious about what else you've kept hidden to rack up more N T A votes. Either you are avoiding seeing this from your wife's POV or you are more like your mom than you think in that you will override others to get what you want, which is peace from an escalating conflict that won't be dealt with by ignoring it and communicating around each other.

This is the/a MIL troll.", "I wouldn\u2019t say I feel entitled to my moms home but I would not visit her and stay in a hotel. If she didn\u2019t actually want me to stay with her I\u2019d feel weird about the visit and not want to go", "She has to pay for a round trip plane ticket, presumably pay to rent a car, AND get a hotel room for about a week. She might as well go visit Disney World instead, it would cost the same and she wouldn't have to do all that traveling just to see her son and grandkids for a couple hours each day", "Same! We offer the guest room because it\u2019s in the finished basement with its own living area and bathroom but they prefer their own hotel so they can have their own time as well. His wife isn\u2019t an asshole to suggest this\u2026.", "Then I hope I'm wrong in wondering if that rule only applies to your mother and how other compromises are brokered for your household, but leaning hard NTA and like this is the Iranian yogurt of your life.", "Just because she doesn\u2019t ask for you to change the rule doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not trying to manipulate you to change the rule for her.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t want to pay for a hotel room for two weeks, that\u2019s on her. She can make the trip shorter. She is blaming your rule for the reason she won\u2019t come and see you.\n\nYour mom is a grown woman and can figure it out for herself.\n\nYou wife is right if your mom wanted to see her grandchildren she would move heaven and earth to do that. But to your mother it\u2019s not about that, it\u2019s about her getting her way. Your wife has a right to her sanity.", "I mean they don't have free reign. The do weekly visits, which is consistent with wife's demand for designated visiting time, and they never stay over. OP clarified that no one ever stays over at their house so it seems like she applies the same rules to everyone.", "YCITA", "She just laughed, didn't call her a bitch", "I think that\u2019s the real problem. Doesn\u2019t it bother you that your mother doesn\u2019t give a crap about being a part of your kids\u2019 lives? Why would staying in a hotel be more uncomfortable than staying in your home with your wife when they both hate each other?", "Doesn't seem like OP's wife is cool with OP doing things with the kids without her. The whole \"the home is a sanctuary\" thing is a red herring, OP's wife doesn't want to spend time with MIL regardless of where it occurs.", "yes it bothers me but I do understand it", "And people complain about everything their MIL does. It\u2019s sad sometimes. \n\nI see posts (not part of that sub because it\u2019s weird) in parenting groups where the MIL was genuinely trying to be kind and/or helpful, but it wasn\u2019t *exactly* what the DIL wanted/expected", "Exactly.\n\nOP should demand they both pick their one 2nd best.\n\nSorry mom, let's find reasonable lodging bc 2 weeks is just not ok at OPs home.\n\nWife - if mom meets us there you: 1) agree to not pick fights or bicker in any way & let OP drive the bus when contentions arise. 2) Set visting time at more than you'd prefer bc MIL is meeting in the middle by staying at hotel/motel/airbnb.", "Have you ever thought of just going on a family vacation? You stay out of each other's homes so your wife keeps her solitude. Go somewhere kid friendly, you can do family stuff together or apart, meet up for a meals, different rooms, order your own food and maybe grandma can babysit for an evening or two and you can have date night with your wife. Everyone wins.", "FINALLY! I was scrolling to see this. Thank you for speaking the truth!", "Looks like it. These are pretty repetitive. My new theory on this is that this the writer IS the mother/MIL, since the most repetitive aspect is being wealthy (as in this episode), along with being hotter than the daughter in law, having an attractive partner who loves to tell off the son/DIL, etc, etc\u2026", "Your wife is a bit nuts.", "God forbid the kids themselves", "A sanctuary is like a bedroom or a she shed or something....you can not declare and entire communal living space as a personal sanctuary.   \n\n\nWhat happens when the kids get older and piss her off? Get out, you're ruining my sanctuary? No....you should separate to your bedrooms to cool off, come back and discuss the issue when you aren't worked up anymore.", "I agree, I\u2019m surprised so many people are coming down so heavily on the wife and not the mum", "It\u2019s all about control. Wife sounds like a narcissist to be honest.", "I mean, you couldn't pay me to let my mother in law stay in my house overnight ... Luckily my husband is on the same page.", "Are you the wife? Because you sound like an apologetic narcissist. Yikes \ud83d\udc40\ud83d\ude02", "Your wife is very entitled and she feels comfortable bullying your mom because you allow this.", "I can see why his mom has a problem with his wife... she's a B.", "Yeah he absolutely does NOT owe his wife an apology. Are you kidding? She interrupted a phone call with his mother to taunt and insult her and his mother responded with more grace than that witch deserved. If you think how this woman is acting is okay, that\u2019s concerning.", "If you think OP's wife would allow anything like that based on the tidbit of info we have, I really need you to pass that burning item in your hand this way. Seems nearly certain shed find a way to sabotage an attempt like that.", "Thank you, I'm so glad I'm not alone in seeing the abuse here. She's distanced him from his family and now she's using their children as a weapon in her abuse.\n\nu/Regular-Engineer-820\n\nPlease see this and know that you're not alone, you are stronger than you know and you are worth more than the way you're being treated by this woman.", "the wife refuses to let them go because it\u2019s too expensive. She sounds exhausting, if you think that relationship is so important you can suck it up for a few days.", "It's his home too. Why should the home be all about her?", "Yet she made no effort to get to know him?", "Stand up to your wife. If you stay with your kids the whole time then they won't be alone with \"a strange man\"", "Someone recently asked marriage counselors what the biggest red flags were to look for and this was one of them. A spouse that tries to put you against friends or family.", "It is a sanctuary though. Her sanctuary and she allows OP to live there. Guarantee he isn't allowed certain people over without prior approval", "My mom believes if you have young kids you need to remove them and you don\u2019t get to ruin things for everyone else. It wasn\u2019t that she wanted them to watch it, just that she thought my wife was being entitled", "I\u2019m honestly wondering if there\u2019s a past trauma that MIL & SFIL are (unknowingly, unconsciously) triggering. All the wife\u2019s reactions and excuses are not proportional to the situation at hand, and are actually conflicting with her own parents\u2019 visiting conditions. Something here is not totally right. \n\n\n\nI agree this is a wife issue. OP needs to start considering what does *he* need to have a \u201csanctuary\u201d of his own at *his own home*, including the conditions of his mum\u2019s visiting (if they want to have granny in their lives).", "Yeah why not just have a week where you guys fly out to visit her? You and the kids can stay with your mom while she stays in a hotel. I know that sounds rude but if she can't be bothered to care she should get a taste of what her own medicine would feel like while you and your children enjoy nice family time"]}
