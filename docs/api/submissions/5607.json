She has a skin condition and is an ex stray, so her tail looks a bit raggedy, but she's tough as an old boot and looks after herself. \nA few weeks ago, a woman found her and took her to the vet saying she was \"on the brink of death\". The vet is familiar with our cat and assured her she was fine, and called us to pick her up. The vet apparently had to force the woman to leave our cat behind, as she kept insisting she had to take her home. Luckily our cat is microchipped. Since then, this woman has been posting in our local residents fb group and somehow got our address off one of the neighbours. \nShe shows up at our house, sometimes multiple times a day, with our cat.

She doesn't seem to grasp that if she stops paying the cat attention  she will leave her alone.\nShe's quite young, I'd say 19 ish, and seems very sweet  even going so far as to buy the cat a \"nicer\" collar than the one she already had and regularly pays for her own cabs to our house. The issue is, she shows up EVERY. DAY. It's completely unnecessary and no matter what we say, she isn't getting the hint. She showed up twice today alone and it's CHRISTMAS DAY. We were in the middle of dinner and she wouldn't shut up about how the cat was outside in the rain, as if cats aren't fucking waterproof.

She obviously has good intentions but maybe thinks all cats should be indoor cats or something? She seems overly worried about the cat even after a vet told her the cat was doing well. And even though she means well, I'm guessing it's ANNOYING lol. I'd be annoyed.\n\nYou've tried being kind and tactful and it doesn't seem to be working. I think you need to be firm. Something along the lines of\n\n\"look, I know you mean well, but you've been told by myself and my vet that our cat is fine. She's an outdoor cat who can come and go as she pleases, therefore if it's raining / cold or whatever and she's\" sad\", she can come home. She knows perfectly well where she lives. She absolutely doesn't need your help to get home and I'd have thought that would be obvious to you by now. Your constant interruptions are becoming extremely intrusive and I've been patient with you so far but turning up on Xmas day was a step too far. You're no longer welcome at my home.\nIf you stop feeding /interacting with my cat she'll stop turning up at your home. If you want to keep interacting with her that is fine, just don't bring her home, she'll come back herself. \"\n\nI'd say that's just perfect. Not too nasty but also truthful. She needs to know that her behaviour is wrong or she'll never learn. She clearly has problems understanding what's acceptable in society. Good luck op.", "Wait\u2026. Cats are waterproof?", "NTA\n\nShe refuses to accept the fact your cat is fine and stalked you. Definitely not TA", "Nta but be careful. I get the feeling if you ask her to stop coming she\u2019ll just take your cat. I\u2019d make sure you have her address", "NTA the woman seems a bit stalkerish. She might think she has good intentions but she's over stepping. At this point I would be seriously concerned that she will steal your cat. If possible you may want to keep you cat inside for awhile. Pet theft is fairly common and in most places the police can't or won't do anything about it.", "NTA If you were to tell her clearly that she is not welcome to keep coming by.\n\nHonestly, it sounds like she\u2019s not all there - she may be neurodivergent, mentally ill or have a learning need, all of which could explain the special interest in the cat and lack of respect of social norms. It seems like she thinks she\u2019s doing the right thing, has developed a bond with the cat and with you.\n\nYou need to very firmly and clearly tell her the cat is fine, she needs to leave it alone and stop coming to your house. You also need to stop giving her opportunities to develop that bond - you mentioned she stops to talk for a long time, but you have the power to take your cat and walk away/close the door. Don\u2019t give her any reason to feel welcome.\n\nI don\u2019t want to start another debate in the comments of your post about indoor/outdoor cats, but would suggest if you can keep the cat inside for a few days this might help break the cycle. It sounds like she may have learned its regular haunts around town, and if she doesn\u2019t see it for a while she may move on to other interests (possibly also not, but it could be worth a try).\n\nAfter setting a firm boundary, if she continues to interact with your cat and visit your home, your next steps could include contacting the police or asking the local cab company to ban her from rides to your home.", "NTA.  This woman sounds mentally or emotionally disturbed.

However - did you consider buying the cat a collar to show that it is has an owner? I'm not sure why you'd leave the cat without a collar when people cannot see visually that it's microchipped. I don't blame them for thinking it's a stray upon first look but her actions since then are ridiculous", "NTA my grandma took in a big ol' stray boy and there's no way he'd let you keep him inside so I understand in this case", "NTA. honestly, as bad as it sounds, id say stop letting your cat out for a bit. you need to stand your ground, but there\u2019s a chance if you do so she\u2019ll try to steal your cat. she sounds unhealthy.", "NTA, but don't use the collar, don't entertain this, and if she's shows up again, I'd explain you've been nice so far, but this is now harassment and she needs to leave.", "\u201cYou\u2019ve ventured into stalking behavior and it\u2019s alarming.

NTA", "I don't think she has good intentions tbh. I think she got too attached to a strangers cat. I used to dogsit a lot for my uncle and whenever we went on walkies this weird neighbor would magically appear to pet her. She would constantly talk about her being overfed (she was perfectly fine just really fluffy fur) and even tried to take her off me because I looked too exhausted to go for a walk. I think it's similar to your case since I think that girl hopes you'll let her have the cat. Totally tell her too stop. If she wants a cat she can get one herself. NTA", "NTA. She needs to mind her own business. All of my family\u2019s cats are indoor, but a decade ago we had a feral cat who adopted us. She was up to date on shots/fixed. We tried bringing her indoors multiple times in 10+ years we had her and she would throw a fit and run out the door as soon as it opened.

You are always more than welcome to give her a pet or say hi, but please do not come to our home anymore.\u201d Then I\u2019d keep the cat indoors for a week or two to let it settle. I would get a new collar with a gps too myself.\n\nHonestly, reading this, I don\u2019t think her behavior is just youthful na\u00efvet\u00e9 and kindness; she\u2019s bypassing a lot of social norms/boundaries and is behaving obsessively. She may just be ND and struggle with cues, she may be incredibly lonely and looking for an excuse to interact, and/or she may have some mental health issues, but I think none of that is really your issue. You\u2019re entitled to your privacy and not being hounded at home. And", "NTA. We had the same issue with our cat. Told them to fuck off and put a AirTag on his collar so I could track him. Took a few fucks for them to not come back though.", "NTA and you have a real problem now.  It's possible that this woman has fixated on the cat.  Whatever her reasoning is, this is becoming ingrained behavior.\n\nIt seems to me you have two choices.  Confront her and follow up with whatever legal recourse is available to you; maybe trespass her.  Or, keep the cat inside for sufficient time to break this behavior and keep it from becoming more invasive.", "NTA. Give her the cat as a Christmas gift", "I understand that your cat is semi-feral and comes and goes as it pleases, but I feel like it would be wise to temporarily keep her indoors. It can be done, I\u2019ve known basically fully feral barn cats whose families would keep them inside for a few weeks (even months) if there were things like the threat of predator animals or some other unsafe condition because the owners love for the cat outweighed their guilt for forcibly keeping the cat indoors while it solemnly stared out the window haha. I\u2019m not debating whether or not your cat should be an outdoor cat because it sounds like it is the right choice for your cat in general, however I 100% wouldn\u2019t trust that the woman wouldn\u2019t just go ahead and steal your baby one day when she sees it wandering around. She knows who it belongs to now, so she could easily get around the whole microchip thing by not bothering to bring it to the vet because that\u2019s all a microchip is good for. And I don\u2019t know how it works in your country, but at least where I am it\u2019s basically impossible to get any pet other than a dog back from someone who steals it because they claim it\u2019s a civil matter and there\u2019s nothing they can do. I had an ex boyfriend who actually DID steal my cats once and even though I knew exactly where they were and obviously had plenty of proof they were mine, the police said they couldn\u2019t do anything about it, I couldn\u2019t file any sort of charge against them or get any sort of official help to get them back no matter who I called because literally every single answer was that they could only help if it involved a dog?? The only way I got them back was over a month later when a mutual friend of ours invited herself over to his apartment under the guise of hanging out and got them back for me (and subsequently ended their friendship with my ex lmao). And sorry for rambling, I had about 5 cups of coffee this morning so I\u2019m on another planet right now.", "NTA. I don\u2019t agree with outdoor cats, but that\u2019s my opinion; at a certain point everyone has to accept that not everyone\u2019s gonna agree with their opinions. Just because I don\u2019t like outdoor cats doesn\u2019t mean I can demand everyone else agree with me. But\u2026yeah at everyone else\u2019s advice to set a firm boundary", "NTA. It sounds like she doesn't have appropriate social skills or boundaries.  I think its okay to tell her very directly \"I know that you intended to be helpful when coming over the time but now you coming over every day is intrusive and is making us uncomfortable.  If we have any concerns or questions we will contact you.  Please do not come over again without invitation.\"", "NTA. She almost sounds like she might have a slight mental disability? That is not normal behavior. You need to tell her to stop if you want her to stop.", "YWNBTA\n\nMy family has dealt with people like this before.
