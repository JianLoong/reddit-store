We bought a house 2 years ago, and decided to host Christmas this year since we have the biggest space to do it. Everyone in my family agreed it was a great idea. \n\nOkay, so flash forward to now, i have invited my uncle to every event my husband and I have hosted. My baby shower, didn\u2019t come. Our Fourth of July cookout, didn\u2019t come last year, or this year. Our son\u2019s first birthday, didn\u2019t come, didn\u2019t even wish him a happy birthday (I\u2019m not bitter about a gift, we specifically requested no gifts on the invititation, as my son has a ton he doesn\u2019t even play with). We just hosted thanksgiving and I told the rest of the family if my uncle and his family didn\u2019t show up he wasn\u2019t invited anymore since he  never came anyways. \n\nI\u2019m mostly upset because I\u2019m the first one to have a baby in the neice/nephew, grandkid part of the family. I\u2019m upset he chose to miss really important milestones in my life. \n\nAnyway, my grandma decided to invite him regardless to my decision, and regardless to me being extremely clear I didn\u2019t want him here. \n\nMy uncle is a shady guy, he gave up custody of his son because he just didn\u2019t wanna deal with anymore, and now he is fighting for custody back because his child support got raised. His son is 16 and he has sticky fingers that like to steal, and I\u2019m just not comfortable having him in my home, neither is my husband. \n\nMy whole family (my aunt, mom & grandma) are so angry at me. My dad is on our side because he\u2019s never liked my mom\u2019s family anyways. They keep saying I\u2019m an entitled brat, and need to get over myself. I just don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m being made to feel bad for something I\u2019ve vocally expressed for a month now, and being uncomfortable with it. \n\nThey have also cancelled Christmas at my house, and they\u2019re all going to my uncles apartment. My husband and I and our son were not invited.\n\nI feel bad for my son, I feel like I\u2019m causing him to miss things, and potentially ruining things with his family. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nLet me add some things to help the confusion. \n\n1. He was invited to events because my family wanted me to invite him, I never wanted him in my house.\n\n2. I was upset when he didn\u2019t come to the baby shower, or birthday party, because those were completely outdoor events, he wouldn\u2019t have been in my home, or around our things. \n\n3. My mom doesn\u2019t like him, my aunt cant stand him, my dad hates him. The only one who enjoys his company is my grandma. \n\n4. I don\u2019t care how old his son is or what he has been through, stealing is never acceptable, nor is your past an excuse to steal. \n\n5. My uncle has chose to miss everything in my life, he doesn\u2019t miss anything for my cousins. I\u2019m bitter about that. \n\n6. He was never invited, he had no knowledge of this event, no dates, no times. My grandma went out of her way to invite behind my back. When she knew he wasn\u2019t welcome here. \n\n7. My family was perfectly fine with him not being invited prior to my grandma inviting him. \n\n", "created_utc": 1703274152, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18on5k0/aita_for_univiting_my_uncle_and_his_family_to/", "score": 396, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But then you say your uncle is a shady guy who essentially abandoned his own son.  So which one is it?  Are you actually upset at your uncle for how he treated his own son?  Or do you forgive your uncle for being a shit parent as long as he shows up to YOUR events and makes you and your baby the center of attention?\n\nYou also seem to have 0 empathy for your 16-year-old cousin, who seems to have been given an awful hand in life, and who could use some unconditional love from family members to hopefully help set him back on the right path.  \n\nI think you need to do a bit of soul searching.

I\u2019m upset he chose to miss really important milestones in my life. \n\nBut this really makes you TA. Just because you got the first grandchild or whatever doesn't actually make you special. And why would you be upset someone doesn't praise the fact you had a child enough, when you find that person shady and don't even want them in your house? You can't have it both ways.

Even bringing those up makes you look silly. You're having big feelings about him not cooing over you, your belly, your baby and your big fancy family gatherings - why the hell should you be such a central figure in his life? He may be a man of questionable character, but your ego and perspective here are all out of whack.\n\nSecond, you've got the right to not want certain people in your house, but if you're hosting *the* family Christmas and you loudly announce that a certain family member is excluded from the family Christmas, then yeah, some family members are probably going to have opinions about that.

Not him, not them.", "not projecting? & yeah she should be happy for me. but she blames me for the reason her life didn\u2019t go how she planned. she got pregnant at 19, and has resented my dad since i was  born for her not being able to do anything she wanted, and in turn has always taken it out on me. \n\ntold me at way to young of an age my dad is the only reason i\u2019m here today. she\u2019s never been like a mom, she\u2019s always tried to hard to be my friend, and now i\u2019m an adult and she is constantly comparing my husband to my dad, like they can even be compared. \n\nso yes, since i waited to have a kid, had all my fun in my 20s she does give of really jealous vibes.", "My thoughts exactly. I mean, I am sorry your uncle is rude and you shouldn\u2019t have him. T your house if you don\u2019t want him, but first you sound a little petty because he wasn\u2019t appropriately attentive (in your eyes) to the fact that his niece had the first child in the family, which I don\u2019t really understand.  To me expecting a great uncle to be excited or even attend a grand nieces birthday is a big stretch.  Then later you said he was shady, which does make sense.  If you don\u2019t care for your family, if you think they treat you unfairly, go low or no contact.  If you choose not to do that, don\u2019t be surprised if they continue to balk when you try and dictate who meets your criteria of what family members are eligible to attend family functions and which ones aren\u2019t.", "Thanks for the advice. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffc", "You\u2019re confused in a lot of these comments. Says more about you than it does OP.", "OP has main character syndrome.  Her shifting reasoning is so disingenuous.  She didn't have a problem with her uncle's unsavory life choices until he dared slight her by not showing up to all of her parties.", "No, they\u2019ve met. He loves my uncle. We go to his house occasionally when he invites us over for dinner. I don\u2019t hate him. I just don\u2019t agree with his life choices.  But that\u2019s on me I guess", "You\u2019re probably right. I haven\u2019t that far, I\u2019ve only been a mom for 15 months.", "Where did I say his behavior was justified?  You can have empathy without justifying bad behavior.  They aren't mutually exclusive.  \n\nShe doesn't have to invite a thief over to her home, but she could have recognized that he is 16, and his father abandoned him, and wow, that must have been tough.  Instead, all she did in the original post was to throw a self-pity party that that the child abandoner didn't show up to HER son's birthday, which is of course is an important milestone to HER.  So much selfishness.", "Well, okay. It's good that his father's abandonment wasn't the cause for him to start stealing. Still is bad parenting from him and his mother. You son steals and you don't correct, punish him, teach him better?", "Oh I don\u2019t care we weren\u2019t invited. It\u2019s the way my family is acting. Like it was all so sudden, so out of the blue. They don\u2019t like him anyways which is why I\u2019m so confused.", "guess they\u2019re all really good people then & you feel comfortable around them, im happy for you. Enjoy your holiday!", "Ofcourse I will. If he chooses to abandon his son, I will not be taking his side. That\u2019s a gross thing to do, and I hope I raise him better than that.", "Alrighty. It\u2019s been actual years of buildup. \n\nYou want my stack of ious for every birthday party, christmas, grad party, or event he\u2019s given me because he never shows up? \n\nOr should I give you a list of the things he\u2019s stolen from my parents house?", "That is absolutely not how family works. He is my uncle, if it was a married in spouse sure it\u2019s different since you have no issues with your brother. You aren\u2019t obligated to have a relationship with family you don\u2019t like. Nor do you have to be around them. I made the effort for him to have a relationship with my son, and now I\u2019m not anymore.", "he actively chose to single one out. it has nothing to do with my son. yes, they were event for him, but milestones for me! \n\nmy uncle has never missed ANYTHING for my cousins. ever, even the simplest thing. he has gone to every birthday party, takes off work to go to them. never did for me, always had to work. he has gone to every single event for my aunts kids. he never came to my birthday parties, or my graduation party, or even my wedding. \n\nyou\u2019re telling me i\u2019m selfish, & me me me, but i\u2019m hurt that i\u2019m the only niece he doesn\u2019t bother to acknowledge. \n\ni just think it\u2019s ridiculous that my family would even think that i want him around anymore, im so over being the only cousin that our uncle doesn\u2019t acknowledge.", "I am confused because of all the missing informations OP provided in the post and some were clarify in her comments.\n\nI still don't know why she wants so bad that her uncle be there at events she hosts since she wrote he was shady. I only discover that \"uncle's family\" meant his girlfriend, his Sil and 2 kids when she replied one comment because all \"family\" she put in the post was her cousin who is a thief and she does not want in her house\n\nI was confused about her mother too.\n\nBut know I get: OP has a problematic family and she does not realized that so try to mantain contact for the sake of her son... althought in my opinion her son - and her - are better of away from uncle, mother and everyone else.", "I\u2019ve ALWAYS had an issue.", "just a bit weird that you'd choose to have more empathy for a scruffy 16 year old who doesn't give a fuck about anyone else over OP, who has made a dozen perceived slights based on how YOU want to read the tone of her post and comments x", "Your family was rude to call you an entitled brat. \n\nBut, being real honest\u2026 I get an \u201cI\u2019m the main character\u201d tone from your post. I wouldn\u2019t tell my uncle he can\u2019t be at an extended family Christmas just because they he missed a bbq and baby shower.", "So you will abandon your child to show your child that abandoning their child is wrong?", "well, its the rest of your family that has the relationship and they want to be with him and you for christmas.  this is all about your ultimatum based on him not showing up, not the other excuses youve made - \"I told the rest of the family if my uncle and his family didn\u2019t show up he wasn\u2019t invited anymore since he never came anyways.\"  \n\n\nnow you are being the biggest pain in the ass creating a rift in your family demanding him or you - which is defo YTA stuff.    \n\n\nAs for why I tolerate my in-law - yes, I do have to be around her so that my parents can be with all their children and their grandchildren for the holidays.  If I was being you, I would be hurting my mum, my dad, my nephews and my brother, all because I cant be an adult and tolerate someone I dont like.", "For whatever reason, your uncle doesn't like you. Or he doesn't like your mom or dad, and takes it out on you. Or you have eyebrows that remind him of an ex. Or just because he's a dick.\n\nGood news! The reason doesn't matter, because you're an adult, and you get to move on with your life instead of obsessing over why this one relative doesn't like you! You get to not get into weird tit-for-tat revenge games of excluding him from the family get-together because he didn't come to your childhood events because of reasons you will never know!\n\nYou're an adult, so you get to grow the fuck up and get over it, instead of extending the drama for another generation!", "Yes, because based on Op's post, we can accurately judge that this 16-year-old \"doesn't give a fuck about anyone.\"  You're just making up facts to suit your narrative.", "he\u2019s missed everything, all my birthday parties, my graduation party after high school, my college graduation. Everything related to me. He goes to every other family function all my aunts kids parties, holidays hosted at my aunts and my parents. He literally went to my cousins middle school graduation. Everything. But nothing for me. \n\n& yeah maybe I am really bitter about that, but for them to invite someone I have zero respect for to my house after I told them not to, I think is out of line. \n\nAnd they\u2019ve thought I was entitled since I got my life together. I met a really great guy, and have a good life, and they get really annoyed I don\u2019t shit around and shit talk everyone like they all love to do.", "See that\u2019s the thing tho, they don\u2019t like him either. They think he\u2019s a shitty person, except him mom(my grandma) my mom can\u2019t stand him, and my aunt literally hates him and his kids.\n\nThey just hate the idea of a child, which is what they call me, calling the shots. \n\nFor context, my 28, my mom is 47, and aunt is 35, and my uncle is 38. I\u2019m not that much younger than any of them. \n\nI\u2019m the only one upset he doesn\u2019t show up.", "But seriously: Don't play weird tit-for-tat \"No, I'm excluding YOU\" games, because all it will do is highlight the active choice your uncle is making.\n\nYour son can't miss an uncle who just isn't around unless you insist on calling attention to the fact and contrasting it with how he's around for cousins. Your son won't miss him unless you *make* him miss him.\n\nLet it go before you pass it on.", "Ok no offense but ... this was a weird time to suddenly throw down this gauntlet. Sounds like he's just not a kid person, even towards his own kid. You also seem to place a big importance on being well off. I could see how you'd rub family members the wrong way", "so since you feel they treat you like a child, you're being extra difficult in this line you drawn in the sand.  Sounds like you have other conflicts with your family over just this.", "Uhm, my cousins are kids, he\u2019s def a kid person? & I don\u2019t ever brag about my life to them, I just shit talk my life constantly like they do.", "He abandoned his son when his son lied about stealing from him."]}
