Her mum called me and asked if I reported it. I said that I did as she is too young for TikTok and it\u2019s causing her harm. My niece came on the phone crying saying it\u2019s unfair of me.

I tried to talk to her about bullying, internet safety, the importance of taking a break and talking to safe adults etc.. But it just wasn\u2019t going in. My niece is very young for her age and very sensitive. She doesn\u2019t have many friends and has had a hard time of life so far.

A 9 year old has no need to be on Tik Tok, ever.  In fact, there is a move to ban that app in the United States.  For everybody, regardless of age.", "NTA. Children do not belong on social media and if you live in the US, it's illegal. Your sister is doing her niece a huge disservice. You need to have a talk with her about why having an illegal account is bad. Bullies aren't the only people stalking underage girls on TikTok, btw.", "NTA Tiktok is toxic. Also, why does any parent do this? Half of these adults don't need social media, let alone a child.

Your actions are tyrannical, regardless for good or bad reasons, you can't just decide and act.

You had to realise you'd be figured out sometime, and now your niece dislikes you for what you've done, even if you were doing it to protect her. Talking to the niece about the bullying and suggesting she take a break to see if she'd feel better would've been not only a much easier, but also less hurtful first step for the girl. Instead, you hurt her not once but four times.", "I don't let my 11 year old on social media.", "YTA for the way you went about it. \n\nYour intentions were good, but your niece is going to keep finding a way to be on that hideous platform, so you reporting it is sysiphian", "YTA \n\nNot stop reporting her account and report the accounts of the people bullying her. Your opinion on whether or not she should have social media is irrelevant. You are not her parent so you don\u2019t get a say in the matter. \n\nWhile I agree with her being too young, that\u2019s on her parents to decide. Repeatedly reporting the victim of bullying is punishing. No one but the victim.", "YTA. I agree 9 is a little young for tik tok. But that's the digital age we are living in. She is likely into it because all the kids at school are. Where I think you are in the wrong is 2 points. Going over the parents heads, and being overprotective. Whether you agree with them or not, it is the parents decision, not yours. As an Aunt you have some say in the upbringing of your niece, but not so much that you can change the parents decision on something like this. On the 2nd point, let the child experience some conflict in life. Oh no, somebody was mean to the little girl, it's going to damage her for life. Her feelings were hurt we need to save her. Please. Children need to learn that the real world isn't all sparkles and fairies. And it's wrong to take something away from them because of other people's behavior. That would be like telling my son he can't play baseball anymore because one of the other kids was mean to him. Absolutely ridiculous. It's the internet, there are bullies. It would be better if you taught her how to deal with criticism than to shelter her from it. Being so overprotective can and will have very negative effects when she is older. She will wind up on someone else's tik tok acting a fool in public because she doesn't know how to deal with a problem.", "YTA, you are not her mother, your opinion doesnt mean sh*t, honestly you're lucky they haven't done anything in retaliation, I get that what you're doing is coming from a good place but it's not your place to do this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You are the only adult thinking about the safety of this child.

She has a dead father, disinterested mother, and is being bullied on a public platform. A predator would see her as perfect prey due to her emotional vulnerability. \n\nPlease keep protecting this little girl.", "NTA.

It might change her mind on jow she current sees it. She also needs to learn to get a thicker skin if she is going to continue to use SM on any platform.\n\nSpeak to her mother again. Ask her to watch the documentary with you both.

Does TikTok allow users that young?", "NTA, I\u2019ve reported a clearly underage account before on tiktok. She had to be 10 max. And she was posting videos of herself. The internet is not a safe place and there\u2019s a reason why tiktok has an age of 13+", "NTA, but I worry this may be a situation where your hands are essentially tied because she can keep making accounts and pissing off her mom could lead to you being LESS available to this girl and it sounds as though she really needs you as a responsible adult in her life.  Keep on supporting her and giving her the messages that you've been trying to as far as the harms of social media, unconditional positive support, and generally being a trusted adult for her to turn to.  That might be the area that's actually within your control here.", "NTA If mom doesn't like it, she can complain to TikTok that they should allow it. Which I wish I could watch with popcorn.", "NTA but I would take the niece out for a special one on one dinner where you explain why it\u2019s not safe for her to be on social media or healthy. I\u2019d also make sure I found something she is interested in and give that experience to her - horseback riding lesson, museum trip, soccer lessons, painting classes - find out what she likes and buy her experiences in that where she\u2019s actually participating in something. That way, you\u2019re not just taking away her tik tok but you are giving her something to focus on. Good luck.", "NTA. But if your niece is lonely, she\u2019s probably using TikTok to get some much-needed social interaction. Is there any way you could help her join a club or activity where she could meet other kids? Even an all-ages knitting/drawing group over Zoom might be nice.", "NTA and I'd have just lied and said no so you are a better person than i am, lol.", "NTA for caring about the mental well being of a child since her mother doesn\u2019t seem to", "NTA,  young children should not be on every popular app available.  Bullying isn't the only threat out.

I don't have tik tok but isn't the age limit 13?", "I encountered someone this year who let their 7 year old watch TikTok for the entirety of a three hour long party, and felt like they were placing limits by not letting the child have their own account.", "That's the same age my my niece was when she got her TikTok account.  She is now 11 and my sister monitors it just as closely as she did in the beginning.  One of the first things that my sister told my niece was that not everyone wants to be recorded or have their pictures taken, so if she is going to post, to either ask permission or do so when she is at home.\n\nThe core requirements for my niece keeping her TikTok is that she can only post once per day, but my niece's phone gets taken when there is homework to do and tests to study for.  Conduct-wise, my niece cannot engage in bullying, yet needs to show my sister the comments, direct messages, and friend requests that come through her account.", "No. 13 is the age limit which is why they take the account down.", "I\u2019m actually teaching her to play piano and have bought her a keyboard for Christmas. She\u2019s really into it and she\u2019s very good! We go out a lot. I\u2019m very close to her and her sister, they even have a bedroom in my home. But when she\u2019s at home with her mum\u2026. It\u2019s not great. I\u2019ve had to go pick them up before because my SIL has just gone out and left them alone. \n\nI\u2019m seeing my niece in a couple of days and I\u2019ve got them for Christmas so I\u2019ll make some time to have a chat with her about why I did what I did.
