You are not her parent so you don\u2019t get a say in the matter. \n\nWhile I agree with her being too young, that\u2019s on her parents to decide.

She is likely into it because all the kids at school are. Where I think you are in the wrong is 2 points. Going over the parents heads, and being overprotective. Whether you agree with them or not, it is the parents decision, not yours. As an Aunt you have some say in the upbringing of your niece, but not so much that you can change the parents decision on something like this. On the 2nd point, let the child experience some conflict in life. Oh no, somebody was mean to the little girl, it's going to damage her for life. Her feelings were hurt we need to save her. Please. Children need to learn that the real world isn't all sparkles and fairies. And it's wrong to take something away from them because of other people's behavior. That would be like telling my son he can't play baseball anymore because one of the other kids was mean to him. Absolutely ridiculous. It's the internet, there are bullies. It would be better if you taught her how to deal with criticism than to shelter her from it. Being so overprotective can and will have very negative effects when she is older. She will wind up on someone else's tik tok acting a fool in public because she doesn't know how to deal with a problem.", "YTA, you are not her mother, your opinion doesnt mean sh*t, honestly you're lucky they haven't done anything in retaliation, I get that what you're doing is coming from a good place but it's not your place to do this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Keep on supporting her and giving her the messages that you've been trying to as far as the harms of social media, unconditional positive support, and generally being a trusted adult for her to turn to.  That might be the area that's actually within your control here.", "NTA If mom doesn't like it, she can complain to TikTok that they should allow it.

I\u2019d also make sure I found something she is interested in and give that experience to her - horseback riding lesson, museum trip, soccer lessons, painting classes - find out what she likes and buy her experiences in that where she\u2019s actually participating in something. That way, you\u2019re not just taking away her tik tok but you are giving her something to focus on. Good luck.", "NTA.

She is now 11 and my sister monitors it just as closely as she did in the beginning.  One of the first things that my sister told my niece was that not everyone wants to be recorded or have their pictures taken, so if she is going to post, to either ask permission or do so when she is at home.\n\nThe core requirements for my niece keeping her TikTok is that she can only post once per day, but my niece's phone gets taken when there is homework to do and tests to study for.  Conduct-wise, my niece cannot engage in bullying, yet needs to show my sister the comments, direct messages, and friend requests that come through her account.", "No. 13 is the age limit which is why they take the account down.", "I\u2019m actually teaching her to play piano and have bought her a keyboard for Christmas.

Just keep educating her and say you can be mad but you will understand one day and she will.", "I've found multiple reports sometimes make it work better (I have my main account and a secret one only for reporting). I've also asked other family to report as well with their accounts. My cousin really likes tiktok so she's always coming back and idk how serious your niece is about having a tiktok so report as much as you think necessary. It's not appropriate for anyone under 13 to have a tiktok so never feel bad for this, hopefully when she grows up she'll see that you were protecting her.", "It was very strange. My kids tried to watch for a minute or two and then went to go play. She never turned it off, even when she went to do something else, just left it playing on full volume on the floor next to her.

I want to offer some encouragement from my own experience. My poison of choice is dating apps (I'm not nine years old so it isn't as wildly inappropriate as it would be for your niece, but I mention it because there are similarities: we're both seeking engagement from people on the app.) I'm aware that I use them in an unhealthy way, and several times I've deleted them cold turkey, only to go back a few months later when I'm feeling lonely (there's often cannabis involved.) But I'm happier without them in my life. It's something I'm working on with my therapist.\n\nMy point is, these apps are designed by full-on psychologists to be as addictive as possible. They are designed to bring you back after you try to quit. I'm an adult so it's really up to me to get ahold of my \"addiction,\" but your niece is a child (a young one!) and she needs a grown-up to help her overcome the draw of this sort of thing. It sounds like her mom is completely failing her in this, so it's commendable that you've stepped in, repeatedly even, to be the responsible adult in her life.\n\n**TL;DR: the fact that you niece keeps going back to the apps is a sign of her problem with them. It's a sign that you're right, not wrong, in trying to keep her away. Just trying to fend off any discouragement you might start to feel. These tech addictions so many of us have grip us very strongly, but you're doing a great thing for your niece here.**\n\nAlso I can't fucking spell niece, thank goodness for spellcheck.", "NTA, you just want to protect your niece from the very cruel internet and the affects it can have on somebody.

The fact is that kids are on social media.  Having a private account was probably the best compromise.  And your niece was confiding in you, which gave you an opening to both ensure she was safe and to offer her guidance and support.\n\nNow both your niece and your sister won't tell you about her life and she's much more likely to be exposed to worse influences and even be targeted by predators.\n\nSometimes you need to work with shades of grey instead of insisting on black or white.", "Nta, honestly no one should be on Tiktok let alone a 9 year old.  I hope the US and others follow through on banning it.", "Good shit. Tiktok should be banned.", "NTA. She is far too young for social media. Her mother is a huge AH", "NTA.

In a time when everyone knows about grooming from creepy adults, cyberbullying from other kids (hell, even pathetic adults in some cases), that is so far past irresponsible.

A 9 year old shouldn't be on Tik Tok. She will be back on. No doubt. Her Mom is determined to NOT protect her daughter from the freak show of the social media circus.

OP, I have a nine-year-old. There's just no way I'd let someone this age have TikTok. I've told them it's one of the most toxic social media platforms I've ever seen. I have it for my business, and I often log in and just feel like I get assaulted by videos I find offensive. I don't know why they've chosen to show these videos to me when I basically log on, post a video, and log off. I can't imagine a child trying to filter through all of this, post videos when there are trolls all over social media, and then have to deal with those issues.", "In modern America, the phone is the parent.

I'd also say, if you feel comfortable, contact their school about the tiktok situation. Most schools have anonymous tip lines for students who are being endangered. And this is; in the US [if that's where you're from] it's illegal for children under 12 to have social media. It being public accounts is a safety concern as it can attract child predators, your niece is being harassed by people older than her, and her mother is aware and does nothing. The school is required to look into it, and you can phrase it as \"I'm a parent and I saw my child's classmate on tiktok being bullied.\" \n\nBut I'd also say to make sure you document the neglect first. Look through texts about her leaving them for days at a time and any that shows you've alerted SIL to the situation and her brushing it off"]}
