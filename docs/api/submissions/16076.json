If you're going to the grocery store and gonna get a treat for someone...it should probably be a snack they like...not personal hygiene products??

No one is entitled to a gift however big or small it is, the back story of being shit with money and spending it on crap food is irrelevant. The person tried to give you something and you had a negative reaction in context to a shampoo bottle - that is the underpinning element that needs to be examined.\n\nProjection of other difficulties and resentment onto the opportunity to gift appears a theme here.", "YTA and NTA think you should have accepted his gift but I think he should have known that you don\u2019t use that shampoo anymore and the fact that you did the same thing is another thing.
