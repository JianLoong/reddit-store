We needed eggs for breakfast, I would normally run out and grab it but asked for him to do it. \n\nThe reason why I do most of the grocery shopping is because he\u2019s an impulsive shopper and doesn\u2019t really understand how to buy for meals because he doesn\u2019t cook. One time I sent him out for groceries for the week and he spent $150 on snacks and drinks. \n\nWhen he came back I greeted him with kisses and thank yous for going.

That I\u2019m not entitled to a gift, he was just doing something nice and I was being mean about it. I think all of those things are true! But also it frustrates me that we\u2019ve been dating for two years and he thinks this is what would cheer me up when I\u2019m having a hard day. I asked him how he would feel if I told him I have a treat for him and I came home with (overpriced deodorant brand we no longer use that he doesn\u2019t like). He said it wasn\u2019t the same. \n\nI don\u2019t know. Overall it\u2019s a stupid fight. I apologized and said I didn\u2019t mean to hurt his feelings.

You're going through something big physically and he could be kinder to you.\n\nHe thought he was getting something nice for you. He was way off course. I've been married to one of those for 22 years. Your so must have other redeeming qualities, as mine does.\n\nHave a good conversation and tell him you need some extra love right now - not stuff. Please also have a good chat about the extravagant spending whenever he does the shopping. Hopefully it doesn't affect bill paying but if it does you'll need to find a fix for it.", "NTA, because painful periods are the worst. \nHowever you may have overreacted which is understandable. You 2 could benefit from a heart to heart talk, he needs to understand how painful these days can be. And he definitely needs to learn to be an adult about shopping.

There\u2019s a certain kind of gift giving that serves to underline the thoughtlessness of the giver. Shampoo and conditioner CAN be treats even though they are something included in many regular shops but in this case this was a really half-assed attempt at a gift. All the upset that resulted from all parties is AH behaviour though, because it was absolutely unnecessary.", "Soft YTA. It's suppose to be the thought that counts. You said he was an impulsive spender. This was an impulsive buy for you. This was him being sweet in a very clueless way.", "NTA. If you're going to the grocery store and gonna get a treat for someone...it should probably be a snack they like...not personal hygiene products?? The only time shampoo and conditioner could qualify as a gift or a treat is if the gift receiver already buys expensive hair products from like a professional beauty retailer or if they say something about wanting to try a new/expensive hair care product. Does your boyfriend have ADHD by any chance? The wild overboard disorganized shopping in the grocery store, being bad at cooking/shopping and gifting you random ass shit he thinks you would like like shampoo without even realizing that y'all don't use it anymore honestly kinda sound like some poor frontal lobe function lol but I also don't know him irl so I'm not diagnosing anyone and either way you have every right to be upset because those are not treats and realistically your deodorant example was spot on, easy to understand and is completely the same as what he did to you so for him to say it's not the same and not see that it's the same or acknowledge your perspective does have some of its own validity...I almost feel like there's willfull ignorance there", "Devils advocate ESH.\n\nI've been in your shoes, a shitty ass attempt at a gift that was not what you wanted and needed. Should not have been framed as a gift. Typical shitty partner blah blah.\n\nHowever, it sounds like there are some love language wounds going on as someone who would react like that over a gift they were not expecting or asked for points towards this. No one is entitled to a gift however big or small it is, the back story of being shit with money and spending it on crap food is irrelevant. The person tried to give you something and you had a negative reaction in context to a shampoo bottle - that is the underpinning element that needs to be examined.\n\nProjection of other difficulties and resentment onto the opportunity to gift appears a theme here.", "YTA and NTA think you should have accepted his gift but I think he should have known that you don\u2019t use that shampoo anymore and the fact that you did the same thing is another thing. Overall you both where in the wrong in my opinion.", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nYou're really not expecting too much by expecting him to know what brand you use. Also, shampoo isn't a treat. A treat is like.. him stopping by your favorite [insert hobby here] store and picking up something you like but rarely treat yourself with.\n\nCrazy how the bar for men is really on the floor if he expected you to be excited about...shampoo.", "NTA, seems like he just did this as an afterthought to justify the treats he got himself.

ESPECIALLY when you have your period. \n\nAnd his saying it \"isn't the same\" as if she bought him personal hygiene stuff he didn't really care about smacks of, \"Well you're a woman, so you're supposed to get excited about soapy things!\" I mean, I could definitely be wrong, but the implication is sort of there . . .

I sense some weapon used incompetence here.", "He usually is fairly empathetic but he missed the mark today. I did too to be fair. Thanks for being unbiased about it. Definitely could\u2019ve reacted better.", "Sorry, but I don't think it's reasonable to have to tell a grown ass man how to go to a supermarket and buy an item you've told him to get. He shouldn't need a list, but should know what's in the house and be able to (mostly) control his spending impulses. He isn't 10, and OP isn't his mum...
