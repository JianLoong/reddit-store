Before I could even decide how to handle all of it, Nancy (34F) came and took the brownies out of my hands, muttering a thanks.\n\nI stopped her and let her know that regrettably they are not for the charity event, but something I was planning on handing out since it\u2019s my b-day. She immediately got angry and asked me how big of an a-hole could I possibly be to bring free sweets to a charity event that sells sweets. I told her that I will hand them out after the event was well over and that it will not stop me from purchasing and donating. I also let her know I\u2019ll stash them somewhere so no one would know.\n\nShe told me that if I wanted to redeem myself in any shape or form I would just give them to her to put up for sale. I told her no, thar those were treats to hand out and it would feel wrong selling them when I just told about twenty people in a group chat that I was handing them out for free.\n\nNancy lost it and we got into a huge argument, repeating and arguing more of the same above. I want to stress that this is a well-known tradition in my country, handing out sweets on your b-day. People say it brings good luck and health, selling them feels very very wrong even if it is for a good cause. I ended up donating a hundred bucks and purchasing some sweets and after the event was over (about 2hours after) I handed out the brownies.

Hope you mention that to HR as well.", "Reverse uno that HR complaint. Let them know Nancy\u2019s behavior was unprofessional, that you told the group chat in advance what your plans were YET NO ONE TOLD YOU OR WARNED YOU THE CHARITY WAS MOVED. \n\n\nFolks were still free to take their brownie and make a donation and purchase. I would\u2019ve been stoked if I was a coworker to know there was a bake sale AND someone brought sweets.\n\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  I'm very curious what HR will say about this.  Keep us posted.", "NTA\n\nI would have asked if I could donate the brownies and buy them back. Since you were donating money anyway they get their money and you can hand out brownies. Nancy in no way deserves this, but it would have solved the problem at no expense.\n\nTo those who will say she has no right to take them, and she's a royal AH.  You're right, I'm just looking to keep them peace.", "WTAF. That is NOT HR complaint worthy. And NTA.\n\nIt was accidental. Not intentional. And their Comms about the event didn\u2019t reach you to know about the clash. \n\nThat said. \n\nI probably would have taken the brownies to my team, said you didn\u2019t realise it was a clash and ask for donations for the brownie. Or, depending on numbers, split the brownies in half. Half to team, half to donate. Screw Karenancy", "NTA and wtf is Nancy\u2019s problem? They moved the event up and people buy charity sweets even when they\u2019re not planning on eating them, so your brownies shouldn\u2019t have impacted their contribution at all. \n\nTell HR about it being part of your culture and that the complaint makes you feel uncomfortable and discriminated against due to your ethnicity. Not kidding.", "Nancy is wrong. Those were your brownies and you get to do whatever you want with them. You are not obligated to participate nor contribute to a charity or fundraiser.\n\nHow was it that you were not informed of the charity event switching days?\n\nNTA", "NTA. But Nancy is a big one. You handled it perfectly IMO.", "NTA you were surprised, and didn\u2019t know there was going to be a charity event. If you  hadn\u2019t been meet with with anger I\u2019m sure you cloud have found a better solution, but by the sounds of it Nancy escalated instead of asking you to wait till the event was done. \n\nGiven a moment to think about it, you could have just told her \u201dSure, and I\u2019d like to buy them all for me team.\u201d But I can\u2019t fault you for not thinking of that in the moment.", "NTA and I'd say you have a complaint against Nancy for trying to dictate what you can do with your property (and physically trying to take them away, no less). She doesn't get to tell you what you have to donate to a charity event, either. \n\nYour response to discovering the charity event was reasonable - put your brownies away until afterwards.", "NTA and file your own HR complaint. Charity is **voluntary**. Nancy should have accepted a simple no. She should not be trying to steal your brownies, to stop you from giving them as promised, or extorting you to give the the charity.\n\nHR needs to let Nancy know that her behavior is unacceptable.", "NTA. From an HR perspective, there\u2019s no complaint here. You did something you do for your team every year. It just happened to be on the same day as something your company does every year, and you didn\u2019t know. \n\nWild that Nancy seems like the one who escalated this situation to some kind of conflict, but you\u2019re the one having a complaint filed against you. Was her logic that if you gave people brownies, they wouldn\u2019t buy any for charity?", "Nancy seems like a bit of a biATCH and you are most definitely not the asshole", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
