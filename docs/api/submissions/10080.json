His name was buddy. He was a Golden retriever. Really nice dog, he was always behaved, and didn't bark that much. 10 months after they got him, buddy died. It was a sad moment for me. However, my brother and SIL acted like they didn't even care. I asked them what caused him to die and they said natural causes. I said okay and moved on with our lives.\n\nThe next thing I know is that they got another dog. He was a German shepherd and they named him Max. Honestly he reminded me of buddy, but he barked a little more than him. When I went to visit, Max looked healthy and his tail was wagging. I visited every week and everytime I visited, Max started to look a little skinny. He stopped barking and he was just laying there. The next thing I know is that Max started to vomit. My brother and SIL told me not to worry because he's \"just sick.\" And honestly, that response made me really angry. I picked up Max and brought him to the vet. Turned out that Max was really sick and that he might not make it another week. I was really angry at my brother and SIL. Thankfully, Max didn't die. \n\nI went to my brother's house and asked them if I can keep Max and they agreed. He then proceeds to tell me that they were gonna give him away anyways since they were gonna have a baby.\n\nMy blood started to boil out of anger and finally had the courage to tell them both in their faces that if they can't take care of a dog, then they're not ready to have a fucking baby. My SIL looked at me like she hated my guts and my brother told me to get the fuck out. My brother texted me that night saying I was such an asshole for hurting their feelings. Then I got a text from my mom that night too. She was on their side. And it went from my mom to my Aunt, then my aunt to the rest of the family. I basically now created a WWIII against me versus my whole family. Honestly, I don't regret anything that I said. It was the truth.

Matter of fact, any of my family members except for my cousin who was in my side. It seems like I'm the villain here and everyone hates my guts, but I don't care.

They can be well-adjusted and delightful or an out-of-control terror or something in between.  Their personality and energy levels are their own, and a bit of a crapshoot, so they may have slightly different emotional needs, but they all need a healthy diet and good medical care.\n\nThere's a lot of overlap, and the skills to deal calmly and effectively with one translate well to the other.\n\nNeglect and abuse don't magically improve because they swap in a baby for the dog.

And I'd keep calling them.\n\nWe were friendly with a couple because they were friends of our actual friends. Basically, we saw them a lot, but didn't really click with them. They got a dog because they \"wanted one.\" She was spayed, and I guess it got infected. (She was a young dog.) They didn't bring her in until she wasn't functioning. (They said they noticed, but didn't think it was a big deal.) When they finally did, the vet said the dog could be saved, but it would be expensive. They had the money. They chose to put her down, but not before taking a bunch of photos with her lying at the vet's dying. Not just horrific photos, but photos that showed just how obviously her wounds were infected. A MONSTER wouldn't have let a dog get to that point.\n\nWe didn't know about any of this at the time until the friend group blew up. Our good friends were massive animal lovers. They found out what happened, saw the photos, and went nuclear, completely cutting them off.\n\nWe agreed. It was... sick.

They got another young, healthy dog and neglected it until it was on death's door. When I brought it to the vet, they said it was so sick it would have died within the week. People who treat pets this way should not have children. If any of you are okay with animal cruelty and neglect, that says more about you than me. So if you actually value life, instead of harassing me, talk to them. See if there's anything you can say or do to make sure this dog doesn't end up dead.

IMO I think that EVERYONE should be required to take the classes we had to take for adoption in order to have a baby.

People seriously underestimate the amount of work it takes to take care of a living thing that needs to be fed, and groomed, and walked, and have their crap picked up after them, and is generally 100% reliant on you. This is why we've ended up with so many pets who are poorly trained, poorly socialized, poorly treated, and poorly fed, and end up being an annoying nuisance at best and a potentially-dangerous animal at worst.", "I'm thinking parvo, too.  They had the first dog 10 months, which is ample time to get a full series of vaccinations, so there's really no excuse.\n\nIf it WAS parvo, parvo can stay in the environment for a really long time and not much kills it except bleach.  Bringing a new (presumably also unvaccinated) puppy into a place were a dog recently died of parvo is a good way to end up with a second death.", "I will never understand these people. I have 2 rescues and have quite literally gone hungry so that they can access the healthcare they needed. When my dogs shit wrong I make sure it's checked. How could they just do that... saddening", "It is devastating to hear this. I don\u2019t have children but I do know if we had them my husband and I would have made sure they were doted on the way we have our dogs for over 14 years. I\u2019m well aware how much harder a child would be, we entirely routed our lives around what the dogs could do and what was best for them (even going so far as to choose properties that would suit them even if they weren\u2019t what we wanted). We nearly lost our boy as a pup because he came to us sick after rescue from a bad breeder and we literally switched and one of us sat with him every minute of the day for his first week so he wouldn\u2019t die alone if he didn\u2019t make it and so he wasn\u2019t scared. If you aren\u2019t willing to do that then don\u2019t get a pet and definitely don\u2019t have a baby!"]}
