His name was buddy. He was a Golden retriever. Really nice dog, he was always behaved, and didn't bark that much. 10 months after they got him, buddy died. It was a sad moment for me. However, my brother and SIL acted like they didn't even care. I asked them what caused him to die and they said natural causes. I said okay and moved on with our lives.\n\nThe next thing I know is that they got another dog. He was a German shepherd and they named him Max. Honestly he reminded me of buddy, but he barked a little more than him. When I went to visit, Max looked healthy and his tail was wagging. I visited every week and everytime I visited, Max started to look a little skinny. He stopped barking and he was just laying there. The next thing I know is that Max started to vomit. My brother and SIL told me not to worry because he's \"just sick.\" And honestly, that response made me really angry. I picked up Max and brought him to the vet. Turned out that Max was really sick and that he might not make it another week. I was really angry at my brother and SIL. Thankfully, Max didn't die. \n\nI went to my brother's house and asked them if I can keep Max and they agreed. He then proceeds to tell me that they were gonna give him away anyways since they were gonna have a baby.\n\nMy blood started to boil out of anger and finally had the courage to tell them both in their faces that if they can't take care of a dog, then they're not ready to have a fucking baby. My SIL looked at me like she hated my guts and my brother told me to get the fuck out. My brother texted me that night saying I was such an asshole for hurting their feelings. Then I got a text from my mom that night too. She was on their side. And it went from my mom to my Aunt, then my aunt to the rest of the family. I basically now created a WWIII against me versus my whole family. Honestly, I don't regret anything that I said. It was the truth. If you can't take care of one animal that just needs to be walked and fed then you're not ready to take care of a baby that needs 2x than a dog. I haven't spoken to my brother or my SIL for weeks. Matter of fact, any of my family members except for my cousin who was in my side. It seems like I'm the villain here and everyone hates my guts, but I don't care. I probably saved that baby's life they were gonna have.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676514724, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113fpm1/aita_for_telling_my_brother_and_sil_to_not_have_a/", "score": 340, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

People severely underestimate how much work a pet is, and they are worse when it comes to underestimating the amount of work they have to put into a child. I had couple friends who got a puppy and within two weeks started crying (literally, sobbing with napkins out and everything) anytime the dog was mentioned because they were 'mourning' the loss of the life they used to live before him. We found him a good family and asked the couple to give him up, which they did immediately and then called us assholes for telling them not to get another pet. They're thinking of trying for a child, and my parents told them to think about it real hard because having a child will change lives way more than a dog or a cat. \n\nI've babysat my nieces and nephews before, and it's easier to deal with five dogs than it to handle one child. And while dogs calm down as they grow older, kids get more and more difficult. I don't know why people are so obsessed with becoming parents, but some people are simply not meant for parenthood.
