Me F(28) and my husband M(28) just had our first baby girl 8 months now.  In our country it is tradition to name the babies from our parents to honor them. If it is a boy we usually give the baby name from the husband's side of the family (husbands farther) if it is a girl from the wife's family (wife's mother). Many families give the baby name from the husband's side of the family in both cases. My side of the family has the first tradition but my husband's the latter. \n\n From the beginning of my pregnancy I clarified that I don't want to name our baby from either my mother or my mother in law and my husband agreed. We have a good relationship with both of them but we didn't want to choose between one of their names, in case someone got upset and I also find their names very ordinary.  After we had our daughter my husband and I  changed our mind and we wanted to name our daughter from our mothers. We had huge fights for the past 7 months and we decided to write the names in two papers, we chose one and the name that came up was my mother's. My husband at first felt a little sad  but then as we called her by her name he got into it. After 7 months we were in piece with this matter.  \n\nThen the following day comes.. My husband visited his family and announced the name.  My mother in law didn't have any problem with that she just wants her grand baby to be happy and healthy (she is sweet and kind ). But my father in law said that if we don't call our baby by his wife's name he is not coming to our wedding neither the baptism of the baby. (He is generally very selfish and manipulative).  When my husband returned home and we talked about it I decided I didn't want my husband and his father to have this fight so I suggested to call her with both of their names (my mother in laws and my mother's name combine well) and we felt happy again with the name choice. \n\nThe following day comes he told them and again he said the same thing adding that he doesn't want to see us anymore. Now I am really mad I don't think he is even entitled to have an opinion for our baby name. I don't know what to do my husband is very sad he doesn't want to fight with his father but I don't want to change the name. He also doesn't want to change the name (because it is not fair to me) but he is afraid that he might not talk to him again. I am mad because I have backed down so much and he is not. After their last conversation I said that I am not visiting again until he apologizes and he is not seeing our baby anymore. I am of cource open to the rest of the family visiting us.

My dad was cut off, because my father college choice. My grandmother had sneak money to him and his siblings. Because my grandfather was just a dominant force. My grandfather was never physically violent, but he knew how to emotionally blackmail a person.\n\nReddit loves to tell people what a red flag is. But give your partner some grace. I could be reading more into this. But your partner is being emotionally blackmailed, it is extremely hard to cut the cord from someone who\u2019s emotionally abusive/blackmailing you.", "ESH \n\nYou and your partner had an agreement, prior to the birth, that you both backed out on. That agreement should have stayed, because fighting over a baby name for 7 months out *after the birth* is behavior you could expect from your baby in about a year. Childish. Immature. You fought over your child\u2019s name, against one another, for over half a year of your child\u2019s life. The \u201cone no two yes\u2019s\u201d rule for baby naming exists for this exact reason. One no means a name is off the table; both mothers names should have remained off the table.\n\nInstead, you each fomented rage from your families toward the other for months until you decided to force the issue through drawing the name out of a hat. Random chance. You had thousands of other names to choose from, but you both put the one name the other didn\u2019t want in the hat. That\u2019s clearly not going to resolve the situation for both of you. But chance showed you won out. \n\nThe families, father included, are also the AH because it\u2019s not their choice. But holy shit your choices as a team don\u2019t make either of you less of the AH. I\u2019d dread being around any of you, and the resentment will only keep boiling due to everyone\u2019s choices here. Tradition is no excuse.\n\nEdit: TL;DR - Both of your feelings should be taken into consideration when naming the kid, nobody else\u2019s matter.

Here in the UK you have to register the birth I think within two weeks but you get a whole year to choose a name. Saying that I've never met anyone who has waited that long, most people choose pretty quickly and just register within the two weeks (or maybe it's 4 weeks, someone correct me if I'm wrong)", "I think I was three DAYS old when I was named and for all of those three days the hospital was harassing my parents constantly to name me already (mum had complications after delivering me so we were in the hospital a while after, I don't know how long is normal to stay in the hospital after birth)", ">But my father in law said that if we don't call our baby by his wife's name he is not coming to our wedding neither the baptism of the baby.\n\nHe's giving you a gift. Take it.", "NTA, one of the things I have learned with pushy in laws is that once you stand up to them the tantrums stop. They are not gonna be breaking any relations it\u2019s like dealing with children stop the tantrums once and then there are no issues since they know the boundaries", "NTA and FIL can take a long walk on a short pier.", "OMG.  You anticipated the whole issue.  You knew this was going to happen,  you already decided it wasn\u2019t worth the trouble.  and then, in the moment of truth, you couldn\u2019t hold onto your plan.  You deserve all the drama You brought upon yourself.\n\nESH", "100% NTA he isn't even following the regular tradition. He's just being controlling and manipulative. I say name the baby what you and your husband agreed and if your FIL doesn't want to be apart of your lives because of it, that's on him. It's his loss and he should have to deal with the consequences of his irrational behavior.", "NTA.  \n\n\nIf FIL doesn't want to see his grandkid, he's only punishing himself.", "You just know this guy is living in a country where women have few rights. It's small men with massive insecurities like this that are ruining the world. NTA", "Well FIL did contribute to producing husband(& raising him) who contributed to producing fetus---so you could say that's participation....", "We couldn't chose between great grand parents as name sakes for our daughter so we chose my grandmothers middle name as her first name and hubby's grandmothers first name as the middle so that our daughter could still have her own identity, we could honour the women who meant alot to us, and we didn't have to worry about any confusion if both are in the same room.\n\nThe most impprtant opinions well actually the ONLY opinions to consider when naming a child are the opinions of the parents and your countries government (you know that list of unapproved names most if not all countries have). Trust your instincts and if you and your child's father agree on the name then that's all that matters. BUT do remind your partner that he is the father and husband now so he needs to step up and start standing up for the family he is creating with you. \n\nOh and hurry up and register that name if your baby is born and stop changing it, they will already be learning that sound and knowing you are talking to them, so stop confusing them.", "Australia it is 60 days to register birth and name", ">(mum had complications after delivering me so we were in the hospital a while after, I don't know how long is normal to stay in the hospital after birth)\n\nI have three kids, 1st was a week because he had blood sugar and feeding issues (had a friend give birth a month earlier withbher 1st and only kid and she had 2nights because of a 24hr rule and they wouldnt discharge her at 10pm). \n\n2nd the only reason I had to stay in overnight was because I had lost 1L of blood during delivery and it was part of saftey protocol to be monitored. 3rd i was induced around 7-8am delivered around10-11am and home in time to cook dinner at 5-6pm.\n\nIt all depends on complications during and post delivery and how many kids the mother has had or is having."]}
