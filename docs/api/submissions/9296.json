We were one of those couples whose relationship got greatly sped up because of the pandemic. This has been compounded by the fact that we live in a one room home and cannot get away from each other very effectively.\n\n.\n\nHe is a very nice person and I love him, but we have spent a lot of time disagreeing, to the point where I have wondered if we are really compatible long term. Our most common arguments up to this point are about s3x (I'm a 1x a day girl, he's a 1x a year guy) and about interacting (I love in depth conversations and debates, he prefers peace and quiet/ parallel play). I am giving this as background because I want to make sure I am not being biased in any way.\n\n.\n\nRecently, he told me he was going to buy property for him and his family. I was supportive, because that is a great investment for them. When he went to buy the property, my partner whipped out a check for $60,000. I had assumed he was going to put a downpayment on something, but no\u2014 he was buying it outright with a check for $60,000 that he could just... write. And pay. Without it bouncing.\n\n.\n\nI was stunned. I have been buying groceries for the both of us 95% of the time since 2020. I knew he earned a bit more than I do (he works for himself, I do social work), but the EXTENT of it... I have been draining my savings account over and over for YEARS and often having to ask my parents for help just to feed us and put gas in the car (also my expense 95% of the time). I figured that groceries were how I contributed to the household, and that he too was more or less treading financial water trying to keep us afloat. As he has pointed out, he gets things like firewood and some systems for the house that help it function(things like ikea bookshelves). He always has had money to get himself expensive electronics (drones, etc).\n\n.\n\nMy partner has no idea why I am upset about this. Every time we have discussed it, he has seemed genuinely shocked at my reaction, and no amount of my attempting to reframe it has gotten him to understand my perspective. He points out that when we get take out food (usually 1x a month) he covers it, and he covers laundry expenses (a recent development, <1 year), and he says the expensive electronics he buys he uses for his business (that much is true). He thinks I am overreacting and that I am intentionally ruining what should be a happy moment for him.\n\n.\n\nI have gone to see family for couple days to clear my head. My sisters have called my partner predatory and say he's taking financial advantage of me. I feel like I am going crazy and I am doubting myself every minute... Please, internet, AITA for feeling taken advantage of here?\n\n.\n\n**TL,DR:** Partner managed to save $60,000 while I have been financially struggling due to buying groceries for both of us for years. I feel very hurt, but he has no idea why I am upset about this and thinks I am overreacting. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:**\n\nHello everyone! The character limit made me leave out some important information.\n\nDid we sit down and discuss finances like responsible adults? Well, not exactly. He has always been secretive about how much he earns per month\u2014 he says \"it varies\". He told me early on that his income was \"a little more\" than mine, but I never heard exact numbers from him. Our finances are completely separate and always have been.\n\nWhat is my income? Well, one thing I am going to do to cut down on expenses is apply for food stamps. I qualify. That gives you an idea about my income despite having a full time job.\n\nWhat about mortgage/rent/utilities? **We have none**\u2014 no rent, no utilities, no mortgage. We live in a cabin on a larger property and trade physical labor for the landlord for rent. It was my partner's idea to help us both save money, and it sounded like a good idea to me. We do roughly equal amounts of work on the property, though if one of us is unwell or injured the other picks up the slack.", "created_utc": 1675711468, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vfhpb/aita_for_being_hurt_that_my_partner_saved_60000/", "score": 969, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Who pays for rent, insurance, utilities. If your big contributions are groceries and gas then the problem is that you either earn way too little or dont know how to save.

What are your incomes? If you divvy up the expenses fairly, and he managed to save up just because he makes more money than you or already had made money in savings, he did not take advantage of you. However, if you pay the rent, the groceries, the gas etc and he saves up every dime he earns, then yes, he has been. \n\nWhich is a separate question from what expectations are. I\u2019d be upset too to find my partner had 60k saved up that I didn\u2019t know about after years together. It doesn\u2019t sound like he views your relationship as a partnership, which is reasonable for expect when youve lived together for years. \n\nAnd that is still a separate question from why are you with him? You both sound incompatible, unhappy and uncommitted to each other in just about every way.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re not answering the info questions so I can only go off what you have provided. You only pay 95% of the groceries and most gas. Rent/mortgage, cable/internet, utilities, renters/home owners insurance, phone bill, maybe car payments and car insurance. All of that gets paid as well. Now if you\u2019re paying your own personal bills (credit cards, car, insurance) and only buying groceries, that doesn\u2019t change my opinion. All of the other household bills have to get paid. If you\u2019re only buying the groceries that means he\u2019s paying the rest. Not sure how he\u2019s the mooch if all you are asked to provide is food. \n\nAlso, if your contribution was too much for you to afford, did you ever try to have a conversation with him about that? Did you ever talk to him and ask him to cover groceries? Were you not comfortable asking because he pays for everything else? It\u2019s just odd to say your only contribution are groceries but you and your family saying he\u2019s mooching off of you. Was your expectation for him to pay everything? You\u2019re upset about this money but if he pays everything but the groceries and I don\u2019t understand how he\u2019s in the wrong or why you\u2019re upset. Do you feel he should be providing you a better lifestyle? That\u2019s how it reads. \n\nUnless you answer these info questions from many, I just can\u2019t change my vote. You contribute 1 or 2 of the smaller household expenses but are upset he\u2019s been able to save money while footing every other bill. You never mention discussing with him that you were struggling paying for groceries either. Also pointing out a business expense as a gotcha to try and make it seem like he\u2019s somehow taking advantage of you was strange.

Well, not exactly. \n\nSorry, but this is a mistake on both your parts. This should have been explicitly defined before you even moved in together. \n\nLook into cohabitation agreements. You can and should explicitly define how finances break out when moving in with a partner. Even if you don\u2019t go out and get a legal document, you _at the very least_ need to have a conversation about it. \n\nI\u2019m in a similar boat, moved in with my bf early 2021. We agreed on rent for me to pay him (he owns his condo), that the rent would include utilities, and we agreed to split the food evenly. Logistically I was the one paying for most of the food, and we\u2019d take it out of that month\u2019s rent. I noticed pretty quickly that he was underestimating the amount we spent on food each month quite drastically. It took a few hard conversations and a couple of extremely tense bill-tallying sessions for us to finally be on the same page. \n\nCommunication is key, you\u2019ve made a lot of assumptions and now they\u2019re biting you in the butt. Why is it only now that you\u2019re noticing you spend more on household expenses than him? Especially since, even though you don\u2019t know the exact amount, you know he makes more than you? During this whole time that you\u2019ve been struggling to afford food, did you let him know? \n\n\nFor me, what it comes down to is this. Has he been knowingly watching you drain your account to feed you both, or was he as oblivious to your finances as you were to his? \n\nIf he knows you\u2019ve been spending more than him while he\u2019s saving and you\u2019re going broke, NTA. A bit naive, but even if a bank leaves its doors wide open at night the robber is still to blame. \n\nOtherwise, it\u2019s ESH for being two fully grown adults that have been in a relationship and living together for years with hardly any financial communication.", "They don't pay rent, utilities or mortgage.
