I am giving this as background because I want to make sure I am not being biased in any way.\n\n.\n\nRecently, he told me he was going to buy property for him and his family. I was supportive, because that is a great investment for them. When he went to buy the property, my partner whipped out a check for $60,000. I had assumed he was going to put a downpayment on something, but no\u2014 he was buying it outright with a check for $60,000 that he could just... write. And pay. Without it bouncing.\n\n.\n\nI was stunned. I have been buying groceries for the both of us 95% of the time since 2020. I knew he earned a bit more than I do (he works for himself, I do social work), but the EXTENT of it... I have been draining my savings account over and over for YEARS and often having to ask my parents for help just to feed us and put gas in the car (also my expense 95% of the time). I figured that groceries were how I contributed to the household, and that he too was more or less treading financial water trying to keep us afloat. As he has pointed out, he gets things like firewood and some systems for the house that help it function(things like ikea bookshelves). He always has had money to get himself expensive electronics (drones, etc).\n\n.\n\nMy partner has no idea why I am upset about this. Every time we have discussed it, he has seemed genuinely shocked at my reaction, and no amount of my attempting to reframe it has gotten him to understand my perspective. He points out that when we get take out food (usually 1x a month) he covers it, and he covers laundry expenses (a recent development, <1 year), and he says the expensive electronics he buys he uses for his business (that much is true). He thinks I am overreacting and that I am intentionally ruining what should be a happy moment for him.\n\n.\n\nI have gone to see family for couple days to clear my head. My sisters have called my partner predatory and say he's taking financial advantage of me. I feel like I am going crazy and I am doubting myself every minute... Please, internet, AITA for feeling taken advantage of here?\n\n.\n\n**TL,DR:** Partner managed to save $60,000 while I have been financially struggling due to buying groceries for both of us for years. I feel very hurt, but he has no idea why I am upset about this and thinks I am overreacting. AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:**\n\nHello everyone! The character limit made me leave out some important information.\n\nDid we sit down and discuss finances like responsible adults? Well, not exactly. He has always been secretive about how much he earns per month\u2014 he says \"it varies\". He told me early on that his income was \"a little more\" than mine, but I never heard exact numbers from him. Our finances are completely separate and always have been.\n\nWhat is my income? Well, one thing I am going to do to cut down on expenses is apply for food stamps. I qualify. That gives you an idea about my income despite having a full time job.\n\nWhat about mortgage/rent/utilities? **We have none**\u2014 no rent, no utilities, no mortgage. We live in a cabin on a larger property and trade physical labor for the landlord for rent. It was my partner's idea to help us both save money, and it sounded like a good idea to me. We do roughly equal amounts of work on the property, though if one of us is unwell or injured the other picks up the slack.", "created_utc": 1675711468, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vfhpb/aita_for_being_hurt_that_my_partner_saved_60000/", "score": 445, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Who pays for rent, insurance, utilities. If your big contributions are groceries and gas then the problem is that you either earn way too little or dont know how to save.

What are your incomes? If you divvy up the expenses fairly, and he managed to save up just because he makes more money than you or already had made money in savings, he did not take advantage of you. However, if you pay the rent, the groceries, the gas etc and he saves up every dime he earns, then yes, he has been. \n\nWhich is a separate question from what expectations are. I\u2019d be upset too to find my partner had 60k saved up that I didn\u2019t know about after years together. It doesn\u2019t sound like he views your relationship as a partnership, which is reasonable for expect when youve lived together for years. \n\nAnd that is still a separate question from why are you with him? You both sound incompatible, unhappy and uncommitted to each other in just about every way.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re not answering the info questions so I can only go off what you have provided. You only pay 95% of the groceries and most gas. Rent/mortgage, cable/internet, utilities, renters/home owners insurance, phone bill, maybe car payments and car insurance. All of that gets paid as well. Now if you\u2019re paying your own personal bills (credit cards, car, insurance) and only buying groceries, that doesn\u2019t change my opinion. All of the other household bills have to get paid. If you\u2019re only buying the groceries that means he\u2019s paying the rest. Not sure how he\u2019s the mooch if all you are asked to provide is food. \n\nAlso, if your contribution was too much for you to afford, did you ever try to have a conversation with him about that? Did you ever talk to him and ask him to cover groceries? Were you not comfortable asking because he pays for everything else? It\u2019s just odd to say your only contribution are groceries but you and your family saying he\u2019s mooching off of you. Was your expectation for him to pay everything? You\u2019re upset about this money but if he pays everything but the groceries and I don\u2019t understand how he\u2019s in the wrong or why you\u2019re upset. Do you feel he should be providing you a better lifestyle? That\u2019s how it reads. \n\nUnless you answer these info questions from many, I just can\u2019t change my vote. You contribute 1 or 2 of the smaller household expenses but are upset he\u2019s been able to save money while footing every other bill. You never mention discussing with him that you were struggling paying for groceries either. Also pointing out a business expense as a gotcha to try and make it seem like he\u2019s somehow taking advantage of you was strange. I just have a feeling he\u2019s covering everything but you somehow feel he\u2019s in the wrong because he wasn\u2019t spending all of his money on you.", "NTA, but from this information alone I think you might be right on the money about not being compatible.

Like sure, social work doesn\u2019t pay much but like it should pay enough to be sustainable especially if you\u2019re reasonable about eating out and whatnot which it seems like they are??? Very confused.", "They don't pay rent or utilities so how little OP is earning that they can't afford ~500$ on groceries per month, 10k per year? Possible that there are other expenses like gas, insurance, maybe they are paying off some debt but it seems like all of this should be shared?", "She doesn't, and we don't know if he saved that all during their relationship. He could have had that sitting to the side the entire time. Is he supposed to dip into it to cover her over bill.\n\nAnd frankly I know groceries are expensive but there has to be something else going on if she's only paying for groceries and gas. That should still only average out to 900ish max for two adults.", "If you can't pay for groceries as an adult with all of your other bills covered. Something is wrong & you probably need to be single while you figure it out", "So it would be a better idea for OP partner to fully support them even though they are an adult with a full-time job?  \n\nIf she's in debt I think there's only one person to blame for that", "It is never the responsibility of one partner to subsidize the lifestyle of the other.  Never.  I don't care if they make 10x what the other does, they agree on a certain lifestyle both can afford before one person is volunteered or voluntold to pay an unequal share of the shared household expenses.", "I assumed they were splitting rent and utilities 50/50. Does her post imply he\u2019s paying for everything or did she mention in comments? Sorry I missed that! If that\u2019s the case that she *only* pays for groceries she\u2019s TA for sure. I just figured she meant that was the one area they didn\u2019t split\u2026", "Based on her update, they have no rent or utilities and he *isn\u2019t* contributing to the groceries despite making obviously more than her (who qualifies for food stamps). That\u2019s transactional. It\u2019s not sickening not to have sex when asked\u2026 that\u2019s 100% his right. But allowing her to spend money when he isn\u2019t is gross. Maybe there are other finances (cars, insurance, phones, subscriptions) that we aren\u2019t aware of that he covers. But all things otherwise being equal it\u2019s a weird relationship: they clearly seem like roommates and he\u2019s buying a house for him and his family but not them together? It\u2019s sad.", "I highly doubt OP is \"taking care of him\". \n\nShe said all she pays for is groceries and some gas.\n\nWho is paying for the rent, the utilities, insurance, car repairs, etc...?", "I doubt it, otherwise she would have mentioned the other expenses when she is so petty as to mention gas for her car and groceries.", "My partner has her own money and we equally contribute towards the bills, literally 50/50... Because we haven't spent our lives looking for someone else to box it off for us.\n\nThey are the responsibilities she is left with and she still can't honour them without resorting to borrowing money... That is on her an not something anybody should have to step in to sort for her.\n\nWhat you're really saying is that because she is struggling and he had the ability to make an investment, that he should simply pay her through life. Why?\n\nHelp comes when you start helping yourself and, from the sounds of it, she is doing the same thing, time after time and expecting different results. \n\nThat's literally madness.", "And savings.", " it can\u2019t be the only thing you pay.", "They are but they're usually significantly less than rent", "Yeah but that was up when I read it", "The whole thing sounds hinky.  They're living in a one room cabin using wood as fuel and he suddenly buys a house for him and his family with no mention of op moving in.", "Lol you think the allocations could ever justify one partner making significant savings while one goes paycheck to paycheck?", "OP has also tried to make basically the same post 3 times today, and the first 2 got removed (unclear why), yet she hasn't made any comments... I definitely have more questions here", "OP says she's a social worker. A couple of years ago I got a job offer for 28K in Chicago.", "The government?", "It's possible but I suspect, judging by her tone alone, she would have mentioned if she were paying for anything else.  She made it clear that she was paying for groceries and gas sometimes but does not mention anything else.  The fact that she has not come back to answer any of those questions makes me think she believes groceries and gas are her only responsibilities.", "Literally that, yes. Alternatively, they can downsize to a level of living that OP can afford to contribute to adequately. The point is not who pays more: the point is that you can't have a relationship where only one partner struggles financially.\n\nThis relationship clearly won't work out for a number of reasons, one of which is that her savings account is being drained while his isn't.", "Ok well she's not an AH for her feelings.", "Groceries are typically much more than utilities (particularly with prices right now and particularly if you include household goods). They may not be as much as rent, depending on where you live, but it can be substantial and certainly \u201creal\u201d to whoever is paying.\n\nAlso according to her edit groceries are their *only* bill. So she\u2019s been carrying essentially their entire financial load.", "So if you pay multiple \u2018real\u2019 bills your food is free because it\u2019s not \u2018real\u2019? How do I get this free food?? Do I show my bills at the supermarket?", "If she has a job and her only bill is groceries. & still can't afford it in her budget. She's either not working enough hours, or spending her money unwisely in other areas.\n\nI mean they're not married and if he's covering all other bills, it's fair for her to be solely in charge of groceries.", "Devils advocate but the auto remove feature is pretty zealous and if anything isn\u2019t up to snuff it\u2019ll yank the post. OP might have just struggled with posting", "I know Social Workers get paid terribly but if her only house hold bills are groceries and her own gas. She should be able to afford that without borrowing money", "She updated about the rent/utilities", "Real world here.... That's not how it works.\n\nThat's called being a leech and a user... She can't afford food or fuel, how much more downsizing should happen to cater for this womans inability to earn money or budget properly?\n\nHow do you drain a savings account, whilst also borrowing money, every damned month? How is it physically possible? \n\nPeople need to learn to provide for themselves instead of holding their hands out looking for the easy ride... Do the work, reap the reward.\n\nThe world owes you fuck all.", "To quote another well known AH...\n\n\"Facts don't care about your feelings\"", "Ok, do you really think someone who only pays for groceries is coming to AITA to say they're \"financially struggling\" to be a sugar baby? Come on now", "That is a fair point. Given that they censored sex, I assume that they were throwing everything at the wall at that point.", "The world owes you fuck all. That is correct. What does the world have to do with anything here? This is OP and her partner. He can break up with her, or ask her to pick up more hours, or work with her to downsize their lives to something she can afford without draining her bank account, or take on more than his share of the expenses.\n\nWhat he can't do, is watch her financially struggle alone and expect a long and happy relationship out of that. It sounds like they should break up anyway.", "Well she hasn\u2019t told us so we don\u2019t know. He very well may be paying a fair share and she may just be bad at managing money.", "I refer you back to the beginning of all this.... If she's not willing to up her own life then why should anyone else?", "Yeah, and he may very well have gotten $60k from a briefcase he found on the street, not a ton of point of painting everyone in a story as a bad faith actor just because they haven't added comments lmao", "Because he is, for now, her partner, and so it's their life, not his and hers separate lives. It would be very smart of him to end the relationship, but until he does this is their problem to solve together.", ">Lol you think the allocations could ever justify one partner making significant savings while one goes paycheck to paycheck?\n\nSo to answer your question- if he\u2019s paying his share of the bills and saving money, it\u2019s *entirely* justified.", "But you\u2019re also making inferences without having any info to support it.", "And... He is, by limiting the things she has to contribute to, and, she still can't keep up!\n\nYou're getting away from the meat of the post though. \n\nI agree, he should dump her freeloading ass and then she can afford nothing at all... Win - win for everyone."]}
