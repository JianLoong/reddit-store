Our most common arguments up to this point are about s3x (I'm a 1x a day girl, he's a 1x a year guy) and about interacting (I love in depth conversations and debates, he prefers peace and quiet/ parallel play). I am giving this as background because I want to make sure I am not being biased in any way.\n\n.\n\nRecently, he told me he was going to buy property for him and his family. I was supportive, because that is a great investment for them. When he went to buy the property, my partner whipped out a check for $60,000. I had assumed he was going to put a downpayment on something, but no\u2014 he was buying it outright with a check for $60,000 that he could just... write. And pay. Without it bouncing.\n\n.\n\nI was stunned. I have been buying groceries for the both of us 95% of the time since 2020. I knew he earned a bit more than I do (he works for himself, I do social work), but the EXTENT of it... I have been draining my savings account over and over for YEARS and often having to ask my parents for help just to feed us and put gas in the car (also my expense 95% of the time). I figured that groceries were how I contributed to the household, and that he too was more or less treading financial water trying to keep us afloat. As he has pointed out, he gets things like firewood and some systems for the house that help it function(things like ikea bookshelves). He always has had money to get himself expensive electronics (drones, etc).\n\n.\n\nMy partner has no idea why I am upset about this. Every time we have discussed it, he has seemed genuinely shocked at my reaction, and no amount of my attempting to reframe it has gotten him to understand my perspective. He points out that when we get take out food (usually 1x a month) he covers it, and he covers laundry expenses (a recent development, <1 year), and he says the expensive electronics he buys he uses for his business (that much is true). He thinks I am overreacting and that I am intentionally ruining what should be a happy moment for him.\n\n.\n\nI have gone to see family for couple days to clear my head. My sisters have called my partner predatory and say he's taking financial advantage of me. I feel like I am going crazy and I am doubting myself every minute... Please, internet, AITA for feeling taken advantage of here?\n\n.\n\n**TL,DR:** Partner managed to save $60,000 while I have been financially struggling due to buying groceries for both of us for years.

Who pays for rent, insurance, utilities. If your big contributions are groceries and gas then the problem is that you either earn way too little or dont know how to save.

What are your incomes? If you divvy up the expenses fairly, and he managed to save up just because he makes more money than you or already had made money in savings, he did not take advantage of you. However, if you pay the rent, the groceries, the gas etc and he saves up every dime he earns, then yes, he has been. \n\nWhich is a separate question from what expectations are. I\u2019d be upset too to find my partner had 60k saved up that I didn\u2019t know about after years together. It doesn\u2019t sound like he views your relationship as a partnership, which is reasonable for expect when youve lived together for years. \n\nAnd that is still a separate question from why are you with him? You both sound incompatible, unhappy and uncommitted to each other in just about every way.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re not answering the info questions so I can only go off what you have provided. You only pay 95% of the groceries and most gas. Rent/mortgage, cable/internet, utilities, renters/home owners insurance, phone bill, maybe car payments and car insurance. All of that gets paid as well. Now if you\u2019re paying your own personal bills (credit cards, car, insurance) and only buying groceries, that doesn\u2019t change my opinion. All of the other household bills have to get paid. If you\u2019re only buying the groceries that means he\u2019s paying the rest. Not sure how he\u2019s the mooch if all you are asked to provide is food. \n\nAlso, if your contribution was too much for you to afford, did you ever try to have a conversation with him about that? Did you ever talk to him and ask him to cover groceries? Were you not comfortable asking because he pays for everything else? It\u2019s just odd to say your only contribution are groceries but you and your family saying he\u2019s mooching off of you. Was your expectation for him to pay everything? You\u2019re upset about this money but if he pays everything but the groceries and I don\u2019t understand how he\u2019s in the wrong or why you\u2019re upset. Do you feel he should be providing you a better lifestyle? That\u2019s how it reads. \n\nUnless you answer these info questions from many, I just can\u2019t change my vote. You contribute 1 or 2 of the smaller household expenses but are upset he\u2019s been able to save money while footing every other bill. You never mention discussing with him that you were struggling paying for groceries either. Also pointing out a business expense as a gotcha to try and make it seem like he\u2019s somehow taking advantage of you was strange. I just have a feeling he\u2019s covering everything but you somehow feel he\u2019s in the wrong because he wasn\u2019t spending all of his money on you.", "NTA, but from this information alone I think you might be right on the money about not being compatible.

There is no person taking financial advantage of anyone since he is covering dam near everything.", "My guess, a person who pays all the expenses and his gf only expense is to buy groceries but she could barely afford to do that", "Op says groceries is how she contribute to the household.  Doesn't mention contributing to rent, utilities and every thing else needed to survive.  \n\nSo if she's complaining she paid groceries, quoting you big deal", ">I figured that groceries were how I contributed to the household\n\nThis kinda implies groceries are her only monetary contribution to the household.  The lack of discussion on rent and utilities, the largest household expenses, is telling.  \n\nOf course this would imply mummy pays for almost nothing, and that his money is for living and his toys.", "Who pays the rent, gas, electric, water, rates, taxes, internet, streaming and phones though?\n\nAll we know is she pays for petrol and food, then she is out of cash... Everything else is a stretch of assumption at best, no?\n\nWhy are people never after the EQUAL part of EQUALity?", "Who paid the  rent, gas, electric, water, rates, taxes, internet, streaming and phones?\n\nSeeing as she was out of cash and had to borrow before the petrol and food was bought, you've got to ask, no?", "Didn't see where she mentioned who paid the  rent, gas, electric, water, rates, taxes, internet, streaming and phones...\n\nCrazy you saw the bit where she's being abused though...

At the end of the day who cares if it\u2019s free because of a job benefit, OP would still be benefiting by not paying rent and her partner would have extra because no rent expense", "If she can't afford the groceries, she can't afford the groceries and they need to attend to that together or break up.

It sounds like they never really had a conversation about how they were splitting expenses, and they just fell into their patterns.

But she did say she considered her paying for groceries was her contribution to the household.  Wouldn't you think if she was paying rent she'll be mentioning that as well. \n\nBut let's stay with that. Let's say he is paying all the other expenses and all OP is paying is groceries. Are you really defending that she has the right to complain?", "Don't you think if OP paid half rent that'll be her complaint?  Not that I paid all the groceries *which is what she mentioned as her contribution to the household"]}
