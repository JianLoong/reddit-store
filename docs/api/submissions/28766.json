When a straight male goes around claiming that a woman is abusing him, he often meets with considerable skepticism\u2014as well he should. But when we look at two people of the same sex, how are we to tell which one is abusing power? A quick glance won\u2019t give us the answer. The result is that a same-sex abuser can often convince people around her, and sometimes even her own partner, that she is the one being abused. When lesbians or gay men go to agencies for help with relationship abuse, it is not unheard of for the abuser to say that she is the victim and for the victim to say that she is the abuser! Sometimes the abuser succeeds in getting support and sympathy for quite a while before service providers catch on to the fact that they are assisting the wrong person.\"     \nWhen a man claims he is a victim he should be treated with scepticism. And a \"quick glance\" can't tell who the abuser is. They explicitly say a man can abuse a woman partner, and in same sex relationships a man can abuse a man and a woman can abuse a woman, but the idea that a woman can abuse a man is utterly dismissed. They do *not* say they are just using man for convenience.  The specific explanation in the terminology section says \"In addition, I have chosen to use the terms he to refer to the abusive person and she to the abused partner. I selected these terms for convenience and because they correctly describe the great majority of relationships in which power is being abused. However, control and abuse are also a widespread problem in lesbian and gay male relationships, and the bulk of what I describe in this book is relevant to same-sex abusers.\"    \nNo mention that women can be abusers, just men can abuse women, and there are also same sex relationships. That's it. No thought of a relationship where a woman could be abusing a man. That possibility simply does not exist, hence their comment that any man claiming such *should* be treated with scepticism.     \nAlso, Lundy is a man, not a \"she\"."]}
