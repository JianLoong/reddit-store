She's not entitled to an explanation, and she's also not entitled to freak at you like that", "NTA. It isn't your place to use other people's trauma to deflect your mothers abuse of you.

The important thing is that you make Jules and Alex feel safe, which you did and must continue to do so.", "Holy crap. You are sooooo NTA. Does your mother live with you?

Do not tell her personal things about a kid that isn't even your kid - it's none of her business and you already know she has a big mouth. You did the right thing. Your mother is the problem here. Why does she think a grown ass man owes her a specific explanation when you covered your responsibilities just fine?

You did exactly what needed to be done during Jules' breakdown. The trauma she endured from her bio-dad is still very close to the surface ready to be triggered anytime. Glad to see that she is already in therapy. With your love and her continued therapy she is on the right path to healing instead of simply pushing down and avoiding the issue. It will take time. I hope she has no contact with bio-dad.\n\nThe cows can wait, The hay will keep, My dear girl is hurting, I'll rock her to sleep.", "The daughter may not even understand why she felt that way. My dad used to slap me upside the head (he called it knocking the lights out of me or something like that) and I left when I was 12 to live with my grandparents. I already was stressed out trying to be happy bc that's why I left but then coping with a big change in how things around me suddenly mattered was tough too. Before I left all that mattered in my life was the time between when my dad came home and I was sent to my room because in that 30 minutes I would be insulted, accused of random stuff, punished for being a child with needs, and slapped in the face really hard all the while being told I wasn't allowed to cry or even talk bc I'd get slapped again for speaking. Once that was behind me I was completely overwhelmed and out of my depth just trying to deal with normal stuff. School, friends, homework,  none of that mattered before because my whole world revolved around that daily slap in the face and being sent to my room. And, sadly, I had no support bc no one understood that adjusting would be difficult. Getting a child away is one thing. Helping them adjust to living without that enormous stress is another. I think I became troubled bc I internalized that level of stress and had no ability to chill except for depression.  I had two modes, stressed or depressed. Which I was just repeating the first 12 years of my life's muscle memory bc that was the only coping method I knew. I wish someone would have showed me how to be compassionate towards myself. How to be responsible for my needs as a student, as a friend, with my money, etc... because respecting my personal needs was not natural for me. When a child lives with an abusive parent, the parent treats the child's normal needs for love and for instruction, or even basics like food and a home as something bad. The abusive parent lets the child know that their needs are nothing, the parent's needs are all that matters. It can turn a normal child into a ball of nerves and make them really bad at acknowledging and respecting their own needs and managing their time and resources. Love and support builds confidence and helps the child adapt. I probably was emotionally a lot younger than I was in actual years because of the abusive home life. Had I just had someone who knew a little tiny bit about abuse it could have helped make a big difference.", "Bro you are not eh Ah...but in a somber note (sorry) what your stepdaughter did is mostly caused by intense trauma...I do not think that your wife explanation is true...I would seek help with this...that is not normal.", "NTA at all.
