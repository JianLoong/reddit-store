Let them know that you both wish you could attend all of their graduations, but due to the timing it isn\u2019t possible. See how your daughters feel. \n\nThen plan to do something special with the daughter/daughters whose graduation you miss. If you miss the twins do a special outing with them. If you miss the older daughters do one with her. Your wife should also do this for the twins as well regardless if you end up going to the twins.", "NTA. There is only two graduations that count, High school and college. The rest is just passing from one grade to another.", "NTA\n\nOkay, simple solution: swap with the wife. Say that if she feels so strongly about it, she goes to the middle school graduation, and you go to the high school one. Her reaction will tell you how she really feels about it.\n\nTo be honest, the whole situation is just unfortunate and showcases some very lackluster planning by the school board. Maybe just the counties I grew up in, but high schools, middle schools, and elementary schools all have their graduations at separate times.

Usually folks go out to lunch or have everyone over for a party or something. Make sure that you let everyone know that you\u2019re going to miss the actual graduation but not the celebration afterwards.

At one point I had a high schooler in a private school, middle schooler in a second district, and elem in yet a third. None were in the district we lived in either! \n\nOP not the asshole. Even though the twins are going to be disappointed, they will have a high school graduation to look forward to. As others have said, sucks for everyone. Make sure someone videos both so all of you can sit down and watch both ceremonies and cheer for the others. Many schools had to do graduation via some sort of telecom in 2020. It wasn\u2019t the norm but I\u2019m pretty sure kids still graduated.", "4K graduations are entirely to take adorable pictures to display at high school graduation.", "It\u2019s not the grad they will remember. But they will remember their dad dismissing this moment as important to them. They will remember dad promising to show up, and bailing. One year my elementary school put on a play of the wizard of Oz. I was in grade 1, and played one of the many munchkins. My mom promised to be there, she was a no show. I don\u2019t remember much about the play, or my role, but to this day 40 years later, I still remember how I felt that my mom didn\u2019t show up.", "It will be more devastating to the older daughter for her dad to miss her high school graduation than it will upset his younger daughters for him to miss the middle school graduation. Heck we don't even know for sure if the twins give a crap about their middle school graduation they might not. \n\nMy mom lives in another state, she still came when I had my high school graduation", "I was going to ask, have they asked the twins how they feel about their graduation? They may even feel more included by attending their sister's ceremony and going out to celebrate them all. I would have been stoked to be given parental permission to skip something like middle school graduation. But everyone is different, so I would say just ask. If they want a parent there, maybe you and your wife can play rock paper scissors.", "Yeah, high school graduation is partially a big deal because it\u2019s the entry point to adulthood - whether or not you\u2019re 18 the day of the ceremony, whether or not you\u2019re going to college, it\u2019s a time of huge changes for everyone. Middle school graduation just means you\u2019re going to a different building the next year.", "My sister went to her college graduation (finished in December but the ceremony was only in May) and only my dad went with her. I think you had to stand and it was outdoors & my mom didn't want to deal with it.", "Also last semester of a grad program is grueling. I had a hard enough time getting all my term papers and exams in, thinking about getting the regalia and applying for the ceremony where the school wasn't even going to give me the diploma (my school mailed them) was just too much extra.", "This.\n\nA good chunk of the kids who go to these are literally only there because their parents make them go. Ive participated in a middle school graduation and attended 4 others. There was maybe 3 or 4 kids who were actually excited. Everyone else was either talking or playing on their phones or looking bored out of their minds.\n\nI'd definitely reccomend talking to the daughters first, but saying that its absolutely 100% important to them seems like a stretch.", "I think we maybe got an awards dinner if you had good enough grades. Also a special 8th grade dance.", "Where I live we didn\u2019t have middle school. It was elementary school  which was Kindergarten to grade 8. Then a grade 8 (elementary school) graduation. I\u2019m glad my area didn\u2019t have a middle school.  Whenever I read or heard of middle school, it always seemed odd and unnecessary", "Eh, college graduations are way earlier than High School ones. And often more than one ceremony; for the whole class as well as the departments. That\u2019s a non issue", "Caveat here though: father is trying to be at two celebrations at once vs just not showing up\n\nI'm sure if OP talked this out with the family, the twins may understand and say yea go to big sis's graduation", "Yeah the school system is different and the worst part is it differs regionally. I\u2019m from Washington where essentially each town had its own school district, at least for small towns. And each district really only had one high school most of the time. I was shocked when I moved to Utah and one school district spans half the county and each district has several high schools.", "I feel hopelessly antiquated by all of the lesser grade graduations that exist now. A friend posted about their kid's preschool graduation! I honestly don't get it, to me graduation is the culmination of your K-12 years.", "I did do 6 weeks at petsmart and after the test we did indeed spend 20 min getting graduation cap dog photos - my dog waits like a champ for my photo ops and she was adorable.\n\nAnd i did pay like, 135 for this class or something? Worth it.", ">on what is, for them, a milestone.\n\nno kid gives a single fuck about graduating middle school. no kid believes for one second that it is a milestone. parents have choosen to make it into a big deal when it isn't one. there is literally no difference between this and graduating any other grade before it.\n\n>This will be a formative memory/experience for them\n\nyou have some really crappy formative memories if you actually believe this.", "When I moved from primary school to secondary school only about 5 of my year group came to the same school as me. I will note I went to a particularly small primary school with only about 30 students per year group so that was about 16% of the students. But it wasn't that we were weird outliers and the other 84% went to the same place they were scattered around the other various schools in the town. \n\nEach school with have a catchment area you have to live in to be eligible to send your children there but they overlap massively so the children are not just automatically fed through to the corresponding school you have to make a choice and apply for a place where you want them to go. I think my parents took me to open evenings for about 6 different secondary schools before narrowing it down to two and letting me pick between those two.", "The mid-90s for me and it was just the last day of school. High school \"orientation\" didn't happen until the end of August/beginning of September, depending on when Labor Day fell.\n\nWe got a \"diploma\" which had everyone in the class's name on it in tiny print with some \"Class of 1995\" on it or something on the last day of school; I know we got one when we left 5th grade as well, so it would make sense that they did it for middle school as well.\n\nBut in our school district (which was a small school district), the high school graduation was like 2 weeks before the end of school for everyone else. It was also on a Saturday and took place at noon.", "I remember it being a big deal to me, graduating middle school. You\u2019re finally a big kid, nearly a teenager. It matters. I would have been crushed if my parents didn\u2019t attend. \n\nIt\u2019ll matter to them, during the graduation and after. And twins will be hurt that neither of their parents bothered to come and see them graduate. Acting like it is no big deal, diminishes this moment for them, and makes you an AH along with OP\u2026. So you are in like company. Just because it\u2019s not a high school graduation, does not make it less important to the two girls. It might not be important to you, but it will be for the twins. \n\nDad needs to do better. Or his younger children will resent him.", "We got nothing until high school. Literally nothing.", "yes, so much better for the older daughter to have her resent him for missing her *actual* accomplishment \ud83d\ude44 you can think I'm an asshole all you want, but even your comments make it clear that you don't still view your middle school graduation as as big of a deal as you did then, and in a years time, provided they actually care right now as it is, neither will they. the older daughter will remember her father's absence far more keenly than the twins.", "In the long run, it\u2019ll be less significant in the twin\u2019s lives, true. Other life events will surpass this graduation. But it will still be significant for years to come, to them. \n\nThe memory of neither parent attending this event for them, will linger, as well. And it will set the tone on how reliable dad is to them, when it comes down to the nitty gritty. It\u2019ll certainly hurt his relationship with his younger children, in the immediate future. And it\u2019ll tell the twins that they matter less to their dad, then their big sister does. The seeds of hurt, anger, and resentment, will grow from that. \n\nNext, dad will favour his oldest girl\u2019s university graduation, over their high school graduation. ETC. They will expect to always be in second place, when it comes to their dad with regards to their big sister.\n\nGive it a few years, will see a relationship advice post from OP that asks why his younger daughters don\u2019t bother much with him."]}
