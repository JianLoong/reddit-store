No diploma is conferred. Your older daughter actually is graduating from high school and receiving a diploma.", "Perhaps bring this up with all the daughters together. Let them know that you both wish you could attend all of their graduations, but due to the timing it isn\u2019t possible. See how your daughters feel. \n\nThen plan to do something special with the daughter/daughters whose graduation you miss. If you miss the twins do a special outing with them. If you miss the older daughters do one with her. Your wife should also do this for the twins as well regardless if you end up going to the twins.", "NTA. There is only two graduations that count, High school and college. The rest is just passing from one grade to another.", "NTA\n\nOkay, simple solution: swap with the wife. Say that if she feels so strongly about it, she goes to the middle school graduation, and you go to the high school one. Her reaction will tell you how she really feels about it.\n\nTo be honest, the whole situation is just unfortunate and showcases some very lackluster planning by the school board. Maybe just the counties I grew up in, but high schools, middle schools, and elementary schools all have their graduations at separate times.

My middle and high schools weren\u2019t. \n\nShouldve never agreed on the split if you\u2019re just going to dip out of the agreement. Also can y\u2019all not read? Half the FAMILY is going to each so the mom isn\u2019t going to be the only one at the hs graduation.", "Have you asked the high schooler how they feel? Some kids could care less about graduation and who attends. I'd check with them first and go from how they react. Middle schoolers could be given a special meal out of you end up not going. Your wife should let you choose, just as she did. If it's that important to her that someone be at middle school, she can go. NTA", "NTA", "Hey first off NTA. School district fault. How far apart are they geographically?  \nIt's not like they are giving out the diplomas at the same time.\n\nCan you not figure our a way to participate in both? Like show up for the after ceremony for the twins and be there for the high school diploma giving out? I'm sure there might be a way to participate in both... and then there doesn't have to be the drama...", "YTA if you don't go to the one actual graduation that's happening that day.", "I had an elementary school graduation it was dumb", "YTA if you don't go. Yes, we all can recognize here that high school graduation is way more significant and important than a middle school graduation, and it sucks you're in this position, but it's likely your kids graduating middle school wont see it that way, they'll see it as not being picked by their parents as THEM not being important enough - even if they can be mature and say it's ok, there's a good chance it hurts anyway. I mean nobody here knows your kids and their wants and needs and the dynamics, but that older sibling vs younger sibling hierarchy is real and I think it sends a message if the parents don't split graduations. you can find something special to do with all of them after as well.", "YTA and NTA", "Here is the thing.\n\nI get that in the grand scheme of things, it's a bigger deal to graduate HS than middleschool.\n\nBut it's a milestone nonetheless and, for your younger daughters, it is THEIR milestone. The fact that you both cannot be there can be excused, it's not within your control really, but if neither of you go, the twins are probably going to be hurt and feel let down.\n\nIf you have told them you were going, you should go, and not go back on your promise.\n\nIf you have not, have you suggested trading with your wife? If she honestly feels strongly about this, she should accept. Heck if I were her I'd likely have offered the trade to you already, since I'd want to attend both equally and you seem to prefer going to the HS graduation.\n\nNAH except the school district maybe lol", "Make the wife go if she wants to guilt trip you.  Why does she get first dibs.", "NTA Sounds like terrible planning on the school systems part. You should complain about that to an administrator.", "Ywnbta I agree that high school graduation is a much bigger milestone (my school didn't even do middle school graduation). I think your twins will understand your absence if you explain it. If your wife thinks it's so important, she should attend the twins' graduation.", "High school graduation trumps middle school. Sounds like your wife is not too fond of your eldest.", "NTA, with a big caveat. Do NOT the twins find out about you missing their middle school graduation AT the graduation.", "NAH  \n\n\nBeing a parent sucks sometimes. This is one of these times. You just can't win in this situation. You lose a landmark or you risk to disappoint your other daughters. Personally I would bite the bullet and do what is better for the children even if it meant disappointment for me. I would go to the middle school thing. It's not as important, but it's important for the little ones.", "YWBTA.  Your daughters only graduate middle school once.  If you skip their graduation, they are going to feel like you don't care.", "I couldn't agree more. so, NTA, but the school... mega AH.", "Yeah the school district needs to be contacted and told this is unfair to parents and the kids. I am sure op is not the only one who lives in this district going to have this issue.", "These might be private schools (one or both)", "It happens in our district all the time bc the middle school and high school are different districts and the high schools are regional (multiple towns) so it's impossible to get right for everyone", "Yeah have to agree. My son graduated from middle school and it was a drive through ceremony. Drive in, get your certificate, refreshments, pictures, drive out. The school decided to keep it post pandemic and the big ceremony is for the high schools. That\u2019s a great idea imo.", "Congratulations! You have completed elementary school. Not quite the same accomplishment.", "It's not stupid crap for OP's daughters though. That's the thing.", "NTA everyone including your daughters should skip that middle school bullshit. The first graduation that matters is high school, before that it\u2019s just nonsense.", "Totally agree with this, high school graduation >>> middle school graduation for sure. \n\nBut something about the wife saying the twins would be crushed if the dad picked their older sister\u2019s graduation makes me wonder if there\u2019s an unnamed dynamic of favouritism (or perceived favouritism) at play here.", "But how would the kids feel when everyone else's parents are there, but theirs's didnt show up? This is so hard for all.", "I agree with you completely. I think it might be nice for a family to have some sort of small celebration in recognition of a successful school year completed, but to make completion of nearly every year of school a \u201cgraduation\u201c really diminishes the achievement of high school graduation and college graduation, which are milestones. Sorry, I don\u2019t think successfully negotiating pre-K warrants a graduation ceremony.", "I think high school graduation is stupid, but YMMV. For the vast majority of high school graduates, graduating from high school is not an achievement. It's just an observation that some time has passed. Sure - there are some people for whom making it all the way through high school without dropping out or failing is a big deal. Most people aren't in that position.\n\nFor most people, being admitted to a first choice college is a much bigger deal than graduating from high school. Getting good grades on AP tests is a much bigger deal than graduating high school. Winning medals at some sporting or academic event is a much bigger deal than graduating high school.\n\nThe undergraduate degree is the first graduation that most people will encounter that represents an actual achievement (ie. there was any kind of realistic chance that they might not succeed.)\n\nGraduating high school is sort of like passing the driving test in most US states. It's a marker of progress on the path to adulthood, but is very difficult to actually fail.", "How dare you ignore the time-honored tradition of pre-school graduation like this?!", "Agreed", "\u2705", "Yes! I was going to ask for INFO: who decided who goes to what? Maybe reevaluate and figure it out.", "Agreed. I went to private school and even they made sure not to schedule our graduation on the same day as the local high school.", "Definitely not a graduation; no diploma or degree conferred. It's a promotion...and required to enter 9th grade.", "If he hasn\u2019t promised, I would say go to the high school graduation.", "I think you misread the post (which I did too, at first). Wife is attending the high school graduation, OP was originally going to attend the twins' graduation but changed his mind.", "How is it an amazing accomplishment to go from one required grade to another required grade?", "OP\u2019s wife isn\u2019t \u201cguilt tripping\u201d or \u201cshaming\u201d him. She\u2019s stating facts. One of the benefits of having two parents in the household is that when the kids each need a parent at the same time, the parents can split up to meet each child\u2019s needs. It sucks that this happened but OP doesn\u2019t have to make it worse by creating more problems in his household.", "Yes, there is. OP\u2019s wife attends one ceremony while OP attends the other. It\u2019s not perfect but it\u2019s fair and it won\u2019t cause resentment among the kids.", "For real. In my county, with over a dozen high schools, those graduation ceremony dates are respected by everyone. Even the PRESCHOOLS don't schedule their wee graduations on those days. I can't imagine a middle school thinking \"I'm sure this will be fine and none of these students have older siblings.\"", "Nobody \"graduates\" middle school.  It's a (required) *PROMOTION* to continue to 9th grade. There is no degree or diploma conferred. \n\nEveryone does not graduate hs. It's an achievement,  certainly deserving recognition.", "There is no such thing as graduating middle school. You don't get a middle school diploma. It was a nice thing to do for the kids but it's not really a thing.", "Lol no high school graduations just actually are more important.", "You\u2019ve got your golden children mixed up. They\u2019ve got half the family attending a middle school graduation. That isn\u2019t even a real thing. They\u2019re finishing one grade and going to another. I wouldn\u2019t even contact my extended family to attend that.\n\nIf I was the daughter hitting a legitimate life milestone, finishing 13 years of school, and having to share the spotlight (and my parents) with siblings who are doing nothing more that finishing 8th grade, I\u2019d be insulted.", "No his eldest daughter will feel like her family doesn\u2019t care either way. Why does the whole family get to go to the youngest ceremony but only 1 person shows up for her highschool graduation.", "They might also be public schools in separate districts. Where I live, there are three public school K-8 districts that all feed into the same public high school, and the high school is administered as its own distinct school district. The high school board and the feeder boards all have some communication with each other about shared issues like bussing, but I could see a conflict like this happening here pretty easily -- the inter-district politics get unbearably stupid sometimes.", "Yeah it\u2019s tough, as an adult now I realize they\u2019re pointless ceremonies but as a kid I remember it being a big deal and I would\u2019ve been upset if my parents weren\u2019t there.", ">to make completion of nearly every year of school a \u201cgraduation\u201c really diminishes the achievement of high school graduation and college graduation, which are milestones\n\nThe only one of these \"extra\" graduations that had a place was middle school, when that would be the highest level of education for a bunch of folks before they went and worked the family farm.\n\nMeaningless in the states now, but at least there is some historical context with it vs the bullshit preschool stuff.", "My parents definitely celebrated the end of each school year with me but my district never did graduations other than HS. It was always like \u201cyay you completed the grade and now it\u2019s summer let\u2019s celebrate!\u201d With dinner or ice cream or something. I\u2019ve always thought anything other than HS and college graduation is weird. Completing grade 5 can definitely be an accomplishment but I don\u2019t think it qualifies for a whole graduation ceremony.", "I can\u2019t tell if this is a joke or not \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "Oh no, I read the post. Why does eldest daughter only get mom but the twins get dad, brothers, aunts, and uncles? Mom\u2019s the one throwing a hissy fit because dad wants to see his eldest daughter on a big milestone day. Mom IS favoring the twins.", "would it be super cool if they, for instance, were forced to repeat the grade? transitioning from middle school to high school can be nerve-wracking for some. graduating from middle school is proof that they're smart and capable of excelling onwards.", "So why doesn\u2019t she go to the pointless ceremony (and yes it is pointless!) and let him go to the one he cares about. \n\nProbably because she knows she\u2019s got the better deal & she doesn\u2019t want to go to the pointless one either!", "I mean, if OP\u2019s wife wants to make sure all kids have a parent and OP reallllly wants to attend high school then SHE should do middle school.", "From UK did not realise this. But still maintain they made a commitment and are now going back on it. Regardless of it not being an 'important' milestone. Your word is your word. If you go back on it, its an AH move.", "Yeah everyone saying go to thr HS graduation bc the other is just pointless... I mean... the ceremony for HS grad also is pointless, you graduate anyway, lol.\n\nIt's an important moment for them. If I was either of them and NEITHER of my parents came bc they BOTH chose my sister's milestone I'd be devastated.", "Right? Whole family going to a middle school \u201cgraduation\u201d and only 1 going to the highschool graduation is actually ridiculous.", "OP said that the family members are being split for each graduation:\n\n> My wife and I decided that half of the family will attend the twins middle school graduation, and the other half will attend our eldest daughter high school graduation.\n\nNow, OP never clarified who would be attending their eldest's graduation, but it sounds like potential cousins or other aunts/uncles and grandparents, maybe? Since grandparents weren't mentioned in the post.", "The plan was we would split it in half. So my wife, grandparents, and one of her brothers, would be at my oldest daughters graduation. Me, their aunt, uncles, and two of my sons would be at my twin\u2019s graduation. If that makes any sense.", "Did OP suggest that? No, he suggested that both parents go to the ceremony. If he suggested they switch ceremonies and the wife said no, that would be a different story.", "OP didn\u2019t suggest that though. OP suggested that both parents go to the eldest daughter\u2019s ceremony.", "That is a fair point.", "We don\u2019t know that OP told the twins they were going to be there. It actually reads to me like the parents haven\u2019t discussed any of this with any of the kids yet.", "Then they are breaking an agreement with their wife still?"]}
