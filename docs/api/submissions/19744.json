No diploma is conferred. Your older daughter actually is graduating from high school and receiving a diploma.", "Perhaps bring this up with all the daughters together. Let them know that you both wish you could attend all of their graduations, but due to the timing it isn\u2019t possible. See how your daughters feel. \n\nThen plan to do something special with the daughter/daughters whose graduation you miss. If you miss the twins do a special outing with them. If you miss the older daughters do one with her. Your wife should also do this for the twins as well regardless if you end up going to the twins.", "NTA. There is only two graduations that count, High school and college. The rest is just passing from one grade to another.", "NTA\n\nOkay, simple solution: swap with the wife. Say that if she feels so strongly about it, she goes to the middle school graduation, and you go to the high school one. Her reaction will tell you how she really feels about it.\n\nTo be honest, the whole situation is just unfortunate and showcases some very lackluster planning by the school board. Maybe just the counties I grew up in, but high schools, middle schools, and elementary schools all have their graduations at separate times.

There\u2019s just not enough info in OP to know if he actually TOLD the twins he would be there or if it was just a conversation between him and his wife. I would assume the twins know, and taking back that commitment to them is more of a jerk move than the actual attending or not. If that makes sense. But these are teenage girls, it\u2019s an opportunity to teach them lines of communication and have them be heard as well. It\u2019s a tough spot. I\u2019m so glad I only have one for these reasons", "H-how?", "If my father said that to me I wouldn\u2019t even want him in my life anymore.", "I mean I'm in the camp that middle school graduations are pointless and stupid. It is just not failing 8th grade. When I finished middle school we had a school dance, a field day, and goodbyes. Nothing parents would come to, cus it's not a big deal.\n\nBut I agree with you in that it sounds like OP told his daughters he would be there and then he has a responsibility to go instead of backing out on them.", "I remember the transition into both highschool and graduating highschool and know which one was more important and which one was a bigger deal. you all acting like these kids will one: actually give a shit about this middle school graduation, and two: even remember if their parents showed up or not, are ridiculous. kids are not so soft and fragile as you'd like to believe. God forbid someone tell the kids that moving from middle school to highschool is basically no different than any other grade they've moved on from. the biggest adjustment is moving to a new school, and that doesn't require a pointless ceremony", "graduating middle school is not an accomplishment", "Ok then his wife should have no problem going to the twins ceremony. Win win", "yes, how equal it is that they'll get both parents present at their *actual* milestone graduation while their older sister gets one \ud83d\ude44", "college graduations do not happen the same time as high school graduations.", "The schools in my county just do them at the school but all the high schools have football stadiums.", "Here (I live in a huge district) high schools get the priority. They finish school a week or so earlier than everyone else, and their ceremonies are spread over two venues (the downtown arena where our pro basketball team plays or the large local university\u2019s arena). So for that whole week, it\u2019s roughly 4 a day, one in the AM/one in the afternoon, until they\u2019re done.\n\nMiddle/elementary/preschools tend to work around them and host their stuff in their cafeteria/auditorium on school evenings. I\u2019ve never attended anything outside of a high school graduation anywhere but at the school itself. These \u201cother\u201d graduations are treated more like awards nights/send off events. They\u2019re not proper or official on anyway (likes with robes or diplomas), just school events like open house would be.", "Exactly, no way they can or will coordinate graduation, sports, recital etc schedules so everybody can be everywhere, every time. OP will definitely BTA if they call and complain to the school district.", "I think I \"graduated\" middle school in 1992 and I'm pretty sure all we got was.. to go to 9th grade. I think this whole thing is a racket run by Big Cap and Gown.", "Same here I went to middle school then moved and ended up in Jr. High in the 9th grade no graduation for either. Where I am from graduation is kindergarten, elementary, and high school. There is no middle or jr. high graduations. We had a dance in both 8th and 9th grades. We went to Disney in 9th grade as the \"official\" school outing for graduation day. We had discounted tickets from the parents organization raising money. It was the last \"field trip\" I ever had... it was fun.", "You got slightly more than us", "Mine had pre k through 12 in one building.", "Dang", "Dang", "Same. It was a nothing burger, even at the time.", "\n\n>I mean... the ceremony for HS grad also is pointless\n\nmaybe, but its certainly a bigger deal to graduation high school over middle school.", "I\u2019m not American and we don\u2019t have the same \u2018graduation\u2019 ceremonies in the UK but, based on things I\u2019ve seen online, don\u2019t some people not graduate highschool? Like they get kept back for years or drop-out? Also surely you have final exams at the end of high-school? That like actually matter to graduation/futures? Because to me that\u2019s what makes high-school graduation so much of a bigger deal, it\u2019s an actual achievement that takes most people a lot more effort than middle-school.\n\nObviously both ceremonies/occasions signify a big shift to a new phase of life but I feel like the high-school one easily outweighs in that department. It marks a transition to adulthood and likely either the end of education or imminent moving away for college. Imo send grandparents/other relatives to the middle school one and make a special point of doing something with the kids after the ceremonies so they don\u2019t feel devalued. I can\u2019t imagine how devastated I\u2019d be if my sister was finishing primary school and my parents ditched my (hypothetical) end of sixth form ceremony to go to her\u2019s instead", "I graduated HS the same year my brother graduated college, and it wasn't remotely an issue because HS graduations are almost always in June and college graduations are in May.", "She had already stated that she really wanted to go to the HS one.", "Sending one parent to each graduation is the fairest option. It can\u2019t be helped that graduation is on the same day. And it\u2019s not right to deprive the younger children of both their parents on what is, for them, a milestone. \n\nLife is not fair. And the younger girls are entitled to their parents support, as well.", "Depends on the state she will go to. School starts and ends different times.", "Our stadiums are outdoors and we would be too much at the mercy of the elements. School's here do it at a convention Center/stadium and a different school every 4 hours. Although the middle schools do it in their own gymnasiums.", "For many it represents the transition to adulthood, so yeah... \n\nMiddle school graduation is just marking a transition into high school.", "so? what, the twins get to have their whole family present when they graduate high school, but fuck the older daughter cause half the family has to be present at a pointless ceremony that most of the kids don't even want to be at? both parents should be at the high school graduation. this shouldn't have even been up for debate to begin with.", "Sounds more like a continuing discussion over breaking an agreement.  If he said he would go and then didn't, that would be breaking an agreement.  If the event hasn't happened, and changes can be made, I don't see anything wrong with letting your partner know you had thought about it more and wanted to make some changes.", "The backup plan is an indoor ceremony in the gym. They give you 14 tickets, all of the can be used for the outdoor graduation but only 7 for the indoor graduation. They are different colors.", "The one that is more of a milestone/important is the Highschool graduation, it's almost like a mini-sendoff into the real world/adulthood and is the culmination of 12 years of hopefully hard work."]}
