I had to call around to a bunch of different stores but I managed to get one in for her, discounted as well because I\u2019m staff. Once she returned from overseas she immediately had a go at me for not taking good care of the cats, saying that they didn\u2019t have any wet food (which she never mentioned), and saying that she was really upset and disappointed.

It does sound like she\u2019s making up excuses to get out of paying you.\n\nYour way of exacting the money that you are owed sounds okay but it might escalate your conflict with her. Maybe just tell her that whatever her problem with your catsitting, she still owes you $200 and of she doesn\u2019t pay up then you plan to exact it by returning the product. This way she has a chance to change the consequences of her actions if she is unhappy with the arrangement.", "The cats were alive, healthy and unharmed when she got back. She owes you $200.

In cash, no checks. Otherwise you will return her item and give her the balance over 200.", "I'm assuming you followed the instructions given for cat care -- except for the, I guess, psychically transmitted info about wet food. If that's the case. NTA. I have a STRONG feeling that your sister never intended to pay you for your time, and that she's seeking an excuse to withhold funds (\"You didn't feed them the wet food I never told you about.\"", "NTa. She is just selfish, looking for excuses not to pay you what you are owed.", "YWNBTA. If she wants it, she can pay for it. There's no reason why you should be out of pocket.", "YWNBTA. She just invented a reason to not pay you. I like your solution.", "NTA. She went looking for any excuse to not pay you because she just didn't want to pay you.\n\nReturning her item is the wrong strategy, though. You're better off treating her as a deadbeat. You retain the moral high ground.\n\nAny time she wants something from you, \"You still owe me $200.\" Any time she wants you to do something for her and is willing to pay, \"You still owe me $200, and as you're a deadbeat, I'd need that back plus payment in advance, because you can't be trusted.\"", "A lot of people resell items.

Granted, the plan you have is a decent one but be prepared for the inevitable backlash. She\u2019s gonna raise hell because she never planned on being out $200.

Perhaps also let her know you went out of your way and phoned around different stores to get that product she wanted. \n\nIf not, then make sure you do that first. Try to talk it out first, before resorting to returning the product, as that will only escalate tensions, which you want to avoid if a conversation will sort it out easier.", "NTA. You could always give her a choice. (1) She can pay you normally, as promised. (2) She can pay you via liquidation of the product and find one at full price on her own. Or (3) she can pay you after losing her case in small claims court, plus court costs. Up to her.", "NTA \n\nYou took care of them. If she never mentioned the wet food that's on her am d clearly cats don't die from not having wet food for a while. Seems to me she is looking for an excuse not to pay. Unlikely you would ecer fet the money otherwise than sending the item back.", "NTA. Return the product and let her find it on her own. Return all the money and never help her again without getting paid first. $200 isn't worth arguing with her about. Lesson learned.", "First don\u2019t do  any more favors for her.  \nLet her know that due to lack of payment you are going to return item and return the Money, she will lose the discount and the item. Give her a time limit, see if she pays you. Why should you do that favor when she cheated you", "ESH, she clearly is an asshole, what you want to do is in AH territory.\n\nFirst of all what relationship you want with your sister, what you asked is a way to ruin any future relation with her. Talk with her, say your points, she never mentioned wet food, not in the initial instructions or in any interaction you had with her later, if she insists, just say you are disappointed with her attitude.
