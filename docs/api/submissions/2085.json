No jealousy, she\u2019s now married herself, it\u2019s all fine. \n\nExcept! She makes comments about their relationship that annoy me from time to time.

She kind of did it again! Like, saying isn\u2019t it so funny how mellow he gets after he\u2019s drinking or other random stuff like before.

First of all, you will not wipe out the memory of relationships he had before you.  What you can do is remind yourself that he married you and strive to make your own relationship as strong and rich as it can be.

You stooped not just to her level, but below it. You're in charge of you, and nothing she does justifies what you do. I get not liking her comments, I wouldn't either. But YOU are the one married to him and should have let that speak for itself.", "NTA how could she possibly be offended by the fact you fuck your husband? How is that a slight to her? It\u2019s not like you said you made a joke about fucking her husband.", "YTA, she's probably just trying to find common ground and doesn't think much about talking about him. If it bothers you, say something, but what you did was passive aggressive and immature.", "NTA\n\nLOL", "NTA. How long does he leave the shampoo in for?", "NTA. She had it coming. She was trying to get on your nerves. I had something similar happen with my BF's ex. You should finish her off by having sex with her husband... to assert dominance.\nJust remember - her husband, your rules.", "YTA, her comments might be inappropriate and annoying but she might not know that, whereas you were just being petty and very inappropriate", "NTA.

You guys shouldn't have her around anymore but just so you know this behavior isn't ok even though you have the majority NTA vote because your a woman . If this was switched all the way around people would say exactly what I did in an even harsher way .

Look OP's comment was to put her in her place and it worked. And then the ex had nerve to say it wasn't cool.

And I understand being uncomfortable around exes. But I think that if you\u2019re still going to allow her to be around, you might want to think of her comments coming from a different perspective. But you\u2019re also allowed to tell Husband that her presence makes you uncomfortable and you\u2019d rather she didn\u2019t come over.", "NTA\nYour comment was petty but she was being petty too.\nSo I loved your response lol\nAnswer her text by saying that what isn't cool are the comments she is throwing off sometimes about her past and your husband's.\nAnd please get her out of your life I don't understand we she is in, to the point that she stays at your home.", "NTA, why was she even there?", "YTA, get over it. She's not saying anything out of line, she's talking about her past and reminiscing about him as a person. Its not her YOU seem jealous and territorial.

It is not appropriate to have someone that\u2019s saying the things she is stay in your home. Time to set up boundaries with your husband about limiting interactions with this woman until she learns to grow up and be decent. She wouldn\u2019t like one of her husband\u2019s ex\u2019s pulling this so stop tolerating.", "NTA. She was definitely giving off \u2018I know him well\u2019 and \u2018I was there\u2019 vibes. You trusted your guts and were validated by her response. Nothing wrong with what you did by showing her place belongs in the past and that it is highly inappropriate to talk about it with a current partner of her ex.", "NTA but personally I wouldn't have her staying in my house. Like being cordial out with mutual friends is one thing that doesnt mean you guys need to keep her around lol.", "This is why I do not promote exes staying as friends. How will you ever know what her true intentions are?? If you call her on it, you will be the bad guy who is jealous of the ex, and if you keep quiet, you will be bothered and naive. Somehow you will always be the bad guy in such a case scenario. And no, do not apologize, even if tbh what you said was tacky (no offense) you have no reason to apologize for it. Btw, the fact that she was so bothered by it is a major red flag if I were even to consider her as a mutual friend.\n\nI am sorry but I suggest both you and your husband break the friendship. My brother in law's ex wife does this to his new fiancee and it just stinks of insecurities to me. She has a son with him so I see how they cannot technically stop being friends, but in your husband's case with his ex there is nothing connecting them anymore. These are insecure women and will always remain so. I also suspect that she never really felt the passion burn out, but since it probably had for your husband, she claimed the same or your husband might have interpreted it the same way. It isn't her fault that she is insecure, but at the same time insecure women do not just magically get over a situation like that.\n\nMy BIL's ex is also constantly making a comment about how my husband used to take her out and grocery shopping when his brother had to travel or how he told her once that she looks better without make up (YES my husband LOL. And the only reason why my husband told her she looks better without make up is because she doesn't even know how to put it on and keeps looking ridiculous with it.) As a result I completely cannot stand dealing with her and I bet my BIL's fiancee will soon get tired of her crap. She has probably not dealt enough with her yet to start getting annoyed by her, but it is definitely something I can predict.\n\nListen she could be married, and your husband happily married,  but you will never know if SHE is happily married. She can claim something and feel something else. At this point none of you are in a transparent relationship with her, so no one can ever know her true intentions.\n\nYou should feel happy that you are such a threat to her. It probably proves that you do seem to be happy with your husband and that she is jealous to a certain extent. Do not be bothered by the crap she says because it is genuinely not worth it. This could also put pressure between you and your husband. \n\nI think you should sit down with him and have a serious conversation about how you should not be friends with her anymore. State all the facts and now that this has happened you have evidence too. Really, what a headache that isn't worth it when your sole purpose with him is to start a family and not create trouble for anyone.", "NTA. Ex should bury the past now that even she herself is married. If you don't feel comfortable with her mentioning the past, her current partner probably feels the same. She should move on or keep her distance until she finally move on.\n\n Friends or no friends, my trust issue would never let partner's ex stay under the same roof with us. There are so many possibilities of the ex trying to rekindle things or even harm us. Plus hotels aren't that expensive. If she can afford to attend the trip for baby shower, surely she can afford a cheap hotel room.", "As someone who is still very good friends with my ex and even better friends with their partner, the one thing we never discuss is the time I was dating my ex.  Politics, religion all good; dating history no.\n\nThe only comment I have ever made (15 years after they were married) is how much more suited their partner is for them and I made that comment to their partner who just laughed.  For the first few years they were married, I made sure never to be alone with the just ex so no one else could make comment.\n\nThe ex might be deliberately doing this or may just be clueless (some people really are that clueless).  Either way it's disrespectful of everyone.\n\nNTA.", "YTA. \nComments regarding past trips, the previous apartment, etc are topics that would naturally come up in conversation\u2026 especially if they\u2019re an ex. like another commenter said it could be a way of trying to bond especially if all parties involved are moved on with a spouse. I feel like having to make the statement that you\u2019re fucking him is a bit much and territorial. There\u2019s jealousy written in your post which I understand but it\u2019s a subject that should be discussed with your husband\u2026", "ESH. Are you really adults in your 30\u2019s? You sound like high schoolers.", "Haha yes! I love that you did this", "NTA and if she makes your uncomfortable why do you guys keep her in your life?

Their primary shared hobby is banging the same dude, it\u2019s so weird to be jealous of her mentioning that she\u2019s seen him shampooing his hair.", "I agree.

You can\u2019t be friends with an ex.  You can be amicable, but friends is BS.  Someone is only still there because they want the other one back.  And trust me OP, ex is just biding her time waiting for you two to have a problem so she can swoop on in.  \n\nGet her out of your relationship.", "That's all nice and dandy... But when they are making my partner upset with remarks then it's better they sleep elsewhere", "OP.. I\u2019d seriously be questioning why your husband still has her in his life.  This whole situation is not normal", "It\u2019s very odd to spend so much time telling randos how you\u2019re TOTALLY fucking your husband like 24/7 all the time for reals while also being a denizen of deadbedrooms, lol. \n\nThis seems more like you being overly sensitive that your relationship is fizzling out sexually in the same way that theirs did, and you don\u2019t want him to leave you the same way.", "What did she even talk about that was appropriate. He leaves shampoo in his hair. Grow up", "Oh you got her", "I think I witnessed a murder"]}
