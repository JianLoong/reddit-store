Like being cordial out with mutual friends is one thing that doesnt mean you guys need to keep her around lol.", "This is why I do not promote exes staying as friends. How will you ever know what her true intentions are?? If you call her on it, you will be the bad guy who is jealous of the ex, and if you keep quiet, you will be bothered and naive. Somehow you will always be the bad guy in such a case scenario. And no, do not apologize, even if tbh what you said was tacky (no offense) you have no reason to apologize for it. Btw, the fact that she was so bothered by it is a major red flag if I were even to consider her as a mutual friend.\n\nI am sorry but I suggest both you and your husband break the friendship. My brother in law's ex wife does this to his new fiancee and it just stinks of insecurities to me. She has a son with him so I see how they cannot technically stop being friends, but in your husband's case with his ex there is nothing connecting them anymore. These are insecure women and will always remain so. I also suspect that she never really felt the passion burn out, but since it probably had for your husband, she claimed the same or your husband might have interpreted it the same way. It isn't her fault that she is insecure, but at the same time insecure women do not just magically get over a situation like that.\n\nMy BIL's ex is also constantly making a comment about how my husband used to take her out and grocery shopping when his brother had to travel or how he told her once that she looks better without make up (YES my husband LOL. And the only reason why my husband told her she looks better without make up is because she doesn't even know how to put it on and keeps looking ridiculous with it.) As a result I completely cannot stand dealing with her and I bet my BIL's fiancee will soon get tired of her crap. She has probably not dealt enough with her yet to start getting annoyed by her, but it is definitely something I can predict.\n\nListen she could be married, and your husband happily married,  but you will never know if SHE is happily married. She can claim something and feel something else. At this point none of you are in a transparent relationship with her, so no one can ever know her true intentions.\n\nYou should feel happy that you are such a threat to her. It probably proves that you do seem to be happy with your husband and that she is jealous to a certain extent. Do not be bothered by the crap she says because it is genuinely not worth it. This could also put pressure between you and your husband. \n\nI think you should sit down with him and have a serious conversation about how you should not be friends with her anymore. State all the facts and now that this has happened you have evidence too. Really, what a headache that isn't worth it when your sole purpose with him is to start a family and not create trouble for anyone.", "NTA. Ex should bury the past now that even she herself is married. If you don't feel comfortable with her mentioning the past, her current partner probably feels the same. She should move on or keep her distance until she finally move on.\n\n Friends or no friends, my trust issue would never let partner's ex stay under the same roof with us. There are so many possibilities of the ex trying to rekindle things or even harm us. Plus hotels aren't that expensive. If she can afford to attend the trip for baby shower, surely she can afford a cheap hotel room.", "As someone who is still very good friends with my ex and even better friends with their partner, the one thing we never discuss is the time I was dating my ex.  Politics, religion all good; dating history no.\n\nThe only comment I have ever made (15 years after they were married) is how much more suited their partner is for them and I made that comment to their partner who just laughed.  For the first few years they were married, I made sure never to be alone with the just ex so no one else could make comment.\n\nThe ex might be deliberately doing this or may just be clueless (some people really are that clueless).  Either way it's disrespectful of everyone.\n\nNTA.", "YTA. \nComments regarding past trips, the previous apartment, etc are topics that would naturally come up in conversation\u2026 especially if they\u2019re an ex. like another commenter said it could be a way of trying to bond especially if all parties involved are moved on with a spouse. I feel like having to make the statement that you\u2019re fucking him is a bit much and territorial.

You can\u2019t be friends with an ex.  You can be amicable, but friends is BS.  Someone is only still there because they want the other one back.

Nothing she said was blatantly out of line. \n\n1. She's allowed to talk about their apartment and the trips they took together. I get that hearing ex-relationship stories isn't always super fun, but sometimes you have to grin and bear it. Telling stories about HER former life with her now-friend and your now-husband does not mean she's being territorial. You can't really expect her to stay silent about an entire 6 years of her life.\n\n2. Mentioning his shampoo habits seems pretty harmless. Obviously she's seen him naked literally hundreds of times, so why would she need to send messages reminding you of that?  It sounds more like being around the two of you is sparking memories for her, and she thinks it's okay to laugh with you about them, since you both know him so well and you're all secure in your present relationships. \n\nI don't think you handled this very well.  You resurrected the shampoo comment, hours later, just so you could take control and escalate it to something obviously intended to shock her and shut her down. Vindictive jealously is never a good look. \n\nEven if she actually was being territorial and competitive for some reason, you could have easily taken the high road much sooner and politely told her that you'd rather not talk about your husband's habits and quirks with her.

She's shitty, sure, but not all ex-partners are.", "I'm so glad I'm not the only one who sees it that way. I'm so embarrassed for OP. No, you're not an asshole..... But God you made yourself pathetic.", "You know she doesn\u2019t talk about her previous shower experience with your husband to her husband. I\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t stand to hear that talk. She\u2019s being a manipulative person and let me follow up, why didn\u2019t her husband come along?", "Are you Charles Boyle or something? Leaving shampoo in for too long is not really sexy.", "Not so much sensitive as overcompensating. Your comment history says it all. You felt threatened and fought back. Why is she around anyway?", "Unusual maybe, but weird?", "I guess for someone who might be insecure.", "Aaaand this is your true colours.  That and your post history.  \n\nJust awful.", "YTA. You could\u2019ve been an adult and said \u201cyour comments about my husband makes me uncomfortable\u201d. Instead you went out of your way to tell her about you and your husband having sex. That\u2019s not okay. You don\u2019t even know why she said those things. She might just be trying to connect with you about something you have in common, which is knowing and caring about your husband.", "Tbh YTA. I think her comments sound silly and maybe she wasn't thinking about it like that. Even if she was, mildly an asshole but mostly childish.\n\nYou on the other hand, pretty sure that \"territorial vibe\" is from YOU. You're projecting your insecurities all over this situation. People have sex. They have lives before you, get over it.", "YTA - They dated for six years and knew each other for longer than that. It's like a lifelong friend. She clearly moved on, she's married. I feel that you're jealous of the fact that she knows things about him and has pleasant memories about their time together. You need to realise that you're his wife, you'll be the one to grow up with him, you won. You don't have to embarrass her, yourself and your husband by being improper in social setting. No-one needs to know if you have sex in the shower with your husband.", "She\u2019s mad about your comment? Enough to text you and tell you\u2026 that\u2019s strange to me. Sounds like this stuff affects her, she\u2019s probably not over him/their relationship.", "ESH. Y'all are in your 30s. Sure she may be snarky but you stewing for hours and coming back to it saying well I fuck him...like...come on. You need to speak with your husband about this and tell him why your bothered. If she is going to still be around you can always speak to her like an adult. I think they way she was commenting is literally because he is your thing in common. She could be being a big old B *ch but she honestly may just be like hahaha he still does the shampoo thing. I get why you could get bothered but this chick shows up in your life maybe what a handful of times a year. I would just put it to bed. But either way y'all are adults and are both married. Maybe act like it.", "I mean, ESH, but you're the main AH.", "This whole post was uncomfortable to read", "Maybe she feels awkward and he\u2019s the only thing you have in common so talks about him", "NTA.

Stop that toxic friendship what so ever ,cut contact with her and don't open the door to potentials bad things that's not healthy!!\n\nPs: you respond well, she know exactly what she doing and what she said was very inappropriate!  Another proof that you need to cut her off even your husband!!", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m not understanding why are you hanging out with her? You don\u2019t seem like you want to be her friend so I\u2019m not understanding the reason behind that. She basically reminding you she had your man. Just nip the whole fake friendliness in the bud. Stop whatever this weird thing you all got going on. Leave the ex girlfriend in the past where she belongs. Let\u2019s be clear he damn sure wouldn\u2019t be buddy buddy with your ex.", "I think that OP was just keeping it classy until it was the last straw. She did the right thing by addressing it without being all dramatic or confrontational. For those saying she should've involved her partner in this...why? To blow it up? It wasn't this huge thing, but it was a building up of \"Okay, come on. Really?\" Definitely NTA The ex knew what she was doing.", "NTA", "NTA seems pretty deliberate. But I would definitely have a chat with the hubby about her lack of boundaries.", "NTA. It\u2019s interesting many are saying the opposite and that the ex is simply trying to find common ground with you. You don\u2019t need to describe your past private life with your ex to find common ground with his current wife. Talk movies, hobbies, talk about the countries/places you visited (without tying to whom those trips may have been with). But to discuss intimate details feels inappropriate, potentially hurtful to the current spouse. \n\nI do think you should have taken the high ground and not retaliated with your response, but her reaction is curious. She\u2019s married, no? There\u2019s no reason your response should bother her. Again though, try to take the high ground in future events, set clear boundaries with her, and talk with your husband about the uncomfortable commentary from his ex.", "Hahahaha you certainly owned that exchange. She was trying to flex and she lost the battle badly. NTA. But you have nothing to feel insecure about. She is an ex for a reason.", "YTA\n\nGuess what the only thing you and this lady have in common. Yes, your husband. Maybe she's nervous, just trying to make conversation? Maybe she's trying to make jokes to acknowledge that you married her ex, and is picking up on the vibe that you don't like her? Even if she is making particular digs, does it fucking matter? He's moved on, she's moved on, do her snide remarks really bother you *that much* that you're willing to make an enemy of a woman who your partner clearly likes and respects, and is in your lives? \n\nYou need to apologise, and if she does it again, just ignore it. It's called the high road - take it.", "Yikes, insecure much? This is a person who you only know through your husband. You two have no shared history. The only way to connect at all is by talking about your husband. Your reading into every comment she makes. Territorial vibe? Yes, there is a distinct territorial vibe here. From you. Because your jealous and insecure. YTA.", "NTA but why are you having her stay in your home even though you know she does this? It\u2019s weird and inviting trouble to start (if it hasn\u2019t already).", "YTA", "YTA. Most of the stuff she was saying was just making conversation quality and you just had to make it weird.", "I have a story from a opposite side.\n\nI was with my ex from age 21 to 29. We had a daughter together after several miscarriages when I was 27. We had a bunch of issues, partly from being so young when we got together, and the nail in the coffin for our relationship was when I nearly died from an ectopic pregnancy and he refused to bring our daughter to the hospital to say (a potential) goodbye. \n\nI moved out with our daughter and he moved on FAST. They were married less than a year after I moved out. \n\nA year after their wedding, we went on holiday to the same place to get some kind of co-parenting dynamic settled. \n\nAt least that was the plan.\n\nIt was so awkward. The new wife sat there blatantly reading 50 shades of Grey, and loudly commenting \"oooh, we need to try this!\" And occasionally grinning at me saying things like \"I had to teach him sooo much. He hardly knew what he was doing in bed...\"  I gave a half-hearted \"I'm easily pleased\" and thought that was the end of it until he told me to stop trying to make her jealous. \n\nI wasn't allowed to mention restaurants we'd been to at that location or ask if he wanted a drink if I was getting myself one. My daughter wanted a photo of herself with me and her dad and that was apparently the worst crime since Eve helped herself to an apple... Everything I did in a friendly manner was interpreted by her as wanting him back.\n\nI swear. It took 15 years for me and him to co-parent like adults because she would claim I was interfering in their marriage every time I tried to extend any offer of friendship. We had fights over the phone followed by another fight because the wife thought fighting =passion= still emotional attachment. \n\nA mutual friend offered several times to go with my ex to visit our daughter in our town, but the wife refused saying that I was out to seduce him, despite the fact I've been in a new relationship since my child was 4..\n\nMy now 17 year old daughter could have had a much better relationship with her dad if his new wife hadn't  put on the brakes. My daughter now sees her dad as a stranger. And it's not because my ex and I didn't want to, it was all because this insecure wife denied it.\n\n\nMy advice is to chill out. She's not trying to piss on her pole and mark her territory, she's probably just got a bunch of good memories with a man she now considers a friend. \nHave a honest conversation with her instead of being so passive aggressive and posessive.\n\n\nAll in all a mild YTA, verging on N A H.", "NTA for your comment but stop hanging out with her. Problem solved", "NTA but why is she with you???", "ESA.\n\nHe is the AH for cultivating a relationship with an ex that might threaten his current (or her) relationship.\n\nShe is an AH for cultivating a relationship with an ex that might threaten her current (or his) relationship.\n\nYou are the AH for being disingenuous and childish. If you really must be besties (fucking stupid imo) then when she says things that you don't appreciate then say so instead of acting like a bitter high schooler. It is entirely possible that she is just aloof and is being genuinely friendly and trying to make common ground by talking about his quirks with you and doesn't consider that it makes you feel insecure, because you are deliberately hiding that because you think you are in some high school competition over boys. In which case you hit below the belt by making a dig at their lack of sex life contributing to their break up and showed that you are cringey and petty. It is also entirely possible that she is intentionally trying to make you feel uncomfortable and insecure, in which case why in the everliving fuck are you and your husband even acknowledging her existence, let alone hosting her for fucking pyjama parties lol.\n\nKick her to the curb and grow up!", "NTA. It may have been better to have simply told her you thought it was inappropriate for her to keep making comments like that, however. But I would reply back that she was the one who brought up her ex's showering habits, and that she makes comments like that often (give examples) and it also makes you uncomfortable that she seems to find the need to point out her intimate past with your spouse. Call her out on it.\n\nAnd don't let her stay with you again.", "NTA. I\u2019d ask her what wasn\u2019t cool about what I said. I hate when people like to dish it but can\u2019t take it. Well done!", "Actually sort of hilarious. She was trying to pee on your husband and you came out as the apex predator with the stronger scent. If she wants to tell cute shower stories about your husband - so can you.\n\nNTA", "NTA OP.  If I had been you, I would have gotten nauseatingly detailed in what happened in the shower.  That would have put her off for good.", "Right...\"so anyway, she was staying with us for a few days...\"\n\nI'm sorry, what?", "Yup- had to reread that.", "I had to read that part a couple of times.", "This.

My ex is a great guy, we had an amicable breakup, and we\u2019re on good terms. We don\u2019t hang out regularly, but we too have been to mutual friends weddings and other events etc. Hubby has met him and thinks he\u2019s a good guy/has no issues with him.\n\n\u2026.THIS IS WEIRD. Like, thinking or talking about my ex in any sort of sexual manner is so cringe in general never mind to his wife \ud83e\udd2e It\u2019s like we were so close that to move on from that, you have to put ex in a close friend category and my brain just does not go there with him at ALL or any of my friends for that matter.\n\nKnowing what it\u2019s like to be married and have an ex like this and seeing how this chick is acting is super, super cringe. She seems at best immature, insecure, and territorial. You really have nothing else to bond over with another grown woman? And why tf would she be offended about hIs WIFE fucking him? \n\nJust ew. There is absolutely no reason to be bringing up intimate details from a decade ago.\n\nOP, NTA. But don\u2019t even give her petty shit the time of day. You were right to snap a little sense in to her.", "I had the same impression, tbh\n\nLike, she was (in a weird way) trying to \"bond\" with you over \"shared experiences\".\n\nI once had a boyfriend who was still good friends with his ex and she and her bonded pretty quickly over us \"shit talking\" (but in a loving way, he joined us sometimes and dished it right back lol) about him and stuff he did... she said stuff like \"is he still such a pillow-hogger?\" or \"isn't it weird how he has this very specific bathroom routine every morning?\" and shared stories about him and then I would share a story and we all would laugh about it... \n\nTo me it sounds like OP is the territorial one tbh.", "I have an ex of six years. I\u2019m also happily married. I am on great terms with my ex and hubby has no issues with him. When we see ex, ex and I do not talk about our old apartment and trips we took. That is so weird and cringe. And yes, it is territorial. Its giving \u201cI was here first and look how clooooooosee we are\u201d vibes. Idk when we see each other we catch up and have lots to chat about but we aren\u2019t telling stories about our couples trips to St. Barths.\n\nYour second point. To me, (btw I\u2019m 32) my ex and our relationship back THEN is a memory from the past. Even the thought of his initiate shower habits is weird to think about and I would NEVER bond with his wife about how we both have fucked the same guy aka your husband in the shower. Gross and disrespectful. My brain doesn\u2019t even go there with him anymore and it shouldn\u2019t. Ex and I have a different relationship now rooted in the present. These kinds of women (and men) are why people think exes can\u2019t have legitimate friendships. \n\nOP made exgf feel stupid and uncomfortable because she was saying stupid things.

Y\u2019all are weird letting exes stay over and don\u2019t try and normalize it just because y\u2019all are weirdos.", "Yeah, the ex is messing with the current partner and trying to get under her skin and trigger jealousy. The ex possibly doesn't like seeing another woman make her ex happy, when she wasn't able to.\n\nThe op should suggest that the ex stays somewhere else, and then try to reduce the number of social events that she will be at.", "Oh Yeah! I just realised how shady of a dig that was! I thought OP's comment came off as cringey and insecure before you pointed out that connection, but now I think it was intentionally catty.", "Fully agree with your whole assessment, especially the 3am comment \ud83d\ude02", "the ex didn\u2019t bring up anything intimate", "Right on the money", "Hahaha 10/10 comment!"]}
